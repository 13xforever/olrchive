00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:23,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, April 29th, 2007, Sony loses a well-known executive, the PlayStation is set to get an eye, is Tron on the way to Xbox Live Arcade?

2
00:00:31,923 --> 00:00:36,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:41,166
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:42,546
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:46,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:47,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I have pitas.

7
00:00:48,428 --> 00:00:48,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Pitas.

8
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:49,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.

9
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:52,209
[SPEAKER_02]: You're eating a salad thingy from Quiznos?

10
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:53,129
[SPEAKER_05]: From Quiznos.

11
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:53,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,471
[SPEAKER_05]: This show is indirectly sponsored by Quiznos and Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi.

13
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:00,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Quiznos is pretty good stuff.

14
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:01,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I like their salads.

15
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:02,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Food Network.

16
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:09,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say Diet Wild Cherry.

17
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:12,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not very wild if it's diet.

18
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:15,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but if you read the ingredients, it is pretty wild.

19
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:19,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucralose and whatever else is in the...

20
00:01:20,274 --> 00:01:22,336
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that, aspartame or sucralose that sweetens that?

21
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:24,017
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be aspartame.

22
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:25,137
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, no one really gives a shit.

23
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:34,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, also joining us tonight, we have somebody brand new who's never been on this program before, and that's something else, because usually it's the same old freaking people in and out of here, like Grand Central Station.

24
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:35,228
[SPEAKER_02]: O.L.R.

25
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:35,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Listener

26
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:11,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably two or more years ago, it was right before iTunes started giving everybody podcasts.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

28
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I got an iPod, I wanted podcasts, I like radio, let's look for all the good radio shows.

29
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:17,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, cool.

30
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:20,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just stopped listening to most of them, except this one.

31
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:21,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

32
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:21,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I liked it.

33
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:22,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucker.

34
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:22,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

35
00:02:23,048 --> 00:02:23,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

36
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:24,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good time.

37
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:25,830
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you're here, where were you living before?

38
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was living in San Luis Obispo, going to college, but I'm originally from about an hour, maybe 40 minutes east of here.

39
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:33,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Soundless Obispo is not that far from here.

40
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:35,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about a four or five hour drive.

41
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Five or six, depending on how you drive.

42
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:39,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a conservative.

43
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:40,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

44
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:43,411
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you're here because you grew up in this area, so cool.

45
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, very cool.

46
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:44,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

47
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.

48
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:45,953
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

49
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: We like having new people.

50
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially guests that bring their own mics.

51
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:49,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

52
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:50,657
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

53
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:51,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how this one would work.

54
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,218
[SPEAKER_02]: This mic, this guy brought us more...

55
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:58,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got Final Fantasy Advance 6 that Dan just bought for me that I haven't had a chance to play it yet.

56
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:31,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but it turns out that we're actually going to be playing that more regularly on our new Xbox 360 Elite system.

57
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it because it's black.

58
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:37,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And I took a picture of it and put it on my MySpace.

59
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:39,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you go black, you never go back.

60
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:40,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

62
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:44,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you buy the replacement hard drive, which is white.

63
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:51,140
[SPEAKER_05]: My hard drive, I also got a 500 gigabyte external hard drive.

64
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is going to be loaded up with... Not porn.

65
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:57,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that?

66
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: She totally was saying porn.

67
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Not porn.

68
00:04:00,764 --> 00:04:02,625
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see it if you're not in studio.

69
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:04,226
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't even an intentional mistake.

70
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:12,752
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate... Yaoi is still porn, you do realize, right?

71
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:14,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to put Yaoi on it.

72
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:17,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuri is still porn, you do realize, right?

73
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:18,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to put Yuri on it.

74
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:18,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

75
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:24,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna put lots of, you know, doujinshi, though.

76
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick side track, because we're talking about replacement hard drives now.

77
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:29,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you're like a cracking type person.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Could she take, like, a 500 gigabyte hard drive and somehow get it on her Xbox 360?

79
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:33,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.

80
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:36,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to?

81
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:37,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I care?

82
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:38,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

83
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:38,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Extreme porn.

84
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:40,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Because each drive has, like, a special...

85
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Model Number, Serial Number, something.

86
00:04:44,613 --> 00:04:51,299
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a program that you can do it up to the max of 120, and it only works with one type of hard drive.

87
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:51,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

88
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can save like $100 doing it that way.

89
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

90
00:04:56,206 --> 00:05:10,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm telling you, Xbox, Microsoft, Major Nelson, all you people that have some power over at Microsoft, the key to winning the marketplace, the video download marketplace, even though from what I hear you guys are already number one for some type of delivery console.

91
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:10,769
[SPEAKER_02]: But forget it.

92
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:13,209
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be even better, 11 times better.

93
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:14,270
[SPEAKER_05]: How about my gaming week?

94
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn downloads.

95
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn downloads.

96
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,851
[SPEAKER_02]: What, your gaming week was porn downloads?

97
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,211
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Rob, I wasn't finished.

98
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:21,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, all right, go ahead.

99
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:27,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I, um, found out from Heather that one of my birthday presents, which she got me, is a paid account for Guild Wars.

100
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:28,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I'll be playing more Guild Wars.

101
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:35,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she tricked you, because you know that Guild Wars, all you have to do is buy the game, and there's no... I know, but I only had a trial.

102
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:36,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, okay.

103
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:42,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I, because I never, you know, bothered buying it, she just gave me the trial and I played it.

104
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:43,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's cool.

105
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:43,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

106
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:48,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to play, so Guild Wars will be what, like your seventh MMO you've actually played?

107
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:51,693
[SPEAKER_05]: in 10 years, yeah.

108
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:52,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

109
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:56,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, I did spend, you know, at least the first seven of it on Ragnarok Online.

110
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:57,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

111
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:58,015
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

112
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:58,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

113
00:05:58,695 --> 00:05:59,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

114
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:00,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Rob.

115
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:00,836
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure?

116
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:02,717
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure you're sure?

117
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,638
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I peed at you in a second.

118
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

119
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,401
[SPEAKER_03]: All I played was Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Earth Defense Force 2017.

120
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.

121
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:15,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it?

122
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:17,323
[SPEAKER_03]: But I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017.

123
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:17,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I've finished...

124
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Normal and easy.

125
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:22,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Working through hard.

126
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing some of the Inferno levels to get more weapons.

127
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:27,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Although that hasn't been going too well.

128
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:29,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And then... I don't know.

129
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:32,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty soon we're going to start playing some more Crackdown.

130
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're going to land two systems at work.

131
00:06:36,011 --> 00:07:04,697
[SPEAKER_03]: and get another copy of that and then that'll be fun so for some co-op and hopefully have a nice setup once Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out and since Saints Row just dropped in price we may pick up some of those to do some multiplayer maybe I swear the only place I've ever even heard of Earth Defense Force is through like podcasts like you I never had heard of this game anywhere on the internet or nothing I gotta get my PlayStation 2 back from my sister because I've got Earth Defense Force 2

132
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Stored neatly on the hard drive.

133
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:11,082
[SPEAKER_03]: But that game actually looks better than this one.

134
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:13,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think this is just a remake of the first one.

135
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:15,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that game really good?

136
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:17,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to buy it, but I don't know.

137
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,315
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so cheesy and stupid, but it's fun.

138
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:22,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

139
00:07:22,377 --> 00:07:22,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

140
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:25,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our chat room seems to think that it's a good game.

141
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:29,166
[SPEAKER_02]: We have SSJ100Matt says, Earth Defense Force equals next-gen body harvest.

142
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:32,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Deekman says, Earth Defense Force 2017 equals awesome.

143
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,388
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, is Loki on whoever's doing EDF's payroll?

144
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,008
[SPEAKER_03]: D3?

145
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:38,428
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

146
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:40,929
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not on their payroll.

147
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:46,930
[SPEAKER_03]: If they want to send me some of the sequels or anything else that they're putting out in the Simple Series in the U.S., hell yeah, I'll take them.

148
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:48,851
[SPEAKER_01]: They can thank you by translating more of them.

149
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:57,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, their next game that's coming out is about this chick that's in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies off with a samurai sword.

150
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:00,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... I want that game.

151
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:01,693
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that sound?

152
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:02,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Did somebody get a boner?

153
00:08:02,874 --> 00:08:03,675
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that noise?

154
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:05,396
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was trying to pick up the mic and hit the boner.

155
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,017
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a boner?

156
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:08,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Rob.

157
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:10,100
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the only one in the room with a laptop on her lap.

158
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a badly timed clink noise.

159
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:16,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up, I'm eating my chicken.

160
00:08:19,195 --> 00:08:20,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Better Than Eating Your Fish.

161
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:30,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they do put out a sequel, though, because if they remake the second one, or even just do a new one that's, you know, got some better enemies in it and stuff, hell, you could just do the same damn storyline.

162
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter, because there really is no storyline.

163
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just blowing shit up.

164
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:35,526
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

165
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:41,050
[SPEAKER_03]: You can level the entire city and just come back to the next level, or if you play the level over again.

166
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't they just have a game called Blow Shit Up?

167
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,514
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a gun in there called the Genocide Gun.

168
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:47,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that that Hulk game?

169
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:49,313
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

170
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:49,893
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

171
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,674
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was Ultimate Destruction.

172
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:54,995
[SPEAKER_02]: They need a game called Blow Shit Up, the game.

173
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:58,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Press A button, blow shit up.

174
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would sell trillions of copies.

175
00:09:01,217 --> 00:09:02,358
[SPEAKER_01]: WarioWare Genocide.

176
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:04,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's pretty much Earth Defense Force.

177
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because that's all you're doing.

178
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mission is like, okay, we need to destroy the ants.

179
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now we need to destroy the robots.

180
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now we need to destroy the robots and the ants.

181
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: That's every level.

182
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:16,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no rescuing, no nothing.

183
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:17,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

184
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a different location.

185
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:19,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's blow shit up.

186
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,732
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a different location.

187
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:21,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's blow shit up.

188
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's a giant thing.

189
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:23,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow it up.

190
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, oh, we can't blow it up.

191
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:26,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Run.

192
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:27,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's it.

193
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, like I said, you can level everything.

194
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Blaze says it's called Rampage, Rob.

195
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:33,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

196
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:37,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Rampage is like one of the most monotonous fucking games ever made, though.

197
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so boring.

198
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:46,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, like, I realize a lot of people have this real fondness for the Rampage series because of the fact, you know, like, hee-hee, you can play monsters and eat people and stuff, but

199
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:51,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, the gameplay is like the most monotonous freaking gameplay I've ever played.

200
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And they keep cranking out sequels, as if I'm interested.

201
00:09:56,745 --> 00:09:57,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like SNK.

202
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:02,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Metal Slug, shut up!

203
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I like Samurai Shodown.

204
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:07,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for your gaming week, Mr. Loki?

205
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:14,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice City Stories, I'm still playing that, and it's still fun, multiplayer.

206
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:14,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love it.

207
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:19,739
[SPEAKER_03]: They better not make Grand Theft Auto 4 anything like Vice City Stories.

208
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Because goddamn, the multiplayer is so fucking glitchy.

209
00:10:23,502 --> 00:10:26,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing the other day, and my car wasn't visible.

210
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:30,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It was visible on my screen, but everybody else just saw me sitting down and floating through the air.

211
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:32,689
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome, actually.

212
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:33,950
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, it's ridiculous.

213
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:41,336
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of stuff that we've just coined terms for, like lawn dart syndrome, where the car will just stick into the ground at a weird angle.

214
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:46,154
[SPEAKER_03]: or like Fat Air where your kernel just stops like it hits something but there's nothing there.

215
00:10:47,154 --> 00:10:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird stuff.

216
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,575
[SPEAKER_03]: We could write a book about this crap.

217
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:53,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well I'm looking at that chat room at chat.orangelandreda.com.

218
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:57,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember we do tape live on Sunday nights and solicit your feedback here in chat.

219
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:58,940
[SPEAKER_02]: DDRDollarBill agrees with me.

220
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Rampage is nice for the first 10 levels and after that ZZZZZ.

221
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:03,842
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no ending.

222
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:04,802
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

223
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a game on Nintendo that was like that.

224
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:09,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only interesting for two levels.

225
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Mag Max.

226
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad Max?

227
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:14,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Mag Max.

228
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Mag Max.

229
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you meant Mad Max, like the Mel Gibson Australia.

230
00:11:18,116 --> 00:11:18,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

231
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:18,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Mag Max.

232
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:19,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Mag Max.

233
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:20,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never even heard of that.

234
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:28,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a really crappy game that every time I'd go visit my dad in the summer, my little sister had it, and I'd get ripped into playing it, and I'd be like, wow, this game sucks.

235
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:32,469
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some pretty god-awful NES games.

236
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:35,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Mad Max was one, too.

237
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:39,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, my friend and I sat around for like two hours once playing Bible Stories.

238
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:42,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are hardcore.

239
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:45,824
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to beat the level with the sheep, and we couldn't do it.

240
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:51,386
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this game I rented once, and I still remember the name to this day.

241
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:52,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't laugh, okay?

242
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,107
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Color Dreams game.

243
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with that, okay?

244
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:59,727
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Color Dreams game was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who.

245
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the most god-awful side-scroller games I've ever played in my entire freaking life.

246
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:09,611
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a reason why Color Dreams was not allowed to use the regular NES shells, okay?

247
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one time when...

248
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember how old I was when I rented one of the Color Dreams games.

249
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I want to rent that because it's blue.

250
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because it's good.

251
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:24,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because, you know, I'm like, hey, it's a blue cartridge.

252
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,143
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be cool.

253
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:25,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

254
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:35,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you think, like, putting that in your Nintendo Entertainment System would somehow, like, unlock the secret mystery of the Pharaoh Tomb from your, like, having the blue cartridge?

255
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:37,889
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just, all that happened was it sucked really bad.

256
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember what game it was.

257
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Some generic side-scroller that just looked like crap.

258
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:44,484
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anyway, sorry.

259
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:45,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the present.

260
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: But my favorite, though, about the Nintendo system is Ikari Warriors and stuff like that, and how the game would get dust on it and would glitch out.

261
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:59,117
[SPEAKER_03]: And all you would do is put your fingers on there and get some more prints on there, and it'd glitch out different ways.

262
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:02,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't know, a plethora of glitching out.

263
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were talking to the glitch.

264
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:04,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, like...

265
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:10,598
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our characters, when we were playing two-player co-op, would be running under everything.

266
00:13:11,118 --> 00:13:18,781
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't actually be running on the layer above where the enemies are, but you could throw stuff and shoot, but he was running under the world, almost.

267
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:27,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I used to like to do is on the Super Nintendo, I would stay up really late all night and pick game genie codes, and then edit them until I came out with interesting results.

268
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:32,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I ran around with, I called him Frog Mario, because he would screen.

269
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that Luigi?

270
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,836
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he was green in the face.

271
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:37,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

272
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Either that or he was like morning stars.

273
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,120
[SPEAKER_05]: He was green in the face.

274
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold your breath, Mario.

275
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep holding it.

276
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:45,722
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't let up.

277
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:52,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And like the pillar effect where the cloud pixels will just expand across the screen.

278
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:54,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really weird.

279
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,350
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

280
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for your Gaming Week, Loki?

281
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the present?

282
00:13:59,713 --> 00:13:59,833
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

283
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:00,313
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

284
00:14:00,812 --> 00:14:15,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go, speaking of a game that hasn't really changed much in the past like 10 years, I bought Pokemon Pearl, I got suckered into buying Pokemon Pearl for the DS, because my friend Miklatov, he's been on the show plenty of times, you guys know who he is, he got Pokemon Diamond the day it came out, and he's like,

285
00:14:15,464 --> 00:14:16,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you want to get Pokemon Pearl, don't you?

286
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:17,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want to get Pokemon Pearl?

287
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:18,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

288
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:19,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

289
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:20,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got voice chat!

290
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:21,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

291
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We can play over the internet!

292
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:23,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on!

293
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:26,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, I succumbed and I got Pokemon Pearl.

294
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:29,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do voice chat over the internet, which is actually kind of cool.

295
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:30,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually works pretty well.

296
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing is that Pokemon hasn't freaking changed since the old school Game Boy versions of it, like, what, 12 years ago, whenever the first ones came out?

297
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Those games have not changed at all.

298
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:52,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, yeah, sure, in this DS one, now you have the little clock at the bottom and you can tap it and have, what, the step count meter and the, you know, thing that shows all your Pokemon at once, whatever.

299
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:56,150
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially the battle system is the same freaking thing.

300
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:06,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Pokemon still make those, like, 8-bit noises that sound like, you know, instead of Pikachu going like, Pikachu, like he does in the cartoon, he goes, it's like the sounds they all make.

301
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:07,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

302
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:09,816
[SPEAKER_02]: They all make these horrendous little blips and blops.

303
00:15:09,836 --> 00:15:14,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sure, the TV is a huge screen, but to get the Pokemon to fit in the little handhelds, they have to just mash them in there.

304
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:14,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess so.

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,201
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no room for them.

306
00:15:17,623 --> 00:15:22,887
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be angry, too, making that noise if you had to get stuck into a little handheld system.

307
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:24,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what some of the Pokemon make.

308
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:27,871
[SPEAKER_02]: They make these god-awful noises.

309
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:29,713
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pissed about you sticking them in those balls.

310
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:33,136
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like, here, no air, no food, no water.

311
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:34,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Now fight for me.

312
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:36,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, you little bitch.

313
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:36,993
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with you?

314
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:40,455
[SPEAKER_01]: He said there, Shut up and fight.

315
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,336
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't fight, you go back in the ball.

316
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No ball, no ball.

317
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:50,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, about Pokemon is that the Pokemon don't die.

318
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:53,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Because no one dies in the Pokemon universe, they simply faint.

319
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:54,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

320
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:56,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow me with this, okay?

321
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,386
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to go on a weird tangent.

322
00:15:58,406 --> 00:15:58,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

323
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:04,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm seeing, you know, we could take bum fights and almost, you know...

324
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:07,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Evolve it into Pokemon.

325
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:13,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, if you think about it, you're basically capturing these, like, homeless creatures and shoving them into a ball.

326
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:15,190
[SPEAKER_01]: That attack you in the wild.

327
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that attack you in the wild.

328
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Stick them in a cardboard box.

329
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: All we need to do now is get cages for the homeless, you know, capture them, you gotta get them all, and get them to fight each other.

330
00:16:25,337 --> 00:16:28,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Nintendo can put it out and everybody be, you know, accepting of it.

331
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the game will probably have friend codes or some shit that'll screw it up.

332
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:43,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow, but Pokemon, okay, yeah, even though it's essentially the same core game that it's been for the past 12 years, I don't know, something feels kind of fun about playing it on the DS, and it's, it's, it's fun.

333
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a good time with it.

334
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:48,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do they tack on, like, this weird, like, advanced stuff?

335
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:53,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, let's add voiceover IP chat to Pokemon.

336
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, why?

337
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, nobody's just, like, saying, uh...

338
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I'm going to add GPS to Metroid.

339
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:03,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just, why do we need that?

340
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:04,777
[SPEAKER_01]: That would actually be really cool.

341
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:17,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually kind of cool because now I kind of use it as a phone, but it's kind of a pain to set it up because you basically have to be chatting with whoever you want to trade with or whatever on instant messenger.

342
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:23,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, sign on to the Wi-Fi now, and then I can go, okay, I'll sign on to the Wi-Fi as well.

343
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you set it up.

344
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:28,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't just go on to the Wi-Fi and blindly hope somebody's going to be on.

345
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:32,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not like Xbox where you're always connected to,

346
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:35,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo doesn't want to make it easy.

347
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:36,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the fun in that?

348
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:54,111
[SPEAKER_02]: These crap Pokemon for really good Pokemon, because I guess the Japanese folks who've had the game for a while kind of don't care.

349
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:59,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I was reading some article on the internet that they want English names, like it's cool to have English names, I guess.

350
00:18:00,435 --> 00:18:07,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want my Pokemon, because I named my Pokemon really dumb stuff, like I think I named my Bidoof, is that the name of the Pokemon?

351
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I named him Muffins.

352
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:11,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And I named them all cute things.

353
00:18:13,444 --> 00:18:15,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Muffins and Sparkles, I have one called Sparkles.

354
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:18,827
[SPEAKER_02]: and FancyPants is one that my friend has.

355
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:23,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, if that's really what's cool to have a Pokemon named Muffins, then go for it, I guess.

356
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:26,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's something I've been playing.

357
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,774
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also been playing Pinball FX, which is a brand new Xbox Live Arcade download.

358
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:33,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played it a lot, but it's Pinball on Xbox Live.

359
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:34,437
[SPEAKER_02]: It's epic Pinball.

360
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't really care for any of the tables, that was my problem with it, I didn't like the tables, but the physics and everything else of the game, I mean, is really good, and, you know, it's got a lot of, you can change all the views, and it definitely feels realistic, you know, multiplayer, and they definitely built it to be expandable, like, they're gonna have new tables for download later on, let's just see how much they're gonna charge us for them, hopefully it's not too bad, but...

361
00:18:57,563 --> 00:18:58,244
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see.

362
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have more to say on Pinball FX in later weeks.

363
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:02,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I've just been playing World of Warcraft a lot.

364
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:07,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Because since I was gone pretty much all last week, I had Rest Bar for like a level and a half.

365
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's Arathi Basin weekend, so I'm trying to get my new gear from Arathi Basin.

366
00:19:13,974 --> 00:19:15,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.

367
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:17,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Warrior Bob, how was your gaming week?

368
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,098
[SPEAKER_01]: My gaming week was pitiful.

369
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:22,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working a lot, so I tried to fit in games where I could.

370
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Tried to play Frequency, but

371
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:29,392
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on a blue PS2 CD, and my drive is dying and can't play those.

372
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,174
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, okay, that sucks, let's go play Sylphid.

373
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:34,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to play Sylphid, oh, that's on a blue disc too.

374
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,339
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, okay, screw this.

375
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:43,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went over to my new Commodore, and I tried to get the copy of Impossible Mission I was given to work.

376
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:44,166
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't work either.

377
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, screw it, and went back to Guitar Hero.

378
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,791
[SPEAKER_01]: So boring.

379
00:19:50,646 --> 00:19:53,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so you were going to get Impossible Mission on Commodore 64?

380
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:55,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I bought a Commodore 64 a couple weeks ago.

381
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,313
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you wrote in the email talking about how you went to the thing.

382
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:00,854
[SPEAKER_02]: But you haven't gotten anything to work on it.

383
00:20:00,874 --> 00:20:03,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've gotten, oh, what game did I get to work on that?

384
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:09,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I got The Hobbit to work on it, which is, well, it's a text adventure and I didn't really have the time to put in for one.

385
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:12,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted an action game, although I did go on GameTap.

386
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:12,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I take it back.

387
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:17,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I went on GameTap, which I downloaded on a whim recently and played that Commodore breakdancing game.

388
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Break-in or whatever it's called.

389
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:20,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you played that thing?

390
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:21,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I did for a little bit.

391
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:22,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Simon says, play DDR.

392
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:27,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like DDR on the Commodore 64 meets like Bust a Crap.

393
00:20:28,414 --> 00:20:29,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that game was.

394
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:30,837
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was so terrible.

395
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:31,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Bust a Crap.

396
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:32,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So bad.

397
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:33,340
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was my gaming week.

398
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly Guitar Hero and yeah, Guitar Hero.

399
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:37,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, very cool.

400
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:42,788
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, getting into some other stuff before we get into tonight's gaming news.

401
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:46,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to say sorry that we missed last week.

402
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,831
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Jamie and I were on vacation, and even before we went on vacation, I was out of town for most of the week.

403
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:55,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were so behind on gaming news that it would have been kind of hard for us to do a show.

404
00:20:55,732 --> 00:21:00,254
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really actually didn't even get home from the trip until like 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night.

405
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:02,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember, but it was really late when we got back.

406
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:07,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do wanted to say a big, big thank you to OLR listener Peter.

407
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:16,575
[SPEAKER_02]: at Disneyland for giving us the fat hookup while we were there because Peter's been listening to the show and knows that Jamie and I are a little bit of Disney freaks.

408
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:17,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

409
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:21,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that was really cool of Peter to meet us there and give us the hookup and all that stuff.

410
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:22,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks, dude.

411
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope to see you again.

412
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:33,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll hopefully maybe in future weeks give the OLR listeners a little more warning when we're going to Disneyland next time and maybe do a little meetup there or something because that would be fun.

413
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We could all ride pirates together.

414
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:36,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yo-ho, yo-ho

415
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,824
[SPEAKER_02]: They have Jack Sparrow in it, which of course gives everybody this big fangasm.

416
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:07,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it changed for the better.

417
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:10,390
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two series of changes before this, I think.

418
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,072
[SPEAKER_05]: They tried to make the write-all PC.

419
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:13,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the politically correct version.

420
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:17,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people bitched, so they tried to ease it through.

421
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:29,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know, okay, do you remember where the glutton pirate was sitting down by the barrel, and this girl would come out of it and say, you know, he wanted the girl too, and she was hiding in the barrel behind him.

422
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they changed it to something else, like she had something, and then now it's Jack Sparrow hiding in the barrel.

423
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,867
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like at the end when he's there singing.

424
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:41,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I like that too, where they have Johnny Depp at the end singing or whatever.

425
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't call him Jack Sparrow, I call him Johnny Depp, just because.

426
00:22:44,372 --> 00:22:45,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

427
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to see the changes that they made to Haunted Mansion.

428
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:51,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I finally rode Haunted Mansion for the first time in like ten years.

429
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,769
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't get to see it with the old bride's attic.

430
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:58,209
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was so long ago when I rode it when I was eight.

431
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob had to be escorted off the ride.

432
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, when I was eight years old, I had to be escorted off the ride because I screamed my head off because the beginning is so freaking scary to that ride.

433
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,452
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no windows and no doors.

434
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:10,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like...

435
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,175
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

436
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:45,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

437
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:47,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Like seven days for the price of four at a discount.

438
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:48,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven days.

439
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:32,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Run the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Phantom Manor Which is a Disney version of the Haunted Mansion Which is actually cooler than ours And also they had Thunder Mountain Railroad And you can actually kind of run those I actually played the Phantom Manor one And that was kind of fun It looks very similar to like I guess what you would actually see if you were operating the ride By the way, all the rides go faster at night

440
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, in this simulator, do the rides go faster at night?

441
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:36,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

442
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:37,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

443
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:41,599
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually is our in-joke, but it's really true on a lot of the rides.

444
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's totally true.

445
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:45,222
[SPEAKER_02]: The rides do go faster at night.

446
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:46,983
[SPEAKER_05]: The teacups go really fast at night.

447
00:24:47,043 --> 00:24:50,667
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, look, we've got to save this for another podcast, so we need to get into some gaming news.

448
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:56,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we did miss last week, Loki's going to fill us in on some of the gaming news that we missed last week since we didn't have a show.

449
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:57,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, kids.

450
00:24:57,653 --> 00:24:57,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

451
00:24:58,794 --> 00:24:59,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, real quick.

452
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things that were getting updated, a few systems.

453
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:12,668
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the 360 got another backwards compatibility update, including some wonderful games being added to it, like Mercenaries.

454
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:17,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, I believe they also had Panzer Dragoon Orta in there.

455
00:25:19,533 --> 00:25:21,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Return to Castle Wolfenstein, I guess, is pretty cool.

456
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:25,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And Street Fighter Anniversary Collection, Soul Calibur II.

457
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:29,168
[SPEAKER_03]: and... let's see here.

458
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:30,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is kind of neat.

459
00:25:30,548 --> 00:25:31,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Guilty Gear Isuka.

460
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So, lots of fun stuff there.

461
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:37,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh, Jet Set Radio Future.

462
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:38,031
[SPEAKER_03]: How could I forget that?

463
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:43,013
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT are now both on the list, but the combo disc is not on the list.

464
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:44,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Riddle me that one.

465
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:47,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It might work, though.

466
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,215
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.

467
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:48,755
[SPEAKER_01]: People tried it.

468
00:25:49,136 --> 00:25:49,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

469
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:50,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then, that sucks.

470
00:25:50,736 --> 00:25:50,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

471
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:52,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Way to do your research, Loki.

472
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:54,238
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on our own forums.

473
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:55,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

474
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:55,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.

475
00:25:56,314 --> 00:26:22,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, another thing, or another system that's getting an update, actually, the PlayStation 3, and they went to firmware 1.7, and that allows you now to be able to play PlayStation 1 games on the PlayStation 3, because there was all those PlayStation 1 games previously that were only available for the PSP, but you had to have a, you know, PS3 to download them, which is retarded in itself, but now you can actually use that to play those games, so, hooray.

476
00:26:22,835 --> 00:26:22,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

477
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:34,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that's possibly going to happen pretty soon here is Neo Geo games have been confirmed to be coming to the virtual console.

478
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:44,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Originally, they thought the first couple games would be Metal Slug and King of Fighters, but right now it hasn't been determined yet what will be available and when.

479
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:47,105
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are coming, so that's good.

480
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, this was also interesting, Konami...

481
00:26:53,052 --> 00:27:00,153
[SPEAKER_03]: has decided to close its Redwood City office and move everything to the LA offices.

482
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:04,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So no more Northern California Gamers Day, unfortunately.

483
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:14,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is kind of interesting because DarkSakura and I actually were at that Konami office for just a little bit last week on our way to Disneyland, which is the first time I'd actually been there.

484
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:16,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a really nice area, though.

485
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:19,497
[SPEAKER_02]: That business complex area, it's with the river going through and everything.

486
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:22,838
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably having to move because rent's really big over there.

487
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:23,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't doubt it.

488
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:25,399
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Bay Area.

489
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple more things I want to add here real quick.

490
00:27:28,841 --> 00:27:32,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Just real quick mentions, Typing of the Dead 2 has been announced.

491
00:27:32,324 --> 00:27:32,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

492
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:36,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the House of the Dead 3 engine, so that's kind of exciting.

493
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:49,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you're a fan of Pac-Man, they're going to be holding the Xbox 360 Pac-Man World Championships, in which you'll be able to be crowned, I guess, the Pac-Man World Champion.

494
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:51,505
[SPEAKER_03]: and receive a custom... Yippee!

495
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:52,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, here's the prizes.

496
00:27:52,746 --> 00:28:09,300
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll receive a custom Pac-Man 360, 100,000 Microsoft points, which on Kotaku they joke is good for a couple Guitar Hero 2 songs, and 26 years of one free Quiznos subs a week.

497
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:18,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then apparently... Wait, 26 years of a free Quiznos sub a week?

498
00:28:18,548 --> 00:28:18,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

499
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:22,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knew Pac-Man was so wealthy?

500
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:23,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like my dinner.

501
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to enter the Pac-Man contest, DarkSakura?

502
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:44,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.

503
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:45,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck at Pac-Man.

504
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:52,084
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in joining, go to XboxLiveTournament.com to register.

505
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:54,184
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

506
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:56,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well thank you for the wrap-up on last week's news.

507
00:28:56,825 --> 00:29:00,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very much appreciated, since we were too lazy to do a show last week.

508
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:01,567
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you.

509
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:06,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, now let's go ahead and get into some gaming news from this week.

510
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:07,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Making things current.

511
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:11,296
[SPEAKER_05]: and this week's news, I was awesome, as usual.

512
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:11,777
[SPEAKER_05]: No, really.

513
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,500
[SPEAKER_02]: April fools!

514
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob, shut up.

515
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:16,883
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost May.

516
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:17,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

517
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:22,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in response to the demand for...

518
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:31,125
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii, Nintendo has promised to increase production so that they can meet the demand that's out there for it.

519
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:42,128
[SPEAKER_05]: They said that they were producing 1 million units per month and are going to be increasing their manufacturing capacity so they can ship 14 million in the next fiscal year.

520
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:43,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

521
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:44,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii!

522
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you might actually be able to find one, correct?

523
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:53,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so far to date, 5.84 million Wii units have been sold so far.

524
00:29:53,907 --> 00:29:54,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang.

525
00:29:55,508 --> 00:29:59,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, actually, didn't they say that by the new year they were going to have 4 million out?

526
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:01,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

527
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:06,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many numbers with these sales things, and then they always change, especially over at the Sony camp.

528
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:08,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, we're going to have a million out by the end of the year.

529
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:09,679
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to eat crayons.

530
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:10,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Shipped.

531
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Shipped.

532
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, shipped.

533
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:13,722
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we meant shipped.

534
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Shipped.

535
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:17,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we say by the end of the year?

536
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,031
[SPEAKER_02]: We meant by the end of April.

537
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:20,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We meant ten boxes put together in the shape of a ship.

538
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,276
[SPEAKER_04]: We said year, we meant fiscal year.

539
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,558
[SPEAKER_02]: We said year, we meant fiscal year.

540
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:26,220
[SPEAKER_02]: The new year doesn't start until we say it does.

541
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,522
[SPEAKER_02]: We use the lunar calendar.

542
00:30:28,351 --> 00:30:31,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't follow all this stupid, you know, goals and sales stuff.

543
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:46,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I just find it very odd that they're just now announcing that they need to ramp up production, seeing as we've been sold out of the Wii for months now, and it's just very convenient that it happened after their fiscal year ended and all that stuff, and now there's Wiis available?

544
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:49,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like that they were stockpiling them or anything?

545
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, yeah.

546
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they're ramping up production.

547
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:55,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's really what's going on.

548
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Conspiracy theories abound here at Orange Lounge Radio.

549
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:02,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing that's also a conspiracy is where the hell are the games?

550
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:13,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had Super Paper Mario came out recently, and, um, well, Kororimpa, I guess?

551
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:18,437
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there was WarioWare and Wii Play.

552
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:22,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Like four months ago, but what's come out in like the past month?

553
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot.

554
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Play, I'm sure, didn't take much to, you know,

555
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:26,800
[SPEAKER_03]: E3 Tech Demos

556
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:50,435
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 of them are in development for the Wii, 79 in development for the DS.

557
00:31:50,495 --> 00:31:53,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might be going, well, you know, why is the DS getting all the love?

558
00:31:53,296 --> 00:31:56,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because there's like, what, like 20 million DSs out there?

559
00:31:56,917 --> 00:32:01,459
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, you know, it's a very big platform to be developing for.

560
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:05,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, 45 games just being developed, not being released this year.

561
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:10,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who knows, because here's a short list of some of the games being developed.

562
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:12,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Smash Bros.

563
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:22,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl, The Legend of Zelda on the DS, Phantom Hourglass, Chibi Robo Park Patrol on the DS, Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii, Metroid and all that fun stuff.

564
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:25,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Hammer and all those other crappy games.

565
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:27,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Six Sight Truck 2.

566
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:30,351
[SPEAKER_01]: All those games you just mentioned were big A-list titles.

567
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:32,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many other A-list titles are there?

568
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:34,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

569
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:39,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going to say because Nintendo is known for only putting out one, two really big name games a year.

570
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:42,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they've got 40 games in development for the Wii for the next four years.

571
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:47,092
[SPEAKER_02]: But also that's them that they have in development too.

572
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:49,634
[SPEAKER_02]: All those games are what Nintendo has in-house developing.

573
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Party 8 and so on and so on.

574
00:32:52,396 --> 00:33:00,161
[SPEAKER_02]: But outside, that's not counting what Konami's got in development, what Capcom's got in development and the third party stuff.

575
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully they keep some good stuff coming too.

576
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:29,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Cooking Mama 2 Revenge of the Horrible Translation Stop porting DS games to the Wii It's just like stop porting Game Boy Advance games to the DS Next thing you know we'll have Game Boy Advance games coming to the Wii Sephiroth 1215 in our chatroom chat.orangeonsradio.com reminds us of another story that came up this week I don't think it was on our show roll but Hideo Kojima played Super Smash Bros.

577
00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:30,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl and apparently it's nearly done

578
00:33:31,454 --> 00:33:36,998
[SPEAKER_02]: According to, I think, some podcast where there was an interview with Kojima, he's actually played it, and it's just about done.

579
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:43,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember reading something about he was afraid to punch Mario because, like, you know, Mario's such a legend.

580
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost all respect for him.

581
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:46,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, seriously.

582
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:47,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking game.

583
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:54,111
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes freaking Metal Gear games, you know, shoot people in the face, and then it's like, oh, but I can't punch Mario.

584
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't punch a fat plumber.

585
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:56,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

586
00:33:58,274 --> 00:34:02,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was one of those where he hesitates for a minute and he says, oh, no, I just can't punch Mario.

587
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Five seconds later, die, you little plummy.

588
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he's embellishing a little bit.

589
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,324
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, you know, oh, I hesitated for a second because I couldn't punch him because, you know, I loved Mario growing up.

590
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:17,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But then after I got past that, it was fucking on.

591
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:19,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I owned the crap out of Iwata.

592
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:22,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chat has some awesome ideas for Cooking Mama sequels.

593
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,912
[SPEAKER_02]: TheRobD says, Cooking Mama 2, Mama teaches you poison.

594
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,962
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sakuramax says, Cooking Mama 2, Cooking Drugs.

595
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:36,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Mama's crack house.

596
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:39,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

597
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:40,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama will give you your fix.

598
00:34:42,968 --> 00:34:46,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Win.

599
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:52,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even better, it's like Mama's son or whatever accidentally kills one of his friends or something.

600
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:53,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

601
00:34:54,113 --> 00:34:56,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to chop the body up and put it in the food.

602
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:58,917
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hide that.

603
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:00,640
[SPEAKER_03]: No one will notice.

604
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:02,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho.

605
00:35:03,344 --> 00:35:04,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Turkey surprise.

606
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:14,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently Square Enix has said that there will not be any of their games coming to at least a Japanese virtual console.

607
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:16,325
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what's kind of hinted.

608
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:17,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Lies!

609
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:18,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so too.

610
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:22,289
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that we feel the Japanese market still requires physical media.

611
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Also Final Fantasy Dragon Quest are played by a wide range of users from children to adults.

612
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:32,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So limitations when you consider a problem that we would have with billing systems.

613
00:35:33,374 --> 00:35:33,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Actraiser?

614
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:34,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Actraiser.

615
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:56,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Enix made Actraiser.

616
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:57,268
[SPEAKER_01]: They're Square now.

617
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:59,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's Square Enix.

618
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:00,510
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the Enix in Square Enix.

619
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you mean Square Enix games aren't coming to Virtual Console?

620
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:05,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Actraiser's already there.

621
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:06,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put it this way.

622
00:36:06,435 --> 00:36:07,796
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you mean it's not in the U.S.?

623
00:36:07,836 --> 00:36:09,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a cartridge of that not long ago.

624
00:36:09,857 --> 00:36:10,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way, okay?

625
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:18,224
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, this is coming originally from an IGN interview with a Square Enix representative.

626
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,587
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually from, I guess, a magazine, Nintendo Dream or something like that.

627
00:36:23,425 --> 00:36:33,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure that there's something lost in translation here because I think what they're talking about is digital downloads in Japan that they aren't going to go to a strictly digital download system or whatever.

628
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:57,914
[SPEAKER_02]: and it might make sense that they might not put Final Fantasy 1 or 2 or whatever on the Virtual Console because they're re-releasing them again I was going to say, that's what it is they're not saying they're not going to put their games on Virtual Console they're saying they're not going to put Final Fantasy 2 and 3 and so on on Virtual Console because you stupid Americans will continue to pay $29.99 for the Game Boy Advance versions because they're so awesome, they're so cool

629
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not going to put them on Virtual Console because of that.

630
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:02,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the reason, yeah.

631
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:08,769
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say there is still hope for Illusion of Gaia and Soul Blazers and all those other old school Enix games at least.

632
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:14,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about Chrono Trigger because they'll probably do an advanced version of that at some point.

633
00:37:14,474 --> 00:37:22,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I will bet you money that there will be a PSP version of Chrono Trigger sometime in the near future because they love...

634
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:25,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Releasing, re-releases and stuff.

635
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:26,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something in your database?

636
00:37:26,847 --> 00:37:39,376
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is purely speculation because they're, I mean, what, they're doing Star Ocean, you know, they're supposed to be a new Star Ocean game, which I do believe we did see a little movie for it a couple years ago at E3.

637
00:37:39,436 --> 00:37:48,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have sworn there was, it was just like that, remember that other, there was like another game series that they were teasing too that I haven't seen anything on, like the

638
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:54,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there one year at E3 when you went into the Square Enix movie room and you saw all the movies?

639
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally every single freaking thing they showed was a Final Fantasy game, and then like, oh, and Star Ocean.

640
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it was something like that.

641
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:15,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there's been a trailer, because like I said, there was some other game series that they're doing that's supposed to be mobile, PlayStation 2, and I think maybe PSP or something that they haven't released yet that's going to be coming out.

642
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

643
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:22,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, DDR Dollar Bill says if they do an advanced version of Chrono Trigger, it better be that fucking good.

644
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:25,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be fucking pissed off if they try to fix it and damage it.

645
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:28,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's letting his, uh, fucking thoughts be known there.

646
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:29,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.

647
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:30,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Such overuse of the F word there.

648
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:31,747
[SPEAKER_02]: What, the fuck word?

649
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Rawr!

650
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:34,308
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's because, you know why?

651
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:36,630
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because Chrono Trigger fans are crazy.

652
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:44,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they're rabid about their Chrono Trigger, and like, if you ever try to get in that whole, like, Final Fantasy VI is better than Chrono Trigger debate, it's like, no, it's not!

653
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:47,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have to wonder, he said fix.

654
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:48,928
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly does fix mean?

655
00:38:48,948 --> 00:38:51,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like the translation changes they made in Final Fantasy VII.

656
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:51,970
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.

657
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Code Age was the game that they were teasing and stuff.

658
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:58,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, there's supposed to be three different games in that series.

659
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:01,255
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them, Code Age Commanders, was supposed to be on PlayStation 2.

660
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:04,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe, like, the cell phones had another one.

661
00:39:04,097 --> 00:39:05,798
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like Code Age something.

662
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:09,861
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I don't remember what the other system it was on.

663
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:10,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Code Age.

664
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, where'd it go?

665
00:39:12,963 --> 00:39:13,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw it.

666
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:15,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Code Age Brawls is going to be the wireless one.

667
00:39:17,148 --> 00:39:18,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

668
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:43,966
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the Final Fantasy's and Chrono Triggers of the World, I want my goddamn Super Mario RPG!

669
00:39:44,206 --> 00:39:46,548
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell do I have to do to get this damn game?

670
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:49,470
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to mod your Xbox, which I know you've done, and play it on an emulator.

671
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you paint your Xbox white, and you call it a Wii.

672
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:55,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii.

673
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:57,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, um...

674
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:02,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit of news regarding Tokyo Game Show.

675
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:05,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo actually will be a big participant there.

676
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:13,028
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually the first time since 1996 that Nintendo's having a booth there, so it's a pretty big deal.

677
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:19,471
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's supposed to be this massive, massive booth, so I think that's going to be pretty cool.

678
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:23,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually is in relation to Dragon Quest IX.

679
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:35,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, I see, so Nintendo is always like, oh, we're not gonna go to the Tokyo Game Show, we're not gonna go, but now they have Dragon Quest, they're like, well, we better fucking go, cause, you know, Dragon Quest is, is, you know.

680
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:39,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Square Enix calls the shots, fuckers.

681
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a goddamn Super Mario RPG!

682
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:44,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Get over it!

683
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:47,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Dragon Quest IX on the DS is probably the reason for that.

684
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:53,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki, since we suck and we're not going to E3, you think we ought to save money and go to Tokyo Game Show?

685
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:53,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

686
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,300
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is fun?

687
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:55,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, come on.

688
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,093
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to go to Tokyo?

689
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:56,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be fun?

690
00:40:59,055 --> 00:40:59,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

691
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Because E3 wasn't bad enough.

692
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:04,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go someplace where I don't understand anything.

693
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And he can cosplay.

694
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:08,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at me.

695
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:09,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stupid American foreigner.

696
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:10,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, film him.

697
00:41:10,824 --> 00:41:11,444
[SPEAKER_04]: He crazy.

698
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:12,525
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.

699
00:41:14,006 --> 00:41:16,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like... No.

700
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:19,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

701
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play DDR.

702
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:21,771
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd love that.

703
00:41:21,831 --> 00:41:23,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be on a variety show or something.

704
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:29,002
[SPEAKER_03]: AmericanGuyPagey FatWhiteManPlayingDDR So funny!

705
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:30,623
[SPEAKER_03]: He uncoordinated!

706
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:46,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the Wii and things possibly in development for it, what about a keyboard?

707
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,641
[SPEAKER_02]: The latest Game Informer magazine has a little spiel on a Wii keyboard.

708
00:41:50,661 --> 00:42:01,265
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, quote, Nintendo's development team says that it's considering adding a keyboard peripheral to the system in order to make online surfing easier, but it has not officially announced anything at this time.

709
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:03,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they want to make online surfing easier?

710
00:42:03,786 --> 00:42:06,087
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not making online friend codes easier.

711
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, no, friend codes aren't easy, so...

712
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:11,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what if they put Super Mario RPG in, like, Flash or something?

713
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you could use your browser to play on the Wii.

714
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:14,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the friend code would get to it.

715
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:16,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you'd need a friend code to use the damn keyboard.

716
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:21,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the keyboards will enhance the ability to put in your friend codes faster.

717
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:23,055
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're not getting rid of them.

718
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:28,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my advice to everyone that wants to surf the internet faster on the Wii.

719
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:31,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to your PC and surf it there.

720
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:33,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your PC on your Wii.

721
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:35,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're technically surfing it on your Wii.

722
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:35,998
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

723
00:42:36,018 --> 00:42:36,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Science.

724
00:42:36,818 --> 00:42:37,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Science.

725
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:45,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I guess the Wii is going to get a keyboard, but I don't see the point unless there's, like, games that start supporting it.

726
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:45,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Typing of the Dead!

727
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:47,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

728
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:48,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

729
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,801
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to happen.

730
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:50,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Typing of the Dead!

731
00:42:50,561 --> 00:42:56,644
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great if you had a motion-sensing keyboard, and you could actually aim the keyboard, like, and then press the enter key.

732
00:42:57,004 --> 00:42:58,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to hit people with a keyboard.

733
00:42:58,605 --> 00:42:59,946
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what they could do, I think, though?

734
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:01,887
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be rad.

735
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:03,768
[SPEAKER_05]: They could do the Gun Survivor series.

736
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:06,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, they could.

737
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:06,669
[SPEAKER_05]: On Wii.

738
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:12,551
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I want a Typing of the Dead 2 where I literally have to pick up my keyboard and smack zombies with it.

739
00:43:12,571 --> 00:43:13,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this isn't working!

740
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,474
[SPEAKER_01]: House of the Dead's a light gun game.

741
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:18,315
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the pointers on the Wiimotes already.

742
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:24,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plug your keyboard in, the keyboard guy fills up the guy with a pointer with typing energy or whatever crazy thing they come up with.

743
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:27,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everything you have to plug into the Wiimotes anyways.

744
00:43:27,301 --> 00:43:27,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

745
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:32,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to plug in the classic controller has to be threaded through your Wiimote and all the enhancements.

746
00:43:32,506 --> 00:43:37,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So this keyboard's probably going to have to plug into the Wii Remote so you have this big thing dangling there off your keyboard.

747
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:41,994
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that will stop you from duct taping the Wiimote to the keyboard, so you use that as your light gun pointer while you're typing.

748
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:42,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.

749
00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:46,559
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a keyboard in your lap, you're trying to shift your waist around to point at the different places on the screen.

750
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:47,199
[SPEAKER_05]: You just put it on your head.

751
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Move your head around.

752
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:49,841
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good idea.

753
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:52,344
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that old Atari thing that they had that was controlled by your eyebrows?

754
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:54,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that, Rob?

755
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:55,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

756
00:43:56,414 --> 00:44:04,600
[SPEAKER_05]: They had this Atari controller back in the day that was trying to be like the ESP controller, but really all you did was wiggle your eyebrows and move your nose a certain way.

757
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:09,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to distract you when you were playing E.T.

758
00:44:09,303 --> 00:44:10,063
[SPEAKER_01]: from how bad it was.

759
00:44:11,624 --> 00:44:11,824
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

760
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:13,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to find it.

761
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:21,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Little do the listeners know that DarkSakura's Folgers coffee has been secretly replaced with LSD.

762
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:26,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a real controller with some prototype that never came out anyway.

763
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that you, with your gaming knowledge, would know this, Rob.

764
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:30,141
[SPEAKER_05]: You disappoint me.

765
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,962
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I was playing on Atari 2600?

766
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:34,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Adventure.

767
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:41,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no eye-wiggling or nose-twitching, I-dream-of-genie motions going on in that game.

768
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:45,586
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you were Yellow Block versus squiggly thing called a dragon.

769
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:47,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Mind Link Controller, that was it.

770
00:44:49,332 --> 00:44:51,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave it to the chat room to figure that one out.

771
00:44:51,113 --> 00:44:52,233
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Bewitched Technology.

772
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:54,394
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it wasn't the chat room that came up with that one.

773
00:44:54,434 --> 00:44:55,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it.

774
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:55,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good job.

775
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:57,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm missing the Wikipedia link now.

776
00:44:57,835 --> 00:44:59,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on with your bad Wikipedia self.

777
00:44:59,756 --> 00:45:02,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix that thing with that Amiga lapboard controllers you had to do that.

778
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:03,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know about that one?

779
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:06,518
[SPEAKER_01]: That yoga or the what was it?

780
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:08,759
[SPEAKER_01]: The Zen Guru Master Game?

781
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:16,542
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a plank that you sat on and on either side of it was a switch so if you tilted too far to the left or right you broke your concentration and the game failed you.

782
00:45:17,222 --> 00:45:17,602
[SPEAKER_01]: You were a

783
00:45:18,223 --> 00:45:19,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Disappointed Guru.

784
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:24,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to seriously dig up some of this shit and just play it on the show one night.

785
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these games sound really awful.

786
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:30,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have the most frustrating game challenge.

787
00:45:30,093 --> 00:45:34,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, let's hook up a Sega Activator to that Commodore Breakdance game.

788
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:37,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Sega Activator.

789
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:37,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, me too.

790
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.

791
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Or play anything with the Power Glove.

792
00:45:40,622 --> 00:45:41,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.

793
00:45:43,184 --> 00:45:44,425
[SPEAKER_02]: The Power Glove was a piece of shit.

794
00:45:45,026 --> 00:45:45,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

795
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:46,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um,

796
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:55,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, apparently Time Magazine has nominated Miyamoto for part of the 100 most influential people.

797
00:45:57,413 --> 00:46:10,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Because yeah, he's done a lot of things, including creating Super Mario and Donkey Kong, Zelda, the Wii, all that fun stuff.

798
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:13,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just think they have to do this because it's a new game console.

799
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like they have to nominate Bill Gates and probably Oprah every year and stuff like that.

800
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,889
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is a gimme.

801
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:31,176
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I actually looked at the results the other day, and Miyamoto was, like, number two on this little user poll, because, like, they have the user poll where you can vote for who you believe is the most influential, and I believe he was, like, number two.

802
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:40,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, like, Perez Hilton was number five, so he's doing a really good job beating such influential people like that.

803
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:44,204
[SPEAKER_03]: They should just do the whole Time 100 thing out of the WeVote channel thing.

804
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's more influential?

805
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:48,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple!

806
00:46:51,043 --> 00:46:52,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Or pink, or whatever.

807
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:53,025
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was Paris Hilton.

808
00:46:54,786 --> 00:46:56,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to check the voting channel.

809
00:46:56,768 --> 00:47:02,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't used that channel in a long time, but last time I played it, I remember there was a question, who's going to win American Idol?

810
00:47:02,832 --> 00:47:04,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Melinda Sanjaya.

811
00:47:05,294 --> 00:47:09,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the second American Idol related question that's been on that stupid WeVotes channel.

812
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:10,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating.

813
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,082
[SPEAKER_02]: They still haven't used any of my submissions, which makes me very sad.

814
00:47:17,991 --> 00:47:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I submitted a question that said, which is funnier, clowns or rape?

815
00:47:21,032 --> 00:47:22,893
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I'm just kidding.

816
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:24,073
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I'm going to get so much hate mail.

817
00:47:24,113 --> 00:47:24,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.

818
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:25,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I was drunk, okay?

819
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get hate mail from clowns.

820
00:47:26,935 --> 00:47:28,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to get hate mail from clowns.

821
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:28,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate clowns.

822
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:30,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I was drunk, okay?

823
00:47:30,536 --> 00:47:35,018
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I submitted a serious one that says, which dessert is better, cake or pie?

824
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:38,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that this is something that needs to be asked of the American public.

825
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we need to settle this debate once and for all.

826
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:42,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I swear to God, pie is better.

827
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:47,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We should do one that says, are you damned if you do or damned if you don't?

828
00:47:47,758 --> 00:47:49,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the glass half empty or half full?

829
00:47:50,479 --> 00:47:51,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

830
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy, happy day!

831
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:02,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken Kutaragi, he of the crayon eating, bicycle helmet wearing, you know, leash.

832
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:04,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make more photo shots of that.

833
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:13,486
[SPEAKER_05]: He who sucks so bad has retired from his position with the PlayStation.

834
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:16,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's still the honorary chairman of SCEI.

835
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:26,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So, everyone can let out a collective sigh of relief, except... Guess what happens when you cut off this head.

836
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:31,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Another one has regrown in its place in the form of Kazuo Hirai.

837
00:48:32,905 --> 00:48:33,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Kutaragi's a Hydra?

838
00:48:36,027 --> 00:48:36,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

839
00:48:36,828 --> 00:48:37,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Giant enemy Hydra.

840
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, what's a Nubian?

841
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the fuck up!

842
00:48:44,514 --> 00:48:46,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I'm suddenly reminded of that for some reason.

843
00:48:46,316 --> 00:48:48,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that whole scene.

844
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:50,221
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a Nubian bitch?

845
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,442
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost made me laugh.

846
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:56,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, but fear not!

847
00:48:57,314 --> 00:49:05,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the craziness at Sony is still not over, you know, Ken may be gone, but their PR department's still there to make a complete ass of themselves.

848
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:13,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Including such things as the PlayStation 2 launch party for God of War 2 in the UK.

849
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:19,739
[SPEAKER_03]: They've decided to celebrate this in the non-offensive way at all by offering a decapitated goat...

850
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Pita!

851
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you eat pita today?

852
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:25,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you eat pita earlier?

853
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,284
[SPEAKER_03]: People eating tasty animals.

854
00:49:48,223 --> 00:49:49,404
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

855
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:18,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, apparently the International Fund for Animal Welfare said it was outrageous that the animals' death had to be used to sell a few computer games.

856
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:23,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I dare one of our listeners to email PETA a link to one of these stories.

857
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,830
[SPEAKER_02]: What is their website?

858
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,331
[SPEAKER_02]: PETA2.org or something?

859
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:33,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I once went out with someone who worked for PETA, and man, they're nuts.

860
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,636
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to see what happens when they get a hold of this story, just because...

861
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:39,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

862
00:50:39,376 --> 00:50:40,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick.

863
00:50:40,397 --> 00:50:41,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a problem.

864
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:46,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's a sick side of me that really wants to see what will happen when PETA gets a hold of what's going on here.

865
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:52,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I mean, other than the fact that it is kind of cool, though, that they do have, like, you know, topless chicks there.

866
00:50:53,250 --> 00:51:02,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But what PR guy thought it was a great idea to decapitate a goat at a party and have people eat from its entrails?

867
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:02,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

868
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:06,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're just trying to stay authentic to Roman culture?

869
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, seriously, was some guy like sitting there playing a game or something?

870
00:51:10,422 --> 00:51:12,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I need you to prove this PR event info.

871
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's good, okay.

872
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:16,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to playing God of War 2.

873
00:51:17,727 --> 00:51:18,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I could play the sex minigame.

874
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:22,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was an animatronic goat.

875
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:25,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Not judging by the picture on that article.

876
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:30,896
[SPEAKER_03]: They blurred out the decapitated head that apparently was hanging on by a string still.

877
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:31,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

878
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:31,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

879
00:51:33,931 --> 00:51:37,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like some type of, you know, ancient Roman custom?

880
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:41,174
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to think so.

881
00:51:41,854 --> 00:51:50,938
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say I was reading some thread about this on the internet and someone came out and said, well, actually, you know, I live with a scholar on Greece and no, they didn't do this at all.

882
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:53,519
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got it wrong.

883
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:55,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea if this is true or not.

884
00:51:55,976 --> 00:52:02,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, apparently... Well, dude, I can hear the Sony meeting now when the Angrapedia letters start coming.

885
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:08,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, we read about it on Wikipedia, so it must be true.

886
00:52:08,861 --> 00:52:11,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what do you mean it didn't decapitate goats in Greece?

887
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:13,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on Wikipedia.

888
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

889
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:17,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

890
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of things hanging on by a string, Kutaragi may have some hope left in where he can go next.

891
00:52:23,798 --> 00:52:26,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, true, he's going to be on the board at Sony or whatever.

892
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,304
[SPEAKER_02]: But, very interesting, Satoru Iwata made a very interesting comment.

893
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:34,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Iwata being the president of Nintendo.

894
00:52:34,566 --> 00:52:39,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Iwata stated, quote, they would love to see Kutaragi join up with Nintendo.

895
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:40,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's going to happen.

896
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't that prospect make you excited?

897
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

898
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:20,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the rest of the quote was, we'd love to see Kutaragi join up with Nintendo, and then the rest of the quote was, in the available warehouse position that we have, mailing out the Wii's to Best Buys all over the world.

899
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief Operating Officer of Crayons.

900
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the Janitorial Department.

901
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:26,651
[SPEAKER_01]: You realize the acronym for which is kook.

902
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:32,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so moving forward, how about some news that doesn't involve Kutaragi, please?

903
00:53:32,113 --> 00:53:32,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, kind of.

904
00:53:33,613 --> 00:53:33,853
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

905
00:53:35,065 --> 00:53:38,167
[SPEAKER_05]: The PlayStation Store now has available Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

906
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:42,289
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo is available here in the U.S.

907
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:46,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And also a demo for Virtua Tennis is there.

908
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:47,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty cool.

909
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:55,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Also trailers for Gauntlet 2, The Wheelman, John Woo's Stranglehold, and The Godfather.

910
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:59,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And the full version of Ninja Gaiden Sigma is set for June.

911
00:54:00,743 --> 00:54:06,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you could sum this whole story up by basically saying PlayStation Network actually gets content.

912
00:54:08,025 --> 00:54:08,766
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Tekken.

913
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:10,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

914
00:54:10,306 --> 00:54:10,686
[SPEAKER_02]: There was Tekken.

915
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:11,847
[SPEAKER_03]: That was only back in February.

916
00:54:13,147 --> 00:54:13,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken.

917
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:19,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas Xbox 360, hey, to their credit, has upped it to two arcade titles a week recently.

918
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:22,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, more than some of us can handle.

919
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:25,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

920
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:27,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of stuff coming out soon...

921
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:33,733
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take a look around the world at some various release dates, what's coming up in the near future in some various countries around the world.

922
00:54:34,233 --> 00:54:40,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And during my portion of this segment, I usually talk about what's going on in Japan with the Japanese release dates.

923
00:54:40,498 --> 00:54:41,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, folks?

924
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:42,900
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really not a lot.

925
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:52,468
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some peripherals coming out for the Wii and for the DS, but honestly, game-wise, as far as Japanese release dates go, there's really only like one game coming out.

926
00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:01,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be this game on the Nintendo DS called Osowari Tantai Osowarina, also known as Good Prince.

927
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:07,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an adventure game coming out from... I'm not sure who actually is putting this out.

928
00:55:07,122 --> 00:55:08,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Success is putting this out.

929
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:10,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't look to be based on an anime game.

930
00:55:10,805 --> 00:55:13,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see if there's actually screenshots from the game here.

931
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:19,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks to be... Well, very boring, actually, is what the game looks to be.

932
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:21,914
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are interested in boring games, check that one out.

933
00:55:23,442 --> 00:55:30,787
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it for Japanese release dates there's really nothing coming out this week over there we want more release dates more MORE

934
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's spelled with an A. I don't have one.

935
00:55:35,983 --> 00:55:41,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you can get really excited about Face Cover Portable coming out on the Sony PSP.

936
00:55:41,725 --> 00:55:42,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

937
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:44,045
[SPEAKER_02]: In black, blue, pink, and white.

938
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,886
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite game already.

939
00:55:46,006 --> 00:55:47,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Face Cover Portable?

940
00:55:47,526 --> 00:55:48,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Face Cover Portable.

941
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:53,068
[SPEAKER_01]: You stick the PSP in front of your face and it puts different faces on your face.

942
00:55:53,088 --> 00:55:54,168
[SPEAKER_02]: For a low price of $8.

943
00:55:54,408 --> 00:55:58,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great that they have a face cover in black when the PSP is black.

944
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:00,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a system cover, I get it.

945
00:56:29,116 --> 00:56:29,676
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

946
00:56:47,064 --> 00:56:48,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too much else coming out.

947
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:52,487
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Cube on PSP, which is like a puzzle game.

948
00:56:53,248 --> 00:56:58,591
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ultimate Board Game Collection, which is coming out from... Or it's being distributed through Capcom.

949
00:56:58,611 --> 00:57:02,993
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a... The Ultimate in Board Games!

950
00:57:03,013 --> 00:57:04,234
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a board game collection.

951
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:07,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna fuck you up with some sorry!

952
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:11,918
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't handle all this clue we got up in here!

953
00:57:12,598 --> 00:57:15,020
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's... I think I'll leave it with the...

954
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:18,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best stuff right here.

955
00:57:18,846 --> 00:57:22,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got... This Parcheesi's gonna fuck your shit up!

956
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:27,148
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PC, Fairy Godmother Tycoon is coming out.

957
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again proving that there are way too many tycoon games.

958
00:57:31,809 --> 00:57:32,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Board game tycoon.

959
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:35,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

960
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to joke you at all.

961
00:57:39,591 --> 00:57:41,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I did find the coolest board game today.

962
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:45,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently it's one that's been out for a while and I just didn't know about it.

963
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:45,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Anti-Monopoly.

964
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:45,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Anti-Monopoly.

965
00:57:46,804 --> 00:57:48,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of Anti-Monopoly.

966
00:57:48,105 --> 00:57:50,466
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where when you win the game you lose because the government breaks you up?

967
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:51,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

968
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, how about some UK release dates?

969
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:55,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Shall we?

970
00:57:55,808 --> 00:57:56,948
[SPEAKER_05]: In Anti-Monopoly?

971
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is there a point to owning Baltic Avenue and Mediterranean?

972
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:02,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's good PR.

973
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:02,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

974
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:04,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

975
00:58:05,812 --> 00:58:07,652
[SPEAKER_05]: All these release dates are for the 4th.

976
00:58:07,732 --> 00:58:10,734
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops on PSP.

977
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,995
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Mindy Storm on DS.

978
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:21,548
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Tony Hawk's Project 8 on PSP, Untold Legends, Dark Kingdom on PlayStation 3, and Final Fantasy 3 for the DS.

979
00:58:22,689 --> 00:58:23,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

980
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:25,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 3 is a good one.

981
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:26,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Two good games in that.

982
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about time you folks over in the UK got to check that one out.

983
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:31,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was pretty good.

984
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good stuff.

985
00:58:33,574 --> 00:58:36,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, later on though, they're getting some other really good games, like Mario Strikers.

986
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, SpongeBob!

987
00:58:40,137 --> 00:58:43,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I heard that Strikers really sucks, but you didn't hear that from me.

988
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, how about Picross?

989
00:58:46,432 --> 00:58:47,313
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

990
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:06,281
[SPEAKER_02]: and what's interesting is that the ESRB is showing that this game is not just coming out on the Xbox 360, but it's also coming out on the PlayStation 3.

991
00:59:07,322 --> 00:59:17,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting because you've heard about all these, you know, exclusive games going from the PlayStation 3 over to the Xbox 360, but this is one, you know, I think a lot of people were looking forward to that now seems to have gone the other way.

992
00:59:17,791 --> 00:59:27,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if I recall right, Eternal Sonata was never promised as an exclusive title either way, so it's not like this is like huge, like, OMG, Microsoft got pwned type news, it's just

993
00:59:27,938 --> 00:59:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just, you know, hey, it might be coming out for this other platform as well.

994
00:59:31,879 --> 00:59:36,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, this would be the one that's based all off, what, Chopin's music or something?

995
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:37,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

996
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:39,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's right.

997
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:42,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like an interesting title based on the screenshots.

998
00:59:42,723 --> 00:59:44,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very, like, Final Fantasy-ish.

999
00:59:45,424 --> 00:59:49,565
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like how the characters' names are, like, Polka and Allegretto and all that stuff.

1000
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:50,025
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.

1001
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically about a magical land that when you get terminally...

1002
00:59:57,797 --> 01:00:01,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like that cloud dream.

1003
01:00:01,238 --> 01:00:02,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, so this is Make-A-Wish, the game?

1004
01:00:03,259 --> 01:00:04,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, yes.

1005
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1006
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:20,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, the PlayStation Network is also getting some other interesting games coming out, including a game called Snakeball, which is supposedly the funkiest online sport ever created.

1007
01:00:21,466 --> 01:00:22,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Quotes IGN.

1008
01:00:23,267 --> 01:00:23,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1009
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:28,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So no idea what exactly that's going to be, but I don't know, it looks cute I guess.

1010
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:33,371
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got like a little penguin shy guy thing on there, so that's kind of neat.

1011
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:36,532
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute, except the game is called Snake Ball.

1012
01:00:36,612 --> 01:00:38,772
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just asking for trouble in PR.

1013
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:44,013
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it says... And I believe Snake Ball could be a euphemism for penis.

1014
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:46,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a snake.

1015
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:47,965
[SPEAKER_03]: and Balls.

1016
01:00:48,085 --> 01:00:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Snakeball, you I guess are donning your disco shoes and you glide across a dance floor on a hover snake while collecting colored balls to score points.

1017
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:07,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It says other players can rapidly reduce your point tally by flicking you with their tails or blasting you with their weapons.

1018
01:01:07,669 --> 01:01:13,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it's going to support an option to import your face and map it on to stuff.

1019
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:15,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1020
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks okay.

1021
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:16,871
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat.

1022
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that they're going to be getting is a brand new game called Stardust HD, which I guess is a cross between Asteroids and, I guess, since everybody compares games to this, Geometry Wars.

1023
01:01:34,555 --> 01:01:37,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yet another game where you blow up a lot of shit.

1024
01:01:38,376 --> 01:01:40,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a game is like Geometry Wars if you shoot stuff.

1025
01:01:41,517 --> 01:01:41,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

1026
01:01:42,547 --> 01:01:46,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Hostile1 in our chatroom, chat.orangelongerator.com has a comment on the snake balls game.

1027
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:51,610
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, get these motherfucking snake balls off my motherfucking console.

1028
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

1029
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:54,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Like snakes on a plane.

1030
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:55,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

1031
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:56,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Movie sucked.

1032
01:01:56,152 --> 01:02:07,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I love snakes on a plane, but I really liked it just for the situation I saw it in, where me and Megzy and Chris all had stuffed snakes that we picked up at the Trader across from Indiana Jones and wore them into the theater.

1033
01:02:08,476 --> 01:02:09,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going to say it was an in-flight movie.

1034
01:02:11,037 --> 01:02:11,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been great.

1035
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:12,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I touch you?

1036
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Or will I bleed from your awesomeness?

1037
01:02:17,845 --> 01:02:18,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1038
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:22,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like death!

1039
01:02:23,508 --> 01:02:24,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I got gay from Rob!

1040
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:26,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all over my foot.

1041
01:02:27,971 --> 01:02:28,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1042
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,512
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, the gay foot.

1043
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:32,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Your legacy will be remembered for years.

1044
01:02:32,854 --> 01:02:34,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, DarkTensia said touch DS.

1045
01:02:34,294 --> 01:02:37,656
[SPEAKER_05]: That was funny.

1046
01:02:38,377 --> 01:02:38,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1047
01:02:39,818 --> 01:02:41,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So guess what we have.

1048
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:41,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

1049
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:42,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

1050
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:46,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you just eat that sauce from McDonald's?

1051
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:47,264
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking awesome.

1052
01:02:47,324 --> 01:02:49,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stop.

1053
01:02:49,906 --> 01:02:57,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like touching DarkSakura's foot and I was like hee hee and now I was reaching out and I looked over and I swear I saw Loki like drinking the sauce from McDonald's.

1054
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:59,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I was because it's so tasty.

1055
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:01,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that's nasty.

1056
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:02,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like pure, pure fat.

1057
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:03,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sweet and sour sauce.

1058
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran out of nuggets.

1059
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:07,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway!

1060
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:19,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I gotta know, are you one of those people that bitches at the drive-thru because they're like, okay, if you only get six nuggets, you only get one sweet and sour sauce pack, and if you want more, you gotta pay ten cents extra.

1061
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:25,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get really upset about that because you like to drink them, apparently?

1062
01:03:25,378 --> 01:03:29,160
[SPEAKER_03]: No, two's enough for like a ten-piece nuggets or whatever, but, you know.

1063
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:34,302
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me three, so what the fuck am I supposed to, I can't just save it for next time.

1064
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:35,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it, Rob.

1065
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,801
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a shot for 10 cents.

1066
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:40,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I mean, I take syrup shots.

1067
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:41,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1068
01:03:41,602 --> 01:03:45,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you eat the jams at, like, waffle, country waffles and all that stuff, too?

1069
01:03:45,463 --> 01:03:45,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1070
01:03:45,943 --> 01:03:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like jams.

1071
01:03:46,604 --> 01:03:48,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the syrup shots, though, from Roscoe's?

1072
01:03:49,044 --> 01:03:50,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Nasty, nasty, nasty.

1073
01:03:50,245 --> 01:03:52,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You take syrup shots with everybody, Rob?

1074
01:03:52,465 --> 01:03:53,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to finish drinking this now.

1075
01:03:53,786 --> 01:03:54,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I was drunk!

1076
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:55,986
[SPEAKER_05]: At Roscoe's?

1077
01:03:57,127 --> 01:03:57,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1078
01:03:57,387 --> 01:03:58,487
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my excuse for everything.

1079
01:03:58,627 --> 01:03:59,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fine.

1080
01:03:59,788 --> 01:04:02,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So guess what Sony's giving us, the bastards?

1081
01:04:03,229 --> 01:04:03,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1082
01:04:04,605 --> 01:04:05,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Crabs, AIDS.

1083
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:07,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Hot Shots Tennis.

1084
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:08,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say shots.

1085
01:04:09,207 --> 01:04:12,349
[SPEAKER_05]: You can dress up the little girls in different costumes.

1086
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not very hot.

1087
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:16,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Hot Shots.

1088
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:17,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's supposed to be cute.

1089
01:04:18,252 --> 01:04:18,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yummy.

1090
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:22,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Hot Shots Tennis.

1091
01:04:22,454 --> 01:04:22,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1092
01:04:23,174 --> 01:04:23,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Next.

1093
01:04:26,156 --> 01:04:28,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I love your reporting, DarkSakura.

1094
01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:30,798
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even bother to give us the details.

1095
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:31,999
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just like, yeah, I'm

1096
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:37,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's making a Hot Shots tennis game, and you can dress chicks up, but this game sucks.

1097
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:41,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do that in Dead or Alive, and in this one I get bouncing boobies, so ha.

1098
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:43,417
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1099
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:47,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, E3 is coming to town.

1100
01:04:47,303 --> 01:04:48,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's coming to Santa Monica.

1101
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:51,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Where exactly in town, they haven't really said.

1102
01:04:51,677 --> 01:04:55,239
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, they've kind of like told people like, okay, be on the street corner.

1103
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:57,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, my invitations at the house, I could have looked there.

1104
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, be on the, well, they're going to tell you like, be on the street corner and then like an unmarked bus will come pick you up.

1105
01:05:03,183 --> 01:05:06,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like going to a rave, apparently, is what E3 is tuned into.

1106
01:05:06,665 --> 01:05:11,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, dude, there's going to be like this sweet party at this like vacated airport hangar.

1107
01:05:12,017 --> 01:05:12,497
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1108
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:50,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, Sony's on the list, Microsoft's on the list, and Nintendo's on the list, because all the companies that are debuting stuff is a lot of the big, big companies.

1109
01:05:51,432 --> 01:05:58,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Kensha Hall was where 300 of those 400 companies were last year, but it's still kind of surprising there.

1110
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,242
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't fit that many companies on an unmarked bus.

1111
01:06:01,482 --> 01:06:02,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess not, so...

1112
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:08,559
[SPEAKER_02]: The invitations are down by the way to between 3,000 and 4,000 compared to last year.

1113
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:08,559
60,000!

1114
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:12,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Is one of the companies that's going to have a booth there G4?

1115
01:06:12,861 --> 01:06:14,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know they always have a booth.

1116
01:06:14,622 --> 01:06:16,223
[SPEAKER_02]: No, G4 is not on the exhibitors list.

1117
01:06:16,963 --> 01:06:21,185
[SPEAKER_02]: But they will probably still somehow have like 500 people at E3.

1118
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:23,446
[SPEAKER_02]: All in those ugly shirts.

1119
01:06:25,404 --> 01:06:25,984
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1120
01:06:46,604 --> 01:06:50,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki and I are sitting here going, God damn, motherfucking E3, I'm not fucking sending this invite.

1121
01:06:50,767 --> 01:06:53,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh yeah, I got an invite, just kind of sitting at home.

1122
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:55,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I may not go.

1123
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:59,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually am putting my focus on my education, so maybe.

1124
01:06:59,613 --> 01:07:02,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, if people want to give me money, I'll go.

1125
01:07:02,195 --> 01:07:04,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's kind of expensive to stay down there.

1126
01:07:04,537 --> 01:07:06,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're listening, ESA fuckers.

1127
01:07:07,299 --> 01:07:10,261
[SPEAKER_03]: This is who you're inviting, people that don't want to go.

1128
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say I don't want to go, I can't afford to go.

1129
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:18,718
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is DarkSakura, a.k.a.

1130
01:07:18,738 --> 01:07:21,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie Summers, and I think you should let me into E3.

1131
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really angry about things!

1132
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:26,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me play your game, goddammit!

1133
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:31,205
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, if they would give me a place to stay, then I would be happy.

1134
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:37,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just wear glasses, do my hair in that little A-style that DarkSakura has hers, and I could sneak in as her.

1135
01:07:38,009 --> 01:07:40,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you'd have to... I wanna play your game!

1136
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:41,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it have boobs?

1137
01:07:43,252 --> 01:07:43,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1138
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:45,520
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

1139
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:19,149
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, would you care to start us off with the FUs of the week?

1140
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:23,070
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes... It's very simple.

1141
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes to stupid drama.

1142
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:30,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's fucking raining on me at Disneyland on my birthday!

1143
01:08:31,352 --> 01:08:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, dude, the lines were short.

1144
01:08:33,872 --> 01:08:35,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And the teacups were not being opened.

1145
01:08:35,373 --> 01:08:36,073
[SPEAKER_02]: That was sad.

1146
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:41,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, and, and, and, and... The hundred minute wait is Space Mountain, fuckers!

1147
01:08:43,515 --> 01:08:44,795
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, and, and, and, and...

1148
01:08:45,814 --> 01:08:46,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, done.

1149
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:47,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

1150
01:08:48,855 --> 01:09:03,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, fuck you to the dumbass that ran our games at QZAR last night, because you are a dumb fucking... The job, I mean, because I've done the job, it's not that fucking hard, and somehow you've failed at every aspect of it.

1151
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:09,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, when I was playing in front of him, he was, like, mystified, like I was doing magic or something, you know?

1152
01:09:10,065 --> 01:09:11,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are you doing that?

1153
01:09:12,846 --> 01:09:13,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible.

1154
01:09:13,727 --> 01:09:14,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible.

1155
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:16,512
[SPEAKER_03]: The QZAR has really gone downhill in Vacaville.

1156
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,972
[SPEAKER_03]: All the packs are all fucked up.

1157
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck them for screwing that up.

1158
01:09:22,254 --> 01:09:29,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to give an F you to Loki's wife, Nelly, for shooting me 58 times in one game at said QZAR because the...

1159
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:58,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Dumbass who was running it forgot to turn on the defense shields So she could just shoot me over and over and over and over and over again Which is what she did She just basically held the gun up to my back and kept shooting Because I could not shoot the base Like something was wrong with the base But I had a fun time at laser tag F you to Loki for not opening up his own laser tag arena For being too like I'm gonna go broke Oh wait what's that Oh it's 20 You know 2 million dollars in my ass Wow If only I could do that

1160
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:01,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Get alone or something, I don't know.

1161
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:04,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Rescue us from horrible QZars around the world.

1162
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what else do I have an FU to?

1163
01:10:07,361 --> 01:10:07,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1164
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's it.

1165
01:10:10,523 --> 01:10:11,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an FU to Nelly.

1166
01:10:12,284 --> 01:10:14,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Warrior Bob, any FUs you have to get off your chest?

1167
01:10:14,726 --> 01:10:16,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually a fairly happy guy.

1168
01:10:16,427 --> 01:10:17,508
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a whole lot of FUs.

1169
01:10:17,548 --> 01:10:22,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything, it's to Sony for the drives not reading blue disks, because that makes me angry.

1170
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:27,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Jobs for not being open for me, because I'm unemployed.

1171
01:10:28,794 --> 01:10:29,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Unemployment sucks.

1172
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:30,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on it.

1173
01:10:31,162 --> 01:10:32,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people who are unemployed right now.

1174
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:33,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sucks.

1175
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:34,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, blue discs make me more angry.

1176
01:10:37,425 --> 01:10:40,787
[SPEAKER_02]: You should say an F you to the Rob D for sounding like you.

1177
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:41,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1178
01:10:41,327 --> 01:10:41,887
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of weird.

1179
01:10:42,047 --> 01:10:43,228
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rob D sounds like me?

1180
01:10:43,268 --> 01:10:43,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1181
01:10:43,688 --> 01:10:47,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've ever listened to the This Day in Gaming podcast, but you guys have a very similar voice.

1182
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:48,290
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting.

1183
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:49,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to go listen to that now.

1184
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:49,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1185
01:10:50,471 --> 01:10:51,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

1186
01:10:51,031 --> 01:10:51,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad thing.

1187
01:10:52,092 --> 01:10:54,753
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a great radio voice, and so do you.

1188
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:55,373
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.

1189
01:10:55,513 --> 01:10:57,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I sleep all night, and so I'm totally unconscious.

1190
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:58,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what I'm running around doing.

1191
01:10:58,775 --> 01:10:59,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we're the same guy.

1192
01:11:00,729 --> 01:11:01,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1193
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's in chat right now, though.

1194
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's possible.

1195
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:10,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're like that chick on Heroes who can use the internet with her brain or whatever that is.

1196
01:11:10,277 --> 01:11:11,097
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be so distracting.

1197
01:11:11,157 --> 01:11:12,879
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I am not like the chick on Heroes.

1198
01:11:12,979 --> 01:11:22,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and yeah, that stupid bitch on Heroes fucking A. I sign up for the damn little viral website and she spams me all this shit all the time.

1199
01:11:22,926 --> 01:11:28,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Had I known her secret power was spamming people, I wouldn't have fucking signed up on that goddamn viral site.

1200
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:29,732
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an F you.

1201
01:11:29,892 --> 01:11:32,193
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to freaking Spambots getting into my forums.

1202
01:11:32,633 --> 01:11:35,635
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to PHPBB for making it really hard for me to fix that.

1203
01:11:36,616 --> 01:11:37,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And F you again to Spambots.

1204
01:11:37,697 --> 01:11:38,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Spammer.

1205
01:11:38,117 --> 01:11:41,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing, I hate fucking spam that has to do with the stock market.

1206
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:43,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play the stock market.

1207
01:11:43,561 --> 01:11:47,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck would I care what companies want me to buy?

1208
01:11:47,523 --> 01:11:50,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Amanda sent me the best title, though, from a spam email.

1209
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:51,646
[SPEAKER_05]: You exemplify Carrot.

1210
01:11:53,137 --> 01:11:54,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever happened to Spamusement?

1211
01:11:54,577 --> 01:11:57,238
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like my favorite online... Have there been updates?

1212
01:11:57,258 --> 01:12:01,219
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my favorite online comic anywhere was Spamusement.

1213
01:12:01,419 --> 01:12:03,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just kind of stopped doing updates.

1214
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:09,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I realize maybe the guy, like, you know, real life comes first and maybe he had something else he wanted to do.

1215
01:12:10,001 --> 01:12:11,202
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make me any less sad.

1216
01:12:11,222 --> 01:12:12,402
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just pass it off to somebody.

1217
01:12:12,702 --> 01:12:14,643
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the last one was October 20th.

1218
01:12:15,823 --> 01:12:16,563
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes me sad.

1219
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:19,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, if you've never seen Spamusement, go look in the archives.

1220
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:24,581
[SPEAKER_02]: The Older Cartoons at Spamusement.com It's one of the greatest online comics I've ever read in my life.

1221
01:12:25,623 --> 01:12:26,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

1222
01:12:27,545 --> 01:12:29,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, some of these are kind of gross.

1223
01:12:29,487 --> 01:12:33,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's going to be a brand new phone coming out from Mitsubishi.

1224
01:12:33,913 --> 01:12:35,054
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new Docomo.

1225
01:12:36,656 --> 01:12:37,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like Kokomo.

1226
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:49,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, D904i and apparently it's going to have a motion sensor built into it or I believe there's something about it using its camera to detect motion.

1227
01:12:50,404 --> 01:13:02,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, it's a fucking like Wii phone type thing and you're going to be able to use it to play games and a couple of the games that are going to be coming out for it, of course, Katamari Portable and UR Gundam.

1228
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:05,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess that's neat.

1229
01:13:05,988 --> 01:13:06,188
[SPEAKER_03]: But,

1230
01:13:06,994 --> 01:13:08,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they don't release them in the U.S.

1231
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:14,636
[SPEAKER_03]: because people have enough trouble driving, let alone playing tilty games on their cell phone.

1232
01:13:15,616 --> 01:13:16,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1233
01:13:16,116 --> 01:13:17,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Driving while side-talking.

1234
01:13:18,476 --> 01:13:20,237
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, how about just shut up and drive?

1235
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I vote for.

1236
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:28,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And further proof that Namco intends to just poop all over the Katamari franchise while the creator has gone off to greener pastures.

1237
01:13:28,599 --> 01:13:30,539
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you can roll it up and do an even bigger pump.

1238
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:32,630
[SPEAKER_01]: and set it on fire.

1239
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll it up and light it.

1240
01:13:35,852 --> 01:13:36,612
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

1241
01:13:38,153 --> 01:13:40,274
[SPEAKER_05]: New Katamari game, Katamari Weed.

1242
01:13:41,454 --> 01:13:42,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Katamari Weed.

1243
01:13:42,495 --> 01:13:42,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1244
01:13:43,311 --> 01:14:05,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, that's going to bring Segment A of Orange Lounge Radio to a close here, and we'll be back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio, because as you know, we tape in two... Well, maybe you don't know, because we were gone last week, so maybe you need a little bit of a refresher, but Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two halves, live on Sunday night, and this first half will go out to our podcast feed immediately, and then the second half will follow sometime midweek.

1245
01:14:06,115 --> 01:14:09,336
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a break here, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1246
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:19,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
