Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and the Lowkey

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, April 29th, 2007, Sony loses a well-known executive

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The PlayStation is set to get an eye

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's Tron on the way to Xbox Live Arcade

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Quizno is indirectly sponsored by Quiznos and Diet Wild Cherry Pepsi

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Also joining us tonight, we have somebody brand new who's never been on this program before

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And that's something else, because usually it's the same old prick of people in and out of here, like Grand Central Station

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So we have a brand new person visiting us tonight

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And you may recognize his name from various OLR emails and I think maybe phone calls in the past

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And now he's here live in studio, which just goes to prove that stalking works

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Say hello to Warrior Bob

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It does work. Hi everybody. Everybody laugh at the noob

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How you doing, noob?

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, not too bad, actually

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So wait a minute, okay, we gotta figure out, how did you get from OLR listener to now being here in the OLR studio

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So when did you first listen to Orange Lounge?

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, so I started listening to Orange Lounge probably two or more years ago

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It was right before iTunes started giving everybody podcasts

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I just, I got an iPod, I wanted podcasts, I like radio

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's look for all the good radio shows

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right, cool

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And I just stopped listening to most of them, except this one

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Awesome. Sucker

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Alright

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a good time

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But now you're here, where were you living before?

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I was living in San Luis Obispo, going to college

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But I'm originally from about an hour, maybe 40 minutes east of here

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
San Luis Obispo is like not that far from here, I'll think it's about a four or five hour drive, so

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Five, six, depending on how you drive

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
More for me

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
More conservative

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, cool, okay, so but now you're here because you grew up in this area, so cool

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, very cool

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, it's a lot of fun, thank you for having me

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No problem, we like having new people, especially guests that bring their own mics

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, I know

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So that's kind of nice

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's see how this one would work

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This mic, this guy brought is like more expensive probably than the three mics we've been using

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
for the last four years, so

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The secret is it was the cheapest mic I could find at the store I bought it from

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where'd you buy it at?

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, just a place in San Luis

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, well

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Alright, well cool

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, WorryBob will be lending his thoughts and stuff on all the gaming news tonight

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But first, we're going to go around and see how everybody's gaming week was in the little bit we call

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How was your gaming week, starting off with Dark Sakura?

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Well, I got Final Fantasy Advance 6 that Dan just bought for me that I haven't had a chance to play it yet

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Lots of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but it turns out that we're actually going to be playing that more regularly on our new Xbox 360 Elite system

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I like it because it's black

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I took a picture of it and put it on my MySpace

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Once you go black, you never go back

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mm-hmm

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Anyway

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Unless you buy the replacement hard drive, which is white

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
My hard drive, I also got a 500 gigabyte external hard drive, which is going to be loaded up with not porn

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Did you see that? She totally was saying porn

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And you can't see that

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Not porn

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can't see it if you're not in studio, but that wasn't even an intentional mistake

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
At any rate

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yowie is still porn, you do realize, right?

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not going to put Yowie on it

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to put lots of doujinshi, though

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Quick sidetrack, because we're talking about replacement hard drives and all that

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Loki, you're like a cracking type person

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Could she take a 500 gigabyte hard drive and somehow get it on her Xbox 360?

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Uh, no

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do I want to?

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Do I care?

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why not?

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can't see it because the drive has a special model number or serial number or something

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They have a program that you can do it up to the max of 120

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And it only works with one type of hard drive, I see

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But you can save 100 bucks doing it that way

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Interesting

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm telling you, Xbox, Microsoft, Major Nelson, all you people that have some power over Microsoft

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The key to winning the marketplace, the video download marketplace

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Even though from what I hear you guys are already number one for some type of delivery console

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But forget it

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you want to be even better, 11 times better

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How about my gaming week?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Porn downloads

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Porn downloads, what, your gaming week was porn downloads?

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, Rob, I wasn't finished

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Alright, go ahead

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I found out from Heather that one of my birthday presents

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What she got me is a paid account for Guild Wars

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So I guess I'll be playing more Guild Wars

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I think she tricked you, because you know that at Guild Wars all you have to do is buy the game

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I know, but I only had a trial

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ah, okay

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like, I, because I never bothered buying it, she just gave me the trial and I played it

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, that's cool

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yep

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So you're going to play, so Guild Wars will be what, like your seventh MMO you've actually played?

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In ten years, yeah

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, okay

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then again, I did spend, you know, the first seven of it on Ragnarok Online

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Alright

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Is that it?

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, Rob

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You sure?

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You sure you're sure?

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I thought Peter, you had a second

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
All I played was Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Earth Defense Force 2017

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That was it

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's it?

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But I played lots of Earth Defense Force 2017

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I finished normal and easy, working through hard, playing some of the infernal levels to get more weapons

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Although that hasn't been going too well, and then, I don't know, pretty soon I'm going to start playing some more Crackdown

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Um, because we're going to land two systems at work and get another copy of that

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then that'll be fun, so for some co-op

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And hopefully have a nice setup once Grand Theft Auto IV comes out

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And since Scenes of the Road just dropped in price, we may pick up some of those to do some multiplayer maybe

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I swear the only place I've ever even heard of Earth Defense Force is through light podcasts like you

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I never had heard of this game anywhere on the internet or nothing

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I gotta get my PlayStation 2 back from my sister because I've got Earth Defense Force 2 stored neatly on the hard drive

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But that game actually looks better than this one

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Because I think this is just a remake of the first one

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Are those games, or is that game really good? I want to buy it, but I don't know

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's so cheesy and stupid, but it's fun

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, well our chat room seems to think that it's a good game

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We have SSJ100Matt says Earth Defense Force equals Next Gen Body Harvest

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Deakman says Earth Defense Force 2017 equals awesome

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Dar Tetsuya says is Loki on whoever's doing EDF's payroll?

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
D3? No. No, I'm not on their payroll

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If they want to send me some of the sequels or anything else that they're putting out in the Simple series in the US, hell yeah, I'll take them

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They can thank you by translating more of them

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I mean seriously, their next game that's coming out is about this chick that's in lingerie with a cowboy hat fighting zombies off with a samurai sword

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I mean

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want that game

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What was that sound? Did somebody get a boner? What was that noise?

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No, I was trying to pick up the mic and hit the boner

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You got a boner?

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, Rob

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
She's the only one in the room with a laptop on her lap

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It was just a badly timed clink noise

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Shut up, I'm eating my chicken

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Better than eating your fish

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I hope they do put out a sequel though, because if they remake the second one or even just do a new one that's got some better enemies in it and stuff

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Hell, you can just do the same damn storyline, doesn't matter, because there really is no storyline

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's just blowing shit up, that's it

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can level the entire city and just come back the next level

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Or if you play the level over again

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Can't they just have a game called Blow Shit Up?

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
They have a gun in there called the genocide gun

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Isn't that that Hult game?

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What? No

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No, that was Ultimate Destruction

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
They need a game called Blow Shit Up, the game

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Press A button, blow shit up

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That would sell trillions of copies

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WarioWare genocide

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, that's pretty much Earth Defense Force

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I mean, because that's all you're doing, your mission

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, we need to destroy the ants

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, now we need to destroy the robots

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, now we need to destroy the robots and the ants

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's every level, it's no rescuing, no nothing

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's just, we're in a different location, let's blow shit up

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We're in a different location, let's blow shit up

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, there's a giant thing, blow it up

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, we can't blow it up, run

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I mean, that's it

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like I said, you can level everything

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Blaze says it's called Rampage, Rob

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Rampage is like one of the most monotonous fucking games ever made though

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's so boring

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You know, I realize a lot of people have this real fondness for the Rampage series

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because of the fact that you can play monsters and eat people and stuff

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But seriously, the gameplay is like the most monotonous game play I've ever played

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And they keep cranking out sequels, as if I'm interested

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's like SNK

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I love Metal Slug, shut up

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright, anything else for your gaming week, Mr. Loki?

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Vice City Stories, I'm still playing that, and it's still fun, multiplayer

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Gotta love it

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They better not make Grand Theft Auto 4 anything like Vice City Stories

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Because goddamn, the multiplayer is so fucking glitchy

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was playing the other day, and my card wasn't visible

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It was visible on my screen, but everybody else just saw me sitting down and floating through the air

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's pretty awesome, actually

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's ridiculous, there's a bunch of stuff that we've just coined terms for, like lawn dart syndrome

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Where the car will just stick into the ground at a weird angle

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Or like fat air, where your car will just stop like it hit something, but there's nothing there

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Weird stuff

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If I could write a book about this crap

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Alright, well I'm looking in the chat room at chat.orangelandtrader.com

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Remember, we do tape live on Sunday nights, and solicit your feedback here in chat

202
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
DDRDollarBill agrees with me, Rampage is nice for the first 10 levels, and after that, ZZZZZ, there's no ending

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
True, true that

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I played a game on Nintendo that was like that, it was only interesting for two levels

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Mag Max

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mag Max?

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Mag Max

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, Mag Max, I thought you meant Mad Max, like the Mel Gibson Australia

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Mag Max

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mag Max, I've never even heard of that

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was a really crappy game that every time I'd go visit my dad in the summer, my little sister had it

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I'd get ripped into playing it, and I'd be like, wow, this game sucks

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There were some pretty god-awful NES games, actually Mad Max

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Bible Stories

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Was one too

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh man, my friend and I sat around for like two hours once playing Bible Stories

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You guys are hardcore

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We were trying to beat the level with this sheep, and we couldn't do it

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There's this game I rented once, and I still remember the name to this day, don't laugh, okay?

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was a Color Dreams game, let's start with that, okay?

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And the Color Dreams game was called Master Chu and the Drunk Nerd Who

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And it's one of the most god-awful side-scroller games I've ever played in my entire freaking life

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I mean, there's a reason why Color Dreams was not allowed to use the regular NES shells, okay?

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I remember one time when, I remember how old I was when I rented one of the Color Dreams games

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And I was like, I want to rent that because it's blue

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Not because it's good, not because, you know, I'm like, hey, it's a blue cartridge

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That might be cool, I don't know

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Did you think, like, putting that in your Nintendo Entertainment System would somehow, like

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Unlock the secret mystery of the Pharaoh tomb from your, like, having the blue cartridge

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No, all that happened was it sucked really bad

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't even remember what game it was, some generic side-scroller that just looked like crap

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Alright, anyway, sorry, back to the present

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But my favorite, though, about the Nintendo system is Ikari Warriors and, like, stuff like that

234
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And how the game would get dust on it and would glitch out

235
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And, like, all you would do is, like, put your fingers on there and get some more prints on there

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And it'd glitch out different ways, it's like, I don't know, a plethora of glitching out

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Like you were talking to the glitch

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Like, for example, like, one of our characters when we were playing two-player co-op

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Would be running under everything

240
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It wouldn't actually be running on the lair above where the enemies are, but you could throw stuff and shoot

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But he was running under the world, almost

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You know, what I used to like to do is on the Super Nintendo, I would stay up really late all night

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And pick, um, game genie codes

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And then edit them until I came out with interesting results

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like, I ran around with, um, I called him Frog Mario

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Cause he would screen

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Isn't that Luigi?

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No, he was green in the face

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Either that or he was, like, morning green in the face

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hold your breath, Mario, keep holding it

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, don't let up

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And, like, the pillar effect

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Where the cloud pixels will just expand across the screen

255
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That was really weird

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Alright

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Anything else for your gaming week, Loki, back to the present?

258
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Uh, no

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Alright, I'll go

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Speaking of a game that hasn't really changed much in the past, like, ten years

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Uh, I bought Pokemon Pearl, I got suckered into buying Pokemon Pearl for the DS

262
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Cause my friend, you know, Miklotov, he's been on the show plenty of times, you guys know who he is

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Uh, he has, he got Pokemon Diamond the day it came out, and he's like

264
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Rob, you wanna get Pokemon Pearl, don't you?

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't you wanna get Pokemon Pearl? Come on!

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Come on! It's got voice chat, come on!

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We can play over the internet, come on!

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So, of course, I succumbed and I got Pokemon Pearl

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Uh, and you can do voice chat over the internet, which is actually kinda cool, it actually works pretty well

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Um, but here's the thing, is that Pokemon hasn't freaking changed since the old school Game Boy versions of it

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Like, what, twelve years ago, whenever the first ones came out?

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Those games have not changed at all!

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Like, okay, yeah, sure, in this DS one, now you have the little clock at the bottom

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And you can tap it and have, what, the step count meter and the, you know, thing that shows all your Pokemon at once, whatever

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But essentially, the battle system is the same freaking thing

276
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And the Pokemon still make those, like, 8-bit noises that sound like, you know, instead of Pikachu going like

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Pikachu, like he does in the cartoon, he goes

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
EEE-EE-EE-EE

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's like the sounds they all make, right?

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Like, they all make these, like, horrendous little blips and blops noise

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, sure, the TV is a huge screen, but to get the Pokemon to fit in the little handhelds, they have to just mash them in there

282
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I guess so

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
No room for them

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
So you'd be angry, too, making that noise if you had to get stuck into a little handheld system

285
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
EEE-EE-EE

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's like what some of the Pokemon make, they make these, like, god-awful noises

287
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They're pissed about you sticking them in those balls

288
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They're just like, here, no air, no food, no water

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Now fight for me

290
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Come on, you little bitch, what's wrong with you?

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He's sitting there, EEE-EE-EE-EE

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Shut up and fight

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You don't fight, you go back in the ball

294
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You want no ball, no ball

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, about Pokemon is that the Pokemon don't die

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Because no one dies in the Pokemon universe, they simply faint

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Okay, follow me with this, okay? This is gonna go on a weird tangent

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But I'm seeing, you know, we could take bum fights and almost, you know, evolving into Pokemon

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Because, I mean, if you think about it, you're basically capturing these, like, homeless creatures and shoving them into a ball

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That attack you in the wild

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah, attack you in the wild

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Stick them in a cardboard box

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
All we need to do now is get cages for the homeless, you know, capture them, you gotta get them all

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And get them to fight each other

305
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And then Nintendo could put it out and everybody would be, you know, accepting of it

306
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, but the game will probably have friend codes or some shit that'll screw you up

307
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh, yeah

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Alright, anyhow, but Pokemon, okay, yeah, even though it's essentially the same core game that it's been for the past 12 years

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't know, something feels kind of fun about playing it on the DS and it's, it's, it's fun

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm having a good time with it

311
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Why do they tack on, like, this weird, like, advanced stuff

312
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Like, for example, let's add voice over IP chat to Pokemon

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why? I mean, nobody's just, like, saying, I don't know, I'm gonna add GPS to Metroid

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I mean, it's just, why do we need that?

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That would actually be really cool

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, it's actually kind of cool because, like, now I kind of use it as a phone

317
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But it's, excuse me, it's kind of a pain to set it up

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Because, you know, you basically have to be chatting with whoever you want to trade with or whatever on Instant Messenger

319
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Like, hey, sign on to the Wi-Fi now and then I go, you know, I can go, okay, I'll sign on to the Wi-Fi as well

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And all that, and that's how you set it up

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I mean, you can't just go on to the Wi-Fi and blindly hope somebody's gonna be on

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I mean, it's not like Xbox where you're always connected, you know what I mean?

323
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, Nintendo doesn't want to make it easy, where's the fun in that?

324
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I guess not, so

325
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But the other interesting thing that Wi-Fi is doing is that now that you have this global trading network

326
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Is that, you know, you can trade these crap Pokémon for really good Pokémon

327
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Because I guess the Japanese folks who've had the game for a while kind of don't care

328
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And, I don't know, I was reading some article on the internet that they want English names

329
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Like, it's cool to have English names, I guess

330
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So, if you want my Pokémon, because I named my Pokémon really dumb stuff

331
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Like, I think I named my Bidoof, is that the name of the Pokémon?

332
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think I named him Muffins

333
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And I named them all cute things

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Muffins and Sparkles, I have one called Sparkles

335
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And Fancy Pants is one that my friend has

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So anyway, if that's really what's cool to have a Pokémon named Muffins, then go for it, I guess

337
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So, that's something I've been playing

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I've also been playing Pinball FX, which is a brand new Xbox Live Arcade download

339
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I haven't played it a lot, but it's Pinball on Xbox Live

340
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Is it Epic Pinball?

341
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't really care for any of the tables

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That was my problem with it, I didn't like the tables

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But, the physics and everything else with the game, I mean, is really good

344
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And, you know, it's got a lot of, you can change all the views

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And it definitely feels realistic, you know, multiplayer

346
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And they definitely build it to be expandable

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like, they're going to have new tables for download later on

348
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's just see how much they're going to charge us for them

349
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Hopefully it's not too bad, but we shall see

350
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'll have more to say on Pinball FX in later weeks

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Otherwise, I've just been playing World of Warcraft a lot

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Because since I was gone pretty much all last week

353
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I had rest bar for like a level and a half

354
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And it's Arathi Basin weekend, so, you know, I'm trying to get my new gear from Arathi Basin

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd

356
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Hey, Warrior Bob, how was your gaming week?

357
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
My gaming week was pitiful

358
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I was working a lot, so I tried to fit in games where I could

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Tried to play Frequency, but that's on a blue PS2 CD

360
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And my drive is dying and can't play those

361
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And I said, okay, that sucks, let's go play Sylphied, I'd like to play Sylphied

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, that's on a blue disc too

363
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Sylphied

364
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So I said, okay, screw this

365
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So I went over to my new Commodore

366
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And I tried to get the copy of Impossible Mission that was given to work

367
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That doesn't work either

368
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So I said screw it and went back to Guitar Hero

369
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So boring

370
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Wait, so you were going to get Impossible Mission on a Commodore 64?

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, so I bought a Commodore 64 a couple weeks ago

372
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's right, you wrote in the email talking about how you went to the thing

373
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But you haven't gotten anything to work on it

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, I've gotten...

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, what game did I get to work on that?

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I got The Hobbit to work on it

377
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Which is, well, it's a text adventure

378
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And I didn't really have the time to put in for one

379
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I wanted an action game

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Although I did go on GameTap

381
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I took it back, I went on GameTap

382
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which I downloaded on a whim recently

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And played that Commodore breakdancing game

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Break-in or whatever it's called

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Have you played that thing?

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I did for a little bit

387
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's like Simon Says Play DDR

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, it's like DDR on the Commodore 64

389
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It meets Busta Crap

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That game was so terrible

391
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Busta Crap

392
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So bad

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But yeah, that was my gaming week

394
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mostly Guitar Hero

395
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, Guitar Hero

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Alright, very cool

397
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Alright, well, getting into some other stuff before we get into tonight's gaming news

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Just wanted to say sorry that we missed last week

399
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Jamie and I were on vacation

400
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And even before we went on vacation

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I was out of town for most of the week

402
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So we were so behind on gaming news

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That it would have been kind of hard for us to do a show

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And we didn't even

405
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We really actually didn't even get home from the trip

406
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Until like 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't remember, but it was really late when we got back

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But we do wanted to say a big, big thank you to OLR listener Peter

409
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
At Disneyland for giving us the fat hookup while we were there

410
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Because Peter's been listening to the show

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And knows that Jamie and I are a little bit of Disney freaks

412
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah

413
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah, so that was really cool of Peter to meet us there

414
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And give us the hookup and all that stuff

415
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So thanks, dude

416
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And hope to see you again

417
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And we'll hopefully, maybe in future weeks

418
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Give the OLR listeners a little more warning

419
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
When we're going to Disneyland next time

420
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And maybe do a little meet up there or something

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Because that'll be fun

422
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We could all ride pirates together

423
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And sing along with it

424
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, exactly

425
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Because that won't annoy the other people in the boat to hell or anything

426
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The drunken sorority girls were funny

427
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh yeah, the drunken sorority

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
In the boat ahead of us

429
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I kept expecting one to fall in

430
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Didn't the one girl go like, I love you

431
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
At me or something

432
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How were the changes

433
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I was doing that to Barbossa

434
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The changes on pirates?

435
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yeah, I still haven't seen it yet

436
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's, you know, they

437
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
YouTube

438
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's, they have Jack Sparrow in it

439
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Which of course gives everybody this big fan-gasm

440
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I think it changed for the better

441
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
There were two series of changes

442
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Before this, I think

443
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
They tried to make the ride all PC

444
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, the politically correct version

445
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And then people bitched

446
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So they tried to ease it through

447
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Like, I don't know

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay, do you remember where the glutton pirate

449
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Would sit down by the barrel

450
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And this girl would come out of it and say

451
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You know, he wanted the girl too

452
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
When she was hiding in the barrel behind him

453
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And then they changed it to something else

454
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Like she had something

455
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And then now it's Jack Sparrow hiding in the barrel

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But I like at the end when he's there singing

457
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh yeah, I like that too

458
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Where they have Johnny Depp at the end singing or whatever

459
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't call him Jack Sparrow

460
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I call him Johnny Depp

461
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Just because

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well

463
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It was really cool

464
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And you got to see the changes that they made to Haunted Mansion

465
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, I finally rode Haunted Mansion for the first time in like ten years

466
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, you didn't get to see it when they had the

467
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
With the old bride's attic

468
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
No, it was so long ago when I rode it when I was eight

469
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Rob had to be escorted off the ride

470
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes, when I was eight years old

471
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I had to be escorted off the ride

472
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because I screamed my head off

473
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Because the beginning is so freaking scary to that ride

474
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There are no windows and no doors

475
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And I'm like

476
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Ah ha ha ha!

477
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Ah ha ha ha!

478
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes, I seriously thought I was going to die

479
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You do everything and you look up and there's the skeleton hanging from the noose

480
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It was horrible for a kid

481
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You see all the pictures of the dead people

482
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Anyway, sorry, this isn't the Disneyland podcast

483
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I love the Disneyland podcast

484
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We had a good time

485
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But there are, you know, sometimes there's Disney games and stuff, right?

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Like I remember on the NES there was that horrible Adventures in the Magic Kingdom game

487
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Or Kingdom Hearts

488
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, there's that Meteos game

489
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I found out also though that I can get like an Uber discount through work for Disney World

490
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Hmm

491
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Like seven days for the price of four at a discount

492
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Seven days

493
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
There are also some pretty cool Flash games you can play

494
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
In case you wanted to know what it's like to be a Disney employee

495
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
They have at the website sims.themagical.nl

496
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And you can check out, they've got four different simulator rides on there

497
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You can run the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Phantom Manor

498
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Which is your Disney version of the Haunted Mansion

499
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Which is actually cooler than ours

500
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And also they had Thunder Mountain Railroad

501
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And you can actually kind of run those

502
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I actually played the Phantom Manor one

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And that was kind of fun

504
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It was, you know, looks very similar to like

505
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You know, I guess what you would actually see if you were operating the ride

506
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
By the way, all the rides go faster at night

507
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah, I was going to say in this simulator do the rides go faster at night

508
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
That's what I want to know

509
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I don't think so

510
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
That actually is our end joke

511
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Loose

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But it's really true on a lot of the rides

513
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's totally true

514
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The rides do go faster at night

515
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Anyway

516
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The teacups go really fast at night

517
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Alright, look, we've got to save this for another podcast

518
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So we need to get into some gaming news

519
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Since we did miss last week

520
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Loki's going to fill us in on some of the gaming news that we missed last week

521
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Since we didn't have a show

522
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Sorry kids

523
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Okay

524
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Anyways, real quick

525
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
There's a few things that were getting updated

526
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
A few systems

527
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
For example, the 360 got another backwards compatibility update

528
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Including some wonderful games being added to it

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Like Mercenaries

530
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's see, I believe they also had Panzer Dragoon Orta in there

531
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Turn to Castle Wolfenstein I guess is pretty cool

532
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And Street Fighter Anniversary Collection

533
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Soul Calibur 2

534
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And let's see here

535
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
This is kind of neat

536
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Guilty Gear Iseka

537
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So lots of fun stuff there

538
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And Jet Set Radio Future

539
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
How could I forget that?

540
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT are now both on the list

541
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But the combo disc is not on the list

542
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Riddle me that one

543
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It might work though

544
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No, it doesn't

545
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
People tried it

546
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Oh, okay, well then that sucks

547
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah

548
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Way to do your research, Loki

549
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It was on our own forums

550
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Just kidding

551
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Anyways

552
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Another thing

553
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Or another system that was getting an update

554
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Actually the Playstation 3

555
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And they went to firmware 1.7

556
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And that allows you now to be able to play Playstation 1 games on the Playstation 3

557
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Because there was all those Playstation 1 games previously that were only available for the PSP

558
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But you had to have a PS3 to download them

559
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Which is retarded in itself

560
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
But now you can actually use that to play those games

561
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So, hooray

562
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Another thing that's possibly going to happen pretty soon here

563
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Is Neo Geo games have been confirmed to be coming to the Virtual Console

564
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And according

565
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Originally they were thought the first couple games would be Metal Slug and King of Fighters

566
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But right now it hasn't been determined yet

567
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
What will be available and when

568
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But they are coming

569
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So that's good

570
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And then of course

571
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This was also interesting

572
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Konami has decided to close its Redwood City office

573
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And move everything to the LA offices

574
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So no more Northern California Gamers Day unfortunately

575
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Which is kind of interesting

576
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Because Dark Soccer and I actually were at that Konami office for just a little bit

577
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Last week on our way to Disneyland

578
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Which is the first time I've actually been there

579
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's in a really nice area though

580
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That business complex area

581
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's like the river going through and everything

582
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
They're probably having to move because rent is really big over there

583
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I wouldn't doubt it

584
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It's the Bay Area

585
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And then a couple more things I want to add here real quick

586
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Just real quick mentions

587
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Typing of the Dead 2 has been announced

588
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yes

589
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Using the House of the Dead 3 engine

590
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So that's kind of exciting

591
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And then if you're a fan of Pac-Man

592
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
They're going to be holding the Xbox 360 Pac-Man World Championships

593
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
In which you'll be able to

594
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Be crowned against the Pac-Man World Champion

595
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And receive a custom

596
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yippee

597
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Wait here's the prize

598
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You'll receive a custom Pac-Man 360

599
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
100,000 Microsoft points

600
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Which on Kotaku they joke is good for a couple

601
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Guitar Hero 2 songs

602
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And 26 years of one free Quizno subs a week

603
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay

604
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And then apparently

605
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Wait wait

606
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
26 years of a free Quizno sub a week

607
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yes

608
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Jesus

609
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Who knew Pac-Man was so wealthy?

610
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I guess

611
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So the contest begins April 25th

612
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Runs through May 9th

613
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And the finalists will be chosen

614
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And then they'll officially be on

615
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I guess there's some

616
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's being sponsored by Quiznos obviously

617
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But I'm going to be kind of interested

618
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Just like my dinner

619
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Are you going to enter the Pac-Man contest to start soccer?

620
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Probably not

621
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I suck at Pac-Man

622
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If you're interested in joining

623
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Go to XboxLiveTournament.com

624
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
To register

625
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's it

626
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Alright well thank you for the wrap up on last week's news

627
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It is very much appreciated

628
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Since we were too lazy to do a show last week

629
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So thank you

630
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Alright now let's go ahead and get into some gaming news from this week

631
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Making things current

632
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
In this week's news I was awesome as usual

633
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No really

634
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
April fools

635
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Hey Rob shut up

636
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's almost May

637
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Seriously

638
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Well in response to the demand for the Wii

639
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Nintendo has promised to increase production

640
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So that they can meet the demand that's out there for it

641
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
They said that they were producing 1 million units per month

642
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And are going to be increasing their manufacturing capacity

643
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So they can ship 14 million in the next fiscal year

644
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So yeah

645
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Wii

646
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So now you might actually be able to find one correct?

647
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Well so far to date 5.84 million Wii units have been sold so far

648
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Dang

649
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Which actually didn't they say that by the new year they were going to have 4 million out?

650
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't remember too many numbers with these sales things

651
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And then they always change

652
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Especially over at the Sony cap

653
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
It was like we're going to have a million out by the end of the year

654
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We're going to eat crayons

655
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Shipped

656
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Shipped

657
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah shipped

658
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No no we meant shipped

659
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Do we mean did we say by the end of the year we meant by the end of April

660
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We meant 10 boxes put together in the shape of a ship

661
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
When we said year we meant fiscal year

662
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
When we said year we meant fiscal year

663
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The new year doesn't start until we say it does

664
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We used the lunar calendar

665
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So I can't follow all this stupid you know goals and sales stuff

666
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I just find it very odd that they're just now announcing that they need the ramp up production

667
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Seen as we've been sold out of the Wii for months now

668
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And it's just very convenient that it happened after their fiscal year ended and all that stuff

669
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And now there's Wiis available

670
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Not like that they were stockpiling them or anything

671
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hmm yeah

672
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm sure they're ramping up production

673
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yep that's really what's going on

674
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Conspiracy theories abound here at Orange Lounge Radio

675
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Well one thing that's also conspiracy is where the hell are the games

676
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I mean we had

677
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I ate them

678
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
We had Super Paper Mario came out recently

679
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And um well

680
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Kororimpa I guess

681
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
No there was

682
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
No there's been

683
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
WarioWare and Wii Play

684
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Like four months ago but what's come out in like the past month

685
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Not a lot

686
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Wii Play I'm sure didn't take much so you know

687
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Work to get it finished since they were all the E3 tech demos

688
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well anyway

689
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So obviously a lot of folks are asking where's the games

690
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And Satoru Iwata said you want games?

691
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll give you games

692
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
He said the company is developing 124 games for the Wii and the Nintendo DS

693
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Now out of those 124

694
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
45 of them are in development for the Wii

695
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
79 in development for the DS

696
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So you might be going well you know why is the DS getting all the love

697
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Well because there's like what like 20 million DS's out there

698
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So obviously you know it's a very big platform to be developing for

699
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And of course 45 games just being developed not being released this year

700
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well who knows because here's a short list of some of the games being developed

701
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Super Smash Brothers Brawl

702
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The Legend of Zelda on the DS

703
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Phantom Hourglass

704
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Chibi Robo Park Patrol on the DS

705
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii

706
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You know Metroid and all that fun stuff

707
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Project Hammer and all those other crappy games

708
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Orzic Sight Truck 2

709
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
All those games you just mentioned were big A-list titles

710
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I mean how many other A-list titles are there?

711
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't know

712
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I was going to say because Nintendo's known for only putting out

713
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
One, two really big name games a year

714
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So yeah they've got 40 games in development for the Wii for the next four years

715
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So that's 10 a year

716
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But also that's them that they have in development too

717
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
All those games are what Nintendo has in house developing

718
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Mario Party 8 and so on and so on

719
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But outside that's not counting what Konami's got in development

720
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
What Capcom's got in development and the third party stuff

721
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So hopefully they keep some good stuff coming too

722
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah

723
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Cooking Mama 2

724
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Revenge of the Horrible Translation

725
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Boo

726
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Stop porting DS games to the Wii

727
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
It's just like stop porting Game Boy Advance games to the DS

728
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Next thing you know we'll have Game Boy Advance games coming to the Wii

729
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Sephiroth 1215 in our chatroom

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
chat.orangelandrater.com reminds us of another story that came up this week

731
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I don't think it was on our show roll

732
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But Hideo Kojima played Super Smash Bros. Brawl

733
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And apparently it's nearly done according to I think some podcast

734
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Where there was an interview with Kojima

735
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
He's actually played it and it's just about done

736
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I remember reading something about he was afraid to punch Mario

737
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Because Mario's such a legend

738
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I've lost all respect for him

739
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I know seriously

740
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's a fighting game

741
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
He makes freaking Metal Gear games

742
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Shoot people in the face and then it's like

743
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Oh but I can't punch Mario

744
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I can't punch a fat plumber

745
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I can't do that

746
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I think it was one of those where he hesitates for a minute

747
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And he says oh no I can't punch Mario

748
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Five seconds later

749
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm sure he's embellishing a little bit

750
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
He's like yeah

751
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh I hesitated for a second because I couldn't punch him

752
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Because I loved Mario growing up

753
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But then after I got past that

754
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It was fucking on

755
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I owned the crap out of the water

756
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Our chat has some awesome ideas for Cooking Mama sequels

757
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
TheRobD says Cooking Mama 2

758
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Mama teaches You Poison

759
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And um

760
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Sakura Max says Cooking Mama 2

761
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Cooking Drugs

762
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Mama's crack house

763
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Don't worry

764
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Mama will fix it

765
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Mama will give you your fix

766
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Win

767
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Or even better

768
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Mama's son or whatever

769
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Accidentally kills one of his friends

770
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Don't worry Mama will fix it

771
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We're going to chop the body up

772
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And put it in the food

773
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
We'll hide that

774
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
No one will notice

775
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Anywho

776
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Turkey surprise

777
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So apparently Square Enix has said that

778
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
There will not be any of their games

779
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Coming to at least the Japanese

780
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Virtual console

781
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
At least that's what's kind of hinted

782
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Lies

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I think so too

784
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
They're saying that we feel the Japanese market

785
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Is a problem in the media

786
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Also Final Fantasy Dragon Quest

787
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Are played by a wide range of users

788
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
From children to adults

789
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So limitations when you consider a problem

790
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That we would have with billing systems

791
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Okay

792
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That's retarded

793
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What game have I been bitching and bitching about

794
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That the Japanese have and Europe has

795
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But we still don't have

796
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What game have I been bitching on this show

797
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Oonga Boonga

798
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Pop Quiz

799
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Actraiser

800
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Who made Actraiser

801
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Square

802
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Enix made Actraiser

803
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Square Enix

804
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So what do you mean Square Enix

805
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Games aren't coming to Virtual Console

806
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Actraiser is already there

807
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
What do you mean it's not in the US

808
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I bought a cartridge of that not long ago

809
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let me put it this way okay

810
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
To be honest this is coming from

811
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Originally from an IGN interview

812
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
With a Square Enix representative

813
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And it's actually from

814
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I guess a magazine Nintendo Dream

815
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Or something like that

816
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I'm pretty sure that there's something lost in translation

817
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Here because I think what they're talking about

818
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Is digital downloads in Japan

819
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That they aren't going to go to a strictly

820
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Digital download system or whatever

821
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And it might make sense

822
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That they might not put like

823
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Final Fantasy 1 or 2 or whatever

824
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
On the Virtual Console because they're re-releasing them

825
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I was going to say that's what it is

826
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
They're not saying they're not going to put their games on Virtual Console

827
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
They're saying they're not going to put Final Fantasy 2

828
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
And 3 and so on

829
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
On Virtual Console because you stupid Americans

830
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Will continue to pay $29.99

831
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
For the Game Boy Advance versions because they're so

832
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Awesome they're so cool

833
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But they're not going to put them on Virtual Console

834
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Because of that I think that's the reason yeah

835
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But I would say there is still hope

836
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
For Illusion of Gaia and

837
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Soul Blazers and all those other old school

838
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Enix games at least I don't know about Chrono Trigger

839
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Because they'll probably do

840
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
An advanced version of that at some point

841
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I will bet you money

842
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That there will be a PSP

843
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Version of Chrono Trigger in some time

844
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
In the near future because they love

845
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Releasing

846
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Re-releases and stuff

847
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Is this something in your database you're just afraid to say something about?

848
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
This is purely speculation because

849
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
They're doing Star Ocean

850
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
They're supposed to be a new Star Ocean

851
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Game which I do believe we did see

852
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
A little movie for it a couple

853
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Years ago at E3 I could have sworn

854
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It was just like that

855
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
There was like another game series

856
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That they were teasing too that I haven't seen

857
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Anything on like

858
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The code something or whatever

859
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Wasn't there one year at E3 when you went into

860
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The Square Enix movie room and you saw all the

861
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Movies literally every single

862
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Freaking thing they showed was a Final Fantasy

863
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Game and then like oh and Star Ocean

864
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah it was something like that

865
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I know that there has been a trailer

866
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Because like I said there was

867
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Some other game series that they were doing

868
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That were supposed to be mobile, Playstation 2

869
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I think maybe PSP or something

870
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That they haven't released yet

871
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That's going to be coming out

872
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
DDRDollarBill says

873
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
If they do an advanced version of Chrono Trigger

874
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It better be that fucking good

875
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I will be fucking pissed off if they try to fix it

876
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And damage it

877
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He's letting his fucking thoughts be known there

878
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Such overuse of the F word there

879
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
What the fuck word?

880
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
See it's because

881
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You know why it's because Chrono Trigger fans are crazy

882
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Like they're rabid about their Chrono Trigger

883
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And if you ever try to

884
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Get in that whole Final Fantasy 6 is better

885
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Than Chrono Trigger debate, it's like

886
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
No it's not

887
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You have to wonder, he said fix

888
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What exactly does fix mean?

889
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Because it's like the translation changes they made in Final Fantasy 7

890
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
That's what it was, Code Age

891
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Was the game that they were teasing and stuff

892
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Remember there was supposed to be three different games in that series

893
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
One of them, Code Age Commanders

894
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Was supposed to be on Playstation 2

895
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I believe the cell phones had another one

896
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Code Age something

897
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I don't remember what the other

898
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
System it was on

899
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Code Age

900
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Where'd it go? I just saw it

901
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Code Age Brawls is going to be the wireless one

902
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Who cares

903
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Alright well

904
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Regardless

905
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I think it's certainly possible we're going to see

906
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
At least some of the Enix games show up on Virtual Console

907
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Especially because in the case of

908
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Illusion of Gaia, Nintendo

909
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I think published it

910
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Even though Enix made it if I remember right

911
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Because there was a strategy guide and everything

912
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So I think some of those games are still possible

913
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
But as far as the Final Fantasy and Chrono Triggers of the world

914
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I want my goddamn

915
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Super Mario RPG

916
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
What the hell do I have to do to get this damn game?

917
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You have to mod your Xbox

918
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Which I know you've done and play it on an emulator

919
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And then you paint your Xbox white

920
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And you call it a Wii

921
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Wii

922
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Wii

923
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So anyway

924
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Just a little bit of news

925
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
For the Tokyo Game Show

926
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Nintendo actually will be a big participant there

927
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This is actually the first time

928
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Since 1996 that

929
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Nintendo is having a booth there

930
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So it's a pretty big deal

931
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But it's supposed to be

932
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
This massive, massive booth

933
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So I think that's going to be pretty cool

934
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That actually is in relation to

935
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Dragon Quest 9

936
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Ah I see

937
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So Nintendo is always like

938
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh we're not going to go to the Tokyo Game Show

939
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But now that they have Dragon Quest

940
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
They're like well we better fucking go

941
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Because Dragon Quest is

942
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Because Square Enix calls the shots

943
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Fuckers

944
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Get my goddamn Super Mario RPG

945
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Get over it

946
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Dragon Quest 9 on the DS

947
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Is probably the reason for that

948
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
So Loki since we suck

949
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And we're not going to E3

950
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I think we ought to save money and go to Tokyo Game Show

951
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That might be fun

952
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Oh come on you don't want to go to Tokyo?

953
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Right

954
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Because E3 wasn't bad enough

955
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I have to go someplace where I don't understand anything

956
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And he can cosplay

957
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Look at me

958
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm stupid American foreigner

959
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Oh film him he crazy

960
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I mean seriously

961
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'm just like

962
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
No

963
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Wow

964
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I can play DDR they'd love that

965
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I could be on a variety show or something

966
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
American guy play DDR

967
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That white man playing DDR

968
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So funny

969
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
He uncoordinated

970
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You see what happens when we're gone for a week

971
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's just like

972
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Man somebody put some drugs in the food

973
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Anyhow

974
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Speaking of the Wii and things possibly in development

975
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
For it what about a keyboard

976
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The latest Game Informer

977
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Magazine has a little spiel on a Wii

978
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Keyboard it says quote

979
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Nintendo's development team says that it's considering

980
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
A keyboard peripheral to the system

981
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
In order to make online surfing easier

982
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But it has not officially announced

983
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Anything at this time

984
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Why would they want to make online surfing easier

985
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
They're not making online friend codes easier

986
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh wait no friend codes aren't easy so

987
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Well what if they put

988
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Super Mario RPG in like flash or something

989
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Then you could use your browser to play it on the Wii

990
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I bet you'd need a friend code to get to it

991
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah you'd need a friend code to use the damn keyboard

992
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So all the keyboards will enhance the ability to put in

993
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Your friend codes faster

994
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Which is why we're not getting rid of them

995
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Here's my advice to everyone that wants to surf

996
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The internet faster on the Wii

997
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Go to your PC

998
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And surf it there

999
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Put your PC on your Wii

1000
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So you're technically surfing it on your Wii

1001
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
There you go

1002
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Science

1003
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Yeah so I guess the Wii is going to get a keyboard

1004
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But I don't see the point unless there's like

1005
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Games that start supporting it

1006
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Typing of the Dead

1007
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Hey

1008
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Typing of the Dead

1009
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
That would be great if you had a motion sensing keyboard

1010
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And you could actually aim the keyboard

1011
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And then press the enter key

1012
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You know they could do I think though

1013
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That would be rad

1014
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
They could do the gun survivor series

1015
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Oh yeah they could

1016
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
On Wii

1017
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
No I want a typing of the dead 2

1018
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Where I literally have to pick up my keyboard

1019
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And smack zombies with it

1020
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That's better

1021
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
House of the Dead is a light gun game

1022
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You just plug your keyboard in

1023
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
The keyboard guy fills up the guy with the pointer with typing

1024
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Energy or whatever crazy thing they come up with

1025
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Because everything you have to plug into

1026
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The Wii remotes anyways

1027
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You have to plug in the classic controller

1028
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Has to be threaded through your Wii remote and all the enhancements

1029
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So this keyboard is probably going to have to

1030
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Plug into the Wii remote so you have this big thing

1031
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Dangling there off your keyboard

1032
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
There's nothing that will stop you from duct taping the Wii mote to the keyboard

1033
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So you use that as your light gun pointer while you're typing

1034
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Beautiful

1035
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The keyboard in your lap you're trying to shift your waist around

1036
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You just put it on your head

1037
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Move your head around

1038
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
What was that old Atari thing that they had that was controlled by your eyebrows?

1039
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Do you remember that Rob?

1040
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I know

1041
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
They had this Atari controller back in the day

1042
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That you would

1043
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It was trying to be like the ESP controller

1044
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But really all you did was wiggle your eyebrows and move your nose a certain way

1045
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Trying to distract you when you were playing ET from how bad it was

1046
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
What?

1047
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'll try to find it

1048
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Little do the listeners know

1049
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That Dark Sakura's Folgers Coffee has been secretly replaced with LSD

1050
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
It was a real controller with some prototype that never came out anyway

1051
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I thought that you with your gaming knowledge would know this Rob

1052
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You disappoint me

1053
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You know what I was playing on Atari 2600?

1054
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Adventure

1055
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And there was no eye wiggling

1056
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Or nose twitching

1057
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I dream of genie motions

1058
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Going on in that game

1059
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Yellow block vs squiggly thing called the Dragon

1060
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The Atari Mind Link controller

1061
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That was it

1062
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Leave it to the chat room to figure that one out

1063
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It's Bewitched technology

1064
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
No it wasn't the chat room that came up with that one

1065
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I found it

1066
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Put it using the Wikipedia link now

1067
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Along with your bad Wikipedia self

1068
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Mix that thing with that Amiga lap board controllers

1069
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You had to do that

1070
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Do you know about that one?

1071
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
The Zen Guru Master game

1072
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It was a plank that you sat on and on either side of it was a switch

1073
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So if you tilted too far to the left or right

1074
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You broke your concentration and the game failed you

1075
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
You were a disappointed guru

1076
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We need to seriously dig up some of this shit and just play it on the show one night

1077
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Some of these games sound really awful

1078
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We should have the most frustrating game challenge

1079
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Let's hook up a Sega Activator to that Commodore Break Dance game

1080
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I have a Sega Activator

1081
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yeah me too

1082
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Or play anything with the Power Glove

1083
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Anything

1084
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The Power Glove was a piece of shit

1085
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Anyways

1086
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Apparently Time magazine has nominated Miyamoto for part of the 100 most influential people

1087
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:06,000
He's done a lot of things including creating Super Mario and Donkey Kong

1088
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Zelda

1089
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The Wii

1090
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
All that fun stuff

1091
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I think they have to do this because it's a new game console

1092
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It's just like they have to nominate Bill Gates and probably Oprah every year and stuff like that

1093
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It's just a gamey

1094
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I actually looked at the results the other day and Miyamoto was number 2 on this little user poll

1095
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
They have the user poll where you can vote for who you believe is the most influential

1096
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I believe he was number 2

1097
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I think Perez Hilton was number 5

1098
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
He's doing a really good job beating such influential people like that

1099
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You should just do the whole Time 100 thing out of the WeVote channel

1100
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Who's more influential?

1101
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Purple!

1102
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Or Pink or whatever

1103
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
No that was Perez Hilton

1104
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I need to check the voting channel

1105
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I haven't used that channel in a long time

1106
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Last time I played it I remembered there was a question

1107
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Who's going to win American Idol?

1108
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Melinda Sanjaya

1109
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That's like the second American Idol related question that's been on that stupid WeVotes channel

1110
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It's fascinating

1111
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They still haven't used any of my submissions

1112
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
This makes me very sad

1113
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Clowns or rape?

1114
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I think I submitted a question that said which is funnier clowns or rape?

1115
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
No I'm just kidding

1116
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm going to get so much hate mail

1117
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I was drunk

1118
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I'm going to get hate mail from clowns

1119
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I hate clowns

1120
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I submitted a serious one that says which dessert is better?

1121
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Cake or pie?

1122
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
You know this is something that needs to be asked

1123
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Of the American public

1124
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We need to settle this debate once and for all

1125
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I swear to god pie is better

1126
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I should do one that says are you damned if you do or damned if you don't?

1127
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Is the glass half empty or half full?

1128
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Anyway

1129
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Happy happy day

1130
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Ken Kutaragi

1131
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He of the crayon eating

1132
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Bicycle helmet wearing

1133
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
You know

1134
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Leash

1135
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I want to make more further shots of that

1136
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
He who sucks so bad

1137
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Has retired from his position

1138
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
With the Playstation

1139
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
But he's still the honorary chairman of SCEI

1140
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So

1141
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Everyone can let out a collective sigh of relief

1142
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Except

1143
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Guess what happens when you cut off this head

1144
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Another one has regrown in its place

1145
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
In the form of Kazuo Hirai

1146
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Kutaragi is a hydra

1147
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Yes

1148
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Giant enemy hydra

1149
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Anyways

1150
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
What's a Nubian

1151
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Shut the fuck up

1152
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I don't know I'm suddenly reminded of that for some reason

1153
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I love that whole scene

1154
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
What's a Nubian

1155
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Bitch you almost made me laugh

1156
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Anyways

1157
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I love

1158
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
But fear not

1159
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Because the craziness at Sony is still not over

1160
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Ken may be gone

1161
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But their PR department is still there

1162
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
To make a complete ass of themselves

1163
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Including such things as

1164
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
The Playstation 2 launch party

1165
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
For God of War 2

1166
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
In the UK

1167
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
They've decided to celebrate this in the non offensive way

1168
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
At all by offering

1169
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
A decapitated goat

1170
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Which

1171
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Guests were invited to

1172
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Reach in and eat offal

1173
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
From the stomach of the goat

1174
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Also there were naked chicks there as well

1175
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So

1176
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Apparently people are a little pissed off at the fact

1177
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
That there was a decapitated goat there

1178
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
That was still

1179
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Warm you know

1180
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
PETA

1181
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Didn't you eat PETA

1182
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Earlier

1183
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
People eating tasty animals

1184
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
But apparently

1185
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
People were pissed off at this

1186
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'm pissed off because I wasn't invited

1187
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Sounds like fun

1188
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
They had topless girls

1189
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
That were dripping

1190
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Grapes into guests mouths

1191
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Male model portraying Kratos

1192
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And

1193
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
He was handing out garlands

1194
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Apparently

1195
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
The international fund for

1196
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Animal welfare said

1197
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
It was outrageous that the animals death

1198
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Have to be used to sell a few computer games

1199
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Dude

1200
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I dare one of our listeners to email

1201
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
PETA a link to one of these stories

1202
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
What is their website?

1203
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
PETA2.org or something

1204
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I once

1205
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Went out with someone who worked for PETA

1206
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
And man they're nuts

1207
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
So I want to see what happens when they get

1208
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
A hold of this story

1209
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't know I'm sick

1210
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I have a problem

1211
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
There's a sick side of me that really wants to see what will happen

1212
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
When PETA gets a hold of what's going on here

1213
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Honestly I mean

1214
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Other than the fact that it is kind of cool though

1215
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That they do have like you know

1216
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Topless chicks there

1217
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But

1218
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
What PR guy thought it was a great idea

1219
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
To decapitate a goat at a party

1220
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
And have people eat from its entrails

1221
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I mean

1222
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Who proves this crap?

1223
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Like I mean seriously was some guy

1224
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Like sitting there playing a game or something

1225
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah I need you to prove this

1226
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
PR event info

1227
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Back to playing God of War 2

1228
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I could play the sex minigame

1229
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Maybe it was an animatronic goat

1230
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Not judging by the picture on that article

1231
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They blurred out

1232
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
The decapitated goat

1233
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Blurred out the decapitated head

1234
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
That apparently was hanging on by a string

1235
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Still

1236
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Is that like some type of you know

1237
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Ancient Roman custom?

1238
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
They seem to think so

1239
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I want to say I was reading some thread about this

1240
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
On the internet and someone came out and said

1241
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Well actually you know I

1242
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I live with a scholar on Greece

1243
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And no they didn't do this at all

1244
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So they got it wrong

1245
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I have no idea if this is true or not

1246
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It says apparently

1247
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Well dude

1248
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I can hear the Sony meeting now

1249
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And the Angra PD letters start coming

1250
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Whoa we read about it on Wikipedia

1251
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So it must be true

1252
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I mean what do you mean

1253
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
They didn't decapitate goats in Greece

1254
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It was on Wikipedia

1255
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah

1256
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Speaking of things hanging on by a string

1257
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Kudaraki may have some hope left

1258
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
In where he can go next

1259
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I mean true he's going to be on the board at you know Sony or whatever

1260
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But

1261
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Very interesting

1262
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Satoru Iwata made a very interesting comment

1263
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Of course Iwata being the president of Nintendo

1264
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Iwata stated quote

1265
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
They would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo

1266
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Yeah

1267
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Doesn't that prospect make you excited?

1268
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Kudaraki would be like

1269
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We will be producing 10 billion wii's

1270
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Next week

1271
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Rob it makes me so excited

1272
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
That I feel irregular

1273
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Now of course the likelihood of this actually happening

1274
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Is slim to none

1275
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Seeing as you know Kudaraki is still on the board

1276
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Over at Sony Europe

1277
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And also you notice Iwata didn't say exactly

1278
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
What Kudaraki would do at Nintendo

1279
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You know

1280
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I think the rest of the quote

1281
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
The quote was would love to see Kudaraki join up with Nintendo

1282
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And then the rest of the quote was

1283
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
In the available warehouse position

1284
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
That we have

1285
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Tailing out the wii's to best buys all over the world

1286
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
They named him chief operating officer of crayons

1287
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Of the janitorial department

1288
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
You realize the acronym for which is kook

1289
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Anyway

1290
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
So moving forward

1291
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
How about some news that doesn't involve Kudaraki please

1292
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Well kind of

1293
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Alright

1294
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
The Playstation store now has available Ninja Gaiden Sigma

1295
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
The demo is available

1296
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Here in the US

1297
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And also a demo

1298
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
For Virtua Tennis

1299
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So that's pretty cool

1300
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Also trailers for

1301
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Gauntlet 2

1302
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
The Wheelman

1303
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
John Woo's Stranglehold

1304
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And the full version of Ninja Gaiden Sigma

1305
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Is set for June

1306
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So basically you could sum this

1307
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Whole story up by basically saying

1308
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Playstation network actually

1309
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Gets content

1310
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
There was Tekken

1311
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I guess that's true

1312
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
There was Tekken

1313
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
There was Xbox 360

1314
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Hey to their credit

1315
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Has upped it to two arcade titles a week

1316
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Recently so you know

1317
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
More than some of us can handle

1318
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So there you go

1319
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Speaking of stuff coming out soon

1320
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
We're going to take a look around the world

1321
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
At some various release dates

1322
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
What's coming up in the near future in some various countries

1323
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Around the world

1324
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And during my portion of this segment

1325
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I usually talk about what's going on in Japan

1326
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
With the Japanese release dates

1327
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Really not a lot

1328
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
There's some peripherals coming out for the Wii

1329
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And for the DS but honestly game wise

1330
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
As far as Japanese release dates go

1331
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
There's really only like one game

1332
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Coming out

1333
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And that would be this game on the Nintendo DS

1334
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Called Osawari Tantai

1335
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Osawarina

1336
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Also known as Good Prince

1337
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And it's an adventure game coming out from

1338
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm not sure who actually

1339
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Is putting this out

1340
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Success is putting this out

1341
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Based on an anime game

1342
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I'm trying to see if there's actually screenshots from the game here

1343
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Looks to be

1344
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Well very boring actually

1345
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Is what the game looks to be

1346
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So if you are interested in boring games check that one out

1347
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That's it for Japanese release dates

1348
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
There's really nothing coming out this week over there

1349
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
We want more release dates

1350
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
More

1351
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
More

1352
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Spelled with an A

1353
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Okay

1354
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You can get really excited about

1355
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
A face cover portable

1356
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Coming out on the Sony PSP

1357
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
In black, blue, pink, and white

1358
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's my favorite game already

1359
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Face cover portable

1360
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
You stick the PSP in front of your face

1361
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And it puts like

1362
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Different faces on your face

1363
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I think it's great that they have a face cover

1364
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
In black when the PSP is black

1365
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Oh it's a system cover

1366
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I get it

1367
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Anyways for the US we actually do have some things

1368
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Coming out

1369
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
There's going to be Spiderman 3 the game

1370
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Coming out on Friday to coincide with movies

1371
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Basically on every system

1372
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
In fact the Playstation 3 is getting

1373
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
A special limited edition one as well

1374
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
On the Wii

1375
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
We are also getting Heat Seeker

1376
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Which is also coming out on Playstation 2

1377
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
As well

1378
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Also Legend of the Dragon

1379
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Which is based off some really crappy

1380
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I guess TV animated series

1381
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
On the Disney channel

1382
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And it's coming out on the Wii

1383
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And Playstation 2 as well

1384
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Also this week though

1385
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
We should be seeing

1386
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
God

1387
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I want to say

1388
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
There's actually

1389
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Not too much else coming out

1390
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
There's the cube on

1391
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
PSP which is like a puzzle game

1392
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The ultimate board game collection

1393
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Which is coming out from

1394
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Or it's being distributed through

1395
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Capcom

1396
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
The ultimate in board games

1397
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It's a board game collection

1398
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We're going to fuck you up

1399
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
With some sorry

1400
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You can't handle

1401
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
All this clue we got up in here

1402
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But here's

1403
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I think I'll leave it with the

1404
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Some of the best stuff right here

1405
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
We've got

1406
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
This part's cheesy

1407
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
On the PC

1408
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Fairy Godmother Tycoon

1409
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Is coming out

1410
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Once again proving that there are way too many

1411
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Board game tycoon games

1412
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Board game tycoon

1413
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah

1414
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I vote for

1415
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Although I did find the coolest board game today

1416
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And apparently it's one that's been out for a while

1417
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And I just didn't know about it

1418
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Anti-monopoly

1419
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I've never heard of anti-monopoly

1420
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That's why when you win the game you lose

1421
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Because the government breaks you up

1422
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I think so

1423
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Anyway how about some UK release dates

1424
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That point to owning Baltic Avenue

1425
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And Mediterranean

1426
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I think it's good PR

1427
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Anyway

1428
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
All these release dates are for the 4th

1429
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
We have Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops

1430
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
On PSP

1431
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
We have Mindy Storm on DS

1432
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
We have Tony Hawk's Project 8

1433
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
On PSP

1434
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Untold Legends Dark Kingdom on Playstation 3

1435
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And Final Fantasy 3 for the DS

1436
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yay

1437
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Final Fantasy 3 is a good one

1438
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
There's a lot of good games in that

1439
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It's about time you folks over in the UK got to check that one out

1440
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops was pretty good

1441
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah, good stuff

1442
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Man later on they're getting some other really good games

1443
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Like Mario Strikers

1444
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Ooh Spongebob

1445
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Actually I heard that Strikers really sucks

1446
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But you didn't hear that from me

1447
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Hey how about Picross

1448
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
There you go

1449
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Alright anyhow

1450
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Moving on to stuff coming out in the future

1451
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Eternal Sonata

1452
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Eternal Sonata of course known as what

1453
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Trusty Bell over in Japan we're getting

1454
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Eternal Sonata and what's interesting

1455
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Is that the ESRB is showing that this game

1456
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Is not just coming out on the Xbox 360

1457
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But it's also coming out on the Playstation 3

1458
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Kind of interesting because

1459
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
You've heard about all these you know exclusive

1460
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Games going from the Playstation 3

1461
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Over to the Xbox 360

1462
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
But this is one you know I think a lot of people were looking forward to

1463
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
That now seems to have gone the other way

1464
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Of course if I recall right Eternal Sonata

1465
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Was never promised as an exclusive title

1466
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Either way so it's not like this is like

1467
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Huge like OMG

1468
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Microsoft got pwned type news

1469
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
No it's just you know hey it might be coming

1470
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Out for this other platform as well

1471
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And of course this would be the one that's what it's based all

1472
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Off what Chopin's music

1473
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Or something

1474
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
I think that's right

1475
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It looks like an interesting title based on the

1476
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Screenshots it looks very like Final Fantasy

1477
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Ish and I like how the

1478
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Characters names are like Polka

1479
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And Allegretto and all that stuff that's cute

1480
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It's basically about

1481
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
A magical land that

1482
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
When you get terminally

1483
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Ill you go to this magical land

1484
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
That's what happens

1485
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's like that cloud thing wait so this is

1486
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Make-A-Wish the game? Basically yes

1487
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Okay

1488
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Anyways

1489
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
The Playstation Network is also getting

1490
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Some other interesting games coming out

1491
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Including a game

1492
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Called Snakeball which is supposedly

1493
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
The

1494
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
The funkiest online sport

1495
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Ever created

1496
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
The quotes IGN

1497
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So no idea what exactly

1498
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That's gonna be but

1499
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I don't know it looks cute I guess

1500
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It's got like a little penguin shy guy thing on there

1501
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So that's kinda neat

1502
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That's cute except the game is called

1503
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Snakeball

1504
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That's just asking for trouble in VR

1505
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But anyways it says

1506
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And I believe Snakeball could be a euphemism for

1507
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Penis

1508
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Because there's a snake and balls

1509
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Snakeball you I guess

1510
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Are donning your disco shoes

1511
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And you glide across a dance floor

1512
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
On a hover snake

1513
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
While collecting colored balls to score

1514
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Points and it says other players

1515
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Can rapidly reduce your point

1516
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Tally by flicking you with their

1517
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Tails or blasting you with

1518
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Their weapons and I guess

1519
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's gonna support

1520
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
An option to

1521
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Import your face and map it on to stuff

1522
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I don't know

1523
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Looks okay it's kinda neat

1524
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
The other thing that they're gonna be getting

1525
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Is a brand new game called

1526
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Stardust HD

1527
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Which I guess is a cross between asteroids

1528
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And I guess

1529
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Since everybody compares this

1530
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Games to this

1531
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Geometry Wars

1532
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So yet another game

1533
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Where you blow up a lot of shit

1534
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I think a game is like Geometry Wars

1535
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
If you shoot stuff

1536
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Hostile one in our chatroom

1537
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Chat.orangelandtrader.com has a comment on the

1538
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Snakeballs game he says

1539
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Get these motherfucking snakeballs off

1540
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
My motherfucking console

1541
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Get it? Like snakes on

1542
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yeah get it?

1543
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Movie sucked

1544
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Dude I love snakes on the plane but I really liked it

1545
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Just for the situation I saw it in

1546
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Where me and Meg Z and Chris all had stuffed

1547
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Snakes that we picked up at the uh

1548
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The Trader across from Indiana Jones and wore them into the theater

1549
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I thought you were gonna say it was an in flight movie

1550
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
That would've been great

1551
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Can I touch you? Or will I

1552
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Will I bleed from your awesomeness?

1553
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I don't know

1554
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Wow

1555
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I feel like death

1556
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I got gay from Rob

1557
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It's all over my foot

1558
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Alright

1559
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Dark Sakura the gay foot

1560
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Rob

1561
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Oh my god Dark Tetsuya said touch DS

1562
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That was funny

1563
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Anyway

1564
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So guess what we have

1565
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Wait a minute

1566
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Wait a minute

1567
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Did you just eat that sauce from McDonald's?

1568
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's fucking awesome I can't stop

1569
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Dude

1570
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I was like touching Dark Sakura's foot and I was like hee hee

1571
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And I was reaching out and I looked over and I swear

1572
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I saw Loki like drinking

1573
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
The sauce from McDonald's

1574
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I was because it's so tasty

1575
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Oh my god that's nasty

1576
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Sweet and sour sauce

1577
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I ran out of nuggets

1578
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Anyway

1579
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Are you one of those people that bitches at the drive through

1580
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Because they're like okay

1581
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
If you only get six nuggets

1582
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You only get one sweet and sour sauce

1583
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Pack and if you want more

1584
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You gotta pay ten cents extra

1585
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Do you get really upset about that because you like to drink them

1586
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Apparently

1587
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
No two's enough

1588
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
For like a ten piece nuggets

1589
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Or whatever but you know

1590
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
They gave me three so what the fuck am I supposed to

1591
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I can't just save it for next time

1592
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Think about it Rob that's like a shot for ten cents

1593
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Dude I mean

1594
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I take syrup shots I mean come on

1595
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Do you eat the jams

1596
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
At like waffle country waffles

1597
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Oh god

1598
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I don't like jam

1599
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Nasty nasty nasty

1600
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
You took syrup shots with everybody Rob

1601
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I'm gonna finish drinking this now

1602
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I was drunk

1603
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
At Roscoe's?

1604
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I don't know it's just my excuse for everything

1605
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Fine so guess what Sony's giving us

1606
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Food

1607
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Crabs? Aids?

1608
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Hot shots tennis

1609
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Oh I was gonna say shots

1610
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You can dress up the little girls in different costumes

1611
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
That's not very hot

1612
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It's hot shots

1613
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I guess it's supposed to be cute

1614
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yummy

1615
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So yeah hot shots tennis

1616
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yay next

1617
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I love your reporting DarkSakura

1618
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You don't even bother to give us

1619
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
The details you just like

1620
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah Sony's making a hot shots

1621
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Tennis game and you can dress chicks up

1622
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
But this game sucks

1623
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I can do that in Dead or Alive and then this one I get bouncing

1624
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Boobies so huh

1625
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Alright

1626
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Well of course

1627
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
E3 is coming to town of course

1628
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
It's coming to Santa Monica

1629
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Where exactly in town they haven't really said

1630
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
From what I understand they've kind of like told people

1631
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Okay be on the street corner

1632
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh yeah the invitations at the house I could have looked there

1633
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Well they're gonna tell you like be on the street corner

1634
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And then like an unmarked bus will come pick you up

1635
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And it's like going to a rave

1636
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Apparently is what E3 is tuned into

1637
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Like dude there's gonna be like this sweet party

1638
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
At this like vacated airport hangar

1639
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But like we can't tell you where it is on the flyer

1640
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
It's like an unmarked bus is gonna come pick you up

1641
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And take you to the location

1642
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's gonna be an all night party

1643
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
One of the E's now stands for Ecstasy

1644
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Apparently

1645
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It was like E4

1646
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
We're putting the E in E3

1647
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Well anyhow the interesting thing about E3

1648
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Is that last year there were 400 companies

1649
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Debuting stuff at E3 and showing off their latest stuff

1650
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
This year there are 32 companies

1651
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Showing off at this year's E3

1652
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Now granted Sony's on the list

1653
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Microsoft's on the list

1654
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And Nintendo's on the list

1655
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Because all the companies that are debuting stuff

1656
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Is a lot of the big big companies

1657
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Uh it's basically

1658
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Kenshi Hall was where you know

1659
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Where those 400 companies were last year

1660
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
But it's still kind of surprising there

1661
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
You just can't fit that many companies on an unmarked bus

1662
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I guess not

1663
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So uh

1664
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
The invitations are down by the way

1665
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
To between 3,000 and 4,000 compared to last year

1666
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
60,000

1667
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Is one of the companies that's gonna have a booth there

1668
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
G4 because you know they always have a booth

1669
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
No G4 is not on the exhibitors list

1670
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
But they will probably still somehow have like

1671
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
500 people

1672
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
At E3

1673
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
All in those ugly shirts

1674
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Well anyway

1675
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I realized Dark Sakura got an invite

1676
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
To E3 but

1677
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Have you even followed up on it?

1678
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I think you need to

1679
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I've been reading Twitter

1680
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I got my invite and I did my confirmation

1681
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So I've got my physical thing in the mail

1682
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Lucky you

1683
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Have fun, take pictures

1684
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Wait a minute

1685
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Loki and I are sitting here going

1686
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
God damn motherfucking E3

1687
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And you're like

1688
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Oh yeah I got an invite just kind of sitting at home

1689
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I don't know I may not go

1690
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I actually am putting my focus on my education

1691
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
So maybe

1692
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I don't know if people want to give me money I'll go

1693
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Cause it's kind of expensive to stay down there

1694
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I hope you're listening ESA

1695
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Fuckers

1696
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
This is when you're inviting people that don't want to go

1697
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I didn't say I don't want to go

1698
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I can't afford to go

1699
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
My name is Dark Sakura

1700
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
AKA Jamie Summers

1701
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And I think you should let me into E3

1702
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I'm really angry about things

1703
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Let me play your game god damn it

1704
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
No no

1705
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
If they would give me a place to stay

1706
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Then I would be happy

1707
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I just wear glasses do my hair

1708
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
And that little A style that Dark Sakura has hers

1709
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And I can sneak in as her

1710
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Yeah but you have to

1711
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I want to play your game does it have boobs

1712
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Whatever

1713
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Jamie could be a guys name

1714
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Whatever

1715
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Alright anyhow

1716
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
This is California it's high me

1717
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I'm sorry

1718
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Whatever

1719
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Well anyway every time I hear about E3

1720
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And how it's kind of going a little bit downhill

1721
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
And the fact that there's this big party going on

1722
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And I'm not invited

1723
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I get a little bit angsty

1724
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I know what that means

1725
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Dark Sakura would you care to start us off

1726
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
With the FUs of the week

1727
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Matthew of the week goes

1728
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It's very simple

1729
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Goes to stupid drama

1730
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
And it's fucking raining on me at Disneyland

1731
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
On my birthday

1732
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Hey dude the lines were short

1733
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
And the teacups were not being opened

1734
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
That was sad

1735
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And and and and and

1736
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
The hundred minute wait is Space Mountain

1737
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Fuckers

1738
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And and and and and

1739
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Yeah done

1740
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Loki

1741
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Fuck you to the dumbass that ran

1742
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Our games at Qsar last night

1743
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Because you are

1744
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
A dumb fucking

1745
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The job I mean because I've done the job

1746
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's not that fucking hard

1747
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And now you've failed at every aspect of it

1748
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And like when I was playing in front of him

1749
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
He was like mystified like I was doing magic

1750
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Or something you know

1751
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
So how are you doing that

1752
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Horrible

1753
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
The Qsar has really gone downhill in Vacaville

1754
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
All packs are all fucked up

1755
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So fuck them for screwing that up

1756
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I would like to give an FU to Loki's wife Nellie

1757
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
For shooting me fifty-eight times

1758
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
In one game at said Qsar

1759
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Because the

1760
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Dumbass who was running it forgot to turn on

1761
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
The defense shields so she could just shoot me

1762
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Over and over and over and over and over again

1763
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Which is what she did she just basically held the gun up to my back

1764
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And kept shooting because those

1765
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I could not shoot the base like something was wrong

1766
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
With those bases but I had a fun time

1767
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
At laser tag FU to Loki for not opening up his own

1768
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Laser tag arena for being too like

1769
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Oh yeah

1770
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Oh wait what's that

1771
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Oh it's twenty or it's

1772
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
You know two million dollars in my ass

1773
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
You know wow

1774
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Look at that

1775
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Get a loan or something I don't know

1776
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Rescue us from horrible Qsars around the world

1777
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Anyway what else do I have an FU too

1778
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I don't know

1779
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I guess that's it

1780
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Just an FU to Nellie

1781
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Warrior Bob any FUs you have to get off your chest

1782
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I'm actually a fairly happy guy

1783
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I don't have a whole lot of FUs

1784
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
So if anything it's to Sony for the drives

1785
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Not reading blue discs

1786
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Because that makes me angry

1787
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
And to Jobs for not being open for me

1788
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Because I'm unemployed

1789
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Unemployment sucks

1790
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I'm working on it

1791
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I know a lot of people who are unemployed right now it kind of sucks

1792
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Honestly blue discs make me more angry

1793
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
You should say

1794
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
An FU to the Rob D for sounding like you

1795
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I don't know it's kind of weird

1796
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
The Rob D sounds like me

1797
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Yes I don't know if you've ever listened to this day in gaming podcasts

1798
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
But you guys have a very similar voice it's kind of interesting

1799
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm going to have to go listen to that now

1800
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
It's interesting it's not a bad thing

1801
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
He's got a great radio voice

1802
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Well thank you very much

1803
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I sleep all night so I'm totally unconscious

1804
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I have no idea what I'm running around doing

1805
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Maybe we're the same guy

1806
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Well he's in chat right now though

1807
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I don't know if that's possible

1808
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Unless you're like that chick on Heroes

1809
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Who can use the internet with her brain

1810
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
That would be so distracting

1811
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
No I'm not like the chick on Heroes

1812
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And yeah that stupid bitch on Heroes

1813
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Fucking A

1814
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I sign up for the damn viral websites

1815
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And she spams me all this shit

1816
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
All the time

1817
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Had I known her secret power was spamming people

1818
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I wouldn't have fucking signed up on that goddamn viral site

1819
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
There's an F you

1820
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
F you to freaking spam bots getting into my forums

1821
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
F you to PHPBB

1822
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
For making it really hard for me to fix that

1823
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And F you to get into spam bots

1824
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And the other thing I hate fucking spam

1825
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
That has to do with the stock market

1826
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I don't play the stock market

1827
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Why the fuck would I care what companies

1828
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Want me to buy

1829
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Amanda sent me the best title though from a spam email

1830
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
You exemplify carrot

1831
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Whatever happened to Spamusement

1832
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
That was like my favorite online

1833
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Have there been updates?

1834
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
That was my favorite online comic

1835
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Anywhere with Spamusement

1836
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And they just kind of stopped doing updates

1837
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I mean I realized

1838
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Maybe the guy like you know real life

1839
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Comes first and maybe had something else he wanted to do

1840
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
That doesn't make me any less sad

1841
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
He could just pass it off to somebody

1842
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
No the last one was October 20th

1843
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
That makes me sad

1844
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Spamusement go look in the archives

1845
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
The older cartoons at Spamusement.com

1846
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's one of the greatest online comics I've ever read in my life

1847
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
It's great

1848
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Anyways

1849
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Oh god some of these are kind of gross

1850
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So there's going to be a brand new phone coming out

1851
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
From Mr. Bishi

1852
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It's a new Docomo

1853
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Sounds like Kokomo

1854
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Anyways D9-04i

1855
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And apparently

1856
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It's going to have a motion sensor built into it

1857
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Or I believe

1858
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
There was something about it using its camera

1859
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
To detect motion

1860
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Anyways

1861
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
It's a fucking Wii phone type thing

1862
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
And you're going to be able to use it to play games

1863
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And a couple of the games that are going to be coming out for it

1864
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Of course

1865
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Katamari Portable

1866
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And You Are Gundam

1867
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So I guess that's neat

1868
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
But I hope they don't release them in the US

1869
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Because

1870
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
People have enough trouble driving

1871
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Let alone playing TILTI games

1872
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
On their cell phone

1873
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Driving while side talking

1874
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
How about just shut up and drive

1875
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
That's what I vote for

1876
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And further proof that Namco intends to just

1877
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Poop all over the Katamari franchise

1878
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
While the creator has gone off to greener pastures

1879
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
But then you can roll it up into an even bigger ball

1880
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And set it on fire

1881
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
With your cell phone for god's sake

1882
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Roll it up and light it

1883
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
There we go

1884
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
New Katamari game, Katamari Weed

1885
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Katamari Weed

1886
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Wow, well anyway

1887
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
That's going to bring Segment A

1888
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio to a close here

1889
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And we'll be back after a quick break

1890
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

1891
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Because as you know we tape in two

1892
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Well maybe you don't know because we were gone last week

1893
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So maybe you need a little bit of a refresher

1894
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
But Orange Lounge Radio tapes in two halves

1895
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Live on Sunday night

1896
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And this first half will go out to our podcast feed immediately

1897
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And then the second half will follow sometime mid week

1898
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So we're going to take a break here

1899
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1900
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Thanks for watching and have a great week
