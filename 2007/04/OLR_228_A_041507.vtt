00:20.087 --> 00:22.227
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Parappa the Rapper set to get another sequel?

00:22.487 --> 00:23.968
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you mount for a mount?

00:27.228 --> 00:31.249

[SPEAKER_06]: Good, so far So far?

01:18.918 --> 01:23.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah But what might make things go bad tonight, just so I don't do it?

01:24.379 --> 01:32.701
[SPEAKER_06]: I need food, I only have two Pepsis to go off of, and I haven't had dinner yet Angry Loki needs food badly I'm not angry, I'm just hungry

01:33.926 --> 01:34.927
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't shoot food.

01:35.888 --> 01:36.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:36.648 --> 01:37.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's into my mouth.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.291
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Angry Loki is about to die.

01:41.892 --> 01:42.653
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Gauntlet.

01:42.973 --> 01:44.614
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously, they overdid Gauntlet.

01:44.934 --> 01:46.876
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I used to love Gauntlet, but not anymore.

01:47.256 --> 01:50.279
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, then we had the Midway Arcade Treasures Gauntlet.

01:50.299 --> 01:52.020
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had the Xbox Live Gauntlet.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.561
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we had, you know, it was overdone.

01:53.921 --> 01:55.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Gauntlet was good, but it wasn't that good.

01:55.462 --> 01:58.765
[SPEAKER_06]: It should have been like Gauntlet Legends and, you know,

01:59.383 --> 02:00.824
[SPEAKER_05]: Gauntlet Legends was pretty awesome.

02:00.844 --> 02:02.786
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't mind seeing that on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:03.026 --> 02:05.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that was a fun, like, actual arcade title.

02:05.168 --> 02:05.428
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:06.549 --> 02:07.290
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, anyway.

02:08.431 --> 02:13.255
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, where that podcast here every week.

02:13.295 --> 02:17.379
[SPEAKER_05]: We tape live Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:17.859 --> 02:21.182
[SPEAKER_05]: Heading into our sixth year, really, because our fifth birthday.

02:21.222 --> 02:22.683
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would be heading into your sixth year.

02:23.063 --> 02:26.086
[SPEAKER_05]: Our fifth birthday is coming up in June.

02:26.306 --> 02:27.167
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be exciting.

02:28.694 --> 02:30.255
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping to have a big show for that one.

02:30.595 --> 02:38.058
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had folks actually email us asking if they can come over for the big anniversary show.

02:39.518 --> 02:40.459
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make a suggestion.

02:40.719 --> 02:42.679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all over the floor.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.981
[SPEAKER_05]: You've probably got enough for a corpse.

02:46.741 --> 02:52.323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice gesture, but the problem is that Orange Lingerie kind of tapes in the spare bedroom of my place.

02:53.061 --> 02:58.363
[SPEAKER_05]: and as much as I'd like to have like, you know, 50 listeners over just to kind of hang, I don't know if the landlord would like that.

02:58.443 --> 03:12.868
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're thinking about, at least I'm kind of putting this out there, having a block party for OLR's fifth birthday, like somewhere else, like at Golfland or I don't care, Chuck E. Cheese, I don't give a shit.

03:12.928 --> 03:14.169
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a grill at my house.

03:14.209 --> 03:14.649
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not here.

03:15.029 --> 03:16.570
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to go to your house, have a barbecue?

03:16.670 --> 03:17.550
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a barbecue at my house.

03:17.570 --> 03:18.391
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Barbecue?

03:18.411 --> 03:20.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do an Orange Lounge Barbecue with pinball.

03:20.471 --> 03:22.192
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't care if strangers come to your house?

03:23.220 --> 03:24.680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just have to lock up everything in the vault.

03:24.780 --> 03:25.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

03:26.381 --> 03:28.241
[SPEAKER_05]: Hide Shermie.

03:28.261 --> 03:29.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Shermie will hide herself.

03:30.062 --> 03:30.302
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

03:31.182 --> 03:33.242
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, so more details on that to come.

03:33.503 --> 03:34.663
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be coming up in a couple months.

03:34.703 --> 03:36.123
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get to it.

03:36.323 --> 03:37.664
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start off with how was your gaming week?

03:38.504 --> 03:40.064
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

03:41.545 --> 03:44.745
[SPEAKER_03]: I yelled at Dan for not bringing back Marvel Ultimate Alliance again.

03:45.586 --> 03:49.246
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually... I played a lot of Cooking Mama while waiting at the bank.

03:50.507 --> 03:51.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Things I do for us.

03:52.813 --> 03:53.954
[SPEAKER_03]: The sacrifices I make.

03:55.055 --> 03:56.876
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned how to make tonkatsu.

03:57.357 --> 03:59.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you not played Cooking Mama on the Wii yet?

03:59.738 --> 04:00.679
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm broke.

04:00.859 --> 04:02.000
[SPEAKER_05]: You really should at some point.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.382
[SPEAKER_05]: Borrow mine, because I'm going to be gone for a week anyway.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.024
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game.

04:07.825 --> 04:08.025
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

04:08.545 --> 04:08.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuck.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wait.

04:10.887 --> 04:12.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Resident Evil, then Cooking Mama.

04:14.670 --> 04:16.712
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that is not Chris's blood.

04:18.793 --> 04:21.115
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.

04:21.816 --> 04:22.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

04:24.933 --> 04:25.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you?

04:26.114 --> 04:27.735
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

04:27.755 --> 04:32.018
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we need to do that for our fortune cookie if we still have it.

04:32.499 --> 04:35.701
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where the hell that... The Resident Evil porn thing.

04:35.721 --> 04:36.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, somebody sent me that.

04:36.942 --> 04:38.543
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a Resident Evil voice acting.

04:38.583 --> 04:39.564
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent it to you.

04:39.924 --> 04:41.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have deleted it, I'm sure.

04:42.125 --> 04:42.366
[SPEAKER_01]: Bitch.

04:42.486 --> 04:45.007
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a delete everything Jamie sent me button.

04:45.748 --> 04:47.809
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Jamie fills up my computer with crap.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.891
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to have a big pink button.

04:50.481 --> 04:51.122
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.

04:51.862 --> 04:52.783
[SPEAKER_02]: I send you awesome.

04:53.864 --> 04:54.264
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that it?

04:54.304 --> 04:55.285
[SPEAKER_05]: Cooking Mom, what was your gaming week?

04:57.066 --> 05:00.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that and damn let the PSP battery die.

05:00.549 --> 05:01.550
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't find the charger.

05:02.150 --> 05:03.311
[SPEAKER_03]: So, poo on him.

05:05.073 --> 05:06.354
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a game you didn't play.

05:09.256 --> 05:10.277
[SPEAKER_05]: Very well done, Jamie.

05:11.438 --> 05:12.078
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up!

05:13.019 --> 05:15.321
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you just got back from a road trip, right?

05:16.542 --> 05:17.983
[SPEAKER_05]: Angry drivers driving?

05:18.692 --> 05:21.895
[SPEAKER_05]: just stupid people alright, that's what I thought alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:22.795 --> 05:47.915
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Earth Defense Force 2017 per usual so that was fun I played briefly Guitar Hero 2 and that was about as fun as the first one in which case I'm probably not going to be playing much of it why the fuck I bought it it's beyond me same reason I bought DDR though I haven't really played much DDR either played Boom Boom Rocket

05:48.573 --> 05:49.153
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun.

05:51.354 --> 05:56.295
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I was doing pretty good on some of the songs, but they got pretty hard.

05:57.335 --> 05:58.856
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the achievements are actually pretty easy.

05:59.376 --> 06:02.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I unlocked five after playing the first song or something.

06:02.116 --> 06:02.557
[SPEAKER_06]: It was weird.

06:03.097 --> 06:16.220
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played Gnarly Golf, which that's an old Apple IIGS game that I played through an Apple IIGS emulator on the internet, and

06:16.969 --> 06:19.131
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss that game, except it's really crappy now.

06:19.531 --> 06:21.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Why that game of all games?

06:21.232 --> 06:22.854
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's a game I used to play a long time ago.

06:23.554 --> 06:24.215
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fun.

06:24.795 --> 06:26.156
[SPEAKER_06]: I remembered it being a lot more fun.

06:26.717 --> 06:30.820
[SPEAKER_06]: But the emulator didn't work right, so you never lose lives.

06:32.101 --> 06:35.003
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I beat the whole game, and I was like, this is dumb.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, let's see, what else did I play?

06:39.586 --> 06:41.188
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Super Paper Mario.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.511
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has way too much dialogue.

06:47.303 --> 06:49.325
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 minutes of fucking dialogue before I can play the game.

06:49.885 --> 06:50.645
[SPEAKER_06]: That's retarded.

06:52.006 --> 06:54.028
[SPEAKER_06]: But, it's okay so far.

06:56.329 --> 06:57.270
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I play?

06:57.290 --> 07:01.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's about it, I think.

07:02.573 --> 07:02.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

07:03.894 --> 07:04.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

07:04.154 --> 07:05.976
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

07:06.056 --> 07:06.556
[SPEAKER_05]: My Game of Week.

07:07.406 --> 07:09.567
[SPEAKER_05]: I also play Super Paper Mario a lot.

07:09.947 --> 07:11.048
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.

07:11.168 --> 07:12.168
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's an awesome game.

07:13.409 --> 07:18.251
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the whole old school side scroller thing mixed with the role playing elements.

07:18.911 --> 07:21.072
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that 3D thing is freaking brilliant.

07:21.313 --> 07:24.314
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the fact that you can hit the button and suddenly you're in the 3D world.

07:24.895 --> 07:25.436
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:47.435 --> 07:47.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

08:08.311 --> 08:09.212
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree with you, Loki.

08:09.312 --> 08:10.533
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the dialogue is cool.

08:10.893 --> 08:18.178
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the dialogue was cool, it's just I didn't really care for 20 minutes of it right in the beginning of the game, you know what I mean?

08:18.418 --> 08:19.979
[SPEAKER_06]: Why didn't you just skip the opening wedding thing?

08:19.999 --> 08:25.723
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I wanted to know the story, because obviously it's there if it's important.

08:26.344 --> 08:34.089
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so, I just wish they would have, like, you know, paraphrased or maybe broken it up a little bit, you know, instead of...

08:34.690 --> 09:02.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, you get to play a little bit Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah So That's like any Final Fantasy game, seriously Final Fantasy has less fucking dialogue than this goddamn game This game just beats everything out I mean, seriously, Final Fantasy At least there's dialogue, but there's stuff happening Instead of just Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, look, it's, you know It's like the start of Final Fantasy 7 It's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Okay, run here

09:03.188 --> 09:04.249
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:04.349 --> 09:05.049
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, run here.

09:05.149 --> 09:09.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, at least I get to fucking control my character within the first 20 minutes of the game.

09:10.192 --> 09:15.674
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, though, why the fuck is the storyline almost like ripped from Sonic the Hedgehog?

09:15.774 --> 09:22.798
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you have to collect these, like, jewel things or whatever to, you know, get the Chaos Heart.

09:22.918 --> 09:24.299
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

09:24.319 --> 09:25.459
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think of that.

09:25.479 --> 09:27.120
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.

09:27.661 --> 09:28.741
[SPEAKER_06]: So, whatever.

09:28.781 --> 09:29.301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll play the game.

09:29.341 --> 09:30.082
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be awesome.

09:30.722 --> 09:32.203
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, but it's just...

09:32.890 --> 09:35.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, you need to space up the dialogue a little bit more.

09:35.351 --> 09:39.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, always the fourth guest here on the program.

09:40.874 --> 09:44.455
[SPEAKER_05]: Duckator says, if Loki wanted to know the story, then why is he complaining?

09:46.416 --> 09:49.117
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit says, Loki is just upset he has to read for a change.

09:49.778 --> 09:54.280
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like fucking Stephen King, you know, wrote the goddamn Super Paper Mario.

09:54.380 --> 09:54.760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like...

09:55.484 --> 09:57.245
[SPEAKER_06]: And Luigi came, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:57.285 --> 10:03.727
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Stephen King just writes about nothing for pages at a time, and then there's actual plot going on, and it's about nothing.

10:03.787 --> 10:12.171
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, okay, and then the characters are about to get attacked, when all of a sudden, my attention was drawn away by a butterfly, and I'm going to go down the street and find out what goes down there.

10:12.191 --> 10:14.752
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference is that he gets paid a lot of money to go off on tangents.

10:15.012 --> 10:15.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

10:16.273 --> 10:16.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid.

10:16.773 --> 10:17.833
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's all right.

10:18.193 --> 10:21.115
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten past dialogue now, so awesome.

10:21.175 --> 10:22.115
[SPEAKER_06]: Just need super...

10:22.970 --> 10:26.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario RPG to come to Virtual Console and we'll be all good.

10:26.491 --> 10:28.251
[SPEAKER_02]: I just bought that for $3.

10:29.411 --> 10:30.391
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the original cartridge, right?

10:30.411 --> 10:30.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

10:30.911 --> 10:31.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd you find that?

10:31.912 --> 10:34.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone traded it in at Dan's store, so he bought it.

10:35.092 --> 10:35.632
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, lucky you.

10:35.672 --> 10:38.053
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that'll be out... You think that'll come out on Virtual Console?

10:38.193 --> 10:43.193
[SPEAKER_05]: I would've thought they would've put that out around the time that Super Paper Mario... Well, actually, or putting out Paper Mario, I don't know.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the game's awesome.

10:46.614 --> 10:47.754
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to Loki's rants.

10:47.894 --> 10:48.454
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tolerable.

10:48.514 --> 10:51.555
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say it wasn't awesome, I just said there's a lot of fucking dialogue in it.

10:51.595 --> 10:52.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, great.

10:53.807 --> 10:56.629
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're okay with reading, then it won't bother you.

10:56.749 --> 10:57.649
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to read.

10:57.709 --> 11:01.571
[SPEAKER_05]: I play video games, so I don't have to read that much.

11:01.871 --> 11:10.394
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I think is going to be a problem for the game is that once I beat it, I don't really see it as being the type of game I'm going to go back through and play again a lot.

11:10.755 --> 11:12.375
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess you could say the same thing about Final Fantasy.

11:12.395 --> 11:18.458
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, Final Fantasy always had a lot of side stories and things to collect, and although Paper Mario has, I guess, those cards or whatever...

11:18.925 --> 11:19.265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

11:19.465 --> 11:22.687
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of see it as something I'm going to play once and be done with.

11:22.967 --> 11:23.408
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll see.

11:23.488 --> 11:23.788
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

11:24.388 --> 11:25.309
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask me again when I get there.

11:27.290 --> 11:30.632
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a phenomenal game for the 20, 30 hours I'll spend playing it.

11:32.593 --> 11:34.174
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, my game of the week, Boom Boom Rocket.

11:34.874 --> 11:40.298
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only game I've ever played where I found myself in the top 10 on the Xbox leaderboards.

11:40.338 --> 11:47.682
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I'm there anymore, and I should have taken a picture of it because, you know, hey, it makes my internet-y penis feel big that I was in the top 10 of the leaderboards.

11:47.947 --> 11:51.468
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I went into the medium leaderboard, and I was like, number five, one day.

11:51.948 --> 11:55.909
[SPEAKER_05]: But, and I know you might be thinking, well, medium, well, why don't you impress me on the hard leaderboard?

11:55.949 --> 12:06.852
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was trying to get that achievement where you get A's on all ten medium songs, so I was just playing, and I guess that's the default leaderboard that your scores that you see in the main Blades page comes from.

12:07.192 --> 12:12.633
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have this insanely high score somehow, which is weird, because I did not get 100% perfects on all the songs.

12:12.813 --> 12:13.854
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know, whatever.

12:14.354 --> 12:14.914
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, um...

12:15.950 --> 12:20.014
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I've just been playing rhythm games so long that it really didn't take me long to get accustomed to Boom Boom Rocket.

12:20.354 --> 12:25.619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically DDR with erratic paths that the arrows take to get to the line.

12:26.119 --> 12:29.502
[SPEAKER_05]: The song list in Boom Boom Rocket, though, seriously, it sucks.

12:30.063 --> 12:37.089
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all classical remade tunes, and I think maybe like two of them are good, and the rest of the songs, I won't want to play again.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.550
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked actually some of them.

12:38.610 --> 12:41.693
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one that was like a drum and bass remix, and that was pretty awesome.

12:42.214 --> 12:42.494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

12:43.402 --> 12:49.754
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to just hook up a DDR pad because, to be honest, I'm like, these patterns aren't that hard, but why can't I fucking hit them on the controller?

12:50.356 --> 12:51.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck this shit.

12:51.077 --> 12:52.079
[SPEAKER_06]: I should just put a pad in there.

12:52.878 --> 12:56.700
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, somebody asked me, sent me a message if you could play the game with a DDR pad.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.261
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure, I haven't tried it.

12:58.321 --> 12:59.042
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can.

12:59.082 --> 12:59.702
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't you?

12:59.842 --> 13:02.283
[SPEAKER_05]: The DDR pad is just a substitute for the directional buttons.

13:02.464 --> 13:04.465
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason you couldn't do it.

13:04.665 --> 13:07.286
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can play Boom Boom Rocket with the D-pad or the buttons.

13:07.586 --> 13:08.667
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is actually how I do it.

13:08.747 --> 13:09.347
[SPEAKER_05]: I use both.

13:10.188 --> 13:13.110
[SPEAKER_05]: I use left on the D-pad and then the other three I use the buttons.

13:13.130 --> 13:14.771
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that allows me to have the triggers as well.

13:15.071 --> 13:16.912
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes a little bit of getting used to, but seriously, try it.

13:17.212 --> 13:19.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do all direction or don't do all buttons.

13:20.174 --> 13:20.574
[SPEAKER_05]: Do like...

13:21.552 --> 13:24.694
[SPEAKER_05]: One or two of the arrows on the direction pad and then the other two on the buttons.

13:24.794 --> 13:27.556
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you play a couple easy songs to get used to it, you'll be fine.

13:28.856 --> 13:32.659
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one that confused me that actually had like four buttons come up at once.

13:33.999 --> 13:34.239
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.900
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, um, okay.

13:36.961 --> 13:38.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you wouldn't be able to do that on a dance pad.

13:38.962 --> 13:41.784
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it was up, up, and left, left.

13:42.924 --> 13:43.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

13:43.485 --> 13:46.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then you probably, yeah, you probably just have to do what I'm doing there.

13:46.807 --> 13:48.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit left on D-pad and left on the button.

13:48.648 --> 13:49.008
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I...

13:49.645 --> 13:51.967
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I do remember seeing that, but I got around somehow.

13:51.987 --> 13:54.869
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I only played the game really for one night.

13:55.189 --> 13:56.510
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it hardcore one night.

13:56.550 --> 13:57.231
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it for hours.

13:57.331 --> 13:59.533
[SPEAKER_05]: But the songs just aren't replayable for me.

13:59.593 --> 14:03.295
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the difference between Boom Boom Rocket and DDR or Beatmania.

14:03.596 --> 14:06.798
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take Beatmania, which obviously this game is hugely inspired by.

14:08.439 --> 14:11.642
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania has songs that are easily replayable over and over again.

14:12.102 --> 14:16.486
[SPEAKER_05]: And Konami obviously has some great in-house artists to create a lot of original songs.

14:16.866 --> 14:18.327
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, they license stuff.

14:18.752 --> 14:22.793
[SPEAKER_05]: but in the Japanese versions it's all J-pop crap none of us care about anyway.

14:22.993 --> 14:23.974
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, maybe a little bit.

14:24.634 --> 14:25.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a little guilty pleasure side.

14:26.354 --> 14:28.075
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of it is forgettable, right?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.036
[SPEAKER_05]: But the original in-house stuff is great.

14:30.116 --> 14:34.717
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Naoki, Taka, Akira Yamaoka, they all create great stuff.

14:34.737 --> 14:40.739
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't believe a big company like EA does not have in-house artists that are capable of creating music.

14:40.759 --> 14:46.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus they license all that rock music junk for burnouts and all that stuff anyway.

14:46.101 --> 14:46.321
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Tracks.

14:46.541 --> 14:47.241
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Tracks.

14:47.768 --> 14:48.349
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

14:48.469 --> 14:50.411
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't we have had some of that on Boom Boom Rocket?

14:50.631 --> 14:52.994
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that just because maybe it was a risky project?

14:53.274 --> 14:53.514
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

14:53.534 --> 14:55.296
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because there's downloadable packs later.

14:55.656 --> 14:56.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

14:56.437 --> 15:05.567
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, bend me over and charge me up the wazoo for expandable packs that are, you know, not even going to be that great, I'm sure.

15:05.807 --> 15:07.429
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's probably going to be just like Guitar Hero.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.270
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into that later.

15:12.436 --> 15:37.368
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chat says EA tracks for the lose SSJ100Matt says fucking Avril DarkShy says no insult J-pop it's not all bad but come on some of it's pretty forgettable I like Mflow they're pretty cool third style for life alright anyhow let's get into some housekeeping for tonight if everyone's done with their gaming week

15:38.018 --> 15:39.919
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's housekeeping, not a lot.

15:39.999 --> 15:51.606
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to give a cheap plug for the All Games community site, which is something we've kind of put our might behind as well in endorsing the All Games.

15:51.666 --> 15:54.927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like MySpace, but without the cam bots and whores and stuff.

15:55.408 --> 15:57.109
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's people talking about video games.

15:57.729 --> 15:58.309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty awesome.

15:58.349 --> 16:02.572
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to visit it, it's community.allgames.com, and all three of us have profiles on there.

16:02.912 --> 16:04.693
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on there, DarkSakura's on there, Matt's on there.

16:05.109 --> 16:12.895
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd actually like you to check out, if you have a chance, I just wrote an article called the Top 10 Edutainment Titles of All Time.

16:13.595 --> 16:17.758
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you might remember last week I talked about how I went to Monterey and I played an educational tide pool game.

16:18.038 --> 16:19.339
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of got me thinking this week.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.683
[SPEAKER_05]: What are my favorite edutainment games from yesteryear?

16:24.703 --> 16:26.464
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, number one is The Oregon Trail.

16:26.825 --> 16:28.626
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll leave you to figure out what the other nine are.

16:28.646 --> 16:28.986
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

16:31.684 --> 16:32.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fuck.

16:57.096 --> 16:57.737
[SPEAKER_07]: Timeworks Inc.

16:57.757 --> 16:58.858
[SPEAKER_05]: made this for the Commodore 64.

17:17.788 --> 17:36.958
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically you went around this cave and you had to jump over rocks and you were collecting crystals and you had to avoid bats and rocks and if you messed up then you lost a bandaid well randomly in this like flash of light like like the little cheesy Commodore 64 sound effects this little wizard would appear and he'd go spell

17:37.757 --> 17:41.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Anti-disestablishmentarianism or whatever word, because it used the voice chip in there, right?

17:42.181 --> 17:45.624
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'd have to spell it out and hope you heard him right, because the voice chip kind of sucked.

17:45.664 --> 17:46.244
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a competition.

17:46.284 --> 17:50.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be like, now... It's Tricky Otomy Man!

17:51.449 --> 17:55.732
[SPEAKER_00]: Now spell... Uh-oh.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.154
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you got it right, he would give you a band-aid.

17:58.635 --> 18:02.838
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you got it wrong, he'd go, it's getting darker.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.820
[SPEAKER_05]: And he'd take flashlight power from you.

18:05.270 --> 18:06.831
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, do you guys ever post to your blogs?

18:06.891 --> 18:07.812
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen Loki post a few things.

18:07.872 --> 18:07.952
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

18:08.072 --> 18:09.413
[SPEAKER_05]: I put pictures of my cat up there.

18:09.433 --> 18:14.216
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki posted something a couple weeks ago that just hit the rest of the internet this week, but

18:34.133 --> 18:35.014
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:56.542 --> 18:58.363
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:25.627 --> 19:26.708
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo ran out of trees?

19:26.728 --> 19:28.230
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

19:48.047 --> 19:51.369
[SPEAKER_06]: It's impossible to find this stuff, and the controllers and all that stuff.

19:51.429 --> 19:56.912
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't understand why these controllers are any harder to make than, say, I don't know, the classic controller or whatnot.

19:57.413 --> 20:01.495
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not that complicated of a piece of equipment.

20:02.016 --> 20:04.077
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't understand why it's taking them so long.

20:04.097 --> 20:05.598
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't need those cards anyway.

20:05.758 --> 20:06.698
[SPEAKER_05]: The cards are pointless.

20:06.718 --> 20:08.199
[SPEAKER_05]: You get charged tax on those cards.

20:08.299 --> 20:09.240
[SPEAKER_05]: Buy them online.

20:09.440 --> 20:09.760
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

20:09.780 --> 20:14.183
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get charged tax as long as you're not in a state that will screw you over on it.

20:14.203 --> 20:17.545
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, but, you know, there's... Pennsylvania or whatever state's charged for that.

20:18.132 --> 20:23.714
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people like the cards, you know, for, say, I don't know, the kids that don't have credit cards or stuff like that.

20:24.354 --> 20:25.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Allowance bonus thing.

20:25.414 --> 20:26.674
[SPEAKER_06]: Steal your mommy's wallet.

20:27.235 --> 20:40.838
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just, this is just an example, though, basically, of how even the smallest things they're sold out of right now, you know, something that should be able, and so if it's a production issue, I mean, I don't see why they can't ship more of these cards.

20:40.858 --> 20:42.459
[SPEAKER_06]: These things should be fucking easy to make.

20:43.019 --> 20:43.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Same with the controllers.

20:43.739 --> 20:46.140
[SPEAKER_06]: The controllers aren't that complicated.

20:46.547 --> 20:56.253
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, hell, even the classic controller doesn't really have any major parts in it that weren't in, say, the GameCube or something like that.

20:56.693 --> 20:59.095
[SPEAKER_06]: The GameCube controllers, why the fuck can't they make more of them?

21:00.075 --> 21:01.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're made from magic trees.

21:02.237 --> 21:03.778
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, well there you go.

21:04.858 --> 21:06.339
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, magic trees.

21:06.359 --> 21:10.662
[SPEAKER_05]: Miyamoto has to handpick each tree that will become the cardboard used for Wii Points cars.

21:11.308 --> 21:12.990
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're going to have in Animal Crossing.

21:13.030 --> 21:16.593
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to plant the trees that they'll use to make those stupid points cards out of.

21:17.594 --> 21:20.216
[SPEAKER_06]: Shake the trees and then the magical point cards will fall out.

21:20.657 --> 21:21.958
[SPEAKER_02]: They could just recycle.

21:22.819 --> 21:24.120
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they have a bunch of stuff.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.923
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie will come to my village and chop all the trees down, I'm sure.

21:27.023 --> 21:27.383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

21:28.104 --> 21:29.525
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what probably happened.

21:29.645 --> 21:36.672
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone came into their village, chopped down all the magic trees that produce these stupid cards, and that's why they're gone.

21:37.253 --> 21:38.434
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:00.134 --> 22:05.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I hate to derail here, but Miklatov has joined us, and he's come in the room, and he's laughing his ass off.

22:05.039 --> 22:06.861
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you guys are playing video games out there.

22:07.322 --> 22:12.887
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, like, Miklatov, Extifer, and RicePrincess are all here, but none of them wanted to come on the show tonight because they're too cool for you.

22:13.288 --> 22:16.651
[SPEAKER_05]: But what is so goddamn funny that you guys, I hear you laughing up a storm out there.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's distracting.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.854
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to do a show in here.

22:19.695 --> 22:22.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Christopher is playing Marble Mania.

22:23.588 --> 22:24.830
[SPEAKER_04]: and Coro Impa.

22:24.950 --> 22:26.613
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in test at my office.

22:26.673 --> 22:27.193
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I saw it.

22:27.214 --> 22:28.015
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really fun game.

22:28.055 --> 22:28.716
[SPEAKER_04]: It is really fun.

22:29.176 --> 22:30.158
[SPEAKER_04]: He picked the panda.

22:30.791 --> 22:37.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel, and if people don't know about this game, every time the marble rolls, it makes noises, and if it runs into things or falls down, it makes noises.

22:37.715 --> 22:39.156
[SPEAKER_04]: The panda sounds like it's farting.

22:39.176 --> 22:44.019
[SPEAKER_04]: And it runs into things, and it's the funniest thing ever.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.362
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm dying of laughter out there, and Christopher can't play because I'm laughing so hard.

22:48.722 --> 22:51.244
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys are laughing at fart noises.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.565
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's derailing this entire show.

22:53.605 --> 22:58.929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this cute little panda, and it's farting constantly as it rolls.

23:03.446 --> 23:04.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't die!

23:04.327 --> 23:05.768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all that eucalyptus, you know.

23:06.348 --> 23:07.208
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gassy shit.

23:09.969 --> 23:12.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Pandas eat bamboo, you dipshit!

23:14.752 --> 23:17.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is what I get for not reading.

23:19.254 --> 23:20.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Bamboo, whatever!

23:20.454 --> 23:21.094
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gassy.

23:22.535 --> 23:26.397
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking give a shit if they're eating eucalyptus or bamboo.

23:27.492 --> 23:29.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's your problem.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.133
[SPEAKER_05]: You're feeding the panda eucalyptus.

23:33.694 --> 23:35.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank God I don't work at a zoo.

23:35.294 --> 23:36.294
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be dead.

23:37.855 --> 23:40.056
[SPEAKER_05]: The chatroom is asking if it's... Koala Panda!

23:41.116 --> 23:43.757
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Dark Knight's asking in chat, is it 420 this week?

23:44.257 --> 23:44.777
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're not.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.438
[SPEAKER_05]: We're role models for the young kids.

23:47.518 --> 23:49.118
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't do that here at Orange Lunch Radio.

23:49.158 --> 23:53.779
[SPEAKER_05]: That's only... Or what is the whole FBI thing that showed up before Final Fight?

23:54.239 --> 23:55.220
[SPEAKER_05]: Winners don't use drugs.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.160
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that, boys and girls.

23:57.718 --> 24:06.122
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, winners do find fun things on the internet, and now you will have the Nintendo Wii Opera browser to check out the internet with.

24:06.242 --> 24:08.864
[SPEAKER_05]: The final version has gone online this week.

24:08.904 --> 24:15.347
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have gotten the little blue light of love, as I call it, because, you know, when the blue light goes off on the Wii, you know somebody loves you.

24:16.167 --> 24:19.309
[SPEAKER_05]: But in this case, it was Nintendo saying, hey, it's ready for download.

24:19.329 --> 24:21.470
[SPEAKER_05]: So the full version of the internet channel is there.

24:22.591 --> 24:27.173
[SPEAKER_05]: The new features is, thank God, that little bar at the bottom of the screen will now auto-hide.

24:27.193 --> 24:30.875
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to enable it as a feature, but you can get rid of that so you can have your YouTube's full screen.

24:30.895 --> 24:32.917
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also just hit one and it'll hide it.

24:33.357 --> 24:33.637
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

24:34.177 --> 24:36.919
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also zoom in and out at a lot.

24:37.619 --> 24:43.442
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed when I was on YouTube, I could zoom in a lot smaller portions at a time.

24:43.702 --> 24:49.746
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really easy to get the video in the center of the screen without having to worry about trying to get it full screen and da-da-da and all that stuff.

24:50.834 --> 24:55.157
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also do www.com at a click of a button because all that's in there.

24:55.277 --> 24:58.400
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they just kind of gave it a little bit of a visual makeover as well.

24:58.420 --> 25:00.601
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to run a little faster, although I don't know.

25:01.322 --> 25:06.526
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's something about maybe the way my router's set up or the Wi-Fi, but Internet Channel is slow.

25:07.433 --> 25:08.994
[SPEAKER_05]: So slow.

25:09.074 --> 25:11.475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's faster to browse the internet on my PSP.

25:11.995 --> 25:15.457
[SPEAKER_05]: It's faster to browse the internet on, you know, obviously a computer.

25:15.717 --> 25:18.559
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the Wii, it is so tremendously slow.

25:18.619 --> 25:21.020
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't understand why the Wii is so much slower.

25:21.060 --> 25:22.921
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it just not have the power to handle or what?

25:22.981 --> 25:29.644
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just like I tried, I don't know, loading up even the weather channel or forecast channel or whatever.

25:30.264 --> 25:32.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of the channels, it takes fucking forever to load up.

25:33.626 --> 25:35.747
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just slow.

25:37.159 --> 25:40.842
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I supposed to, like, I don't know, enable some port in my router?

25:41.002 --> 25:50.129
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know how for some file share programs you're supposed to open up certain ports in your router, right, and direct them directly to one of the, you know, things that is connected to the router?

25:50.149 --> 25:50.569
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

25:51.270 --> 25:54.432
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, maybe I'm supposed to do that for the Wii to make it run faster.

25:54.512 --> 25:54.852
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

25:55.693 --> 25:55.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh.

25:57.574 --> 26:00.056
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe you have to just, like, grease it or something.

26:00.356 --> 26:02.398
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I just have to feed it eucalyptus.

26:02.758 --> 26:05.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to feed it eucalyptus leaves and turn it into a koala.

26:06.401 --> 26:06.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

26:07.196 --> 26:08.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some... Whatever.

26:08.637 --> 26:12.320
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit about fucking koalas.

26:13.882 --> 26:14.782
[SPEAKER_06]: Koalas are cute.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.725
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be a lot cuter than a fucking panda, I can tell you that much.

26:17.745 --> 26:20.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Koalas are cuter than pandas, because they have those big noses.

26:21.468 --> 26:31.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, speaking of things that have nothing to do with a big nose, for those who have their wheeze and are keeping up with virtual console releases, there is a...

26:33.598 --> 26:37.841
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if everybody's aware of this, but ActRaiser is out on a virtual console.

26:38.782 --> 26:40.123
[SPEAKER_03]: We love some ActRaiser, don't we?

26:40.764 --> 26:41.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in this country.

26:42.385 --> 26:43.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's exactly it.

26:43.566 --> 26:44.367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out in the UK.

26:46.489 --> 26:48.130
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually has 800 Wii Points.

26:50.792 --> 26:54.896
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it's the same old Super Nintendo game where you walk around and you're God.

26:55.796 --> 26:56.977
[SPEAKER_03]: I like walking around as God.

26:56.997 --> 26:57.658
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that every day.

26:58.828 --> 27:01.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Actraiser is seriously one of my favorite games ever from the Super Nintendo.

27:02.811 --> 27:05.353
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredible soundtrack, incredible gameplay.

27:05.593 --> 27:09.697
[SPEAKER_03]: I like smiting my enemies.

27:10.578 --> 27:15.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Also out for Virtual Console is Pac-Man for the NES for 500 Wii Points.

27:17.003 --> 27:21.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Bonk's Revenge for TurboGrafx-16 at 600 Wii Points.

27:22.748 --> 27:23.328
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah.

27:23.368 --> 27:24.289
[SPEAKER_05]: All I heard was Actraiser.

27:24.730 --> 27:25.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.

27:26.195 --> 27:27.096
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:46.914 --> 27:51.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Pac-Man is almost like Linux, because you can play Pac-Man on everything.

27:52.278 --> 27:54.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the Atari 5200 version, which is unplayable.

27:55.180 --> 27:55.660
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, 2600.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.903
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, the 2600 version is like... Crap!

27:59.963 --> 28:01.084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Pac-Man barf.

28:01.164 --> 28:02.425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not real Pac-Man.

28:02.865 --> 28:04.146
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it's not Pac-Man.

28:04.626 --> 28:05.687
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Diet Pac-Man.

28:07.348 --> 28:07.808
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways...

28:09.588 --> 28:15.373
[SPEAKER_06]: So, other games coming to Virtual Console, Sonic 2 and Shining Force.

28:15.854 --> 28:22.459
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been spotted on the Virtual Console servers, and they're expected to be out probably Monday.

28:23.160 --> 28:29.585
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we'll have to see if that actually happens, but they're there, and that's usually a good indicator that they're coming out Monday.

28:30.786 --> 28:34.850
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Prince is in chat and says, Actraiser will be coming out this or next week.

28:35.110 --> 28:36.872
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, maybe that's a good sign that...

28:37.697 --> 28:42.679
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this, uh, um, Actraiser, or the, the UK release will mirror the release that we get.

28:42.699 --> 28:43.860
[SPEAKER_05]: But we already got Pac-Man, right?

28:43.880 --> 28:46.181
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we already got Pac-Man.

28:46.201 --> 28:48.442
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, not, not that I really care, because I'm not gonna go down.

28:48.502 --> 28:49.322
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe we'll get Ms.

28:49.362 --> 28:50.342
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man or some bullshit.

28:50.783 --> 28:52.043
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care, I just want Actraiser.

28:52.223 --> 28:53.204
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the fucking original games.

28:54.784 --> 28:56.065
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be nice to have someday, wouldn't it?

28:56.465 --> 28:57.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally made games?

28:58.086 --> 28:58.506
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we'll see.

28:58.686 --> 28:59.246
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday.

28:59.566 --> 29:01.267
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

29:01.307 --> 29:05.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see, also, uh, speaking about Nintendo, oh, you're gonna love this story, Loki.

29:06.296 --> 29:08.477
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you love piracy, but Nintendo does not.

29:09.558 --> 29:12.259
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know that recently in the news, the U.S.

29:12.979 --> 29:15.560
[SPEAKER_05]: has complained to the World Trade Organization about China.

29:16.081 --> 29:21.123
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because piracy is running rampant throughout China.

29:21.923 --> 29:27.686
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo put out a press release earlier this week, on the 10th, saying that they support this.

29:29.166 --> 29:32.468
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo, of course, they lose money a lot because of piracy.

29:33.232 --> 29:36.414
[SPEAKER_05]: What I kind of find surprising, well, first, let me read the quote here.

29:36.714 --> 29:38.915
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, Nintendo will continue to work with the U.S.

29:38.955 --> 29:42.376
[SPEAKER_05]: government while aggressively pursuing counterfeit Nintendo products in China.

29:42.937 --> 29:43.817
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pleased the U.S.

29:43.857 --> 29:50.040
[SPEAKER_05]: government is pushing China to comply with its trade commitments in an effort to protect the lifeblood of the copyright and trademark industries.

29:50.060 --> 29:55.102
[SPEAKER_05]: That quote coming from Jody Doherty, Nintendo of America Senior Director of Anti-Piracy.

29:56.643 --> 29:58.224
[SPEAKER_05]: What's kind of interesting about that, though, is that, you know,

29:58.843 --> 30:03.226
[SPEAKER_05]: Their ROMs and their old shit still run rampant throughout the internet.

30:03.246 --> 30:05.087
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't really shut a lot of sites down.

30:05.348 --> 30:08.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the really, really big ones get shut down, but not really by Nintendo.

30:08.650 --> 30:10.451
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty easy to find Nintendo ROMs.

30:10.711 --> 30:13.453
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, there's that one site where you can play all the video games online.

30:15.355 --> 30:15.735
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

30:15.755 --> 30:17.656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like everyvideogame.com or something like that.

30:17.676 --> 30:19.017
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play them all right there in your browser.

30:19.798 --> 30:27.203
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo certainly has an interest in old games because they're making five bucks off of every one they can sell to a virtual console user.

30:28.104 --> 30:28.424
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

30:28.800 --> 30:33.224
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD in chat says, ROM sites don't really exist anymore, it's mostly torrents.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.126
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, somebody's hosting the torrents, right?

30:51.741 --> 30:52.961
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to host a seat file somewhere.

30:53.562 --> 30:55.062
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on where it's legal or illegal.

30:55.282 --> 30:56.843
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember all the crap with Pirate Bay.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Pirate Bay just says back and go, you guys are stupid.

31:00.244 --> 31:03.845
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw says, Sky, you're talking about virtualnes.com.

31:06.506 --> 31:08.067
[SPEAKER_05]: So we all know Tiger Claw is a big pirate.

31:11.568 --> 31:15.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is actually something that's, I think, pretty cool.

31:15.829 --> 31:17.150
[SPEAKER_03]: The company, Daytel, has...

31:18.237 --> 31:26.920
[SPEAKER_03]: A program for the PC where you can create, manage, and alter your Mii avatar for your PC.

31:30.282 --> 31:35.804
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually £14.99 and $19.99 in the US.

31:36.564 --> 31:38.505
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can download it off of their site.

31:39.225 --> 31:40.526
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at Code Junkies.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.687
[SPEAKER_03]: And the website is...

31:44.693 --> 31:45.374
[SPEAKER_03]: WII Mod WII.com

32:05.680 --> 32:06.640
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:26.897 --> 32:27.938
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:56.854 --> 33:00.996
[SPEAKER_05]: What a little cock tease that was, having a little DS there in the game, thinking there was going to be some type of functionality.

33:02.176 --> 33:10.340
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, thanks to the magic of radio, I just ran out to the living room real quick, and I saw them playing Korowimpa Marble Mania, and the farting panda's really fucking funny.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.101
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is funny.

33:12.141 --> 33:17.583
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like when the dog walks across the stones in Labyrinth, the Bog of Eternal Stench.

33:17.964 --> 33:19.805
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that, where it just farting noises all the time?

33:19.945 --> 33:22.066
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

33:22.086 --> 33:22.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you never seen Labyrinth?

33:23.362 --> 33:25.184
[SPEAKER_04]: The Rods of Eternal Stench!

33:25.304 --> 33:26.325
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

33:26.345 --> 33:27.746
[SPEAKER_05]: So bad!

33:28.106 --> 33:29.568
[SPEAKER_05]: The last time I saw it, I was like eight.

33:30.328 --> 33:31.329
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a couple months old.

33:31.349 --> 33:32.530
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to fix that!

33:33.231 --> 33:33.792
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

33:33.852 --> 33:35.233
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Megzy hasn't seen Labyrinth.

33:37.955 --> 33:44.561
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, something else that kind of stinks is the Circuit City Paper Mario guarantee.

33:45.462 --> 33:46.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically...

33:46.835 --> 33:59.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Their guarantee, at least in print, was that if you arrive at the store, if Super Paper Mario is not in the store street date by 2 p.m., then you get $20 in a gift card.

33:59.865 --> 34:04.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the problem was someone actually went there and saw that Super Paper Mario was sold out.

34:06.251 --> 34:12.115
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, the thing was they had Super Paper Mario in earlier, so therefore they don't get $20.

34:12.636 --> 34:14.097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like, well, we had it.

34:14.775 --> 34:15.695
[SPEAKER_05]: But you just weren't here.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.916
[SPEAKER_05]: What was to stop them from telling everybody that?

34:19.476 --> 34:19.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

34:21.777 --> 34:22.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing at all.

34:23.258 --> 34:23.598
[SPEAKER_05]: Aha!

34:24.418 --> 34:25.298
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a scam.

34:25.838 --> 34:26.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

34:26.279 --> 34:30.100
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he call the Better Business Bureau or did he just post his angry... Angry?

34:31.600 --> 34:32.781
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm thinking about the farting panda.

34:33.781 --> 34:36.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he posting his angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it?

34:37.422 --> 34:39.463
[SPEAKER_06]: Angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it.

34:39.783 --> 34:44.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to the Better Business Bureau and having everybody going to the Better Business Bureau instead of dig...

34:44.634 --> 34:46.436
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft and Charmus is adamantly saying, sold out does not equal not in stock.

35:13.717 --> 35:16.559
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but what's to stop the Circuit City employee?

35:16.599 --> 35:18.740
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know any better walking into the store.

35:19.500 --> 35:26.845
[SPEAKER_05]: You could walk in there at noon looking for the game and they could be all, Oh, well, we sold out.

35:27.205 --> 35:28.346
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a line.

35:28.906 --> 35:29.526
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

35:30.807 --> 35:32.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, no gift card for you.

35:33.128 --> 35:38.011
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to check out our CDs or a new HDTV or a replacement plan?

35:38.131 --> 35:47.976
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part is, is all the time on those advertisements, there's a little bit of small print that you gotta read, and that's, you know, the offers can change, you know, without notice, so... Ha!

35:48.076 --> 35:52.298
[SPEAKER_06]: They can say, oh, we'll give you free prostitutes, you know, if you come by Super Paper Mario.

35:52.338 --> 35:53.759
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have to, you know, follow that.

35:54.139 --> 35:55.280
[SPEAKER_06]: They can just say, fuck you, bitch.

35:55.880 --> 35:56.801
[SPEAKER_06]: I ain't doing shit.

35:57.641 --> 35:59.322
[SPEAKER_05]: So, could we post a big ad...

35:59.887 --> 36:05.011
[SPEAKER_05]: on the internet somewhere that says, Orange Lounge Radio gives free blowjobs.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.673
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, like, in little fine print, lie.

36:08.934 --> 36:09.634
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a lie.

36:10.235 --> 36:10.875
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Rice Princess?

36:11.536 --> 36:12.957
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be true on your behalf.

36:13.037 --> 36:13.217
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

36:13.577 --> 36:13.918
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

36:13.978 --> 36:18.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Princess actually does give out free blowjobs to all of our... But on your behalf.

36:18.201 --> 36:19.161
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your slut.

36:20.583 --> 36:20.803
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

36:20.883 --> 36:21.523
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hi.

36:22.444 --> 36:26.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-choo-choo-chugga-chugga-choo.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.529
[SPEAKER_05]: This train wreck brought to you by Rice Princess.

36:28.589 --> 36:28.869
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

36:28.889 --> 36:29.149
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, shut up.

36:29.969 --> 36:31.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for ruining our program.

36:31.550 --> 36:32.050
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go now.

36:32.210 --> 36:33.130
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hi, everyone, and bye.

36:34.931 --> 36:35.231
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

36:35.311 --> 36:36.332
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

36:38.313 --> 36:40.854
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin says, I want one, Rice Princess.

36:45.196 --> 36:47.037
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I wish our mics were more sensitive.

36:47.757 --> 36:48.717
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have heard what she yelled.

36:49.518 --> 36:49.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

36:50.418 --> 36:50.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

36:50.898 --> 36:51.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me simulate it.

36:51.819 --> 36:52.039
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what?

36:53.099 --> 36:53.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

36:54.060 --> 36:54.600
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that?

36:54.620 --> 36:55.020
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good.

36:55.400 --> 36:55.761
[SPEAKER_05]: That was good.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.802
[SPEAKER_05]: A little less angry next time, though.

37:01.149 --> 37:03.811
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, well, God, where the hell do we begin with this one?

37:04.551 --> 37:23.702
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of blowjobs for exchange for something, an ad went on Craigslist earlier this week on the 8th, actually about a week ago today, it was on the 8th, and it was this woman making a post there saying, Hello, I need 5,000 world of gold for my epic flying mount.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.364
[SPEAKER_05]: In return, you can mount me.

37:27.423 --> 37:35.731
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be on the Laughing Skull server and I want the 5,000 gold before we do anything.

37:36.051 --> 37:38.373
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make the trade at your place since I can't host.

37:39.334 --> 37:45.180
[SPEAKER_05]: So seriously, she goes on to say, I play a level 70 Night Elf Druid and would prefer someone who is into roleplaying.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.421
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a costume.

37:47.355 --> 38:12.966
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, anyone will do as long as you have the gold I would also be okay with a woman too as long as you have the gold Also not adverse to the idea of groups or anal So other words Prostitution Short translation I'm a big slut who likes WoW too much And I don't even know where to go with this It's prostitution Pretty much

38:13.737 --> 38:16.158
[SPEAKER_05]: But she gets away with it because, A, it's on the Internet.

38:16.218 --> 38:17.679
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming she doesn't live in Nevada.

38:17.779 --> 38:20.720
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what Craigslist site it was posted on, but I don't think it was Vegas.

38:21.220 --> 38:23.341
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyway, it's illegal within the city limits of Vegas anyway.

38:23.401 --> 38:32.746
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was probably illegal, but she gets away with it because it's the Internet and it's not real money.

38:33.326 --> 38:35.047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's offering sex for services.

38:35.587 --> 38:38.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you give amount for amount?

38:39.989 --> 38:40.389
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Rob.

38:41.974 --> 38:54.278
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for those of you that like to tease and taunt this woman, and, you know, obviously her picture was all over the Internet because, you know, you look at the picture and you kind of go, eh, you know, you kind of see her and, you know, she ain't all that.

38:55.759 --> 38:56.859
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not at all.

38:57.939 --> 38:59.140
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but this is the thing.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.941
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple days later, there was a follow-up post.

39:02.541 --> 39:09.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'd just like to thank all the jackasses that thought it would be funny to post my picture all over the Internet and make 50,000 threads about me on the WoW forums.

39:09.665 --> 39:11.865
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my epic mount in about an hour.

39:12.225 --> 39:18.227
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very enjoyable for both parties, while all of you idiots probably spent hundreds of hours farming for yours or don't even have them.

39:18.747 --> 39:24.968
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't be revealing my name or his, but suffice to say if I find any of you in game, I'll be killing you 280% faster.

39:26.148 --> 39:27.168
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little wow joke there.

39:27.888 --> 39:33.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, my new friend would also like to tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

39:34.129 --> 39:36.910
[SPEAKER_05]: She said it twice and capitalized it both times, so I was reading it that way.

39:37.515 --> 39:39.697
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

39:40.618 --> 39:42.620
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm planning to meet him again later this week.

39:42.921 --> 39:44.863
[SPEAKER_05]: He's getting double value for his gold.

39:45.323 --> 39:46.785
[SPEAKER_05]: So talk all the trash you want.

39:46.905 --> 39:52.851
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my epic flying mount and I got laid, which is more than most of you failures can ever hope for.

39:53.792 --> 39:54.753
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, she does make a point.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.616
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as she's got a good attitude about it.

39:58.117 --> 39:58.998
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:19.056 --> 40:25.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because especially since the amount of money that they're talking about, 5,000 gold I think equals about $600 in real money.

40:25.277 --> 40:31.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, you could get a lot more sex for a lot less money if you really wanted to go that route.

40:31.399 --> 40:34.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, it almost sounds like at the end there you're kind of condoning it a little bit.

40:34.139 --> 40:35.780
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, as long as they're both happy.

40:36.140 --> 40:36.740
[SPEAKER_05]: You okay with it?

40:36.900 --> 40:38.600
[SPEAKER_02]: I have absolutely no problem with prostitution.

40:40.261 --> 40:40.781
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

40:41.921 --> 40:43.101
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, and I'll tell you why.

40:43.261 --> 40:44.641
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I got a 20 in my wallet.

40:46.522 --> 40:46.802
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

40:46.822 --> 40:46.862
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

40:47.768 --> 40:48.188
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

41:11.348 --> 41:11.728
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

41:27.901 --> 41:41.808
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know, I mean, like, yeah, I'm all for, like, you know, whatever two people do amongst closed doors and whatever, whatever makes them happy, you know, I don't care, but yet something still strikes me as really, really wrong about this, and I can't put my finger on it.

41:42.608 --> 41:45.550
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you just kind of, like, go, eh, that's just not right.

41:46.490 --> 41:47.311
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not right.

41:47.611 --> 41:49.152
[SPEAKER_05]: To put out for WoW?

41:49.172 --> 41:50.472
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sad.

41:50.492 --> 41:51.633
[SPEAKER_06]: For WoW, Jamie.

41:51.673 --> 41:53.894
[SPEAKER_06]: People put out for 360s and PlayStation 3s and Wii's, so...

41:56.994 --> 42:08.296
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that it's sad, I think, that someone is desperate enough, but honestly, more power to her.

42:08.816 --> 42:16.298
[SPEAKER_03]: If she says, you know what, I have no problem with giving it up a little bit for a mountain.

42:16.338 --> 42:23.159
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's actually no different than the eBay people, honestly.

42:24.113 --> 42:29.077
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would think that... I would say the sad part is that she didn't actually do anything to actually earn it.

42:29.598 --> 42:29.898
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

42:30.598 --> 42:32.220
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, in-game, like everybody else does.

42:33.441 --> 42:38.125
[SPEAKER_05]: But... But there's a lot of people that buy gold from the, you know, IG-type websites and all that.

42:38.205 --> 42:38.505
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

42:39.326 --> 42:40.407
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

42:40.527 --> 42:41.928
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much the same thing.

42:42.765 --> 42:46.806
[SPEAKER_06]: For 600 fucking dollars, that sex better be mind-fucking-blowing.

42:47.086 --> 42:52.488
[SPEAKER_06]: It better be something that sticks in my mind for until the day I die.

42:52.508 --> 42:55.349
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about it being blogged about on every website on the internet?

42:55.389 --> 42:55.669
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

42:55.689 --> 43:02.631
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter, though, because, you know, having sex with some ugly older chick, and the way she has that fucking nappy, long-ass hair.

43:03.852 --> 43:05.252
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, hey, great.

43:05.272 --> 43:07.093
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping to get her on the show for an interview.

43:07.133 --> 43:07.933
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so much for that.

43:07.993 --> 43:08.973
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki ruined those chances.

43:09.294 --> 43:09.674
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

43:09.694 --> 43:10.194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk to her.

43:13.553 --> 43:15.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Knight says I'm doing a PSA.

43:15.894 --> 43:18.075
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking, let's see, what else in chat here?

43:18.856 --> 43:24.218
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 says, woman having sex with men does not equal a slut as long as she's enjoying it.

43:24.238 --> 43:26.059
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if, oh, I think it's unequal too.

43:26.179 --> 43:28.821
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, there's a difference between a slut and a whore.

43:30.012 --> 43:31.713
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's do it for free, whores get paid.

43:31.733 --> 43:32.373
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was being a whore.

43:32.393 --> 43:33.374
[SPEAKER_05]: She was being a whore.

43:33.434 --> 43:35.034
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a world of whorecraft.

43:35.355 --> 43:37.055
[SPEAKER_05]: She wasn't a slut, she was a whore, big difference.

43:37.516 --> 43:43.599
[SPEAKER_05]: But again... I don't know if GSCC might be making the point, if it was a man, would anyone care?

43:43.659 --> 43:45.299
[SPEAKER_03]: There's male prostitutes, they're whores.

43:46.320 --> 43:46.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know that.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.621
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people who give up the butt love for money.

43:48.641 --> 43:50.402
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that a little way too easily, didn't I?

43:50.722 --> 43:51.422
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that!

43:51.442 --> 43:54.304
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I read about it on the internet, of course.

43:56.118 --> 43:57.399
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it for free, okay?

43:57.700 --> 44:05.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I did think it was funny, though, because I've been chatting off and on with Sauce over AIM, which I'm not on.

44:05.431 --> 44:06.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody IM me.

44:06.673 --> 44:06.873
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

44:10.134 --> 44:10.855
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

44:32.731 --> 44:34.332
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if not this, then what?

44:34.692 --> 44:35.732
[SPEAKER_05]: She could have been a stripper.

44:36.092 --> 44:37.152
[SPEAKER_05]: She would have stripped for cash.

44:37.593 --> 44:39.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Just use the cash to buy the gold from IGE.

44:39.853 --> 44:40.333
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

44:40.474 --> 44:42.334
[SPEAKER_05]: All she's doing, she's cutting out the middleman.

44:42.374 --> 44:45.815
[SPEAKER_05]: She's going straight from stripping to her mount.

44:45.955 --> 44:50.037
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same difference of saying, you know, I'll help you with your levels if you help me get my mount.

44:51.537 --> 44:52.677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an exchange of services.

44:53.338 --> 44:57.619
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just bringing it from... Bringing power leveling to a whole new meaning.

44:57.859 --> 44:58.919
[SPEAKER_05]: She could have done stripping.

45:00.380 --> 45:00.400
[SPEAKER_03]: I...

45:01.492 --> 45:03.533
[SPEAKER_03]: I say it was her choice to do it.

45:04.593 --> 45:10.715
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone's going to judge her, look at the own shit you do in your life and see how much you can afford to judge somebody else.

45:10.735 --> 45:11.315
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I say.

45:11.455 --> 45:12.496
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, put it this way.

45:12.676 --> 45:14.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me lay it out to you straight here.

45:15.317 --> 45:20.959
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a 31-year-old woman who cosplays World of Warcraft.

45:21.639 --> 45:22.159
[SPEAKER_06]: So is she.

45:22.259 --> 45:25.380
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a 31-year-old woman who cosplays Naruto.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.040
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your point?

45:26.521 --> 45:27.821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you don't have sex with...

45:28.638 --> 45:31.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking teenagers or whatever for a goddamn mount.

45:33.540 --> 45:36.480
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, she has sex with Dan, and he buys her games.

45:36.700 --> 45:38.621
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean... Yeah, but I married him.

45:40.742 --> 45:42.362
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Jamie has... Wait!

45:42.562 --> 45:43.523
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not 31 yet.

45:44.863 --> 45:46.884
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why Jamie has the sympathy here.

45:47.784 --> 45:48.084
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

45:48.744 --> 45:49.464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

45:49.584 --> 45:50.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, there's a big difference.

45:50.965 --> 45:51.925
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's wrong.

45:52.245 --> 45:52.705
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it is.

45:52.845 --> 45:53.986
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not 31 yet, by the way.

45:54.006 --> 45:55.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, there you go.

45:55.406 --> 45:56.327
[SPEAKER_03]: I have four days!

45:57.247 --> 45:57.747
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it!

45:58.900 --> 46:00.121
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 2 a.m.

46:00.201 --> 46:01.602
[SPEAKER_03]: on Thursday, so just be nice to me.

46:01.662 --> 46:04.084
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if this chick's got, like, fucking kids and stuff.

46:04.144 --> 46:06.526
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because... Mommy, what are you doing?

46:06.546 --> 46:08.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, no money for baby formula, but hey.

46:10.289 --> 46:11.110
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I got my mouth.

46:11.410 --> 46:12.991
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, this topic's gone on way too long.

46:13.812 --> 46:15.253
[SPEAKER_05]: We can bring it up in Skype line again later.

46:15.413 --> 46:17.094
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I have something interesting to talk about.

46:17.254 --> 46:17.535
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

46:18.075 --> 46:19.656
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, you've been eating all the fucking Pocky.

46:20.737 --> 46:21.298
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good.

46:22.058 --> 46:22.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

46:22.518 --> 46:25.681
[SPEAKER_03]: I found a different type of crushed Pocky that's a cookies and cream.

46:26.482 --> 46:26.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway...

46:28.035 --> 46:33.138
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of us are really, really excited about Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, right?

46:34.058 --> 46:34.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

46:36.639 --> 46:37.300
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just kidding.

46:37.320 --> 46:39.161
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360 is pretty rad.

46:39.201 --> 46:40.161
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like it.

46:40.181 --> 46:47.325
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually get the song packs now for $6.25 for three songs.

46:48.125 --> 46:49.706
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's 500 points.

46:50.266 --> 46:53.828
[SPEAKER_03]: The three packs, or pack one is Bark at the Moon, Hey You, and Ace of Spades.

46:54.622 --> 47:21.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Pack 2 is Killer Queen, Take It Off, and Frankenstein Pack 3 is Higher Ground, Infected, and Stellar Which for me, the top of all of those was Pack 1 for me You know, at least two good songs in there But you're basically playing about two bucks a song And the interesting thing that was You know, they're going to keep having these packs on here If they're going to be that much, you're going to end up actually spending a whole lot of money To get some of these extra songs for packs of three

47:23.007 --> 47:27.228
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, can I rant and echo the sentiments of the rest of the entire internet right now?

47:27.589 --> 47:27.989
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

47:28.749 --> 47:30.230
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this is bullshit!

47:31.010 --> 47:34.491
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Guitar Hero 1 costs what?

47:34.651 --> 47:37.592
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, 59 bucks for the guitar and the game, right?

47:37.632 --> 47:38.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar and game?

47:38.332 --> 47:39.633
[SPEAKER_05]: No, maybe 69, I don't remember.

47:39.793 --> 47:40.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was pretty expensive.

47:40.673 --> 47:50.497
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless, it was not $93, which is if Red Octane continues to price the songpacks at this price, you will be paying to have Guitar Hero 1 inside Guitar Hero 2.

47:52.537 --> 47:52.997
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hot.

47:53.478 --> 47:56.480
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why Harmonix is jumping ship and starting a new game.

48:17.830 --> 48:21.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they know it's going to be too much of a good thing in all these downloadable backs.

48:22.153 --> 48:22.534
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

48:23.094 --> 48:25.656
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're really just jumping ship.

48:25.696 --> 48:27.037
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean.

48:27.217 --> 48:35.844
[SPEAKER_06]: They're totally not going to milk the franchise by creating a whole band simulator, which will have fucking billions of downloads for it.

48:35.904 --> 48:37.545
[SPEAKER_05]: This works for Harmonix, though.

48:37.826 --> 48:41.368
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think about it, Loki, they ripped themselves off with Guitar Freaks.

48:41.388 --> 48:42.469
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Freaks is what?

48:42.569 --> 48:44.291
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Amplitude with a guitar controller.

48:45.752 --> 48:46.092
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

48:46.877 --> 48:48.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero, yeah.

49:13.442 --> 49:18.483
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I realize that these old songs are probably, you know, they're already done and they're easy to copy over.

49:18.703 --> 49:19.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then they should be cheap.

49:20.424 --> 49:25.145
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you want me to spend two bucks for the song, I mean, God, iTunes charges like 99 cents a song.

49:25.165 --> 49:27.265
[SPEAKER_05]: And those songs are way better produced.

49:27.666 --> 49:32.767
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, granted, you have to pay somebody to do all the notes and blah, blah, blah, digital distribution fees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

49:33.047 --> 49:37.448
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, for $2, I know you're going to turn a profit by doing some new songs.

49:38.536 --> 49:42.817
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero 2 is kind of lacking in contemporary songs from the past five years.

49:43.157 --> 49:45.258
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't you throw some of those?

49:46.198 --> 49:47.378
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw a classic pack up.

49:47.659 --> 49:49.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Why even do the packs at all?

49:49.639 --> 49:51.540
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of those songs kind of suck, and I don't want them.

49:52.000 --> 49:52.420
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

49:52.440 --> 49:53.440
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're doing packs.

49:53.460 --> 49:55.721
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Killer Queen, but I don't want the other ones in that pack.

49:55.741 --> 49:56.001
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

49:56.681 --> 49:57.962
[SPEAKER_06]: The Red Hot Chili Peppers one, it's...

50:24.082 --> 50:26.644
[SPEAKER_06]: or buying the pack if you really do want all three songs.

50:27.344 --> 50:29.346
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD is making some interesting points in our chat.

50:29.466 --> 50:33.889
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.Orangelandradio.com I think that rhythm games turn into a song upgrade eventually.

50:34.790 --> 50:36.491
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just not much you can do about it.

50:36.731 --> 50:38.452
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like you can innovate a guitar.

50:38.572 --> 50:39.773
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Tony Hawk syndrome.

50:40.974 --> 50:43.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but in a way, in a way...

50:43.999 --> 50:48.680
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Octane did kind of innovate on what already existed as the Guitar Freaks guitar.

50:49.020 --> 50:50.321
[SPEAKER_05]: And you sort of saw it coming.

50:50.401 --> 50:52.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, we've obviously been following rhythm games a long time.

50:53.102 --> 50:57.703
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Red Octane put out four Guitar Freaks, because what did they do before they made games?

50:57.763 --> 51:06.446
[SPEAKER_05]: They were a big rental company who made a huge, huge chunk of their income off of music games, like Konami's Beatmania series and all the songs there.

51:07.466 --> 51:11.427
[SPEAKER_05]: They originally put out a Guitar Freaks controller with five buttons.

51:11.994 --> 51:13.755
[SPEAKER_05]: and everybody always asks, why did they put five?

51:13.775 --> 51:15.015
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Guitar Freaks only has three.

51:15.476 --> 51:17.597
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody said, why is there five buttons on this controller?

51:17.617 --> 51:17.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

51:18.017 --> 51:27.201
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody speculated, oh, Guitar Freaks, like Super Guitar Freaks on PlayStation 2, their Super Duper Guitar Freaks is going to use all five buttons and Red Octane knows that.

51:27.682 --> 51:29.963
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Red Octane was just planning Guitar Hero years ago.

51:30.383 --> 51:34.065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the other thing that you should even get more pissed off about.

51:34.585 --> 51:40.608
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if, some people may have seen this in the forums, and I mentioned a little on top of the show, how I built my own

51:41.138 --> 51:44.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero effects pedal.

51:44.961 --> 51:51.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically the thing, which is going to be yet another purchase, is just a fucking push-button switch.

51:52.268 --> 52:02.096
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something very simple that, I mean, shit, I wear it up in about five minutes, that you're going to have to buy, and that's going to be in addition to the guitar and everything.

52:02.156 --> 52:06.580
[SPEAKER_06]: So say they sell it for ten bucks, there's another ten bucks you're paying for a fucking button!

52:07.225 --> 52:10.989
[SPEAKER_06]: for something that, granted, is probably not necessary, but here are the songpacks.

52:11.289 --> 52:13.631
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet it's something extra that you're going to be buying.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.694
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

52:16.914 --> 52:17.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

52:18.576 --> 52:21.939
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pedal doesn't really do anything yet because it's not implemented in the game.

52:22.099 --> 52:22.540
[SPEAKER_06]: But it works.

52:23.040 --> 52:26.944
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that for a fact.

52:26.964 --> 52:30.227
[SPEAKER_05]: I do agree that other music game series are becoming stagnant as well.

52:30.247 --> 52:31.468
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I love DDR.

52:31.588 --> 52:32.149
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

52:32.642 --> 52:33.523
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:48.695 --> 52:52.779
[SPEAKER_05]: A while ago, my idea, and granted, you don't have to use this idea, this is just an idea.

52:53.159 --> 53:01.628
[SPEAKER_05]: You could innovate DDR by making it a more competitive game, like the whole Dance Magic mode from DDR Disney and Battle Mode in Supernova.

53:01.888 --> 53:04.631
[SPEAKER_05]: Battle Mode in Supernova was just kind of like an afterthought.

53:04.691 --> 53:07.914
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of just quickly done, sloppily done, whatever.

53:08.034 --> 53:09.836
[SPEAKER_05]: And in The Groove, same thing.

53:09.916 --> 53:11.217
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a similar mode in there.

53:11.237 --> 53:12.298
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of an afterthought.

53:13.169 --> 53:22.817
[SPEAKER_05]: Really put some time and energy into a battle mode with, you know, your character select and, you know, I don't know, this whole, like, you got served kind of atmosphere there.

53:23.117 --> 53:26.419
[SPEAKER_05]: And there could be a really fun game in there that's a little more competitive.

53:26.780 --> 53:28.361
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a way you could innovate DDR.

53:28.461 --> 53:29.141
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

53:29.362 --> 53:34.506
[SPEAKER_05]: If they continue to sell a million copies of the game, what DDR Supernova was one of the top 25 selling games last year.

53:34.866 --> 53:40.270
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can continue to make a profit by putting out the same old crap with new tunes, I guess why bother innovating?

53:40.290 --> 53:41.571
[SPEAKER_05]: It costs money to innovate.

53:42.692 --> 53:42.852
[SPEAKER_05]: Meh.

53:43.274 --> 53:44.955
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

54:11.001 --> 54:11.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Quake 3 Quake 3 Quake 3

54:30.376 --> 54:34.098
[SPEAKER_05]: because I want to kill her with a rocket launcher over and over again.

54:34.158 --> 54:36.799
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'll actually literally throw up on you.

54:36.819 --> 54:38.340
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you get the motion sickness thing.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.161
[SPEAKER_05]: How long can you play before you start getting sick?

54:42.301 --> 54:44.542
[SPEAKER_05]: Because 30 seconds is all it takes for me to blow you up.

54:45.483 --> 54:47.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just turn on your machine and sit there?

54:47.064 --> 54:47.664
[SPEAKER_03]: About five minutes.

54:47.984 --> 54:48.604
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, good.

54:48.744 --> 54:50.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Five minutes, I can get five frags on you at least.

54:50.505 --> 54:51.405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really good at Quake.

54:51.546 --> 54:52.046
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well.

54:52.966 --> 54:55.107
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a pro at Gatchaman Quake.

54:55.747 --> 54:56.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Gatchaman Quake?

54:56.888 --> 54:57.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

54:57.568 --> 54:58.369
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can actually play the...

54:59.955 --> 55:01.576
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55:29.167 --> 55:34.131
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of think that, hey, Quake 3 logically is going to go to Xbox Live Arcade, huh?

55:34.911 --> 55:35.592
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we'll see.

55:37.633 --> 55:41.897
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the recent file size increase on Xbox Live would make it very plausible.

55:41.977 --> 55:43.978
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably the only thing that was thought before.

55:44.018 --> 55:45.859
[SPEAKER_05]: Downloadable mods would be great.

55:46.580 --> 55:47.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that would be awesome.

55:48.241 --> 55:51.043
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool if when they release this, they put downloadable mods.

55:51.264 --> 55:56.447
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have a way to do fan-made mods and then have them available through Live.

55:56.507 --> 55:58.449
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Unreal Tournament's going to do that, so...

55:59.573 --> 56:00.933
[SPEAKER_06]: You only have a few more months for that.

56:02.294 --> 56:03.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some other news, though.

56:04.574 --> 56:14.536
[SPEAKER_03]: For anyone who has been keeping up with Lost Planet, it's getting a PC release that will be available in Europe and America in June.

56:17.737 --> 56:25.358
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not giving too many details as far as when it will actually be available in Europe, though.

56:26.844 --> 56:41.930
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to be a Windows Vista title that's using DirectX 10 and will be able to go as high resolution as 2560 by 1600 pixels.

56:42.410 --> 56:43.231
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

56:46.072 --> 56:48.993
[SPEAKER_03]: But also the thing about this is that it's...

56:50.641 --> 56:57.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of contradicting what Capcom's saying, that Lost Planet was only going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive.

56:57.212 --> 56:58.453
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that may be console, though.

56:59.094 --> 57:00.256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so is Gears of War.

57:02.359 --> 57:03.862
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know we're going to get that eventually, too.

57:04.833 --> 57:06.814
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo is exclusive.

57:06.834 --> 57:08.115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got that on the PC as well.

57:08.456 --> 57:10.377
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exclusive to just be released.

57:10.397 --> 57:13.640
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exclusive to Microsoft's empire, which, you know, that's fine, whatever.

57:13.760 --> 57:14.581
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their IP.

57:14.601 --> 57:15.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that does make sense.

57:15.862 --> 57:21.546
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Microsoft can say, oh, well, we're going to put it on PC, too, and it's still a Microsoft product.

57:21.566 --> 57:22.527
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that makes sense.

57:22.547 --> 57:23.928
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not like you're going to see it on a Mac.

57:24.309 --> 57:28.592
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a lot of times the exclusive stuff is when they're talking about just, like, consoles.

57:28.632 --> 57:30.033
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really referring to PCs.

57:30.314 --> 57:33.156
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think they don't really generally...

57:33.916 --> 57:34.716
[SPEAKER_06]: PC Gamers and Console Gamers

58:04.141 --> 58:06.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

58:27.765 --> 58:34.207
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they're going to be doing the O2 Jam thing where you can buy costumes and crap to customize your avatar, that kind of thing.

58:35.087 --> 58:42.850
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently you're going to be able to actually win signed stuff from actually playing the game.

58:42.930 --> 58:44.310
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be kind of neat.

58:45.310 --> 58:47.431
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it's probably going to be ad-supported or something like that.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.291
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

58:49.852 --> 58:54.753
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good that it's free because I played the beta a few months ago and I'll be honest, I don't really remember it.

58:54.813 --> 58:56.774
[SPEAKER_05]: I reviewed it on this show but I couldn't tell you when.

58:58.158 --> 58:59.759
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was not something I would have paid for.

59:00.039 --> 59:01.779
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad to hear they're putting it out for free.

59:02.220 --> 59:05.861
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure, this whole pay for customization, sure, there's people that are into that.

59:05.901 --> 59:06.721
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll make money from it.

59:06.881 --> 59:08.062
[SPEAKER_05]: Advertising, sure, what the hell.

59:08.942 --> 59:12.703
[SPEAKER_05]: How about have certain bands pay to get their songs in there?

59:12.723 --> 59:14.264
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bet you that's what they'll end up doing.

59:15.004 --> 59:15.544
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

59:15.624 --> 59:16.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

59:17.405 --> 59:19.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they do that with Guitar Hero?

59:19.226 --> 59:22.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Have stuff sponsored by different things.

59:22.267 --> 59:25.688
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they have a lot of indie bands in Guitar Hero, which is actually kind of cool.

59:26.249 --> 59:30.572
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think that they could put out a couple free packs of just indie bands who want to get out there and exposed.

59:32.794 --> 59:33.074
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

59:33.915 --> 59:34.756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still early, though.

59:34.856 --> 59:35.737
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... It is.

59:36.097 --> 59:40.500
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this could be very much like Horse Armor for Guitar Hero 2.

59:40.540 --> 59:43.523
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they haven't quite figured it out yet or something to that.

59:43.623 --> 59:45.904
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually read that comparison on some blog somewhere.

59:45.925 --> 59:48.026
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody was calling this Red Octane's Horse Armor.

59:48.587 --> 59:49.507
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could see that.

59:50.468 --> 59:52.730
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly Oblivion... Actually, you know, I'll give it this...

59:53.686 --> 59:54.006
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

59:54.066 --> 59:54.326
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

59:54.367 --> 59:54.767
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

01:00:24.059 --> 01:00:28.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, hopefully you'll be able to pick up one of these in the near future.

01:00:28.321 --> 01:00:35.944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a keyboard for the Xbox 360, but now what you think, it's the type of keyboard that actually plugs into your controller.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:39.025
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's that typical, um, Cordy is what they call it.

01:00:39.045 --> 01:00:44.848
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cordy keyboard, um, that actually plugs into the bottom of your controller so you can have it all right there in your hand.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:45.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Now,

01:00:46.024 --> 01:00:50.405
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you might be thinking, is this is what I thought, is that, you know, well, why the hell do you need one of these?

01:00:50.805 --> 01:00:57.127
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Xbox 360 will actually take any USB keyboard, and it really will, because I played Final Fantasy XI with a USB keyboard.

01:00:57.147 --> 01:00:57.748
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:07.090
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I can pretty much, I have a keyboard plugged into my 360 too sometimes, and it's just a pain in the ass to actually put the controller down, pick up the keyboard, type something, put the, you know, keyboard back down.

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:08.751
[SPEAKER_06]: This would actually be pretty quick for me.

01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:20.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's kind of the upside of it because the thing about Final Fantasy XI is that since it was basically ported from the PC version and PlayStation 2 or whatever, you could play the game completely on the keyboard.

01:01:20.336 --> 01:01:25.518
[SPEAKER_05]: The arrow keys would move your character, but obviously not every Xbox 360 game is going to be built to do that.

01:01:25.618 --> 01:01:28.379
[SPEAKER_05]: So you might need something like this in order to do that.

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:36.583
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're playing an MMO, that's different than actually just texting somebody or just typing something up in a chat window or something like that.

01:01:37.222 --> 01:01:40.724
[SPEAKER_06]: That's completely different to me, because I wouldn't try to play an MMO with that thing, no way.

01:01:41.185 --> 01:01:43.526
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's nice.

01:01:44.327 --> 01:01:46.628
[SPEAKER_06]: That way I don't have to really take my hand off the controller.

01:01:46.668 --> 01:01:50.031
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just type something real quick and go back to the game.

01:01:50.971 --> 01:02:00.958
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope it's not more than $20, because honestly, well, you know, we'll get into the reason this is coming out very soon, but, you know, it's just...

01:02:02.512 --> 01:02:03.872
[SPEAKER_05]: Hostile1 says, that looks useless to me.

01:02:03.892 --> 01:02:05.373
[SPEAKER_06]: Jaded suggests a keyboard mouse combo.

01:02:30.717 --> 01:02:38.642
[SPEAKER_05]: Funnydale says in regards to the Oblivion content we were talking about earlier, it's too bad that the downloadable content in Oblivion will destroy your game if you play it too long.

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:43.725
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, SSJ100Mac makes a good suggestion for Guitar Hero.

01:02:44.306 --> 01:02:47.488
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd pay to have the advantage or the mini-bosses in Guitar Hero.

01:02:48.248 --> 01:02:51.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Too bad most of their songs are covers of NES games, but hey, maybe they can work something out.

01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:56.193
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened to the guitar version of the Halo theme being in there?

01:02:57.654 --> 01:02:59.675
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe that'll be downloadable content later on.

01:03:00.126 --> 01:03:00.486
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:33.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's on tap this week?

01:03:33.369 --> 01:03:34.470
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a bunch of crap.

01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:36.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:03:36.591 --> 01:03:42.215
[SPEAKER_03]: First email actually is a link from Heon.

01:03:47.098 --> 01:03:50.160
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically saying Tamiki Fighters.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:51.601
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

01:03:52.581 --> 01:03:55.463
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point that I wanted to say was actually in the email it says,

01:03:55.885 --> 01:03:56.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanted to let you know about it.

01:03:56.926 --> 01:03:58.046
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki probably already knew.

01:03:58.446 --> 01:04:00.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the show, but it needs more lesbians.

01:04:03.449 --> 01:04:04.210
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:05.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that in our show role later on?

01:04:06.031 --> 01:04:06.491
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:10.493
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I guess Tamiki Fighters was officially announced this week for the Wii.

01:04:10.753 --> 01:04:12.054
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't announced.

01:04:12.094 --> 01:04:13.775
[SPEAKER_06]: It was found on Gamefly.

01:04:14.075 --> 01:04:14.195
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

01:04:14.575 --> 01:04:15.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:04:15.396 --> 01:04:15.856
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

01:04:16.196 --> 01:04:19.058
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like... It was officially leaked on Gamefly.

01:04:19.238 --> 01:04:19.578
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

01:04:21.139 --> 01:04:24.641
[SPEAKER_05]: So... That was a very interesting thing for somebody to go to Gamefly and look for.

01:04:24.681 --> 01:04:25.001
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder...

01:04:26.172 --> 01:04:29.293
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder what tips him off.

01:04:29.594 --> 01:04:31.835
[SPEAKER_06]: People are now checking Gamefly for all sorts of things.

01:04:31.915 --> 01:04:32.595
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's true.

01:04:35.797 --> 01:04:40.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we also have, actually, our friend Rob with 2B's.

01:04:41.314 --> 01:04:41.554
[SPEAKER_03]: No comment?

01:04:41.574 --> 01:04:41.874
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um... Um...

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:11.454
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Game System R

01:05:33.527 --> 01:05:33.887
[SPEAKER_05]: PG-13, PG-13, PG-13, PG-13

01:06:03.257 --> 01:06:07.078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the fuck word is used, like, you know, Janine Garofalo's in it, end of story.

01:06:07.098 --> 01:06:08.439
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Janine Garofalo.

01:06:08.459 --> 01:06:08.939
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't?

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:12.581
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point is, is that, you know, those are very different kinds of movies.

01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:16.762
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I would let my kid watch Romy and Michelle's high school reunion, okay?

01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:19.783
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple little, you know, fucks isn't gonna kill him.

01:06:20.904 --> 01:06:21.444
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

01:06:22.124 --> 01:06:24.205
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear the word fuck and you suddenly want to kill people.

01:06:24.925 --> 01:06:28.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but, you know, I would not let them watch, you know, Terminator 2.

01:06:29.707 --> 01:06:30.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I would.

01:06:30.828 --> 01:06:32.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you and I are different.

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:34.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I saw Terminator 2 in the theater.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:35.481
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:37.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, next email.

01:06:37.701 --> 01:06:38.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, Seisha here.

01:06:39.502 --> 01:06:45.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering what is the opinion on Sony losing executives to Microsoft and whether it will really matter to them.

01:06:45.963 --> 01:06:58.867
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that Final Fantasy XIII is still in talks, but the only reason that Sony may be losing exclusivity for that is because it's costing Squeenix too much money to produce games these days, so going multi-platform solves that problem.

01:07:00.681 --> 01:07:03.762
[SPEAKER_03]: I also don't know if this is true, so don't quote me on it though.

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:07.102
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that I heard and it makes sense.

01:07:07.642 --> 01:07:14.084
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, if Final Fantasy XIII were multi-platform, do you think this would really affect the sales of the PS3 or would it not really matter?

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:16.824
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so sure myself and thought I'd ask you guys.

01:07:17.104 --> 01:07:20.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for keeping this show going and keeping the randomness of it all in.

01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:22.345
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big shout to Irene.

01:07:23.445 --> 01:07:23.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Heart.

01:07:25.346 --> 01:07:25.766
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.

01:07:25.866 --> 01:07:26.666
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good timing.

01:07:27.366 --> 01:07:28.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she just walked in the room.

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:29.387
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, people.

01:07:29.647 --> 01:07:30.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay fooking epic.

01:07:31.068 --> 01:07:31.568
[SPEAKER_03]: Love, Stacia.

01:07:31.588 --> 01:07:34.669
[SPEAKER_01]: Aww, I thought he was going to leave a voicemail, that jerk.

01:07:34.729 --> 01:07:35.290
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:36.470
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Stacia.

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.371
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hot.

01:07:38.031 --> 01:07:38.511
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go now.

01:07:39.211 --> 01:07:39.351
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

01:07:40.952 --> 01:07:42.253
[SPEAKER_01]: So, answer?

01:07:43.533 --> 01:07:50.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, of course they haven't announced anything official, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it does come to the 360 since more people have a 360.

01:07:51.016 --> 01:07:53.897
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I mean, I don't know.

01:07:55.458 --> 01:07:58.359
[SPEAKER_06]: If it did make it over to the 360, yeah, that would be a

01:07:59.481 --> 01:08:24.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Big blow to Sony because it would give people, you know, yet one less excuse to buy a PlayStation 3 because it's like, you know, if you don't have any exclusive games, no one's really going to want, I mean, they've got some pretty good exclusive games with Microsoft and, you know, may not be something that everybody wants, but, you know, it's a lot less exclusive games than say Sony has right now and I don't know.

01:08:25.425 --> 01:08:31.688
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes perfect sense to go multi-platform, but that hasn't really been Squeenix's track record, though.

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.489
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely ones for exclusive content.

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:35.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:43.873
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to be like that, but see now, with Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy VII, they're releasing games on a bunch of different systems.

01:08:44.233 --> 01:08:54.258
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we may see something that's released on the 360 that's different than the PlayStation 3 version, since they're going to make 14,000 different versions of Final Fantasy XIII.

01:08:56.038 --> 01:09:24.385
[SPEAKER_03]: why I don't know but because they haven't milked it enough yet I think what they're trying to do is get the preemptive strike on the multiple sequel thing like they've been doing lately with Final Fantasy 7 although even though I think Final Fantasy Final Fantasy 5 is my favorite of the series but Final Fantasy 6 was I think their most epic but Final Fantasy 7 is the fan favorite I think that they're just trying to say let's make this the next Final Fantasy 7 and beat it into the ground probably

01:09:25.251 --> 01:09:26.492
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes perfect sense for them, anyway.

01:09:27.473 --> 01:09:28.413
[SPEAKER_03]: So, next email, huh?

01:09:30.335 --> 01:09:33.637
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is from Sakura Max, I guess.

01:09:35.038 --> 01:09:41.022
[SPEAKER_03]: By now, I have fallen off for some random landmark in World of Warcraft, maybe like Thunder Bluff, and I am now dead.

01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:42.464
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two requests.

01:09:42.984 --> 01:09:46.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Play iFutureList in my honor, and then have Rob get drunk and play DDR.

01:09:46.727 --> 01:09:48.568
[SPEAKER_03]: While he's playing, make a video and put it on YouTube.

01:09:49.429 --> 01:09:52.631
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously am a dead tauren, and I will be served medium rare...

01:09:54.485 --> 01:09:57.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be served medium rare in a steakhouse in a matter of days.

01:09:58.368 --> 01:10:03.072
[SPEAKER_03]: Sakuramax in Dethika server, still youngest OLR listener, what are your Ravencrest characters' names?

01:10:04.052 --> 01:10:08.356
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to find out the character names, go check out... Yeah, go on the forums.

01:10:08.456 --> 01:10:09.356
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha ha, cheap plug.

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:18.463
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, as far as me drunk playing DDR on YouTube, not going to happen anytime soon.

01:10:18.483 --> 01:10:20.625
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if someone happens to, you know,

01:10:21.141 --> 01:10:23.542
[SPEAKER_05]: Have some Goldschlager nearby a DDR mat.

01:10:23.562 --> 01:10:23.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

01:10:24.002 --> 01:10:24.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe one day.

01:10:24.642 --> 01:10:28.783
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not going to do it for the pure sake of making a stupid YouTube vid.

01:10:29.223 --> 01:10:31.964
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty of DDR drunk vids on YouTube of other fools.

01:10:32.004 --> 01:10:32.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check that out.

01:10:33.124 --> 01:10:37.926
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as playing music on the show, we can't really do that because we can play little clips.

01:10:38.286 --> 01:10:40.446
[SPEAKER_05]: And you hear a little clip of iFutureList in the outro.

01:10:40.466 --> 01:10:41.587
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the song we use for the outro.

01:10:41.887 --> 01:10:44.127
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't really play the full songs without the artist's permissions.

01:10:44.147 --> 01:10:45.928
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, copyright issues, blah, blah, blah.

01:10:46.248 --> 01:10:48.048
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can't put it on iTunes for free and all that.

01:10:49.269 --> 01:10:50.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, next email, shall I?

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:51.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OLR, it's me, Neki.

01:10:54.321 --> 01:10:54.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

01:10:55.522 --> 01:10:56.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Neki's on my MySpace now.

01:10:57.223 --> 01:11:05.107
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been able to get around to emailing in a while due to my business, but I'd like to say the shows have been great, especially last week's, and I think the match game rules.

01:11:05.407 --> 01:11:07.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats on finishing your massage stuff, Jamie.

01:11:07.148 --> 01:11:07.808
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

01:11:08.608 --> 01:11:14.231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to be getting my transcripts next week, and I will have my diploma by the weekend.

01:11:14.751 --> 01:11:15.171
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.

01:11:15.251 --> 01:11:15.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad.

01:11:16.032 --> 01:11:18.573
[SPEAKER_05]: We will do match game again soon, but we don't want to beat it into the ground.

01:11:19.133 --> 01:11:19.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:20.594
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar hero.

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:24.516
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read the email!

01:11:24.596 --> 01:11:26.598
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Match Game, coming soon to mobile phones.

01:11:28.499 --> 01:11:34.484
[SPEAKER_03]: And also for all the people that find fault in your show about being so informal, they should listen to this show when you weren't there, Jamie.

01:11:34.804 --> 01:11:35.064
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:40.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, it was all Loki reading news and Rob telling bad jokes as he wasn't up on news that week.

01:11:40.668 --> 01:11:41.409
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that every week?

01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:42.830
[SPEAKER_05]: He was just being lazy that week.

01:11:44.151 --> 01:11:48.014
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, if you thought that week was bad, just wait for next week, because here's the deal.

01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:49.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:12:18.103 --> 01:12:22.644
[SPEAKER_05]: B, I didn't want to make Jamie drive down by herself on her birthday, and then I found out Chris was going, so I wouldn't have to anyway.

01:12:23.145 --> 01:12:23.745
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't matter.

01:12:23.765 --> 01:12:24.985
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.

01:12:25.025 --> 01:12:26.966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll fly back and forth, be the fun little traveler.

01:12:27.146 --> 01:12:27.826
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be good.

01:12:29.106 --> 01:12:32.807
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm not going to be here at all next week, so I will not be really following gaming news next week.

01:12:32.888 --> 01:12:34.868
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be the Loki show.

01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:39.089
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to keep going, this is mostly just to me.

01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:42.090
[SPEAKER_03]: As you love pinball and like Lego, here's a great match.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:44.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's apparently a pinball match.

01:12:44.892 --> 01:12:46.593
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox 360 Regional Compatibility Guide

01:13:07.395 --> 01:13:08.536
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know that was possible.

01:13:08.696 --> 01:13:16.760
[SPEAKER_03]: The website is at xbox-sky.com slash xbox360 underscore regional underscore compatibility underscore guide.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:26.544
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, there's actually a few games on here that work on like, are they talking about like all regions or just compatible games?

01:13:26.564 --> 01:13:29.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they have that official list on Microsoft's site.

01:13:30.946 --> 01:13:33.828
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all region.

01:13:35.169 --> 01:13:35.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty interesting stuff.

01:13:37.117 --> 01:13:38.958
[SPEAKER_03]: A few games are multi-region.

01:13:39.038 --> 01:13:40.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Far Cry works on both.

01:13:40.779 --> 01:13:42.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear works on all three.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:46.782
[SPEAKER_03]: It even goes as far as listing the PAL ones as well.

01:13:47.042 --> 01:13:47.602
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:51.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, thanks for the link.

01:13:51.324 --> 01:13:52.305
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.

01:13:52.365 --> 01:13:53.746
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm looking at this list as well.

01:13:53.766 --> 01:13:54.366
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of weird.

01:13:55.246 --> 01:13:58.308
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to actually link the thing in the chat room.

01:13:58.708 --> 01:13:59.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless, Rob, you want to do it for me?

01:13:59.849 --> 01:14:00.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, why not?

01:14:00.289 --> 01:14:00.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:14:00.409 --> 01:14:00.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:14:01.224 --> 01:14:03.346
[SPEAKER_03]: R2-D2 is being made into a real projector.

01:14:17.034 --> 01:14:28.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving forward, after Loki's raving about Earth Defense 2017, I started to look into it, and the USNTSC version supposedly works with UK PAL systems, according to the website I aforementioned.

01:14:28.522 --> 01:14:35.847
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish Microsoft made 40 to 80 gigabyte hard drives for the 360 instead of just making a 20 gigabyte and the announced 120 gigabyte.

01:14:36.228 --> 01:14:42.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just bitching, but I should get an XSATA and link a PC hard drive to it.

01:14:43.169 --> 01:14:47.271
[SPEAKER_03]: My home site, dscommunity.co.uk, is currently being serviced.

01:14:48.111 --> 01:14:50.832
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the phrase, being serviced.

01:14:51.333 --> 01:14:55.835
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having maintenance, so this isn't going anywhere, but the new site will be up, quote, soon.

01:14:56.035 --> 01:14:56.875
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice plug, by the way.

01:14:56.895 --> 01:14:58.496
[SPEAKER_03]: He's saying, yeah, I got my site in.

01:14:59.216 --> 01:15:00.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, bye, Neki.

01:15:02.038 --> 01:15:04.118
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that email was sent just to get a free plug in.

01:15:04.419 --> 01:15:04.679
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:15:04.979 --> 01:15:05.579
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Neki.

01:15:05.639 --> 01:15:06.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Neki's cool.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:08.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Last email.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun, dun, dun.

01:15:10.922 --> 01:15:27.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, love the show, and while this question is simple and may have already been answered, I feel obligated to ask, after being able to talk about your show to a wide variety of people that I meet every day whenever I might currently be, whether it's at school, work, convention, or at a concert, simply, how many people do you estimate listen to your show?

01:15:27.914 --> 01:15:28.454
[SPEAKER_03]: End of sentence.

01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:29.575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

01:15:30.976 --> 01:15:32.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Kurt somebody, who am I going to say the last name?

01:15:34.799 --> 01:15:35.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:40.523
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say real quick, looks like you can actually, I'm not a huge fan of, you know,

01:15:42.481 --> 01:15:43.962
[SPEAKER_06]: Soccer or football.

01:15:44.923 --> 01:15:47.525
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can get Football Manager 2006 and 2007.

01:15:47.906 --> 01:15:49.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Both will work on the U.S.

01:15:50.628 --> 01:15:51.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox 360s.

01:15:51.849 --> 01:15:52.509
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of neat.

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:54.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it's in PAL.

01:15:54.611 --> 01:15:56.072
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm sure if you're TV, you know.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:58.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't HD standard?

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, HD is pretty standard.

01:16:01.617 --> 01:16:05.140
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the answer to the question, you know, I'm going to be honest.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.961
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't track it very well.

01:16:08.242 --> 01:16:11.245
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a program that can see how many times a show was grabbed.

01:16:11.687 --> 01:16:14.328
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:16:40.457 --> 01:16:42.259
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need an excuse to hang out with you, Rob.

01:16:42.859 --> 01:16:44.280
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean, though.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.802
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an excuse in the end.

01:16:47.643 --> 01:16:48.564
[SPEAKER_05]: Heart, heart, heart.

01:16:50.625 --> 01:16:51.546
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.427
[SPEAKER_03]: I do need a good excuse to hang out with Loki.

01:16:55.008 --> 01:16:58.471
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the beginning, we had about 12, 15 people.

01:16:59.192 --> 01:17:01.614
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to lowball it.

01:17:01.814 --> 01:17:04.136
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:17:04.276 --> 01:17:05.156
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of weird.

01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:07.898
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we should say.

01:17:09.199 --> 01:17:09.900
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not important.

01:17:10.868 --> 01:17:11.648
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really important?

01:17:11.968 --> 01:17:12.488
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it is.

01:17:13.109 --> 01:17:13.249
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:17:14.049 --> 01:17:15.329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say this.

01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:16.390
[SPEAKER_05]: It's four digits.

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:20.031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somewhere between 1,000 and 9,999.

01:17:20.531 --> 01:17:23.171
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll leave it there on the lower end.

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:24.512
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's it.

01:17:24.592 --> 01:17:25.432
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for the emails.

01:17:26.532 --> 01:17:26.852
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:17:27.853 --> 01:17:28.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

01:17:29.093 --> 01:17:36.035
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, as we kind of alluded to before the whole mailbag, and we actually kind of mentioned it last week a little bit,

01:17:36.812 --> 01:18:04.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Spring Update is going to add a lot of things to the Xbox 360 including instant messaging via Windows Messenger and that kind of ties in with the whole keyboard attachment for the controller but you're going to be able to message people while playing games and also while watching movies and they're also going to allow you to add Windows Messenger friends to your list as well which is kind of nifty and

01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:22.014
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other things are going to be added as well, including they've got support for some different video codecs, like MPEG-4, H.264, and Play For Sure, which is kind of neat.

01:18:23.275 --> 01:18:27.136
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but no Xvid and DivX support yet.

01:18:28.376 --> 01:18:32.377
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, there's a ton of things that they're adding to that, and that's awesome.

01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:34.418
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that they're adding stuff instead of...

01:18:40.385 --> 01:18:46.910
[SPEAKER_05]: Is anyone in here going to get used out of that whole MSN feature that you can message people on MSN?

01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.071
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I won't.

01:18:48.691 --> 01:18:50.753
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want people to send me messages while I'm gaming.

01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:56.196
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the occasional, hi, let's play Texas Hold'em or whatever message is fine.

01:18:57.597 --> 01:19:01.941
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want to sit there and chat with someone while I'm trying to play a game.

01:19:02.421 --> 01:19:03.922
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually that takes concentration, you know?

01:19:04.224 --> 01:19:04.985
[SPEAKER_06]: How about this, Rob?

01:19:05.345 --> 01:19:08.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Switchable aspect ratios while watching video playback.

01:19:09.369 --> 01:19:14.173
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do Letterboxd, Zoom, Stretch, and Native since you've lost your remote.

01:19:14.513 --> 01:19:15.594
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't lose the remote.

01:19:16.195 --> 01:19:19.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody lost their remote, but it wasn't me because it happened while I was on vacation.

01:19:19.878 --> 01:19:20.759
[SPEAKER_05]: But we won't go there.

01:19:24.202 --> 01:19:25.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else.

01:19:26.685 --> 01:19:26.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

01:19:28.436 --> 01:19:29.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is kind of cool.

01:19:29.257 --> 01:19:39.465
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole downloading stuff, while you can download in the background, you can also set your 360 to automatically turn off after your downloads are complete, or to run in a low-power mode.

01:19:41.266 --> 01:19:41.866
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a PC.

01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:56.998
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, a new option in auto-downloads for Xbox Live Arcade games provides faster access to the entire collection of free trial versions of Xbox Live Arcade games.

01:19:57.618 --> 01:19:58.239
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of nifty.

01:20:00.606 --> 01:20:00.846
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:20:02.467 --> 01:20:06.730
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rob Dean chant is taunting me because I always decline his hold'em invites.

01:20:07.691 --> 01:20:08.231
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad.

01:20:08.291 --> 01:20:08.951
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's kind of cool.

01:20:09.612 --> 01:20:23.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Updates to Xbox Live Arcade to allow owners to quickly see what Xbox Live Arcade games their friends are playing and join them, as well as tell a friend capabilities where they can boast about their achievement scores.

01:20:25.462 --> 01:20:26.923
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, so I'm going to get spam messages.

01:20:27.825 --> 01:20:31.388
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got five points in Boom Boom Rocket for playing a song.

01:20:31.808 --> 01:20:32.189
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

01:20:35.751 --> 01:20:36.412
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be fun.

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:39.434
[SPEAKER_02]: That's... yeah.

01:20:39.615 --> 01:20:41.836
[SPEAKER_05]: God, the chat room is making me sound like such an ass.

01:20:42.857 --> 01:20:44.158
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not an ass, Rob.

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:47.821
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, they're like, oh, Rob never comes play Texas Hold'em with us.

01:20:48.001 --> 01:20:51.524
[SPEAKER_05]: GAK120 says, Sky's too cool to play with us, Rob D. It's not that.

01:20:51.544 --> 01:20:53.786
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it you guys play on, like, what, Friday and Saturday night?

01:20:54.206 --> 01:20:55.207
[SPEAKER_05]: That's clubbing night.

01:20:56.308 --> 01:20:57.349
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go clubbing anymore.

01:20:58.266 --> 01:20:59.427
[SPEAKER_05]: Once in a great while, I do.

01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:00.568
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go.

01:21:01.849 --> 01:21:02.950
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we can sometime.

01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:04.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:21:06.132 --> 01:21:06.572
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this?

01:21:06.973 --> 01:21:10.715
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go clubbing when I finally play Hold'em with Rob D. How's that sound?

01:21:11.976 --> 01:21:12.517
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just teasing.

01:21:12.537 --> 01:21:13.898
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to go back out to karaoke sometime.

01:21:13.918 --> 01:21:14.338
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fun.

01:21:14.598 --> 01:21:15.119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do.

01:21:15.359 --> 01:21:16.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, back to games.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.902
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I could bring my Guitar Hero controller to karaoke.

01:21:19.922 --> 01:21:20.583
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be fun?

01:21:20.763 --> 01:21:22.724
[SPEAKER_05]: People would so laugh at you.

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:23.805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, talk about looking like an ass.

01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:31.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, last week on the show I ranted and raved and I was so pissed off because my guitar was broken.

01:21:31.867 --> 01:21:33.649
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, well, you know, it did work.

01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:34.289
[SPEAKER_05]: It would play the game.

01:21:34.329 --> 01:21:37.672
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just upset that I had one of those model numbers that was part of this whole recall.

01:21:37.832 --> 01:21:39.174
[SPEAKER_06]: You could fix them, by the way.

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:40.354
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but here's the thing.

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.115
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you don't have to.

01:21:41.135 --> 01:21:44.858
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently Red Octane has patched the guitars via Xbox Live.

01:21:44.898 --> 01:21:46.400
[SPEAKER_05]: They rolled out a patch last night about 4 a.m.

01:21:47.795 --> 01:21:53.138
[SPEAKER_05]: That will resolve the situation where input from the whammy bar was not always recognized.

01:21:53.238 --> 01:21:54.999
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it comes down to a calibration issue.

01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.300
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what else it does?

01:21:57.641 --> 01:21:59.342
[SPEAKER_05]: It bricks consoles, supposedly.

01:21:59.362 --> 01:22:00.942
[SPEAKER_05]: It freezes your game, yay!

01:22:01.143 --> 01:22:05.745
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, there's reports on the internet, something's hit and dig, like all these people's consoles are getting bricked.

01:22:06.345 --> 01:22:10.167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that's just unfortunate coincidence, or if the patch did something.

01:22:10.668 --> 01:22:13.409
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is calibration, that's what it was.

01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:14.650
[SPEAKER_06]: And, I mean...

01:22:15.228 --> 01:22:43.475
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have fixed mine except the dumbasses that built the fucking thing they put hot glue in the screws so I can't I'd have to scrape the hot glue out of the screw in order to undo the whammy bar to adjust it thank you very much you bastards how dare they well here's something that we started asking why they dare since a lot of people are not too very fond of the first one although I thought it was cool

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:50.054
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a rumor that there will be a Perfect Dark Zero sequel in the works.

01:22:51.315 --> 01:23:04.005
[SPEAKER_03]: In the May edition of the official Xbox magazine, there was a rumor pointing that it was actually in progress.

01:23:04.885 --> 01:23:07.608
[SPEAKER_03]: And that there will be book tie-ins to go along with it.

01:23:07.628 --> 01:23:09.449
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now it's rumor mill fodder.

01:23:09.749 --> 01:23:10.690
[SPEAKER_05]: Book tie-ins?

01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:11.210
[SPEAKER_05]: Joy.

01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:11.951
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a lot of books.

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:14.520
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, wait, what game's getting a sequel?

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.720
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect Dark Zero.

01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:19.781
[SPEAKER_01]: Dork.

01:23:20.021 --> 01:23:21.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I wasn't a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.

01:23:22.442 --> 01:23:25.102
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like the fact that you can't jump.

01:23:25.162 --> 01:23:26.563
[SPEAKER_05]: This show needs a soundboard.

01:23:26.963 --> 01:23:32.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they need to take Crackdown and Perfect Dark Zero and merge them into a game where you actually have normal jumps.

01:23:34.605 --> 01:23:35.665
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the super jumps.

01:23:35.725 --> 01:23:36.766
[SPEAKER_05]: I like being able to fly.

01:23:36.786 --> 01:23:37.386
[SPEAKER_02]: I like jumping!

01:23:38.506 --> 01:23:39.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, jumping!

01:23:39.686 --> 01:23:39.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

01:23:41.107 --> 01:23:41.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:49.292
[SPEAKER_06]: This week, Capcom has had their Gamers Day, although we weren't invited.

01:23:50.053 --> 01:23:56.501
[SPEAKER_06]: And they announced a bunch of different games and stuff, and a lot of stuff for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network.

01:23:56.988 --> 01:24:07.130
[SPEAKER_06]: including some stuff that you're probably not too surprised about including Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix which is a fucking long-ass name and stupid.

01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:10.251
[SPEAKER_05]: Just when you thought they couldn't make a Street Fighter 2 game with a longer title.

01:24:10.291 --> 01:24:11.291
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's the joke.

01:24:11.471 --> 01:24:13.372
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's seriously a joke.

01:24:14.252 --> 01:24:16.752
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, hey, we need a longer Street Fighter 2 game name.

01:24:17.632 --> 01:24:21.433
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Duper Turbo HD Remix to the max extreme.

01:24:21.553 --> 01:24:21.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame.

01:24:21.993 --> 01:24:22.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's lame.

01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:24.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Lame, lame, lame.

01:24:24.949 --> 01:24:26.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix

01:24:53.863 --> 01:24:55.524
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that in our match game a couple weeks ago?

01:24:55.564 --> 01:25:00.286
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't we do a match game just like three weeks ago here on the show about what games do we want, and Puzzle Fighter came up?

01:25:00.626 --> 01:25:00.886
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably.

01:25:00.926 --> 01:25:03.287
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome, because I think I put it on the list.

01:25:04.548 --> 01:25:05.548
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want Puzzle Fighter.

01:25:05.568 --> 01:25:06.088
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

01:25:06.108 --> 01:25:06.489
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll buy it.

01:25:06.649 --> 01:25:07.169
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.490
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard they're adding new modes and stuff, too.

01:25:11.131 --> 01:25:14.712
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have a Puyo Puyo style mode in it, and that's rad.

01:25:15.192 --> 01:25:16.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute.

01:25:16.533 --> 01:25:19.314
[SPEAKER_05]: The game was kind of like Puyo Puyo, actually, now that I think about it.

01:25:19.714 --> 01:25:22.676
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also the other game, Panel de Pon, which I think...

01:25:24.165 --> 01:25:27.128
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle the Pawn is Bustamove Puzzle the Pawn is exactly the same game

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.101
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure somebody in chat is correcting us right now.

01:25:49.161 --> 01:25:55.686
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have a version of... I mean, how many fucking games do you have to shoot bubbles and connect to... I'll be damned, he's right.

01:25:55.786 --> 01:25:58.448
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the puzzle bubble shooting game.

01:25:59.588 --> 01:26:00.789
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it was paneled upon.

01:26:00.829 --> 01:26:01.590
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it paneled upon?

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:02.370
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzled upon.

01:26:03.331 --> 01:26:03.851
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

01:26:03.991 --> 01:26:05.472
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to play this game all the time.

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:09.735
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what game I would love them to bring out a version of over here?

01:26:09.795 --> 01:26:10.536
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Puzzling Desu.

01:26:10.596 --> 01:26:11.536
[SPEAKER_05]: It's paneled upon.

01:26:11.596 --> 01:26:12.517
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be this game.

01:26:13.578 --> 01:26:14.558
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes much more sense.

01:26:14.698 --> 01:26:15.639
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Tetris Attack...

01:26:16.021 --> 01:26:16.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Pokemon Puzzle League.

01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:17.962
[SPEAKER_05]: That game makes more sense.

01:26:18.302 --> 01:26:19.843
[SPEAKER_05]: That game makes more sense to have in there.

01:26:20.203 --> 01:26:21.344
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's paneled upon.

01:26:21.384 --> 01:26:21.904
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

01:26:23.185 --> 01:26:24.685
[SPEAKER_03]: I still want Puzzle and Descent.

01:26:25.886 --> 01:26:31.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, one last game they're going to be getting is Rocketman, Exos of Evil, and Talisman.

01:26:31.809 --> 01:26:35.671
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and it's basically, you know, this universe that they've created.

01:26:35.831 --> 01:26:40.213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very similar, like, Robotron crossed with, they were saying, um,

01:26:41.246 --> 01:26:42.026
[SPEAKER_06]: Geometry Wars.

01:26:42.627 --> 01:26:44.528
[SPEAKER_06]: They're comparing everything in Geometry Wars nowadays.

01:26:44.588 --> 01:26:46.749
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, it's going to be a top-down shooter game.

01:26:48.189 --> 01:26:52.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, lots of characters to choose from and lots of shit you're going to be blowing up.

01:26:52.892 --> 01:26:54.152
[SPEAKER_06]: So, awesome!

01:26:54.753 --> 01:26:57.514
[SPEAKER_06]: That's coming Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

01:27:00.362 --> 01:27:06.846
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if Shane was here, he'd be very happy to hear that Phoenix Wright 3 was also confirmed at Capcom Gamers Day.

01:27:06.906 --> 01:27:09.327
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations.

01:27:09.447 --> 01:27:12.289
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there's a little trailer that goes with it that you can see on the internet.

01:27:12.889 --> 01:27:14.450
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane was watching it over and over this weekend.

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:15.471
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a little glimpse of it.

01:27:15.891 --> 01:27:18.893
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe it goes back to one time.

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:23.536
[SPEAKER_05]: The story has to do with when Phoenix Wright was once sued and was in court.

01:27:23.936 --> 01:27:25.057
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

01:27:25.837 --> 01:27:27.358
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of Phoenix Wright fans out there.

01:27:27.378 --> 01:27:28.439
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be very happy about this.

01:27:28.659 --> 01:27:28.999
[SPEAKER_05]: I still...

01:27:29.497 --> 01:27:31.198
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have somehow missed the first games.

01:27:31.238 --> 01:27:40.284
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those series like, you know how everybody has those lists of games I really should play someday now, but I just don't have the time because I'm too busy clubbing?

01:27:40.824 --> 01:27:41.745
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those games.

01:27:41.765 --> 01:27:42.565
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, question for you.

01:27:42.805 --> 01:27:43.006
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:27:43.206 --> 01:27:51.971
[SPEAKER_06]: How long do you think before they get a Wii version where when you yell out, hold it, you have to actually point the remote at the screen like you're pointing?

01:27:52.131 --> 01:27:52.832
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I hope so.

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:57.755
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you can't get enough Attorney games, hey, wait for this.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:03.890
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP.

01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:08.052
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not the new stuff, but, you know, the old console's feeling a little loved there.

01:28:08.933 --> 01:28:25.924
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's the Adult Swim cartoon there, and, you know, he defends famous cartoon characters, so that should be interesting about how they're going to make that, because they'd have to get other licenses to get, like, you know... But I guess they just won't have any of the other

01:28:27.608 --> 01:28:28.429
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew Nami, ThePhoenixRightFan

01:28:52.581 --> 01:28:57.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Young Phoenix Wright being on trial for murder with his teacher Mia Fey defending him

01:29:16.557 --> 01:29:20.101
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys listening to the podcast, just have to wait a couple days because we like to space it out.

01:29:20.121 --> 01:29:22.163
[SPEAKER_05]: That way you get a lot of Orange Lounge Radio all week long.

01:29:22.904 --> 01:29:26.988
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll get Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Those of you guys that are listening live, stay tuned.

01:29:27.008 --> 01:29:28.450
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back after this.

[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:29:34.696 --> 01:29:39.001
