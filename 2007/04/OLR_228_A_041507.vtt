Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, April 15th, 2007, 360 is set to get a new keyboard for its spring update.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
It's Parappa the Rappa set to get another sequel, and would you mount for a mount?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
The answer is no, but we'll get to that later in the show.

00:35.000 --> 00:42.000
Hi, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Money.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
That's what I want.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
No, that's what I just spent a whole bunch of.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Really, on what?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
On one of our giggling lesbians.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
I see. Alright. Well, can I have a loan?

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
Ask my accountant.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Alright. Uncle Scrooge, is Uncle Scrooge your accountant?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
No.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Hello.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Good. So far.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
So far?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Yeah.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
But what might make things go bad tonight, just so I don't do it?

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
I need food. I only have two Pepsis to go off of, and I haven't had dinner yet.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Angry Loki needs food badly.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm not angry, I'm just hungry.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Don't shoot food.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Exactly. Unless it's into my mouth.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Not Angry Loki is about to die.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
I love Gauntlet, but seriously, they overdid Gauntlet. Like, I used to love Gauntlet, but not anymore.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
Like, you know, then we had the Midway Arcade Treasures Gauntlet, then we had the Xbox Live Gauntlet, then we had, you know, it was overdone.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Gauntlet was good, but it wasn't that good.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
It should have been, like, Gauntlet Legends, and, you know...

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Gauntlet Legends was pretty awesome. I wouldn't mind seeing that on Xbox Live Arcade.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Because that was a fun, like, actual arcade title.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Alright. Well, anyway.

02:08.000 --> 02:17.000
Hi, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, where that podcast here every week, we tape live Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
Heading into our sixth year, really, because our fifth birthday, so I would be heading into your sixth year.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Our fifth birthday is coming up in June. That's going to be exciting.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
So, we're hoping to have a big show for that one.

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
I've had folks actually email us asking if they can come over for the big anniversary show.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I would make a suggestion.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
What's that?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
It's all over the floor.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Well...

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
You've probably got enough for a corpse.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
It's a nice gesture, but the problem is that Orange Lounge Radio kind of tapes in the spare bedroom of my place.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
And, as much as I'd like to have, like, you know, 50 listeners over just to kind of hang, I don't know if the landlord would like that.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
So, we're thinking about, at least I'm kind of putting this out there, having a block party for OLR's fifth birthday, like, somewhere else.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
Like, at Golf Land or, I don't care, Chuck E. Cheese. I don't give a shit.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I have a grill at my house.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
It's not here. Want to go to your house? Have a barbecue?

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
We can have a barbecue at my house.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Orange Lounge Barbecue?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Let's do the Orange Lounge Barbecue with pinball.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
So, you don't care if strangers come to your house?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I'll just have to lock up everything in the vault.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Alright, there you go. Hide Shermy. Because somebody might try to kill her.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Shermy will hide herself.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Alright. Anyhow, so more details on that to come. That'll be coming up in a couple months.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Alright, let's get to it. We'll start off with How Was Your Gaming Week? Dark Soccer.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
Um, I yelled at Dan for not bringing back Marvel Ultimate Alliance again.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
And, uh, that's actually, you know, I played a lot of Cookie Mama while waiting at the bank.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Things I do for us.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
The sacrifices I make.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I learned how to make Tonkatsu.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Have you not played Cookie Mama on the Wii yet?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
No, I'm broke.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
You really should at some point. Borrow mine, because I'm going to be gone for a week anyway.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
It's the worst voice acting I've ever heard in a game. Ever.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Yuck.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, wait. Resident Evil, then Cookie Mama.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I hope that is not Chris's blood.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
You don't want to end up in a Jill's sandwich.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Right.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Anyway.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Or do you?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Gotta...

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
I don't know.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Perf.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
You know, we need to do that for our fortune cookie if we still have it.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I don't even know where the hell that...

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
The Resident Evil prone...

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah, somebody sent me that on me three times. It was like Resident Evil voice acting...

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I sent it to you!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Well, I have deleted it, I'm sure.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Bitch.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I have a delete everything Jamie sent me button.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Because Jamie fills up my computer with crap.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
No I don't.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
So I have a big pink button.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
No I don't.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I send you awesome.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
So, is that it? Cookie Mama, what you gave me a week?

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh, that and then let the PSP battery die.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.040
and I couldn't find the charger so poo on him so that was a game you didn't

05:06.040 --> 05:14.480
play very well done Jamie ah shut up also Joe you just got back from a road

05:14.480 --> 05:20.400
trip right so yes angry angry drivers driving just stupid people that's why I

05:20.400 --> 05:24.960
thought all right Loki how was your gaming week I played earth defense force

05:24.960 --> 05:34.740
2017 per usual so that's fun I played briefly guitar hero 2 and that was

05:34.740 --> 05:39.600
about as fun as the first one in which case I'm probably not gonna play much of

05:39.600 --> 05:44.840
it why the fuck I bought it it's beyond me same reason I bought DDR though

05:44.840 --> 05:50.600
haven't really played much DDR either play boom boom rocket that was fun

05:50.600 --> 05:56.040
actually it's doing pretty good on some of the songs but I don't they get pretty

05:56.040 --> 06:00.240
hard and some of the achievements are actually pretty easy like unlocked five

06:00.240 --> 06:06.280
after playing like the first song or something is weird and then I played

06:06.280 --> 06:12.980
gnarly golf which that's an old Apple to GS game that I played through an Apple

06:12.980 --> 06:18.800
to GS emulator on the internet and I miss that game except it's really crappy

06:18.800 --> 06:22.440
now why that game of all games I don't know it's a game I used to play a long

06:22.440 --> 06:27.640
time ago and it was fun I remembered it being a lot more fun but the emulator

06:27.640 --> 06:34.240
didn't work right right so you never lose lives so I beat the whole game and

06:34.240 --> 06:40.360
I was like this dumb uh then let's see what else did I play I played Super

06:40.360 --> 06:48.320
Paper Mario and it has way too much dialogue 20 minutes of fucking dialogue

06:48.320 --> 06:56.600
before I can play the game that's retarded but it's okay so far what else

06:56.600 --> 07:06.760
did they play that's about it I think yeah all right let's see I Mikey movie I

07:06.760 --> 07:11.680
also play Super Paper Mario a lot I think it's great I think it's an awesome

07:11.680 --> 07:17.240
game I like the whole old-school side scroller thing mixed with like the

07:17.240 --> 07:21.600
role-playing elements and I think that 3d thing is freaking brilliant I love

07:21.600 --> 07:24.000
the fact that you can you know hit the button and suddenly you're in the 3d

07:24.000 --> 07:27.840
world and you really have to kind of explore and dig around and then like the

07:27.840 --> 07:31.000
fact that the other characters have their abilities to see I have to juggle

07:31.000 --> 07:34.800
it it's really like imagine if Super Mario Brothers were like a puzzle game

07:34.800 --> 07:38.320
in some regards like practice for the game feels like sometimes there's fetch

07:38.320 --> 07:42.800
quests and everything it's fun but I'm unlike Loki I thought the dialogue was

07:42.800 --> 07:45.720
kind of fun I mean yeah it has a long opening to the game but you know they're

07:45.720 --> 07:48.720
just trying to set the stage because you know they couldn't have just done

07:48.720 --> 07:52.680
another you know princess gets kidnapped story although well to some extent that

07:52.680 --> 07:56.320
is what they did but it's much deeper than that this time so when they

07:56.320 --> 08:00.120
introduced new characters and you know there's that quirky sense of humor that

08:00.120 --> 08:03.040
comes with a lot of the Mario role-playing games like definitely

08:03.040 --> 08:06.520
reminds me the Mario and Luigi series series the sense of humor that's in the

08:06.520 --> 08:10.960
game so I disagree with you look yeah I think I think the dialogue is cool well

08:10.960 --> 08:15.100
it didn't have the dialogue was cool it's just I didn't really care for 20

08:15.100 --> 08:18.480
minutes of it right in the beginning of the game you know to me why just why

08:18.480 --> 08:22.080
didn't you skip the opening wedding because I wanted to know the story

08:22.080 --> 08:28.920
because that obviously it's there if it's important I mean so I just wish

08:28.920 --> 08:32.280
they would have liked you know paraphrased or maybe broken it up a

08:32.280 --> 08:37.040
little bit you know instead of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

08:37.040 --> 08:40.440
blah blah blah blah play a little bit Oh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

09:10.440 --> 09:15.720
Seriously though, why the fuck is the storyline almost like ripped from Sonic the Hedgehog?

09:15.720 --> 09:22.120
I mean, you have to collect these, like, jewel things or whatever to, you know, get the chaos

09:22.120 --> 09:23.120
heart.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.120
I mean, come on!

09:24.120 --> 09:25.120
I didn't think of that.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.720
It's like fucking Sonic the Hedgehog.

09:27.720 --> 09:28.720
So whatever.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.720
I'll play the game.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.720
It's gonna be awesome.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.760
No, don't get me wrong, but it's just, seriously, they could've spaced out the dialogue a little

09:34.760 --> 09:35.760
bit more.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.760
Gotta love our chat room.

09:36.760 --> 09:40.920
OrangeLawnTradio.com, always the fourth guest here on the program.

09:40.920 --> 09:46.440
Duckator says, if Loki wanted to know the story, then why is he complaining?

09:46.440 --> 09:49.840
Bandit says, Loki is just upset he has to read for a change.

09:49.840 --> 09:54.440
It's like fucking Stephen King, you know, wrote goddamn Super Paper Mario.

09:54.440 --> 09:59.040
It's like, and Luigi came, buh buh buh buh buh, I mean, Stephen King just writes about

09:59.040 --> 10:03.840
nothing for pages at a time, and then there's actual plot going on, and it's about nothing.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.680
It's like, okay, and then the characters are about to get attacked, when all of a sudden

10:07.680 --> 10:11.600
my attention was drawn away by a butterfly, and I'm gonna go down the street and find

10:11.600 --> 10:12.600
out what goes down there.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.480
And the difference is that he gets paid a lot of money to go off on tangents.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.480
Exactly.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.480
Stupid.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.480
But that's right.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.320
I've gotten past dialogue now, so awesome.

10:21.320 --> 10:26.160
Just need Super Mario RPG to come to virtual console and we'll be all good.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.160
The game is great.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.160
I just bought that!

10:28.160 --> 10:29.160
For three dollars.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.160
Oh, the original cartridge, right?

10:30.160 --> 10:31.160
Yep.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.160
Where'd you find that?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.640
Stephen traded it in at Dan's store, so he bought it.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.640
Well, lucky you.

10:35.640 --> 10:36.640
I'm sure that'll be awesome.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.120
You think that'll come out on virtual console?

10:38.120 --> 10:41.680
I would've thought they would've put that out around the time that Super Paper Mario,

10:41.680 --> 10:44.880
or putting out Paper Mario, I don't know.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.760
Anyway, the game's awesome.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.000
Don't listen to Loki's rants.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
It's tolerable.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
I didn't say it wasn't awesome.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.880
I just said there's a lot of fucking dialogue in it.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.820
Alright, well, great.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.800
If you're okay with reading, then it won't bother you.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
You just have to read.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.080
I play video games, so I don't have to read that much.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.080
Alright.

11:01.080 --> 11:06.800
The only thing I think is gonna be a problem for the game is that once I beat it, I don't

11:06.800 --> 11:10.840
really see it as being the type of game I'm gonna go back through and play again a lot.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.280
But I guess you could say the same thing about Final Fantasy.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.280
I don't know.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.600
Final Fantasy always had a lot of side stories and things to collect, and although Paper

11:16.600 --> 11:19.440
Mario has, I guess, those cards or whatever, I don't know.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.880
I kinda see it as something I'm gonna play once and be done with.

11:22.880 --> 11:23.880
But we'll see.

11:23.880 --> 11:24.880
We'll see.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.380
Ask me again when I get there.

11:27.380 --> 11:32.800
But it's a phenomenal game for the 20, 30 hours I'll spend playing it.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.080
Also my game of the week, Boom Boom Rocket.

11:35.080 --> 11:40.360
That's the only game I've ever played where I found myself in the top 10 on the Xbox leaderboards.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.320
I don't think I'm there anymore, and I should've taken a picture of it, because, hey, it makes

11:44.320 --> 11:47.840
my internet-y penis feel big that I was in the top 10 on the leaderboard.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.720
But yeah, I went into the medium leaderboard.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.440
I was number five one day.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.080
And I know you might be thinking, well, medium, why don't you impress me on the hard leaderboard?

11:56.080 --> 12:00.800
I was trying to get that achievement where you get A's on all 10 medium songs.

12:00.800 --> 12:05.600
And I guess that's the default leaderboard that your scores that you see in the main

12:05.600 --> 12:07.280
Blades page comes from.

12:07.280 --> 12:11.680
So I have this insanely high score somehow, which is weird, because I did not get 100%

12:11.680 --> 12:12.880
perfects on all the songs.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.920
So I don't know, whatever.

12:15.920 --> 12:18.900
I guess I've just been playing rhythm games so long that it really didn't take me long

12:18.900 --> 12:20.480
to get accustomed to Boom Boom Rocket.

12:20.480 --> 12:26.160
It's basically DDR with erratic paths that the arrows take to get to the line.

12:26.160 --> 12:30.160
The song list in Boom Boom Rocket, though, seriously, it sucks.

12:30.160 --> 12:35.000
It's all classical remade tunes, and I think maybe like two of them are good, and the rest

12:35.000 --> 12:37.160
of the songs I won't want to play again.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.760
I liked actually some of them.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.180
There's one that was like a drum and bass remix, and that was pretty awesome.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.300
I don't know.

12:43.300 --> 12:47.320
I wanted to just hook up a DDR pad, because to be honest, I'm like, these patterns aren't

12:47.320 --> 12:49.800
that hard, but why can't I fucking hit them on the controller?

12:49.800 --> 12:53.880
I'm all, fuck this shit, I should just put a pad in there.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.200
Somebody asked me, sent me a message if you could play the game with a DDR pad, and I'm

12:57.200 --> 12:58.200
sure, I haven't tried it.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.200
I think you can.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.200
I'm sure, why couldn't you?

13:00.200 --> 13:03.400
The DDR pad is just a substitute for the directional buttons.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.640
There's no reason you couldn't do it, because you can play Boom Boom Rocket with the D-pad

13:06.640 --> 13:08.680
or the buttons, which is actually how I do it.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.080
I use both.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.640
I use left on the D-pad, and then the other three I use the buttons, because that allows

13:13.640 --> 13:15.100
me to have the triggers as well.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.400
It takes a little bit of getting used to, but seriously, try it.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.200
Don't do all direction, or don't do all buttons.

13:20.200 --> 13:24.840
Do like one or two of the arrows on the direction pad, and then the other two on the buttons,

13:24.840 --> 13:28.960
and if you play a couple easy songs to get used to it, you'll be fine.

13:28.960 --> 13:34.900
There is one that confused me that actually had like four buttons come up at once.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.900
So I was like, um, okay.

13:35.900 --> 13:39.080
Well you wouldn't be able to do that on a dance pad.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.560
Well it was up, up, and left, left.

13:43.560 --> 13:48.040
Well then yeah, you probably just have to do what I'm doing there, hit left on D-pad

13:48.040 --> 13:49.040
and left on the button.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.040
I don't know.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.240
I think I do remember seeing that, but I got around somehow.

13:52.240 --> 13:56.040
Um, because I haven't played the game really for one night, just like I played it hardcore

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
like one night.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.720
I played it for hours, but the songs just aren't replayable for me.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.680
That's the difference between Boom Boom Rocket and like DDR, or Beatmania.

14:03.680 --> 14:08.560
Let's say Beatmania, which you know, obviously this game is hugely inspired by.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.180
Beatmania has songs that are easily replayable over and over again, and Konami obviously

14:13.180 --> 14:16.880
has some great in-house artists to create a lot of original songs.

14:16.880 --> 14:22.200
Granted they license stuff, but in the Japanese versions it's all J-pop crap none of us care

14:22.200 --> 14:23.200
about anyway.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.760
Well okay, maybe a little bit.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.480
Maybe a little guilty pleasure side.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.400
But most of it is forgettable, right?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.160
But the original in-house stuff is great.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.780
You know, Naoki, Taka, Akira Yamaoka, they all create great stuff.

14:34.780 --> 14:39.880
So I can't believe a big company like EA does not have in-house artists that are capable

14:39.880 --> 14:40.880
of creating music.

14:40.880 --> 14:46.440
Unless they license all that rock music junk for burnouts and all that stuff anyway.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.440
EA tracks.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.440
EA tracks.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.440
Exactly.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.640
Why couldn't we have had some of that on Boom Boom Rocket?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.120
Is that just because maybe it was a risky project?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.600
It's because there's downloadable packs later.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
Oh great.

14:56.600 --> 15:03.540
So you know, bend me over and charge me up the wazoo for expandable packs that are not

15:03.540 --> 15:05.840
even going to be that great I'm sure.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.480
And it's probably going to be just like Guitar Hero.

15:07.480 --> 15:12.600
We'll get into that later.

15:12.600 --> 15:16.360
Dark Tetsuya in chat says EA tracks for the lose.

15:16.360 --> 15:20.240
SSJ100 Matt says fucking Avril.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.820
Dark Shy says no insult J-Pop.

15:22.820 --> 15:24.700
It's not all bad, but come on.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.000
Some of it's pretty forgettable.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Some of it's not.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
I like M-Flow.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.480
They're pretty cool.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.800
Third style for life.

15:31.800 --> 15:36.160
Anyhow, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.920
If everyone's done with their gaming week, tonight's housekeeping, not a lot.

15:39.920 --> 15:46.200
I do want to give a cheap plug for the All Games Community site, which is something we've

15:46.200 --> 15:51.680
kind of put our might behind as well in endorsing the All Games.

15:51.680 --> 15:55.500
It's kind of like Myspace, but without the cam bots and horrors and stuff.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.760
And it's people talking about video games.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.760
It's pretty awesome.

15:58.760 --> 16:02.800
So if you want to visit it, it's community.allgames.com, and all three of us have profiles on there.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
I'm on there.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.800
DarkSakura's on there.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.800
Matt's on there.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.480
I'd like you to check out if you have a chance.

16:08.480 --> 16:13.920
I just wrote an article called the Top 10 Edutainment Titles of All Time, because you

16:13.920 --> 16:17.120
might remember last week I talked about how I went to Monterey and I played an educational

16:17.120 --> 16:18.120
tide pool game.

16:18.120 --> 16:24.040
And it kind of got me thinking this week, what are my favorite edutainment games from

16:24.040 --> 16:25.040
yesteryear?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.880
And of course, number one's The Oregon Trail.

16:26.880 --> 16:31.800
But I'll leave you to figure out what the other nine are.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.160
And actually, I was looking at some of the comments, and I thought this was interesting

16:34.160 --> 16:37.800
because the Rob D. already commented on my post, he says, this is probably just a generational

16:37.800 --> 16:42.360
gap considering that anything more than five years constitutes a gap for edutainment.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.280
But no learning company games other than Carmen Sandiego?

16:45.280 --> 16:47.480
And he kind of goes on to name some of his favorites.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.240
And yeah, I'm looking at my list again.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.480
I was kind of old.

16:51.480 --> 16:55.520
Like a lot of my titles are really old, like Apple IIe, like Rocky's Boots, and some of

16:55.520 --> 16:56.520
that stuff.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
Oh, fuck.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
What?

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
I don't remember that.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.400
You know, I had to get really obscure for some of these.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.960
But these were games I played.

17:02.960 --> 17:06.520
And I think the one like frickin' probably no one has heard of is Cave of the Word Wizard.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.040
But seriously, that game was scary as hell.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.040
I've heard of it.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.040
Have you?

17:11.040 --> 17:12.040
For the Commodore 64?

17:12.040 --> 17:13.040
Yeah.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.220
Dude, it's freaky because this game is about who made this?

17:15.220 --> 17:17.860
TimeWorks Inc. made this for the Commodore 64.

17:17.860 --> 17:21.400
And basically, you went around this cave, and you had to jump over rocks, and you were

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
collecting crystals.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.320
And you had to avoid bats and rocks.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.000
And if you messed up, then you lost a Band-Aid.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.120
Well, randomly, in this like flash of light, like the little cheesy Commodore 64 sound

17:32.120 --> 17:39.440
effects, this little wizard would appear, and he'd go, spell anti-disestablishmentarianism,

17:39.440 --> 17:40.440
or whatever word.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.240
Because he used the voice chip in there, right?

17:42.240 --> 17:45.160
So you'd have to spell it out, and hope you heard him right, because the voice chip kind

17:45.160 --> 17:46.160
of sucked.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.160
It was a Commodore 64.

17:47.160 --> 17:56.200
Yeah, it would be like, now spell.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.680
And if you got it right, he would give you a Band-Aid.

17:58.680 --> 18:04.760
But if you got it wrong, he'd go, it's getting darker, and he'd take flashlight power from

18:04.760 --> 18:05.760
you.

18:05.760 --> 18:09.360
And so you were left to die in this cave, because of this horrible wizard who wanted

18:09.360 --> 18:12.600
to punish people who couldn't spell.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.520
But obviously, if you've ever read my live journal, you'll see this game actually taught

18:15.520 --> 18:16.520
me nothing.

18:16.520 --> 18:22.440
Anyway, check it out, community.allgames.com, look for my blog.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.560
DarkSockerLoki, do you guys ever post your blogs?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.760
I've seen Logie post a few things.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.760
No.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.960
I've seen pictures of my cat up there.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.040
Logie posted something a couple weeks ago that just hit the rest of the internet this

18:33.040 --> 18:36.800
week, but we'll leave you to find out what that is.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.360
Let's get on with the real show, shall we, Logie?

18:39.360 --> 18:40.640
Yes, shall.

18:40.640 --> 18:48.080
Anyways, so not a big surprise, but Perrin Kaplan, open her big fat mouth again, and

18:48.080 --> 18:51.120
is talking about Nintendo Wii shortages.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.080
And basically saying they're doing everything in their power to make sure that the systems

18:55.080 --> 19:01.800
are out there, but it's just a supply and demand situation, and there's nothing more

19:01.800 --> 19:02.800
that it can do.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.240
They're at maximum production.

19:05.240 --> 19:10.740
I have a hard time believing that, but that's what they're saying, so I guess that's what

19:10.740 --> 19:12.360
we've got to go off of.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.240
But here's why I don't believe that.

19:15.240 --> 19:20.960
You don't see any accessories or any systems or anything, well, I mean, not very much hitting

19:20.960 --> 19:25.840
the retail markets and stuff.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.200
Okay now, explain this to me.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.540
Those stupid point cards, it's fucking cardboard.

19:31.540 --> 19:37.640
Why the fuck aren't there billions of these things out there, I mean, it's cardboard.

19:37.640 --> 19:43.760
It's not some fucking fancy chip, it's a piece of cardboard.

19:43.760 --> 19:49.240
So that's why I don't believe this stuff, because it's fucking impossible to find this

19:49.240 --> 19:50.240
stuff.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.760
I don't know about the controllers and all that stuff, but I don't understand why these

19:52.760 --> 19:58.760
controllers are any harder to make than, say, the classic controller or whatnot.

19:58.760 --> 20:03.600
It's not that complicated of a piece of equipment, so I don't understand why it's taking them

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
so long.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.760
Well, you don't need those cards anyway.

20:05.760 --> 20:06.760
The cards are pointless.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.320
You get charged tax on those cards.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.320
Buy them online.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.320
I understand.

20:10.320 --> 20:13.680
You don't get charged tax as long as you're not in a state that will screw you over on

20:13.680 --> 20:14.680
it.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.680
Sorry, folks.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.680
I understand that, but there's...

20:16.680 --> 20:18.240
Pennsylvania or whatever state's charged for that.

20:18.240 --> 20:23.080
Some people like the cards for, say, I don't know, the kids that don't have credit cards

20:23.080 --> 20:24.080
or stuff like that.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.520
Allowance bonus thing.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.160
Steal your mommy's wallet.

20:27.160 --> 20:32.600
But this is just an example, though, basically, of how even the smallest things they're sold

20:32.600 --> 20:35.920
out of right now, something that should be able...

20:35.920 --> 20:40.960
So if it's a production issue, I mean, I don't see why they can't ship more of these cards.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.120
These things should be fucking easy to make.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.120
Same with the controllers.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.160
The controllers aren't that complicated.

20:46.160 --> 20:53.240
I mean, hell, even, you know, the classic controller doesn't really have any major parts

20:53.240 --> 20:56.560
in it that weren't in, like, say, the GameCube or something like that.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.780
Like, the GameCube controllers.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.260
Why the fuck can't they make more of them?

21:00.260 --> 21:01.800
Maybe they're made from magic trees.

21:01.800 --> 21:02.800
Oh, okay.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.920
Well, there you go.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.280
You know, magic trees.

21:06.280 --> 21:11.480
Miyamoto has to handpick each tree that will become the cardboard used for Wii Points cars.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.840
That's what they're gonna have in Animal Crossing.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.440
They'll have to plant the trees that they'll use to make those stupid points cards out

21:16.440 --> 21:17.440
of.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.680
They can just shake the trees and then the magical point cards will fall out.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.760
They could just recycle.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.320
I'm sure they have a bunch of stuff.

21:24.320 --> 21:27.560
Jamie will come to my village and chop all the trees down, I'm sure.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.560
Yes!

21:28.560 --> 21:29.560
That's what probably happened.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.240
You know, someone came into their village, chopped down all the magic trees that produce

21:33.240 --> 21:37.400
these stupid cards, and that's why they're gone.

21:37.400 --> 21:42.280
So yeah, if you're looking for a Wii, you're not gonna find them for a while, unless, you

21:42.280 --> 21:45.920
know, whether it's something that Nintendo's doing on purpose, which would make no sense,

21:45.920 --> 21:48.880
or if it's just, you know, that they can't make enough, whatever.

21:48.880 --> 21:52.080
Either way, it's gonna be, you know, hard to find them.

21:52.080 --> 21:56.440
But hey, if it's any consolation, there aren't really that many games that are major that

21:56.440 --> 21:59.160
are coming out between now and Christmas.

21:59.160 --> 22:04.040
Okay, I hate to derail here, but Mikolatov has joined us and he's come in the room and

22:04.040 --> 22:07.340
he's laughing his ass off, and I know you guys are playing video games out there.

22:07.340 --> 22:10.800
By the way, like, Mikolatov, X-Differ, and Rice Princess are all here, but none of them

22:10.800 --> 22:13.360
wanted to come on the show tonight because they're too cool for you.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.920
But what is so goddamn funny that you guys, I hear you laughing up a storm out there.

22:16.920 --> 22:17.920
It's distracting!

22:17.920 --> 22:19.560
We're trying to do a show in here!

22:19.560 --> 22:20.560
Oh, okay.

22:20.560 --> 22:27.000
So, Christopher is playing Marble Mania, and that was in my office, and you know, I saw

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
it.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
I thought it was a really fun game.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
It is really fun.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.420
But he picked the panda marble, and if people don't know about this game, every time the

22:33.420 --> 22:37.760
marble rolls, it makes noises, and if it runs into things or falls down, it makes noises.

22:37.760 --> 22:43.640
The panda sounds like it's farting, and it runs into things, and it's the funniest thing

22:43.640 --> 22:47.600
ever, and I'm dying of laughter out there, and Christopher can't play because I'm laughing

22:47.600 --> 22:48.760
so hard.

22:48.760 --> 22:53.920
So you guys are laughing at fart noises, and that's what's derailing this entire show.

22:53.920 --> 23:03.600
It's like this cute little panda, and it's farting constantly as it rolls.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.600
Don't die!

23:04.600 --> 23:06.320
It's all that eucalyptus, you know.

23:06.320 --> 23:10.320
It's Cassie shit.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.320
Pandas eat bamboo, you dipshit!

23:12.320 --> 23:14.200
Oh, my mistake.

23:14.200 --> 23:18.400
Hey, this is what I get for not reading.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.520
Bamboo, whatever!

23:20.520 --> 23:21.520
It's Cassie!

23:21.520 --> 23:27.520
I don't fucking give a shit if they're eating eucalyptus or bamboo.

23:27.520 --> 23:33.760
Maybe that's your problem, you're feeding the panda eucalyptus.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.640
Well thank god I don't work at a zoo.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.880
They'd be dead.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.440
The chat room is asking if it's for...

23:39.440 --> 23:40.440
Koala Panda!

23:40.440 --> 23:44.080
DJ Dark Knight's asking in chat, is it 4.20 this week?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.800
No, we're not.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.560
We're role models for the young kids.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.800
We don't do that here at Orange Lunch Radio.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.320
What is the whole FBI thing that showed up before Final Fight?

23:54.320 --> 23:58.120
Winners don't use drugs, remember that, boys and girls.

23:58.120 --> 24:03.320
Winners do find fun things on the internet, and now you will have the Nintendo Wii Opera

24:03.320 --> 24:06.280
browser to check out the internet with.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.920
The final version has gone online this week.

24:08.920 --> 24:13.340
You might have gotten the little blue light of love, as I call it, because when the blue

24:13.340 --> 24:16.360
light goes off on the Wii, you know somebody loves you.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.360
But in this case it was Nintendo saying, hey, it's ready for download.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.620
So the full version of the internet channel is there.

24:22.620 --> 24:26.760
The new features is, thank god, that little bar at the bottom of the screen will now auto

24:26.760 --> 24:27.760
hide.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.120
You have to enable it as a feature, but you can get rid of that, so you can have your

24:30.120 --> 24:31.120
YouTube's full screen.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.400
You can just hit one, and it will hide it.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.400
Awesome.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.520
You can also zoom in and out at a lot.

24:37.520 --> 24:43.760
I noticed when I was on YouTube, I could zoom in a lot smaller portions at a time.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.840
So it was really easy to get the video in the center of the screen without having to

24:46.840 --> 24:50.880
worry about trying to get it full screen, and da-da-da, and all that stuff.

24:50.880 --> 24:56.120
You can also do www.com at a click of a button, because all that's in there.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.960
They just kind of gave it a little bit of a visual makeover, so it was supposed to run

24:58.960 --> 24:59.960
a little faster.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.280
Although, I don't know.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.440
I don't know if it's something about maybe the way my router's set up, or the Wi-Fi,

25:04.440 --> 25:07.560
but internet channel is slow.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.200
So slow.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.100
It's faster to browse the internet on my PSP.

25:12.100 --> 25:15.800
It's faster to browse the internet on, obviously, a computer.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.600
But on the Wii, it is so tremendously slow.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.960
I can't understand why the Wii is so much slower.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.080
Does it just not have the power to handle, or what?

25:23.080 --> 25:29.440
Well, just like I tried, I don't know, loading up even the weather channel, or forecast channel,

25:29.440 --> 25:30.440
whatever.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.440
Any of the channels.

25:31.440 --> 25:37.200
It takes fucking forever to load up, so it's just slow.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.200
Am I supposed to enable some port in my router?

25:41.200 --> 25:44.480
You know how for some file share programs, you're supposed to open up certain ports in

25:44.480 --> 25:50.200
your router, and direct them directly to one of the things that is connected to the router?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.800
You know what I mean?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.840
Maybe I'm supposed to do that for the Wii, to make it run faster.

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
Who knows?

25:55.840 --> 25:56.840
Eh.

25:56.840 --> 26:00.560
Well, maybe you have to just, like, grease it or something.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.120
Maybe I just have to feed it eucalyptus.

26:02.120 --> 26:06.280
Yeah, you have to feed it eucalyptus leaves, and turn it into a koala.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.120
Well, here's some-

26:08.120 --> 26:09.120
Whatever.

26:09.120 --> 26:13.860
I don't give a shit if fucking koalas.

26:13.860 --> 26:14.860
It would be more- Koalas are cute.

26:14.860 --> 26:18.120
It would be a lot cuter than a fucking panda, I can tell you that much.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.160
Koalas are cuter than pandas, because they have those big noses.

26:21.160 --> 26:26.320
Anyway, speaking of things that have nothing to do with a big nose, for those who have

26:26.320 --> 26:33.840
their Wiis and are keeping up with Virtual Console releases, there is a, I don't know

26:33.840 --> 26:38.820
if everybody's aware of this, but ActRaiser is out on Virtual Console.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.920
We love some ActRaiser, don't we?

26:40.920 --> 26:41.920
Not in this country.

26:41.920 --> 26:46.520
Well, that's exactly it, it's out in the UK.

26:46.520 --> 26:53.840
It actually has 800 Wii points, and basically it's the same old Super Nintendo game where

26:53.840 --> 26:55.680
you walk around and you're God.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.920
I like walking around as God, I do that every day.

26:57.920 --> 26:58.920
I love that.

26:58.920 --> 27:03.120
ActRaiser is seriously one of my favorite games ever from the Super Nintendo.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.640
Incredible soundtrack, incredible gameplay, it's-

27:05.640 --> 27:07.320
Ah!

27:07.320 --> 27:10.760
I like smiting my enemies.

27:10.760 --> 27:18.560
Also out for Virtual Console is Pac-Man for the NES for 500 Wii points, Bonk's Revenge

27:18.560 --> 27:21.600
for TurboGrafx-16 at 600 Wii points.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.240
Blah, blah, blah, all I heard was ActRaiser, honestly.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.800
When do we get it?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.560
I'm hoping that's a good sign we get it on Monday, except for the fact that I'm going

27:29.560 --> 27:30.560
to be out of town all week.

27:30.560 --> 27:31.560
Poor baby.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.560
I know, poor me.

27:32.560 --> 27:33.560
Should we go to Disneyland?

27:33.560 --> 27:34.560
Yeah, that's true.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.560
I'm going to Disneyland.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.840
ActRaiser or Disneyland?

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
I don't know.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.080
We can bring the Wii with us.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.080
That's a good idea.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.080
Let's bring a Wii.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.080
Yeah, we should.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.080
Okay.

27:43.080 --> 27:49.320
Yeah, the only thing I would be wondering is, now Pac-Man is almost like Linux, because

27:49.320 --> 27:52.520
Pac-Man is, you can play Pac-Man on everything.

27:52.520 --> 27:55.120
Except for the Atari 5200 version, which is unplayable.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.120
I'm sorry, 2600.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.120
Oh, yeah.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.760
The 2600 version is like...

27:58.760 --> 27:59.760
Crap!

27:59.760 --> 28:00.760
Yeah, no.

28:00.760 --> 28:01.760
It's like Pac-Man barf.

28:01.760 --> 28:02.760
It's not real Pac-Man.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.720
It's, I can't believe it's not Pac-Man.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.720
It's Diet Pac-Man.

28:06.720 --> 28:16.000
Anyways, so other games coming to Virtual Console, Sonic 2 and Shining Force, they've

28:16.000 --> 28:23.200
been spotted on the Virtual Console servers, and they're expected to be out, probably Monday.

28:23.200 --> 28:27.600
So you know, we'll have to see if that actually happens, but they're there, and that's usually

28:27.600 --> 28:29.880
a good indicator that they're coming out Monday.

28:29.880 --> 28:34.960
Ooh, Rice Prince is in chat and says Actraiser will be coming out this or next week.

28:34.960 --> 28:41.800
Hey, maybe that's a good sign that, you know, this Actraiser, or the UK release will mirror

28:41.800 --> 28:42.800
the release that we get.

28:42.800 --> 28:43.800
But we already got Pac-Man, right?

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
I think we already got Pac-Man.

28:45.800 --> 28:46.800
I know.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.760
Not that I really care, because I'm not going to go down.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.480
Maybe we'll get Ms. Pac-Man or some bullshit.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.480
I don't care.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.480
I just want Actraiser.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.480
It's like an original game.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.720
That would be nice to have someday, wouldn't it?

28:56.720 --> 28:57.720
Originally made games?

28:57.720 --> 28:59.720
Yeah, we'll see.

28:59.720 --> 29:00.720
Someday.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.720
Alright.

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
Let's see.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.720
Also, speaking about Nintendo.

29:03.720 --> 29:07.920
Oh, you're going to love this story, Loki, because I know you love piracy, but Nintendo

29:07.920 --> 29:09.600
does not.

29:09.600 --> 29:14.840
You might know that recently in the news, the US has complained to the World Trade Organization

29:14.840 --> 29:21.880
about China, and it's because piracy is running rampant throughout China.

29:21.880 --> 29:27.600
Nintendo put out a press release earlier this week, on the 10th, saying that they support

29:27.600 --> 29:28.600
this.

29:28.600 --> 29:33.320
Nintendo, of course, they lose money a lot because of piracy.

29:33.320 --> 29:37.600
What I kind of find surprising, well, first, let me read the quote here, quote, Nintendo

29:37.600 --> 29:41.440
will continue to work with the US government while aggressively pursuing counterfeit Nintendo

29:41.440 --> 29:43.000
products in China.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.800
We're pleased the US government is pushing China to comply with its trade commitments

29:46.800 --> 29:50.160
in an effort to protect the lifeblood of the copyright and trademark industries.

29:50.160 --> 29:56.720
That quote coming from Jody Doherty, Nintendo of America's Senior Director of Anti-Piracy.

29:56.720 --> 30:00.640
What's kind of interesting about that, though, is that their ROMs and their old shit still

30:00.640 --> 30:03.280
run rampant throughout the internet.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.400
They haven't really shut a lot of sites down.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.840
Some of the really, really big ones get shut down, but not really by Nintendo.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.640
It's pretty easy to find Nintendo ROMs.

30:10.640 --> 30:15.520
Hell, there's that one site where you could play all the video games online, or I don't

30:15.520 --> 30:17.720
remember, it's like everyvideogame.com or something like that.

30:17.720 --> 30:21.320
You can play them all right there in your browser, and Nintendo certainly has an interest

30:21.320 --> 30:26.120
in old games because they're making five bucks off of everyone they can sell to a virtual

30:26.120 --> 30:27.120
console user.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.120
I don't know.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.120
Great.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.120
That's not China's problem.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.120
That's happening right here.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
I'm glad they hate piracy.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.120
I'm glad they're blaming China.

30:33.120 --> 30:43.520
It's not like, because America, no one here pirates anything ever, never ever.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.360
The Rob D in chat says ROM sites don't really exist anymore.

30:46.360 --> 30:47.840
It's mostly torrents.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.600
Yeah, that's true.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.280
But still somebody's hosting the torrents, right?

30:51.280 --> 30:53.880
You got to host the seed file somewhere.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.400
Depends on where it's legal or illegal.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.600
You remember all the crap with Pirate Bay.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.320
Pirate Bay just says back in Go, you guys are stupid.

31:00.320 --> 31:06.560
Tiger Claw says, Sky, you're talking about virtualnes.com.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.760
So we all know Tiger Claw is a big pirate.

31:09.760 --> 31:15.840
Well, this is actually something that's, I think, pretty cool.

31:15.840 --> 31:23.720
The company, Datel, has a program for the PC where you can create, manage, and alter

31:23.720 --> 31:30.360
your Mii avatar for your PC.

31:30.360 --> 31:39.320
It's actually 1,499 pounds and $1,999 in the US, but you can download it off of their site.

31:39.320 --> 31:41.640
It's at Code Junkies.

31:41.640 --> 31:47.480
And the website is, just go to codejunkies.com and look it up.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.480
It's actually pretty cool.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.960
And I'll be posting the link in the chat room.

31:50.960 --> 31:55.720
I believe there's actually some free stuff that's out there that does the exact same

31:55.720 --> 31:56.720
thing.

31:56.720 --> 32:03.760
In fact, website wemodwe.com, and that's W-I-I mod W-I-I dot com.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.320
And they have kind of something similar where you can exchange stuff.

32:07.320 --> 32:11.600
You just basically have to have some sort of Bluetooth adapter or Bluetooth in your

32:11.600 --> 32:14.320
laptop or computer or whatever, and it does it for free.

32:14.320 --> 32:19.720
But to be honest, though, why the fuck is Datel releasing a PC editing program for Miis?

32:19.720 --> 32:23.240
I thought the Wii already had that.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.480
You can just do it on your Wii.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.200
Isn't it funner to do it on your computer?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.200
I don't know.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.200
You know what?

32:30.200 --> 32:33.440
I just like that I have a Bluetooth device, and I like that it's called a dongle, because

32:33.440 --> 32:34.440
that's a funny word.

32:34.440 --> 32:37.760
Why don't they have that for, I don't know, say, the DS?

32:37.760 --> 32:38.760
That'd be kind of neat.

32:38.760 --> 32:39.760
That would be kind of cool.

32:39.760 --> 32:43.240
It would be cheesy and stupid and useless, but neat.

32:43.240 --> 32:47.740
You know, I did find that DS in Super Paper Mario, and it is pretty deceiving.

32:47.740 --> 32:52.800
I totally thought at first, before I remembered that story that was on the internet, I totally

32:52.800 --> 32:55.840
thought at first, I was like, wait, it's saying connectivity, looking for connectivity?

32:55.840 --> 32:56.840
What a tease!

32:56.840 --> 32:59.720
What a little cock tease that was, having a little DS there in the game, thinking there

32:59.720 --> 33:02.220
was going to be some type of functionality.

33:02.220 --> 33:05.640
By the way, thanks to the Magica Radio, I had just run out to the living room real quick,

33:05.640 --> 33:09.980
and I saw them playing a Korowinpa Marble Mania, and the farting panda's really fucking

33:09.980 --> 33:10.980
funny.

33:10.980 --> 33:11.980
It really is funny.

33:11.980 --> 33:17.480
It sounds like when the dog walks across the stones in Labyrinth, the Bog of Eternal Stench.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.480
Remember that?

33:18.480 --> 33:19.800
Where it's just farting noises all the time.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.400
You've never seen Labyrinth?

33:23.400 --> 33:24.400
The Bog of Eternal Stench?

33:24.400 --> 33:25.400
Yeah, the Bog of Eternal Stench.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.400
Oh, god.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.100
So bad!

33:28.100 --> 33:29.480
The last time I saw it, I was like eight.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.360
Mine was a couple months ago.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.120
We need to fix that!

33:33.120 --> 33:34.120
I guess so.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.000
You know, Megsy hasn't seen Labyrinth.

33:37.000 --> 33:45.120
Anyways, something else that kind of stinks is the Circuit City Paper Mario guarantee.

33:45.120 --> 33:53.340
Basically, their guarantee, at least in print, was that if you arrive at the store, if Super

33:53.340 --> 33:59.560
Paper Mario is not in the store or street date by 2pm, then you get $20 in a gift card.

33:59.560 --> 34:03.960
Well, the problem was that someone actually went there and saw that Super Paper Mario

34:03.960 --> 34:11.360
was sold out, but the thing was, they had Super Paper Mario in earlier, so therefore

34:11.360 --> 34:12.360
they don't get $20.

34:12.360 --> 34:16.280
It's kind of like, well, we had it, but you just weren't here.

34:16.280 --> 34:20.000
What was to stop them from telling everybody that?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Nothing.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.400
Nothing at all.

34:23.400 --> 34:24.480
Aha!

34:24.480 --> 34:25.480
So it was a scam.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.480
Yes.

34:26.480 --> 34:35.640
Did he call the Better Business Bureau, or did he just post his angry rant on the internet

34:35.640 --> 34:37.640
and telling everyone to dig it?

34:37.640 --> 34:40.000
Angry rant on the internet and telling everyone to dig it.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.320
Going to the Better Business Bureau and having everybody going to the Better Business Bureau

34:43.320 --> 34:46.440
instead of dig probably would have been a little more effective, because I don't think

34:46.440 --> 34:49.880
the Better Business Bureau reads Joystik, Kotaku, and Destructoid.

34:49.880 --> 34:54.720
Or even better, maybe, I don't know, let's flashback to say when the Wii came out, and

34:54.720 --> 34:58.240
I think there were similar situations with bundling and stuff like that.

34:58.240 --> 35:00.680
So are we surprised?

35:00.680 --> 35:01.680
No.

35:01.680 --> 35:02.680
Who cares?

35:02.680 --> 35:03.680
It's Super Paper Mario.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.680
It's like everywhere.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.040
If you don't get it, you know, it's...

35:08.040 --> 35:13.480
Act Deft and Chad is adamantly saying, sold out does not equal not in stock.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.680
Yeah, but what's to stop the Circuit City employee?

35:16.680 --> 35:19.560
You don't know any better walking into the store.

35:19.560 --> 35:26.440
You could walk in there at noon looking for the game and they could be all, oh, we sold

35:26.440 --> 35:27.440
out.

35:27.440 --> 35:28.960
There was a line.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.440
It's crazy.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.440
Yep.

35:31.440 --> 35:33.200
No gift card for you.

35:33.200 --> 35:38.160
Would you like to check out our CDs or a new HDTV or a replacement plan?

35:38.160 --> 35:41.880
The best part is, is all the time on those advertisements there's a little bit of small

35:41.880 --> 35:46.160
print that you got to read and that's, you know, the offers can change without notice.

35:46.160 --> 35:51.520
So ha, they can say, oh, we'll give you free prostitutes, you know, if you come by Super

35:51.520 --> 35:52.520
Paper Mario.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.920
They don't have to, you know, follow that.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.680
They can just say, fuck you, bitch, I ain't doing shit.

35:57.680 --> 36:03.580
So could we post a big ad on the internet somewhere that says Orange Lounge Radio gives

36:03.580 --> 36:09.000
free blowjobs and then like in little fine print lie.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
This is a lie.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
What, Rice Princess?

36:11.000 --> 36:13.480
But that would be true on your behalf.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.480
I'm sorry.

36:14.480 --> 36:17.440
Rice Princess, it actually does give out free blowjobs to all of our.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.440
But on your behalf.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.440
It's your slut.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.440
Oops.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.440
I mean, hi.

36:21.440 --> 36:28.720
This train wreck brought to you by Rice Princess.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.720
Thank you.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.720
Shut up.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.720
Thank you for ruining our program.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.720
Uh-huh.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.720
I'm going to go now.

36:33.720 --> 36:34.720
So hi everyone and bye.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.720
All right.

36:35.720 --> 36:36.720
Wow.

36:36.720 --> 36:45.280
Raven's dolphin says, I want one, Rice Princess.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.800
Sometimes I wish our mics were more sensitive.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.200
You should have heard what she yelled.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.200
Anyhow.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.200
Wait, wait, wait.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.200
Let me, let me simulate it.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.200
Oh, what?

36:53.200 --> 36:54.200
Ew!

36:54.200 --> 36:55.200
How was that?

36:55.200 --> 36:56.200
That was good.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.200
That was good.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.040
A little less angry next time though.

37:00.040 --> 37:04.640
Well, God, where the hell do we begin with this one?

37:04.640 --> 37:12.040
Speaking of blowjobs for exchange for something, an ad went on Craigslist earlier this week

37:12.040 --> 37:16.760
on the 8th, actually about a week ago today, it was on the 8th and it was this woman making

37:16.760 --> 37:24.340
a post there saying, hello, I need 5,000 world of gold for my epic flying mount.

37:24.340 --> 37:27.520
In return, you can mount me.

37:27.520 --> 37:33.720
You have to be on the Laughing Skull server and I want the 5,000, excuse me, I want the

37:33.720 --> 37:36.100
5,000 gold before we do anything.

37:36.100 --> 37:39.400
We can make the trade at your place since I can't host.

37:39.400 --> 37:43.680
So seriously, she goes on to say, I play a level 70 night elf druid and would prefer

37:43.680 --> 37:45.200
someone who is into role playing.

37:45.200 --> 37:47.440
I have a costume.

37:47.440 --> 37:50.600
But honestly, anyone will do as long as you have the gold.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.680
I would also be okay with a woman too as long as you have the gold.

37:54.680 --> 37:59.620
Also not adverse to the idea of groups or anal.

37:59.620 --> 38:10.520
So other words, short translation, I'm a big slut who likes WoW too much and I don't even

38:10.520 --> 38:11.520
know where to go with this.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.640
It's prostitution.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.940
Pretty much.

38:13.940 --> 38:17.080
But she gets away with it because A, it's on the internet, I'm assuming she doesn't

38:17.080 --> 38:18.080
live in Nevada.

38:18.080 --> 38:21.680
I don't know what Craigslist site it was posted on but I don't think it was Vegas and anyway,

38:21.680 --> 38:23.460
it's illegal within the city limits of Vegas anyway.

38:23.460 --> 38:28.720
So it was probably illegal but she gets away with it because it's the internet and it's

38:28.720 --> 38:32.640
not real money.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.640
Would you...

38:33.640 --> 38:35.720
It's offering sex for services so...

38:35.720 --> 38:38.800
Would you give amount for amount?

38:38.800 --> 38:41.200
No, Rob.

38:41.200 --> 38:46.160
Well, for those of you that like to tease and taunt this woman and obviously her picture

38:46.160 --> 38:51.840
was all over the internet because you look at the picture and you kind of go, eh, you

38:51.840 --> 38:55.240
kind of see her and she ain't all that.

38:55.240 --> 38:58.360
No, not at all.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.360
But this is the thing.

38:59.360 --> 39:02.280
Just a couple days later, there was a follow up post.

39:02.280 --> 39:05.920
Hi, I just like to thank all the jackasses that thought it would be funny to post my

39:05.920 --> 39:09.600
picture all over the internet and make 50,000 threads about me on the WoW forums.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.280
I got my epic mount in about an hour.

39:12.280 --> 39:16.120
That was very enjoyable for both parties while all of you idiots probably spent hundreds

39:16.120 --> 39:18.680
of hours farming for years or don't even have them.

39:18.680 --> 39:22.880
I won't be revealing my name or his but suffice to say if I find any of you in game, I'll

39:22.880 --> 39:26.280
be killing you 280% faster.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.640
That's a little WoW joke there.

39:27.640 --> 39:34.200
Also, my new friend would also like to tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.640
She said it twice and capitalized it both times so I was reading it that way.

39:37.640 --> 39:40.560
Tell all you punks to take a hike, punks.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.040
I'm planning to meet him again later this week.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.380
He's getting double value for his gold.

39:45.380 --> 39:46.800
So talk all the trash you want.

39:46.800 --> 39:51.960
I got my epic flying mount and I got laid, which is more than most of you failures can

39:51.960 --> 39:52.960
ever hope for.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.200
Well, she does make a point.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.880
As long as she's got a good attitude about it.

39:57.880 --> 40:03.840
As long as she gets her epic mount, that way she can defend herself from the ugly sick

40:03.840 --> 40:07.000
because it looks like she's been beat down with it a few thousand times.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Okay, wait, wait.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.840
Away from the personal attacks for a minute.

40:09.840 --> 40:17.640
Let's say this had been a very Angelina Jolie but blonde, big, big titties posting this.

40:17.640 --> 40:18.960
That still doesn't make it right.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.240
Yeah, because especially since the amount of money that they're talking about 5,000

40:22.240 --> 40:25.320
gold I think equals about $600 in real money.

40:25.320 --> 40:30.800
Shit, you could get a lot more sex for a lot less money if you really wanted to go that

40:30.800 --> 40:31.800
route.

40:31.800 --> 40:34.280
Jamie, it almost sounds like at the end there you're kind of condoning it a little bit.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.240
Like, you know, as long as they're both happy.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.240
You okay with it?

40:37.240 --> 40:39.240
I have absolutely no problem with prostitution.

40:39.240 --> 40:40.240
Seriously.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.240
Well.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.240
No, seriously, and I'll tell you why.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.600
I think I got a 20 in my wallet.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.600
No.

40:46.600 --> 40:49.640
Can I prostitute you to clean my kitchen?

40:49.640 --> 40:50.640
Fuck you.

40:50.640 --> 40:57.960
No, but I think, you know, and I'm saying this, and, you know, it's also not just because

40:57.960 --> 41:01.720
I watched the prostitution episode of bullshit last night either.

41:01.720 --> 41:13.380
But I believe that, you know, if done in a, I'm trying to think about how to say this.

41:13.380 --> 41:18.120
If you are taking the proper precautions to stay clean, to protect yourself from unwanted

41:18.120 --> 41:22.440
pregnancy and STDs, and you're getting something out of it.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.440
It's your choice.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.680
Who has the right to tell you what to do with your body?

41:25.680 --> 41:28.040
That's what I say.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.040
But I don't know.

41:29.040 --> 41:33.280
I mean, like, yeah, I'm all for, like, you know, whatever two people do amongst closed

41:33.280 --> 41:34.960
doors and whatever, whatever makes them happy.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.400
You know, I don't care.

41:36.400 --> 41:41.120
But yet something still strikes me as really, really wrong about this, and I can't put my

41:41.120 --> 41:42.760
finger on it.

41:42.760 --> 41:46.640
Like you just kind of like, ah, that's just not right.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.640
That's not right.

41:47.640 --> 41:50.280
I'm trying to put out for wow.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.280
It is sad.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.280
For wow, Jamie.

41:52.280 --> 41:56.440
People put out for 360s and PlayStation 3s and Wii, so.

41:56.440 --> 42:02.540
You know, I'm not saying that it's sad.

42:02.540 --> 42:05.260
I think that someone is desperate enough.

42:05.260 --> 42:08.840
But honestly, more power to her, you know.

42:08.840 --> 42:14.480
If she says, you know what, I have no problem with, you know, giving it up a little bit

42:14.480 --> 42:15.480
for a mountain.

42:15.480 --> 42:24.040
You know, I think that it's actually no different than the eBay people, honestly.

42:24.040 --> 42:28.240
I mean, I would think that, I would say the sad part is that she didn't actually do anything

42:28.240 --> 42:30.680
to actually earn it, you know.

42:30.680 --> 42:33.640
Like in game, like everybody else does.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.640
But at the same time.

42:34.640 --> 42:38.680
But there's a lot of people that buy gold from the, you know, IG type websites and all

42:38.680 --> 42:39.680
that, anyway.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.680
Right?

42:40.680 --> 42:42.080
It's pretty much, it's pretty much the same thing.

42:42.080 --> 42:47.160
For 600 fucking dollars, that sex better be mind-fucking-blowing.

42:47.160 --> 42:52.320
It better be something that sticks in my mind for until the day I die.

42:52.320 --> 42:55.160
Well, how about it being blogged about on every website on the internet?

42:55.160 --> 42:56.160
I don't know.

42:56.160 --> 42:59.560
Well, no, it doesn't matter though, because, you know, having sex with some ugly, older

42:59.560 --> 43:03.320
chick and the way she has that fucking nappy, long-ass hair, ooh.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.040
But anyways, hey, great.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.440
I was hoping to get her on the show for an interview, well, so much for that, Loki ruined

43:08.440 --> 43:09.440
those chances.

43:09.440 --> 43:11.440
That's fine, I'll talk to her.

43:11.440 --> 43:15.560
Dark Knight says I'm doing a PSA.

43:15.560 --> 43:18.760
I'm looking, let's see, what else in chat here?

43:18.760 --> 43:24.240
GS68 says, woman having sex with men does not equal a slut as long as she's joining.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.160
I'm not sure if, oh, I think it's unequal too.

43:26.160 --> 43:30.280
No, no, no, no, no, there's a difference between a slut and a whore.

43:30.280 --> 43:31.640
Sluts do it for free, whores get paid.

43:31.640 --> 43:32.640
That's true.

43:32.640 --> 43:33.640
So she was being a whore.

43:33.640 --> 43:34.640
She was being a whore.

43:34.640 --> 43:35.640
World of Warcraft.

43:35.640 --> 43:36.640
She wasn't a slut, she was a whore.

43:36.640 --> 43:37.640
Big difference.

43:37.640 --> 43:38.640
But you, but again.

43:38.640 --> 43:43.200
Is he, I don't know if GS68 might be making the point, if it was a man, would anyone have

43:43.200 --> 43:44.200
cared?

43:44.200 --> 43:45.200
Men can be, there's male prostitutes.

43:45.200 --> 43:46.200
They're whores.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.200
Well, I know that.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.680
There's people who give up the butt love for money.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.560
I said that a little way too easily, didn't I?

43:50.560 --> 43:51.560
I know that.

43:51.560 --> 43:56.040
I mean, I read about it on the internet, of course.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.600
I get it for free, okay?

43:57.600 --> 44:03.880
I did think it was funny, though, because I've been chatting off and on with sauce over

44:03.880 --> 44:05.440
AIM, which I'm not on.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
Nobody IM me.

44:07.440 --> 44:13.400
Um, just that, you know, because it's legal in Nevada, and it's actually a good source

44:13.400 --> 44:16.400
of income, and it's safe and clean.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.800
I don't even have letters on this one.

44:17.800 --> 44:22.600
To be honest, I mean, seriously, this stuff happens all the time in fucking Second Life

44:22.600 --> 44:27.640
and shit like that, and no one, it just happens so often now that no one really gives a shit.

44:27.640 --> 44:28.640
This, I mean...

44:28.640 --> 44:31.600
In a way, all she did was cut out the middle man.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.600
I mean, really.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.760
I mean, if not this, then what?

44:34.760 --> 44:35.760
She could have been a stripper.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.960
She would have stripped for cash, just used the cash to buy the gold for my GE.

44:39.960 --> 44:40.960
There you go.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.460
All she's doing, she's cutting out the middle man.

44:42.460 --> 44:45.000
She's going straight from stripping to her mount.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.380
It's the same difference as saying, you know, I'll help you with your levels if you help

44:49.380 --> 44:51.600
me get my mount.

44:51.600 --> 44:53.400
It's an exchange of services.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.840
It's just bringing it from...

44:55.840 --> 44:57.920
Bringing power leveling to a whole new meaning.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.720
She couldn't have done stripping.

44:59.720 --> 45:00.720
Uh-uh.

45:00.720 --> 45:06.680
I, I say it was her choice to do it, you know, if anyone's going to judge her, you know,

45:06.680 --> 45:10.000
look at the own shit you do in your life and see how much you can, you can afford to judge

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
somebody else.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
That's what I say.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Okay, put it this way.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.440
Let me lay it out to you straight here.

45:15.440 --> 45:21.640
She's a 31-year-old woman who cosplays World of Warcraft.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.640
So is she.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.480
I'm a 31-year-old woman who cosplays Naruto.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
What's your point?

45:26.480 --> 45:32.440
Yeah, but you don't have sex with fucking teenagers or whatever for a goddamn mount.

45:32.440 --> 45:36.640
Well, she has sex with Dan and he buys her games.

45:36.640 --> 45:37.640
I mean...

45:37.640 --> 45:40.920
Yeah, but I married him.

45:40.920 --> 45:41.920
That's why Jamie has...

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
Wait!

45:42.920 --> 45:45.040
I'm not, I'm not 31 yet.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.800
That's why Jamie has the sympathy here.

45:47.800 --> 45:48.800
No.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.800
I'm just teasing.

45:49.800 --> 45:50.800
Obviously, there's a big difference.

45:50.800 --> 45:51.800
No, that's wrong.

45:51.800 --> 45:52.800
I know it is.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.800
I'm not 31 yet, by the way.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.800
Okay, well there you go.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.800
Four days!

45:56.800 --> 45:57.800
Stop it!

45:57.800 --> 46:01.760
I have, I have 2 AM on Thursday, so just be nice to me.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.080
What if this chick's got like fucking kids and stuff?

46:04.080 --> 46:05.080
I mean, because...

46:05.080 --> 46:06.400
Mommy, what are you doing?

46:06.400 --> 46:10.320
Oh yeah, no money for baby formula, but hey.

46:10.320 --> 46:11.320
At least I got my mount.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.840
All right, this topic's gone on way too long.

46:13.840 --> 46:14.840
We can bring it up in Skype.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.840
I'm learning it later.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.400
Hey, I have something interesting to talk about.

46:17.400 --> 46:18.400
Please.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.800
I've even eaten all the fucking Pocky.

46:20.800 --> 46:21.800
It's good.

46:21.800 --> 46:26.440
I know, I found a different type of crushed Pocky that's cookies and cream.

46:26.440 --> 46:27.440
Anyway.

46:27.440 --> 46:34.600
So, all of us are really, really excited about Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360, right?

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
Right?

46:35.600 --> 46:39.240
No, actually, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360 is pretty rad.

46:39.240 --> 46:40.240
I really like it.

46:40.240 --> 46:48.200
Well, you can actually get the song packs now for $6.25 for three songs.

46:48.200 --> 46:54.160
So it's 500 points, the three packs are Pack 1 is Bark at the Moon, Hey You, and Ace of

46:54.160 --> 46:55.160
Spades.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.600
Pack 2 is Killer Queen, Take It Off, and Frankenstein.

46:57.600 --> 47:02.440
Pack 3 is Higher Ground, Infected, and Stellar, which for me, at the top of all of those was

47:02.440 --> 47:04.120
you know, Pack 1 for me.

47:04.120 --> 47:06.880
You know, at least two good songs in there.

47:06.880 --> 47:11.240
But you're basically playing about two bucks a song.

47:11.240 --> 47:16.160
And the interesting thing that was, you know, they're gonna keep having these packs on here.

47:16.160 --> 47:19.480
If they're gonna be that much, you're gonna end up actually spending a lot of money to

47:19.480 --> 47:21.880
get some of these extra songs for packs of three.

47:21.880 --> 47:27.680
Ooh, ooh, ooh, can I rant and echo the sentiments of the rest of the entire internet right now?

47:27.680 --> 47:29.280
Go ahead.

47:29.280 --> 47:31.540
This is bullshit!

47:31.540 --> 47:34.800
Because the Guitar Hero 1 costs what?

47:34.800 --> 47:37.880
Like 59 bucks for the guitar and the game, right?

47:37.880 --> 47:38.880
Guitar and game?

47:38.880 --> 47:39.880
No, maybe 69.

47:39.880 --> 47:40.880
I don't remember.

47:40.880 --> 47:41.880
Yeah, it was pretty expensive.

47:41.880 --> 47:47.160
It was $93, which is if Red Octane continues to price the song packs at this price, you

47:47.160 --> 47:52.720
will be paying to have Guitar Hero 1 inside Guitar Hero 2.

47:52.720 --> 47:53.720
That's hot.

47:53.720 --> 47:54.720
No, it's not.

47:54.720 --> 48:02.280
It's stupid, and the sad thing is, I am so tempted to still buy one of these packs, because

48:02.280 --> 48:07.760
I do kind of want to play the songs on the Xbox 360, and like, I hate myself for it.

48:07.760 --> 48:10.280
And Red Octane knows that they can get away with charging it.

48:10.280 --> 48:13.960
This is the milking of the franchise that's going to lead to its death.

48:13.960 --> 48:18.040
This is why Harmonix is jumping ship and starting a new game.

48:18.040 --> 48:21.320
Because they know this is going to be too much of a good thing in all these downloaded

48:21.320 --> 48:22.320
pullbacks.

48:22.320 --> 48:23.320
Right.

48:23.320 --> 48:30.020
Yeah, they're really just jumping ship because they're totally not going to milk the franchise

48:30.020 --> 48:35.720
by creating a whole band simulator, which will have fucking billions of downloads for

48:35.720 --> 48:36.720
it.

48:36.720 --> 48:37.880
This works for Harmonix, though.

48:37.880 --> 48:41.640
If you think about it, Loki, they rip themselves off with Guitar Freaks.

48:41.640 --> 48:42.640
Guitar Freaks is what?

48:42.640 --> 48:44.840
It's amplitude with a guitar controller.

48:44.840 --> 48:45.840
Kinda.

48:45.840 --> 48:46.840
Right?

48:46.840 --> 48:47.840
Guitar Hero?

48:47.840 --> 48:48.840
Yeah.

48:48.840 --> 48:50.320
Or did I say Guitar Freaks?

48:50.320 --> 48:51.320
Yeah.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.320
Whatever.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.320
Well, hell, there's that too.

48:53.320 --> 48:56.240
Guitar Freaks plus amplitude equals Guitar Hero, pretty much.

48:56.240 --> 48:57.240
Right?

48:57.240 --> 48:58.240
Am I right?

48:58.240 --> 48:59.240
Yeah.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
All right.

49:00.240 --> 49:01.240
There you go.

49:01.240 --> 49:04.340
But what I don't understand is that why, if we're going to pay this kind of money for

49:04.340 --> 49:07.440
these songs, why not give us new songs?

49:07.440 --> 49:13.380
I bet people may not have complained so much if you would have given new songs.

49:13.380 --> 49:17.340
I mean, I realize that these old songs are probably, you know, they're already done and

49:17.340 --> 49:18.560
they're easy to copy over.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.640
Well, then they should be cheap.

49:20.640 --> 49:23.840
Because if you want me to spend two bucks for the song, I mean, God, iTunes charges

49:23.840 --> 49:27.360
like 99 cents a song and those songs are way better produced.

49:27.360 --> 49:31.120
Okay, granted, you have to pay somebody to do all the notes and blah, blah, blah, digital

49:31.120 --> 49:34.480
distribution fees, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, but still for $2, I know

49:34.480 --> 49:38.760
you're going to turn a profit by doing some new songs.

49:38.760 --> 49:43.240
Guitar Hero 2 is kind of lacking in contemporary songs from the past five years.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.760
Why can't you, you know, throw some of those?

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
Throw a classic pack up.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.760
Why even do the packs at all?

49:49.760 --> 49:52.040
Some of those songs kind of suck and I don't want them.

49:52.040 --> 49:53.040
Exactly.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.040
That's why they're doing that.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.080
Like I want Killer Queen, but I don't want the other ones in that pack.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.960
I want the Red Hot Chili Peppers one.

49:57.960 --> 49:58.960
It's ah.

49:58.960 --> 49:59.960
You have to buy all of them.

49:59.960 --> 50:04.960
Now, here's what I say, you can put the packs up, but make it, you know, some sort of discount

50:04.960 --> 50:07.520
over like say buying each song individually.

50:07.520 --> 50:12.480
Say if you want to buy, make each song, you know, buck 25 or something like that, you

50:12.480 --> 50:14.520
know, then that's not so bad.

50:14.520 --> 50:18.000
It's still bad, but it's not so bad.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.960
And then that way you save a little bit of money buying, you know, you know, one song

50:22.960 --> 50:27.360
over or buying the pack if you really do want all three songs.

50:27.360 --> 50:31.160
The Rob D is making some interesting points in our chat, chat.ornisandrea.com.

50:31.160 --> 50:34.920
I think the rhythm games turn into a song upgrade eventually.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.800
There's just not much you can do about it.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.640
It's not like you can innovate a guitar.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.400
It's Tony Hawk syndrome.

50:40.400 --> 50:47.240
Well, but in a way, in a way, Red Octane did kind of innovate on what already existed as

50:47.240 --> 50:49.100
the Guitar Freaks guitar.

50:49.100 --> 50:52.220
And you sort of saw it coming, like, you know, we've obviously been following rhythm games

50:52.220 --> 50:53.220
a long time.

50:53.220 --> 50:57.340
Remember Red Octane put out four Guitar Freaks because what did they do before they made

50:57.340 --> 50:58.340
games?

50:58.340 --> 51:02.400
They were, they were a big rental company who made a huge, huge chunk of their income

51:02.400 --> 51:07.440
off of music games, economy's beat mania series and all the, all the songs there.

51:07.440 --> 51:13.040
They originally put out a Guitar Freaks controller with five buttons and everybody always asks,

51:13.040 --> 51:14.040
why did they put five?

51:14.040 --> 51:17.880
Because Guitar Freaks only has three and everybody said, why is there five buttons on this controller?

51:17.880 --> 51:18.880
Why?

51:18.880 --> 51:23.520
And everybody speculated, Oh, Guitar Freaks, like super Guitar Freaks on PlayStation two,

51:23.520 --> 51:27.120
they're super duper Guitar Freaks is going to use all five buttons and Red Octane knows

51:27.120 --> 51:28.120
that.

51:28.120 --> 51:30.280
Well, Red Octane was just planning Guitar Hero years ago.

51:30.280 --> 51:33.600
Well, here's, here's the, here's the other thing that you should even get more pissed

51:33.600 --> 51:34.600
off about.

51:34.600 --> 51:38.640
I don't know if some people may have seen this in the forums, how, and I mentioned a

51:38.640 --> 51:45.480
little on top of the show, how I built my own Guitar Hero effects pedal.

51:45.480 --> 51:50.920
Basically the thing, which is going to be a yet another purchase is just a fucking push

51:50.920 --> 51:52.360
button switch.

51:52.360 --> 51:57.480
It's something very simple that, I mean, should I wear it up in about five minutes, that you're

51:57.480 --> 51:58.640
going to have to buy.

51:58.640 --> 52:02.180
And that's going to be in addition to, you know, the guitar and everything.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.080
So they say they sell for 10 bucks.

52:04.080 --> 52:08.480
There's another 10 bucks you're paying for a fucking button for something that, and granted

52:08.480 --> 52:12.480
it's probably not necessary, but near are the song packs and yet it's something extra

52:12.480 --> 52:14.680
that you're going to be buying.

52:14.680 --> 52:17.280
So there you go.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.280
Wonderful.

52:18.280 --> 52:22.160
And the pedal doesn't really do anything yet because it's not implemented in the game,

52:22.160 --> 52:23.160
but it works.

52:23.160 --> 52:27.000
I know that for a fact.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.400
I do agree that other music game series have become stagnant as well.

52:30.400 --> 52:35.640
I love DDR, I really do, but it is starting to get kind of old.

52:35.640 --> 52:39.720
I really feel like, you know, obviously it's inevitable there's going to be more DDR games

52:39.720 --> 52:40.720
this year.

52:40.720 --> 52:45.920
It's just a question of what, and I just feel like I'm not that excited about it anymore

52:45.920 --> 52:51.040
because like I've said on this program a while ago, my idea, and you know, granted you don't

52:51.040 --> 52:53.200
have to use this idea, this is just an idea.

52:53.200 --> 52:58.440
You could innovate DDR by making it a more competitive game, like the whole dance magic

52:58.440 --> 53:02.120
mode from DDR Disney and battle mode in Supernova.

53:02.120 --> 53:04.680
Battle mode in Supernova was just kind of like an afterthought.

53:04.680 --> 53:09.320
It was kind of just quickly done, sloppily done, whatever, and it was in the groove,

53:09.320 --> 53:10.320
same thing.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.320
It had a similar mode in there.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.360
It was just kind of an afterthought.

53:13.360 --> 53:17.880
Really put some time and energy into a battle mode with, you know, your character select

53:17.880 --> 53:23.420
and, you know, I don't know, this whole like you got served kind of atmosphere there.

53:23.420 --> 53:27.080
There could be a really fun game in there that's a little more competitive, and that's

53:27.080 --> 53:29.400
a way you could innovate DDR, but I don't know.

53:29.400 --> 53:32.880
If they continue to sell a million copies of the game, well, DDR Supernova was one of

53:32.880 --> 53:34.600
the top 25 selling games last year.

53:34.600 --> 53:39.120
If you can continue to make a profit by putting out the same old crap with new tunes, I guess

53:39.120 --> 53:40.840
why bother innovating?

53:40.840 --> 53:42.840
Cost money to innovate.

53:42.840 --> 53:47.920
Anyways, speaking of- Our topics are taking too long tonight, my bad.

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
Sorry.

53:48.920 --> 53:53.800
Well, also coming to Xbox Live Arcade, Super Contra, and this is according to the ESRB.

53:53.800 --> 53:57.280
They have a rating now for it for the 360, so yay.

53:57.280 --> 54:00.520
I think this was one that was announced, I want to say, at E3 last year.

54:00.520 --> 54:07.360
I could have sworn it was announced, but yeah, now it's coming, so no big surprise.

54:07.360 --> 54:13.200
I want to say that when we saw that arcade montage, that there was Super Contra mixed

54:13.200 --> 54:15.080
in with regular Contra or something.

54:15.080 --> 54:16.080
Yeah.

54:16.080 --> 54:17.080
Is it super regular?

54:17.080 --> 54:18.440
Does it take Metamucil?

54:18.440 --> 54:21.440
Shut up.

54:21.440 --> 54:27.520
This is a game, after that little comment, I will want to play Jamie with her on Xbox

54:27.520 --> 54:28.520
Live Arcade.

54:28.520 --> 54:29.520
Quake 3.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.520
Who?

54:30.520 --> 54:34.320
Because I want to kill her with a rocket launcher over and over again.

54:34.320 --> 54:35.320
No.

54:35.320 --> 54:37.320
I'll actually literally throw up on you because of the motion.

54:37.320 --> 54:38.320
That's it.

54:38.320 --> 54:41.960
How long can you play before you start getting sick?

54:41.960 --> 54:44.760
Because 30 seconds is all it takes for me to blow you up.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.840
Can you just turn on your machine and sit there?

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
About five minutes.

54:47.840 --> 54:48.840
All right.

54:48.840 --> 54:49.840
Well, good.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.840
Five minutes.

54:50.840 --> 54:51.840
I can get five frags on you at least.

54:51.840 --> 54:52.840
I'm really good at Quake.

54:52.840 --> 54:53.840
All right.

54:53.840 --> 54:54.840
Well, we'll put that to the test.

54:54.840 --> 54:55.840
I was a pro at Gotchum on Quake.

54:55.840 --> 54:56.840
Gotchum on Quake?

54:56.840 --> 54:57.840
Yep.

54:57.840 --> 54:58.840
I don't even want to know.

54:58.840 --> 54:59.840
And I can actually play the...

54:59.840 --> 55:00.840
I don't even want to know.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.280
But anyway, so what am I talking about?

55:03.280 --> 55:10.080
The ESRB has recently leaked a rating for Quake 3 Team Arena with a rating of M, of

55:10.080 --> 55:11.080
course.

55:11.080 --> 55:16.680
But for the Xbox 360, now seeing as Quake 4 has already been released, it's a regular

55:16.680 --> 55:18.800
game and it wasn't that great.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.400
Quake 2 was already on there too.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.320
And Quake 2 was on the disc as well.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.320
Where does Quake 3 fit?

55:23.320 --> 55:24.320
And Quake...

55:24.320 --> 55:28.080
Well, I guess the original Quake hasn't been released yet, but Doom did and Doom had a

55:28.080 --> 55:29.220
lot of success.

55:29.220 --> 55:34.960
So you kind of think that, hey, Quake 3, logically, is going to go to Xbox Live Arcade, huh?

55:34.960 --> 55:37.560
So we'll see.

55:37.560 --> 55:42.040
I think the recent file size increase on Xbox Live would make it very plausible.

55:42.040 --> 55:44.040
It's probably the only thing that was possible before.

55:44.040 --> 55:46.040
No, downloadable mods would be great.

55:46.040 --> 55:47.600
Oh, that would be awesome.

55:47.600 --> 55:51.280
That would be cool if, like, when they released this, they put downloadable mods.

55:51.280 --> 55:56.560
They should have a way to do fan-made mods and then have them available through Live.

55:56.560 --> 55:58.760
Well, Unreal Tournament's going to do that, so...

55:58.760 --> 55:59.760
Well...

55:59.760 --> 56:01.400
You only have a few more months for that.

56:01.400 --> 56:04.640
Well, here's some other news, though.

56:04.640 --> 56:10.560
For anyone who has been keeping up with Lost Planet, it's getting a PC release that will

56:10.560 --> 56:17.800
be available in Europe and America in June.

56:17.800 --> 56:24.680
They were not giving too much, too many details as far as when it will actually be available

56:24.680 --> 56:27.080
in Europe, though.

56:27.080 --> 56:35.360
But it's going to be a Windows Vista title that's using DirectX 10 and will be able to

56:35.360 --> 56:46.200
go as high resolution as 2560 by 1600 pixels, so that's pretty cool.

56:46.200 --> 56:53.700
But also, the thing about this is that it's sort of contradicting what Capcom's saying

56:53.700 --> 56:57.240
that Lost Planet was only going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive.

56:57.240 --> 56:58.880
Yeah, but that may be console, though.

56:58.880 --> 57:02.400
Yeah, so is Gears of War.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.400
We all know we're going to get that eventually, too.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.040
And Halo is exclusive.

57:06.040 --> 57:08.560
Yeah, we got that on PC as well.

57:08.560 --> 57:10.400
It's exclusive to just be released.

57:10.400 --> 57:14.160
It's exclusive to Microsoft's Empire, which, you know, that's fine, whatever, it's their

57:14.160 --> 57:15.160
IP.

57:15.160 --> 57:16.160
Yeah, that does make sense.

57:16.160 --> 57:20.640
I mean, Microsoft can say, oh, well, we're going to put it on PC, too, and it's still

57:20.640 --> 57:22.440
a Microsoft product, so yeah, that makes sense.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.240
Yeah, it's not like you're going to see it on a Mac.

57:24.240 --> 57:28.720
Well, a lot of times the exclusive stuff is when they're talking about just, like, consoles.

57:28.720 --> 57:34.120
They're not really referring to PCs, because I think they don't really generally kind of

57:34.120 --> 57:38.240
compete with PCs as far as platforms, I would think.

57:38.240 --> 57:41.280
PC gamers and console gamers are usually very different types.

57:41.280 --> 57:46.000
I mean, like, say me, I definitely consider myself a console gamer, but I do play PC games

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
now and again.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.600
You know, obviously World of Warcraft, but besides, outside of that, I play an occasional

57:51.600 --> 57:55.960
PC game, and I think most hardcore PC gamers kind of feel the same way, like, yeah, I play

57:55.960 --> 57:59.120
mostly PC games, but I'll try out a console once in a while.

57:59.120 --> 58:03.600
You know, I have a PlayStation, you know, I play games on once in a while.

58:03.600 --> 58:04.600
Yeah.

58:04.600 --> 58:10.760
Well, one PC game, and I actually tried playing this this week, but Dance Online, it's claims

58:10.760 --> 58:15.160
new kind of DDR multiplayer online game.

58:15.160 --> 58:18.000
You know, think Ota Jam, something like that.

58:18.000 --> 58:22.800
Anyways, it's free to play, and it's available online, I believe it's acclaimed.com slash

58:22.800 --> 58:27.600
dance, and you can actually check it out.

58:27.600 --> 58:31.160
I don't know if they're going to be doing kind of the Ota Jam thing where you can buy

58:31.160 --> 58:35.800
costumes and crap to customize your avatar, that kind of thing, but apparently you're

58:35.800 --> 58:43.000
going to be able to actually win signed, you know, stuff from actually playing the game,

58:43.000 --> 58:47.400
so that might be kind of neat, or it's probably going to be ad-supported or something like

58:47.400 --> 58:50.080
that, so I don't know.

58:50.080 --> 58:53.720
That's good that it's free, because I played the beta a few months ago, and I'll be honest,

58:53.720 --> 58:54.800
I don't really remember it.

58:54.800 --> 58:59.080
I reviewed it on the show, but I couldn't tell you when, and it was not something I

58:59.080 --> 59:03.200
would have paid for, so I'm glad to hear they're putting it out for free, and sure, this whole,

59:03.200 --> 59:06.360
you know, pay for customization, sure, there's people that are into that, they'll make money

59:06.360 --> 59:07.360
from it.

59:07.360 --> 59:08.360
Advertising, sure, what the hell.

59:08.360 --> 59:12.720
You know, how about have certain bands pay to get their songs in there?

59:12.720 --> 59:15.680
I'll bet you that's what they'll end up doing, something like that.

59:15.680 --> 59:16.680
Why not?

59:16.680 --> 59:21.800
Why don't they do that with Guitar Hero, like have stuff, you know, sponsored by different

59:21.800 --> 59:22.800
things?

59:22.800 --> 59:26.280
Well, they have a lot of indie bands in Guitar Hero, which is actually kind of cool.

59:26.280 --> 59:29.200
You would think that they could put out a couple free packs of just indie bands who

59:29.200 --> 59:31.280
want to get out there and exposed.

59:31.280 --> 59:34.000
I don't know.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
It's still early, though.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
I mean...

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
It is.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.280
I mean, this could be very much like Horse Armor for Guitar Hero 2, and you know, they

59:41.280 --> 59:43.560
haven't quite figured it out yet or something to that.

59:43.560 --> 59:47.320
I actually read that comparison on some blog somewhere, somebody was calling this Red Octane's

59:47.320 --> 59:50.520
Horse Armor, and I could see that.

59:50.520 --> 59:55.880
And certainly Oblivion, actually, you know, I'll give it this, Oblivion got torn into

59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.040
a new one across the internet for the whole Horse Armor thing, and they fixed it in a

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.040
big way.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.200
I mean, and honestly, Oblivion has the best downloadable content of any title.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.480
It's the most supported in the realm of downloadable content.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.480
I mean, wouldn't you agree?

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.480
Yeah.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.920
There's so much extra that's out there available for the game.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.120
So they did make right, eventually.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.040
So hopefully, Red Octane will follow in their footsteps and all will be forgiven.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.040
Hopefully.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.440
Hopefully.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.440
Hopefully you'll be able to pick up one of these in the near future.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.680
It's a keyboard for the Xbox 360, but I want you to think, it's a type of keyboard that

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.740
actually plugs into your controller.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.120
It's that typical QWERTY, is what they call it, the QWERTY keyboard, that actually plugs

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.200
into the bottom of your controller, so you can have it all right there in your hand.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.760
Now, I know what you might be thinking is, this is what I thought, is that, you know,

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.040
well, why the hell do you need one of these?

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.280
Because the Xbox 360 will actually take any USB keyboard, and it really will, because

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.080
I played Final Fantasy XI with a USB keyboard.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080
It was fine.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.840
Oh, I can pretty much, I have a keyboard plugged into my 360 too sometimes, and it's just a

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.840
pain in the ass to actually put the controller down, pick up the keyboard, type something,

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.520
put the keyboard back down.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.120
This would actually be pretty quick for me.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.800
Yeah, that's kind of the upside of it, because the thing about Final Fantasy XI is that since

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.680
it was basically ported from the PC version, PlayStation 2 or whatever, you could play

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.340
the game completely on the keyboard.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.520
The arrow keys would move your character, but obviously not every Xbox 360 game is going

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.560
to be built to do that, so you might need something like this in order to do that.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:33.440
And if you're playing an MMO, that's different than actually just texting somebody or just

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:37.400
typing something up in a chat window or something like that.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.320
That's completely different, because I wouldn't try to play an MMO with that thing, no way.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:46.600
But it's nice, that way I don't have to really take my hand off the controller.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:50.880
I can just type something real quick and go back to the game.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.480
I just hope it's not more than 20 bucks, because honestly, we'll get into the reason this is

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:04.640
coming out very soon, but it's not going to be worth it.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.040
I think Microsoft's pretty smart on their pricing for stuff, and it doesn't look like

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.040
it's that...

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:16.920
I'd say maybe $15, $20, $17.99 maybe, that's going to be my guess.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.580
We'll see.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:23.320
Going to the chat and seeing what the folks in chat are saying.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:30.800
Hostile One says, that looks useless to me, Jaded suggests a keyboard-mouse combo.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.640
Bonnie Dale says, in regards to the Oblivion content we were talking about earlier, it's

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.320
too bad that the downloadable content in Oblivion will destroy your game if you play it too

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.320
long.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.400
Oh, SSG100Mac makes a good suggestion for Guitar Hero.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.180
I'd pay to have the Advantage or the minibosses in Guitar Hero, too bad most of their songs

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.520
are covers of NES games, but hey, maybe they can work something out.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.160
What happened to the guitar version of the Halo theme being in there?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.320
Maybe that'll be downloadable content later on.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.720
Maybe around the time we start getting more Halo news, like the beta or the game, maybe

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.640
that'll be a downloadable song later on for free.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.680
Who knows?

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.220
We shall see.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:14.040
We shall also see right now what is waiting for us in the mailbag, because you kids can

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.480
email us every week at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.400
And DarkSakura likes to jump into the mailbag head first and pull out some of her favorite

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.680
emails to read with you folks here on air.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.600
So here we go, let's go into the mailbag.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:33.400
DarkSakura, who's on tap this week?

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.800
We got a bunch of crap, really.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:47.200
First email actually is a link from Heon.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:53.920
It's basically saying Tamiki Fighters, I'm not sure, but the point that I wanted to say

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.380
was actually in the email, it says, wanted to let you know about it, look, you probably

01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:04.680
already knew, love the show, but it needs more lesbians.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.040
Is that in our show role later on?

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.040
I don't remember.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:10.720
No, I guess Tamiki Fighters was officially announced this week for the Wii.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.080
No, it wasn't announced.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.120
It was found on Gamefly.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.200
Oh, okay.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.120
It was officially leaked on Gamefly.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120
I see.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:24.680
That was a very interesting thing for somebody to go to Gamefly and look for.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:29.840
I wonder what tipped them off.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:32.320
People are now checking Gamefly for all sorts of things.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.320
That's true.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:42.640
Anyway, we also have, actually our friend Rob with two Bs sent an email saying that

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:49.960
the FTC had provided evidence that the current self-regulation by the ESRB has significantly

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.040
improved and is better than other media.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:59.520
I'm going to link for the chat room an article from Ars Technica that goes into that.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.400
It's really long, but I thought it was pretty cool.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.600
They said that they're basically doing a better job than we are.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.040
Oops.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.960
No comment?

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960
I don't know.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.160
I like to think the game industry is doing a better job than most people give them credit

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.160
for.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.160
Yeah, I would agree with someone saying that.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.680
The rating system is broken.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.840
We all know that.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.040
We all know the rating system is broken, but the video game system somewhat seems to work.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.040
M for Mature and T for Teens.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:34.080
There's a good distinction there, whereas in the movie world, we have R. Granted, there's

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.720
PG-13, but you can get away with a lot.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.000
PG and PG-13, it's like it complies together.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's the same thing.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.960
Yeah, and R, there's such a vast difference between what is considered R. You have movies

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:51.920
like what's a really frickin' violent movie that's come out in the past few years?

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.880
I haven't seen it, but I imagine Grindhouse is pretty violent, right?

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:58.000
So you have Grindhouse on one end of the spectrum, and you have Romy and Michelle's High School

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.440
Reunion is also rated R, because the F word is used a couple times in it.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.440
Like fuck?

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.600
Yeah, the fuck word is used, like Janine Garofalo is in it.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:07.600
End of story.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:08.600
I love Janine Garofalo.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600
Who doesn't?

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:13.160
But the point is that those are very different kinds of movies.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.800
I would let my kid watch Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, okay?

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.480
A couple little fucks isn't going to kill them.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.480
No!

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.840
You hear the word fuck, and you suddenly want to kill people!

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.600
Yeah, but I would not let them watch Terminator 2.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600
I would.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.320
Well, you and I are different.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.880
Did I saw Terminator 2 in the theater?

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880
That was awesome.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.280
Anyway, next email.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.400
Hey guys, Sesha here.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:43.600
I was just wondering what is the opinion on Sony losing executives to Microsoft, and whether

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.760
it will really matter to them.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.920
I've heard that Final Fantasy XIII is still in talks, but the only reason that Sony may

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:55.560
be losing exclusivity for that is because it's costing Squeenix too much money to produce

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:59.320
games these days, so going multiplatform solves that problem.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.480
Excuse me.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.120
I also don't know if this is true, so don't quote me on it though.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.720
It's just something that I heard, and it makes sense.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.240
But anyway, if Final Fantasy XIII were multiplatform, do you think this would really affect the

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.520
sales of the PS3, or would it not really matter?

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.240
I'm not so sure myself, and thought I'd ask you guys.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.720
Thanks for keeping this show going and keeping the randomness of it all in, and a big shout

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720
to Irene.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.720
Heart.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.720
Oh, thank you.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.720
That was good timing.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.720
Yeah, she just watched in the room.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720
Take care, people.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.720
Stay fukin' epic.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.720
Love, Sesha.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.720
Aww, I thought he was going to leave a voicemail, that jerk.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.720
No, I'm kidding.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.720
Hi, Sesha.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:37.720
You're hot.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.720
I'm gonna go now.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.720
Bye.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:40.720
So?

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.720
Answer?

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:46.600
Well, of course they haven't announced anything official, but yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:51.080
if it does come to the 360, since more people have a 360.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:55.480
But then again, I mean, I don't know.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:08:01.760
If it did make it over to the 360, yeah, that'd be a big blow to Sony, because it would give

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:09.640
people yet one less excuse to buy a PlayStation 3, because it's like, if you don't have any

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:13.400
exclusive games, no one's really gonna want- I mean, they've got some pretty good exclusive

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:20.600
games with Microsoft, and it may not be something that everybody wants, but it's a lot less

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:25.240
exclusive games than, say, Sony has right now, and I don't know.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:31.040
I think it makes perfect sense to go multiplatform, but that hasn't really been Squeenix's track

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.600
record, though.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.680
They're definitely ones for exclusive content.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.680
Not necessarily.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.920
They used to be like that, but see, now with Final Fantasy XII, Final Fantasy VII, they're

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.120
releasing games on a bunch of different systems.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.960
Now, we may see something that's released on the 360 that's different than the PlayStation

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.880
3 version, since they're gonna make 14,000 different versions of Final Fantasy XIII.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.880
Why?

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.820
I don't know, because they haven't milked it enough yet.

01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:03.520
I think what they're trying to do is get the preemptive strike on the multiple-sequel thing

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.840
like they've been doing lately with Final Fantasy VII, although even though I think

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:14.560
Final Fantasy V is my favorite of the series, but Final Fantasy VI was, I think, their most

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:20.240
epic, but Final Fantasy VII is the fan favorite, I think that they're just trying to say, let's

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.040
make this the next Final Fantasy VII and beat it into the ground.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.280
Probably.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.540
It makes perfect sense for them, anyway.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.460
So next email, huh?

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:35.080
This one is from SakuraMaxx, I guess.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.000
By now I have fallen off for some random landmark in World of Warcraft, maybe like Thunder Bluff

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
and I am now dead.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.120
I have two requests.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.480
Play iFutureList in my honor, and then have Rob get drunk and play DDR.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.320
While he's playing, make a video and put it on YouTube.

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:56.560
I seriously am a dead Tauren and I will be served medium rare in a steakhouse in a matter

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.400
of days.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.920
SakuraMaxx in Deathicus Server, still youngest OLR listener, what are your Ravencrest characters

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:03.920
names?

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.400
If you want to find out the character names, go check out-

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.400
Get on forums.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.680
Yeah, go on the forums, cheat plug.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:18.480
Also as far as me drunk playing DDR on YouTube, not going to happen anytime soon.

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:24.040
I don't know, if someone happens to have some Goldschlager nearby a DDR mat, who knows,

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.440
maybe one day, but I'm not going to do it for the pure sake of making a stupid YouTube

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.440
vid.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.400
There's plenty of DDR drunk vids on YouTube of other fools, go check that out.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:37.480
As far as playing music on the show, we can't really do that because we can play little

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.200
clips and you hear a little clip of iFutureList in the outro, that's the song we use for the

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.200
outro.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.360
We can't really play the full songs without the artist's permission, copyright issues,

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.360
blah, blah, blah.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.360
Then we can't put it on iTunes for free and all that.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.200
Well next email, shall I?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.200
Sure.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.200
I have an OLR, it's me, Neki.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.200
Excuse me.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.200
Neki's on my Myspace now.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.840
I haven't been able to get around to emailing in a while due to my business, but I'd like

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.480
to say the shows have been great, especially last week's, and I think the match game rules.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.160
Congrats on finishing your massage stuff, Jamie.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.160
Oh, thank you.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.920
I'm actually going to be getting my transcripts next week and I will have my diploma by the

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.920
weekend.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920
Congrats.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.920
Rad.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.920
We will do match game again soon, but we don't want to beat it into the ground.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:19.920
Okay.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.600
Let me read the email.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.560
Orange Lounge match game coming soon to mobile phones.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.520
And also for all the people that find fault in your show about being so informal, they

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.120
should listen to the show when you weren't there, Jamie.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.120
What?

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.860
Haha, it was all Loki reading news and Rob telling bad jokes as he wasn't up on news

01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:40.860
that week.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:41.860
Isn't that every week?

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:43.240
He was just being lazy that week.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:48.480
Look, if you thought that week was bad, just wait for next week because here's the deal.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.200
I'm flying out to Burbank at eight o'clock in the morning, which is why I'm running out

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.240
of the room so much because I'm trying to get my packing done, like laundry and stuff,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.080
like because I'm literally driving over to get taken to the airport in the morning and

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.080
everything.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.960
So I'm going to be gone Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then out of some weird twist of fate,

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:11.120
I fly back here on Wednesday just so Thursday I can drive back down to LA with dark soccer

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.120
again.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.080
And you might be thinking, why didn't you just stay in LA, you dumb ass?

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.120
And truth be told, A, I don't want to pay for a hotel.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.120
B, I didn't want to make Jamie drive down by herself on her birthday, and then I found

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.280
out Chris was going, so I wouldn't have to anyway.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280
But it doesn't matter.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280
It is what it is.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.120
I'll fly back and forth, be the fun little traveler.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120
So it'll be good.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:31.600
But yeah, I'm not going to be here at all next week, so I will not be really following

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.920
gaming news next week.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.720
So it's going to be the low-key show.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.640
Well, to keep going, this is mostly just to me.

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.200
As you love pinball and Lego, here's a great match, okay?

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.200
There's apparently a pinball.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.200
Yeah, one that someone made.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.200
I think there's a logo.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.200
Oh yeah, the logo pinball.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200
The logo pinball.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200
The logo pinball.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.200
Yeah, we talked about that one.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.440
That's great.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:58.600
Maybe it isn't accurate, but as damn useful as it is, and then this is Xbox 360 Regional

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.080
Compatibility Guide.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:05.120
So these are games that work on either or both systems.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.120
That's interesting.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.740
I didn't even know that was possible.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:17.600
The website is at xbox-sky.com-xbox360-regional-compatibility-guide.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:23.360
And yeah, there's actually a few games on here that work on, are they talking about

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.360
all regions?

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:31.080
Or just compatible games, because they have that official list on Microsoft's site.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.880
These are all region.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880
Oh.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.440
Pretty interesting stuff.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.160
Maybe a few games are multi-region.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.800
Far Cry works on both.

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.080
F.E.A.R. works on all three.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.120
It even is going so far as listing the PAL ones as well.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120
That's pretty cool.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.120
Anyway.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.120
Thanks for the link.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.120
That was pretty fun.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.120
That's weird.

01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.840
Yeah, I'm looking at this list as well.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.840
That's kind of weird.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.600
I'm going to actually link the thing in the chat room, unless Rob, you want to do it for

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.600
me?

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.600
Sure, why not?

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.600
Okay.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600
R2-D2 is being made into a real projector.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:07.360
Okay, he has an HD, but it has some nifty little features.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.440
And this is something on Gizmodo, which I'm not going to link.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.120
It's a projector that looks like R2-D2, hooray.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.960
Moving forward, after Loki's raving about Earth Defense 2017, I started to look into

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:27.040
it, and the USNCSC version supposedly works with UK PAL systems, according to the website

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.040
I aforementioned.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.560
I wish Microsoft made 40 to 80 gigabyte hard drives for the 360 instead of just making

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.400
it 20 gigabyte, and they announced one 20 gigabyte.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:43.200
Maybe I'm just bitching, but I should get an XSATA and link a PC hard drive to it.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:50.040
My home site, dscommunity.co.uk, is currently being serviced, slash having, I love the phrase

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:54.520
being serviced, having maintenance, so this isn't going anywhere, but the new site will

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.120
be up, quote, soon.

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.120
Nice plug, by the way.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.400
Yeah, he's saying, yeah, I got my site in.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.960
Anyways, bye, Necky.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:04.040
I think that email was sent just to get a free plug in.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040
No.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.040
I like Necky.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.040
Cool.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.040
Last email.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.040
Dun, dun, dun.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.040
Hey, guys.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.400
Love the show, and while this question is simple and may have already been answered,

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.320
I feel obligated to ask, after being able to talk about your show to a wide variety

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.000
of people that I meet every day whenever I might currently be, whether it's at school,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.360
work, convention, or at a concert, simply how many people do you estimate listen to

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.360
your show?

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360
End of sentence.

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.360
Thank you very much.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360
Kurt Peters.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.360
Kurt's somebody who I'm not going to say the last name.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.720
Sorry, I was going to say real quick, it looks like you can actually, I'm not a huge fan

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:48.040
of, you know, soccer or football, but you can get Football Manager 2006 and 2007.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.960
Both will work on the U.S. Xbox 360s.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:52.960
That's kind of neat.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:53.960
Huh.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:54.960
Except it's in PAL.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.400
But I'm sure if your TV, you know, is an HD standard?

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.600
Yeah, HD's pretty standard, so.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:06.140
As far as the answer to the question, you know, I'm going to be honest, we don't track

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.280
it very well.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.840
We have a program that can see how many times a show was grabbed, but we've never really

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.320
been about the numbers, because honestly, during the first, you know, couple of years

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.320
of Orange and L'Andrea, for a long time, I'll say the very first show we did for 12 people,

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.680
13 people, and you couldn't download the show.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.920
And most of us were in the same room, ha ha.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920
Yeah, ha ha.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:32.600
So that was mostly it, but we did the show back then and continue to do the show now,

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.360
even now, even though, you know, we got bigger thanks to podcasting, just because, you know,

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.480
Dark Soccer, Loki and I need an excuse to hang out every week, and, you know, this is

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.480
fun.

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.920
I don't need an excuse to hang out with you, Rob.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.240
You know what I mean, though.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:47.040
You know, it is an excuse in the end.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.040
Heart, heart, heart.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.040
Making little hearts.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.040
So, I don't know.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.060
Do you need a good excuse to hang out with Loki?

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.820
So in the beginning, in the beginning, we had about 12, 15 people.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.680
I would, I'm going to lowball it.

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.320
I don't, I don't know.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.320
It's kind of weird.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:10.920
Like, you know, I don't know if we should say, it's kind of, it's just, it's not important.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:11.920
Is it really important?

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.920
I don't think it is.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:13.920
No.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:14.920
No, no.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:15.920
I'll say this.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:16.920
It's, it's, it's four digits.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.600
It's somewhere, it's somewhere between 1,000 and 9,999.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.520
We'll leave it there.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.520
On the lower end.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520
All right.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520
That's it for the emails.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520
All right.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520
Yay.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:35.040
Anyways, as we kind of alluded to before the whole mailbag, and we actually kind of mentioned

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.840
it last week a little bit.

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:42.840
Spring Update's going to add a lot of things to the Xbox 360, including instant messaging

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.040
via Windows Messenger.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:49.440
And that kind of ties in with the whole keyboard attachment for the controller.

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:55.760
But you're going to be able to message people while playing games, and also while watching

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.680
movies, and they're also going to allow you to add Windows Messenger friends to your list

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.920
as well, which is kind of nifty.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:11.960
And some other things are going to be added as well, including they've got support for

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:22.720
some different video codecs, like MPEG4, H.264, and Play for Sure, which is kind of neat.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:28.440
Yeah, but no XVID and DivX support yet, so.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.520
But yeah, there's a ton of things that they're adding to that, and you know, that's awesome.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.880
I like that they're adding stuff instead of, I don't know, removing functionality.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:42.320
Like back groups compatibility in PlayStation 3.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.040
Is anyone in here going to get used out of that whole MSN feature that you can message

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.400
people on MSN?

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.620
I know I won't.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.360
I don't want people to send me messages while I'm gaming.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:57.800
You know, the occasional, hi, let's play Texas Hold'em or whatever message is fine.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.440
But I don't want to sit there and chat with someone while I'm trying to play a game.

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:04.280
Usually that takes concentration, you know?

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:09.440
How about this, Rob, switchable aspect ratios while watching video playback.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.160
You can do letterbox, zoom, stretch, and native, since you've lost your time.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.320
I didn't lose the remote.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.480
Somebody lost the remote, but it wasn't me, because it happened while I was on vacation.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.080
But we won't go there.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:26.880
Let's see, what else?

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:29.280
Oh, this is kind of cool.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.440
The whole downloading stuff, where you can download in the background, you can also set

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:38.560
your 360 to automatically turn off after your downloads are complete, or to run in like

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:41.320
a low power mode.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.840
Like a PC.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:52.440
It says, a new option in auto downloads for Xbox Live Arcade games provides faster access

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.600
to the entire collection of free trial versions of Xbox Live Arcade games.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:02.480
That's kind of nifty.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:06.920
The Rob Dean chant is taunting me, because I always decline his Hold'em invites.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.360
I feel bad.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.640
This one's kind of cool.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:14.640
Updates to Xbox Live Arcade to allow owners to quickly see what Xbox Live Arcade games

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:19.680
their friends are playing and join them, as well as tell a friend capabilities where they

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.880
can boast about their achievement scores.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.680
Great, so I'm going to get spam messages.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.840
I just got five points in Boom Boom Rocket for playing a song.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:32.840
Hooray.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:36.600
That's going to be fun.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600
That's...

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.600
Yeah.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.960
God, the chat room is making me sound like such an ass.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.400
You're not an ass, Rob.

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.960
I mean, well, they're like, oh, Rob never comes to play Texas Hold'em with us.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:53.000
GAK120 says, Sky's too cool to play with us, Rob D. It's not that you guys play on Friday

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.360
and Saturday night.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.360
That's clubbing night.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.320
You don't go clubbing anymore.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.000
Once in a great while, I do.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.720
I want to go.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.280
Well, we can sometime.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.280
Okay.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.120
Well, how about this?

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:11.960
We'll go clubbing when I finally play Hold'em with Rob D. How's that sound?

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.960
I'm just teasing.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.960
We need to go back out to karaoke sometime.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.960
That'll be fun.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960
Yeah, we do.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.240
Anyhow, back to games.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.800
You know, I could bring my Guitar Hero controller to karaoke.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800
Wouldn't that be fun?

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.280
People would still laugh at you.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.280
I would, yeah.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.280
Talk about looking like an ass.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:30.800
Anyway, last week on the show, I rammed and raved and I was so pissed off because my guitar

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:31.800
was broken.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.720
Although, well, you know, it did work.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.720
It would play the game.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.880
I was just upset that I had one of those model numbers that was part of this whole recall.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.400
You could fix them, by the way.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.400
Yeah, but here's the thing.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.600
Now you don't have to.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.880
Apparently, Red Octane has patched the guitars via Xbox Live.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:50.720
They rolled out a patch last night about 4 a.m. that will resolve the situation where

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:53.080
input from the whammy bar was not always recognized.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.400
Basically, it comes down to a calibration issue.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.680
And guess what else it does?

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.680
It breaks consoles, supposedly.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.680
It freezes your game.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.680
I don't know.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.980
There's reports on the internet, something to sit and dig, like all these people's consoles

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:09.400
are getting bricked and don't know if that's just unfortunate coincidence or if the patch

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.400
did something.

01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:11.400
Uh-oh.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.400
It really is calibration.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.120
That's what it was.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:19.880
And I mean, I would have fixed mine except the dumbasses that built the fucking thing.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.360
They put hot glue in the screws.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.320
So I can't, I'd have to scrape the hot glue out of the screw in order to undo the whammy

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.720
bar to adjust it.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.520
Thank you very much.

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.840
You bastards.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.840
How dare they?

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:40.840
Well, here's something that we started asking why they dare, since a lot of people are not

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:45.200
too very fond of the first one, although I thought it was cool.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:51.320
There is a rumor that there will be a Perfect Dark Zero sequel in the works.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:23:03.240
In the May edition of the official Xbox Magazine, there was a rumor pointing that it was actually

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:08.760
in progress and that there will be book tie-ins to go along with it, but right now it's rumor

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.920
mill fodder.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:10.920
Book tie-ins?

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.920
Joy.

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.920
I'm sorry.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.160
Wait, what game's getting a sequel?

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.160
Perfect Dark Zero.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160
Dark.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:22.080
Sorry, I wasn't a fan of Perfect Dark Zero.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.280
I didn't like the fact that you can't jump.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.800
This show needs a sound board.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.920
Yeah, they need to take Crackdown and Perfect Dark Zero and merge them into a game where

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.240
we actually have normal jumps.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.640
I like the super jumps.

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.640
I like being able to fly.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640
I like jumping!

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.640
Yay, jumping!

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:50.680
This week, Capcom has had their Gamers' Day, although we weren't invited, and they announced

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.560
a bunch of different games and stuff, and a lot of stuff for Xbox Live Arcade and the

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:59.840
PlayStation Network, including some stuff that you're probably not too surprised about,

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:06.240
including Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, which is a fucking long-ass name and

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.240
stupid.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.240
Just when you thought they couldn't make a Street Fighter II game with a longer title.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.400
I mean, I think that's the joke.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:17.800
I think that's seriously a joke, like, hey, we need a longer Street Fighter II game name.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.960
Super Duper Turbo HD Remix to the max!

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.960
Extreme!

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.960
Lame.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:23.960
Okay, that's lame.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.100
Lame, lame, lame.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:32.000
But anyways, it is coming eventually to both PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.480
and yeah.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.840
Hooray.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:41.200
Another thing that's getting an even longer title, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.800
Now that's cool.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.800
It's cool, but it's still a ret-

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.800
For matching service?

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.280
Just call it Puzzle Fighter, god damn it.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.400
Don't need the Super Puzzle Fighter II Remix HD Super Duper.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.400
It's Capcom.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.800
Wasn't that in our match game a couple, like didn't we do a match game like just like three

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.000
weeks ago here on the show about like what games do we want, and Puzzle Fighter came

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
up?

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Yeah, probably.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.400
That's awesome, because I think I put it on the list.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:05.680
I do want Puzzle Fighter.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.680
That's awesome.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:07.680
I'll buy it.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:08.680
It's awesome.

01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:09.680
Hell yeah.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.680
I heard they're adding new modes and stuff too.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:15.280
That they're going to have like a Puyo Puyo style mode in it, and that's rad.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280
Well the better-

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.280
Wait a minute.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.800
The game was kind of like Puyo Puyo actually, think about it.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.680
There was also, what was the other game, Panel de Pawn, which I think-

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:23.680
Puzzle de Pawn.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:28.240
Oh, Puzzle de Pawn, which is, I think is Pokemon Puzzle League, if I remember right.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.240
Nope.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:30.240
It's basically that game.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:31.240
Is it?

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.240
Puzzle de Pawn is Bust the Move.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.240
What?

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:34.600
That's Puzzle Bobble.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600
No?

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600
Puzzle Bobble.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.120
Yeah, Panda's a eucalyptus.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:39.120
I believe her.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:41.320
Puzzle Bobble is Bust the Move.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.640
Well, I will look it up right now.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.640
I know my title.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.920
Puzzle de Pawn is exactly the same game.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.080
I'm sure somebody in chat is correct with us right now.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.080
I want to have a version of-

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.620
I mean, how many fucking games do you have to shoot bubbles and connect to-

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.620
I'll be damned.

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.620
He's right.

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.760
It's the puzzle bubble shooting game.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.840
No, but it was Panel de Pawn.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840
Is it Panel de Pawn?

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.400
It's Puzzle de Pawn.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.400
Who cares?

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.000
I used to play this game all the time when I was-

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.840
You know what game I would love to bring out a version of over here?

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:10.840
It's Puzzle and Desu.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:11.840
It's Panel de Pawn.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.720
It's got to be this game.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.800
That makes much more sense.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.040
It's Tetris Attack, Pokemon Puzzle League.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.440
That game makes more sense.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.240
That game makes more sense to have in there.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.240
All right.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.240
It's Panel de Pawn.

01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.240
My bad.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.600
I still want Puzzle and Desu.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:32.760
One last game they're going to be getting is Rocketman, Axis of Evil, and Talisman.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.960
It's basically this universe that they've created.

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:42.760
It's very similar, like Robotron crossed with, they were saying, Geometry Wars.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:45.560
They're comparing everything in Geometry Wars nowadays, but anyways, it's going to be a

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:47.440
top-down shooter game.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:53.000
Yeah, lots of characters to choose from and lots of shit you're going to be blowing up,

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.960
so awesome.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.800
Let's come in Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:05.480
Well, if Shane was here, he'd be very happy to hear that Phoenix Wright 3 was also confirmed

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.000
at Capcom Gamer's Day.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.720
It's called Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations, and of course, there's a little trailer that

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.880
goes with it that you can see on the internet.

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:14.480
Shane was watching it over and over this weekend.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:19.000
I saw a little glimpse of it, and I believe it goes back to one time.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.040
The story has to do with when Phoenix Wright was once sued and was in court, so whatever.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.480
There's a lot of Phoenix Wright fans out there that'll be very happy about this.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.760
I still have somehow missed the first game, so this is one of those series, like you know

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.920
how everybody has those lists of games I really should play someday now, but I just don't

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.940
have the time because I'm too busy clubbing?

01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:41.940
This is one of those games.

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:42.940
Okay, question for you.

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:43.940
What?

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:48.740
How long do you think before they get a Wii version where when you yell out, hold it,

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.120
you have to actually point the remote at the screen like you're pointing?

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.080
Dude, I hope so.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.240
Also, if you can't get enough attorney games, hey, wait for this.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:05.400
Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, is coming to the PlayStation 2 and PSP, so not the new

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.800
stuff, but the old console's feeling a little love there.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:15.840
Obviously, it's the Adult Swim cartoon there, and he defends famous cartoon characters,

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:19.720
so that should be interesting about how they're going to make that, because they'd have to

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:25.640
get other licenses to get like, you know, but I guess they just won't have any of the

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.680
other cartoon characters in the game.

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:30.720
They'll just have his own stuff, original stuff.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.720
I don't know.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.960
Either way, fans of Adult Swim will be very happy.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:39.160
And of course, other stuff that they were showing, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, and

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:45.160
Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, which I heard was pretty lame.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.720
Drunami being the Phoenix Wright fan, well, he hasn't been on the show in a while.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:49.720
What the hell gives Drunami?

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.000
Do you not love us anymore?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.240
Well, he plays Phoenix Wright.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:57.560
He says, young Phoenix Wright being on trial for murder with his teacher Mia Fay defending

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.560
him.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.560
There you go.

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.560
That's what Phoenix Wright's all about.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:04.760
Lots of folks are going to be happy with that.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.040
That's it for part A here of Orange Lawn Orange Radio.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.480
As you know, Orange Lawn Orange Radio is split into two parts.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.240
We tape here live on Sunday night, and we have to give ourselves a little break.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:14.340
We got to stretch, go to the bathroom, all that good stuff.

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:18.500
So while we take a break here, you guys listening to the podcast just have to wait a couple

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:20.200
days because we like to space it out.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:22.960
That way you get a lot of Orange Lawn's Radio all week long.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.560
And you'll get Orange Lawn's Radio part B. Those of you guys that are listening live,

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:27.560
stay tuned.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.400
We'll be right back after this.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.800
Orange Lawn's Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800
a week.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:47.760
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
