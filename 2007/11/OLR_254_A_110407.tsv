7000	12000	We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.
14000	19000	Tonight, November 4th, 2007, Nanhunt 2 proves a pot of controversy all its own.
19000	21000	Could Oblivion be headed online?
21000	25000	We discuss the ultimate dodgeball showdown of Pirates vs. Ninjas.
25000	28000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	46000	Pretty much like everything to do with video games, you know. That doesn't suck.
46000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51000	56000	How are you doing, Jamie? And your mic is off.
56000	59000	I turned it on. There we go, now we hear you.
59000	61000	I just turned my mic on again.
61000	65000	Maybe it was stuck. It was sticking. Maybe your mic got all sticky.
65000	67000	I didn't do it.
67000	70000	I want to eat my salad.
70000	74000	Well then you can eat your salad very soon. As soon as we do gaming weeks.
74000	77000	Forget that, I'm going to straighten my salad.
77000	84000	Fine. While she dives in, I'm going to introduce. Will you show Op11 your lovely salad from Quizmos before you dine in there?
84000	89000	We webcast her out on the webcam here at operator11.com. There's her lovely salad.
89000	93000	Doesn't make for great radio though, I apologize. So instead I will introduce the one and only Loki.
93000	94000	Hello.
94000	95000	How are you doing, Loki?
95000	99000	I'm doing okay because I figured out, I think, what I did wrong.
99000	101000	What do you think you did wrong?
101000	109000	Because I'm trying to update my firmware of my modchip. I installed it in my Wii and I think I had the toggle switch switched wrong.
109000	112000	It's off instead of on.
112000	117000	I would like to point out that DarkSakura is tossing her salad in the corner.
117000	118000	That's hot.
118000	122000	I'm going to actually toss DarkSakura's salad right here on Op11Cam. Look at that.
122000	123000	That reminds me, I got to get in the chair.
123000	125000	I will explain what I'm doing.
125000	132000	When you get the salads that have lids on them, you can actually get away with using less dressing if you pour however much you want on, close the lid and shake it up really well.
132000	133000	Oh yeah, that's what I always do.
133000	139000	So for anybody who is changing their lifestyle to eat healthier, there's a hint for you.
139000	141000	Tossing your salad can be good for you.
141000	145000	So you don't have to dip your salad like the books tell you to because that's retarded.
145000	146000	Alright, anyhow.
146000	148000	Books are retarded.
148000	158000	I'm sure we'll hear more about Loki's modship questionably legal activities a little later, but in the meantime I want to introduce a guest here in studio tonight.
158000	163000	Tonight we were going to be having Rice Princess and Extifer here, but they backed out at the last second.
163000	164000	Something about a flat tire.
164000	166000	Oh yeah, I'm supposed to believe there's a flat tire.
166000	167000	No, I'm kidding.
167000	169000	Sorry to hear that, but we do have Puppy is here tonight.
169000	170000	Yay.
170000	173000	They could have meant flat tire beer.
173000	174000	That's right.
174000	176000	They could have meant they had to go drink this beer.
176000	177000	I like that thought.
177000	178000	Very good.
178000	179000	Alright.
179000	180000	It's fat tire, not flat tire.
180000	182000	It depends on when you buy the beer.
182000	183000	Maybe they misheard it.
183000	184000	I don't know.
184000	185000	Maybe somebody made a typo.
185000	186000	I don't know.
186000	188000	Alright, because I got the message on MySpace.
188000	190000	When did MySpace replace email?
190000	191000	That's what I want to know.
191000	192000	Like, nobody sends me email anymore.
192000	193000	I just get messages on MySpace.
193000	195000	I have something better than email.
195000	196000	Oh my god.
196000	198000	Jamie whips out the iPhone.
198000	199000	Put it on camera.
199000	200000	Jamie bots herself an iPhone.
200000	202000	It doesn't have your number on it or anything, does it?
202000	203000	No.
203000	209000	Jamie bots herself an iPhone.
209000	212000	You joined the army of those that have these.
212000	214000	What made you decide to take the plunge?
214000	215000	My husband did.
215000	216000	Oh.
216000	218000	We grabbed them and said we want these.
218000	219000	Really?
219000	221000	And you were like, oh no, please stop, don't.
221000	224000	No, what happened is I was going to get a Blackberry.
224000	228000	And being that I do all this business and I need to have a planner on me and I need to
228000	232000	have something that I can keep track of all of my work and my dates and all that.
232000	234000	And I was going to get a Blackberry.
234000	236000	On top of that, I'm a texting fiend.
236000	241000	So, I figured it would be cost effective for me to buy a Blackberry instead of going out
241000	243000	and buying a PDA.
243000	248000	So, we look at them and the activation on them and everything ended up that it would
248000	255000	have been more reasonable or about equal when we did all the math that I could get an iPhone.
255000	259000	Of course, my husband doesn't want to be shown up by his wife.
259000	261000	So, he had to get one too.
261000	265000	And I think this is highly ironic that he's like, we need to watch money, we need to watch
265000	266000	money.
266000	268000	Let's break out the gold card and buy iPhones.
268000	270000	Still a wise purchase though.
270000	273000	You see, you guys say that women defy all logic.
273000	275000	Oh, hell no.
275000	276000	Hell no.
276000	280000	And let's of course introduce the always present other guests on our program, the Chat Room.
280000	284000	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to be when we tape live here on this Sunday evening,
284000	288000	which feels like a very late Sunday evening today, thanks to Daylight Savings Time.
288000	290000	It feels like later than it should.
290000	292000	And it got dark early and all that stuff.
292000	295000	Daylight Savings Time enabled me to stay up until 5 AM.
295000	297000	Yeah, I was up until 5 too.
297000	299000	But anyway, we'll get into that.
299000	300000	Were you playing with your iPhone all night?
300000	302000	Were you tossing your salad all night?
302000	304000	What were you doing?
304000	305000	She's chewing.
305000	306000	Playing Ragnarok.
306000	307000	Oh, addict.
307000	308000	Alright.
308000	309000	I could have guessed that.
309000	310000	I want to introduce the chat.
310000	311000	Let's see.
311000	312000	We're going to chat.
312000	313000	Let's see some comments here.
313000	316000	Xenocore, we'll start off tonight, says, Dark Sakura is tossing her own salad.
316000	317000	Simply amazing.
317000	318000	Is she a contortionist?
318000	320000	Dark Sakura is a woman of many talents.
320000	326000	Not only is she like a classic gaming fiend, but she is a salad connoisseur.
326000	330000	Except I don't think that's very good to put lunch meat in your salad.
330000	332000	This is a little bit weird.
332000	335000	WonderDogHerald also splurged a purchase this week.
335000	339000	I got my refurbed Zune from Woot.com this past week.
339000	340000	It's a baboo.
340000	342000	You don't hear a lot about Zunes.
342000	343000	I love Woot.com.
343000	344000	That's the best site ever.
344000	346000	Woot.com is pretty fucking woot.
346000	347000	Yeah, it makes me say woot.
347000	350000	I've never bought anything on there yet, but I always get there.
350000	352000	Whenever I see something I actually want, it's too late.
352000	353000	It was gone.
353000	356000	I almost bought steak knives on Woot.com.
356000	358000	Why do you need knives?
358000	361000	Because, okay, we have the same.
361000	362000	For eating steak.
362000	366000	Well, not that I eat a lot of steak, but whenever I chop vegetables, I like to use steak knives.
366000	369000	When she decides to chop and then toss her own salad.
369000	371000	You know what?
371000	372000	How old are we again?
372000	377000	The steak knives that we have are the same ones that Dan had when I moved in with him 10 years ago.
377000	378000	So, yeah.
378000	380000	So you need some knife upgrades.
380000	381000	I want a set of Gen 2 dinner knives.
381000	383000	You need to go to the weapon vendor.
383000	386000	Last time I bought knives, I chopped off the end of my finger.
386000	388000	Dude, I was there when that happened, I think.
388000	389000	No, you weren't.
389000	391000	No, but wasn't that when we lived together?
391000	392000	No.
392000	393000	I'm thinking of something else.
393000	394000	I must be thinking of a deep fryer incident.
394000	397000	No, you cut yourself on the knife using a steak knife to open boxes.
397000	398000	No, that was me.
398000	400000	I was using a steak knife to open boxes.
400000	402000	I was preparing.
402000	407000	Actually, it was about maybe a year ago.
407000	409000	It was around Halloween, I thought.
409000	410000	Maybe not.
410000	411000	I don't know.
411000	415000	Anyways, it was around Halloween about a year ago, actually.
415000	423000	It was a year from October 30th because I had bought a brand new knife and I was chopping
423000	429000	flat leaf parsley and not doing it properly and I severed the tip of my finger off.
429000	434000	And then I had to get a bandage put on there and the next day I came into work and someone
434000	437000	asked me if that's my costume and I'm like, you're an idiot.
437000	439000	Yes, finger mummy.
439000	441000	That's my costume.
441000	442000	Finger mummy.
442000	443000	I mean, come on.
443000	444000	I don't know.
444000	445000	Crazy bandage man.
445000	446000	Give me some candy.
446000	450000	It was funny, though, because I'm like, ow.
450000	452000	Or I'm like, I cut myself.
452000	453000	Are you okay?
453000	454000	I'm like, I don't think so.
454000	457000	They come over and there's blood going all over.
457000	458000	It was fun.
458000	461000	I just had a flashback to UHF.
461000	463000	You get to drink from the fire hose.
463000	468000	No, the guy doing the carpentry and sawing off his fingers.
468000	469000	Ow.
469000	473000	I just want to point out as well in our chat room, ShadowNextGen is bragging, I got the
473000	475000	$100 HD DVD player at Walmart.
475000	476000	Did you hear about that?
476000	480000	Walmart's selling HD DVD players for $100 to try and push the HD DVD format.
480000	484000	Sadly, I was in Walmart this week to buy a wireless GameCube controller.
484000	488000	Actually, just a GameCube controller, because I needed one right away, because that's when
488000	492000	I thought that I'd have my mod ship installed by Friday, and fortunately it took a little
492000	494000	longer than I thought.
494000	497000	But yeah, Walmart sucks.
497000	503000	Actually, I might put in the money for one of those if they're still selling them before
503000	505000	I go to Alabama.
505000	510000	But then my house would be the ultimate high definition entertainment home.
510000	515000	Well, if you have a 360, you can buy a $199 HD DVD player.
515000	519000	Or I could spend $100 for a dedicated HD DVD player.
519000	521000	You can actually use that on a PC, though.
521000	522000	Ooh.
522000	524000	I think if you plug it in the USB slot.
524000	526000	Well, I might be getting a Vio anyway.
526000	529000	We're either getting a Vio or an iMac if we buy something put together already.
529000	533000	All right, nerds, we've got to get the talk back to games, because we're already about
533000	534000	10 minutes from the show.
534000	535000	And then I can play all the Loom I want.
535000	536000	All right.
536000	537000	There we go.
537000	538000	Let's get into our gaming week.
538000	539000	Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week?
539000	540000	Ragnarok.
540000	541000	Again?
541000	542000	Yeah.
542000	545000	I'm working on getting more characters to level 90-ish.
545000	548000	I have one at 92 now.
548000	554000	And then I also looked at Guild Wars, but I didn't play, because my friend who I would
554000	556000	play Guild Wars with now works graveyard.
556000	557000	You just kind of looked at it.
557000	559000	You were like, hmm, it's still there.
559000	560000	Yeah.
560000	561000	It is nice.
561000	562000	It's there.
562000	563000	It's still.
563000	564000	No scratches or anything?
564000	566000	And Dan's been playing Phoenix Wright a lot of it.
566000	567000	Like, I always hear the music.
567000	568000	He's like, you're playing Phoenix Wright, aren't you?
568000	569000	Yeah.
569000	570000	OK.
570000	574560	And I am, though, going to be stealing the PSP, though, now that he's done with Rondo
574560	575560	of Blood.
575560	578800	And I'll be playing the hell out of that, because it's coming with me to Alabama.
578800	579800	I don't care.
579800	580800	Oh, my God.
580800	585000	I'm not going to be able to play Ragnarok when I'm in Alabama.
585000	586000	OMG.
586000	590320	See, by that powerful iPhone can't run Ragnarok.
590320	598360	Well, I can go on my LiveJournal on my, posting on LiveJournal on the iPhone, by the way,
598360	599360	is ass.
599360	602240	It's not what the iPhones are for.
602240	604600	iPhones are for phoning.
604600	608880	And it has an iPod on it, so I can listen to stuff.
608880	611240	You can listen to the Ragnarok soundtrack.
611240	616720	You know, when I actually installed the game, I didn't install the music in it.
616720	618080	Why did you do that?
618080	619560	I just didn't feel like it.
619560	624160	Because, you know, the music takes up a lot of space, and I'm playing on my Lappy.
624160	628760	Is your laptop that crunched for space?
628760	629760	Not really.
629760	634980	Not now that I have my portable hard drive, but, you know, I just don't want to bother
634980	635980	with it.
635980	640800	But, you know, I did actually play some of the games on the Homestar Runner site.
640800	641800	Does that count?
641800	642800	Sure.
642800	643800	Why not?
643800	644800	I was playing Trogdor.
644800	645800	Flash games are awesome.
645800	646800	You know what you could always do?
646800	650840	You could be larping when you're in Alabama, and you could pretend that you're in Ragnarok.
650840	654400	You know, you could be all, Hail!
654400	658000	I'm here to kick you in the face, and then I'll ban you!
658000	660000	Ban you forever!
660000	661000	What?
661000	666000	I used to larp in Alabama.
666000	669160	I played live-action vampire when I was, you know, freshly in college.
669160	671760	You're not supposed to admit to that.
671760	674240	Yeah, but I'm recovered.
674240	677240	You know, the first step of acceptance is...
677240	681280	Admitting you have a problem?
681280	682280	All right.
682280	683280	Oh, yeah.
683280	684720	I admitted I have a problem.
684720	686840	I moved.
686840	689560	Rama is reminding us of the best part of the larp.
689560	694240	This is the part where I run up to Jamie and go, heal, please!
694240	695240	No!
695240	696240	What?
696240	697240	Prawns once, please.
697240	699320	Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, this is why.
699320	703600	I don't play Priest, huh?
703600	707720	Except I'm playing a Crusader and people come up to my Crusader and go, heal, please.
707720	708720	Cuz Crusaders can heal.
708720	709720	Kick them in the face.
709720	710720	All right, let's move on.
710720	712920	Loki, how was your gaming week?
712920	715840	It was okay, actually.
715840	723000	Once again, I did not play any of my Ratchet and Clank Future, Tools of Destruction, untrunked
723000	730220	the game, but didn't touch it, so I don't know when I'm gonna play my Playstation 3.
730220	736520	When I played, what was it, God of War Chains of Olympus, a demo for that, it's actually
736520	737520	pretty cool.
737520	741360	I was very surprised, cuz I thought, you know, hey, with one analog stick, how the fuck are
741360	742400	they gonna do this?
742400	747600	But it worked really well, so looking forward to the full game when it comes out.
747600	751520	Definitely worth checking out the demo if you can, however, though, you have to be part
751520	756400	of that stupid Playstation Underground crap that I signed up for a long time ago and they
756400	761440	keep sending me stuff, so I keep playing it.
761440	768440	Then let's see, other than that, I played a little bit of Half-Life 2, some more Portal
768440	769440	for that.
769440	771440	That was fun.
771440	777240	Finally figured out what the weighted companion cube is, so now I get all the jokes and they're
777240	779520	not funny.
779520	781160	And let's see, what else?
781160	790600	Oh, I also played some Halo 3, actually, over, you know, Halloween, and we played over live,
790600	794600	cuz I don't really play much over live, but we went over to a friend's house and for Halloween,
794600	801300	we played Halo 3 while my wife and my friend's wife were playing Liar's Dice from Pirates
801300	802300	of the Caravan.
802300	809280	Halo 3 for Halloween, that infection playlist was fun, yeah, except we didn't really do
809280	810280	that.
810280	815160	No, wait, no, I'm sorry, I take that back, we didn't play over Halloween because the
815160	818920	Halloween party was last Saturday, so never mind, I already talked about that, so, no,
818920	823240	I did not play Halo 3, in fact, I did not hook up my 360 to live at all, but I will
823240	827440	assume you're playing Simpsons, the game, because that looks awesome.
827440	828840	Although it's getting mediocre reviews, you know.
828840	832680	I don't care, and you know what other game got mediocre reviews?
832680	838480	Earth Defense Force 2017, and I still have to go back and finish that damn game cuz motherfucking
838480	842400	can't beat the Inferno mode on that, I can't wait.
842400	846420	That's one of the things that I got the mod chip on my Wii for, which I did buy a mod
846420	853640	chip, by the way, it's CycloWiz version 2, I guess, one fucking bitch of a mod chip that
853640	858320	put on a Wii, and of course, I have no experience whatsoever in soldering, so you can imagine
858320	862560	how fun that must have been for me, I opened up and I'm like, holy shit, I'm not gonna,
862560	863800	this thing's gonna break.
863800	866200	Did you burn yourself at all?
866200	872040	I did not burn myself at all, but I was just so stressed out all week because I had, it
872040	876040	literally, cuz I took it to work to do it, cuz first off, I didn't want my wife really
876040	879920	knowing that I was doing it right away, because she would have said, you're gonna break that
879920	883080	thing, and you know, I didn't wanna have anything to do with that, plus if you've looked at
883080	887000	my computer room, there's no way I can solder in there, although I did last night.
887000	891240	Heaven forbid someone get between Mrs. Loki and her Excite truck.
891240	896640	Oh god, I was so afraid, I'm like, this thing better work when I'm done, cuz she's gonna
896640	900240	wanna play Excite truck, and holy shit, no, but, yeah.
900240	902680	That's honestly the first time I've ever heard you admit to fear.
902680	908260	No, it's just scary, but anyways, so I actually had it broken open, like, in our conference
908260	914680	room for like Thursday and Friday, just, you know, strewn about the giant table in there,
914680	919160	so I could work on it, and I did get it soldered finally, and it worked, and it powered on,
919160	923360	I put it all back together, I installed this toggle switch on it so you can update it,
923360	928480	got it home, finally went to try it this morning to update it, it wouldn't turn on.
928480	932140	I was like, shit, what the fuck happened now?
932140	936000	So I started to take it apart again, tried the switch again, and it worked, and I don't
936000	942080	know why, you know, something in there must have jiggled or whatever to ground it out
942080	947720	or something, so now it's working, but I don't have all the screws in the system, but that's
947720	951400	fine, I'm going to leave it alone, and it should be fine, but it looks extremely ghetto
951400	955120	now because there's, you know, a wire going up the side of it that's taped on there with
955120	959280	black electrical tape, and it just looks so ghetto, but you know what, I don't give a
959280	962760	shit because I'm going to be able to play Super Mario Galaxy a few weeks early.
962760	964800	And kids, don't try this at home.
964800	967760	But the other thing I'm actually, you know, to go back to my story...
967760	970840	I want to point out Loki's only doing this for research purposes only.
970840	975240	Well, that and the tryout import games, because I don't want to buy another Wii, besides I
975240	977400	wouldn't be able to find another Wii.
977400	981480	Anyways, so one of the things I did want to play when I first, when I get it all hooked
981480	987040	up is the first Simple Series game on the Wii, which is that kart racing game, so that
987040	988040	should be fun.
988040	990620	And I know later on they're going to add some more to the Simple Series, so that's kind
990620	994200	of what I'm looking forward to with this mod chip.
994200	999720	Other than that though, today though when I left, I think I figured out what I did wrong,
999720	1005120	but it does play Excite Trucks, so crisis averted, for now.
1005120	1006120	Until it breaks.
1006120	1009400	The other thing, and we'll get into this a little bit later, I played Manhood 2 on the
1009400	1015120	PSP, and once we get into the story a little bit later on I'll explain, you can hack the
1015120	1016120	hell out of that game.
1016120	1020240	And I'm sure it was a completely unaltered retail version of the game that you would
1020240	1025240	never think of reading about all these hack and crack stories and doing this to your precious
1025240	1026240	copy of the game.
1026240	1028680	And Rockstar never intended for that to happen.
1028680	1035940	Totally didn't have like a modded PSP or anything to do that, I'm totally serious.
1035940	1037080	Completely serial.
1037080	1038080	Alright.
1038080	1043840	My gaming week has been a lot of wow, I've been playing a lot of PVP, I'm almost exalted
1043840	1049840	in Alterac Valley, let's just put it that way, hey I'm trying to get my PVP here, what
1049840	1052800	can I say, I've been playing a lot of PVP.
1052800	1056720	Outside of that Guitar Hero 3, which I've played a lot more of, last week I didn't really
1056720	1059720	want to say a lot about it because I hadn't played much, but now I've played a lot of
1059720	1063960	the game, and it is a worthy sequel, I think is the best way I can sum it up.
1063960	1068200	I mean, you know, I want to jump up and go, it's the best game in the series, but...
1068200	1069200	It's not.
1069200	1074800	Yeah, it's kind of not, I mean, but it brings enough new stuff to the table, and I just
1074800	1078360	think so many people were afraid that Neversoft was going to screw it up, and I don't think
1078360	1079360	they did.
1079360	1080360	I mean, it's a pretty worthy success in my opinion.
1080360	1086240	They fell short in a few places in terms of note charts and difficulty and some of the
1086240	1087640	design aspects.
1087640	1089640	What are your bitches with the Guitar Hero 3?
1089640	1093760	Well, for one, the controllers you designed, way too sensitive for it.
1093760	1098880	Some of the design stuff on the notes and the note stream coming down, there's some
1098880	1103600	stuff you're used to in Guitar Hero 2 and 1, like when the notes jump up on the board
1103600	1107800	when you activate star power, it doesn't happen in 3, and it's hard to tell when you activate
1107800	1110440	it, just because the only thing that happens is it changes colors.
1110440	1111440	True.
1111440	1114120	And then some of the character designs, meh.
1114120	1118440	They took out Pandora, which made me sad, because she was cool.
1118440	1122800	And then some of the, I mean, it's part of the Heart Midori, I don't care what she says,
1122800	1123800	the Heart Midori song.
1123800	1127600	As soon as I saw that character when I opened up the game, I knew that was who we were going
1127600	1128600	to play.
1128600	1132360	Are you guys actually saying that you play Guitar Hero for the characters?
1132360	1136600	I mean, that's like playing Karaoke Revolution for the characters.
1136600	1139600	It's fun though.
1139600	1140680	Jamie says she played Rock Band.
1140680	1143360	Let me get to that in a minute, because I had a Rock Band experience too.
1143360	1145140	Let's see, so I Heart Midori.
1145140	1146140	The songs are fun.
1146140	1149780	I beat the game on medium, because I'm not that great at Guitar Hero, but I'm working
1149780	1152200	my way through on hard now, and then I'll work up to expert.
1152200	1155080	But here's what Guitar Hero 3 has that the other games didn't have.
1155080	1158040	Live, online, competitive play, which is actually a lot of fun.
1158040	1161840	I played with one of my friends, and we were playing some co-op mode, and you know, I couldn't
1161840	1166080	really play co-op mode in Guitar Hero 2, because nobody ever really came over with their guitar.
1166080	1168680	So it's kind of a, it's a really nice feature.
1168680	1173120	I haven't done it on live yet, I've just been practicing on hard mode, just to kind of get
1173120	1176640	back into it, since I haven't played Guitar Hero in almost a year.
1176640	1180720	Dude in Guitar Hero 3 has raining blood, I mean.
1180720	1182640	Don't even get me started on that shit.
1182640	1186120	And Guitar Hero 3 has the most kickass cutscenes ever.
1186120	1187120	The cartoons are awesome.
1187120	1191920	So I really consider this game a worthy successor, and I'm curious to see where it goes in Guitar
1191920	1192920	Hero 4.
1192920	1197640	I think it shows that they can get away, they can milk a fourth game out of this franchise
1197640	1198640	somehow.
1198640	1199640	So I'm curious to see what they do.
1199640	1200640	Oh, just a fourth game?
1200640	1201640	Yeah, okay.
1201640	1202640	And then some.
1202640	1203640	So I have fun with that.
1203640	1206460	Oh, plus the whole internet thing, you know, it ties into the internet.
1206460	1210960	It's been a little clunky, because, like, my stats are not updating at all, and it took
1210960	1214040	me like four days just to get my stupid account linked, because they've been having a lot
1214040	1215040	of problems.
1215040	1219340	But it's hard for me to kind of hold that against the game, because I see that as something
1219340	1223680	really ambitious, where you think about, how many other games have that kind of functionality?
1223680	1227800	Halo 3, and that's all I can think of, you know?
1227800	1232400	All the games, because all your live accounts are tied into, you know, you can bring them
1232400	1234120	up on your PC and stuff like that.
1234120	1239920	But the Guitar Hero thing has the leaderboards, and you can make your own little clan online,
1239920	1243760	and have a message form, and I'll tell you more about the O.L. Army Guitar Hero Band
1243760	1246400	in a minute, and all that, and I think that's kind of cool.
1246400	1250480	Even if it's been kind of clunky these first couple weeks, I'm hoping that, you know, in
1250480	1254380	a couple weeks it will smooth out, and things will run very smoothly.
1254380	1257640	It's certainly ambitious, and, I don't know, I don't hold it against the game, because
1257640	1259600	I see that as a bonus, not a necessity.
1259600	1263420	And it's certainly something that Harmonix wouldn't have had the resources to do on their
1263420	1264420	own.
1264420	1265420	I guess that's true.
1265420	1269320	So, anyway, I recommend Guitar Hero 3 if you're a fan of music games, and you like the first
1269320	1272560	two games, which I'm sure most people by now have come in contact with one of the games
1272560	1273560	at some point.
1273560	1277000	Also, I have been playing randomly.
1277000	1282560	I went over, William's cousin had a birthday, and he has a Wii, and we went and played Big
1282560	1288260	Brain Academy on the Wii, which is like, I guess, the brain training game on the Wii.
1288260	1291820	It's fun, it's another, you know, mini game collection, the kind of game that's easily
1291820	1295640	accessible by anyone, but here's the thing, there's not enough mini games.
1295640	1300380	I mean, I like some of the party modes, I thought the competitive mode where you work
1300380	1305040	your way through the mini games as fast as you can against other people, you know, within
1305040	1309540	the same room was kind of fun, but there wasn't enough variety in the games.
1309540	1312120	It needed like twice as many mini games as it actually has.
1312120	1315580	There's nothing fun about competitive math.
1315580	1319360	Not really, especially, you know, there's that thing where you have to pop the balloons
1319360	1320680	from lowest to highest, right?
1320680	1325320	Well, in this one mode, in expert mode, it's fractions, and I about cried when I had to
1325320	1327980	do that, because I'm like, oh my god, I have to do long division in my head?
1327980	1328980	This is horrible.
1328980	1333360	So, they call it Big Brain Academy for a reason, I suppose.
1333360	1336720	Try Before You Buy Big Brain Academy, because it's very limited.
1336720	1339680	If you have young ones, though, I bet they'd get a kick out of it, it would be fun.
1339680	1340680	How about this?
1340680	1343360	Spend your $50 on something better.
1343360	1344360	I hate that that's a lot of money.
1344360	1345360	It's a brain training game.
1345360	1346360	That is a lot of money for this game.
1346360	1348000	A brain training game on the Wii.
1348000	1349680	You're an idiot if you bought it.
1349680	1351720	You know what I do to train my brain?
1351720	1353160	I read.
1353160	1354640	I study things.
1354640	1356120	You can.
1356120	1358880	I don't need a game to help my brain.
1358880	1359880	Rock Band.
1359880	1360880	Jamie, you wanted to talk about Rock Band real quick.
1360880	1361880	Okay.
1361880	1366720	Dan and I went to Best Buy, because we were going to pick up Spider-Man 3, which actually
1366720	1370320	we ended up getting a better deal at Target anyway, because Best Buy had a two-disc thing
1370320	1376880	and Target had a three-disc thing for like $2 less, but anyway, I digress.
1376880	1382320	But they had the demo for Rock Band sitting out and it was just, okay, the guitars were
1382320	1387160	both destroyed and of course Dan went right for them, but the drum set was pretty cool
1387160	1388640	and it was a lot of fun.
1388640	1392920	I made him play Weezer because I love Weezer, so it was really cool.
1392920	1396560	I probably went to the same Best Buy you did at one point this week, because I had to buy
1396560	1401400	the Twin Peaks Gold Box Edition, which they didn't have at Best Buy, I had to go somewhere
1401400	1406540	else to get it, but anyway, nevertheless, I did see the Rock Band set up, but some kids
1406540	1411280	were playing and kind of monopolizing it and I didn't really want to jump in there, so
1411280	1412480	I just kind of watched.
1412480	1414280	It certainly looks kind of slick.
1414280	1418780	I like the backgrounds and stuff, it looks like fun, so I'll be probably picking that
1418780	1419780	up when it comes out.
1419780	1426320	I really like the little drum, you know, where you could freestyle a little bit, you know,
1426320	1427320	where you could ad-lib.
1427320	1428320	I didn't see that part.
1428320	1429320	That's kind of cool.
1429320	1436060	Well, yeah, it'll bring it up to where all of the lines are lit up and you can pretty
1436060	1438720	much free play on those measures.
1438720	1442400	It was really cool.
1442400	1444760	Let's see, what else did I play this week?
1444760	1445760	I think that's about it.
1445760	1446880	I thought there was one other thing.
1446880	1451120	Oh, I helped William set up his new PSP and that was about it.
1451120	1453440	So there we go, our gaming weeks.
1453440	1458640	So let's move on then and we'll talk a little bit about housekeeping and I promised a little
1458640	1462620	bit ago I would talk about our Guitar Hero 3 band.
1462620	1467760	If you search for OLR in the tour groups on the Orange Mountains Radio website, it'll
1467760	1472400	take you right to our OLR band, which I'm happy to say is in the top 100 bands right
1472400	1473400	now.
1473400	1475520	Number 76 as of an hour and a half ago.
1475520	1476520	Rockin'.
1476520	1479000	Yeah, actually a lot of people, because I plugged it in our live journal community,
1479000	1482680	our MySpace, or maybe I'll put another MySpace bulletin up tonight, I try to put it everywhere
1482680	1485280	I could think of where people would see it and it seems to be working because we've gotten
1485280	1489400	a handful of people to join and it's already put us in the top 100, but I will not rest
1489400	1492520	until we're in the top 10, which will take a lot of work.
1492520	1494680	We're going to be not resting for a while.
1494680	1499120	And I want to congratulate Origami Pirate, who's on top of the leaderboard within the
1499120	1500600	tour right now.
1500600	1501840	By much.
1501840	1506380	But yeah, I want to say that with the stats updating as infrequently as they have been,
1506380	1507800	that might just be a fluke.
1507800	1510320	But from what I understand, I think that's Spike, who's been on the show before and he's
1510320	1513840	really good at Guitar Hero, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's dominating the
1513840	1514840	OLR leaderboard.
1514840	1518120	Well, I'm number two, so I'll be moving up.
1518120	1519120	Oh, working.
1519120	1520760	Oh, them's fighting words.
1520760	1521760	Them's fighting words.
1521760	1522760	All right.
1522760	1523760	That's really all I wanted to say.
1523760	1524760	Obviously, I plugged in there.
1524760	1528960	We have a MySpace and all that other stuff, so you should find us and add us.
1528960	1532240	And of course, we always tape live on Sunday nights and that's in our chat room.
1532240	1535960	If you missed the live broadcast on Sunday nights, you can always listen to our rebroadcast
1535960	1540640	on All Games Radio Monday nights after All Games Interactive or Tuesday mornings at 9
1540640	1541640	a.m. Pacific.
1541640	1542640	All right.
1542640	1543640	Enough plugging.
1543640	1544640	News time.
1544640	1545640	Gaming news.
1545640	1546640	All right.
1546640	1549080	So of course, this week Manhunt 2 came out.
1549080	1551600	What did I say last week?
1551600	1556320	Yesterday we'd be talking about Manhunt 2 this week and that's what's going on.
1556320	1565760	And of course, sooner than later, we have a mini hot coffee on our hands and it's basically
1565760	1572760	the PSP version, the ISO of it out on the internet like any other game out there.
1572760	1577040	People looked into it and they hacked the distortion that would happen when you would
1577040	1579240	do your kills.
1579240	1585220	So now that's hacked out of the way, you now have an uncut version of the game, which is
1585220	1591000	funny because I actually kind of looked a little bit at this for research purposes and
1591000	1599020	all they have literally is just INI files, like stupid, fully documented INI files.
1599020	1605200	It even says this is where the distortion stuff is for your deaths and you can take
1605200	1606200	that out.
1606200	1611440	So I really went as far as not only just removing the distortion in there, but I made all the
1611440	1614740	guards blind and deaf, which was fun.
1614740	1616740	So there's a ton of things.
1616740	1622520	You can edit everything in the game, the weapon damage, you name it.
1622520	1623520	It's in there.
1623520	1628360	Although for some reason when I did make the guys blind and deaf, everything got really,
1628360	1629520	really bright.
1629520	1630520	So I don't know.
1630520	1632240	Somehow the lighting is attached to that.
1632240	1635560	Controversy aside, I want to ask first off, is the game good?
1635560	1637520	Why not?
1637520	1642680	It's really, plot-wise for the game, there's some sort of a storyline going along.
1642680	1649160	I've only played through the second level, actually the third level, and it's just death
1649160	1650160	after death.
1650160	1652000	It's just all about murdering people.
1652000	1654480	That really is a big surprise.
1654480	1657080	There's no big art thing in this.
1657080	1659560	It's just murdering people.
1659560	1661640	Granted, this is not art.
1661640	1662640	It is an art.
1662640	1665040	There's probably drugs in there somewhere too.
1665040	1666980	There is a storyline that goes along with it.
1666980	1670540	I'm sure when you play through the entire game you figure out why he's killing people,
1670540	1676720	but I mean, you can just shoot somebody and they're dead or know this game where you decide
1676720	1677920	I'm going to kill someone with a pen.
1677920	1679280	I'm going to kill someone with a syringe.
1679280	1683740	I'm going to kill someone with, you know, a bit of barbed wire and I'm going to saw
1683740	1685220	their balls off with the barbed wire.
1685220	1686740	I mean, just a little over the top.
1686740	1691120	I would think if I'm going to kill someone with barbed wire, sawing their balls off would
1691120	1692740	be the first thing that would come to my mind.
1692740	1694480	Yeah, I was a little excessive.
1694480	1699200	Uno says so it's a murder simulator I know it's not a murder simulator because
1699200	1702680	you're not really simulating murder you're just simulating a crazy guy that's
1702680	1706960	running away and happens to be killing people to get away if I was gonna kill
1706960	1712120	somebody with barbed wire I would do one of two things I would either run it
1712120	1716040	across their leg on the inside where the artery is or across their neck with a
1716040	1718880	carotid well that's what they kind of did they ran across her leg there's
1718880	1722600	three different kills you can do with each weapon one of which for I think for
1722600	1727920	barbed wire was the big one was running it through their leg the other one was
1727920	1731440	sawing off their head with it and then there was another one with like
1731440	1734440	strangling them with it I don't think you could really saw somebody's head
1734440	1738000	with barbed wire but you could sever the artery there's a video online that you
1738000	1743440	can actually view all the kills for this thing it I shut it off it was stupid like
1743440	1748040	I do you have it it was somewhere on the internet it was on some of the big game
1748040	1751360	blogs I watched part of it and I was like this is stupid you know I reacted
1751360	1756000	the same way to that video that I did to the movie the saw trilogy or quad quad
1756000	1758960	trilogy or whatever it is now you know I'll never watch them well soft for is
1758960	1761960	not art either I'm sorry number one movie at the box office last weekend
1761960	1767120	that's not art either I'm sorry okay they complain that oh when you know the
1767120	1771160	ESRB is being too hard on them and stuff like that no I don't think so I mean I
1771160	1775440	see them with the whole hot coffee thing I think rating that game adult only is
1775440	1780880	stupid I do agree with that but with manhunt 2 you just watch the
1780880	1784960	murder you know video that's out there and you're just like okay that's a
1784960	1790240	little over-the-top I mean yeah even for a game I mean come on it's you know it's
1790240	1794680	like over-the-top like hostel is I mean as they put it torture porn anyways
1794680	1798880	Pika Uno also wants to know um because you're talking about all these ways you
1798880	1804040	can kill people can you kill someone with a boat fire there is fire in this
1804040	1811120	game I know so I don't know maybe in the later stages anyways so anyways so the
1811120	1816560	ESRB of course made a statement about it they were saying that this is actually
1816560	1823000	it's different than the hot coffee thing because this is a hack versus something
1823000	1827400	that was unlocked on there which is bullshit anyways because the hot coffee
1827400	1831240	thing was a hack as well but apparently they're dumb and so well didn't this
1831240	1835320	time Rockstar disclosed everything that was in the game that was changeable see
1835320	1839440	yeah I mean they will they I mean they didn't really hide anything I mean
1839440	1842660	granted it all they did was remove the distortion I guess it's the same as
1842660	1845800	saying like the Sims where they have patches where you can remove the you
1845800	1852160	know the blur so that you can see sim body parts I mean it's stupid I
1852160	1856480	personally I do think that the game should have been released on you know
1856480	1860440	unmodified you know without the distortion on there because to be honest
1860440	1863520	it's not I mean I don't enjoy it with a source on there because you can't see
1863520	1866960	what the fuck is going on the whole of that if you go further it's kind of
1866960	1871840	censorship to me the hilarious part about all this is why did anybody even
1871840	1875400	run out and buy this game in the first place the controversy why was this game
1875400	1880520	hacked within 24 hours the controversy if they had like never said that there
1880520	1884520	were if if word had never come out that there was another version of this game
1884520	1890120	that had the blurs taken away I bet nobody would have ever thought gee let's
1890120	1892720	go in there and hack the disk or they certainly would have done it wouldn't
1892720	1896000	have done it in 20 years another thing that was opening that was a chat that
1896000	1899760	was issuing a challenge to the hacking okay unity I've to find the original
1899760	1902960	content in the game and they did it in there they would in the past I've
1902960	1906520	actually you know been curious and looked at different ISO's this has been
1906520	1913120	the easiest mom to modify ISO I have ever seen it is seriously fully
1913120	1918800	documented I mean there is it does not take a genius to fix this stuff you see
1918800	1921920	the part where it's you know for blurring it out you remove it done I
1921920	1927040	mean oh that's really tough I mean seriously it's stupid if they really
1927040	1931720	think they kept it easy because they had to fix it so fast to get the game out on
1931720	1936080	how they did have to fix the game and I understand that but no they could have
1936080	1940200	easily encrypted that stuff it could have been in a file it's not just a
1940200	1943680	plain text file it could have been encrypted it could have been something
1943680	1947400	that people couldn't find you know make it a little bit harder for them but I
1947400	1952000	don't know it's just it's really stupid Tiger Claw says keep in mind they only
1952000	1956920	hacked the PSP version an average person so far figure out how to do so far and
1956920	1959400	I'm going to tell you this much the PlayStation 2 version is gonna be hacked
1959400	1963640	before you know it because they put this way the INI files that were documented
1963640	1967680	in there it was for both PlayStation 2 and PSP so it's only a matter of time
1967680	1972960	this whole controversy is just waving a red cape at the hacking community oh lay
1972960	1977400	oh lay you know you've got about it if you've got a modded console this is
1977400	1982800	gonna be hacked pretty soon I mean no doubt about it because I'm looking at
1982800	1987280	just what they have in there that seriously the INI files that were in
1987280	1991120	there are documented for both PSP and PlayStation 2 I'm sure the Wii version
1991120	1996360	is also the same as well but those two were mentioned in that file so I don't
1996360	2001440	see why it wouldn't be the same it's just stupid and I think they did it on
2001440	2005360	purpose Tiger Claw says I think the only way you can hack the ps2 version if they
2005360	2011080	did it via the pro-action replay um no I think you can actually mod I mean
2011080	2014800	because there's people out there that make custom guitar hero games you know
2014800	2018840	for the PlayStation 2 if you have a modded console you can create custom ISO
2018840	2022080	for that stuff you know what this reminds me this whole thing reminds me
2022080	2026600	of remember when Nintendo made that controversial move to change the blood
2026600	2031960	in Mortal Kombat 2 to sweat and it was like suddenly it became this challenge
2031960	2037040	all over the like who can find the game genie code first that will change the
2037040	2041160	sweat to red to bring back the blood into Mortal Kombat 2 it became a contest
2041160	2045040	it was the red tape at the community going put me back the way I was supposed
2045040	2049200	to be because we all know this game was fixed you know but here's the thing
2049200	2055240	though I think even removing you know the distortion in or whatever it really
2055240	2059800	doesn't change anything in the game I mean yeah it's violent and stuff but to
2059800	2062840	be honest just like hostile hostile wasn't a good movie it was just a
2062840	2066080	violent movie it's just like this game it's not a good game just as a violent
2066080	2071000	game and it's just changing cutscenes and not actual gameplay I'm just kind of
2071000	2074000	pissed off at Rockstar for I don't know what the fuck they're doing they're
2074000	2078360	trying to like ruin everything by making games overly violent so that people come
2078360	2081840	down on them harder and they're like why do people keep coming after us it's
2081840	2086800	unfair well be maybe you should stop you know I don't know having people with
2086800	2090320	limbs being blown off and stuff like that in very graphic manners how about
2090320	2096080	that maybe that's a start all right well I'm sure most of our listeners have been
2096080	2098800	following on the internet and been reading about the manhunt controversy
2098800	2101240	I'm sure a lot of you have your own opinions if you'd like to send them in
2101240	2104560	you can always send us an email mailbag at orange laundry calm so moving on I
2104560	2107320	just want to say really quick there's rumors going around the target is
2107320	2110720	actually going to be pulling manhunt 2 from the stores because of this but I've
2110720	2113800	lead this has been going a little bit back and forth that it's a rumor no it's
2113800	2119240	not on it basically it started with a website PSP update that wrote this
2119240	2122800	report reports would come in the target is pulling manhunt 2 a member of the
2122800	2126840	evil avatar forums dr. finger hey evil avatars another show on all games woot
2126840	2131320	for them getting publicity said that he got news of an internal memo spreading
2131320	2134120	within the company which states that every branch will stop selling the game
2134120	2139200	and to refuse all future delivery of the title for the system however manhunt 2
2139200	2142280	is available apparently on targets website it's available online but not
2142280	2149920	available in stores so there you have it I think maybe I wonder if that's just a
2149920	2153680	demand thing though because I mean I when I think of big video game retailers
2153680	2157140	I don't always think a target target has a very limited selection of games they
2157140	2161280	carry what's kind of current and popular and honestly controversy aside I don't
2161280	2164360	think this game is gonna sell very well and I think they kind of know that they
2164360	2167640	would rather be stocking games that are gonna sell more I think it'll sell well
2167640	2176880	it's cheap it's like $39.99 for the we $29.99 for ps2 and PSP so all right
2176880	2183240	well there are other people mad about manhunt and for a different reason in
2183240	2188400	the manual for manhunt they didn't mention one of the major parties that
2188400	2194560	worked on the game being a Vienna yeah let's sort of forget you know people who
2194560	2201160	worked on the game here so they that's kind of messed up well yeah well their
2201160	2206240	studio is closed down but they still should have been as rockstar Vienna they
2206240	2210680	they still should have been credited for all the work that they did they said it
2210680	2216520	was over 50 people working for two years on the game so like it's almost like
2216520	2220640	rockstar Vienna got shut down and then all traces of it were erased in history
2220640	2225520	apparently they didn't get credited in this game but I'd be good for them
2225520	2229720	anyways but at the same time do you really want your name on this game I
2229720	2234360	think really I mean I agree completely that people should get credit for the
2234360	2238880	workday they do but I would be using an alias here's my thing I think they
2238880	2245460	should have made manhunt to just make it seriously I mean go all out put a PC
2245460	2250320	version out there and just fucking go nuts I mean do what you would do in man
2250320	2257760	hunt 2 and times 10 I mean seriously just crazy over-the-top that's what I'd
2257760	2263300	like to see darkside darkside says that's not cool you got to give people
2263300	2267560	credit for their work if I worked over two years on the game come on sky no I
2267560	2270540	agree people should get credit for the work they do but I'm just saying you
2270540	2275760	know if I worked on manhunt 2 I don't know like if I worked on orange box I'd
2275760	2279040	be all about one that piece that credit but you know manhunt 2 I don't know
2279040	2285280	about that all right anyways in other news and this is actually a little bit
2285280	2290320	of an opposite Sony actually has a brand new advertising campaign coming off the
2290320	2295300	PlayStation 3 that oh my god does actually not suck this campaign of
2295300	2300960	course a little bit different than the last year's campaign which is known as
2300960	2309680	the white room and according to Peter Dill of you know the PSN Network and
2309680	2315600	also the senior vice president of marketing apparently he's a last year we
2315600	2320480	launched a ps3 campaign that became known as the white room and received a
2320480	2324720	strong reaction to those ads for being provocative and demonstrating the ps3
2324720	2337480	power nope anyways man in our chat says the white room racists anyways let's see
2337480	2343320	with those technology technology messages now firmly embedded we wanted
2343320	2348280	to move beyond the power message with a more high energy entertaining driven
2348280	2355280	focus for the ps3 the games here the price point is now $3.99 and we want to
2355280	2362520	make the news loud and clear I don't get how he says they received a strong
2362520	2366440	reaction for being provocative no they didn't make any sense they didn't make
2366440	2369840	any sense I didn't understand why the PlayStation 3 is making a baby cry I
2369840	2374720	didn't understand why it was powerful why it was making you know it baseballs
2374720	2378760	explode or whatever it made no fucking sense and now you actually have an
2378760	2383080	advertising campaign or a series of commercials that actually show gameplay
2383080	2386600	get people excited about the games and stuff like that that's what you should
2386600	2391120	have done from the beginning instead of who I mean seriously all three consoles
2391120	2394840	are the same thing they did these really weird-ass commercials that made no sense
2394840	2399000	like with Xbox the whole jump in shit that makes no sense and they have one
2399000	2402120	going on right now which they have like a little kid like singing a song and
2402120	2407040	stuff and then they show Mass Effect Halo 3 and like oh god I remember Oh
2407040	2413480	Bioshock all M rated games you know and there's like yeah Xbox but anyways it's
2413480	2419840	just like so stupid but seriously I'm glad that they finally have a good
2419840	2424240	marketing campaign don't seriously next time you're launching a console you know
2424240	2429080	don't get all fucking crazy and hire this marketing team to come up with
2429080	2432920	these stupid ideas like you know baby crying so it makes no fucking sense
2432920	2436280	people get creeped out by that shit well I gotta buy your console well the new
2436280	2439320	commercial one of the new commercials I saw it earlier today it had like
2439320	2444880	tentacles and disembodied mouths coming out of the system it's cool that's cool
2444880	2449000	that's what people want disembodied mouths and tentacles and tentacles I
2449000	2452480	think if I were marketing the PlayStation 3 right now my marketing
2452480	2454960	campaign would go along the lines of something like this is there would be
2454960	2458000	like let's imagine it was a radio commercial for the PlayStation 3 here it
2458000	2467280	is please buy one I'll do anything they say I have MotorStorm and I played
2467280	2473320	blu-ray is please they say that they have games out there but I don't know
2473320	2481960	about that I have home in 2008 some final fantasy 13 sometime in the future
2481960	2487440	why won't you buy it they are showing Grinch for their log though even though
2487440	2493400	that's not available over here yet at all and to be fair that's not really
2493400	2499400	even a game yet or another PlayStation 3 commercial could be buy a PlayStation 3
2499400	2505160	and fold proteins all day long well they did show that it plays blu-ray and stuff
2505160	2509320	they have that and I here we go the PlayStation 3 is helping to cure cancer
2509320	2515720	if you don't buy a PlayStation 3 that means you support cancer that's what it
2515720	2522200	is I am all for cancer yay cancer anyhow that's a very tasteless a little side
2522200	2526400	tangent there let's talk about things that should probably be omitted from the
2526400	2530120	campaign because it caused one particular company stocks to drop a
2530120	2534000	little bit this week and that was the news that Metal Gear Solid 4 has gotten
2534000	2539280	another little little push got a little push back Oh surprise remember how
2539280	2542360	Metal Gear Solid 4 was gonna come out first quarter of 2008
2542360	2547440	well scratch that make it second quarter 2008 the day this news was announced by
2547440	2551960	the way Konami stocks went down a little bit because this was you know the game
2551960	2555280	that's supposed to be really giving a kick in the pants to the PlayStation 3
2555280	2561000	so one of the few exclusives they have left sort of there you have it Metal
2561000	2567260	Gear Solid 4 delayed until 2008 the two quarter to 2008 the official reason by
2567260	2571160	the way quote further improvements to the quality of the game and provide even
2571160	2576060	greater enjoyment for more customers worldwide don't get me wrong if this is
2576060	2579840	what they need to do to ensure the game is going to be an a plus plus and not
2579840	2584360	suck I'm all for it it just you know sucks for Sony right at least it's not
2584360	2587920	being you know powered by the Unreal 3 engine so we know it's not because of
2587920	2591740	that yeah so I don't care about the delay if it's gonna make the game
2591740	2595280	awesome as far as I'm aware there's no flying dragons in this game so I know
2595280	2602760	it's not anything like that well I think that you know with any game they need to
2602760	2605600	keep pushing things back if they don't have them done rather than released a
2605600	2612720	you know a buggy unfinished crappy product what game do we remember that
2612720	2616840	did that doesn't matter though it's like yes it's seriously gonna be like Twilight
2616840	2620440	Princess it doesn't matter it'll get 10 when it's released because people have a
2620440	2626360	fucking hard-on for that game hmm well there is actually something that might
2626360	2632000	make people happy it is still hanging out in rumor land but there there's
2632000	2639960	speculation that there's going to be a new PlayStation 2 in 2008 for $99 so it
2639960	2647800	actually is a reported by an NCV that it would be introduced in UK in the UK at
2647800	2656760	75 pounds or lower so I don't know because Sony hasn't you know no given any
2656760	2660880	official word on it I wouldn't be surprised if they can save you know 30
2660880	2664920	bucks or whatever by removing the chip to play PlayStation 1 games on that I
2664920	2669320	wouldn't be surprised whatsoever in fact actually it would make perfect sense if
2669320	2672800	they did that because you know to be honest no one really plays PlayStation
2672800	2677280	1 games anymore so if they remove the backwards compatibility for PlayStation
2677280	2683520	1 games in this ps2 I don't think anyone would care oh whatever and if you're
2683520	2688760	buying and you know Final Fantasy 7 for life I busted out jumping flash like
2688760	2692120	about a month ago if you wanna play jumping flash you can buy yourself a
2692120	2696280	PlayStation 3 and download that shit or buy a PSP I shouldn't have to pay for it
2696280	2700040	again why should I cuz I actually own the game well then you should have bought
2700040	2704680	a PlayStation 2 seven years ago I have a PlayStation 2 well then this doesn't
2704680	2709920	affect you I'm just saying any once more anybody that's still playing PlayStation
2709920	2714640	1 right now I mean there's still people who like to break out their classic
2714640	2718120	games good then I hope you have a PlayStation 1 but they're not gonna be
2718120	2721800	buying new PlayStation 1 games I mean whereas the PlayStation 3 not playing
2721800	2725460	PlayStation 2 games that's stupid because they're still putting out new
2725460	2731040	PlayStation 2 games but I think it's safe to remove the you know PlayStation
2731040	2735720	1 backwards compatibility in this if you know that's what they're going to do
2735720	2742840	dark text says Loki no don't give them ideas act deaf degrees the jumping flash
2742840	2748480	is awesome jumping flash is freaking rad you know that's what they need to do
2748480	2753080	that will completely revive the PlayStation 3 is a new jumping flash oh
2753080	2759160	yeah that'll be it gee only a new jumping flash should come out then I
2759160	2764360	would have something to play on this damn thing how about Bubsy 3d part 2 how
2764360	2771960	about not how about clay fighters I'm telling you how long ago do we say this
2771960	2776560	I miss playing Hilda six months ago when these you know console wars were heating
2776560	2782760	up and stuff we said the first console that gets laser cats the game will win
2782760	2786800	the next-gen Wars and you we have yet to see laser cats the game so it's anybody's
2786800	2790760	guess well there's technically I mean we're coming out on Dreamcast hostel
2790760	2795760	three's got that one gun that's a bat you know guys hand up a badger's ass so
2795760	2799520	that's kind of close I mean not really it's not a cat with a freaking laser on
2799520	2803640	its head we don't know that they don't have laser cats in that I mean next
2803640	2809600	story please another game that's been delayed a little bit and now is finally
2809600	2814320	officially coming out on a little PC at least unreal tournament 3 it's been
2814320	2821520	announced on PC for November 19th the PlayStation 3 versions coming soon
2821520	2829520	probably 2008 but it's soon I love that they're given the same old excuse my mom
2829520	2835960	gave when I asked mom when's dinner it'll be here when it's done that's
2835960	2840320	exactly what they're saying about unreal you will have it when it's done now sit
2840320	2845080	down and shut up and watch TV it really does suck though unreal tournament 3
2845080	2849160	isn't coming out this year I mean cuz I thought that would be the big game for
2849160	2854200	them to kind of get people to buy some consoles guess you'll be buying PCs
2854200	2860400	instead go PCs all I know is unreal tournament you know the older games were
2860400	2864520	fast so if you like your get you you feel like your shooters nauseatingly
2864520	2868560	fast and reels the place to go but I want to see all the mods for this that's
2868560	2873360	really what I'm interested in that will be kind of cool something that's kind of
2873360	2876880	cool for PlayStation 3 owners if you've especially if you've held out purchasing
2876880	2881400	Eternal Sonata on the Xbox 360 it has been confirmed that on the PlayStation
2881400	2885660	3 version of the game which was should be out next year at some point some new
2885660	2889240	characters will be added into the game they were in the story on the Xbox 360
2889240	2892760	version but they weren't playable and those are the characters Serenade and
2892760	2896800	Prince Crescendo cuz the big joke in Eternal Sonata is that every single damn
2896800	2899160	thing in the game is named after something in the music world which is
2899160	2902160	actually kind of cute by the way the PlayStation 3 version not only will have
2902160	2907200	the characters but it will have extra story sequences so of course the 360
2907200	2911800	fans are like you know especially me you know I bought the game on 360 and I
2911800	2916320	don't even own a PlayStation 3 as of yet I'm kind of going can it be download
2916320	2922600	content time please please can I have it but we'll see so Eternal Sonata on the
2922600	2928360	PlayStation 3 with extra crap next year yay I still should play that but I
2928360	2934680	haven't had time well this makes me relatively happy although it's a more of
2934680	2943040	a you know cuz yeah hi I'm tongue-tied this is really I think great news is
2943040	2948280	that the Final Fantasy 1 & 2 on PSP are coming out in the UK they're doing a pal
2948280	2953040	conversion so it'll be out in early 2008 and I think it was really really good
2953040	2958920	because it's the second one especially is such a good game but although the
2958920	2962880	third of those was my favorite the third and fifth were Mike my favorites but
2962880	2968560	anyway um we've had this for a while and they're really good the remakes have
2968560	2973360	just been very sharp the coloring and the graphics very sharp it's I actually
2973360	2976440	bought because you know I bought willing the PSP for his birthday and I bought
2976440	2983040	him a copy of Final Fantasy 1 so because he's a big fan of Final Fantasy so well
2983040	2987560	what I was saying is that you know they're basically taking the old you
2987560	2993000	know Nintendo versions and you know they're retooled with widescreen new
2993000	3000360	dungeons redrawn artwork just the works and I'm really glad that it's coming out
3000360	3004840	over there finally yeah it's gonna be really good and there was much
3004840	3010680	rejoicing overseas all right back at home it's time to travel around and in
3010680	3015580	the world and look at some early states yay really states anyways this week
3015580	3022080	marks the first of many very packed weeks with plenty of things coming out
3022080	3026800	this week though there are some stupid things coming out including Aqua teen
3026800	3031720	hunger for zombie ninja pro-am on PlayStation 2 if you can't get enough of
3031720	3038560	Aqua teen hunger for us there you go let's see here brats for real on the DS
3038560	3044840	awesome build a bear workshop as opposed to brats for fake well it's based most
3044840	3048280	of the things you see on the brats are probably fake actually build a bear
3048280	3053720	workshop where you can create your own it's a teddy bear sim to be honest this
3053720	3057600	game's 30 bucks you could probably buy a real teddy bear for a lot cheaper so
3057600	3060880	that's kind of stupid I think building the bear in the workshop and the actual
3060880	3065160	store cost less than that and probably I don't know that shit's expensive the
3065160	3069360	more bling you want to buy for your bear that shit gets expensive Call of Duty 4
3069360	3076000	modern warfare is coming out on both PC PlayStation 3 the Xbox 360 and strangely
3076000	3084840	enough the DS that's kind of weird Dora the Explorer Dora saves a mermaid not

3708800	3714520	you know you make your mask and you know have all these high-flying moves
3714520	3723840	and everything and the whole game is in Spanish that's what we need you know
3723840	3727360	what they need to make a video game out of speaking of Spanish television what
3727360	3731280	I tell you what you know what the fucking greatest show is on Telemundo
3731280	3739080	Sabado Higante Sabado Higante is like this big clusterfuck of a game show
3739080	3743040	meets a talk show meets it's like it's like all of everything that is and then
3743040	3748280	there's like a telenovelas in it too it's like all of what is great on TV
3748280	3751800	compressed into like one three-hour show have you ever seen the mad TV sketch
3751800	3757700	where it's like this Asian guide it's like it's like many show with two guys
3757700	3760560	or something like that but it's like different shows they change like the
3760560	3765840	theme of it it's like cooking show drama show you know you know what else game
3765840	3769160	that they need and this is inspired after watching Human Tetris last night
3769160	3775880	hmm they need Japanese TV show the game sorry act-def act-def is reminding me
3775880	3784520	that Sabado Higante is on Univision and not Telemundo sorry but have you ever
3784520	3789520	watched have you ever watched any Japanese game shows or some of the live
3789520	3795440	variety shows I saw like a freaking bizarre YouTube freaking bizarre they
3795440	3800440	need to do a game that's like that or like Takeshi's Castle the game that I
3800440	3804800	would buy that more news please because seriously now this show is getting into
3804800	3811040	let's see we've talked about Sabado Higante bra and panty matches and now
3811040	3815960	we're just talking about release dates so we need to get back into it news
3815960	3823680	anyways so this week as we mentioned you know of course you're starting to see
3823680	3828040	those rock band demo kits come to Best Buy as well some Best Buy is because
3828040	3831960	some retarded Best Buy employees are starting to sell the demo kits like the
3831960	3837000	actual game thinking hey we only got one of these let's put it out and sell it
3837000	3842680	and then some idiot buys it and then it ends up on eBay but then it's all over
3842680	3849200	the internet haha I gots the rock band first first ease so anyways cool I have
3849200	3852320	the biggest penis on the whole internet cuz I have rock band before you yes
3852320	3856800	apparently people are selling the demo kits and people are actually buying them
3856800	3865480	the demo kit actually the drums kit is missing the kick drum so oops the also
3865480	3870040	of course it's a demo version of the game so doesn't have all the songs and
3870040	3875000	what's really funny if you want it it's been relisted on eBay because
3875000	3879240	originally they pulled it down oh and they pull it down again but last I
3879240	3882640	checked it if the bidding was up to seven hundred and seventy dollars look
3882640	3885520	why would you pay six hundred dollars more for a game that's like gonna be out
3885520	3890040	in a few weeks anyways and it's not even the full game I'm like you're an idiot
3890040	3893920	sometimes I wonder if I'm even really in the same human race as all these other
3893920	3900360	people I mean it's but yeah you out of the gene pool what this particular case
3900360	3906120	it was the marina California Best Buy that they sold it to somebody for it
3906120	3909120	rang up as a hundred and eighty dollars I think that you're an idiot if you bought
3909120	3913840	it for a hundred eighty dollars and you deserve what you get but you know maybe
3913840	3917000	you do want to pick up one of these demo kits because apparently they're gonna be
3917000	3924600	hard to find come holiday according to EA president John around there John
3924600	3929720	anyways I'm not gonna try to pronounce his last name he's predicting that rock
3929720	3935000	band bundles may be tough to come by for a while we won't be able to put enough
3935000	3940840	inventory to meet the demand this fiscal or calendar year looks like a Ricky
3940840	3946360	tillio Ricky tillio I'm gonna go with that told investors adding that those
3946360	3950480	who don't buy at launch won't be getting one for Christmas unless you know someone
3950480	3956600	at one of our retailers what John forgot to mention to people is that that why do
3956600	3960160	you suppose that they're hard to find is it because the game is so immensely
3960160	3964240	pause you know popular that people are gonna be buying it like crazy it could
3964240	3968000	be or it could be they didn't make enough or it could be that they saw what
3968000	3971520	happened with the Wii last year and they're like we got to do that no you
3971520	3976720	see here here's a little funny thing about this EA has never made a music
3976720	3983800	game before and they've never made music game controllers before and so they're
3983800	3987960	having a little trouble making the music game controllers and guess what there's
3987960	3991480	a lot of shortages because of that and because you pre-ordered one doesn't
3991480	3995080	necessarily mean that you're gonna be getting one either think the Wii again
3995080	4001440	think guitar hero 3 yes same thing with that thanks a lot John if there's ever a
4001440	4007360	music game coming out there requires a guitar a drum a ukulele whatever the
4007360	4013080	fuck it will be our that's a tar yes the tar hero is redo here will be very
4013080	4018160	fucking hard to find because for some reason people have trouble making fake
4018160	4026880	guitars so if you have one pre-ordered awesome if you don't you're fucked you
4026880	4031400	better wait just take a broom and stick some old arcade buttons on it there you
4031400	4035720	go it's a guitar I will be getting one of these only because I have to lie
4035720	4041520	cheat and steal things well if you don't want to wait around or if you don't if
4041520	4044120	you aren't lucky enough to get your hands on a copy of rock band you could
4044120	4048240	always wait for harmonics is neck harmonics is next game I need to take
4048240	4053240	lessons in reading but the thing is harmonics will not be putting guitars
4053240	4059320	in their next game also be easy to find okay I mean obviously been there done
4059320	4063760	that guitar hero and now they have rock band and don't forget harmonics you know
4063760	4068720	started with frequency amplitude karaoke revolution these games do not have
4068720	4074400	guitars so their next game will not have guitars they will be revealing some
4074400	4077480	secrets about the game at next year's game developers conference I don't hop
4077480	4082880	hero this is what I know they're gonna rip off DER now awesome no I'm on it no
4082880	4087320	this is what they said quote beats would not be authored by tech savvy musicians
4087320	4091160	but would instead be algorithmically generated oh awesome
4091160	4095840	Dance Factory 2 there won't be a dedicated peripheral for the game
4095840	4102280	awesome amplitude million hey I would not mind a sequel to the frequency
4102280	4105640	amplitude you know I would be let's finish off that trilogy with a real
4105640	4109520	awesome game now that they have the heart you know they leave Lee has tracks
4109520	4115440	in that come on I'm all for it or they can just make freeze pop the game I'm
4115440	4120800	all for that too by the way let me take this opportunity to say I will jump in
4120800	4124480	here before Jamie reads her next story freeze pop is in Sacramento tonight in
4124480	4127920	NOL our headquarters they're playing a show downtown tonight I did not know I
4127920	4131960	swear to God they go on stage in like two hours shit I wouldn't have been here
4131960	4136520	if I had known that sucker and here we are doing the show you know you know
4136520	4140000	what I have is my alarm on my phone what's that science genius girl or
4140000	4146680	something no no we'll just sit here wait Jamie yeah you better except that I have
4146680	4153520	a news about guitar hero uh-huh that's actually really cool uh-huh so uh I'd
4153520	4156520	love to hear that cool news
4157600	4162840	I'm ready to um no it's like a radar I see the one let's talk more rock thank
4162840	4170680	you yeah that's my actual ringtone right now nice so anyway oh that was my Python
4170680	4178200	it was so worth the wait yeah anyway I love my iPhone I'm sorry so for anyone
4178200	4182880	who is interested in the downloadable content for guitar hero 3 there has been
4182880	4195960	a leak we which we hope is a real leak there is stuff listed as let me see if I
4195960	4200680	can this thing is kind of hard for me to read because it's all it's a picture
4200680	4208600	taken off of a television but there were boss battle tracks listed where you know
4208600	4211800	the ones you could pick and choose so it's pretty interesting that would be
4211800	4215080	great because you can't practice those in the game in practice mode and it's
4215080	4219160	pissing me off this is a lot of battles are hard there's the slash guitar battle
4219160	4224960	devil went down to Georgia putting holes and happiness the pretender this is a
4224960	4230120	call it's all on there so those are unlocked from the soundtrack if I
4230120	4234280	remember right like the putting holes in happiness yeah well and I almost bought
4234280	4239520	the the soundtrack just to you know see if you know how all that worked out but
4239520	4247440	of course I'm cheap and said it's okay sorry so but well basically that is
4247440	4251320	actually paid unlock content because that stuff is unlocked with the code so
4251320	4255200	the with just in the regards to like the putting holes in happiness I know it's
4255200	4260560	not really know that you get codes to down through it so I go get codes to
4260560	4265800	download the content off I stand corrected my bad next story please
4265800	4275080	anyways so overlord a game that I was playing quite a bit until Bioshock came
4275080	4280880	out he's getting some awesome download content actually three pieces of awesome
4280880	4286560	download content one of course is free enable and it actually allows you to
4286560	4292360	play a multiplayer split-screen co-op game which is kind of cool so to
4292360	4297880	overlords right around 50 minions each killing innocent people and then of
4297880	4303320	course two of the other packs will cost you some points no things have been
4303320	4307640	announced yet one will offer five new levels for the single-player campaign
4307640	4312800	the other will allow legendary a legendary difficulty and from right here
4312800	4318480	the five levels are in hell so that's kind of neat that's good that's smart of
4318480	4322480	developers to do because their game kind of did get you know stumped by you know
4322480	4326240	the Bioshock and the OMG halo 3 and all that so this is a good way to remind
4326240	4328800	people hey you might have forgotten about me but you should be looking at me
4328800	4333240	that's a good game that's fun I told you I'm I have a frickin copy of the game
4333240	4335720	and I still haven't had just play it cuz I've just been so distracted with
4335720	4338800	everything else don't point and make evil eyes at me don't give me evils
4338800	4344080	because I could be selling that game for don't give me evils I'm playing yes or
4344080	4346920	place you didn't regain because the only two consoles I don't have hacked yet
4346920	4351600	well last week on this program I believe Loki reported that IPTV was going to be
4351600	4356400	a part of the new fall update hey it was a theory okay theory is setting him up
4356400	4360980	that theory was nuked this week as Microsoft said oh shit we better make a
4360980	4365240	statement on this and Microsoft came out and said quote internet protocol
4365240	4369280	television IPTV features will only be available from the Xbox 360 through a
4369280	4373120	service provider who has deployed Xbox 360 with Microsoft media room services
4373120	4376720	this is an isolated incident where these features were inadvertently exposed
4376720	4380400	while the customers console was being serviced and is unrelated to the fall
4380400	4384880	update of course they didn't say how the fuck did that happen I mean seriously
4384880	4392120	where did that 360 go to get fixed it went to the future apparently but it is
4392120	4396080	I believe they did announce that it was supposed to be out before the end of
4396080	4404000	this year dates in the TARDIS where is the fall update in the fall no it's in
4404000	4409040	the news now fall check now I believe it's in the next few weeks next couple
4409040	4411800	weeks should be what I think last year is around the 12th or something like
4411800	4414680	that I wonder what kind of cool shiz we're gonna see in the update since
4414680	4420080	we're not seeing IPTV I know what stuff oh yeah I love stuff hey I got some
4420080	4429080	stuff yeah yeah got a salad no you ate it it has an anime an anime yes what's
4429080	4438400	that so for people who are fans of Blue Dragon we get an anime release of course
4438400	4442360	if Toriyama isn't you know involved in it you know there's gonna be an anime
4442360	4445440	involved which is why I wonder why we never got Chrono Trigger but that's
4445440	4451320	another story so um yeah Blue Dragon is going to have episodes coming to Xbox
4451320	4455460	Live for free November 15th through January 1st the episodes will all be
4455460	4462200	there to download and it's more of a promotional thing for the budget

4497080	4501200	of the download the guilty year to demo yes it still works still use it cuz they

4598520	4604280	quick as there's a quote Miyamoto says wait until you see the we five years
4604280	4608320	from now yay when they're in like finally support online foley and stuff
4608320	4613760	oh I only have to wait five years awesome pulling off the wrapping slowly
4613760	4625880	seriously anyways so other fun stuff pirates vs. ninjas dodgeball such an
4625880	4630680	awesome name for a game I guess it's been confirmed to be coming to Xbox live
4630680	4635880	arcade however they haven't really nailed down an exact time frame but
4635880	4641480	early 2008 as once expected and you will truly be able to see who is better
4641480	4650680	pirates or ninjas in the ancient art of dodgeball or zombies or zombies we're
4650680	4658400	ignoring a very important class of you know so of you know hinges no cowboys
4658400	4664640	fuck cowboys ain't got nothing they're never fans yes this is cowboys horse
4664640	4670960	riding losers we never saw movies about gay ninjas or gay pirates not counting
4670960	4684400	down that wasn't gay that was just you know Keith Richards anyways alrighty
4684400	4688880	well I'm looking forward to seeing the ultimate pirate vs. ninja showdown I mean
4688880	4692480	honestly I think this is a brilliant idea for a video game pirates vs.
4692480	4696720	ninjas somebody's finally doing it what do you lame
4696720	4701640	pirates vs. ninjas come on oh yeah that's awesome you know the instead of
4701640	4708680	having a really cool fighting and they go play dodgeball yeah frickin dodge
4708680	4713040	shut that thing up frickin of Jamie showing off her YouTube edge on her
4713040	4719560	phone um now I lost my train of thought god damn you oh I was gonna say pirates
4719560	4724120	vs. ninjas oh the dodgeball game that they had on the NES back in the day I
4724120	4726880	came was awesome well you can get it on a DS member the
4726880	4733360	remake that was awesome pirates and ninjas in that game how
4733360	4737960	awesome is that let's see Tiger Claw says oh I don't know having cowboys
4737960	4741760	would give the pirates and ninjas an unfair advantage cowboys use guns so do
4741760	4747960	pirates and they have fucking zords yeah they have ninjas started I think that I
4747960	4753680	think that honestly I think that the two enemy classes should be ninja and
4753680	4759760	cowboy and you have the pirate who's the hybrid on top of that they can swim if
4759760	4767560	they're good pirate lastly in this segment before we get to the classic
4767560	4771640	game of the week the engage I know you've all been excited about you know
4771640	4775160	you remember the engage of course was the taco phone and now the engage went
4775160	4779200	away because it was going to be a new service it's a basically standardized
4779200	4783600	platform for mobile services the engage gaming platform and I know you kids

4823480	4830520	says damn it you should be playing this game so Dark Sakura please reveal for us
4830520	4836360	like you said Dark Sakura is that the game Dark Sakura that'd be cool if there

4840840	4844880	and that it's not really I wouldn't say obscure but it didn't come out in the
4844880	4849200	US however we've had characters from this game show up in other games and I've
4849200	4854320	mentioned it before we have cyber BOTS full metal madness which is freaking
4854320	4859000	awesome very cool I'm getting some sound here from cyber BOTS tell the kids about
4859000	4864120	cyber BOTS while I get the sound here the cyber BOTS is a fighting game that
4864120	4870960	uses a mecha and you can choose a different classes of mecha and then each
4870960	4874360	of them have three different ones that are in that class that have different
4874360	4881560	types of weaponry so it's fairly customizable how you play it and it had
4881560	4887560	these little you know cinema cutscenes and a cool storyline but this game also
4887560	4895080	is what brought us the character Jin Soutome who was in Marvel vs. Capcom and
4895080	4901440	his robot Blodia so his attack was clearly from the game certain times of
4901440	4908160	the month my wife built Blodia okay whatever anyway and this game also
4908160	4919600	brought gave us devilot from a puzzle fighter and her she has the best robot
4919600	4929080	an entire game the super 8 which is a big octopus robot so this game also had
4929080	4935120	one of the best hidden characters was mecha goki which is basically goki was
4935120	4940680	a kuma over here from Street Fighter series they have a goki robot that has
4940680	4946920	all of those attacks everything was pretty awesome but also there was a you
4946920	4950320	know for anyone now who goes back and plays puzzle fighter in here to see
4950320	4955120	devilot's code you know never heard of it still to know cyber BOTS is Capcom's
4955120	4958360	number one game that's what it is I've actually got a special edition that came
4958360	4963880	with like a book in this big box and it was really cool on on Saturn and you can
4963880	4968560	actually still find the game for fairly reasonable but it's to me it's actually
4968560	4973000	I think one of Capcom's best games you know as far as how they're fighting is
4973000	4976680	going I think was a damn shame that you know we only got a very limited arcade
4976680	4983440	release over here it never got the home version yes all right well there you
4983440	4985920	have it boys and girls your classic game of the week
4985920	4995720	cyber BOTS I like any titles on again Saturn Saturn oh but it was arcade and
4995720	5001040	Saturn more Sega love from Dark Sakura well the Sega Saturn was like one of the
5001040	5004320	best systems there was a lot of overlooked games did fine sort of
5004320	5008080	related to Sega hmm there's many ITX computers that people are building
5008080	5014480	someone built one out of a Sega CD and a Genesis I was looking on the side it was
5014480	5021080	really cool minus collecting dust by the way all right well that's going to bring
