14024	19290	Tonight, November 4th, 2007, Manhunt 2 proves a pot of controversy all its own.
19611	21293	Could Oblivion be headed online?
21773	25378	We discuss the ultimate dodgeball showdown of pirates versus ninjas.
32196	36279	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36339	41944	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42004	44666	Pretty much like everything to do with video games, you know.
45066	45787	That doesn't suck.
46287	47408	My name is Rob Roberts.
47468	51231	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52752	53593	How are you doing, Jamie?
55314	56035	And your mic is off.
56555	58216	I see no... I turned it on.
58377	58657	There we go.
58717	59257	Now we hear you.
59618	60879	I just turned my mic on again.
60899	60939	Ah.
62165	62825	Maybe it was stuck.
63225	64146	It might have been.
64286	65446	Maybe your mic got all sticky.
65786	66386	I didn't do it.
68047	68987	A likely story.
69027	70347	I want to eat my salad.
70968	72588	Well, then you can eat your salad very soon.
72868	73949	As soon as we do Gaming Weeks.
74349	74629	Okay?
74649	75369	We'll get there very soon.
75389	75749	Forget that.
75769	76569	I'm going to straight my salad.
76709	76949	All right.
76989	77250	Fine.
78190	83891	While she dives in, I'm going to introduce... Will you show Op11 your lovely salad from Quiznos before you dine in there?
84152	88013	We webcast her on the webcam here at Operator11.com.
88033	88873	There's her lovely salad.
89841	90922	DarkSakura is tossing her salad in the corner.
118059	121761	I'm going to actually toss DarkSakura's salad right here on Off11Cam.
121801	122741	Look at that.
123581	125302	I will explain what I'm doing.
125762	129304	When you get the salads that have lids on them, you can actually get away with using less dressing.
129364	132225	If you pour however much you want on, close the lid and shake it up really well.
132385	133606	Oh yeah, that's what I always do.
134286	139448	For anybody who is changing their lifestyle to eat healthier, there's a hint for you.
139768	141209	Tossing your salad can be good for you.
141229	145211	So you don't have to dip your salad like the books tell you to because that's retarded.
145751	146291	Alright, anyhow.
147555	148636	Books are retarded.
176615	177316	I like that thought.
177456	177776	Very good.
178396	178616	All right.
178636	180938	It's fat tire, not flat tire.
180958	181918	Depends on when you buy the beer.
181938	182699	Maybe they misheard it.
182719	183059	I don't know.
183319	185040	Maybe somebody made a typo.
185080	185360	I don't know.
185700	185920	All right.
186060	187521	Because I got the message on MySpace.
188742	190363	When did MySpace replace email?
190403	191223	That's what I want to know.
191563	192644	Like, nobody sends me email anymore.
192664	193284	I just get messages on MySpace.
193304	194405	I have something better than email.
195485	196226	Oh, my God.
196246	198047	Jamie whips out the iPhone.
198487	198947	Put it on camera.
198967	200148	Jamie bots herself an iPhone.
200168	201509	It doesn't have your number on it or anything, does it?
201949	202049	No.
202089	202269	Okay.
203211	204891	Jamie bought yourself an iPhone.
205352	206832	The screen went off as soon as I held it up.
206872	207212	That's all right.
207572	208732	You bought yourself an iPhone.
209232	212113	You joined the army of those that have these.
212173	213413	What made you decide to take the plunge?
213974	214754	My husband did.
215374	216874	He grabbed them and said, we want these.
217434	217715	Really?
218535	220495	And you were like, oh, no, please stop.
220555	220855	Don't.
221215	222916	No, what happened is I was going to get a BlackBerry.
223956	232158	And being that, you know, I do all this business and I need to have a planner on me and I need to have, you know, something that I can keep track of all of my work and my dates and all that in.
232981	233842	I was going to get a BlackBerry.
234302	235783	On top of that, I'm a texting fiend.
236744	242047	So I figured it would be cost effective for me to buy a BlackBerry instead of going out and buying a PDA.
243108	255137	So we look at them and the activation on them and everything ended up that it would have been more reasonable or about equal when we did all the math that I could get an iPhone.
255157	257478	Of course, my husband doesn't want to be shown up by his wife.
259760	260741	So he had to get one too.
261710	267073	and I think this is highly ironic that he's like, we need to watch money, we need to watch money, let's break out the gold card and buy iPhones.
268855	270516	It's not a wise purchase, though.
271036	273377	You see, you guys say that women defy all logic.
273457	273998	Oh, hell no.
275732	276372	Hell no.
276572	280513	And let's, of course, introduce the always present other guest on our program, the chat room.
280573	288774	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to be when we tape live here on this Sunday evening, which feels like a very late Sunday evening today, thanks to Daylight Savings Time.
288814	291995	It feels like later than it should, and it got dark early and all that stuff.
292395	294636	Daylight Savings Time in Ilimu is up until 5 a.m.
295576	298756	Yeah, I was up until 5 too, but anyway, we'll get into that.
298836	300077	Were you playing with your iPhone all night?
300377	301517	Were you tossing your salad all night?
301977	302497	What were you doing?
309023	316190	DarkSakura is tossing her own salad.
316230	316970	Simply amazing.
317010	318011	Is she a contortionist?
318452	319893	DarkSakura is a woman of many talents.
319933	324357	Not only is she like a classic gaming fiend, but she is a salad connoisseur.
324377	329902	Except I don't think that's very good to put lunch meat in your salad.
330442	331263	It is a little bit weird.
332132	335053	Wonder Dog Harold also splurged a purchase this week.
335534	339075	I got my refurbed Zune from Woot.com this past week.
339195	339896	It's faboo.
340136	341336	You don't hear a lot about Zunes.
341797	342857	I love Woot.com.
342877	343758	That's the best site ever.
343858	346219	Woot.com is pretty fucking Woot.
346419	347459	Yeah, it makes me say Woot.
347519	350521	I've never bought anything on there yet, but I always get there.
350541	352361	Whenever I see something I actually want, it's too late.
352442	352802	It was gone.
352822	355183	I almost bought steak knives on Woot.com.
356423	357584	Why do you need knives?
358436	362099	Because, okay, we have the same... For eating steak.
362619	366502	Well, not that I eat a lot of steak, but whenever I chop vegetables, I like to use steak knives.
366663	368824	When she decides to chop and then toss her own salad.
369064	369485	You know what?
371286	372888	How old are we again?
372908	376791	The steak knives that we have are the same ones that Dan had when I moved in with him ten years ago.
377791	378192	So, yeah.
378532	379833	So you need some knife upgrades.
380193	381674	I want a set of Ginsu dinner knives.
381694	382895	You need to go to the weapon vendor.
383196	385938	Last time I bought knives, I chopped off the end of my finger.
386601	388363	Dude, I was there when that happened, I think.
388663	389104	No, you weren't.
389184	390885	No, but wasn't that when we lived together?
391286	391486	No.
391806	392587	I'm thinking of something else.
392627	394209	I must be thinking of a deep fryer incident.
394489	397892	No, you cut yourself on the knife using a steak knife to open boxes.
397912	398993	No, that was me.
399114	401976	I was using a steak knife to open boxes.
402517	406921	Actually, it was about maybe a year ago.
407262	408563	It was around Halloween, I thought.
409755	411036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
437762	439263	Yes, Finger Mummy!
439583	441044	That's my costume!
441184	442085	Finger Mummy!
442185	442785	I mean, come on.
443365	445847	But, um... I don't know.
445987	447748	Crazy bandage man, give me some candy!
448088	452351	It was funny though, because they're like, I'm like, ow, or I'm like, I cut myself, are you okay?
452391	453571	I'm like, I don't think so.
454412	456333	They come over and there's blood going all over.
456933	457274	It was fun.
458534	460055	I just had a flashback to UHF.
461336	462817	You get to drink from the fire hose.
463317	464578	No, the guy doing the...
465367	467587	The Carpentry and selling off his fingers.
469328	474949	I just want to point out as well in our chatroom, ShadowNextGen is bragging, I got the $100 HD DVD player at Walmart.
474969	475549	Did you hear about that?
475969	480630	Walmart's selling HD DVD players for $100 to try and push the HD DVD format.
480670	484290	Sadly, I was in Walmart this week to buy a wireless GameCube controller.
484510	493152	Actually, just a GameCube controller because I needed one right away because that's when I thought that I'd have my mod shipped all installed by Friday and fortunately it took a little longer than I thought.
494032	494152	So,
495441	496542	But yeah, Walmart sucks.
498123	503786	You know, actually, I might put in the money for one of those if they're still selling them before I go to Alabama.
504926	509669	But then my house would be the ultimate high-definition entertainment home.
510589	515672	Well, if you have a 360, you can buy a $199 HD DVD player.
515772	518474	Or I could spend $100 for a dedicated HD DVD player.
518914	520435	You can actually use that on a PC, though.
522023	522363	DarkSakura.com
541044	544785	Yeah, I'm working on getting more characters to level 90-ish.
545285	546806	I have one at 92 now.
547886	555749	And then I also looked at Guild Wars, but I didn't play because my friend who I would play Guild Wars with now works Graveyard.
556109	557090	You just kind of looked at it.
557150	559190	You were like, hmm, it's still there.
559290	560831	Yeah, it's there.
561371	562571	No scratches or anything.
562892	564212	And Dan's been playing Phoenix Wright.
565345	566166	A lot of it.
566206	567206	Like, I always hear the music.
567226	568327	It's like, you're playing it right, aren't you?
568467	568987	Yeah.
569348	569728	Okay.
570508	574991	And I am, though, going to be stealing the PSP, though, now that he's done with Rondo of Blood.
575352	578774	And I'll be playing the hell out of that because it's coming with me to Alabama.
578874	579294	I don't care.
580915	581416	Oh, my God.
581456	583457	I'm not going to be able to play Ragnarok when I'm in Alabama.
584898	585599	OMGZ.
586279	589741	Too bad that powerful iPhone can't run Ragnarok.
591162	594244	Well, I can, you know, go on my live journal.
596479	598880	Posting a live journal on the iPhone, by the way, is ass.
600700	601941	It's not what the iPhones are for.
602021	602981	iPhones are for phoning.
604502	608083	And it has an iPod on it, so I can listen to stuff.
608883	610343	You can listen to the Ragnarok soundtrack.
611184	615765	You know, when I actually installed the game, I didn't install the music in it.
617225	617866	Why did you do that?
618226	623287	I just didn't feel like it, because, you know, the music takes up a lot of space, and I'm playing on my lappy.
624127	624908	Is your laptop that...
626605	627325	Crunched for Space?
628646	629146	Not really.
629246	635328	Not now that I have my portable hard drive, but I just don't want to bother with it.
635768	640690	But I did actually play some of the games on the Homestar Runner site.
640750	641330	Does that count?
642171	642391	Sure.
642771	642911	Why not?
642931	643771	I was playing Trogdor.
643951	644892	Flash games are awesome.
645272	650694	You know what you could always do is you could do some LARPing when you're in Alabama, and you could pretend that you're in Ragnarok.
650774	653055	You could be all, Hail...
654432	655793	I'm here to kick you in the face.
656554	657414	And then I'll ban you.
658295	662018	Ban you forever.
662418	662658	What?
663239	665300	I used to LARP in Alabama.
666121	669243	I played live-action vampire when I was, you know, freshly in college.
669543	671084	You're not supposed to admit to that.
672285	674046	Yeah, but I'm recovered.
674066	679410	You know, the first step of acceptance is... Admitting you have a problem.
681292	681592	All right.
683518	684719	I admitted I have a problem.
684779	685219	I moved.
686981	689624	Ranma is reminding us of the best part of the LARP.
689644	693027	This is the part where I run up to Jamie and go, Heal, please!
693928	694588	No!
694608	696610	Warp front once, please.
696650	698152	Because, because, because, that's why.
699373	700714	I don't play a priest, ha.
703577	706660	Except I'm playing a crusader and people come up to my crusader and go, Heal, please.
707489	708590	Because Crusaders can heal.
708650	709291	Kick them in the face.
709751	710612	All right, let's move on.
710672	711733	Loki, how was your gaming week?
712914	713755	It was okay, actually.
715777	720922	Once again, I did not play any of my Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction.
721502	725166	Unshrunk the game, but didn't touch it.
725306	728329	So I don't know when I'm going to play my PlayStation 3.
730010	732333	Then I played... What was it?
732473	732553	Uh...
733237	734498	God of War, Chains of Olympus
761028	768996	Then, let's see, other than that, I played a little bit of Half-Life 2, some more Portal for that.
770438	770938	That was fun.
771298	774802	Finally figured out what the weighted companion cube is.
775182	778366	So now I get all the jokes and they're not funny.
779407	780848	And let's see, what else?
781449	784351	Oh, I also played some Halo 3, actually, over...
786243	787443	You know, Halloween.
787924	790445	And we played over live.
790465	801989	Because I don't really play much over live, but we went over to a friend's house and for Halloween we played Halo 3 while my wife and my friend's wife were playing Liar's Dice from Pirates of the Caravan.
802649	805911	Halo 3 for Halloween, that infection playlist was fun.
806651	807611	Yeah.
807671	809332	Except we didn't really do that.
810012	810492	Actually, no, wait.
811113	811573	I'm sorry.
811673	812213	I take that back.
812253	814034	We didn't play over Halloween because...
815154	816394	The Halloween Party was last Saturday.
816615	817675	So there, we already talked about that.
818815	819816	No, I did not play Halo 3.
819996	822317	In fact, I did not hook up my 360 live at all.
822957	826578	But I will assume you're playing Simpsons, the game, because that looks awesome.
827398	828739	Although it's getting mediocre reviews.
828999	829899	I don't care.
830379	832400	You know what other game got mediocre reviews?
832740	833961	Earth Defense Force 2017.
834701	840563	And I still have to go back and finish that damn game, because I motherfucking can't beat the Inferno mode on that.
841468	842529	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
864628	865848	Did you burn yourself at all?
866289	873951	I did not burn myself at all, but I was just so stressed out all week because I took it to work to do it.
874091	881973	First off, I didn't want my wife really knowing that I was doing it right away because she would have said, you're going to break that thing, and I didn't want to have anything to do with that.
881993	886875	Plus, if you've looked at my computer room, there's no way I can solder in there, although I did last night.
886895	890916	And heaven forbid someone get between Mrs. Loki and her excite truck.
891676	893918	Oh God, I was so afraid.
893958	897862	I'm like, this thing better work when I'm done because she's going to want to play Excite Truck.
898442	899043	Holy shit.
899063	902406	That's honestly the first time I've ever heard you admit to fear.
903066	904087	No, it's just scary.
904127	910713	But anyway, so I actually had it broken open in our conference room for Thursday and Friday.
911033	911193	Just...
912410	913891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
937196	938137	Thank you for watching!
952503	953524	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
978204	985987	One of the things I did want to play when I get it all hooked up is the first Simple Series game on the Wii, which is that kart racing game.
986927	987447	That should be fun.
987807	993949	I know later on they're going to add some more to the Simple Series, so that's kind of what I'm looking forward to with this mod chip.
994489	1003632	Other than that, today when I left, I think I figured out what I did wrong, but it does play Excite Truck, so crisis averted for now.
1005915	1008236	Oh, the other thing, and we'll get into this a little bit later.
1008256	1009837	I played Manhunt 2 on the PSP.
1011577	1014258	And once we get into the story a little bit later on, I'll explain.
1014438	1015979	You can hack the hell out of that game.
1015999	1025902	And I'm sure it was a completely unaltered retail version of the game that you would never think of reading about all these hack and crack stories and doing this to your precious copy of the game.
1026142	1028323	And Rockstar never intended for that to happen.
1028363	1032284	Totally didn't have a modded PSP or anything to do that.
1032704	1032804	I'm
1033922	1035903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1054531	1055574	which I've played a lot more of.
1055634	1063731	Last week I didn't really want to say a lot about it because I hadn't played much, but now I've played a lot of the game, and it is a worthy sequel, I think is the best way I can sum it up.
1065026	1066047	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1085602	1087302	and some of the design aspects.
1087522	1089503	What are your bitches with the Guitar Hero 3?
1089843	1093143	Well, for one, the controllers he designed, way too sensitive for it.
1093663	1110006	Some of the design stuff on the notes and the note stream coming down, there's some stuff you're used to in Guitar Hero 2 and 1 where when the notes jump up on the board when you activate star power, it doesn't happen in 3 and it's hard to tell when you activate it just because it's the only thing that happens is it changes colors.
1110166	1110406	True.
1110847	1113347	And then some of the character designs, meh.
1114065	1117126	They took out Pandora, which made me sad, because she was cool.
1118326	1121507	And then some of the... I mean, it's cool that they got Midori.
1121547	1122527	I don't care what she says.
1123707	1127848	As soon as I saw that character when I opened up the game, I knew that was who we were going to play.
1128589	1132550	Are you guys actually saying that you play Guitar Hero for the characters?
1132590	1134950	I mean, that's like playing Karaoke Revolution for the characters.
1136491	1137211	It's fun, though.
1139480	1140580	Jamie says she played rock band.
1140600	1143081	Let me get to that in a minute because I had a rock band experience too.
1143741	1144021	Let's see.
1144061	1144802	So I heart Midori.
1145082	1146022	The songs are fun.
1146102	1151844	I beat the game on medium because I'm not that great at Guitar Hero, but I'm working my way through on hard now, and then I'll work up to expert.
1152104	1154305	But here's what Guitar Hero 3 has that the other games didn't have.
1154565	1157986	Live, online, competitive play, which is actually a lot of fun.
1158026	1165588	I played with one of my friends, and we were playing some co-op mode, and I couldn't really play co-op mode in Guitar Hero 2 because nobody ever really came over with their guitar.
1166008	1168329	So it's a really nice feature.
1168729	1175556	I haven't done it on live yet, I've just been practicing on hard mode just to kind of get back into it since I haven't played Guitar Hero in almost a year.
1176477	1178158	Dude, and Guitar Hero 3 has Raining Blood.
1178519	1178739	I mean...
1180546	1182248	Don't even get me started on that shit.
1202408	1202988	So I have fun with that.
1225916	1226796	and that's all I can think of.
1227757	1234520	All the games because all your live accounts are tied into you can bring them up on your PC and stuff like that.
1234720	1253250	But the Guitar Hero thing has the leaderboards and you can make your own little clan online and have a message form and I'll tell you more about the OL Army Guitar Hero band in a minute and all that and I think that's kind of cool even if it's been kind of clunky these first couple weeks I'm hoping that in a couple weeks it will smooth out and things will run
1254300	1258141	It's certainly something that Harmonix wouldn't have had the resources to do on their own.
1279304	1281125	Cousin had a birthday, and he has a Wii.
1281425	1286829	And we went and played Big Brain Academy on the Wii, which is like, I guess, the brain training game on the Wii.
1288149	1288750	It's fun.
1288910	1293032	It's another mini-game collection, the kind of game that's easily accessible by anyone.
1293292	1294013	But here's the thing.
1294433	1295514	There's not enough mini-games.
1295734	1297675	I mean, I like some of the party modes.
1297755	1306320	I thought the competitive mode where you work your way through the mini-games as fast as you can against other people within the same room was kind of fun.
1306921	1307201	But
1307779	1308280	Thanks for watching!
1330118	1332239	They call it Big Brain Academy for a reason, I suppose.
1333240	1336662	Try before you buy Big Brain Academy because it's very limited.
1336702	1338963	If you have young ones, though, I bet they'd get a kick out of it.
1338983	1339403	How about this?
1339843	1342124	Spend your $50 on something better.
1343425	1345126	It's a brain training game.
1345146	1346127	That is a lot of money for this game.
1346147	1347547	A brain training game on the Wii.
1347887	1349128	You're an idiot if you bought it.
1349628	1350969	You know what I do to train my brain?
1351850	1352230	I read.
1353230	1353991	I study things.
1354611	1355091	You can.
1356232	1358333	I don't need a game to help my brain.
1358723	1359264	Rock Band.
1359284	1360806	Jamie, you wanted to talk about Rock Band real quick.
1360826	1360966	Okay.
1361166	1373641	Dan and I went to Best Buy because we were going to pick up Spider-Man 3, which actually we ended up getting a better deal at Target anyway because Best Buy had a two-disc thing and Target had a three-disc thing for like $2 less.
1373801	1376364	But anyway, I digress.
1376824	1378787	But they had the demo for Rock Band sitting out.
1379563	1403606	and it was just okay the guitars were both destroyed and of course Dan went right for them but the drum set was pretty cool and it was a lot of fun I made him play Weezer because I love Weezer so it was really cool I probably went to the same Best Buy you did at one point this week because I had to buy the Twin Peaks Gold Box Edition which they didn't have at Best Buy I had to go somewhere else to get it but anyway nevertheless
1404591	1406292	I really liked the little drum, you know, where you could, uh, uh,
1424611	1427172	Freestyle a little bit, you know, where you could ad lib.
1427432	1428273	I didn't see that part.
1428613	1429213	That's kind of cool.
1429233	1438678	Well, yeah, it'll bring it up to where all of the lines are lit up, and you can pretty much free play on those measures.
1438998	1442039	It was really cool.
1442259	1442760	Let's see.
1443420	1444540	What else did I play this week?
1444821	1445601	I think that's about it.
1445761	1446821	I thought there was one other thing.
1447022	1449963	Oh, I helped William set up his new PSP, and that was about it.
1451078	1452699	So there we go, our gaming weeks.
1453379	1456761	So let's move on then, and we'll talk a little bit about housekeeping.
1457622	1462504	And I promised a little bit ago I would talk about our Guitar Hero 3 band.
1462584	1471089	If you search for OLR in the tour groups on the Orange Islands Radio website, it'll take you right to our OLR band, which I'm happy to say is in the top 100.
1471869	1472590	Number 76 Rockin' Top 10
1491496	1493797	You're gonna be not resting for a while Well, I'm number two, so I'll be moving up
1522324	1523387	That's really all I wanted to say.
1523547	1524510	Obviously, I plugged in there.
1524550	1527698	We have a MySpace and all that other stuff, so you should find us and add us.
1528808	1531810	and of course we always tape live on Sunday nights and that's in our chat room.
1532210	1540714	If you miss the live broadcast on Sunday nights you can always listen to our rebroadcast on All Games Radio Monday nights after All Games Interactive or Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
1540794	1541254	Pacific.
1541775	1542855	Alright, enough plugging.
1543095	1543696	News time.
1543756	1544336	Gaming news.
1544956	1548798	Alright, so of course this week Manhunt 2 came out.
1548958	1550379	What did I say last week?
1551239	1553660	Everybody will be talking about Manhunt 2 this week.
1554701	1555961	And that's what's going on.
1556242	1556842	And of course...
1558730	1564354	Sooner than later, we have a mini hot coffee on our hands.
1564414	1571800	It's basically the PSP version, the ISO of it, out on the internet like any other game out there.
1572480	1578084	People looked into it and they hacked the distortion that would happen when you would do your kills.
1579205	1583048	So now that's hacked out of the way, you now have an uncut version of the game.
1584393	1593987	Um, which is funny, because I actually kind of looked a little bit at this for research purposes, and, um, all they have, it literally is just INI files.
1594067	1595209	Like, stupid...
1596246	1598908	Fully documented INI files.
1598988	1604531	It even says, you know, this is where the distortion stuff is for your deaths.
1604631	1605572	And you can take that out.
1605852	1614017	I actually went as far as not only just removing the distortion in there, but I made all the guards blind and deaf, which was fun.
1614678	1616679	So, I mean, there's a ton of things.
1616699	1618280	You can edit everything in the game.
1618340	1622863	I mean, the weapon damage, you name it, it's in there.
1623328	1628911	Although, for some reason, when it did make the guys blind and deaf, everything got really, really bright.
1629471	1630012	So, I don't know.
1630052	1632033	Somehow, the lighting's attached to that.
1632113	1635014	Controversy aside, I want to ask first off, is the game good?
1635275	1635435	No.
1636495	1636855	Why not?
1637176	1642659	It's... They're really, I mean, plot-wise for the game, I mean, there's, I guess, some sort of a storyline going along.
1642699	1644159	I've only played through the second level.
1645500	1646280	Actually, the third level.
1646961	1647101	And...
1648086	1649707	I mean, it's just death after death.
1649828	1651549	It's just all about murdering people.
1651869	1656173	That really is... There's no big art thing in this.
1656974	1659156	It's just murdering people.
1659716	1661438	I mean, granted, this is not art.
1662018	1662439	It is an art.
1662459	1664220	There's probably drugs in there somewhere, too.
1664240	1664681	It is an art.
1664721	1666823	I mean, there is a storyline that goes along with it.
1666883	1670166	I'm sure when you play through the entire game, you figure out why he's killing people.
1670626	1671267	But, I mean...
1672503	1685410	You can just shoot somebody and they're dead, or, no, this game, you decide, I'm gonna kill someone with a pen, I'm gonna kill someone with a syringe, I'm gonna kill someone with, you know, a bit of barbed wire, and I'm gonna saw their balls off with the barbed wire.
1685430	1686811	I mean, just a little over the top.
1687351	1692594	I would think if I'm gonna kill someone with barbed wire, sawing their balls off wouldn't be the first thing that would come to my mind.
1692614	1693734	Yeah, that's a little excessive.
1694275	1696436	Piker Uno says, so it's a murder simulator.
1697684	1700605	No, it's not a murder simulator because you're not really simulating murder.
1700766	1705788	You're just simulating a crazy guy that's running away and happens to be killing people to get away.
1706228	1710650	If I was going to kill somebody with barbed wire, I would do one of two things.
1711410	1716472	I would either run it across their leg on the inside where the artery is or across their neck where the carotid is.
1716492	1717573	Well, that's what they kind of did.
1717793	1718693	They ran it across their leg.
1718713	1720654	There's three different kills you can do with each weapon.
1721275	1726857	One of which, I think for barbed wire, the big one was running it through their leg
1727247	1727627	DarkSakura.com
1741614	1742395	I shut it off.
1742575	1743235	It was stupid.
1744156	1744796	Do you have it?
1745516	1746757	It was somewhere on the internet.
1746797	1748398	It was on some of the big game blogs.
1748478	1750039	I watched part of it and I was like, this is stupid.
1750599	1757123	You know, I reacted the same way to that video that I did to the movie, the Saw trilogy or quad trilogy or whatever it is now.
1757143	1758164	You know I'll never watch them.
1758244	1759685	Well, Saw 4 is not art either.
1759785	1760165	I'm sorry.
1760185	1761986	Number one movie at the box office last weekend.
1762026	1762847	That's not art either.
1762907	1763327	I'm sorry.
1763687	1764948	That's because people have no taste.
1765369	1769473	They complain that the ESRB is being too hard on them and stuff like that.
1769733	1770514	No, I don't think so.
1770714	1775919	I mean, I see them, with the whole hot coffee thing, I think rating that game adult only is stupid.
1776319	1777080	I do agree with that.
1777521	1781565	But with Manhunt 2, you just watch the murder scene
1782791	1784692	Piker Uno wants to know, can you kill someone with a boat fire?
1802967	1803768	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1825327	1834970	Which is bullshit anyways, because the hot coffee thing was a hack as well, but apparently they're dumb, and so... Well, didn't this time Rockstar disclosed everything that was in the game that was changeable?
1835170	1839252	See, yeah, I mean, they didn't really hide anything.
1839272	1841593	I mean, granted, all they did was remove the distortion.
1841653	1847755	I guess it's the same as saying, like, the Sims where they have patches where you can remove the blur so that you can see...
1848547	1849788	Sim body parts.
1850048	1851970	I mean, it's stupid.
1852630	1859716	Personally, I do think that the game should have been released unmodified without the distortion on there.
1859736	1864520	Because to be honest, I don't enjoy it with the distortion on there because you can't see what the fuck is going on.
1864880	1867442	On top of that, if you go further, it's kind of censorship.
1868078	1873282	To me, the hilarious part about all this is why did anybody even run out and buy this game in the first place?
1873603	1874403	The controversy.
1874744	1876665	Why was this game hacked within 24 hours?
1876945	1877706	The controversy.
1878086	1884612	If word had never come out that there was another version of this game...
1885192	1887513	That had the blurs taken away.
1887953	1891135	I bet nobody would have ever thought, gee, let's go in there and hack the disc.
1891355	1893616	Or they certainly wouldn't have done it in 24 hours.
1893656	1895157	Here's another thing, though.
1895197	1900519	That was issuing a challenge to the hacking community to find the original content in the game.
1900539	1901039	And they did it.
1901299	1901919	You knew they would.
1902220	1905601	In the past, I've actually been curious and looked at different ISOs.
1905961	1911043	This has been the easiest to modify ISO I have ever seen.
1911504	1914005	It is seriously fully documented.
1914085	1914345	I mean...
1916494	1918475	It does not take a genius to fix this stuff.
1918575	1921797	You see the part where for blurring it out, you remove it, done.
1922137	1924038	I mean, ooh, that's really tough.
1924479	1926260	I mean, seriously, it's stupid.
1926540	1931983	Do you think they kept it easy because they had to fix it so fast to get the game out on Halloween?
1932003	1937747	They did have to fix the game, and I understand that, but no, they could have easily encrypted that stuff.
1937927	1941289	It could have been a file that's not just a plain text file.
1941609	1942910	It could have been encrypted.
1942970	1944731	It could have been something that people couldn't find.
1945433	1949976	Make it a little bit harder for them, but I don't know, it's just really stupid.
1950136	1953599	TigerClaw says, keep in mind they only hacked the PSP version.
1953679	1956280	An average person will not be able to figure out how to do that.
1956300	1960363	So far, and I'm going to tell you this much, the PlayStation 2 version is going to be hacked before you know it.
1960423	1966467	Because, let me put it this way, the INI files that were documented in there, it was for both PlayStation 2 and PSP.
1966667	1967808	So it's only a matter of time.
1967908	1972471	This whole controversy is just waving a red cape at the hacking community right now.
1972751	1973152	Ole!
1973292	1974773	Ole!
1975814	1979737	If you've got a modded console, this is going to be hacked pretty soon.
1980257	1981879	I mean, no doubt about it.
1981899	1984321	Because I'm looking at just what they have in there.
1985021	1990126	Seriously, the INI files that were in there are documented for both PSP and PlayStation 2.
1990166	1992267	I'm sure the Wii version is also the same as well.
1992328	1995210	But those two were mentioned in that file.
1995310	1997912	So I don't see why it wouldn't be the same.
1997932	1999213	I don't know.
1999273	2000014	It's just stupid.
2000652	2001813	And I think they did it on purpose.
2001873	2006997	TigerClaw says, I think the only way you can hack the PS2 version if they did it via the Pro Action Replay.
2008878	2017524	Um, no, I think you can actually mod, I mean, because there's people out there that make custom Guitar Hero games, you know, for the PlayStation 2 if you have a modded console.
2017564	2019566	You can create custom ISOs for that stuff.
2019906	2020907	You know what this reminds me of?
2020927	2028392	This whole thing reminds me of, remember when Nintendo made that controversial move to change the blood in Mortal Kombat 2 to sweat?
2029318	2056813	and it was like suddenly it became this challenge all over like who can find the game genie code first that will change the sweat to red to bring back the blood into Mortal Kombat 2 it became a contest it was the red cape at the community going put me back the way I was supposed to be because we all know this game was fixed but here's the thing though I think even removing the distortion or whatever it really doesn't change anything in the game I mean
2057893	2061255	Yeah, it's violent and stuff, but to be honest, it's just like hostile.
2061295	2062456	Hostile wasn't a good movie.
2062476	2063457	It was just a violent movie.
2063517	2064518	It's just like this game.
2064558	2065318	It's not a good game.
2065398	2066279	It's just a violent game.
2067748	2070429	And it's just changing cutscenes and not actual gameplay.
2070449	2073791	I'm just kind of pissed off at Rockstar for, I don't know what the fuck they're doing.
2073811	2079094	They're trying to, like, ruin everything by making games overly violent so that people come down on them harder.
2079354	2081635	And they're like, why do people keep coming after us?
2081695	2082355	It's unfair.
2082415	2090059	Well, maybe you should stop, you know, I don't know, having people with limbs being blown off and stuff like that in very graphic manners.
2090099	2090519	How about that?
2090880	2091700	Maybe that's a start.
2093018	2094001	Manhunt Controversy
2100299	2101460	Woot for them getting publicity.
2128664	2129365	So, there you have it.
2148583	2154709	I wonder if that's just a demand thing, though, because when I think of big video game retailers, I don't always think of Target.
2154769	2156710	Target has a very limited selection of games.
2157051	2163977	They carry what's kind of current and popular, and honestly, controversy aside, I don't think this game is going to sell very well, and I think they kind of know that.
2164257	2166839	They would rather be stocking games that are going to sell more copies.
2166879	2167700	I think it will sell well.
2167820	2168400	It's cheap.
2168681	2170042	It's like $39.99 for the Wii, $29.99 for PS2 and PSP.
2170062	2170282	All right.
2177768	2206619	well there are other people mad about Manhunt and for a different reason um in the manual for Manhunt they didn't mention one of the major parties that worked on the game being uh Vienna yeah let's sort of forget you know people who worked on the game here so um they uh that's kind of messed up well yeah well their studio was closed down but they still should have been um as Rockstar Vienna they uh
2207799	2210262	Still should have been credited for all the work that they did.
2210282	2214325	They said it was over 50 people working for two years on the game.
2215527	2222754	So it's almost like Rockstar Vienna got shut down and then all traces of it were erased in history because apparently they didn't get credited in this game.
2222774	2225676	Which might be good for them anyways.
2225696	2226237	I would be pissed off too.
2227383	2229564	But at the same time, do you really want your name on this game?
2230164	2230885	I mean, really?
2231425	2237027	I mean, I agree completely that people should get credit for the work they do, but I would be using an alias.
2237367	2237988	Here's my thing.
2238528	2244771	I think they should have made Manhunt 2 just make it seriously, I mean, go all out.
2244911	2247432	Put a PC version out there and just fucking go nuts.
2247592	2252954	I mean, do what you would do in Manhunt 2 times ten.
2253034	2256296	I mean, seriously, just crazy over the top.
2257463	2261324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2283456	2293398	In other news, and this is actually a little bit of an opposite, Sony actually has a brand new advertising campaign coming out for the PlayStation 3 that, oh my god, does actually not suck.
2294539	2301940	This campaign, of course, a little bit different than the last year's campaign, which is known as the White Room.
2302601	2311903	And according to Peter Dill of the PSN Network and also the Senior Vice President of Marketing,
2314042	2325093	Apparently he says, uh, last year we launched a PS3 campaign that became known as The White Room, and we received a strong reaction to those ads for being provocative and demonstrating the PS3's power.
2327275	2328016	Uh, nope.
2329697	2332660	Anyways, um... Macman in our chat says, The White Room?
2332920	2333341	Racist.
2335270	2336551	Thanks for watching!
2360419	2364062	I don't get how he says they received a strong reaction for being provocative.
2364162	2365523	No, they didn't make any sense.
2366104	2366945	They didn't make any sense.
2367085	2369667	I didn't understand why the PlayStation 3 is making a baby cry.
2370007	2375772	I didn't understand why it was making baseballs explode or whatever.
2375872	2377273	It made no fucking sense.
2377533	2381897	And now you actually have an advertising campaign or a series of commercials saying,
2382077	2385718	They actually show gameplay, get people excited about the games and stuff like that.
2385798	2387659	That's what you should have done from the beginning.
2387999	2389340	Instead of, ooh.
2389660	2391900	I mean, seriously, all three consoles did the same thing.
2392201	2395042	They did these really weird-ass commercials that made no sense.
2395382	2398283	Like, with Xbox, the whole jump-in shit, that makes no sense.
2398463	2402304	And they have one going on right now, which they have, like, a little kid, like, singing a song and stuff.
2402504	2406906	And then they show Mass Effect, Halo 3, and, like, oh, God, I don't remember.
2407026	2408046	Oh, Bioshock.
2408166	2409527	All M-rated games, you know.
2409807	2410587	And there's, like, kids.
2410627	2410687	Yay!
2411428	2412029	Xbox!
2412530	2415194	But anyways, it's just like so stupid.
2416236	2420764	But seriously, I'm glad that they finally have a good marketing campaign.
2420884	2421145	Don't
2421886	2431893	Seriously, next time you're launching a console, don't get all fucking crazy and hire this marketing team to come up with these stupid ideas like baby crying and stuff.
2431933	2432894	It makes no fucking sense.
2432934	2434395	People get creeped out by that shit.
2434615	2435716	They're not going to buy your console.
2435816	2443021	Well, one of the new commercials I saw earlier today, it had tentacles and disembodied mouths coming out of the system.
2443201	2443601	It's cool.
2444482	2444922	That's cool.
2444942	2445603	That's what people want.
2445983	2446744	Disembodied mouths.
2446764	2447364	And tentacles.
2447384	2447924	And tentacles.
2448124	2448645	And tentacles.
2449699	2454504	I think if I were marketing the PlayStation 3 right now, my marketing campaign would go along the lines of something like this.
2454684	2457506	It would be like, let's imagine it was a radio commercial for the PlayStation 3.
2457787	2458127	Here it is.
2459088	2461450	Please buy one.
2461911	2463332	Please.
2463412	2465254	I'll do anything.
2465374	2468337	I have Motorstorm and I play Blu-rays.
2468437	2469918	Please.
2469958	2473842	They say that they have games out there, but I don't know about that.
2476115	2481960	I have home in 2008 some Final Fantasy XIII sometime in the future.
2482780	2484502	Why won't you buy it?
2484762	2490306	They are showing Gran Turismo Prologue though, even though that's not available over here yet at all.
2492368	2494109	And to be fair, that's not really even a game.
2495321	2502305	or another PlayStation 3 commercial could be buy a PlayStation 3 and fold proteins all day long.
2502525	2505787	Well, they did show that it plays Blu-ray and stuff.
2505987	2506267	Here we go.
2506528	2509429	The PlayStation 3 is helping to cure cancer.
2509849	2513291	If you don't buy a PlayStation 3, that means you support cancer.
2515352	2515893	That's what it is.
2515913	2517354	And I am all for cancer.
2517914	2518754	Yay, cancer.
2519495	2519755	Anyhow.
2520725	2522825	That's a very tasteless little side tangent there.
2522885	2526986	Let's talk about things that should probably be omitted from the campaign.
2527246	2531167	Because it caused one particular company's stocks to drop a little bit this week.
2531527	2535428	And that was the news that Metal Gear Solid 4 has gotten another little push.
2535908	2536808	Got a little push back.
2536868	2537728	Oh, surprise!
2538848	2541489	Remember how Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to come out first quarter of 2008?
2541569	2543749	Well, scratch that.
2543789	2544589	Make it second quarter 2008.
2544649	2547690	The day this news was announced, by the way...
2548655	2555080	Konami's stocks went down a little bit because this was the game that's supposed to be really giving a kick in the pants to the PlayStation 3.
2556301	2558022	One of the few exclusives they have left.
2558883	2559283	Sort of.
2560284	2560804	There you have it.
2560824	2565548	Metal Gear Solid 4 delayed until quarter two 2008.
2565928	2573314	The official reason, by the way, quote, further improvements to the quality of the game and provide even greater enjoyment for more customers worldwide.
2573774	2574555	Don't get me wrong.
2575393	2581214	If this is what they need to do to ensure the game is going to be an A++ and not suck, I'm all for it.
2581794	2583775	It just sucks for Sony right now.
2583795	2588196	Well, at least it's not being powered by the Unreal 3 engine, so we know it's not because of that.
2588216	2588756	Yeah.
2589176	2592317	So I don't care about the delay if it's going to make the game awesome.
2592457	2596377	As far as I'm aware, there's no flying dragons in this game, so I know it's not anything like that.
2598738	2598958	Well...
2600487	2609831	I think that with any game, they need to keep pushing things back if they don't have them done rather than release a buggy, unfinished, crappy product.
2611652	2613032	What game do we remember that did that?
2613052	2614032	It doesn't matter, though.
2615513	2617494	It's seriously going to be like Twilight Princess.
2617554	2618094	It doesn't matter.
2618174	2621716	It'll get 10 when it's released because people have a fucking hard-on for that game.
2623456	2627198	Well, there is actually something that might make people happy.
2627758	2630139	It is still hanging out in rumor land.
2630811	2636575	But there's speculation that there's going to be a new PlayStation 2 in 2008 for $99.
2638857	2649285	So it actually is reported by NCV that it would be introduced in the UK at 75 pounds or lower.
2650125	2654869	So I don't know because Sony hasn't, you know.
2656115	2657036	I don't think anyone would care
2681932	2682533	Oh, whatever.
2683013	2683533	Tough.
2683553	2685715	Final Fantasy VII for life.
2686395	2689958	I busted out Jumping Flash, like, about a month ago.
2689978	2693801	Hey, if you want to play Jumping Flash, you can buy yourself a PlayStation 3 and download that shit.
2694222	2695182	Or buy a PSP and download that shit.
2695202	2696523	But you shouldn't have to pay for it again.
2696804	2697484	Why should I?
2697504	2698965	Because I actually own the game.
2699325	2701547	Well, then you should have bought a PlayStation 2 seven years ago.
2701887	2702968	I have a PlayStation 2.
2703589	2705030	Well, then this doesn't affect you.
2706290	2707791	She wants more!
2708011	2714953	Anybody that's still playing PlayStation 1 right now, I mean... But I'm just saying that there's still people who like to break out their classic games.
2715333	2716914	Good, then I hope they have a PlayStation 1.
2717434	2719854	But they're not going to be buying new PlayStation 1 games.
2719914	2726517	I mean, whereas PlayStation 3 not playing PlayStation 2 games, that's stupid because they're still putting out new PlayStation 2 games.
2728637	2733759	But I think it's safe to remove the PlayStation 1 backwards compatibility in this if...
2734625	2735746	You know, that's what they're going to do.
2735766	2736466	I'm just theorizing.
2736486	2739989	DarkSakura says, Loki, no, don't give them ideas.
2741430	2743331	Actdeft agrees that Jumping Flash is awesome.
2744192	2745673	Jumping Flash is freaking rad.
2747157	2747458	You know what?
2747538	2748559	That's what they need to do.
2749099	2752823	That will completely revive the PlayStation 3 as a new jumping flash.
2753083	2754084	Oh yeah, that'll be it.
2754805	2761111	I know everyone's out there going, gee, if only a new jumping flash would come out, then I would have something to play on this damn thing.
2761271	2763974	How about Bubsy 3D Part 2?
2764254	2765055	How about not?
2766617	2767598	How about Clay Fighters?
2769901	2772244	I'm telling you, how long ago do we say this in a game?
2772264	2773285	I miss playing Helga.
2773545	2781594	Six months ago when these console wars were heating up and stuff, we said the first console that gets LaserCats the game...
2782333	2787056	will win the next-gen wars, and we have yet to see LaserCats the game, so it's anybody's guess.
2787096	2790298	Well, there's technically, I mean... It's coming out on Dreamcast!
2790378	2796701	Postal 3's got that one gun that's a bat, you know, a guy's hand up a badger's ass, so that's kind of close.
2797622	2799843	Not really, it's not a cat with a frickin' laser on its head.
2800423	2804505	We don't know that they don't have LaserCats in that, I mean... Next story, please.
2805026	2805406	Anyways...
2806252	2808414	Another game that's been delayed a little bit.
2808674	2812416	And now it's finally officially coming out on, well, PC at least.
2812817	2813937	Unreal Tournament 3.
2814058	2816819	It's been announced on PC for November 19th.
2817700	2820402	The PlayStation 3 version is coming soon.
2822243	2822684	Probably 2008.
2824185	2825365	But it's soon.
2827147	2832250	I love that they're giving the same old excuse my mom gave when I asked, Mom, when's dinner?
2832831	2834412	It'll be here when it's done.
2834432	2834512	Okay.
2835834	2837575	That's exactly what they're saying about Unreal.
2837975	2839756	You will have it when it's done.
2839856	2841597	Now sit down and shut up and watch TV.
2857691	2860894	All I know is Unreal Tournament, the older games were fast.
2861414	2866518	So if you like your shooters nauseatingly fast, Unreal's the place to go.
2866659	2868280	But I want to see all the mods for this.
2868360	2869841	That's really what I'm interested in.
2869981	2870822	That will be kind of cool.
2872643	2873784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2900220	2905402	By the way, the PlayStation 3 version not only will have the characters, but it will have extra story sequences.
2905922	2913504	So, of course, the 360 fans are like, you know, especially me, you know, I bought the game on 360 and I don't even own a PlayStation 3 as of yet.
2913964	2917205	I'm kind of going, can it be download content time, please?
2918146	2918886	Please, can I have it?
2919646	2920146	But we'll see.
2921587	2924548	So, Eternal Sonata on the PlayStation 3 with extra crap next year.
2925548	2926548	Uh, yay.
2927188	2929189	I still should play that, but I haven't had time.
2929841	2939783	Well, this makes me relatively happy, although it's more of a, you know, because, hi, I'm tongue-tied.
2940763	2947584	This is really, I think, great news is that the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on PSP are coming out in the UK.
2947604	2950785	They're doing a PAL conversion, so it'll be out in early 2008.
2951425	2957186	And I think that's really, really good because it's, the second one especially is such a good game.
2958620	2962783	Although the third and fifth were my favorites.
2962823	2966685	But anyway, we've had this for a while, and they're really good.
2967766	2970187	The remakes have just been... Very sharp.
2970267	2972288	The coloring and the graphics, very sharp.
2973189	2981314	I actually bought, because I bought William the PSP for his birthday, and I bought him a copy of Final Fantasy I. Because he's a big fan of Final Fantasy.
2981634	2981794	Yeah.
2982918	2997325	Well, what I was saying is that they're basically taking the old Nintendo versions and they're retooled with widescreen, new dungeons, redrawn artwork, just the works.
2997525	3001067	And I'm really glad that it's coming out over there finally.
3002587	3003448	It's going to be really good.
3004388	3007009	And there was much rejoicing overseas.
3007950	3008790	All right, back at home.
3008830	3012212	It's time to travel around the world and look at some release dates.
3012984	3013424	Yay!
3013464	3014144	Release date!
3014444	3021766	Anyways, this week marks the first of many very packed weeks with plenty of things coming out.
3022986	3029627	This week, though, there are some stupid things coming out, including Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am on PlayStation 2.
3030667	3033848	If you can't get enough of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, there you go.
3035008	3035708	Let's see here.
3035808	3038269	Bratz for real on the DS.
3039168	3039768	Awesome.
3040709	3041769	Build-A-Bear Workshop.
3041809	3044110	As opposed to Bratz for fake.
3044710	3047711	Most of the things you see on the Bratz are probably fake, actually.
3047851	3052232	Build-A-Bear Workshop, where you can create your own... It's a teddy bear sim.
3052892	3054053	To be honest, this game's $30.
3054313	3058514	You could probably buy a real teddy bear for a lot cheaper, so that's kind of stupid.
3058614	3062215	I think building a bear in the workshop and the actual store costs less than that.
3062455	3062975	Probably.
3063076	3063416	I don't know.
3063436	3064396	That shit's expensive.
3065060	3067741	The more bling you want to buy for your bear, that shit gets expensive.
3068421	3077765	Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare is coming out on both PC, PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and strangely enough, the DS.
3080006	3080546	That's kind of weird.
3081487	3083848	Dora the Explorer, Dora Saves a Mermaid.
3084708	3086929	Not that anyone's going to be buying that.
3088029	3089410	Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn.
3090097	3091737	Go Diego Go, Safari Adventure, Lego Star Wars The Complete
3116868	3118450	Saga, what the fuck they're calling that now?
3119071	3123376	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and DS.
3125239	3125859	Let's see here.
3127281	3129624	Zoo Vet Endangered Animals on PC.
3129644	3130685	Ooh, awesome.
3130765	3130986	What?

3145481	3148802	They're too busy working on more Dynasty Warriors games.

3226230	3226490	Really?
3226751	3227471	Yeah, seriously.
3227511	3228852	I thought that was a ways off.
3229453	3229773	Really?
3229993	3235597	If you want to enrich your life, you guess you could buy this game or a series of these games.
3235918	3240941	My French Coach, My Spanish Coach, My Word Coach, and also My Word Coach on the Wii.
3241242	3242583	Those are other games that were on the DS.
3243343	3247566	But the hacking community will be creating my sex coach out of this game.
3248047	3249288	How about my Lamaze coach?
3249308	3251269	Really, they are milking that franchise into the ground.
3265121	3266522	And that's actually what you do in the game.
3266862	3267602	You milk things.
3267642	3269523	That's a fantastically mixed metaphor.
3270123	3272724	Seen It on Xbox 360 is coming out.
3273444	3274164	That's kind of cool.
3274745	3279726	And the game I'm considering the game of the week, Silent Hill Origins on the PSP.
3280587	3281007	Really?
3281307	3282427	It's about fucking time.
3282527	3284008	Yeah, it's about fucking time.
3285008	3285568	But that's not it.
3286789	3292211	There's a game based off of the series The Office coming out on PC.

3302970	3304872	That's coming out on PC.
3305272	3309075	Viva Pinata is also coming out on PC this week.

3314239	3315780	Hannah... Wait, no, that already came out.
3315900	3317761	I was going to say Hannah Montana on Music Jam.
3317781	3318302	That's already out.
3318442	3318802	Again.
3319703	3319803	Um...
3321742	3326146	Let's see, I think that might be it here.
3327027	3329429	Let me get some comments from chat room while you're doing that.
3329449	3331550	Chat.orangeonestranger.com, live on this Sunday night.
3332191	3334993	Macman says, go Diego, go, straight to hell.
3336394	3338096	Forget Diego, go Pyramid Head, go.
3339262	3344146	Actdeft says Eureka's Castle greater than all Nick Jr.
3344186	3346748	shows in reference to... Eureka's Castle is great.
3346848	3347848	I like pinwheels.
3347868	3351011	Why isn't there a Eureka's Castle video game?
3351051	3355374	Or better yet... I want my You Can't Do That on Television game.
3358359	3362621	Where you have to, you know, make your way through the sausage factory and avoid the green slime and the pies.
3362641	3364662	I think it should be known that I'm so right there.
3364862	3365742	Exactly.
3365762	3369424	That's very Monty Python.
3369504	3372546	The whole show was like a spoof of Monty Python.
3372566	3373306	It was awesome.
3373326	3373726	Yeah.
3376027	3378408	Dude, you could play as Barf.
3378648	3379689	And you had Alanis.
3380429	3384411	And I like how that show was like borderline child cruelty, which is awesome.
3385877	3387818	Okay, and that's it for this week.
3387939	3389819	And a real quick tease for next week.
3390200	3392541	Are you smarter than a fifth grader on the DS?
3394722	3395502	Awesome.
3395683	3396903	I beg not to comment.
3396983	3399485	You can't do that in a video game, is what they could call it.
3399665	3400585	Oh my god, that'd be great.
3400625	3402406	Who owns the license to that stuff?
3402526	3403307	Someone in Canada.
3403567	3405688	Yeah, probably the Canadian Broadcasting Corp or something.
3406008	3410090	Dear Canada, me wanty, you can't do that in a video game.
3410290	3410590	Gimme.
3410610	3411151	Okay, thanks.
3412211	3413552	Your neighbor to the south.
3414567	3430059	Japan, going over to Japan and looking at Japanese releases Just Cause comes out on the Xbox 360 with a very Che Guevara looking cover Holy crap, that's fucking old Well, they're just now getting it in Japan, so there you go Major League Baseball, sometimes we have to wait for their games, right?
3430219	3432601	You know, like Blue Dragon took how long to come out here in the Final Fantasy games?
3432841	3433862	Sometimes they have to wait for ours
3434261	3434501	DarkSakura,
3461454	3462795	I'm moving on to basketball.
3462975	3466496	NBA Live 2008 on the PlayStation 3 out in Japan this week.
3466596	3469597	If you're a sports fan in Japan, you're a happy camper this week.
3469957	3472278	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2.
3472338	3473719	I really like that cover.
3473919	3475719	Making its way to Japan this week.
3476039	3477840	And look, complete with Japanese text.
3478180	3480201	That way you know it's authentic.
3480221	3483202	A game coming out on the PlayStation 2.
3484102	3487264	Kurino Okurimono is coming out.
3488104	3490705	All I can tell you is it's an adventure game from Takuyo.
3491377	3497000	Mario Party DS Castlevania, The Dracula X Chronicles, Minna no Golf, Hot Shots Golf, More Sports
3521737	3522917	Maybe you need to go to the potty?
3523137	3523398	No.
3523698	3525638	You want me to do your own release dates while you go release?
3525658	3526378	No, I'll do them.
3526538	3526838	Alright.
3527378	3529879	I was trying to speak Lolcat, I guess.
3530819	3531159	Failed.
3531379	3533019	Did you see the G4 Lolcat thing?
3533860	3534420	I don't care.
3534540	3535600	Oh, it was fantastic.
3535680	3537320	You said G4 and did you see it?
3537360	3538581	The answer's automatically no.
3538761	3540441	Yeah, but they make YouTube for a reason.
3540961	3543161	I love the YouTube channel on my iPhone, by the way.
3543181	3544042	Oh, I forgot to mention.
3544062	3545682	I can watch Cowbell Hero at work.
3546343	3549243	There's a couple games I forgot to mention that were coming out this week in the US.
3549444	3550004	Christ!
3550704	3551204	Sorry!
3551324	3552804	Fucking games are coming out this week!
3552824	3555405	Dragon Quest Monsters Joker on the DS.
3556045	3556985	That was coming out as well.
3557105	3559005	Empire Earth 3 on PC.
3559365	3560625	Alright, look, you're done.
3560665	3562646	If you didn't read them, they just got delayed to next week.
3562686	3563486	You can all thank Loki.
3564826	3565566	Yeah, Loki.
3566086	3566346	Okay.
3566786	3567567	My turn, please?
3568007	3568927	Can I have the turn now?
3568967	3569527	Yes, you may.
3570887	3575548	On the 8th, Sam & Max episode 201, Ice Station Santa.
3576286	3576706	Yay.
3577967	3580128	On 9th, Beowulf on Xbox 360.
3581049	3581329	You know what?
3581369	3584891	I remember when Beowulf was like a story and you could read it.
3585632	3587833	And now it's going to be a movie so you don't have to read it anymore.
3587853	3588233	The fuck?
3588453	3589314	Okay, whatever.
3589334	3590234	It's coming out on IMAX.
3590595	3591435	You know, it'll be big.
3591775	3592776	I'll go see it on IMAX.
3592816	3593837	I'll see anything on IMAX.
3595298	3599620	On the 9th, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare on a bunch of stuff.
3600941	3602402	9th, Dynasty Warriors Gundam.
3604379	3620107	Um, 9th also, EA Playground, Endless Ocean, Gears of War on PC, Jackass the Game, whatever, King of Clubs, whatever, Lair, okay, NASCAR 2008, Chase for the Cup, if you, you know, happen to be a European redneck, I don't know.
3621968	3628712	I like how Jamie is suddenly combining her release dates with her one phrase impressions of the game, whether she's played it or not.
3630279	3637463	You know, I have a particular funny thing about NASCAR is that they're opening up a big NASCAR arena outside my hometown.
3638364	3640805	And I get to go see it when I'm there.
3642206	3643667	While you're on your way to Chick-fil-A?
3643687	3645147	Dude, no way.
3645187	3646188	I'm going to Cracker Barrel.
3646688	3647749	I don't know what you're talking about.
3648349	3649630	Cracker Barrel and Waffle House.
3650010	3650470	Release dates?
3650690	3650931	Ninth.
3651351	3651811	Nick Toon.
3651951	3654232	Try not to get shot by Kid Rock while you're at Waffle House.
3654432	3654993	You know what?
3656997	3658998	Nicktoons, Attack of the Toybots on Wii.
3659158	3660198	That's actually a cool name.
3661039	3663580	Ninth, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008.
3663640	3673163	Because you can't have enough, you know, I guess bra and panty matches and, you know, steroidal men.
3673723	3675744	You know, you really can't, actually.
3675804	3676284	You can't.
3676444	3676824	You can't.
3676864	3677825	Chatroom, would you agree?
3677945	3680526	Is there such thing as too much bra and panty match?
3680626	3681746	I really don't think so.
3682398	3685939	There's too much bra and panty in those too much bra and panty matches.
3686319	3691440	But, you know, they could lose the bra and panty and I'd be fine.
3691881	3696702	You know what game they need to make if they're going to do wrestling games?
3696762	3700443	I like the WWE ones because I like the customizing mode.
3701543	3703824	I fully would just pick random people and just make them.
3704544	3705964	But they need a luchador game.
3707725	3708625	Nothing but luchadors.
3709725	3712206	You know, you make your mask and, you know,
3712659	3713059	Sabado Gigante
3735962	3740306	Sabato Higante is like this big clusterfuck of a game show meets a talk show.
3740346	3742747	It's like all of everything that exists.
3742848	3745249	And then there's like telenovelas in it too.
3745550	3750353	It's like all of what is great on TV compressed into like one three-hour show.
3750433	3753336	Have you ever seen the Mad TV sketch where it's like this Asian guy?
3753556	3759681	It's like mini-show with two guys or something like that, but it's like different shows.
3759721	3761042	They changed the theme of it.
3761182	3762143	It's like cooking show!
3763554	3764515	Drama Show!
3764835	3766455	You know what else game they need?
3766955	3769256	This is inspired after watching Human Tetris last night.
3769957	3772357	They need Japanese TV show the game.
3773358	3774218	Sorry, Actdeft.
3774478	3779700	Actdeft is reminding me that Sabado Higante is on Univision and not Telemundo.
3780300	3780680	Sorry.
3784302	3787363	Have you ever watched any Japanese game shows?
3788297	3790298	or just some of the live variety shows.
3790638	3793239	I saw like Utada Hikaru on YouTube.
3793759	3794840	Freaking bizarre.
3795400	3798762	They need to do a game that's like that or like Takeshi's Castle the game.
3800443	3801023	I would buy that.
3801143	3815990	More news, please, because seriously, now this show is getting into, let's see, we've talked about Sabado Higante, bra and panty matches, and now we're just talking about release dates, so we need to get back into news.
3816670	3817030	Anyways.
3817651	3826654	So, this week, as we mentioned, you know, of course, you're starting to see those Rock Band demo kits come to Best Buys.
3826694	3832855	Well, some Best Buys, because some retarded Best Buy employees are starting to sell the demo kits like the actual game.
3833275	3835136	Thinking, hey, we only got one of these.
3835636	3837096	Let's put it out and sell it.
3837677	3841498	And then some idiot buys it, and then it ends up on eBay.
3841998	3843538	And then it's all over the internet.
3843918	3846379	Haha, I gots the Rock Band first sale.
3847011	3847651	Firsties.
3849052	3852034	I have the biggest penis on the whole internet because I have Rock Band before you.
3852054	3856898	So yes, apparently people are selling the demo kits and people are actually buying them.
3857798	3862161	The demo kit, actually, the drums kit is missing the kick drum.
3865263	3868385	Also, of course, it's a demo version of the game so it doesn't have all the songs.
3870747	3872428	And what's really funny, if you want to
3873254	3876116	It's been relisted on eBay because originally they pulled it down.
3876377	3877898	Oh, and they pulled it down again.
3878498	3880820	But last I checked it, the bidding was up to $770.
3880980	3886665	I'm like, why would you pay $600 more for a game that's going to be out in a few weeks anyways?
3887305	3888426	And it's not even the full game.
3888486	3889367	I'm like, you're an idiot.
3890788	3894211	Sometimes I wonder if I'm even really in the same human race as all these other people.
3895452	3896453	I mean, but yeah.
3896513	3897654	You, out of the gene pool.
3899125	3903649	This particular case, it was the Marina California Best Buy that
3904210	3906571	They sold it to somebody for, it rang up as $180.
3906611	3911172	I think that you're an idiot if you bought it for $180 and you deserve what you get.
3912912	3919493	But, you know, maybe you do want to pick up one of these demo kits, because apparently they're going to be hard to find come holiday.
3920154	3927835	According to EA President John, I don't know, John, anyways, I'm not going to try to pronounce his last name.
3928796	3930616	He's predicting that Rock Band bundles me.
3931036	3933018	Being tough to come by for a while.
3933538	3938622	We won't be able to put enough inventory to meet the demand this fiscal or calendar year.
3939202	3951811	Looks like Ricky Tileo told investors, adding that those who don't buy at launch won't be getting one for Christmas unless you know someone at one of our retailers.
3952752	3955374	What John forgot to mention to people is that...
3956423	3958484	Why do you suppose that they're hard to find?
3958824	3963387	Is it because the game is so immensely popular that people are going to be buying it like crazy?
3963967	3966108	It could be, or it could be they didn't make enough.
3966709	3970571	Or it could be that they saw what happened with the Wii last year and they're like, we gotta do that.
3971391	3973592	No, you see, here's a little funny thing about this.
3975313	3981677	EA has never made a music game before, and they've never made music game controllers before.
3982472	3987041	and so they're having a little trouble making the music game controllers and guess what?
3987802	3993373	There's a lot of shortages because of that and because you pre-ordered one doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be getting one either.
3994294	3995076	Think the Wii again.
3996076	3996816	Let me put it this way.
3997236	3998057	Guitar Hero 3, yes.
3998117	3998757	Same thing with that.
3998937	3999937	Thanks a lot, John.
4000578	4009201	If there's ever a music game coming out that requires a guitar, a drum, a ukulele, whatever the fuck, it will be... Sitar.
4009561	4010041	Sitar.
4010401	4011342	Yes, Sitar Hero.
4011522	4018924	It will be very fucking hard to find because for some reason people have trouble making fake guitars.
4019745	4022946	So, if you have one pre-ordered, awesome.
4022966	4023426	If you don't,
4024685	4025285	You're fucked.
4026806	4027267	You better wait.
4028448	4031069	You can just take a broom and stick some old arcade buttons on it.
4031149	4032090	There you go, it's a guitar.
4032670	4036573	I will be getting one of these, only because I have to lie, cheat, and steal.
4038934	4047260	Well, if you don't want to wait around, or if you aren't lucky enough to get your hands on a copy of Rock Band, you can always wait for Harmonix's next game.
4047860	4049061	I need to take lessons in reading.
4049660	4050101	Harmonix Harmonix
4069696	4073058	So their next game will not have guitars.
4073179	4077061	They will be revealing some secrets about the game at next year's Game Developers Conference.
4077261	4078963	Oh, I know.
4079163	4080544	They're going to rip off DDR now.
4080784	4081484	Awesome.
4081604	4082745	Go Harmonix.
4082825	4083726	No, this is what they said.
4083926	4090130	Quote, beats would not be authored by tech-savvy musicians, but would instead be algorithmically generated.
4090651	4091171	Oh, awesome.
4091211	4091932	Dance Factory 2.
4093093	4095674	There won't be a dedicated peripheral for the game.
4096555	4096915	Awesome.
4097015	4098897	Amplitude million.
4098917	4099297	I don't know.
4100051	4103272	Hey, I would not mind a sequel to the Frequency Amplitude, you know.
4103312	4103992	I would be all for that.
4104012	4106954	Let's finish off that trilogy with a real awesome game.
4107014	4109835	Now that they have the, you know, they can get some badass tracks in that.
4110415	4110875	Come on.
4112075	4112716	I'm all for it.
4113256	4114736	Or they could just make Freeze pop the game.
4115437	4116397	I'm all for that, too.
4116497	4119138	By the way, let me take this opportunity to say, I will, uh,
4120463	4122343	Jump in here before Jamie reads her next story.
4122664	4125564	Freeze Pop is in Sacramento tonight in OLR headquarters.
4125584	4126824	They're playing a show downtown tonight.
4127225	4128105	I did not know this.
4128405	4130265	I swear to God, they go on stage in like two hours.
4130585	4132866	Shit, I wouldn't have been here if I had known that.
4133886	4134326	Sucker.
4134746	4135806	And here we are doing the show.
4135966	4138307	You know what I have is my alarm on my phone.
4138507	4140307	What's that, Science Genius Girl or something?
4140387	4142168	Nope.
4142928	4144008	We'll just sit here and wait, Jamie.
4144388	4145188	Yep, you better.
4145968	4148049	Except that I have news about Guitar Hero.
4148389	4148669	Uh-huh.
4149301	4150262	That's actually really cool.
4150542	4150803	Uh-huh.
4151363	4154686	So, uh... I'd love to hear that cool news.
4155687	4160572	I'm ready to... No, it's not Get Ready to Rock.
4160592	4161133	It's the other one.
4161853	4162614	Let's Talk More Rock.
4162734	4163094	Thank you.
4164015	4165877	Yeah, that's my actual ringtone right now.
4166117	4166358	Nice.
4166998	4170762	So, anyway... Oh, and... Money Python.
4171763	4172904	Anyway... That was so worth the wait.
4173284	4173825	Yeah, anyway...
4175839	4177179	I love my iPhone, I'm sorry.
4177540	4186823	So for anyone who is interested in the downloadable content for Guitar Hero 3, there has been a leak, which we hope is a real leak.
4189984	4198367	There is stuff listed as, let me see if I can, this thing is kind of hard for me to read.
4199005	4201927	because it's a picture taken off of a television.
4202768	4211175	But there were boss battle tracks listed, the ones you could pick and choose, so it was pretty interesting.
4211535	4215859	That would be great because you can't practice those in the game in practice mode, and it's pissing me off.
4216619	4217820	Because those boss battles are hard.
4217881	4225367	There's the Slash Guitar Battle, Devil Went Down to Georgia, Putting Holes in Happiness, The Pretender, This is a Call.
4225987	4226908	It's all on there.
4228038	4232139	Some of those are unlocked from the soundtrack, if I remember right, like the Putting Holes in Happiness and stuff.
4232159	4239362	Yeah, well, I almost bought the soundtrack just to, you know, see if, you know, how all that worked out.
4239422	4243063	But, of course, I'm cheap and so I didn't.
4243083	4243403	It's okay.
4243823	4244143	It's all right.
4246024	4251066	So, well, basically that is actually paid unlock content because that stuff is unlocked with a code.
4251166	4254447	So, well, just in regards to like the Putting Holes in Happiness.
4254467	4255307	No, it's not.
4257470	4263054	I stand corrected, my bad.
4265316	4265837	Next story, please.
4266397	4266757	Anyways.
4268779	4275364	So, Overlord, a game that I was playing quite a bit until Bioshock came out.
4277459	4279360	is getting some awesome download content.
4279520	4281721	Actually, three pieces of awesome download content.
4282861	4291745	One, of course, is free, and it actually allows you to play a multiplayer split-screen co-op game, which is kind of cool.
4291905	4296367	So, two overlords running around with 50 minions each, killing innocent people.
4297327	4301469	And then, of course, two of the other packs will cost you some points.
4301669	4301829	No...
4302930	4303430	Thanks for watching!
4331235	4336136	I have a freaking copy of the game and I still haven't had a chance to play it because I've just been so distracted with everything else.
4336196	4337616	Don't point and make evil eyes at me.
4337896	4338696	Don't give me evils.
4339597	4342637	Because I could be selling that game for... Don't give me evils.
4343037	4346998	I plan on playing it at some point.
4347178	4353299	Well, last week on this program, I believe Loki reported that IPTV was going to be a part of the new fall update.
4353339	4354980	Hey, it was a theory, okay?
4355000	4356460	I'm just setting him up.
4357260	4361805	That theory was nuked this week as Microsoft said, oh shit, we better make a statement on this.
4362345	4373155	And Microsoft came out and said, quote, Internet protocol television, IPTV features, will only be available from the Xbox 360 through a service provider who has deployed Xbox 360 with Microsoft Media Room services.
4373476	4381003	This is an isolated incident where these features were inadvertently exposed while the customer's console was being serviced and is unrelated to the fall update.
4381775	4382556	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4402210	4403311	In the fall.
4403511	4404071	No, it's in the middle.
4404091	4405252	It is now fall.
4405292	4405972	Check the clock.
4406012	4408093	No, I believe it's in the next few weeks.
4408553	4409754	Next couple weeks should be when.
4409894	4411955	I think last year was around the 12th or something like that.
4412115	4415797	I wonder what kind of cool shiz we're going to see in the updates since we're not seeing IPTV.
4415857	4416197	I know.
4416457	4416637	What?
4416838	4417298	Stuff.
4418038	4418398	Oh, yay.
4418438	4419219	I love stuff.
4419419	4420720	Hey, I got some stuff.
4421600	4421820	Yeah?
4422661	4422781	Yeah.
4422801	4423461	You got a salad?
4423881	4424201	No.
4425082	4425462	You ate it?
4425522	4426763	It has an anime.
4427523	4427963	An anime?
4428463	4428664	Yes.
4428944	4429324	What's that?
4431185	4431265	Um.
4433594	4437777	So for people who are fans of Blue Dragon, we get an anime release.
4438117	4446104	Of course, if Toriyama is involved in it, you know there's going to be an anime involved, which is why I wonder why we never got Chrono Trigger, but that's another story.
4446984	4452308	So yeah, Blue Dragon is going to have episodes coming to Xbox Live for free.
4452969	4456572	November 15th through January 1st, the episodes will all be there to download and
4457371	4480246	and it's more of a promotional thing for the budget edition that's going to be coming out for 29.40 yen which is 26 bucks here in the US and the fourth volume of Blue Dragon Anime is going to be out on DVD this month and by the way you have to live in Japan to get that for free
4480968	4481268	Oh yeah.
4481488	4486249	But does that trick still work where you can use a Japanese Yahoo account to sign in?
4486709	4489270	Or do they block that shit?
4489390	4496571	Remember how for a while we were signing in on a Japanese account to download game demos that weren't out here and stuff?
4496591	4499072	Well that reminds me, I have to download the Guilty Gear 2 demo.
4499892	4500392	Yes, it still works.
4500412	4500932	Can you still use it?
4500952	4503073	Because I thought a while they blocked that somehow.
4503413	4504293	Yeah, sure they did.
4505629	4507030	Oh yeah, they blocked it all right.
4507310	4508331	So they didn't do shit.
4508351	4510873	The Blue Dragon anime is only free in Japan.
4511013	4512454	Wink, wink, wink, nudge, nuzz.
4512594	4515537	But you don't have a Japanese Yahoo account or anything that you can sign up for.
4515557	4516998	You don't even need a Japanese Yahoo account.
4517038	4522342	I just have a Hotmail account that's like LokiOLRJP or something like that.
4522362	4523202	I don't even remember what it was.
4523663	4525965	Everybody sign that address up for all the porn you can.
4525985	4527406	It's really, really, really easy.
4527426	4527706	That's fine.
4527786	4530208	I don't check that address ever, so it doesn't matter.
4530708	4534131	But I also have the internet, so I'll just...
4534631	4534931	DarkSakura,
4553806	4559389	Well, first of all, hardly anybody in America, unless they happen to be watching Nickelodeon in the mid-early 90s.
4559449	4562290	Which was a fuckload of people, actually, in our generation.
4562311	4564191	To be honest, I know the fucking Tomorrow People.
4564392	4567233	But the Tomorrow People was like British sci-fi from the 70s.
4567513	4575137	I mean, it's been around for a while, probably a complete and utter ripoff from X-Men, but still, it was really cool.
4575397	4575898	You know what?
4576778	4578459	I loved 70s TV when I was a kid.
4578539	4581461	I grew up watching The Jeffersons and The Electric Company.
4581801	4582101	Oh, yeah?
4582121	4582201	Yeah.
4583775	4613068	but I've been watching the Tomorrow People on my iPhone alright sorry I'm reading something about later it's just a funny can you do now so we can end part A real quick there's a quote Miyamoto says wait until you see the Wii 5 years from now yay when they're going to finally support online fully and stuff oh I only have to wait 5 years awesome pulling off the wrapping slowly
4613957	4614817	Seriously?
4617919	4620340	Anyways, so other fun stuff.
4622601	4631085	Pirates vs. Ninjas, Dodgeball, such an awesome name for a game, I guess, has been confirmed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
4632005	4638788	However, they haven't really nailed down an exact time frame, but early 2008 is when it's expected, and
4639545	4646209	You'll truly be able to see who is better, pirates or ninjas, in the ancient art of dodgeball.
4646749	4647330	Or zombies.
4648050	4648611	Or zombies.
4649051	4656956	Hey, we're ignoring a very important class of, you know, of, uh, you know... Pinjas?
4657456	4658336	No, cowboys.
4659197	4660237	Fuck cowboys!
4660738	4661838	They ain't got nothing.
4661858	4662739	They're fucking pansies.
4662759	4664380	Ninja versus pirates versus cowboys.
4664460	4665821	Horse-riding losers.
4666462	4669363	We never saw movies about gay ninjas or gay pirates.
4670543	4671383	Not counting Johnny Depp.
4673104	4673904	That wasn't gay.
4673944	4676745	That was just, you know, Keith Richards.
4680666	4681026	Anyways.
4683967	4684387	Alrighty.
4685067	4688668	Well, I'm looking forward to seeing the ultimate pirate versus ninja showdown.
4688688	4691749	I mean, honestly, I think this is a brilliant idea for a video game.
4691869	4692810	Pirates versus ninjas.
4692830	4693830	Somebody's finally doing it.
4694771	4696012	Thanks for watching!
4715410	4716371	Now I lost my train of thought.
4716411	4716971	God damn you.
4717572	4720374	Oh, I was going to say Pirates vs. Ninjas.
4720875	4723998	Oh, the dodgeball game that they had on the NES back in the day.
4724118	4724818	That game was awesome.
4725199	4726500	Well, you can get it on the DS.
4726520	4727441	Remember the remake?
4727461	4728802	That was a Cuneo game.
4728862	4729082	Yes.
4730183	4730864	That was awesome.
4731704	4733226	Just put Pirates and Ninjas in that game.
4733286	4734047	How awesome is that?
4735268	4735668	Let's see.
4735708	4737209	TigerClaw says, Oh, I don't know.
4737289	4740252	Having cowboys would give the Pirates and Ninjas an unfair advantage.
4740352	4741513	Cowboys use guns.
4741573	4742274	So do Pirates.
4743511	4745312	Vampires use swords.
4745612	4748072	Yeah, they have ninja stars.
4748613	4754234	Honestly, I think that the two enemy classes should be ninja and cowboy.
4755014	4756575	And you have the pirate who's the hybrid.
4757635	4758835	On top of that, they can swim.
4759756	4760416	If they're a good pirate.
4760956	4761296	Nerd!
4763837	4764237	Lastly...
4765288	4765688	The N-Gage
4795001	4796462	Are you developing for the N-Gage?
4796622	4796782	What?
4797803	4803106	Apparently EA, Capcom, and Vivendi are all stepping up to develop for the N-Gage.
4804347	4804967	So there you have it.
4806568	4809290	The N-Gage service is coming soon.
4810845	4816307	Anyhow, coming to you right now is the classic video game of the week.
4816727	4826350	Every week, DarkSakura picks out a game from the archives of history that maybe I didn't know about before and says, damn it, you should be playing this game.
4826770	4830511	So, DarkSakura, please reveal for us your classic game of the week.
4831071	4832712	Sounded like you said DarkSakura.
4834381	4835502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4856300	4856760	Very cool.
4856800	4858462	I'm getting some sound here from Cyberbots.
4858502	4860583	Tell the kids about Cyberbots while I get the sound here.
4861124	4865507	Cyberbots is a fighting game that uses Mecha.
4866388	4875174	And you can choose different classes of Mecha and then each of them have three different ones that are in that class that have different types of weaponry.
4875654	4879217	So it's fairly customizable how you play it.
4880258	4884701	And it had these little cinema cutscenes and a cool storyline.
4885262	4885402	But
4886818	4887318	Puzzle Fighter
4915999	4926982	and, um, her, uh, she has the best robot in the entire game, the Super 8, which is a big octopus robot, so it's pretty cool.
4927342	4937926	Um, this game also had one of the best, um, hidden characters was Mecha Gouki, which is basically, you know, Gouki is Akuma over here from the Street Fighter series.
4938246	4942807	They have a Gouki robot that has all of his attacks and everything, it was pretty awesome.
4944046	4956597	Um, but also there was, uh, you know, for anyone now who goes back and plays Puzzle Fighter and you're here to see Devil Let's Go, you know, never heard of it, still to know Cyberbot is Capcom's number one game, that's what it is.
4956938	4962883	And it actually got a special edition that came with, like, a book in this big box, and it was really cool, um, on Saturn.
4963584	4970790	And you can actually still find the game for fairly reasonable, but it's, to me, it's actually, I think, one of Capcom's best games.
4971516	4971836	DarkSakura.com
4994847	4996068	It was arcade and Saturn.
4996568	4999791	More Sega love from DarkSakura.
5000011	5001532	Saturn was one of the best systems.
5001552	5003053	There was a lot of overlooked games on the Saturn.
5003073	5005135	You know what I did find related to Sega?
5005676	5008118	There's many ITX computers that people are building.
5008438	5012741	Someone built one out of a Sega CD and a Genesis.
5012761	5014343	I was looking on the site.
5014363	5014963	It was really cool.
5015444	5018066	Mine is collecting dust, by the way.
5019537	5023220	All right, well, that's going to bring part A of our show tonight to a close.
5023620	5031206	But we will be back very shortly with more of Orange Lounge Radio because we tape two halves in one night here on Sunday night and then release it twice throughout the week.
5031226	5033808	So you get more Orange Lounge Radio to listen to throughout the week.
5034208	5038031	So we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with a little more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5038471	5043455	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
5043916	5048219	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
