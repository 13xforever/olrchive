Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, November 11th, 2007, Manhunt 2 disappears from Target.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
New patch lets you play Boom Boom Rocket with your guitar.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And can your PlayStation 3 warranty be voided by dust?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hi everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Hi.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
How are you doing, Dark Sakura?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
I've been fed now. I'm feeling a lot better.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
You're full of burrito from one of our local joints, Aldebare Toast.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm not really supposed to be eating that.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Is this horchata?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
No, it's Diet Coke.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I love horchata.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I love horchata too, however, because this is pretty much the only other thing I've eaten today.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I figured a burrito wouldn't kill me.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Horchata's probably not very good for you because they taste like liquid churros.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Oh my god, they're so good though.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
For anyone who doesn't know what an horchata is, it's a sweet rice drink.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
It's delicious. It tastes like liquid churro.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
It's got cinnamon in it. It's really delicious.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Good times.

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
But the only other thing I had today was a low-carb tortilla with peanut butter on it.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
And I wasn't hungry after that. I was like, wow, I'm so not hungry.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
It's because peanut butter is awesome.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
And then I started getting hungry right before I had to leave the house.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
And then I started getting sleepy too, so I had caffeine and food.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Here we go turning into the food cast again.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Why is it at the beginning of every episode of Orange on the Radio or like the food cast?

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Because I always bring in my dinner and you have to comment on it.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm just jealous because I'm hungry.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I haven't really eaten.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So, I ate a little bit.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I have Belgian chocolate too.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I'm going to make you some spaghetti, Rob.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Do you have spaghetti?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
A spaghetti.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
All right.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Joining us as well, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Hello.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
How are you doing, Loki?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Doing good.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Awesome.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
What have you been playing over there on the PSP?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I was yelling at Loki just before the show to turn it down because I couldn't hear the regular stuff

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
because I was being distracted by the PSP.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
What are you playing on the PSP, Loki?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Silent Hill Origins.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Nice.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Good times?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Is it fun?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, it's pretty good.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Awesome.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, I'm sure we will hear more about that during the How Is Your Gaming Week,

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
which is our first segment we always get into.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Unfortunately, no guests in the studio tonight.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
It's just the three of us.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
But that's okay because we always have our fourth guest.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
No, we love the guests.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But many of them are having birthdays this week.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'll get to that in just a little bit.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
For now, I want to introduce the ever-present other guest on our program.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
It's all of you in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
for those of you guys that join us live when we tape on Sunday nights.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I understand there's some new folks in chat tonight.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
Joel Nier said he or she was new when they joined, so welcome, newbie.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And I'm not sure if we have any other newbies, but welcome to all the newbies in chat.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
We like new people.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
All right, let's start off with How Is Your Gaming Week.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Oh, wait.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, Dark Cyber's mouth is full of burrito and is unable to.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I don't talk with my mouth full.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
That's good.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm glad you have manners.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Like, a certain coworker of mine does.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Oh, my God.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Okay, that's getting to eff yous.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
This week, I was playing Cooking Mama.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm playing Eating Mama.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
Anyway, my gaming week, I actually did something other than Ragnarok.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
I look like I had to play a shitload of Ragnarok, but still.

03:34.000 --> 03:43.000
I got a level from zero, of course being Uber Noob, to, I think, 82 in three days.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Nerd.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It doesn't matter.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
So, anyway, I also played slash watched.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I played a little watched a lot of Portal.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Finally, and I've seen the ending, it's fucked up, and I love it.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
So, Dan's going to rent it for me from his store, because the good thing about being

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
a manager at GameCrazy is that he can get me free rentals at Hollywood Video.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
So, he's just going to bring me home Portal one day.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
And he said he was going to laugh at me when I got really motion sick.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
I was like, uh-uh, I'm going to stop every two levels.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Take a little breather.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Of course, it's like such a quick game.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
It's like, wow, this is three hours of quick.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, you know that is good gaming ethics, is that you're actually supposed to, if you

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
actually read an instruction manual, it says like you're supposed to take a break of 10

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
to 15 minutes for every like two hours of gameplay.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
That's not really ethics.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
That's self-care.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
How many folks really do, you're right, it's not really ethics.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
I don't know where I pulled that word from.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Ethics is not unplugging somebody else's controller.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Exactly.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
When they're kicking your ass at Street Fighter.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Which I've done, but I'm not an ethical gamer.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Anyway.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
But I want one of those shirts that they're plugging in the chat room.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, Tiger Claw is plugging a cake is a lie t-shirt.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
But they don't have girly shirts.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
They don't have them girl cut.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Oh, that sucks.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Wear a boy's shirt.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Girls can get away with that.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
It looks weird, though, if you've got big boobs.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Because you either have to get one that's really way too tight and uncomfortable.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
So if you have big boobs, then your shirt says, the cake is a lie.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Otherwise, you have to get one that's too big and looks all dumpy.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But my friend, though, has the best t-shirt ever.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
I have to share this with everybody.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
She has a shirt with two 20-sided die on.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It's set to 20.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
And says, yes, they're natural.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Nice.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I went to see my friend Becky yesterday.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
This is where I watched a whole bunch of Portal as we went over to a party that had cheesecake.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So I was going around all day saying the cheesecake was a lie.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
So that I wouldn't eat any.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
I'm surprised no one's had a Portal party yet.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
What they need to do is record the little music that's playing on the radio in there.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I know.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And just blast it on little radios.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
A Portal party, yay.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
And you could actually probably easily make one of the...

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
That's what I'm going to do for my next cosplay.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Don't you think that cosplay for Portal characters and stuff is going to be really popular, though?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I think it's...

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm just going to carry one of those little...

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Team Fortress 2, I think, is going to be popular.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm just going to carry one of those eyeball things around.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Or a weighted companion cube.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Everybody, you're invited to our Portal party.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Dress up like your favorite character.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
It'll be fun.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
What?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
All two of them?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Or three?

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
And the only time you actually see your character is you happen to be looking through another Portal.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Which is kind of...

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh my God, though.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
There's one part I got so nauseous.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
It's like this...

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I'm trying to remember exactly...

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Oh, I want one.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
That's so cute.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
A little plushy companion cube?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I want one, totally.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
But anyway, it's this one part...

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
And I don't remember exactly the puzzle, but you're trying to build up enough speed to jump across from one of the slanted platforms on top to the other side.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
And so you have to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and then shoot the other Portal and go through it so that you got enough momentum.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And I got so freaking sick.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I had to leave my room, but that was about it.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
You should try to get the achievement for the 30,000 foot drop or whatever.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
That'll make you sick.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You have to drop for six minutes.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
This was on a laptop, so the resolution was so high that it really, really bugged me.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
But it was very good.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So anything else for your gaming week?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I played World Cup Soccer in 1994.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Pinball?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Goal!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Good times.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
My gaming week was pretty full, actually.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Okay, so I did play Portal as well.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
I finished it as well.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
I also finished all the advanced levels, so that was fun.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
I like the little ball you get in one of those, too, that you have to carry it around.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
It's a level where you have the companion cube, but when you're playing advanced, it's like a little ball that bounces.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So it rolls around and stuff.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Not real fun.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
I do have to add that I love the automated weapons.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Oh, yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
What'd they say?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, they're cute.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Sorry.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Should I have a trash can that does that?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
That'd be cool.

08:12.000 --> 08:20.000
Anyways, ooh, they should make an automated one like that that shoots those soft pellet things.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
That would be great.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Or Nerf.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Okay, anyways, let's see.

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
Other things I played, Super Mario Galaxy, just flat out the best game for the Wii.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
I mean, that's it.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
It's the best Mario game I've played.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
It feels very, very, very much like Mario 64.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
The control's awesome.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Looks awesome.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You gotta buy it if you own a Wii.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
And if you don't own a Wii, you gotta buy a Wii so you can buy the game.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Then I played, what else did I play here?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Coruscant's Pro.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
I played lots of that.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Silent Hill Origins, just started that a little bit.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Looks very, very good on a PSP.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Very surprised.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
The smoke and fog looks amazing.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
But it's gonna be a great game.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
A lot of the reviews have said people like this out of the entire series.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Probably the best game.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
Another game I played that a lot of people are dying to get their hands on is Assassin's Creed.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And that one's a pretty unique game.

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
When you first start it, you're gonna understand why it's a little different than a lot of people had thought.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
A lot of weird sci-fi stuff in it, that's for sure.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
But it looks awesome.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It controls very easy.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
It's gonna be a great game.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
But the game I've been playing most this week, especially on the Wii, not Super Mario Galaxy, actually.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Ghost Squad on the Wii.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Probably the weirdest, dumbest shooter ever, but you gotta buy it.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
It's gonna be like 30 bucks, comes out in a couple weeks.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
I've been playing the Japanese version, which is all in English anyways.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
But it is fun.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
We've beat the game like three times today.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
And as you beat the game, you get experience points and you unlock new weapons that make the game harder.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
What exactly do you do in this game?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
It's just like time crisis.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
It's just, you know, shooting stuff.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
And it's just so cheesy and stupid, though.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
But as you finish the game, you also unlock different levels.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Or the levels get harder and they have different things that they add in there.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Works very well with the Wii Remote.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Great gun game.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Highly recommend it.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
It's a good game to spend like, you know, 50 bucks on Resident Evil.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Ghost Squad, definitely a good one to pick up.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
It also does support the Wii Zapper, although I don't have a Wii Zapper.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
And as far as I can tell, it only uses the remotes.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
So I don't know why the hell you would use a Wii Zapper with this anyways.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
But you can, I guess.

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
And then the last game I played, which is really crappy, is a game called Counter Force on the Wii.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
You might not have heard of it, and that's probably a good thing.

11:00.000 --> 11:05.000
It's people compared to, I guess, Star Fox, but it's no way near Star Fox.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
It is just a pile of shit, and you shouldn't play it.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
And I feel sorry for all the customers I sold that to.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Is it Shit Force?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It's just, it's crap.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Crap Force.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Why is it crap?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Shovelware, I guess.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Why is it crap? I'm trying to get people to elaborate.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Why is it crap? The graphics are very simple, very stupid.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
It doesn't control very well.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
It looks like it's thrown together really quick, almost like in Flash.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
It's just, I mean, a perfect example.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
There's a, in the very beginning one, you know how you pull up the title in a disc menu or whatever?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
It says Counter Force, and it has, you know, the company that made it.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
Well, there's this period out in the middle of nowhere because they didn't format it, right?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
And so the period's kind of moved over to the next line or something.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
It's just, it's really cheap looking, and it is a cheap game, so.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't know.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
From the makers of such wonderful games as Ninja Bread Man,

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
Anubis 2, and Billy the Wizard, Rocket Boomstick Racing,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
no, we are not ripping off of Harry Potter, even though we are.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That's a pretty impressive lineup, I don't know.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
I just played it because I knew it was going to be crap,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
and it's even crappier than I thought it was, so.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Odd1InChat, at chat.onechonserator.com, says,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Dumb shooters FTW, so agrees with your assessment of Ghost Squad.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Okay, let me put it this way.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Ghost Squad, as you play it, you unlock more stuff, like I said, weapons and stuff,

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
but later on, I'm not even sure where in the game,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
but later on, you get it so ridiculous where all the enemies are bikini-clad chicks.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
You're shooting a dolphin squirt gun at them instead of an actual gun.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
You can stealth kill somebody instead with a knife, with a banana,

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
and they're pursuing you in swan-shaped paddle boats instead of jet skis.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I mean, that's hilarious.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Suddenly, the chatroom is turned to talk about Ninja Bread Man.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
We have Gerardimo in chat says, Ninja Bread Man FTW.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Odd1 says, I got to love those guys just for the name Ninja Bread Man,

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
and ActDeaf descents and says, Ninja Bread Man looks crappy.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
I totally need one.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
There you have it.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Anything else you played this week?

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Actually, I did play one thing, but I don't really have much of an impression for it.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
Forever Blue, it's an underwater scuba diving sim for the Wii.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
It looks pretty.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I guess it's sort of like Pokemon Snap.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Unfortunately, the version I played was all in Japanese,

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
and I'm trying to get my hands on an English copy so I can actually understand what's going on.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
But you can play your own MP3s on it, like Excite Truck, so that's kind of cool.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
Except the MP3s I had in my cart at the time were from Excite Truck,

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
so it didn't really fit the underwater Enya that they have normal playing in the game.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
Instead, I have some rock and roll stuff, like paranoia something.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I don't know.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It was fine.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Nice.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Let's see, so my gaming week then, if you're all finished.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
I'm done.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Let's see, what did I play this week?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I played a little bit of World of Warcraft.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
I also kind of got sucked back into Final Fantasy XI a little bit.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
I've been leveling...

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Hi.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Hi, Jamie.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Is there anything you want to say to that?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Hi, Rob.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
No, I already gave you health for it the other day.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
I've been leveling Corsair in Final Fantasy XI, and Corsairs are awesome.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
Actually, I've decided that if I'm going to like Final Fantasy XI again,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I am going to not play by the rules,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
because one thing that totally pissed me off about Final Fantasy XI is that people were like,

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
well, if you're a Paladin, you have to sub Warrior, because you have to have Voke,

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
and if you're a White Mage, you really have to sub Black Mage, or maybe Summoner.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
There's all these freaking unsaid rules.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
You have to have this equipment.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
You have to.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
F that noise.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I am going to play this game how I want.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Therefore, I am going to be a Corsair Bard, because I like to buff people,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and both those classes are all about buffing people.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Corsairs are awesome because they're based around gambling,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
and Bards are awesome because they sing.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Basically, my character is a tacky Las Vegas nightclub act,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
because I gamble and I sing.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
It's awesome.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
If I played that again, I would totally play a White Mage Monk.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Good times.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
See, we should just have a party of people playing whatever the hell they want.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
But that makes sense, though, a White Mage and a Monk.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Let's see.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Dark Tetsuya says Rob likes to buff people.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Very funny jerk.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
What are you laughing at?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Oh, what?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
You have an aim chatter with a comment?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
I couldn't read it.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
What's it say?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Rob likes to buff people.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Buff people.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Shut up.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Shut up.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Let's see.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
So I've been playing a lot of that.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
I actually took Corsair from level 10 to level 17 in just a matter of days,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
so that should tell you about how much I was playing.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I also was playing on the Nintendo Wii a little bit,

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
because I was looking for the Check Me Out channel.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
It wasn't there yet, but I did download Super Mario Bros. 3,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
and I was playing a little bit of that, because that is a classic game.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
But I'll tell you what.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
When you play Super Mario Bros. 3,

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
if you're playing on a widescreen TV and you have it scrunched in,

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
you can see a lot of the graphical glitches that you didn't see back in the day on your regular TV,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
because the sides of the screen were cut off by your TV.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
You know how the old TVs have that rounded-ish screen,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
so you didn't really see the sides?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
There's hella graphical glitches in Super Mario Bros. 3.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I never really realized.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I remember there being some, but it's all right.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
It's still a fantabulous game, so it's great.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I need to buy Simon's Quest as well.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
I think you should bring Super Mario Bros. 3 on...

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Well, I know they already have it on Game Boy Advance and stuff,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
but do a new version on the DS,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
and have it randomly glitch out every now and then,

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
and you have to blow into your DS microphone to clean the cartridge out.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
That would be great.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
That would be the authentic Super Mario Bros. experience.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Jolnir in chat is asking,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
What about the new dancer job of Final Fantasy XI?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I am excited for the new jobs.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I think scholar and dancer look good.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
I hope there's a third one.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I would love to see Geomancer or something,

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
but I hear it's not going to happen.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
It's only going to be the two.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
My buddy Shane, who you've probably heard on the show,

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I don't know. There's only the two.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
They're going to say it's only the two jobs.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Well, dancer and what's the other one?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Scholar is the other one.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
What the fuck's scholar?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Scholar was kind of obscure.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
I think scholar was in Final Fantasy.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm smart.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Well, that's not going to help you in fighting enemies.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Scholar is a combination of white mage and black mage,

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
but they're not a red mage.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
They use what's called, I think it's called grimoire or something.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
They use this to basically strengthen the white magic

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
and weaken the black magic if you use a white scholar or a white grimoire

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
or there's the black one that will strengthen the black magic

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
and weaken the white magic, and they have their own unique spells.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So there's support for the support?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Sort of. The rumor is they get the reflect spell.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
They're going to have reflect, which is a spell that's missing from the game.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
So then they're going to basically be like the...

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
For lack of a better description, like the ones that reflect the enemy.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.440
well look here's what it really is is that the scholar artifact armor which is

17:55.440 --> 17:56.580
like the endgame honor

17:56.580 --> 18:00.500
armor is a school outfit so now you can actually be a Japanese schoolgirl in the

18:00.500 --> 18:01.760
game so that's

18:01.760 --> 18:05.120
that look let's just let's just go to the reality of yay job

18:05.120 --> 18:09.480
Japanese schoolgirls everywhere so I'm guessing that we're gonna see lots of

18:09.480 --> 18:11.360
I'll

18:11.360 --> 18:14.760
damn I've been out of Final Fantasy way too long serious mythra's

18:14.760 --> 18:18.400
too many mythra scholars in schoolgirl outfits

18:18.400 --> 18:21.960
be wonderful anyhow and then they could be

18:21.960 --> 18:26.000
asking for honestly I am looking more forward to galka dancers

18:26.000 --> 18:29.360
mythra scholar I'm dancers

18:29.360 --> 18:32.360
then that way they can be you know strippers right

18:32.360 --> 18:38.400
enough about a Final Fantasy love it I would say

18:38.400 --> 18:41.440
I'm what else I played on xbox I've been playing guitar here we had people over

18:41.440 --> 18:42.440
here last night because

18:42.440 --> 18:46.000
the night started at John's incredible pizza which is this chain

18:46.000 --> 18:49.360
I think mostly only exists in central California like Fresno I think is where

18:49.360 --> 18:49.880
it started

18:49.880 --> 18:53.000
but now it's up here in Roseville they have one our shows based out of

18:53.000 --> 18:54.560
Sacramento Roseville being a suburb

18:54.560 --> 18:58.720
I sometimes forget we have people all around the listen so anyway

18:58.720 --> 19:01.880
we're at this John's incredible pizza which is basically like a Dave and Busters for kids

19:01.880 --> 19:03.200
they have a big pizza buffet

19:03.200 --> 19:07.040
and like then they have this game room they actually have rides in the joint

19:07.040 --> 19:10.720
eat this place used to be a Sam's Club and they totally converted into this

19:10.720 --> 19:12.080
ginormous pizza place

19:12.080 --> 19:15.040
but they have video games and we started the night playing I was playing DDR

19:15.040 --> 19:15.840
Supernova

19:15.840 --> 19:19.400
and my boyfriend William is so hilarious because while I was playing

19:19.400 --> 19:23.120
this like lady in her probably her mid-thirties came up and she was

19:23.120 --> 19:24.880
watching me play she's like wow

19:24.880 --> 19:28.480
I wanna get this game for my kids and William is like totally selling the lady

19:28.480 --> 19:29.560
on this game he's like

19:29.560 --> 19:32.680
yeah like you see what he's doing is when the arrows go to the top of the

19:32.680 --> 19:36.000
screen he steps on it's just so funny Konami should be paying his so good at

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
selling stuff too

19:37.000 --> 19:40.160
he is he just will make you believe anything

19:40.160 --> 19:43.400
you should have a cult he totally could like sell

19:43.400 --> 19:46.920
like games or anything like William could have his own cult yes

19:46.920 --> 19:50.440
he's great I one of these days I will let him come on the show and so that

19:50.440 --> 19:52.240
would be fantastic he's hilarious

19:52.240 --> 19:56.560
so he was very funny at dinner by the way he's the best he's the best anyway

19:56.560 --> 20:01.040
yeah they're all in central California I need to I need to stop gushing so much

20:01.040 --> 20:01.440
anyway

20:01.440 --> 20:05.880
I here's the other thing about John's Incredible Pizza that I thought was

20:05.880 --> 20:09.560
hilarious is that it pretty much outside of DDR in some random shooter games

20:09.560 --> 20:14.200
it was all ticket games like you know gambling for kids basically right

20:14.200 --> 20:19.080
but my god ticket games have come a long way since I was a kid

20:19.080 --> 20:22.360
like I remember when I was a kid it was all about whack-a-mole like if the

20:22.360 --> 20:24.720
Chuck E. Cheese had whack-a-mole that was the shit right

20:24.720 --> 20:27.640
and like you play that with your hands and stuff not just a big mallet but your friends

20:27.640 --> 20:28.280
would play too

20:28.280 --> 20:32.640
now they have deal or no deal but with tickets

20:32.640 --> 20:37.240
and you actually play this game and like the banker offers you like 50 tickets

20:37.240 --> 20:41.400
to buy out your case or whatever because basically the show but with tickets I

20:41.400 --> 20:42.920
couldn't believe it I was like floored

20:42.920 --> 20:46.320
but then this place had rides in it like it had a roller coaster inside which I

20:46.320 --> 20:47.240
thought was crazy

20:47.240 --> 20:52.520
kind of a fun little place I'm sure they'll do well. Gerardo says deal or no

20:52.520 --> 20:54.200
deal is too expensive to play

20:54.200 --> 20:57.200
Act F says yay gambling is good for you

20:57.200 --> 21:00.760
GS68 says jump in jackpot dude this place had not one

21:00.760 --> 21:05.480
but two jump in jackpot machines and for those in New York City that went when I

21:05.480 --> 21:07.320
was there we had the OLR meetup

21:07.320 --> 21:10.560
I got further in jumping jackpot than I ever have before I don't know if the machine

21:10.560 --> 21:11.840
was set to an easier difficulty

21:11.840 --> 21:15.680
but I got all the way to like the O in jackpot and then I lost I was so

21:15.680 --> 21:16.280
pissed

21:16.280 --> 21:19.960
anyhow jump in jackpot is that jump rope game

21:19.960 --> 21:23.200
with the random eurobeat music that sounds like flame in finger

21:23.200 --> 21:26.800
I've never seen it but I love flame in finger. We are going to this place

21:26.800 --> 21:30.680
but on a weeknight because I was pissed because the place is out of beer mugs

21:30.680 --> 21:32.040
how do you run out of beer mugs

21:32.040 --> 21:35.720
well go after my pay day we will and then I'm gonna buy that t-shirt

21:35.720 --> 21:39.200
awesome the cake is a lie shirt yes good times

21:39.200 --> 21:43.000
so what was I gonna say oh yes so since they were out of beer mugs the idea was to come

21:43.000 --> 21:45.760
back to my place and drink so everybody came over those of us that went out

21:45.760 --> 21:46.920
there's about seven of us that went out

21:46.920 --> 21:50.640
and we came back here we played guitar hero and everybody was learning how to

21:50.640 --> 21:53.680
play William played for the first time and some other people I just met were

21:53.680 --> 21:55.520
playing for the first time we were all having a good time

21:55.520 --> 21:58.560
so guitar hero great party game even though I only have one guitar

21:58.560 --> 22:01.840
but I've been playing through that I finally got some achievements for getting all the five

22:01.840 --> 22:02.720
stars on medium

22:02.720 --> 22:06.920
and now I'm finally working on hard and expert songs and it's hard

22:06.920 --> 22:10.600
you know I could come over one day and bring one of my controllers

22:10.600 --> 22:13.640
you should we should rock out do some co-op be fun

22:13.640 --> 22:17.000
I want rock bands so much and I do want to say this

22:17.000 --> 22:20.920
that Dragonforce song is the fucking shit I'd love that song

22:20.920 --> 22:24.360
seriously but here's the thing I noticed about Dragonforce like I was like so

22:24.360 --> 22:25.000
like

22:25.000 --> 22:29.280
into that song even though playing it sucks like I was so into that song

22:29.280 --> 22:33.400
I went and looked them up on iTunes and seriously all of their songs sound

22:33.400 --> 22:34.840
exactly the same yeah

22:34.840 --> 22:38.360
my friend has about a CD of them they're awesome wait I'm gonna

22:38.360 --> 22:42.680
hold on I'm gonna look them up on the store real quick

22:42.680 --> 22:46.280
and play some of this for you guys I don't know how well it's gonna run

22:46.280 --> 22:49.640
though because we have the webcam going so it's kinda slow

22:49.640 --> 22:53.320
that's pretty much all I want to say about my gaming week

22:53.320 --> 22:55.960
anything anybody else want to add anything on their gaming weeks before we

22:55.960 --> 22:58.040
move on

22:58.040 --> 23:01.320
um no okay okay here's

23:01.320 --> 23:04.840
here's the here's the song from Guitar Hero let me see if this will actually play

23:04.840 --> 23:07.640
it might be too slow and I was trying to sync with my ipod

23:07.640 --> 23:09.800
too

23:22.600 --> 23:25.000
rock

23:25.000 --> 23:28.520
this should be a DDR song doesn't that sound like doesn't that sound like a

23:28.520 --> 23:31.960
song from hell for Guitar Hero okay here is some of their other music

23:31.960 --> 23:36.360
here's a song called operation ground and pound

23:37.880 --> 23:42.200
it's loading give it a moment apparently

23:48.120 --> 23:51.560
pretty much sounds exactly the same right also would be a hellacious song

23:51.560 --> 23:54.280
Guitar Hero

23:54.280 --> 23:58.040
I totally want to drive to this

23:59.400 --> 24:03.480
this is gonna be my custom soundtrack to burn out um okay one more for you guys

24:03.480 --> 24:06.840
revolution death squad

24:07.560 --> 24:11.640
here we go oh god

24:15.400 --> 24:18.840
they really do sound the same

24:18.840 --> 24:24.280
you can make ringtones out of them that's great

24:24.280 --> 24:28.280
I hear though that the drummer is actually drumming that

24:28.280 --> 24:31.720
you know oh god that's so crazy cry for eternity hold on one more

24:31.720 --> 24:36.840
one more this band is awesome

24:40.680 --> 24:43.320
that's cool

24:43.320 --> 24:46.920
well there's a drummer doesn't have to have any talent

24:46.920 --> 24:53.640
I mean wait can you imagine what these concerts must be like

24:53.640 --> 25:00.760
like people die it'd be like a it'd be like a um death clock uh

25:00.760 --> 25:04.840
concert dragon force is like one of my new favorite bands seriously

25:04.840 --> 25:08.360
you hear however I will tell you why Guitar Hero 3 pisses me off as well as

25:08.360 --> 25:13.880
rock band you know why these games piss me off lack of journey you know what I

25:13.880 --> 25:17.640
think that you know what band really needs to be in Guitar Hero

25:17.640 --> 25:23.160
it's freaking dream theater just find something by dream theater

25:23.160 --> 25:25.800
they're great and it's like some of the best

25:25.800 --> 25:31.160
guitar in the universe and they're not in Guitar Hero

25:31.160 --> 25:36.920
um azhp says most relaxing game ever plus dragon force equals win

25:36.920 --> 25:41.640
that is the perfect music for you put that in your little like

25:41.640 --> 25:44.920
ocean exploring game

25:47.800 --> 25:52.520
it should be like a katamari game for real um carizzle says I would be all

25:52.520 --> 25:55.800
over a dragon force downloadable content pack for Guitar Hero 3

25:55.800 --> 25:59.000
I refuse to pay the high prices but I would just have to if they came out with

25:59.000 --> 26:01.960
the dragon force pack I bought the foo fighters one what can I

26:01.960 --> 26:05.640
say I like riders what we need to do is we need to do a video segment

26:05.640 --> 26:08.840
crappy games that are made better through dragon force

26:08.840 --> 26:13.960
I love this idea I love this idea I fully support that thought crappy games

26:13.960 --> 26:17.320
made better with the music of dragon force this is a brilliant idea

26:17.320 --> 26:19.960
patent pending nobody better copy that shit because we're going to put it out

26:19.960 --> 26:23.400
there on the internet love it what would be what would be a crappy

26:23.400 --> 26:26.520
game we can make better with with music from dragon force

26:26.520 --> 26:30.040
barbie island princess

26:30.440 --> 26:34.520
actually I don't think that has custom soundtracks is not a 360 but like well

26:34.520 --> 26:38.200
it doesn't matter what game because like you can turn the eva pinata party

26:38.200 --> 26:41.560
animals yes because it has racing fusion frenzy

26:41.560 --> 26:49.320
fusion fusion frenzy too oh you know I think that the last really

26:49.320 --> 26:52.600
awful game because you know usually I wait to play a game until I'm sure I'm

26:52.600 --> 26:56.680
really gonna like it I remember renting a game though one time

26:56.680 --> 27:00.600
from blockbuster that was so bad we went back and asked for our money back

27:00.600 --> 27:05.800
and they gave it to us it was one of those uh wrestling games back in the day

27:05.800 --> 27:10.760
ww a thunder I was just I would have liked to have

27:10.760 --> 27:15.160
dragon force would have made that game better remember that game um uh

27:15.160 --> 27:19.480
vib ribbon where you could use your own music put your own music in there let's

27:19.480 --> 27:22.520
do that rob yes seriously I have the ribbon we

27:22.520 --> 27:25.400
should do that but remember you remember what happened

27:25.400 --> 27:27.720
where we put in like a slow song and it was freaking hard

27:27.720 --> 27:31.080
do we think we do you think we get dragon force on the show

27:31.080 --> 27:35.960
i'm gonna email them why not why not well it doesn't hurt find their who

27:35.960 --> 27:38.840

27:42.440 --> 27:45.880

29:24.520 --> 29:27.240
park no i don't watch tv it was a parody of

29:27.240 --> 29:31.320
guitar hero and it was kind of funny like it wasn't lol funny but it was you

29:31.320 --> 29:34.200
know haha uh it was like a parody of rock

29:34.200 --> 29:37.800
superstardom but with guitar hero but i'll tell you what the funniest part

29:37.800 --> 29:41.160
was the very end when stan and kyle are finally reunited

29:41.160 --> 29:44.360
and they uh are gonna break a million points in guitar hero jamie you'll get a

29:44.360 --> 29:56.760
kick out of this

29:56.760 --> 30:02.040
they did it oh my sweet jesus you have played guitar hero enough to

30:02.040 --> 30:19.080
reach 1 million points congratulations that's it

30:19.080 --> 30:22.680
now you think i would be offended or something but seriously that shit's

30:22.680 --> 30:24.840
hilarious like i was on the ground laughing

30:24.840 --> 30:28.600
but the funniest part was my roommate walked in and he hadn't seen any of the

30:28.600 --> 30:31.960
episode he just saw like the very end and when he saw that his and he's

30:31.960 --> 30:34.920
watched me play guitar hero like tons throughout the day his jaw was just

30:34.920 --> 30:37.800
like on the ground like i can't believe they just said that

30:37.800 --> 30:43.480
but it was funny i totally want an icon of their expressions in that picture

30:43.800 --> 30:49.320
you are fags that was awesome

30:50.360 --> 30:54.920
anyhow let's get into tonight's oh wait really quickly one more housekeeping

30:54.920 --> 30:58.120
thing i'm so horrible this week marks the fifth

30:58.120 --> 31:01.880
anniversary of xbox live can you believe it november 15th is the day that

31:01.880 --> 31:05.640
xbox live turns five which made me think this week one we're

31:05.640 --> 31:09.640
older than xbox live because we're five and a half years old

31:09.640 --> 31:12.760
but still we were here from the beginning rock on

31:12.760 --> 31:16.040
for xbox live turning five this week and they're doing like all these types of

31:16.040 --> 31:18.120
contests and who knows what other kind of crap

31:18.120 --> 31:23.960
is going to be up on xbox like cool you know uh retrospective stuff and

31:23.960 --> 31:28.280
maybe some new trailers and icons and backgrounds and

31:28.280 --> 31:30.440
i'm sure they're going to celebrate over there

31:30.440 --> 31:34.440
the reason why i say that is that xbox live is very good with the community

31:34.440 --> 31:37.960
you know like out of probably the big three nintendo sony microsoft microsoft

31:37.960 --> 31:41.000
is very good with the community and i think therefore

31:41.000 --> 31:43.320
the community should support them for you know

31:43.320 --> 31:46.600
um reaching out and caring about the independent scene

31:46.600 --> 31:51.320
so hurrah to you guys at xbox speaking of xbox let's get into tonight's gaming

31:51.320 --> 31:56.360
news loki kick it off yes so um the fall updates coming

31:56.360 --> 32:00.360
just might not be for fall um it's actually going to be hitting

32:00.360 --> 32:05.560
um on well sometime in december and uh one thing that will be coming with it of

32:05.560 --> 32:09.160
course is the xbox 360 family timer of course that is going to be something

32:09.160 --> 32:13.560
that your parents will be able to use to limit the time that kiddies get to play

32:13.560 --> 32:16.600
um you can limit it down to like two hours

32:16.600 --> 32:20.360
and then after those two hours up they have to play or wait 24 hours before they

32:20.360 --> 32:24.600
can play um their xbox 360 again i think that's an

32:24.600 --> 32:27.160
awesome idea that they're able to limit stuff like

32:27.160 --> 32:33.000
that um playtime uh no word though what else

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
will be coming um on that update as well but of course

32:37.000 --> 32:40.760
usually with those dashboard updates there's a bit more stuff on there

32:40.760 --> 32:45.000
uh hopefully some more video playback stuff so we can play some divx maybe

32:45.000 --> 32:49.080
xvid that would be nice good times high more high def stuff over the uh

32:49.080 --> 32:52.520
inner or over not the internet but the local network be awesome

32:52.520 --> 32:56.840
then i can watch my dragon force music videos be awesome they have music videos

32:56.840 --> 32:59.880
on itunes there's some for sale and they're just as epic as you'd think

32:59.880 --> 33:03.720
just go to youtube there you go uh last week if you're listening to last

33:03.720 --> 33:07.960
week's show um we were kind of joking uh probably more than we needed to about

33:07.960 --> 33:11.480
kmart remember our kmart and one thing that

33:11.480 --> 33:14.760
came up what we're talking about is that one of the good things that kmart is

33:14.760 --> 33:18.920
there for is that they tend to break street dates and that was totally proven

33:18.920 --> 33:20.920
this week i would like to see did we call it or

33:20.920 --> 33:25.640
did we call it on last week's show sure enough kmart has been spotted with

33:25.640 --> 33:30.040
copies of mass effect uh kmart sold a copy of mass

33:30.040 --> 33:33.800
effect it looks like in uh cropped in maryland is where they

33:33.800 --> 33:36.040

friday or yesterday uh that's 10 days before the official release date of the

33:43.960 --> 33:45.560
game and of course the guy bought it and

33:45.560 --> 33:48.360
promptly put a picture of it up on the internet with the receipt so you knew he

33:48.360 --> 33:52.040
wasn't full of crap so uh everybody's saying run and check

33:52.040 --> 33:54.360

35:06.760 --> 35:10.360
fallen in love um by the buzzcocks i fought the law by

35:10.360 --> 35:12.840
the clash and rockaway beach by the ramones it's like

35:12.840 --> 35:17.560
classic there um then there's some uh single songs which is fortunate son by

35:17.560 --> 35:21.400
credence clearwater revival um jukebox hero by foreigner my

35:21.400 --> 35:25.080

35:36.600 --> 35:40.360
oh i was gonna say there's one that's on there uh buddy holly by weezer

35:40.360 --> 35:43.640

there's one song in that as much as i love weezer but there's one song in

35:47.800 --> 35:52.520
there that completely just makes me go haha my iron lung by radio

35:52.520 --> 35:55.160
head i love radio head that's pretty awesome

35:55.160 --> 35:59.320
i love radio head you know creep is in the actual game as well

35:59.320 --> 36:03.480
i know but i love radio head but i would like to point out there is still a

36:03.480 --> 36:07.560
distinct lack of journey in this list hey give it time give it

36:07.560 --> 36:10.440
time i want my fucking don't stop believing damn it

36:10.440 --> 36:13.320
maybe they're the ones maybe it's journeys fault of this stuff isn't it

36:13.320 --> 36:16.120
maybe they're like little bitches that don't have their fucking music to be in

36:16.120 --> 36:18.120
this game now fuck this we remember the journey

36:18.120 --> 36:21.560
game it sucked we're just not gonna put our music in anything radio head

36:21.560 --> 36:25.720
radio head is cool i'll take that radio head well you know i was still on the

36:25.720 --> 36:29.720
fence about rock band and i'm like uh i don't want to spend the 170 on the

36:29.720 --> 36:32.920
game but then i was watching some trailers online last night and

36:32.920 --> 36:36.600
keep in mind i was kind of drunk like we drank a lot last night and we were

36:36.600 --> 36:39.800
having the people over here to guitar hero and we were just all in here

36:39.800 --> 36:44.760
watching the rock band footage going oh we need to get this game it looks so

36:44.760 --> 36:47.560
high i'm definitely getting there i think i'm gonna have to get it my wife

36:47.560 --> 36:51.160
is gonna buy it for me for christmas oh we've already decided to get it

36:51.160 --> 36:54.440
well it looks like we're gonna have our own little band and hopefully i'll have

36:54.440 --> 36:59.240
it early awesome uh odd one says

36:59.240 --> 37:03.880
yes my iron lung is my fave song of the bends that is so spectacular

37:03.880 --> 37:07.960
that is such a good although i have to say overall my my all-time

37:07.960 --> 37:11.640
favorite radio head song is high and dry i know i was gonna say i want high and

37:11.640 --> 37:15.880
dry don't leave me but that wouldn't be so

37:15.880 --> 37:19.800
rock bandy yeah you know what i mean my iron lung is

37:19.800 --> 37:23.560
probably one of the perfect ones to have in that and mac man in our chat room is

37:23.560 --> 37:28.120
urging me to hold on to that feelings guy

37:28.120 --> 37:31.880
i will i will i'm gonna write journeys fan club or something and

37:31.880 --> 37:35.560
and make you know somebody who knows the band that's right

37:35.560 --> 37:38.840
i keep forgetting we know we have a friend who we have a friend journey he

37:38.840 --> 37:42.760
bought he gave me guitar picks from that this to happen if you're listening said

37:42.760 --> 37:45.000
friend i need to have some words with journey

37:45.000 --> 37:49.960
can we make that happen anyhow you get them on the show for real

37:49.960 --> 37:53.000
we should just have a completely night dedicated to the greatest like even

37:53.000 --> 37:56.040
though our show's about video games the hell with it we'll put it aside for a

37:56.040 --> 37:58.200
night and talk to all the great you know guitar

37:58.200 --> 38:01.560
bands we've always wanted to have your special just get random people on just

38:01.560 --> 38:04.760
ask them about games you think these people don't play games i'm sure dragon

38:04.760 --> 38:07.160
force plays a shitload of video games as does

38:07.160 --> 38:09.800
you know journey and all these other bands what else are they going to do on

38:09.800 --> 38:15.320
the road other than heroin anyways um

38:15.320 --> 38:18.840
so as i mentioned last week with rock band of course

38:18.840 --> 38:23.640
there's going to be quite a shortage with rock band this holiday season

38:23.640 --> 38:28.280
and that also will probably be the case with guitar hero 3 in fact

38:28.280 --> 38:31.640
uh during activisions quarterly earnings call

38:31.640 --> 38:37.240
uh company ceo robert cotic said that there's probably there's a

38:37.240 --> 38:40.840
probability that this holiday we won't be able to supply all the demand for

38:40.840 --> 38:44.520
every platform while a probability isn't quite on

38:44.520 --> 38:47.880
par with of course the you know comment from

38:47.880 --> 38:50.760
ea saying that there's really not going to be a lot out there

38:50.760 --> 38:53.960
um there's a pretty good chance it's going to be hard to find

38:53.960 --> 38:57.160
and from the other side that i you know of course

38:57.160 --> 39:01.000
my work side i can definitely say that there's one hell of a shortage on

39:01.000 --> 39:05.400
guitar hero already so don't be surprised there's a part of me that

39:05.400 --> 39:08.360
can't help but wonder if this is a little bit intentional you know what i

39:08.360 --> 39:11.480
mean like isn't it just a coincidence that rock band is going to be in short

39:11.480 --> 39:13.720
supply and i'll tell you why short supply i'll

39:13.720 --> 39:19.000
tell you why they're like that and it's only in short supply um in one

39:19.000 --> 39:23.240
one way because the bundles that come with the new guitars

39:23.240 --> 39:27.320
are in short supply it's because these new designs for the guitars and stuff

39:27.320 --> 39:32.200
don't get finalized until it's too late same reason with rock band that's why

39:32.200 --> 39:35.800
the bundle for rock band is hard to find or going to

39:35.800 --> 39:39.240
be hard to find because they didn't finalize the design until it's too late

39:39.240 --> 39:43.240
same with um guitar hero 3 one thing that they're doing to kind of to help

39:43.240 --> 39:46.200
alleviate this if you don't give a shit about having a wireless guitar

39:46.200 --> 39:49.880
they will sell specialized bundles for retailers that

39:49.880 --> 39:53.080
come with the explorer guitar from guitar hero 2

39:53.080 --> 39:56.760
those are going to be readily available but it's just getting the game with that

39:56.760 --> 40:00.200
new guitar is going to be hard to find so if you don't care about having a new

40:00.200 --> 40:02.200
guitar i mean because to be honest it's wireless

40:02.200 --> 40:05.240
big deal you know the wired one works just fine

40:05.240 --> 40:11.240
but you know if that's the case then get the game by itself by guitar later

40:11.240 --> 40:14.120
but that that's the thing that's why it's because of these new instruments

40:14.120 --> 40:17.640
and i bet you anything if they change the design of the guitar for guitar hero

40:17.640 --> 40:22.440
4 we're going to be talking about this all over again so that's why

40:22.440 --> 40:28.280
well thank you for that report well uh if you have guitar hero 3 there's

40:28.280 --> 40:30.920
already some downloadable content available for it like i mentioned

40:30.920 --> 40:33.560
earlier i downloaded the foo fighters pack for the game

40:33.560 --> 40:37.400
uh that is up and running when the foo fighters pack has the pretender

40:37.400 --> 40:40.680
all my life and the classic this is a call it was like the very first single i

40:40.680 --> 40:43.000
think although you know what it was sadly

40:43.000 --> 40:46.920
missing was a ever long but i think that song was in guitar hero 2 so i think

40:46.920 --> 40:50.600
that's why b big me that's that song was awesome it

40:50.600 --> 40:53.400
had the mentos in the video remember that back when mtv

40:53.400 --> 40:57.080
played videos velvet revolver also has a pack of their

40:57.080 --> 41:00.040
own i didn't buy it yet because i'm not as familiar with velvet revolver but

41:00.040 --> 41:03.960
maybe i i hear they actually put trailers on xbox live of these packs

41:03.960 --> 41:07.080
so you could hear the songs beforehand which is great i think it was a great

41:07.080 --> 41:10.200
way to kind of answer that demand of we want to hear this shit before we buy it

41:10.200 --> 41:14.360
so props to microsoft for getting around that um but velvet revolver if you uh do

41:14.360 --> 41:16.120
want to buy that if you're a fan of the band

41:16.120 --> 41:18.760
because i do believe velvet revolver is the band that's made up of it wasn't

41:18.760 --> 41:21.000
that stone temple pilots plus uh the guy from sound garden

41:21.000 --> 41:24.440
i do believe that chris cornell chris cornell has

41:24.440 --> 41:29.160
or my had a difference in my group band sorry i haven't been following my rock

41:29.160 --> 41:32.760
bands very well no maybe i'm gonna get yelled at by chat i think it was i think

41:32.760 --> 41:35.480
chris cornell had a different band but i think it was somebody else that was in

41:35.480 --> 41:38.680
sound garden i want to say all right well if you get

41:38.680 --> 41:41.480
velvet revolver it's uh she builds quick machines

41:41.480 --> 41:45.080
slither and messages are the bands that you will or the songs you will get in

41:45.080 --> 41:49.720
the velvet revolver pack the um packs are 500 microsoft points

41:49.720 --> 41:52.280
which you will remember was a bit controversial because that's how much

41:52.280 --> 41:55.560
they charge for the old packs but now when you consider these games

41:55.560 --> 41:59.240
haven't been in the game before and they are actually downloadable songs

41:59.240 --> 42:01.480
you're not you're not unlocking shit that's already on the disc

42:01.480 --> 42:04.920
velvet revolver is members of guns and roses oh shit

42:04.920 --> 42:09.320
and uh scott wayland who the oh okay i had i had it the other way around or

42:09.320 --> 42:11.480
something what the hell am i thinking of they had

42:11.480 --> 42:16.280
the guy from sound garden chris cornell audio slave that was damn it

42:16.280 --> 42:20.520
because i was like yeah he has a different band although

42:20.520 --> 42:24.600
anyway sorry my bad

42:24.920 --> 42:27.960
look i listen to pop music all right it's gonna mention one thing real quick

42:27.960 --> 42:31.160
unless it's dragon force or journey since the story didn't make it into the

42:31.160 --> 42:34.440
um show role sure it was too late uh the we

42:34.440 --> 42:38.280
guitar hero 3 it only outputs in mono go

42:38.280 --> 42:42.280
monophonic sound go nintendo ouch actually it's probably

42:42.280 --> 42:47.320
activation yay mono

42:47.960 --> 42:50.280
well

42:50.760 --> 42:54.920
well there is something for anyone who is uh looking forward to playing guitar

42:54.920 --> 43:01.160
hero 3 on the pc is the 360s wireless um les paul controller will work

43:01.160 --> 43:07.400
on the pc it's not officially supported but it will work you just need the xbox

43:07.400 --> 43:14.360
360 wireless gaming receiver um however um the pc version is

43:14.360 --> 43:18.120
not uh it actually already comes out with a guitar

43:18.120 --> 43:24.760
with the gibson explorer um but i guess if you want to do two player

43:24.760 --> 43:27.000
here you go well that makes sense i mean considering

43:27.000 --> 43:31.320
that you know they're just controllers and i could see

43:31.320 --> 43:35.320
why they wouldn't of course add the um wireless gaming

43:35.320 --> 43:38.120
receiver with it you know might as well do the wired version

43:38.120 --> 43:44.440
so well the other thing though um i i actually um when we were at best

43:44.440 --> 43:47.160
buy i think it was we actually saw a two guitar pack

43:47.160 --> 43:53.320
for um guitar hero 3 yeah and i think that it would be pointless for them to

43:53.320 --> 43:56.760
not release the same kind of pack for pc as well

43:56.760 --> 44:02.520
i mean really there's so many like usb guitars out there now with you know

44:02.520 --> 44:06.280
guitar hero just find one that you want and then buy it

44:06.280 --> 44:09.000
well the explorer controller was kind of ugly

44:09.000 --> 44:12.440
plus they figure you know that you you're buying all these games your

44:12.440 --> 44:14.680
friends probably own some of the games you're gonna play two player if your

44:14.680 --> 44:17.320
friend you come over have them bring their own guitar

44:17.320 --> 44:22.280
i would like for you to spend more vyog

44:22.680 --> 44:26.280
i'm sorry the les paul is a lot more hot um well

44:26.280 --> 44:29.560
this is kind of going back a couple months but uh people might remember that

44:29.560 --> 44:32.680
there were some issues with the wide screen in um

44:32.680 --> 44:38.200
the xbox 360 version of bioshock well 2k is going to be fixing these

44:38.200 --> 44:41.560
problems very soon with the next update that's going to be coming out so

44:41.560 --> 44:45.720
all you people can stop bitching about it although i think a lot of people have

44:45.720 --> 44:49.080
stopped bitching about it and moved on to other games like halo 3 and

44:49.080 --> 44:52.120
games are possibly coming out next week so

44:52.120 --> 44:55.880
i don't know but bioshock is still a great game oh yeah it's an awesome game

44:55.880 --> 44:57.640
yeah highly recommend playing through it at

44:57.640 --> 45:01.080
least once the only reason people will probably be opting for halo 3 instead is

45:01.080 --> 45:03.960
because the multiplayer that's the one thing bioshock unfortunately was missing

45:03.960 --> 45:06.920
it needed it could have used some multiplayer that would have been pretty

45:06.920 --> 45:09.560
cool bioshock 2 you have to have something for

45:09.560 --> 45:13.320
bioshock 2 right yeah well speaking of halo 3 which a lot of

45:13.320 --> 45:16.680
people are turning to you might remember a few weeks ago we

45:16.680 --> 45:18.760
talked about actually it's probably about a couple months ago at this point

45:18.760 --> 45:22.200
we talked about the guy who uh sent the marriage proposal in viva pinata

45:22.200 --> 45:25.160
and i'm sure we've had i think there was the story of the marriage proposal in

45:25.160 --> 45:28.520
world of warcraft well now we have a story tonight about

45:28.520 --> 45:33.080
a halo 3 marriage proposal yes it was somebody using the forge uh

45:33.080 --> 45:37.400
the map editor inside halo 3 to lay down guns and swords

45:37.400 --> 45:42.920
in the shape of the words marry me question mark

45:42.920 --> 45:47.640
very cute what was the answer i'm assuming it was yes but we don't know

45:47.640 --> 45:53.000
all we really know is the screenshot the answer was boom headshot

45:53.000 --> 45:56.200
yes she said yes and then promptly shot him in the head and then

45:56.200 --> 46:01.800
proceeded to hump his corpse the end which might be like the honeymoon who

46:01.800 --> 46:05.720
knows uh anyway la la la la la la la la la

46:05.720 --> 46:10.920
the xbox user was movie sign and he was proposing to his longtime girlfriend

46:10.920 --> 46:14.520
for it furtive penguin

46:15.000 --> 46:19.960
i love xbox live names i don't know why it came up the other night but somebody

46:19.960 --> 46:23.320
was suggesting i changed my xbox live tag to sergeant sausage and i actually

46:23.320 --> 46:27.560
kind of like that name that's cool you should totally do that

46:27.560 --> 46:32.360
if it's getting taken yeah if nobody the news for the next step though is they

46:32.360 --> 46:37.320
need to do a custom game no time limit and then have the actual

46:37.320 --> 46:40.600
wedding procession in game there you go hey you can get

46:40.600 --> 46:45.720
married in ragnarok so if you're a real halo 3 fan that's

46:45.720 --> 46:50.280
what you're going to do right i guess i i don't know you know if

46:50.280 --> 46:55.560
you're a real halo 3 fan you're gonna play halo 3 i guess i know you're not

46:55.560 --> 46:57.720
you're not going to go out and do anything else just gonna play halo all

46:57.720 --> 46:59.880
day well speaking of which there is some

46:59.880 --> 47:06.040
download content that uh bungee has uh given us some information on

47:06.040 --> 47:11.240
well not us directly but they've just given it you know they give it up

47:11.240 --> 47:15.160
anyway um there are some uh maps that are going to be coming to the xbox live

47:15.160 --> 47:19.400
marketplace uh one of them is the ok corral

47:19.400 --> 47:25.800
which um is described as an asymmetrical medium-sized map so

47:25.800 --> 47:30.120
it's got so you can fight at high noon at the ork corral

47:30.120 --> 47:33.400
i guess so a little silly in your armor whatever

47:33.400 --> 47:38.280
and then there's a one called a purple rain spelled r-e-i-g-n

47:38.280 --> 47:45.240
and joe drallbank and then vandalay which is a simple map

47:45.240 --> 47:51.000
so anyway anyway you know what um when you say that map is

47:51.000 --> 47:54.920
called purple rain you know what that makes me think of

47:59.640 --> 48:04.680
yeah i think that was not a good movie no matter what anyone says

48:04.680 --> 48:08.040
prince is still awesome even if he's gone like crazy in the past five years

48:08.040 --> 48:13.000
now he's like suing his fans but how wait wait wait wait what he's

48:13.000 --> 48:15.720
like suing these websites that use pictures

48:15.720 --> 48:18.280
of him it's like his fan websites but they use pictures of him

48:18.280 --> 48:22.440
and like tattoos of of him and his symbols and stuff

48:22.440 --> 48:25.800
because he owns them but they're like fan sites why would you bite the hand

48:25.800 --> 48:28.200
that feeds you because you're crazy yeah because he's

48:28.200 --> 48:31.400
crazy but still he wrote purple rain and come on tell me

48:31.400 --> 48:35.800
you do not want to play halo with this as a custom soundtrack

48:35.800 --> 48:43.800
everybody purple rain no do not want

48:43.800 --> 48:48.040
i actually do like that failed uh let's see well what you might be able

48:48.040 --> 48:54.360
to be doing um pretty soon is chocolate rain

48:54.360 --> 48:59.880
h master osha says i guess better than chocolate rain have you heard the song

48:59.880 --> 49:03.160
i don't want to hear that yeah i've heard chocolate rain i actually saw the

49:03.160 --> 49:06.600
live performance of chocolate rain yeah i don't care there's a guy at my

49:06.600 --> 49:09.320
work that he was telling everybody about it and he started singing it in his

49:09.320 --> 49:12.680
cubicle and i thought it was the most hilarious freaking thing i'd ever heard

49:12.680 --> 49:16.440
and then that's how i heard about it act deaf says vampire rain

49:16.440 --> 49:21.560
no okay anyways the rain no what one game that has something that rains from

49:21.560 --> 49:24.040
the sky that's pretty cool which would be fire

49:24.040 --> 49:28.520
is boom boom rocket and yes they're adding a bunch of support for dance pads

49:28.520 --> 49:31.240
and guitars so you can actually play the game with

49:31.240 --> 49:33.960
those as well um other things that they're going to be

49:33.960 --> 49:37.400
fixing as well adding some japanese and korean language support

49:37.400 --> 49:42.200
uh tweaking the scoring system a little bit to focus only on accuracy

49:42.200 --> 49:45.880
and i guess there's a huge loud noise which

49:45.880 --> 49:49.640
popped up occasionally on endurance that they've fixed

49:49.640 --> 49:55.240
um some other fun things they uh have another problem with display

49:55.240 --> 49:59.400
updates when viewing through a vga cable

49:59.400 --> 50:03.400
um they've added some stuff the friends leaderboard now shows extra information

50:03.400 --> 50:08.360
such as grade and accuracy etc um multiplayer endurance mode

50:08.360 --> 50:12.360
fix for players color swapping sporadically

50:12.360 --> 50:16.440
and slightly bigger and better explosions

50:16.440 --> 50:21.000
you gotta love an update that adds bigger explosions

50:25.400 --> 50:28.440
oh tell me it's gonna have a chorus in here

50:28.440 --> 50:32.520
all i can find was a bad karaoke version of this song

50:34.440 --> 50:39.320
ah i was trying to do blame it on the rain this this sucks

50:39.320 --> 50:43.400
i ruined the show i'm sorry they didn't have the original milli vanilli version

50:43.400 --> 50:45.480
though on itunes go figure why wouldn't they sell that

50:45.480 --> 50:49.880
that's a classic i'm i see how they have a karaoke version i know they have a

50:49.880 --> 50:53.160
karaoke version which sucks obviously because nobody knew what the hell i was

50:53.160 --> 50:55.720
trying to play joke i don't know what you're doing

50:55.720 --> 51:01.000
you live radio oh my god marissa's in the chat room

51:01.000 --> 51:06.760
hi marissa ah i'm so happy let's move on when was the last time

51:06.760 --> 51:10.600
she was on the show most people was on the show a long time

51:10.600 --> 51:13.240
ago need to come back tell us some more of

51:13.240 --> 51:16.280
your stories marissa come back on the show okay and

51:16.280 --> 51:20.920
then do the russian lady uh bra story uh

51:20.920 --> 51:24.280
loki have you tried boom boom rocket with a guitar yet nope i might i just

51:24.280 --> 51:26.200
might have to try that that sounds like fun

51:26.200 --> 51:29.640
i saw the youtube edge though of the developers playing it pretty funny

51:29.640 --> 51:33.320
good times ddr might be interesting but i can only play that game if it was like

51:33.320 --> 51:36.840
actually set up like ddr how about ddr and the guitar at the same time

51:36.840 --> 51:42.440
omg name uh if you have not yet checked out two

51:42.440 --> 51:46.600
worlds because the very mixed reviews on it well there's now a demo available on

51:46.600 --> 51:49.960
the xbox live marketplace so you can check that out it's a demo of

51:49.960 --> 51:52.760
two worlds of course this is a game that's supposed to kind of

51:52.760 --> 51:55.640
cater to the fans of oblivion but it's supposed to be you know bigger better

51:55.640 --> 51:59.080
and better and it has multiplayer well their problem was saying it's the most

51:59.080 --> 52:03.560
ultimate like best rpg ever you know that that was a

52:03.560 --> 52:06.040
problem they shouldn't have marketed as the best

52:06.040 --> 52:10.120
game ever but unfortunately the game had some flaws but fear not

52:10.120 --> 52:14.120
uh south peak has said that they are currently making a patch

52:14.120 --> 52:17.080
and supposed to be out very soon for two worlds and it's going to address more

52:17.080 --> 52:20.760
than 50 different bugs and other issues in the game so

52:20.760 --> 52:24.280
awesome i'm glad that you released the game with 50 plus bugs in it

52:24.280 --> 52:28.520
way to go south peak shit what is wrong with these people

52:28.520 --> 52:33.240
oh look we found 50 bugs later on you know i could understand if we found

52:33.240 --> 52:38.360
two bugs or something like that but 50 come on that's just lazy

52:38.600 --> 52:42.600
good times not buggy enough we don't want it oh but don't worry

52:42.600 --> 52:45.640
the i'm sure the playstation 3 version will be coming out soon

52:45.640 --> 52:50.360
oh talk about bugs there well anyway how about something that's a little bit more

52:50.360 --> 52:53.320
cool for uh people with the ipod who want ipod

52:53.320 --> 52:59.240
games harmonix is giving us phase which is um pretty much a very low

52:59.240 --> 53:05.480
graphical given it's a ipod um version sort of of uh i guess it

53:05.480 --> 53:10.360
plays sort of like guitar hero is supposed to but it's

53:10.360 --> 53:14.680
tutor frequency yeah it's this they all are like the same freaking

53:14.680 --> 53:18.120
sort of game essentially in terms of their gameplay

53:18.120 --> 53:23.320
um but it's you your songs will interface with

53:23.320 --> 53:25.640
the stuff so i'm probably going to download it yeah that's cool because

53:25.640 --> 53:29.400
you can use your own songs with it on my iphone it's kind of fun can you play the

53:29.400 --> 53:33.480
games on your iphone i'm sure i can cool i thought you would need the wheel

53:33.480 --> 53:35.720
though to play but i guess yeah because you have the touch screen

53:35.720 --> 53:38.920
it might still work you i think you do need the wheel for that oh

53:38.920 --> 53:42.120
then crap give me some iphone games people

53:42.120 --> 53:45.560
i can play it on mine i haven't well i still have an ipod and dark tetsuya

53:45.560 --> 53:49.640
says you could play a dragon force on it heck yeah actually yeah the the phase

53:49.640 --> 53:52.520
kind of looks like frequency and amplitude and all that stuff but it has

53:52.520 --> 53:55.640
some zigzag stuff like it looks like you can drag back and forth

53:55.640 --> 53:59.080
which i imagine you know using the dial um you could do

53:59.080 --> 54:01.960
but that kind of came out of nowhere didn't it nobody knew this game was

54:01.960 --> 54:04.840
coming but kind of interesting because nobody's

54:04.840 --> 54:08.520
ever really taking ipod gaming that seriously because most of them have just

54:08.520 --> 54:12.440
been ports of like cell phone games but this is kind of a big step i think

54:12.440 --> 54:15.400
between this and some of the other recent releases they have been on the

54:15.400 --> 54:19.480
i like the stepped up music quiz games like 99 cents and some of the other

54:19.480 --> 54:25.240
stuff that's really taken off ipod might be a uh legitimate gaming platform

54:25.240 --> 54:29.480
we need i'm sorry i'm sorry what'd you just say

54:29.480 --> 54:34.520
ipod legitimate game platform we need we need iphone games

54:34.520 --> 54:38.600
official ones i do agree that they do need is not official

54:38.600 --> 54:41.240
true i don't want to brick my phone i mean because if you paid a couple

54:41.240 --> 54:44.440
hundred dollars for a fucking phone you better have something that plays games

54:44.440 --> 54:47.480
on it seriously but i do have the youtube

54:47.480 --> 54:51.560
channel and the youtube channel makes everything better

54:51.560 --> 54:55.000
give me a youtube channel and we that'd be cool anyways

54:55.000 --> 54:59.320
um so something that's kind of sad i guess for some people in the media

54:59.320 --> 55:03.480
would be that uh the npd group is going to be withholding their hardware sales

55:03.480 --> 55:07.880
numbers stuff from the media and so they won't know exactly what

55:07.880 --> 55:13.320
consoles are selling and stuff like that so sad oh wait

55:13.320 --> 55:17.480
that won't affect me at all so are you going to continue to report the numbers

55:17.480 --> 55:22.840
to us here on the show like yeah i will awesome so yeah so sad

55:22.840 --> 55:25.880
but no not that it really matters anyways because it's fucking console

55:25.880 --> 55:29.160
sale numbers i mean they'll have some stupid press release

55:29.160 --> 55:32.120
that each company will release you because you know sony nintendo and

55:32.120 --> 55:35.000
microsoft are not going to shut up about it and obviously they're going to you

55:35.000 --> 55:38.760
know release what their console sold so it's

55:38.760 --> 55:43.000
not like you know you're so left out about it but

55:43.000 --> 55:46.920
i'll be happy to report them all right well some numbers that maybe we can be

55:46.920 --> 55:49.160
reporting on soon are these new games that are

55:49.160 --> 55:51.640

to do with the um gundam universe yeah yeah well it's coming from bandai so

56:35.160 --> 56:37.160

59:27.000 --> 59:33.960
2008 but on the ps3 oh never mind yeah rayman raving rabbits

2 playstation 3 the orange box playstation 3

59:47.160 --> 59:50.760
warriors of the lost empire i'm guessing those are probably just all in the

59:50.760 --> 59:54.120
orange box and they probably just listen to separate as well

59:54.120 --> 59:57.240
well i think no i think that they actually are getting separate sales and

59:57.240 --> 59:59.640
then you get them bundled as the orange box

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.520
that's weird i don't know why they would do that

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.480
the only game in that whole pack i care about is portal

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:10.200

don't think it's coming out on the ds lies it is coming out soon though on the

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.480
we and ds well one thing that will not be coming

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.760
to your local target is manhunt 2 you might remember last week we were talking

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.920
about the uh rumors about the ban going on for target 2 because of the uh

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.880
hack remember we talked about that last week well a

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.720
official word has been put out from target about the official ban yes it is

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.120
true target will not be carrying manhunt 2

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.960
quote target strives to provide merchandise that will appeal to a wide

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.440
variety of guests we also want guests to be comfortable

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.520
with the purchasing decisions they make at target

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.720
all video games and computer software sold at target currently carry ratings

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.600
by the esrb from early childhood through mature

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.360
audiences while manhunt 2 was given a mature rating by the esrb

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.400
we received additional information that players can potentially view

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.400
previously filtered content by altering the game code as a result we've decided

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:55.720
not to carry the game because i'm sure the millions of people

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.600
that shop at target know how to do this to hack their psp to

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.440
unlock all the content i don't know about you guys i think

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.280
it's a little silly but i guess it's their choice people get

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.720
at other places apparently target doesn't like money

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.920
i guess not although then again how many people i mean is manhunt 2 really going

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.760
to be that big a big seller it's it's more

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.800
it's one of those games that's kind of all talk you know what i mean it is all

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.640
talk well still this and this news about a

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.680
manhunt 2 makes me very angry i don't know about you guys but i get very

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.320
angsty when i hear about this kind of censorship

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.720
and that means we need to do the fus of the week

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.720

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:30.360

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:33.880
won't get past it's just you know getting through it is a little bit of a

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.920
nephew that's all if you do drama in general

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:44.520

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.120
then well for uh people who've been keeping

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.880
up with the news on the max pain movie 20th century fox

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.960
has asked mark walberg to be in it and he said okay

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.160
at least that's what we're hearing so far

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.760
so um i think it would be cool with him in it i mean he's a good actor

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.000
better than his rap career he was pretty good in the party as an angry cop and

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.880
he's also good in the wee on the night as an angry cop so

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:17.240
he was great in this movie and in this movie where he plays an angry cop it

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.840
should work so yeah i think he's got the angry cop

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:26.040
roll down anyways um akira yamoko is actually working on a

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.400
brand new game series of course it's untitled yet

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:32.600
but uh glad to know that he's moving beyond

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:36.680
um silent hill at least i think he's moving on

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:40.760
beyond silent hill could be silent hill the musical maybe

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.240
that'd be awesome no but uh no idea what kind of game it is

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.720
what platform it is but he says that should be announced soon

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:54.600
so it's coming soon but if it's coming from akira yamoko like seriously how

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.720
can it be bad if you can't really be bad but yeah

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.960
i don't know i kind of feel left out with uh konami right now

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.640
you know no summer event that they did because they were moving offices and

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.280
stuff makes me sad all right

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:16.040
well we're just about to the end of our part a tonight

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.640
the first half of tonight's program we always like to close part a by

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.200
respecting our elders a little bit the way we do that

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.200
is by acknowledging the classic game of the week as selected by our the one and

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:30.200
only dark sakura so dark sakura is going to

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.480
dig through the archives and find a game that she thinks

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:38.120
you guys need to check out it's the classic game of the week

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.400
dark soccer what is this week's pick for the classic game of the week

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.360
i've brought this game up several times and it's just about damn time i said

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.320
something about it um today's game of the week is blazing

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.120
star for the neo geo very cool and we actually will play some

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:57.160
clips from blazing star i'm trying to get into some actual gameplay here

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.760
and the intro is all um you know rendered pretty and everything but the

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.560
game itself is um it's for the most part 2d with some

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:14.120
cg so it's pretty pretty sweet and um it's

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.440
basically like i think side schooling shooter um it's actually fairly

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.240
uh it's the sequel to polestar and polestar was a good game but blazing

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.400
star is just really really good and um it's actually

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:33.080
related to our type in its family but not quite you know what was that

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.120
fetus looking thing it turned into a star or something that

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.640
was weird it's weirdo storyline imagine star baby

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:48.600
i guess so anyway um it has a lot of you know uh

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:53.320
cut scenes and you know as you can hear a lot of talk wow this is like fun

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:58.040
oh my god this game is terrific log i'm gonna put this on a virtual console i

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.600
hope so i've never played it better well you know

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.600
what where i um i had actually played this um quite a bit when i lived in

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.760
alabama and i was very sad because the machine that i played it on was

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:13.240
actually broken into and the uh cartridge stolen out of it ouch it was

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:18.920
one of those multi avs machines um but anyway um

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.680
crust view lanes in sacramento they have this

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.920
they had it ah and they closed they closed down their arcade to put in the

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.800
pro shop dang but this is the boss coming yep

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.400
what is the boss here sure we're gonna listen to some music

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:40.920
boss music oh it's like a spider mech thing gross

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.440
oh you're you're timed on the bosses i noticed yeah you are turned on the

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.840
bosses and if you don't beat them within the

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.720
time limit you still progress but you don't get the points for beating the

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.040
boss huh that's kind of different very cool

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.720
and if i'm right i think it takes life wow

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:04.280
you beat it your skill is great that's the congratulatory you also um

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.720
collect um letters as you go through and it gives you more um

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:11.000
power ups and bonuses as you go through the game awesome um

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:17.000
but it is basically you have um a fire button and you have a bomb button

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.320
and you have charged attacks so it's very very very very cool

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:27.320
good times and people complain that blazing star was sort of you know dumb

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:32.120
down for its difficulty from pole star i disagree blazing star is still pretty

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.720
damn hard once you get past the first few stages

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.920
but it's just really i think that my favorite ship to play in

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.800
that game is the green one all right i don't know the graphics in

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.760
this game for some reason i don't know why it reminds me a little bit of un
