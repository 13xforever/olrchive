00:13.973 --> 00:18.635
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 11th, 2007, Manhunt 2 disappears from Target.

00:19.016 --> 00:21.797
[SPEAKER_01]: New patch lets you play Boom Boom Rocket with your guitar.

00:22.217 --> 00:25.539
[SPEAKER_01]: And can your PlayStation 3 warranty be voided by dust?

00:32.250 --> 00:33.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everybody out there on the internet.

00:33.651 --> 00:36.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.453 --> 00:42.818
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.198 --> 00:44.419
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:44.779 --> 00:47.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura.

00:48.041 --> 00:48.302
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

00:48.622 --> 00:49.462
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, DarkSakura?

00:50.103 --> 00:51.364
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been fed now.

00:51.864 --> 00:52.625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling a lot better.

00:52.785 --> 00:56.568
[SPEAKER_03]: You're full of burrito from one of our local joints, Aldebertos.

00:56.688 --> 00:58.469
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really supposed to be eating that.

00:58.489 --> 00:59.189
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this horchata?

00:59.530 --> 01:00.330
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Diet Coke.

01:00.350 --> 01:01.391
[SPEAKER_05]: I love horchata.

01:02.185 --> 01:07.289
[SPEAKER_05]: I love horchata too, however, because this is pretty much the only other thing I've eaten today.

01:07.309 --> 01:08.810
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured a burrito wouldn't kill me.

01:09.150 --> 01:11.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Horchatas probably are not very good for you because they taste like liquid churros.

01:12.313 --> 01:13.794
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, they're so good though.

01:15.235 --> 01:18.798
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who doesn't know what an horchata is, it's a sweet rice drink.

01:19.358 --> 01:19.979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicious.

01:20.059 --> 01:21.000
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like a churro.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got cinnamon in it.

01:22.381 --> 01:23.121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really delicious.

01:23.161 --> 01:23.662
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

01:24.342 --> 01:29.046
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only other thing I had today was a low carb tortilla with peanut butter on it.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.327
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wasn't hungry after that.

01:31.388 --> 01:31.808
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like...

01:32.358 --> 01:33.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I'm so not hungry.

01:33.479 --> 01:34.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Because peanut butter is awesome.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.982
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I started getting hungry, like, right before I had to leave the house.

01:37.442 --> 01:41.005
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like... And then I started getting sleepy, too, so I was... Caffeine and food.

01:41.306 --> 01:43.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go, turning into the food cast again.

01:43.067 --> 01:46.390
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it at the beginning of every episode of Orange Lounge Radio we're like the food cast?

01:46.410 --> 01:48.752
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I always bring in my dinner and you have to comment on it.

01:50.553 --> 01:52.255
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just... Well, I'm jealous because I'm hungry.

01:52.735 --> 01:55.878
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really eaten, so... I ate a little bit, but...

01:56.573 --> 01:57.513
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Belgian chocolate too.

01:57.553 --> 01:59.014
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make you some spaghetti, Rob.

01:59.594 --> 02:00.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have spaghetti?

02:00.375 --> 02:00.995
[SPEAKER_05]: Spaghetti.

02:01.495 --> 02:01.755
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:02.575 --> 02:05.937
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining us as well, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:06.217 --> 02:06.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

02:06.497 --> 02:07.858
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

02:08.078 --> 02:08.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing good.

02:09.058 --> 02:09.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

02:10.239 --> 02:11.739
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing over there on the PSP?

02:11.759 --> 02:18.842
[SPEAKER_03]: I was yelling at Loki just before the show to turn it down because I couldn't hear the regular stuff because I was being distracted by the PSP.

02:18.862 --> 02:19.843
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you playing on the PSP?

02:19.963 --> 02:20.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill Origins.

02:21.243 --> 02:21.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

02:21.783 --> 02:22.203
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times?

02:22.243 --> 02:22.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it fun?

02:22.744 --> 02:23.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty good.

02:23.985 --> 02:24.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

02:24.525 --> 02:29.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure we will hear more about that during the How Is Your Gaming Week, which is our first segment we always get into.

02:29.507 --> 02:31.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, no guests in the studio tonight.

02:31.168 --> 02:31.988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the three of us.

02:32.308 --> 02:34.549
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay because we always have our fourth guest.

02:35.349 --> 02:36.170
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we love the guests.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.090
[SPEAKER_03]: But many of them are having birthdays this week.

02:38.130 --> 02:39.331
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get to that in just a little bit.

02:40.191 --> 02:42.152
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, I want to introduce the ever-present.

02:43.061 --> 02:44.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Other guests on our program.

02:44.082 --> 02:45.322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all of you in our chat room.

02:45.402 --> 02:50.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com for those of you guys that join us live when we tape on Sunday nights.

02:50.445 --> 02:52.306
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand there's some new folks in chat tonight.

02:53.047 --> 02:58.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Joel Neer said he or she was new when they joined, so welcome, newbie.

02:59.270 --> 03:02.972
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure if we have any other newbies, but welcome to all the newbies in chat.

03:03.012 --> 03:03.913
[SPEAKER_03]: We like new people.

03:04.513 --> 03:05.894
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's start off with how was your gaming week?

03:06.334 --> 03:07.335
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, oh.

03:07.725 --> 03:10.567
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's mouth is full of burrito and is unable to... I don't talk with my mouth full.

03:10.927 --> 03:11.407
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

03:11.648 --> 03:12.448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you have manners.

03:13.069 --> 03:16.010
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a certain co-worker of mine does... Oh my god.

03:16.091 --> 03:17.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's getting to FUs.

03:17.852 --> 03:21.774
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, I was playing Cooking Mama.

03:23.255 --> 03:24.676
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Eating Mama.

03:25.837 --> 03:26.197
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.940
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, I actually did something other than Ragnarok.

03:31.281 --> 03:33.022
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I had to play a shitload of Ragnarok, but still.

03:34.262 --> 03:36.204
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a level from...

03:37.162 --> 03:43.464
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero, of course being uber noob, to I think 82 in three days.

03:43.744 --> 03:44.064
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

03:45.064 --> 03:45.444
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't matter.

03:46.765 --> 03:52.566
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I also played slash watched, I played a little watched a lot of Portal.

03:53.406 --> 03:59.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, and I've seen the ending, it's fucked up, and I love it.

03:59.708 --> 04:03.549
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dan's gonna rent it for me from his store, because

04:04.056 --> 04:07.438
[SPEAKER_05]: Good thing about being a manager at GameCrazy is that he can get me free rentals at Hollywood Video.

04:08.358 --> 04:09.919
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's just going to bring me home portal one day.

04:10.199 --> 04:12.980
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he was going to laugh at me when I got really motion sick.

04:13.061 --> 04:15.122
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, uh-uh, I'm going to stop every two levels.

04:16.702 --> 04:17.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a little breather.

04:17.403 --> 04:19.324
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it's like such a quick game.

04:19.464 --> 04:21.725
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, wow, this is three hours of...

04:22.950 --> 04:23.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

04:50.885 --> 04:52.326
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cake is a Lie

05:17.768 --> 05:21.370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, otherwise you have to get one that's too big and looks all dumpy.

05:22.011 --> 05:24.072
[SPEAKER_05]: But my friend, though, has the best t-shirt ever.

05:24.092 --> 05:25.273
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to share this with everybody.

05:25.713 --> 05:30.356
[SPEAKER_05]: She has a shirt with two 20-sided dye on it set to 20 and says, yes, they're natural.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.179
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

05:34.539 --> 05:36.701
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to see my friend Becky yesterday.

05:36.721 --> 05:43.285
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where I watched a whole bunch of Portal as we went over to a party that had cheesecake.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.007
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going around all day saying the cheesecake was a lie.

05:47.044 --> 05:49.366
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised no one's had a portal party yet.

05:50.366 --> 05:55.969
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to do is record the little music that's playing on the radio in there and just blast it on little radios.

05:56.390 --> 06:01.192
[SPEAKER_05]: A portal party, yay!

06:01.232 --> 06:05.335
[SPEAKER_05]: You could actually probably easily make one of the... That's what I'm going to do for my next cosplay.

06:07.793 --> 06:15.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think that cosplay for portal characters and stuff is going to be really popular, though?

06:16.179 --> 06:18.761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to carry one of those eyeball things around.

06:20.643 --> 06:22.324
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a weighted companion cube.

06:23.745 --> 06:26.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, you're invited to our portal party.

06:27.508 --> 06:29.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Dress up like your favorite character.

06:29.149 --> 06:30.150
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.471
[SPEAKER_05]: Let all two of them, or three.

06:33.052 --> 06:36.134
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only time you actually see your character is you happen to be looking through another portal.

06:37.608 --> 06:38.829
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:59.369 --> 07:01.289
[SPEAKER_05]: platforms on top to the other side.

07:01.669 --> 07:05.410
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and then shoot the other portal and go through it so that you got enough momentum.

07:05.930 --> 07:07.631
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got so freaking sick.

07:07.791 --> 07:09.211
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to leave the room, but that was about it.

07:09.231 --> 07:13.051
[SPEAKER_02]: You should try to get the achievement for the 30,000 foot drop or whatever.

07:13.452 --> 07:14.332
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make you sick.

07:15.632 --> 07:16.892
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to drop for six minutes.

07:16.992 --> 07:22.513
[SPEAKER_05]: This was on a laptop, so the resolution was so high that it really, really bugged me.

07:24.174 --> 07:24.894
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was very good.

07:25.814 --> 07:26.794
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything else for your gaming week?

07:27.708 --> 07:29.510
[SPEAKER_05]: I played World Cup Soccer in 1994.

07:30.150 --> 07:30.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinball?

07:30.891 --> 07:31.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Goal!

07:31.711 --> 07:32.152
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

07:32.772 --> 07:33.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:34.454 --> 07:37.236
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was pretty full, actually.

07:38.317 --> 07:40.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I did play Portal as well.

07:40.879 --> 07:41.840
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished as well.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.782
[SPEAKER_02]: I also finished all the advanced levels, so that was fun.

07:46.584 --> 07:50.167
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the little ball you get in one of those, too, that you have to carry it around.

07:50.427 --> 07:55.011
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a level where you have the companion cube, but when you're playing it on advanced, it's like a little ball that bounces.

07:56.031 --> 07:56.672
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know,

07:57.170 --> 07:57.990
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolls around stuff.

07:58.170 --> 07:58.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Not real fun.

08:01.032 --> 08:03.753
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to add that I love the automated weapons.

08:05.873 --> 08:06.173
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

08:06.594 --> 08:07.054
[SPEAKER_05]: What they say.

08:07.634 --> 08:08.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're cute.

08:09.135 --> 08:09.355
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.055
[SPEAKER_02]: Should have a trash can that does that.

08:11.075 --> 08:11.616
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

08:12.336 --> 08:12.676
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

08:12.996 --> 08:17.618
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, they should make an automated one like that that shoots like, um... What was it?

08:17.658 --> 08:19.919
[SPEAKER_02]: Those soft pellet things?

08:20.439 --> 08:20.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

08:20.979 --> 08:21.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Airsoft.

08:21.259 --> 08:21.859
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

08:22.200 --> 08:22.580
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Nerf.

08:23.740 --> 08:24.120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

08:24.560 --> 08:24.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyways.

08:25.721 --> 08:25.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

08:26.587 --> 08:27.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

08:27.268 --> 08:28.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things I played.

08:29.169 --> 08:30.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Galaxy.

08:32.072 --> 08:34.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Just flat out the best game for the Wii.

08:35.234 --> 08:36.455
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's it.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best Mario game I've played.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.099
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels very, very, very much like Mario 64.

08:41.800 --> 08:42.681
[SPEAKER_02]: Control's awesome.

08:42.761 --> 08:43.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks awesome.

08:44.202 --> 08:45.723
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta buy it if you own a Wii.

08:46.784 --> 08:49.186
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't own a Wii, you gotta buy a Wii so you can buy the game.

08:51.408 --> 08:55.071
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I played... What else did I play here?

08:55.623 --> 08:56.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Scenes Pro.

08:57.023 --> 08:57.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Play lots of that.

08:59.844 --> 09:02.265
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill Origins, started that a little bit.

09:02.465 --> 09:04.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks very, very good on PSP.

09:04.466 --> 09:05.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Very surprised.

09:05.667 --> 09:08.748
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke and fog looks amazing.

09:09.348 --> 09:10.248
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to be a great game.

09:10.428 --> 09:14.270
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the reviews have said people like this out of the entire series.

09:14.550 --> 09:15.370
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the best game.

09:16.991 --> 09:20.912
[SPEAKER_02]: Another game I've played that a lot of people are dying to get their hands on is Assassin's Creed.

09:21.618 --> 09:22.579
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost Squad on the Wii.

09:50.939 --> 09:54.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the weirdest, dumbest shooter ever, but you gotta buy it.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be like 30 bucks, comes out in a couple weeks.

09:56.784 --> 10:01.108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing the Japanese version, which is all in English anyways, but it is fun.

10:01.188 --> 10:08.415
[SPEAKER_02]: We've beat the game like three times today, and as you beat the game, you get like experience points, and you unlock new weapons that make the game harder.

10:08.595 --> 10:09.716
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly do you do in this game?

10:10.017 --> 10:11.057
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Time Crisis.

10:11.338 --> 10:12.719
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, shooting stuff.

10:13.565 --> 10:23.958
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, I mean, it's just so cheesy and stupid, though, but as you finish the game, you also unlock different levels, um, or the levels get harder, and they have different things that they add in there.

10:24.378 --> 10:31.126
[SPEAKER_02]: Works very well with the Wii Remote, um, great gun game, highly recommend it, I mean, especially if you're not looking to spend, like, you know,

10:32.220 --> 10:35.622
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 bucks on Resident Evil, Ghost Squad, definitely a good one to pick up.

10:36.382 --> 10:46.146
[SPEAKER_02]: It also does support the Wii Zapper, although I don't have a Wii Zapper, and as far as I can tell, it only uses the remotes, so I don't know why the hell you would use a Wii Zapper with this anyways.

10:46.847 --> 10:47.967
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can, I guess.

10:49.128 --> 10:51.609
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last game I played, which is

10:53.052 --> 10:53.952
[SPEAKER_02]: Really crappy.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.654
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game called Counterforce on the Wii.

10:56.954 --> 10:59.435
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not have heard of it, and that's probably a good thing.

10:59.915 --> 11:05.077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people compared to, I guess, Star Fox, but it's no way near Star Fox.

11:05.818 --> 11:09.199
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just a pile of shit, and you shouldn't play it.

11:09.499 --> 11:11.960
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel sorry for all the customers I sold that to.

11:12.000 --> 11:12.801
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it shit force?

11:13.361 --> 11:14.902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's crap.

11:15.482 --> 11:15.962
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap force.

11:17.383 --> 11:18.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it crap?

11:18.837 --> 11:19.717
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:39.881 --> 11:42.563
[SPEAKER_02]: and it says Counter Force and it has the company that made it.

11:42.663 --> 11:49.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's this period out in the middle of nowhere because they didn't format it right and so the period's kind of moved over to the next line or something.

11:50.169 --> 11:55.913
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's really cheap looking and it is a cheap game so, I don't know.

11:56.254 --> 12:06.722
[SPEAKER_02]: From the makers of such wonderful games as Ninja Bread Man, Anubis 2 and Billy the Wizard, Rocket Boomstick Racing.

12:06.862 --> 12:09.644
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we are not ripping off of Harry Potter even though we are.

12:10.387 --> 12:12.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost Squad is great, though.

12:40.057 --> 12:40.397
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

12:58.604 --> 13:01.366
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly the chat room has turned to talk about Ninja Bread Man.

13:01.386 --> 13:04.487
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Gerardimo in chat says, Ninja Bread Man, FTW.

13:05.088 --> 13:08.129
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 says, I gotta love those guys just for the name Ninja Bread Man.

13:08.509 --> 13:11.491
[SPEAKER_03]: And Actdeft dissents and says, Ninja Bread Man looks crappy.

13:14.793 --> 13:15.293
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

13:16.154 --> 13:17.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you played this week?

13:19.736 --> 13:22.937
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I did play one thing, but I don't really have much of an impression for it.

13:23.438 --> 13:24.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever Blue.

13:24.859 --> 13:25.219
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a...

13:26.420 --> 13:29.020
[SPEAKER_02]: underwater, I guess, scuba diving sim for the Wii.

13:29.200 --> 13:29.781
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty.

13:30.741 --> 13:32.421
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's sort of like Pokemon Snap.

13:32.541 --> 13:39.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the version I played was all in Japanese, and I'm trying to get my hands on an English copy, so I can actually understand what's going on.

13:39.802 --> 13:43.803
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can play your own MP3s on it, like Excite Truck, so that's kind of cool.

13:44.203 --> 13:53.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Except the MP3s I had in my card at the time were from Excite Truck, so it didn't really fit the underwater Enya that they have normal playing in the game.

13:53.825 --> 13:55.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, I have some, like,

13:56.097 --> 14:00.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock and Roll stuff, you know, like Paranoia something.

14:01.318 --> 14:01.658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

14:02.979 --> 14:03.339
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

14:03.639 --> 14:03.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

14:05.079 --> 14:05.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

14:05.379 --> 14:07.099
[SPEAKER_03]: So my gaming week then, if you're all finished.

14:07.179 --> 14:07.440
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

14:08.060 --> 14:08.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.300
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I play this week?

14:09.340 --> 14:10.900
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of World of Warcraft.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Also kind of got sucked back into Final Fantasy XI a little bit.

14:13.961 --> 14:14.541
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been leveling.

14:15.781 --> 14:16.081
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

14:16.922 --> 14:17.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jamie.

14:17.522 --> 14:18.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you want to say to that?

14:18.542 --> 14:18.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Rob.

14:19.332 --> 14:21.032
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I already gave you hell for it the other day.

14:48.439 --> 14:49.320
[SPEAKER_03]: That noise.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.981
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to play this game how I want.

14:51.021 --> 14:57.166
[SPEAKER_03]: So therefore, I am going to be a Corsair bard because I like to buff people and both those classes are all about buffing people.

14:57.506 --> 15:02.230
[SPEAKER_03]: Corsairs are awesome because they're based around gambling and bards are awesome because they sing.

15:02.330 --> 15:06.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, my character is a tacky Las Vegas nightclub act because I gamble and I sing.

15:07.314 --> 15:07.755
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

15:08.675 --> 15:12.078
[SPEAKER_05]: If I played that again, I would totally play a white mage monk.

15:13.119 --> 15:13.599
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.322
[SPEAKER_03]: See, we should just have a party of people playing whatever the hell they want.

15:16.342 --> 15:18.063
[SPEAKER_05]: But that makes sense though, a white mage and a monk.

15:21.035 --> 15:28.263
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says Rob likes to buff people very funny, jerk what are you laughing at?

15:28.923 --> 15:30.405
[SPEAKER_03]: you have an aim chatter with a comment?

15:30.565 --> 15:31.626
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't read it, what's it say?

15:31.846 --> 15:34.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob likes to buff people shut up let's see

15:37.826 --> 15:38.606
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a lot of that.

15:38.626 --> 15:44.249
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually took Corsair from level 10 to level 17 in just a matter of days, so that should tell you about how much I was playing.

15:44.669 --> 15:48.951
[SPEAKER_03]: I also was playing on the Nintendo Wii a little bit, because I was looking for the Check Me Out channel.

15:49.911 --> 15:52.052
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't there yet, but I did download Super Mario Bros.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.333
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, and I was playing a little bit of that, because that is a classic game.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.994
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what, when you play Super Mario Bros.

15:58.354 --> 16:02.516
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, if you're playing on a widescreen TV and you have it scrunched in...

16:03.424 --> 16:04.505
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:22.520 --> 16:23.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Bros. 3

16:44.119 --> 16:45.921
[SPEAKER_02]: The authentic Super Mario Bros.

16:46.081 --> 16:46.662
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Joel Neer in chat is asking, what about the new dancer job of Final Fantasy XI?

16:50.885 --> 16:52.307
[SPEAKER_03]: I am excited for the new jobs.

16:52.367 --> 16:53.668
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Scholar and Dancer look good.

16:53.768 --> 16:54.949
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope there's a third one.

16:55.309 --> 16:58.673
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see Geomancer or something, but I hear it's not going to happen.

16:58.693 --> 16:59.513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only going to be the two.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.177
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Shane, who you've probably heard on the show.

17:03.257 --> 17:03.537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

17:03.577 --> 17:04.578
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only the two.

17:04.658 --> 17:06.199
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to say it's only the two jobs.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dancer and what's the other one?

17:07.701 --> 17:08.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholar is the other one.

17:09.298 --> 17:10.238
[SPEAKER_03]: How the fuck's Scholar?

17:10.258 --> 17:12.159
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholar was, like, kind of obscure.

17:12.219 --> 17:14.300
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Scholar was... I'm smart!

17:14.380 --> 17:16.500
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not going to help you in fighting enemies.

17:16.860 --> 17:20.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholar is like a combination of White Mage and Black Mage, but they're not a Red Mage.

17:20.802 --> 17:23.683
[SPEAKER_03]: They use what's called, I think it's called Grimoire or something.

17:24.023 --> 17:35.867
[SPEAKER_03]: They use this to basically strengthen the White Magic and weaken the Black Magic if you use a White Scholar, or a White Grimoire, or there's the Black one that will strengthen the Black Magic and weaken the White Magic, and they have their own unique spells.

17:35.887 --> 17:37.007
[SPEAKER_03]: There's support for the support.

17:37.607 --> 17:37.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

17:37.988 --> 17:39.689
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor is they get the reflect spell.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.311
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have reflect, which is a spell that's missing from the game.

17:42.371 --> 17:44.873
[SPEAKER_05]: So then they're going to basically be like the...

17:47.059 --> 17:51.664
[SPEAKER_05]: for lack of a better description, like the ones that reflect the enemy.

17:52.084 --> 17:58.110
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, here's what it really is, is that the scholar artifact armor, which is like the endgame armor, is a school outfit.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.833
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you can actually be a Japanese schoolgirl in the game.

18:00.953 --> 18:05.037
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just go to the reality of why we're doing this job.

18:05.457 --> 18:07.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese schoolgirls everywhere.

18:07.279 --> 18:09.481
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm guessing that we're going to see lots of...

18:11.840 --> 18:12.961
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:35.760 --> 18:37.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough about Final Fantasy XI.

18:37.682 --> 18:39.404
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, what else have I played on?

18:39.525 --> 18:39.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox.

18:39.885 --> 18:40.766
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Guitar Hero.

18:40.806 --> 18:45.892
[SPEAKER_03]: We had people over here last night because the night started at John's Incredible Pizza, which is this chain.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.797
[SPEAKER_03]: I think mostly only exists in Central California, like Fresno, I think is where it started.

18:50.077 --> 18:51.318
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's up here in Roseville.

18:51.338 --> 18:51.859
[SPEAKER_03]: They have one.

18:52.319 --> 18:54.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Our show is based out of Sacramento, Roseville being a suburb.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.342
[SPEAKER_03]: I sometimes forget we have people all around that listen.

18:57.782 --> 19:01.845
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, we're at this John's Incredible Pizza, which is basically like a Dave and Buster's for kids.

19:01.865 --> 19:05.348
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a big pizza buffet, and then they have this game room.

19:05.368 --> 19:06.950
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have rides in the joint.

19:07.510 --> 19:11.974
[SPEAKER_03]: This place used to be a Sam's Club, and they totally converted it into this ginormous pizza place.

19:12.254 --> 19:14.355
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have video games, and we started the night playing.

19:14.395 --> 19:20.000
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing DDR Supernova, and my boyfriend William is so hilarious because while I was playing, this like,

19:20.779 --> 19:22.200
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:47.324 --> 19:47.644
[SPEAKER_03]: He's great.

19:48.225 --> 19:49.826
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these days I will let him come on the show.

19:50.146 --> 19:51.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be fantastic.

19:51.347 --> 19:52.088
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hilarious.

19:53.369 --> 19:55.150
[SPEAKER_05]: He was very funny at dinner, by the way.

19:55.230 --> 19:55.731
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the best.

19:55.771 --> 19:56.151
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the best.

19:56.211 --> 19:56.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're all in Central California.

19:59.634 --> 20:01.095
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to stop gushing so much.

20:01.155 --> 20:11.364
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, here's the other thing about John's Incredible Peach that I thought was hilarious is that pretty much outside of DDR and some random shooter games, it was all ticket games.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, gambling for kids basically, right?

20:14.106 --> 20:14.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

20:14.952 --> 20:15.872
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

20:38.025 --> 20:54.006
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy out your case or whatever like it's basically the show but with tickets I couldn't believe it I was like floored but then this place had rides in it like it had a roller coaster inside which I thought was crazy kind of a fun little place I'm sure they'll do well Gerardimo says deal or no deal is too expensive to play

20:54.973 --> 20:57.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, yay, gambling is good for you.

20:57.374 --> 20:59.055
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, jump in jackpot.

20:59.315 --> 21:02.636
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, this place had not one, but two jump in jackpot machines.

21:02.956 --> 21:09.858
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those in New York City that went when I was there and we had the OLR meetup, I got further in jumping jackpot than I ever have before.

21:09.898 --> 21:15.440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the machine was set to an easier difficulty, but I got all the way to like the O in jackpot, and then I lost.

21:15.480 --> 21:16.161
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so pissed.

21:17.121 --> 21:22.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, jump in jackpot is that jump rope game with the random Eurobeat music that sounds like Flamin' Finger.

21:23.820 --> 21:24.361
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:36.835 --> 21:37.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

21:37.115 --> 21:37.956
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cake is a Lie shirt?

21:38.056 --> 21:38.296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

21:38.636 --> 21:39.056
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

21:39.517 --> 21:44.119
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to say, oh yes, so since they were out of beer mugs, the idea was to come back to my place and drink.

21:44.159 --> 21:48.982
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody came over, those of us that went out, there's about seven of us that went out, and we came back here and we played Guitar Hero.

21:49.502 --> 21:50.883
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody was learning how to play.

21:50.943 --> 21:55.425
[SPEAKER_03]: William played for the first time, some other people I just met were playing for the first time, we were all having a good time.

21:55.806 --> 21:58.367
[SPEAKER_03]: So Guitar Hero, great party game, even though I only have one guitar.

21:59.309 --> 22:00.150
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been playing through that.

22:00.170 --> 22:06.819
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got some achievements for getting all the five stars on Medium, and now I'm finally working on hard and expert songs, and it's hard.

22:07.239 --> 22:10.604
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I could come over one day and bring one of my controllers.

22:10.644 --> 22:10.984
[SPEAKER_03]: You should.

22:11.184 --> 22:13.367
[SPEAKER_03]: We should rock out, do some co-op, be fun.

22:13.868 --> 22:15.029
[SPEAKER_05]: I want rock bands so much.

22:15.290 --> 22:16.191
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to say this.

22:17.079 --> 22:19.740
[SPEAKER_03]: That Dragonforce song is the fucking shit.

22:19.940 --> 22:21.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that song, seriously.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.780
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing I noticed about Dragonforce.

22:23.820 --> 22:27.201
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so into that song, even though playing it sucks.

22:27.961 --> 22:34.283
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so into that song, I went and looked them up on iTunes, and seriously, all of their songs sound exactly the same.

22:34.343 --> 22:36.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my friend has a CD of them.

22:37.323 --> 22:37.884
[SPEAKER_03]: They're awesome.

22:37.904 --> 22:44.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I'm going to look them up on the store real quick and play some of this for you guys.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how well it's going to run, though, because we have the webcam going, so it's kind of slow.

22:49.958 --> 22:53.842
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much all I wanted to say about my gaming week.

22:53.922 --> 22:56.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else want to add anything on their gaming weeks before we move on?

22:59.487 --> 23:00.348
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

23:00.708 --> 23:03.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's the song from Guitar Hero.

23:03.751 --> 23:04.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if this will actually play.

23:04.932 --> 23:05.693
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be too slow.

23:06.454 --> 23:07.795
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was trying to sync with my iPod, too.

23:11.723 --> 23:12.063
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock!

23:13.204 --> 23:26.329
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be a DDR song.

23:26.349 --> 23:30.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that sound like a song from hell for Guitar Hero?

23:30.411 --> 23:31.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's some of their other music.

23:32.052 --> 23:34.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a song called Operation Ground and Pound.

23:38.074 --> 23:38.554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's loading.

23:38.614 --> 23:39.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a moment.

23:39.615 --> 23:40.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the...

23:48.208 --> 23:49.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much sounds exactly the same, right?

23:50.049 --> 23:52.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Also would be a hellacious song to Guitar Hero.

23:54.752 --> 23:56.153
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally want to drive to this.

23:58.715 --> 24:01.717
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be my custom soundtrack to Burnout.

24:02.478 --> 24:03.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one more for you guys.

24:03.618 --> 24:04.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution Death Squad.

24:07.801 --> 24:08.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

24:09.262 --> 24:09.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

24:15.575 --> 24:17.076
[SPEAKER_05]: They really do sound the same.

24:21.219 --> 24:22.480
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make ringtones out of them.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.161
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

24:23.241 --> 24:27.824
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear, though, that the drummer is actually drumming that.

24:28.825 --> 24:29.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, that's so crazy.

24:29.905 --> 24:30.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Cry for Eternity.

24:30.986 --> 24:31.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

24:31.346 --> 24:31.667
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

24:31.887 --> 24:32.187
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

24:33.928 --> 24:34.909
[SPEAKER_03]: This band is awesome.

24:40.753 --> 24:41.374
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

24:45.370 --> 24:47.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least your drummer doesn't have to have any talent.

24:47.731 --> 24:48.592
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wait.

24:50.353 --> 24:52.875
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine what these concerts must be like?

24:54.376 --> 24:56.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, people die in mosh pits.

24:56.897 --> 24:57.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

24:58.578 --> 25:01.820
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be like a Death Clock concert.

25:02.461 --> 25:04.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Force is like one of my new favorite bands, seriously.

25:05.983 --> 25:09.385
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I will tell you why Guitar Hero 3 pisses me off, as well as Rock Band.

25:09.425 --> 25:10.866
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why these games piss me off?

25:11.606 --> 25:12.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Lack of journey.

25:13.547 --> 25:16.068
[SPEAKER_05]: AZHP says most relaxing game ever plus Dragon Force equals wins.

25:38.629 --> 25:40.150
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the perfect music for it.

25:40.170 --> 25:43.052
[SPEAKER_03]: You should put that in your little ocean exploring game.

25:47.935 --> 25:49.276
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be like a Katamari game.

25:50.017 --> 25:50.437
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

25:51.077 --> 25:55.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Carizzle says, I would be all over a Dragon Force downloadable content pack for Guitar Hero 3.

25:55.961 --> 25:59.923
[SPEAKER_03]: I refuse to pay the high prices, but I would just have to if they came out with a Dragon Force pack.

26:00.344 --> 26:01.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the Foo Fighters one.

26:01.665 --> 26:02.245
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

26:02.745 --> 26:03.326
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Foo Fighters.

26:03.346 --> 26:05.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, what we need to do is we need to do a video segment.

26:05.706 --> 26:08.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Crappy games that are made better through Dragon Force.

26:09.028 --> 26:10.129
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this idea.

26:10.389 --> 26:11.629
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this idea.

26:11.769 --> 26:13.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I fully support that thought.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Crappy games made better with the music of Dragon Force.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.253
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a brilliant idea.

26:17.373 --> 26:18.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent pending.

26:18.133 --> 26:20.634
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody better copy that shit because we're going to put it out there on the internet.

26:20.674 --> 26:22.335
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

26:22.355 --> 26:25.837
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be a crappy game we can make better with music from Dragon Force?

26:26.558 --> 26:28.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbie Island Princess.

26:30.569 --> 26:33.831
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I don't think that has custom soundtracks because it's not on the 360.

26:34.671 --> 26:38.674
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what game, because you can turn the... Viva Piñata Party Animals.

26:38.734 --> 26:38.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.555
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it has racing in it.

26:40.575 --> 26:41.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Fusion Frenzy.

26:42.076 --> 26:42.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusion Frenzy 2.

26:42.616 --> 26:45.218
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be game to give me back, though.

26:46.438 --> 26:46.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

26:47.919 --> 26:53.402
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that the last really awful game, because usually I wait to play a game until I'm sure I'm really going to like it.

26:54.923 --> 26:59.806
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember renting a game, though, one time from Blockbuster that was so bad, we went back and asked for our money back.

27:00.725 --> 27:03.187
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:31.411 --> 27:32.011
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna email them.

27:32.672 --> 27:33.132
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

27:33.372 --> 27:33.773
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

27:34.473 --> 27:35.454
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it doesn't hurt.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.995
[SPEAKER_05]: Find who their publicist is.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.296
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna laugh fast.

27:38.996 --> 27:40.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, chat room, chat room.

27:40.417 --> 27:44.980
[SPEAKER_05]: What we should try to do, and, you know, we were supposed to play Super Metroid back in the day.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.382
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Dragon Force to do the new theme for our show.

27:48.462 --> 27:49.083
[SPEAKER_03]: We should ask them.

27:49.103 --> 27:49.683
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be rad.

27:49.923 --> 27:50.304
[SPEAKER_05]: But, Rob.

27:50.964 --> 27:51.284
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

27:51.805 --> 27:53.065
[SPEAKER_05]: We should bring over Vibraban.

27:54.847 --> 27:55.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you okay?

27:55.867 --> 27:56.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't die.

27:57.128 --> 27:57.889
[SPEAKER_05]: And put it on Op 11.

27:57.969 --> 27:58.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

27:59.366 --> 28:00.827
[SPEAKER_03]: The Awesomeness of Dragon Force

28:13.059 --> 28:17.540
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, speaking of Guitar Hero, if you're playing Guitar Hero, join the Guitar Hero OL Army.

28:17.800 --> 28:22.101
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more information in our LiveJournal community, on our MySpace, also on the forums.

28:23.241 --> 28:26.382
[SPEAKER_03]: The Guitar Hero OL Army is still in the top 100, I'm proud to say.

28:26.742 --> 28:29.802
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you everybody who's joined and made it a success.

28:30.182 --> 28:35.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Richie Maniac is now at the top of our boards, by the way, and he has like over 2,500 groupies.

28:35.563 --> 28:39.564
[SPEAKER_03]: So he probably is playing Dragon Force over and over again to get that highest score, so...

28:40.148 --> 28:41.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Props to you, my friend.

28:41.450 --> 28:42.191
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have some.

28:42.552 --> 28:42.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

28:43.653 --> 28:51.044
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who's playing on the same server that I am for Ragnarok Online and playing on Deliverance Online, I'm making our guild tonight.

28:52.346 --> 28:52.607
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

28:52.787 --> 28:55.912
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the character to look for is Cecily.

28:56.943 --> 28:59.444
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but don't find me because I don't really want to.

28:59.804 --> 29:03.945
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're going to, and how can they get to your Ragnarok server if they want to join the Ragnarok OLR?

29:03.965 --> 29:05.625
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look for Deliverance Online.

29:06.625 --> 29:08.926
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do a search for it, it's going to be the first thing that comes up on Google.

29:09.346 --> 29:09.606
[SPEAKER_05]: Swell.

29:10.026 --> 29:15.767
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but that's the, my primary character that I will be making available for the OLR me.

29:15.927 --> 29:17.467
[SPEAKER_03]: You will post that in the forums too, right?

29:18.068 --> 29:18.548
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually.

29:18.928 --> 29:19.128
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

29:19.908 --> 29:20.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday.

29:21.168 --> 29:21.528
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon.

29:21.788 --> 29:24.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Guitar Hero, did anybody see this week's South Park?

29:25.442 --> 29:26.303
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't watch TV.

29:26.503 --> 29:29.464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a parody of Guitar Hero, and it was kind of funny.

29:29.504 --> 29:31.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it wasn't LOL funny, but it was, you know, haha.

29:32.546 --> 29:36.208
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a parody of rock superstardom, but with Guitar Hero.

29:36.508 --> 29:43.752
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what, the funniest part was the very end, when Stan and Kyle are finally reunited, and they are going to break a million points in Guitar Hero.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you'll get a kick out of this.

29:45.613 --> 29:47.614
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to do it!

29:47.634 --> 29:47.914
Yeah!

29:56.897 --> 29:57.457
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it!

29:57.817 --> 29:59.138
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my sweet Jesus!

30:00.018 --> 30:03.900
[SPEAKER_00]: You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach 1 million points!

30:04.480 --> 30:05.621
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations!

30:06.181 --> 30:13.324
[SPEAKER_00]: You are BAD!

30:17.165 --> 30:17.546
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

30:19.187 --> 30:23.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you'd think I would be offended or something, but seriously, that shit's hilarious.

30:23.369 --> 30:24.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was on the ground laughing.

30:24.989 --> 30:29.151
[SPEAKER_03]: But the funniest part was my roommate walked in, and he hadn't seen any of the episode.

30:29.171 --> 30:30.351
[SPEAKER_03]: He just saw, like, the very end.

30:30.611 --> 30:34.292
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he saw that, and he's watched me play Guitar Hero, like, tons throughout the day.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.233
[SPEAKER_03]: His jaw was just, like, on the ground.

30:36.273 --> 30:37.634
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't believe they just said that.

30:38.014 --> 30:38.594
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was funny.

30:38.954 --> 30:41.575
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally want an icon of their expressions in that picture.

30:43.896 --> 30:45.596
[SPEAKER_03]: You are fags.

30:46.557 --> 30:47.317
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

30:50.512 --> 30:55.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's get into tonight's... Oh, wait, really quickly, one more housekeeping thing.

30:55.234 --> 30:56.094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so horrible.

30:56.274 --> 30:59.776
[SPEAKER_03]: This week marks the fifth anniversary of Xbox Live.

30:59.836 --> 31:00.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you believe it?

31:00.476 --> 31:08.699
[SPEAKER_03]: November 15th is the day that Xbox Live turns five, which made me think this week, one, we're older than Xbox Live because we're five and a half years old.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.520
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, rock on.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.101
[SPEAKER_05]: We were here from the beginning.

31:12.221 --> 31:14.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock on for Xbox Live turning five this week.

31:14.842 --> 31:16.642
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing, like, all these types of contests.

31:16.943 --> 31:20.324
[SPEAKER_03]: And who knows what other kind of crap is going to be up on Xbox, like

31:20.714 --> 31:30.117
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, you know, retrospective stuff and maybe some new trailers and icons and backgrounds and I'm sure they're going to celebrate over there at Xbox.

31:30.557 --> 31:34.159
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why I say that is that Xbox Live is very good with the community.

31:34.539 --> 31:46.443
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, out of probably the big three, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Microsoft's very good with the community and I think, therefore, the community should support them for, you know, reaching out and caring about the independent scene.

31:46.743 --> 31:48.904
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hurrah to you guys at Xbox.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Xbox, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

31:51.679 --> 31:52.380
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, kick it off.

31:52.860 --> 31:55.820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so the fall update's coming.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.641
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might not be for fall.

31:58.461 --> 32:02.902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going to be hitting sometime in December.

32:03.762 --> 32:08.023
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that will be coming with it, of course, is the Xbox 360 Family Timer.

32:08.063 --> 32:13.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that is going to be something that your parents will be able to use to limit the time that kiddies get to play.

32:14.224 --> 32:18.685
[SPEAKER_02]: You can limit it down to like two hours, and then after those two hours are up, they have to play...

32:19.113 --> 32:23.778
[SPEAKER_02]: or wait 24 hours before they can play their Xbox 360 again.

32:24.198 --> 32:28.462
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an awesome idea that they're able to limit stuff like that play time.

32:31.145 --> 32:33.747
[SPEAKER_02]: No word though what else will be coming.

32:35.189 --> 32:36.170
[SPEAKER_02]: on that update as well.

32:36.250 --> 32:40.432
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, usually with those dashboard updates, there's a bit more stuff on there.

32:41.132 --> 32:46.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully some more video playback stuff so we can play some DivX maybe, Xvid, that would be nice.

32:46.775 --> 32:47.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

32:47.515 --> 32:51.877
[SPEAKER_03]: More high def stuff over the internet, not the internet, but the local network would be awesome.

32:52.718 --> 32:54.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I can watch my Dragon Force music videos.

32:55.619 --> 32:56.740
[SPEAKER_05]: They have music videos?

32:57.040 --> 32:58.280
[SPEAKER_03]: On iTunes, there's some for sale.

32:58.681 --> 32:59.901
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just as epic as you'd think.

32:59.921 --> 33:00.842
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just go to YouTube.

33:00.902 --> 33:01.242
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

33:02.540 --> 33:08.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week, if you're listening to last week's show, we were kind of joking probably more than we needed to about Kmart.

33:09.222 --> 33:10.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Kmart?

33:10.203 --> 33:17.045
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that came up, we were talking about is that one of the good things that Kmart is there for is that they tend to break street dates.

33:17.425 --> 33:19.445
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was totally proven this week.

33:19.766 --> 33:22.326
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to say, did we call it or did we call it on last week's show?

33:22.746 --> 33:27.488
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure enough, Kmart has been spotted with copies of Mass Effect.

33:28.489 --> 33:54.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Kmart sold a copy of Mass Effect, it looks like in Cropton, Maryland And they are so going to be in trouble tomorrow They're going to be busted, they're going to get the smackdown on that And I believe that was sold Friday or yesterday That's ten days before the official release date of the game And of course the guy bought it and promptly put a picture of it up on the internet with a receipt So you knew he wasn't full of crap So everybody's saying run and check Kmart and see if this is there Because you never know

33:54.700 --> 33:55.880
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not the only one, too.

33:55.940 --> 34:01.041
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another guy, too, off of the CheapAssGames forum, I believe, that got one as well.

34:01.822 --> 34:02.442
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

34:02.482 --> 34:06.022
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get your games early, Kmart's the place to go.

34:06.122 --> 34:10.843
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to check the local one, but I'm sure a lot of the local kids already beat me to it.

34:10.963 --> 34:11.704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no thanks.

34:11.844 --> 34:12.904
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go to Kmart.

34:13.084 --> 34:13.364
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

34:14.264 --> 34:15.164
[SPEAKER_03]: I can wait 10 days.

34:15.224 --> 34:16.625
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go there if I need socks.

34:17.485 --> 34:21.065
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say, though, Loki was showing off the lesbian scene.

34:22.006 --> 34:22.566
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hot.

34:22.586 --> 34:23.406
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very artistic.

34:24.031 --> 34:24.852
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hot.

34:25.052 --> 34:26.193
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you could respond.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Very artistically done.

34:27.474 --> 34:28.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it again.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.056
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it again.

34:29.296 --> 34:29.937
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go again.

34:29.977 --> 34:30.497
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.

34:30.597 --> 34:31.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's party.

34:31.979 --> 34:32.939
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's party.

34:34.921 --> 34:40.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there is a list of the download content available for Rock Band.

34:43.314 --> 34:46.295
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is actually a pretty good list.

34:47.455 --> 34:52.996
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got on here, there's a police pack with Roxanne, Synchronicity 2, Can't Stand Losing You.

34:53.136 --> 34:57.557
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Queens of Stone Age pack, a Metallica pack that's unannounced.

34:58.297 --> 35:03.018
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Sabbath, David Bowie, and I like that it's got Queen Bitch in it.

35:05.018 --> 35:07.519
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a punk pack that has ever fallen in love.

35:08.437 --> 35:12.298
[SPEAKER_05]: by the Buzzcocks, I Fought the Law by The Clash, and Rockaway Beach by the Ramones.

35:12.358 --> 35:13.558
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a classic there.

35:14.798 --> 35:22.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's some single songs, which is Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jukebox Hero by Foreigner, My Sharona, Cherry Bomb.

35:23.440 --> 35:24.360
[SPEAKER_05]: I like The Runaways.

35:24.720 --> 35:28.961
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have that album.

35:29.041 --> 35:32.121
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Joan Jett and Lita Ford.

35:33.121 --> 35:33.842
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

35:35.342 --> 35:36.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that's funny.

35:36.812 --> 35:38.613
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was going to say there's one that's on there.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Buddy Holly by Weezer.

35:40.494 --> 35:42.215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking forward to buying that.

35:42.675 --> 35:50.700
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually going to say there's one song in that, as much as I love Weezer, but there's one song in there that completely just makes me go ha ha.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.841
[SPEAKER_05]: My Iron Lung by Radiohead.

35:53.101 --> 35:54.182
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Radiohead.

35:54.202 --> 35:55.062
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiohead's pretty awesome.

35:55.482 --> 35:57.263
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Radiohead.

35:57.283 --> 35:58.984
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Creep is in the actual game as well.

35:59.485 --> 35:59.905
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

36:00.936 --> 36:02.017
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love Radiohead.

36:02.057 --> 36:06.019
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to point out there is still a distinct lack of Journey in this list.

36:06.179 --> 36:07.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, give it time.

36:07.419 --> 36:07.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it time.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.501
[SPEAKER_03]: I want my fucking Don't Stop Believin', dammit.

36:10.521 --> 36:11.502
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're the ones.

36:11.542 --> 36:13.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's Journey's fault that this stuff isn't there.

36:13.463 --> 36:16.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're like little bitches that don't want their fucking music to be in this game.

36:16.704 --> 36:17.305
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, fuck this.

36:17.325 --> 36:18.385
[SPEAKER_02]: We remember the Journey game.

36:18.445 --> 36:18.985
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked.

36:19.005 --> 36:20.406
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just not going to put our music in anything.

36:20.426 --> 36:21.147
[SPEAKER_04]: But Radiohead.

36:21.727 --> 36:22.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiohead is cool.

36:22.507 --> 36:23.088
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take that.

36:23.168 --> 36:23.728
[SPEAKER_04]: Radiohead.

36:24.542 --> 36:29.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I was still on the fence about Rock Band, and I'm like, I don't want to spend the $170 on the game.

36:30.486 --> 36:34.488
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I was watching some trailers online last night, and keep in mind, I was kind of drunk.

36:35.289 --> 36:43.254
[SPEAKER_03]: We drank a lot last night, and the people over here at Guitar Hero, and we were just all in here watching the Rock Band footage going, Oh, we need to get this game.

36:44.174 --> 36:45.175
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks so hot.

36:45.255 --> 36:45.956
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely getting it.

36:46.176 --> 36:47.056
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to have to get it, too.

36:47.076 --> 36:48.817
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife is going to buy it for me for Christmas.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.739
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already decided to get it.

36:51.519 --> 36:52.940
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like we're going to have our own little band.

36:53.624 --> 36:54.884
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully I'll have it early.

36:56.145 --> 36:56.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

36:58.426 --> 37:02.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 says, yes, my Iron Lung is my fave song of the bends.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.727
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so spectacular.

37:04.007 --> 37:05.068
[SPEAKER_05]: That is such a good song.

37:05.228 --> 37:09.949
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I have to say overall, my all-time favorite Radiohead song is High and Dry.

37:10.509 --> 37:11.950
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I was going to say, I want High and Dry.

37:12.350 --> 37:13.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't leave me.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.691
[SPEAKER_05]: But that wouldn't be so rock bandy.

37:16.911 --> 37:17.611
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

37:17.631 --> 37:18.152
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't work.

37:18.192 --> 37:19.052
[SPEAKER_05]: My Iron Lung is...

37:19.896 --> 37:22.017
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably one of the perfect ones to have in that.

37:22.277 --> 37:26.779
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mac Man in our chat room is urging me to hold on to that feelings, guy.

37:28.280 --> 37:28.560
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

37:28.820 --> 37:29.060
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

37:29.860 --> 37:32.342
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write Journey's fan club or something.

37:33.582 --> 37:34.963
[SPEAKER_05]: Know somebody who knows the band.

37:34.983 --> 37:35.563
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

37:35.703 --> 37:36.403
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep forgetting.

37:36.443 --> 37:38.584
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a friend who knows Journey.

37:38.664 --> 37:40.985
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me guitar picks from them.

37:41.005 --> 37:41.726
[SPEAKER_03]: We need this to happen.

37:41.766 --> 37:45.067
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, said friend, I need to have some words with Journey.

37:45.107 --> 37:45.767
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we make that happen?

37:46.268 --> 37:46.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

37:46.608 --> 37:47.808
[SPEAKER_03]: We should get them on the show.

37:48.529 --> 37:49.009
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

37:50.114 --> 37:50.634
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38:15.382 --> 38:16.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw these!

38:45.356 --> 38:50.599
[SPEAKER_02]: with, of course, the comment from EA saying that there's really not going to be a lot out there.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.841
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pretty good chance it's going to be hard to find.

38:54.181 --> 39:00.645
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the other side, my work side, I can definitely say that there's one hell of a shortage on

39:01.092 --> 39:02.974
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:21.081 --> 39:21.522
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

39:33.251 --> 39:33.711
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

39:53.181 --> 39:54.522
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are going to be readily available.

39:54.922 --> 39:58.523
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just getting the game with that new guitar is going to be hard to find.

39:58.623 --> 40:02.945
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't care about having the new guitar, because to be honest, it's a wireless big deal.

40:02.985 --> 40:04.545
[SPEAKER_02]: The wired one works just fine.

40:05.346 --> 40:10.788
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's the case, then get the game by itself, buy a guitar later.

40:11.368 --> 40:12.408
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the thing.

40:12.448 --> 40:12.909
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.

40:12.949 --> 40:14.189
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of these new instruments.

40:14.229 --> 40:19.671
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet you anything if they change the design of the guitar for Guitar Hero 4, we're going to be talking about this all over again.

40:20.472 --> 40:21.652
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why.

40:22.571 --> 40:24.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Well thank you for that report.

40:25.615 --> 40:30.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you have Guitar Hero 3, there's already some downloadable content available for it.

40:30.536 --> 40:33.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I mentioned earlier, I downloaded the Foo Fighters pack for the game.

40:33.917 --> 40:34.717
[SPEAKER_03]: That is up and running.

40:35.117 --> 40:39.558
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Foo Fighters pack has The Pretender, All My Life, and the classic This Is A Call.

40:39.578 --> 40:40.919
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like their very first single, I think.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know what it was sadly missing?

40:43.839 --> 40:47.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Was A, Everlong, but I think that song was in Guitar Hero 2, so I think that's why.

40:47.720 --> 40:48.961
[SPEAKER_03]: B, Big Me.

40:49.761 --> 40:50.561
[SPEAKER_03]: That song was awesome.

40:50.601 --> 40:52.022
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the Mentos in the video.

40:52.062 --> 40:52.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

40:52.882 --> 40:53.882
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when MTV played videos?

40:55.200 --> 40:57.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Velvet Revolver also has a pack of their own.

40:57.320 --> 41:06.222
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy it yet because I'm not as familiar with Velvet Revolver, but maybe... I hear they actually put trailers on Xbox Live of these packs so you could hear the songs beforehand, which is great.

41:06.542 --> 41:10.023
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a great way to kind of answer that demand of we want to hear this shit before we buy it.

41:10.323 --> 41:12.184
[SPEAKER_03]: So props to Microsoft for getting around that.

41:12.784 --> 41:21.025
[SPEAKER_03]: But Velvet Revolver, if you do want to buy that, if you're a fan of the band, because I do believe Velvet Revolver is the band that's made up of... Wasn't that Stone Temple Pilots plus the guy from Soundgarden?

41:21.145 --> 41:22.766
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe... No, Chris Cornell has...

41:24.645 --> 41:27.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm missing my groups.

41:27.550 --> 41:30.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I haven't been following my rock bands very well.

41:30.295 --> 41:32.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get yelled at by chat.

41:32.438 --> 41:36.164
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Chris Cornell had a different band, but I think it was somebody else that was in Soundgarden.

41:36.765 --> 41:37.266
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say.

41:37.507 --> 41:37.747
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

41:38.035 --> 41:40.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Velvet Revolver is members of Guns N' Roses and Scott Weiland.

42:07.433 --> 42:09.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, I had it the other way around or something.

42:10.315 --> 42:12.656
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell am I thinking of that had the guy from Soundgarden?

42:13.176 --> 42:13.576
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Cornell.

42:13.596 --> 42:14.197
[SPEAKER_05]: Audioslave.

42:14.237 --> 42:15.297
[SPEAKER_05]: Audioslave, that was it.

42:15.317 --> 42:15.617
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

42:16.438 --> 42:17.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was like, yeah, he has a different band.

42:18.679 --> 42:21.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Although... Anyway, sorry.

42:22.301 --> 42:22.661
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

42:25.122 --> 42:26.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I listen to pop music, all right?

42:26.683 --> 42:28.044
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention one thing real quick.

42:28.104 --> 42:29.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's Dragon Forge or Journey.

42:29.385 --> 42:31.106
[SPEAKER_02]: Since this story didn't make it into the...

42:32.367 --> 42:33.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Showroll, because it was too late.

42:34.268 --> 42:37.188
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii Guitar Hero 3, it only outputs in mono.

42:38.009 --> 42:39.689
[SPEAKER_02]: Go monophonic sound!

42:39.889 --> 42:40.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Nintendo!

42:40.750 --> 42:41.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

42:41.550 --> 42:42.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's probably Activision.

42:44.511 --> 42:45.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, mono!

42:48.112 --> 42:48.332
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

42:50.913 --> 43:01.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is something for anyone who is looking forward to playing Guitar Hero 3 on the PC, is the 360's wireless Les Paul controller will work on the PC.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.651
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43:33.468 --> 43:36.229
[SPEAKER_02]: Add the wireless gaming receiver with it.

43:36.389 --> 43:37.910
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well do the wired version.

43:38.770 --> 43:48.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the other thing, though... I've actually... When we were at Best Buy, I think it was, we actually saw a two-guitar pack for Guitar Hero 3.

43:48.875 --> 43:49.155
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

43:50.095 --> 43:55.918
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it would be pointless for them to not release the same kind of pack for PC as well.

43:57.238 --> 43:58.199
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really...

43:59.423 --> 44:03.385
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many USB guitars out there now with Guitar Hero.

44:03.625 --> 44:05.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Just find one that you want and then buy it.

44:06.486 --> 44:08.347
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Explorer controller was kind of ugly.

44:09.147 --> 44:12.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, they figure that you're buying all these games.

44:12.389 --> 44:13.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Your friends probably own some of the games.

44:13.749 --> 44:15.690
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to play two-player if your friend doesn't come over.

44:15.790 --> 44:16.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them bring their own guitar.

44:17.551 --> 44:19.452
[SPEAKER_02]: I heart the Explorer, by the way.

44:19.492 --> 44:20.392
[SPEAKER_02]: BYOG!

44:20.412 --> 44:24.654
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, the Les Paul is a lot more hot.

44:25.775 --> 44:25.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

44:26.499 --> 44:35.582
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of going back a couple months, but people might remember that there were some issues with the widescreen in the Xbox 360 version of Bioshock.

44:36.142 --> 44:43.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, 2K is going to be fixing these problems very soon with the next update that's going to be coming out, so all you people can stop bitching about it.

44:44.725 --> 44:52.628
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I think a lot of people have stopped bitching about it and moved on to other games like Halo 3 and games that are possibly coming out next week, so I don't know.

44:53.291 --> 44:53.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Viva Piñata

45:22.658 --> 45:26.059
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we've had, I think there was the story of the marriage proposal in World of Warcraft.

45:26.539 --> 45:30.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we have a story tonight about a Halo 3 marriage proposal.

45:30.880 --> 45:41.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was somebody using the forge, the map editor inside Halo 3 to lay down guns and swords in the shape of the words, marry me?

45:43.043 --> 45:43.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cute.

45:44.503 --> 45:45.083
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the answer?

45:45.884 --> 45:47.724
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming it was yes, but we don't know.

45:47.784 --> 45:49.244
[SPEAKER_03]: All we really know is the screenshot.

45:49.545 --> 45:51.265
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer was, boom, headshot.

45:52.786 --> 45:53.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

45:53.567 --> 45:55.327
[SPEAKER_03]: She said yes and then promptly shot him in the head.

45:55.588 --> 45:57.669
[SPEAKER_03]: And then proceeded to hump his corpse.

45:59.129 --> 45:59.810
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

46:00.550 --> 46:02.071
[SPEAKER_03]: Which might be like the honeymoon, who knows.

46:02.791 --> 46:03.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

46:03.692 --> 46:05.793
[SPEAKER_04]: La la la la la la la la la.

46:05.833 --> 46:12.556
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox user was Moviesign and he was proposing to his longtime girlfriend, Furtive Penguin.

46:15.217 --> 46:16.458
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Xbox Live names.

46:18.217 --> 46:18.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Sgt.

46:18.297 --> 46:18.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Sausage

46:47.951 --> 46:48.472
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

46:48.872 --> 46:49.233
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

46:50.034 --> 46:54.659
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're a real Halo 3 fan, you're going to play Halo 3, I guess.

46:55.019 --> 46:55.620
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

46:55.660 --> 46:56.941
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to go out and do anything else.

46:56.981 --> 46:57.963
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to play Halo all day.

46:58.063 --> 47:05.431
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of which, there is some download content that Bungie has given us some information on.

47:06.132 --> 47:08.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not us directly, but they've just given it.

47:08.614 --> 47:09.095
[SPEAKER_05]: They give it up.

47:11.327 --> 47:15.788
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there are some maps that are going to be coming to the Xbox Live Marketplace.

47:16.969 --> 47:26.133
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is the OK Corral, which is described as an asymmetrical, medium-sized map.

47:27.253 --> 47:29.434
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can fight at high noon at the OK Corral?

47:30.254 --> 47:30.774
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

47:30.794 --> 47:31.555
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little silly.

47:31.675 --> 47:32.895
[SPEAKER_05]: In your armor, whatever.

47:33.535 --> 47:39.658
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's one called Purple Rain, spelled R-E-I-G-N, and Jodrell Bank.

47:40.802 --> 47:43.803
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Vandelay, which is a simple map.

47:45.344 --> 47:48.886
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

47:48.946 --> 47:52.908
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, when you say that map is called Purple Rain, you know what that makes me think of?

47:58.110 --> 48:03.573
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was not a good movie, no matter what anyone says.

48:04.794 --> 48:09.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince is still awesome, even if he's gone crazy in the past five years and now he's suing his fans.

48:10.126 --> 48:11.407
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:11.788 --> 48:12.048
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

48:12.888 --> 48:16.111
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like suing these websites that use pictures of him.

48:16.151 --> 48:23.457
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like his fan websites, but they use pictures of him and like tattoos of him and his symbols and stuff because he owns them.

48:24.017 --> 48:25.058
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're like fan sites.

48:25.118 --> 48:26.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you bite the hand that feeds you?

48:26.820 --> 48:27.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're crazy.

48:27.560 --> 48:28.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because he's crazy.

48:29.202 --> 48:30.543
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, he wrote Purple Rain.

48:30.563 --> 48:33.905
[SPEAKER_03]: And come on, tell me you do not want to play Halo with this as a custom soundtrack.

48:36.988 --> 48:39.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, Purple Rain.

48:40.763 --> 48:40.963
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

48:41.684 --> 48:42.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not want.

48:43.945 --> 48:45.146
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually do like that song.

48:45.166 --> 48:45.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Failed.

48:46.627 --> 48:47.107
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

48:47.447 --> 48:49.789
[SPEAKER_02]: What you might be able to be doing pretty soon.

48:49.869 --> 48:52.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, Chocolate Rain.

48:53.671 --> 48:54.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolate Rain.

48:54.632 --> 48:58.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmasterosha in the chat says, I guess better than Chocolate Rain?

48:58.254 --> 48:59.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard the song?

49:00.055 --> 49:00.916
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear that song.

49:00.936 --> 49:02.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard Chocolate Rain.

49:02.537 --> 49:04.698
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually saw the live performance of Chocolate Rain.

49:05.319 --> 49:05.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't care.

49:05.880 --> 49:12.469
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a guy at my work who was telling everybody about it and he started singing it in his cubicle and I thought it was the most hilarious freaking thing I'd ever heard.

49:12.850 --> 49:13.751
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how I heard about it.

49:13.952 --> 49:15.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says Vampire Reign?

49:16.508 --> 49:19.590
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let the rain, no, what?

49:42.522 --> 49:49.245
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess there's a huge loud noise which popped up occasionally on Endurance that they've fixed.

49:50.145 --> 49:58.889
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other fun things, they have another problem with display updates when viewing through a VGA cable.

49:59.829 --> 50:05.571
[SPEAKER_02]: They've added some stuff, the Friends leaderboard now shows extra information such as grade and accuracy, etc.

50:06.772 --> 50:11.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiplayer Endurance mode fix for players color swapping sporadically

50:12.835 --> 50:15.357
[SPEAKER_02]: and slightly bigger and better explosions.

50:16.618 --> 50:19.020
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta love an update that adds bigger explosions.

50:25.565 --> 50:27.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, tell me it's gonna have a chorus in here.

50:28.627 --> 50:31.069
[SPEAKER_03]: All I could find was a bad karaoke version of this song.

50:31.209 --> 50:36.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I was trying to do Blame It on the Rain.

50:36.913 --> 50:38.374
[SPEAKER_03]: This sucks.

50:39.655 --> 50:40.356
[SPEAKER_03]: I ruined the show.

50:40.396 --> 50:40.836
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

50:41.854 --> 50:42.314
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:05.137 --> 51:05.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

51:05.978 --> 51:07.599
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time she was on the show?

51:07.739 --> 51:10.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa was on the show a long time ago.

51:11.002 --> 51:11.762
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to come back.

51:12.643 --> 51:13.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us some more of your stories.

51:14.224 --> 51:16.066
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa, come back on the show, okay?

51:16.266 --> 51:18.768
[SPEAKER_05]: And then do the Russian lady bra story.

51:21.110 --> 51:23.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, have you tried Boom Boom Rocket with a guitar yet?

51:23.472 --> 51:23.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

51:24.172 --> 51:25.153
[SPEAKER_03]: I just might have to try that.

51:25.173 --> 51:25.833
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

51:26.394 --> 51:28.556
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the YouTube-age, though, of the developers playing it.

51:28.576 --> 51:28.976
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty funny.

51:29.790 --> 51:30.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

51:30.431 --> 51:34.478
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR might be interesting, but I can only play that game if it was actually set up like DDR.

51:34.518 --> 51:36.581
[SPEAKER_03]: How about DDR and the guitar at the same time?

51:37.002 --> 51:37.422
[SPEAKER_03]: OMG.

51:38.164 --> 51:38.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame.

51:40.381 --> 51:49.187
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have not yet checked out Two Worlds because of the very mixed reviews on it, well, there is now a demo available on the Xbox Live Marketplace, so you can check that out.

51:49.247 --> 51:50.508
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a demo of Two Worlds.

51:50.768 --> 51:57.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is a game that's supposed to kind of cater to the fans of Oblivion, but it's supposed to be bigger, badder, and better, and it has multiplayer.

51:57.273 --> 52:02.496
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, their problem was saying it's the most ultimate, like, best RPG ever.

52:03.317 --> 52:04.097
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the problem.

52:04.257 --> 52:05.398
[SPEAKER_02]: They shouldn't have marketed it as...

52:05.796 --> 52:06.676
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:26.613 --> 52:28.414
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, what is wrong with these people?

52:28.734 --> 52:30.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, we found 50 bugs later on.

52:31.836 --> 52:36.378
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I could understand if we found two bugs or something like that, but 50, come on, that's just lazy.

52:38.740 --> 52:39.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

52:39.300 --> 52:41.041
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not buggy enough, we don't want it.

52:41.561 --> 52:42.322
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but don't worry.

52:42.962 --> 52:45.523
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the PlayStation 3 version will be coming out soon.

52:45.843 --> 52:47.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, talk about bugs there.

52:47.885 --> 52:53.828
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, how about something that's a little bit more cool for people with the iPod who want iPod games?

52:54.508 --> 52:55.869
[SPEAKER_05]: Harmonix is giving us

52:56.513 --> 53:08.644
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase, which is pretty much a very low graphical, given it's an iPod version, sort of, of, I guess it plays sort of like Guitar Hero is supposed to.

53:09.485 --> 53:17.632
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's... Yeah, it's this, they all are like the same freaking sort of game, essentially, in terms of their gameplay.

53:19.254 --> 53:22.457
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's you, your songs will interface with

53:23.639 --> 53:24.720
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:40.424 --> 53:41.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me some iPhone games, people!

53:42.285 --> 53:43.045
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play it on mine.

53:43.605 --> 53:44.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I still have an iPod.

53:45.006 --> 53:47.087
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkTetsuya says you can play a Dragon Force on it.

53:47.267 --> 53:47.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck yeah.

53:48.147 --> 53:53.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yeah, the phase kind of looks like frequency and amplitude and all that stuff, but it has some zigzag stuff.

53:53.770 --> 53:58.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it looks like you can drag back and forth, which I imagine, you know, using the dial, you could do.

53:59.312 --> 54:00.973
[SPEAKER_03]: But that kind of came out of nowhere, didn't it?

54:01.133 --> 54:02.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew this game was coming, but...

54:03.390 --> 54:04.010
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

54:34.611 --> 54:35.192
[SPEAKER_02]: Official ones.

54:35.212 --> 54:35.973
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do the Nintendo emulator.

54:36.013 --> 54:37.595
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree that they do need iPhone games.

54:37.635 --> 54:38.295
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not official.

54:38.716 --> 54:38.896
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

54:39.056 --> 54:40.198
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to brick my iPhone.

54:40.218 --> 54:44.703
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because if you paid a couple hundred dollars for a fucking phone, you better have something that plays games on it.

54:45.724 --> 54:46.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

54:46.304 --> 54:47.886
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do have the YouTube channel.

54:48.887 --> 54:50.629
[SPEAKER_05]: And the YouTube channel makes everything better.

54:51.690 --> 54:53.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a YouTube channel and Wii.

54:53.332 --> 54:53.853
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

54:54.434 --> 55:05.022
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so something that's kind of sad, I guess, for some people in the media would be that the NPD group is going to be withholding their hardware sales numbers from the media.

55:05.863 --> 55:09.886
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they won't know exactly what consoles they're selling and stuff like that.

55:10.586 --> 55:11.507
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad.

55:12.608 --> 55:12.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

55:13.468 --> 55:14.509
[SPEAKER_02]: That won't affect me at all.

55:15.930 --> 55:18.272
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you going to continue to report the numbers to us here on the show?

55:18.312 --> 55:19.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, I will.

55:19.553 --> 55:19.873
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

55:20.534 --> 55:21.454
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

55:22.035 --> 55:22.355
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad.

55:22.932 --> 55:26.593
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, not that it really matters anyways because it's fucking console sale numbers.

55:26.633 --> 55:30.414
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'll have some stupid press release that each company will release.

55:30.714 --> 55:33.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft are not going to shut up about it.

55:33.955 --> 55:37.595
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously they're going to release what their console sold.

55:37.715 --> 55:40.876
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like you're so left out about it.

55:41.036 --> 55:44.057
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll be happy to report them.

55:44.597 --> 55:45.057
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

55:45.317 --> 55:50.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some numbers that maybe we can be reporting on soon are these new games that are coming out from around the world.

55:50.398 --> 55:52.419
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start tonight with Japanese release dates.

55:53.058 --> 55:53.859
[SPEAKER_03]: Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles

56:09.810 --> 56:13.251
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there is that bundle that's coming with the gun with it, so that'd be cool.

56:13.291 --> 56:17.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavenly Sword makes its way to the Japanese stores November 15th as well.

56:18.113 --> 56:23.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out in Japan, Soku Kihei Votoms is coming out for the PlayStation 2.

56:23.934 --> 56:24.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, that's cool.

56:24.714 --> 56:26.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like another MechWarrior game.

56:26.735 --> 56:28.116
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's fairly old school.

56:28.356 --> 56:32.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Votoms, I believe, has something to do with the Gundam universe.

56:32.717 --> 56:32.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

56:32.897 --> 56:33.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

56:33.806 --> 56:36.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, it's coming from Bandai, so that would make sense.

56:36.227 --> 56:38.427
[SPEAKER_02]: Big surprise!

56:38.487 --> 56:45.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out also on the PlayStation 2 is a game called Hayatakami 2 is coming out.

56:45.149 --> 56:47.029
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks like a survival horror-ish game to me.

56:47.049 --> 56:51.911
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks very Silent Hill from the cover, but this isn't something I don't think we have over here.

56:52.411 --> 56:53.211
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it.

56:53.752 --> 56:54.673
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Cooking Mama 2, Taito

57:15.555 --> 57:16.576
[SPEAKER_03]: A Peanuts game!

57:16.916 --> 57:17.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the Peanuts?

57:17.577 --> 57:19.238
[SPEAKER_05]: Peanuts is still very, kind of big.

57:19.458 --> 57:21.780
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like been a sort of trendy thing lately.

57:22.101 --> 57:23.442
[SPEAKER_03]: And the games don't stop coming.

57:23.662 --> 57:27.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoopy to isho no ni DS, I go lesson.

57:27.805 --> 57:31.108
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like some type of training game for the DS using the Snoopy characters.

57:31.128 --> 57:32.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoopy and us together.

57:33.050 --> 57:35.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like some type of like training game.

57:35.192 --> 57:36.893
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Snoopy and us together English lesson.

57:37.654 --> 57:38.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh fun.

57:38.074 --> 57:38.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

57:38.855 --> 57:39.055
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

57:39.990 --> 57:45.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out, this will be the last game for Japan on November 15th, another version of Dungeon Explorer.

57:46.233 --> 57:51.996
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the PSP, and I've got to say, the box arts are very different, so I'm wondering if the games aren't pretty different as well.

57:52.536 --> 57:55.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Two completely different versions of Dungeon Explorer.

57:56.158 --> 57:57.419
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it, Japanese release dates.

57:57.879 --> 58:03.902
[SPEAKER_05]: Our UK release dates, on the 13th we have Evercrack 2, Rise of Karnak, or sorry, Kunark.

58:04.202 --> 58:04.943
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did I say Karnak?

58:04.963 --> 58:05.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Kunark!

58:06.648 --> 58:08.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't Karnak Johnny Carson's character?

58:08.749 --> 58:14.251
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's... I'm thinking... Ah, forget it.

58:15.011 --> 58:15.251
[SPEAKER_05]: Egypt.

58:15.471 --> 58:15.691

59:54.213 --> 59:59.694

59:59.714 --> 01:00:00.194

01:04:14.293 --> 01:04:16.233
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad we took time out in the show to acknowledge.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.574
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that game is awesome.

01:04:17.714 --> 01:04:19.355

01:05:37.907 --> 01:05:41.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Game release-wise, so I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.

[SPEAKER_03]: Target strives to provide merchandise that will appeal to a wide variety of guests.

01:06:31.192 --> 01:06:34.333
[SPEAKER_03]: We also want guests to be comfortable with the purchasing decisions they make at Target.

01:06:34.734 --> 01:06:41.237
[SPEAKER_03]: All video games and computer software sold at Target currently carry ratings by the ESRB from early childhood through mature audiences.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:49.942
[SPEAKER_03]: While Manhunt 2 was given a mature rating by the ESRB, we received additional information that players can potentially view previously filtered content by altering the game code.

01:06:50.322 --> 01:06:52.303
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result, we have decided not to carry the game.

01:06:53.214 --> 01:06:59.597
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm sure the millions of people that shop at Target know how to do this to hack their PSP to unlock all the content.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:02.318
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys.

01:07:02.338 --> 01:07:03.199
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a little silly.

01:07:03.659 --> 01:07:05.420
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it's their choice.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:07.001
[SPEAKER_03]: People just get it other places.

01:07:07.161 --> 01:07:08.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Target doesn't like money.

01:07:09.882 --> 01:07:10.342
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess not.

01:07:10.502 --> 01:07:11.023
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad.

01:07:11.443 --> 01:07:14.164
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is Manhunt 2 really going to be that big a big seller?

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those games that's kind of all talk.

01:07:16.485 --> 01:07:16.906
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

01:07:17.486 --> 01:07:18.166
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all talk.

01:07:19.487 --> 01:07:19.667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:07:19.929 --> 01:07:23.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, still, this news about Manhunt 2 makes me very angry.

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:27.071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys, but I get very angsty when I hear about this kind of censorship.

01:07:27.471 --> 01:07:29.772
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means we need to do the FUs of the week.

01:07:40.455 --> 01:07:42.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, do you have any FUs you'd like to share with us?

01:07:43.255 --> 01:07:44.476
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Mr. Annoying.

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:46.957
[SPEAKER_05]: My co-worker.

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:48.257
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

01:07:49.241 --> 01:07:52.222
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go to work, I do not want to hear the word of God!

01:07:54.543 --> 01:08:02.485
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to hear, oh, my productivity sucks, and then see you get up from your desk 50,000 times a day and not do your crap.

01:08:02.505 --> 01:08:07.466
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired of you bitching like a menopausal woman.

01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:10.127
[SPEAKER_05]: Just shut up.

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.808
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for helping me with my work.

01:08:13.628 --> 01:08:17.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, if you're not having more time during the day to play games,

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:19.599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.320
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU goes to work drama.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I don't think things have been going that bad.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:31.021
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, you know, I still love my job and what I do day time, but there was a little bit of drama this past week, but it's nothing we'll get past.

01:08:31.201 --> 01:08:34.302
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, getting through it is a little bit of an FU.

01:08:36.262 --> 01:08:36.582
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:38.203
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to drama in general.

01:08:39.023 --> 01:08:40.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't want no drama.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:40.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not want.

01:08:42.584 --> 01:08:44.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on with this week's gaming news then.

01:08:45.856 --> 01:09:05.981
[SPEAKER_05]: well for uh people who've been keeping up with the news on the Max Payne movie 20th Century Fox has asked Mark Wahlberg to be in it and he said okay at least that's what we're hearing so far so um I think it'll be cool with him in it I mean he's a good actor better than his rap career

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:11.725
[SPEAKER_02]: He was pretty good in The Departed as an angry cop, and he's also good in The Wii on the night as an angry cop.

01:09:11.785 --> 01:09:13.785
[SPEAKER_02]: He was great in Boogie Nights.

01:09:14.846 --> 01:09:17.726
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this movie where he plays an angry cop, it should work.

01:09:18.246 --> 01:09:21.307
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think he's got the angry cop roll down.

01:09:22.447 --> 01:09:27.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Akira Yamaoka is actually working on a brand new game series.

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:33.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's untitled yet, but glad to know that he's moving beyond Silent Hill.

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:35.150
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I

01:09:35.623 --> 01:09:37.723
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's moving on beyond Silent Hill.

01:09:38.384 --> 01:09:39.944
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be Silent Hill the Musical, maybe.

01:09:40.884 --> 01:09:41.744
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

01:09:42.364 --> 01:09:48.546
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but no idea what kind of game it is, what platform it is, but he says it should be announced soon.

01:09:49.906 --> 01:09:51.446
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's coming soon.

01:09:51.886 --> 01:09:52.147
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon.

01:09:52.167 --> 01:09:55.247
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's coming from Akira Yamaoka, like seriously, how can it be bad?

01:09:55.267 --> 01:09:56.447
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

01:09:56.467 --> 01:09:57.348
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't really be bad.

01:09:57.448 --> 01:10:00.288
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I don't know.

01:10:01.028 --> 01:10:03.489
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel left out with Konami right now.

01:10:04.138 --> 01:10:04.919
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:34.707
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys need to check out.

01:10:34.827 --> 01:10:35.847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the classic game of the week.

01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:41.111
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what is this week's pick for the classic game of the week?

01:10:41.591 --> 01:10:45.153
[SPEAKER_05]: I've brought this game up several times, and it's just about damn time I said something about it.

01:10:45.713 --> 01:10:49.015
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's game of the week is Blazing Star for the Neo Geo.

01:10:50.316 --> 01:10:50.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

01:10:50.936 --> 01:10:53.538
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually will play some clips from Blazing Star.

01:10:53.578 --> 01:10:55.259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get into some actual gameplay here.

01:10:55.519 --> 01:10:56.880
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the intro song is good.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:57.921
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to do the intro?

01:10:57.961 --> 01:10:58.501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why not?

01:11:01.078 --> 01:11:04.600
[SPEAKER_05]: And the intro is all, you know, rendered and pretty and everything.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:10.123
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game itself is, it's for the most part 2D with some CG.

01:11:10.243 --> 01:11:11.724
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty, pretty sweet.

01:11:12.404 --> 01:11:16.146
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically, like I was saying, a side-scrolling shooter.

01:11:17.287 --> 01:11:20.869
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually fairly, it's the sequel to Polestar.

01:11:21.249 --> 01:11:25.111
[SPEAKER_05]: And Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star is just really, really good.

01:11:25.892 --> 01:11:29.994
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually related to R-Type in it.

01:11:30.598 --> 01:11:32.098
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:11:56.345 --> 01:11:58.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to put this on a virtual console?

01:11:58.066 --> 01:11:58.547
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

01:11:58.807 --> 01:11:59.367
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never played this.

01:11:59.387 --> 01:11:59.747
[SPEAKER_03]: They better.

01:12:00.068 --> 01:12:11.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I had actually played this quite a bit when I lived in Alabama, and I was very sad because the machine that I played it on was actually broken into, and the cartridge stole it out of it.

01:12:12.376 --> 01:12:12.557
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

01:12:13.097 --> 01:12:15.819
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of those multi-AVS machines.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.142
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, Crestview Lanes.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:21.570
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:45.731
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're timed on the bosses, I noticed.

01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:46.951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you are timed on the bosses.

01:12:47.411 --> 01:12:52.113
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't beat them within the time limit, you still progress, but you don't get the points for beating the boss.

01:12:52.473 --> 01:12:52.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

01:12:53.373 --> 01:12:54.054
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of different.

01:12:55.374 --> 01:12:55.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

01:12:56.274 --> 01:12:57.615
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm right, I think it takes life.

01:12:58.635 --> 01:12:58.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:12:59.895 --> 01:13:00.416
[SPEAKER_03]: You beat it.

01:13:00.456 --> 01:13:01.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Your skill is great.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:03.746
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the congratulatory message.

01:13:03.786 --> 01:13:09.649
[SPEAKER_05]: You also collect letters as you go through and it gives you more power-ups and bonuses as you go through the game.

01:13:09.949 --> 01:13:10.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:16.993
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is basically, you have a fire button and you have a bomb button.

01:13:17.213 --> 01:13:18.273
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have charged attacks.

01:13:20.074 --> 01:13:22.896
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very, very, very, very cool.

01:13:23.436 --> 01:13:24.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

01:13:24.397 --> 01:13:28.999
[SPEAKER_05]: And people complained that Blazing Star was sort of, you know, dumbed down for its difficulty from Polestar.

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:30.240
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:41.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Blazing Star is still pretty damn hard once you get past the first few stages, but it's just really... I think that my favorite ship to play in that game is the Green one.

01:13:43.925 --> 01:13:44.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:13:44.905 --> 01:13:51.309
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the graphics in this game, for some reason, I don't know why, it reminds me a little bit of UN Squadron, just the art style, for some reason.

01:13:52.208 --> 01:13:52.889
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

01:14:19.036 --> 01:14:27.847
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going to bring us to a close here for Part A of our podcast, but fear not, because we tape for several hours every Sunday night, and Part B will be on its way.

01:14:27.887 --> 01:14:33.034
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys listening on the podcast feed, we'll see you in a couple days here with Orange Launch Radio Part B. Stay tuned.
