1
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:18,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 11th, 2007, Manhunt 2 disappears from Target.

2
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:21,797
[SPEAKER_01]: New patch lets you play Boom Boom Rocket with your guitar.

3
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:25,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And can your PlayStation 3 warranty be voided by dust?

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everybody out there on the internet.

5
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:36,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:42,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,419
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:47,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura.

9
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:48,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

10
00:00:48,622 --> 00:00:49,462
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, DarkSakura?

11
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:51,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been fed now.

12
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:52,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling a lot better.

13
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:56,568
[SPEAKER_03]: You're full of burrito from one of our local joints, Aldebertos.

14
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:58,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really supposed to be eating that.

15
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this horchata?

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,330
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Diet Coke.

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I love horchata.

18
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:07,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I love horchata too, however, because this is pretty much the only other thing I've eaten today.

19
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured a burrito wouldn't kill me.

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Horchatas probably are not very good for you because they taste like liquid churros.

21
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:13,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, they're so good though.

22
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:18,798
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who doesn't know what an horchata is, it's a sweet rice drink.

23
00:01:19,358 --> 00:01:19,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's delicious.

24
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,000
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes like a churro.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got cinnamon in it.

26
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really delicious.

27
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:23,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

28
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:29,046
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only other thing I had today was a low carb tortilla with peanut butter on it.

29
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wasn't hungry after that.

30
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:31,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like...

31
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, I'm so not hungry.

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Because peanut butter is awesome.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I started getting hungry, like, right before I had to leave the house.

34
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:41,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like... And then I started getting sleepy, too, so I was... Caffeine and food.

35
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go, turning into the food cast again.

36
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it at the beginning of every episode of Orange Lounge Radio we're like the food cast?

37
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I always bring in my dinner and you have to comment on it.

38
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:52,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just... Well, I'm jealous because I'm hungry.

39
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:55,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really eaten, so... I ate a little bit, but...

40
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:57,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Belgian chocolate too.

41
00:01:57,553 --> 00:01:59,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to make you some spaghetti, Rob.

42
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:00,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have spaghetti?

43
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:00,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Spaghetti.

44
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:01,755
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

45
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:05,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining us as well, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

46
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:06,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

47
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:07,858
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

48
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:08,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing good.

49
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:09,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

50
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,739
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing over there on the PSP?

51
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:18,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I was yelling at Loki just before the show to turn it down because I couldn't hear the regular stuff because I was being distracted by the PSP.

52
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:19,843
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you playing on the PSP?

53
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:20,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill Origins.

54
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:21,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

55
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times?

56
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:22,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it fun?

57
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:23,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty good.

58
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:24,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

59
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:29,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure we will hear more about that during the How Is Your Gaming Week, which is our first segment we always get into.

60
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:31,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, no guests in the studio tonight.

61
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:31,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the three of us.

62
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,549
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay because we always have our fourth guest.

63
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,170
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we love the guests.

64
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,090
[SPEAKER_03]: But many of them are having birthdays this week.

65
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get to that in just a little bit.

66
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,152
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, I want to introduce the ever-present.

67
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Other guests on our program.

68
00:02:44,082 --> 00:02:45,322
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all of you in our chat room.

69
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:50,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com for those of you guys that join us live when we tape on Sunday nights.

70
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:52,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand there's some new folks in chat tonight.

71
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:58,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Joel Neer said he or she was new when they joined, so welcome, newbie.

72
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure if we have any other newbies, but welcome to all the newbies in chat.

73
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: We like new people.

74
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:05,894
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's start off with how was your gaming week?

75
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:07,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, oh.

76
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,567
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's mouth is full of burrito and is unable to... I don't talk with my mouth full.

77
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:11,407
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

78
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:12,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you have manners.

79
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a certain co-worker of mine does... Oh my god.

80
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:17,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's getting to FUs.

81
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:21,774
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, I was playing Cooking Mama.

82
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:24,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm playing Eating Mama.

83
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:26,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

84
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,940
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, I actually did something other than Ragnarok.

85
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:33,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I had to play a shitload of Ragnarok, but still.

86
00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:36,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a level from...

87
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:43,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero, of course being uber noob, to I think 82 in three days.

88
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerd.

89
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:45,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't matter.

90
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:52,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I also played slash watched, I played a little watched a lot of Portal.

91
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:59,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, and I've seen the ending, it's fucked up, and I love it.

92
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:03,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dan's gonna rent it for me from his store, because

93
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:07,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Good thing about being a manager at GameCrazy is that he can get me free rentals at Hollywood Video.

94
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:09,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's just going to bring me home portal one day.

95
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he was going to laugh at me when I got really motion sick.

96
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, uh-uh, I'm going to stop every two levels.

97
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:17,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a little breather.

98
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it's like such a quick game.

99
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:21,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, wow, this is three hours of...

100
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

101
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cake is a Lie

102
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:21,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, otherwise you have to get one that's too big and looks all dumpy.

103
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,072
[SPEAKER_05]: But my friend, though, has the best t-shirt ever.

104
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to share this with everybody.

105
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:30,356
[SPEAKER_05]: She has a shirt with two 20-sided dye on it set to 20 and says, yes, they're natural.

106
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

107
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to see my friend Becky yesterday.

108
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:43,285
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where I watched a whole bunch of Portal as we went over to a party that had cheesecake.

109
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was going around all day saying the cheesecake was a lie.

110
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:49,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised no one's had a portal party yet.

111
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:55,969
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to do is record the little music that's playing on the radio in there and just blast it on little radios.

112
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,192
[SPEAKER_05]: A portal party, yay!

113
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:05,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You could actually probably easily make one of the... That's what I'm going to do for my next cosplay.

114
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:15,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think that cosplay for portal characters and stuff is going to be really popular, though?

115
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to carry one of those eyeball things around.

116
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:22,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a weighted companion cube.

117
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:26,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, you're invited to our portal party.

118
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Dress up like your favorite character.

119
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,150
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

120
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Let all two of them, or three.

121
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:36,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only time you actually see your character is you happen to be looking through another portal.

122
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:38,829
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

123
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:01,289
[SPEAKER_05]: platforms on top to the other side.

124
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and then shoot the other portal and go through it so that you got enough momentum.

125
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got so freaking sick.

126
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to leave the room, but that was about it.

127
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,051
[SPEAKER_02]: You should try to get the achievement for the 30,000 foot drop or whatever.

128
00:07:13,452 --> 00:07:14,332
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll make you sick.

129
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:16,892
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to drop for six minutes.

130
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:22,513
[SPEAKER_05]: This was on a laptop, so the resolution was so high that it really, really bugged me.

131
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:24,894
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was very good.

132
00:07:25,814 --> 00:07:26,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything else for your gaming week?

133
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,510
[SPEAKER_05]: I played World Cup Soccer in 1994.

134
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinball?

135
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:31,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Goal!

136
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:32,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

137
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:33,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

138
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,236
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was pretty full, actually.

139
00:07:38,317 --> 00:07:40,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I did play Portal as well.

140
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished as well.

141
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I also finished all the advanced levels, so that was fun.

142
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:50,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the little ball you get in one of those, too, that you have to carry it around.

143
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:55,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a level where you have the companion cube, but when you're playing it on advanced, it's like a little ball that bounces.

144
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:56,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know,

145
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolls around stuff.

146
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:58,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Not real fun.

147
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:03,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to add that I love the automated weapons.

148
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:06,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

149
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:07,054
[SPEAKER_05]: What they say.

150
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:08,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're cute.

151
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:09,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

152
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Should have a trash can that does that.

153
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:11,616
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

154
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:12,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

155
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:17,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, they should make an automated one like that that shoots like, um... What was it?

156
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:19,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Those soft pellet things?

157
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:20,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

158
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:21,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Airsoft.

159
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:21,859
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great.

160
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Nerf.

161
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

162
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyways.

163
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:25,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

164
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:27,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

165
00:08:27,268 --> 00:08:28,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things I played.

166
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Galaxy.

167
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:34,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Just flat out the best game for the Wii.

168
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's it.

169
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,317
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best Mario game I've played.

170
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels very, very, very much like Mario 64.

171
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Control's awesome.

172
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:43,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks awesome.

173
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,723
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta buy it if you own a Wii.

174
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't own a Wii, you gotta buy a Wii so you can buy the game.

175
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:55,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I played... What else did I play here?

176
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:56,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Scenes Pro.

177
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:57,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Play lots of that.

178
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:02,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill Origins, started that a little bit.

179
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks very, very good on PSP.

180
00:09:04,466 --> 00:09:05,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Very surprised.

181
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:08,748
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke and fog looks amazing.

182
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,248
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to be a great game.

183
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:14,270
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the reviews have said people like this out of the entire series.

184
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the best game.

185
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:20,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Another game I've played that a lot of people are dying to get their hands on is Assassin's Creed.

186
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:22,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost Squad on the Wii.

187
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:54,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the weirdest, dumbest shooter ever, but you gotta buy it.

188
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,724
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be like 30 bucks, comes out in a couple weeks.

189
00:09:56,784 --> 00:10:01,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing the Japanese version, which is all in English anyways, but it is fun.

190
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:08,415
[SPEAKER_02]: We've beat the game like three times today, and as you beat the game, you get like experience points, and you unlock new weapons that make the game harder.

191
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:09,716
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly do you do in this game?

192
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:11,057
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Time Crisis.

193
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:12,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, shooting stuff.

194
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:23,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, I mean, it's just so cheesy and stupid, though, but as you finish the game, you also unlock different levels, um, or the levels get harder, and they have different things that they add in there.

195
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:31,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Works very well with the Wii Remote, um, great gun game, highly recommend it, I mean, especially if you're not looking to spend, like, you know,

196
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,622
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 bucks on Resident Evil, Ghost Squad, definitely a good one to pick up.

197
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:46,146
[SPEAKER_02]: It also does support the Wii Zapper, although I don't have a Wii Zapper, and as far as I can tell, it only uses the remotes, so I don't know why the hell you would use a Wii Zapper with this anyways.

198
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:47,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can, I guess.

199
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last game I played, which is

200
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:53,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Really crappy.

201
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game called Counterforce on the Wii.

202
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not have heard of it, and that's probably a good thing.

203
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:05,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people compared to, I guess, Star Fox, but it's no way near Star Fox.

204
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:09,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just a pile of shit, and you shouldn't play it.

205
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel sorry for all the customers I sold that to.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it shit force?

207
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:14,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's crap.

208
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:15,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap force.

209
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it crap?

210
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:19,717
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

211
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:42,563
[SPEAKER_02]: and it says Counter Force and it has the company that made it.

212
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:49,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's this period out in the middle of nowhere because they didn't format it right and so the period's kind of moved over to the next line or something.

213
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:55,913
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's really cheap looking and it is a cheap game so, I don't know.

214
00:11:56,254 --> 00:12:06,722
[SPEAKER_02]: From the makers of such wonderful games as Ninja Bread Man, Anubis 2 and Billy the Wizard, Rocket Boomstick Racing.

215
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:09,644
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we are not ripping off of Harry Potter even though we are.

216
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost Squad is great, though.

217
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:40,397
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

218
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly the chat room has turned to talk about Ninja Bread Man.

219
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:04,487
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Gerardimo in chat says, Ninja Bread Man, FTW.

220
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:08,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 says, I gotta love those guys just for the name Ninja Bread Man.

221
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:11,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And Actdeft dissents and says, Ninja Bread Man looks crappy.

222
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,293
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

223
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you played this week?

224
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:22,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I did play one thing, but I don't really have much of an impression for it.

225
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:24,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever Blue.

226
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:25,219
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a...

227
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,020
[SPEAKER_02]: underwater, I guess, scuba diving sim for the Wii.

228
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty.

229
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:32,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's sort of like Pokemon Snap.

230
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:39,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the version I played was all in Japanese, and I'm trying to get my hands on an English copy, so I can actually understand what's going on.

231
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:43,803
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can play your own MP3s on it, like Excite Truck, so that's kind of cool.

232
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:53,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Except the MP3s I had in my card at the time were from Excite Truck, so it didn't really fit the underwater Enya that they have normal playing in the game.

233
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, I have some, like,

234
00:13:56,097 --> 00:14:00,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock and Roll stuff, you know, like Paranoia something.

235
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:01,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

236
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:03,339
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

237
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:03,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

238
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

239
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,099
[SPEAKER_03]: So my gaming week then, if you're all finished.

240
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

241
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

242
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,300
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I play this week?

243
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of World of Warcraft.

244
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Also kind of got sucked back into Final Fantasy XI a little bit.

245
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been leveling.

246
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:16,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

247
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:17,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jamie.

248
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you want to say to that?

249
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Rob.

250
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:21,032
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I already gave you hell for it the other day.

251
00:14:48,439 --> 00:14:49,320
[SPEAKER_03]: That noise.

252
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to play this game how I want.

253
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:57,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So therefore, I am going to be a Corsair bard because I like to buff people and both those classes are all about buffing people.

254
00:14:57,506 --> 00:15:02,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Corsairs are awesome because they're based around gambling and bards are awesome because they sing.

255
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, my character is a tacky Las Vegas nightclub act because I gamble and I sing.

256
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:07,755
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

257
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:12,078
[SPEAKER_05]: If I played that again, I would totally play a white mage monk.

258
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:13,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

259
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,322
[SPEAKER_03]: See, we should just have a party of people playing whatever the hell they want.

260
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:18,063
[SPEAKER_05]: But that makes sense though, a white mage and a monk.

261
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:28,263
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says Rob likes to buff people very funny, jerk what are you laughing at?

262
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:30,405
[SPEAKER_03]: you have an aim chatter with a comment?

263
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:31,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't read it, what's it say?

264
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:34,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob likes to buff people shut up let's see

265
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:38,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a lot of that.

266
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:44,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually took Corsair from level 10 to level 17 in just a matter of days, so that should tell you about how much I was playing.

267
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:48,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I also was playing on the Nintendo Wii a little bit, because I was looking for the Check Me Out channel.

268
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,052
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't there yet, but I did download Super Mario Bros.

269
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,333
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, and I was playing a little bit of that, because that is a classic game.

270
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:57,994
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what, when you play Super Mario Bros.

271
00:15:58,354 --> 00:16:02,516
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, if you're playing on a widescreen TV and you have it scrunched in...

272
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:04,505
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

273
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Bros. 3

274
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,921
[SPEAKER_02]: The authentic Super Mario Bros.

275
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:46,662
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.

276
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Joel Neer in chat is asking, what about the new dancer job of Final Fantasy XI?

277
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I am excited for the new jobs.

278
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:53,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Scholar and Dancer look good.

279
00:16:53,768 --> 00:16:54,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope there's a third one.

280
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:58,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see Geomancer or something, but I hear it's not going to happen.

281
00:16:58,693 --> 00:16:59,513
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only going to be the two.

282
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:03,177
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Shane, who you've probably heard on the show.

283
00:17:03,257 --> 00:17:03,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

284
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:04,578
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only the two.

285
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:06,199
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to say it's only the two jobs.

286
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dancer and what's the other one?

287
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:08,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholar is the other one.

288
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:10,238
[SPEAKER_03]: How the fuck's Scholar?

289
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholar was, like, kind of obscure.

290
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:14,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Scholar was... I'm smart!

291
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not going to help you in fighting enemies.

292
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Scholar is like a combination of White Mage and Black Mage, but they're not a Red Mage.

293
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:23,683
[SPEAKER_03]: They use what's called, I think it's called Grimoire or something.

294
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:35,867
[SPEAKER_03]: They use this to basically strengthen the White Magic and weaken the Black Magic if you use a White Scholar, or a White Grimoire, or there's the Black one that will strengthen the Black Magic and weaken the White Magic, and they have their own unique spells.

295
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,007
[SPEAKER_03]: There's support for the support.

296
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:37,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

297
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:39,689
[SPEAKER_03]: The rumor is they get the reflect spell.

298
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,311
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have reflect, which is a spell that's missing from the game.

299
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So then they're going to basically be like the...

300
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:51,664
[SPEAKER_05]: for lack of a better description, like the ones that reflect the enemy.

301
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:58,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, here's what it really is, is that the scholar artifact armor, which is like the endgame armor, is a school outfit.

302
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you can actually be a Japanese schoolgirl in the game.

303
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:05,037
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just go to the reality of why we're doing this job.

304
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:07,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese schoolgirls everywhere.

305
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm guessing that we're going to see lots of...

306
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,961
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

307
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough about Final Fantasy XI.

308
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, what else have I played on?

309
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:39,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox.

310
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:40,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Guitar Hero.

311
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:45,892
[SPEAKER_03]: We had people over here last night because the night started at John's Incredible Pizza, which is this chain.

312
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:49,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I think mostly only exists in Central California, like Fresno, I think is where it started.

313
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,318
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's up here in Roseville.

314
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:51,859
[SPEAKER_03]: They have one.

315
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Our show is based out of Sacramento, Roseville being a suburb.

316
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I sometimes forget we have people all around that listen.

317
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:01,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, we're at this John's Incredible Pizza, which is basically like a Dave and Buster's for kids.

318
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:05,348
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a big pizza buffet, and then they have this game room.

319
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:06,950
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have rides in the joint.

320
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,974
[SPEAKER_03]: This place used to be a Sam's Club, and they totally converted it into this ginormous pizza place.

321
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have video games, and we started the night playing.

322
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:20,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing DDR Supernova, and my boyfriend William is so hilarious because while I was playing, this like,

323
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,200
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

324
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:47,644
[SPEAKER_03]: He's great.

325
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:49,826
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these days I will let him come on the show.

326
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:51,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be fantastic.

327
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:52,088
[SPEAKER_03]: He's hilarious.

328
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:55,150
[SPEAKER_05]: He was very funny at dinner, by the way.

329
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,731
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the best.

330
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:56,151
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the best.

331
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:56,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

332
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're all in Central California.

333
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:01,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to stop gushing so much.

334
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:11,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, here's the other thing about John's Incredible Peach that I thought was hilarious is that pretty much outside of DDR and some random shooter games, it was all ticket games.

335
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, gambling for kids basically, right?

336
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:14,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

337
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:15,872
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

338
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:54,006
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy out your case or whatever like it's basically the show but with tickets I couldn't believe it I was like floored but then this place had rides in it like it had a roller coaster inside which I thought was crazy kind of a fun little place I'm sure they'll do well Gerardimo says deal or no deal is too expensive to play

339
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:57,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says, yay, gambling is good for you.

340
00:20:57,374 --> 00:20:59,055
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, jump in jackpot.

341
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:02,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, this place had not one, but two jump in jackpot machines.

342
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:09,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those in New York City that went when I was there and we had the OLR meetup, I got further in jumping jackpot than I ever have before.

343
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:15,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the machine was set to an easier difficulty, but I got all the way to like the O in jackpot, and then I lost.

344
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so pissed.

345
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:22,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, jump in jackpot is that jump rope game with the random Eurobeat music that sounds like Flamin' Finger.

346
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,361
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

347
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:37,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

348
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:37,956
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cake is a Lie shirt?

349
00:21:38,056 --> 00:21:38,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

350
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:39,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

351
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:44,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to say, oh yes, so since they were out of beer mugs, the idea was to come back to my place and drink.

352
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,982
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody came over, those of us that went out, there's about seven of us that went out, and we came back here and we played Guitar Hero.

353
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:50,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody was learning how to play.

354
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:55,425
[SPEAKER_03]: William played for the first time, some other people I just met were playing for the first time, we were all having a good time.

355
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:58,367
[SPEAKER_03]: So Guitar Hero, great party game, even though I only have one guitar.

356
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:00,150
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've been playing through that.

357
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got some achievements for getting all the five stars on Medium, and now I'm finally working on hard and expert songs, and it's hard.

358
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:10,604
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I could come over one day and bring one of my controllers.

359
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:10,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You should.

360
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:13,367
[SPEAKER_03]: We should rock out, do some co-op, be fun.

361
00:22:13,868 --> 00:22:15,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I want rock bands so much.

362
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,191
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to say this.

363
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That Dragonforce song is the fucking shit.

364
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that song, seriously.

365
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,780
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing I noticed about Dragonforce.

366
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so into that song, even though playing it sucks.

367
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:34,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so into that song, I went and looked them up on iTunes, and seriously, all of their songs sound exactly the same.

368
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:36,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my friend has a CD of them.

369
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:37,884
[SPEAKER_03]: They're awesome.

370
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:44,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I'm going to look them up on the store real quick and play some of this for you guys.

371
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how well it's going to run, though, because we have the webcam going, so it's kind of slow.

372
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,842
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much all I wanted to say about my gaming week.

373
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:56,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else want to add anything on their gaming weeks before we move on?

374
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:00,348
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

375
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's the song from Guitar Hero.

376
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:04,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if this will actually play.

377
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:05,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be too slow.

378
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:07,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was trying to sync with my iPod, too.

379
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock!

380
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:26,329
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be a DDR song.

381
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:30,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that sound like a song from hell for Guitar Hero?

382
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:31,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's some of their other music.

383
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:34,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a song called Operation Ground and Pound.

384
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:38,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's loading.

385
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:39,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a moment.

386
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:40,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently the...

387
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much sounds exactly the same, right?

388
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:52,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Also would be a hellacious song to Guitar Hero.

389
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally want to drive to this.

390
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:01,717
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be my custom soundtrack to Burnout.

391
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:03,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one more for you guys.

392
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:04,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution Death Squad.

393
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:08,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

394
00:24:09,262 --> 00:24:09,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

395
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

396
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:17,076
[SPEAKER_05]: They really do sound the same.

397
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,480
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make ringtones out of them.

398
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,161
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

399
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:27,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear, though, that the drummer is actually drumming that.

400
00:24:28,825 --> 00:24:29,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, that's so crazy.

401
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:30,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Cry for Eternity.

402
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:31,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

403
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:31,667
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

404
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,187
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

405
00:24:33,928 --> 00:24:34,909
[SPEAKER_03]: This band is awesome.

406
00:24:40,753 --> 00:24:41,374
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

407
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least your drummer doesn't have to have any talent.

408
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:48,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wait.

409
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:52,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine what these concerts must be like?

410
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:56,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, people die in mosh pits.

411
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:57,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

412
00:24:58,578 --> 00:25:01,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be like a Death Clock concert.

413
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Force is like one of my new favorite bands, seriously.

414
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:09,385
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I will tell you why Guitar Hero 3 pisses me off, as well as Rock Band.

415
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,866
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why these games piss me off?

416
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:12,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Lack of journey.

417
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:16,068
[SPEAKER_05]: AZHP says most relaxing game ever plus Dragon Force equals wins.

418
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:40,150
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the perfect music for it.

419
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,052
[SPEAKER_03]: You should put that in your little ocean exploring game.

420
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be like a Katamari game.

421
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:50,437
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

422
00:25:51,077 --> 00:25:55,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Carizzle says, I would be all over a Dragon Force downloadable content pack for Guitar Hero 3.

423
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:59,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I refuse to pay the high prices, but I would just have to if they came out with a Dragon Force pack.

424
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:01,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought the Foo Fighters one.

425
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:02,245
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

426
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:03,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Foo Fighters.

427
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, what we need to do is we need to do a video segment.

428
00:26:05,706 --> 00:26:08,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Crappy games that are made better through Dragon Force.

429
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this idea.

430
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:11,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this idea.

431
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I fully support that thought.

432
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Crappy games made better with the music of Dragon Force.

433
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,253
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a brilliant idea.

434
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:18,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent pending.

435
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:20,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody better copy that shit because we're going to put it out there on the internet.

436
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:22,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

437
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:25,837
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be a crappy game we can make better with music from Dragon Force?

438
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbie Island Princess.

439
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:33,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I don't think that has custom soundtracks because it's not on the 360.

440
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:38,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what game, because you can turn the... Viva Piñata Party Animals.

441
00:26:38,734 --> 00:26:38,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

442
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it has racing in it.

443
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:41,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Fusion Frenzy.

444
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:42,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusion Frenzy 2.

445
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:45,218
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be game to give me back, though.

446
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:46,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

447
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,402
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that the last really awful game, because usually I wait to play a game until I'm sure I'm really going to like it.

448
00:26:54,923 --> 00:26:59,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember renting a game, though, one time from Blockbuster that was so bad, we went back and asked for our money back.

449
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:03,187
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

450
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna email them.

451
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:33,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

452
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:33,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

453
00:27:34,473 --> 00:27:35,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it doesn't hurt.

454
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Find who their publicist is.

455
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna laugh fast.

456
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:40,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, chat room, chat room.

457
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:44,980
[SPEAKER_05]: What we should try to do, and, you know, we were supposed to play Super Metroid back in the day.

458
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Dragon Force to do the new theme for our show.

459
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:49,083
[SPEAKER_03]: We should ask them.

460
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:49,683
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be rad.

461
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:50,304
[SPEAKER_05]: But, Rob.

462
00:27:50,964 --> 00:27:51,284
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

463
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:53,065
[SPEAKER_05]: We should bring over Vibraban.

464
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:55,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you okay?

465
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:56,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't die.

466
00:27:57,128 --> 00:27:57,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And put it on Op 11.

467
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:58,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

468
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:00,827
[SPEAKER_03]: The Awesomeness of Dragon Force

469
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:17,540
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, speaking of Guitar Hero, if you're playing Guitar Hero, join the Guitar Hero OL Army.

470
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,101
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more information in our LiveJournal community, on our MySpace, also on the forums.

471
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:26,382
[SPEAKER_03]: The Guitar Hero OL Army is still in the top 100, I'm proud to say.

472
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:29,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you everybody who's joined and made it a success.

473
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:35,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Richie Maniac is now at the top of our boards, by the way, and he has like over 2,500 groupies.

474
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:39,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So he probably is playing Dragon Force over and over again to get that highest score, so...

475
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:41,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Props to you, my friend.

476
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have some.

477
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:42,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

478
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:51,044
[SPEAKER_05]: For anyone who's playing on the same server that I am for Ragnarok Online and playing on Deliverance Online, I'm making our guild tonight.

479
00:28:52,346 --> 00:28:52,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

480
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:55,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the character to look for is Cecily.

481
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but don't find me because I don't really want to.

482
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're going to, and how can they get to your Ragnarok server if they want to join the Ragnarok OLR?

483
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:05,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Just look for Deliverance Online.

484
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,926
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do a search for it, it's going to be the first thing that comes up on Google.

485
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:09,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Swell.

486
00:29:10,026 --> 00:29:15,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but that's the, my primary character that I will be making available for the OLR me.

487
00:29:15,927 --> 00:29:17,467
[SPEAKER_03]: You will post that in the forums too, right?

488
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:18,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually.

489
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:19,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

490
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:20,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday.

491
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:21,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon.

492
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:24,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Guitar Hero, did anybody see this week's South Park?

493
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:26,303
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't watch TV.

494
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:29,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a parody of Guitar Hero, and it was kind of funny.

495
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:31,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it wasn't LOL funny, but it was, you know, haha.

496
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:36,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a parody of rock superstardom, but with Guitar Hero.

497
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:43,752
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what, the funniest part was the very end, when Stan and Kyle are finally reunited, and they are going to break a million points in Guitar Hero.

498
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you'll get a kick out of this.

499
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:47,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to do it!

500
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:47,914
Yeah!

501
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:57,457
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it!

502
00:29:57,817 --> 00:29:59,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my sweet Jesus!

503
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:03,900
[SPEAKER_00]: You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach 1 million points!

504
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations!

505
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:13,324
[SPEAKER_00]: You are BAD!

506
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:17,546
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

507
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:23,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you'd think I would be offended or something, but seriously, that shit's hilarious.

508
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:24,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was on the ground laughing.

509
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:29,151
[SPEAKER_03]: But the funniest part was my roommate walked in, and he hadn't seen any of the episode.

510
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:30,351
[SPEAKER_03]: He just saw, like, the very end.

511
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:34,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he saw that, and he's watched me play Guitar Hero, like, tons throughout the day.

512
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,233
[SPEAKER_03]: His jaw was just, like, on the ground.

513
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:37,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't believe they just said that.

514
00:30:38,014 --> 00:30:38,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was funny.

515
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:41,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally want an icon of their expressions in that picture.

516
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:45,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You are fags.

517
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:47,317
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

518
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:55,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's get into tonight's... Oh, wait, really quickly, one more housekeeping thing.

519
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:56,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so horrible.

520
00:30:56,274 --> 00:30:59,776
[SPEAKER_03]: This week marks the fifth anniversary of Xbox Live.

521
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:00,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you believe it?

522
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:08,699
[SPEAKER_03]: November 15th is the day that Xbox Live turns five, which made me think this week, one, we're older than Xbox Live because we're five and a half years old.

523
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,520
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, rock on.

524
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,101
[SPEAKER_05]: We were here from the beginning.

525
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:14,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock on for Xbox Live turning five this week.

526
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:16,642
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're doing, like, all these types of contests.

527
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:20,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And who knows what other kind of crap is going to be up on Xbox, like

528
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:30,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, you know, retrospective stuff and maybe some new trailers and icons and backgrounds and I'm sure they're going to celebrate over there at Xbox.

529
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:34,159
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why I say that is that Xbox Live is very good with the community.

530
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:46,443
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, out of probably the big three, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Microsoft's very good with the community and I think, therefore, the community should support them for, you know, reaching out and caring about the independent scene.

531
00:31:46,743 --> 00:31:48,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hurrah to you guys at Xbox.

532
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Xbox, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

533
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, kick it off.

534
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so the fall update's coming.

535
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,641
[SPEAKER_02]: It just might not be for fall.

536
00:31:58,461 --> 00:32:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going to be hitting sometime in December.

537
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:08,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that will be coming with it, of course, is the Xbox 360 Family Timer.

538
00:32:08,063 --> 00:32:13,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that is going to be something that your parents will be able to use to limit the time that kiddies get to play.

539
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:18,685
[SPEAKER_02]: You can limit it down to like two hours, and then after those two hours are up, they have to play...

540
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: or wait 24 hours before they can play their Xbox 360 again.

541
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:28,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an awesome idea that they're able to limit stuff like that play time.

542
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:33,747
[SPEAKER_02]: No word though what else will be coming.

543
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,170
[SPEAKER_02]: on that update as well.

544
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,432
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, usually with those dashboard updates, there's a bit more stuff on there.

545
00:32:41,132 --> 00:32:46,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully some more video playback stuff so we can play some DivX maybe, Xvid, that would be nice.

546
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:47,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

547
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:51,877
[SPEAKER_03]: More high def stuff over the internet, not the internet, but the local network would be awesome.

548
00:32:52,718 --> 00:32:54,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I can watch my Dragon Force music videos.

549
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:56,740
[SPEAKER_05]: They have music videos?

550
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,280
[SPEAKER_03]: On iTunes, there's some for sale.

551
00:32:58,681 --> 00:32:59,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just as epic as you'd think.

552
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:00,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just go to YouTube.

553
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:01,242
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

554
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:08,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week, if you're listening to last week's show, we were kind of joking probably more than we needed to about Kmart.

555
00:33:09,222 --> 00:33:10,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember Kmart?

556
00:33:10,203 --> 00:33:17,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that came up, we were talking about is that one of the good things that Kmart is there for is that they tend to break street dates.

557
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:19,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was totally proven this week.

558
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:22,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to say, did we call it or did we call it on last week's show?

559
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:27,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure enough, Kmart has been spotted with copies of Mass Effect.

560
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:54,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Kmart sold a copy of Mass Effect, it looks like in Cropton, Maryland And they are so going to be in trouble tomorrow They're going to be busted, they're going to get the smackdown on that And I believe that was sold Friday or yesterday That's ten days before the official release date of the game And of course the guy bought it and promptly put a picture of it up on the internet with a receipt So you knew he wasn't full of crap So everybody's saying run and check Kmart and see if this is there Because you never know

561
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not the only one, too.

562
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,041
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another guy, too, off of the CheapAssGames forum, I believe, that got one as well.

563
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:02,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

564
00:34:02,482 --> 00:34:06,022
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get your games early, Kmart's the place to go.

565
00:34:06,122 --> 00:34:10,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to check the local one, but I'm sure a lot of the local kids already beat me to it.

566
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:11,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no thanks.

567
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:12,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go to Kmart.

568
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:13,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

569
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:15,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I can wait 10 days.

570
00:34:15,224 --> 00:34:16,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go there if I need socks.

571
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:21,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say, though, Loki was showing off the lesbian scene.

572
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:22,566
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hot.

573
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:23,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very artistic.

574
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:24,852
[SPEAKER_03]: That was hot.

575
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you could respond.

576
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Very artistically done.

577
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:28,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it again.

578
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it again.

579
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go again.

580
00:34:29,977 --> 00:34:30,497
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.

581
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:31,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's party.

582
00:34:31,979 --> 00:34:32,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's party.

583
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:40,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there is a list of the download content available for Rock Band.

584
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is actually a pretty good list.

585
00:34:47,455 --> 00:34:52,996
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got on here, there's a police pack with Roxanne, Synchronicity 2, Can't Stand Losing You.

586
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:57,557
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Queens of Stone Age pack, a Metallica pack that's unannounced.

587
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:03,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Sabbath, David Bowie, and I like that it's got Queen Bitch in it.

588
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:07,519
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a punk pack that has ever fallen in love.

589
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:12,298
[SPEAKER_05]: by the Buzzcocks, I Fought the Law by The Clash, and Rockaway Beach by the Ramones.

590
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:13,558
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a classic there.

591
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:22,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's some single songs, which is Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jukebox Hero by Foreigner, My Sharona, Cherry Bomb.

592
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I like The Runaways.

593
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have that album.

594
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:32,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Joan Jett and Lita Ford.

595
00:35:33,121 --> 00:35:33,842
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

596
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that's funny.

597
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:38,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was going to say there's one that's on there.

598
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Buddy Holly by Weezer.

599
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:42,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking forward to buying that.

600
00:35:42,675 --> 00:35:50,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually going to say there's one song in that, as much as I love Weezer, but there's one song in there that completely just makes me go ha ha.

601
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,841
[SPEAKER_05]: My Iron Lung by Radiohead.

602
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:54,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Radiohead.

603
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:55,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiohead's pretty awesome.

604
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:57,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Radiohead.

605
00:35:57,283 --> 00:35:58,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Creep is in the actual game as well.

606
00:35:59,485 --> 00:35:59,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

607
00:36:00,936 --> 00:36:02,017
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love Radiohead.

608
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:06,019
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to point out there is still a distinct lack of Journey in this list.

609
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:07,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, give it time.

610
00:36:07,419 --> 00:36:07,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it time.

611
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I want my fucking Don't Stop Believin', dammit.

612
00:36:10,521 --> 00:36:11,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're the ones.

613
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:13,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's Journey's fault that this stuff isn't there.

614
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're like little bitches that don't want their fucking music to be in this game.

615
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:17,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, fuck this.

616
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:18,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We remember the Journey game.

617
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:18,985
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked.

618
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:20,406
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just not going to put our music in anything.

619
00:36:20,426 --> 00:36:21,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But Radiohead.

620
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:22,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiohead is cool.

621
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:23,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take that.

622
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Radiohead.

623
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:29,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I was still on the fence about Rock Band, and I'm like, I don't want to spend the $170 on the game.

624
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:34,488
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I was watching some trailers online last night, and keep in mind, I was kind of drunk.

625
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:43,254
[SPEAKER_03]: We drank a lot last night, and the people over here at Guitar Hero, and we were just all in here watching the Rock Band footage going, Oh, we need to get this game.

626
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:45,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks so hot.

627
00:36:45,255 --> 00:36:45,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely getting it.

628
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:47,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to have to get it, too.

629
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:48,817
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife is going to buy it for me for Christmas.

630
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,739
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already decided to get it.

631
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like we're going to have our own little band.

632
00:36:53,624 --> 00:36:54,884
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully I'll have it early.

633
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:56,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

634
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:02,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 says, yes, my Iron Lung is my fave song of the bends.

635
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,727
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so spectacular.

636
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:05,068
[SPEAKER_05]: That is such a good song.

637
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:09,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I have to say overall, my all-time favorite Radiohead song is High and Dry.

638
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:11,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I was going to say, I want High and Dry.

639
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't leave me.

640
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,691
[SPEAKER_05]: But that wouldn't be so rock bandy.

641
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:17,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

642
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:18,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It wouldn't work.

643
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:19,052
[SPEAKER_05]: My Iron Lung is...

644
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:22,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably one of the perfect ones to have in that.

645
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:26,779
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mac Man in our chat room is urging me to hold on to that feelings, guy.

646
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:28,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

647
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.

648
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to write Journey's fan club or something.

649
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:34,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Know somebody who knows the band.

650
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:35,563
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

651
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:36,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep forgetting.

652
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:38,584
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a friend who knows Journey.

653
00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:40,985
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me guitar picks from them.

654
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:41,726
[SPEAKER_03]: We need this to happen.

655
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:45,067
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, said friend, I need to have some words with Journey.

656
00:37:45,107 --> 00:37:45,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we make that happen?

657
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:46,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

658
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:47,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We should get them on the show.

659
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:49,009
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

660
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:50,634
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

661
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:16,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw these!

662
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:50,599
[SPEAKER_02]: with, of course, the comment from EA saying that there's really not going to be a lot out there.

663
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,841
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a pretty good chance it's going to be hard to find.

664
00:38:54,181 --> 00:39:00,645
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the other side, my work side, I can definitely say that there's one hell of a shortage on

665
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:02,974
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

666
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:21,522
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

667
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:33,711
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

668
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:54,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are going to be readily available.

669
00:39:54,922 --> 00:39:58,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just getting the game with that new guitar is going to be hard to find.

670
00:39:58,623 --> 00:40:02,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't care about having the new guitar, because to be honest, it's a wireless big deal.

671
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:04,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The wired one works just fine.

672
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's the case, then get the game by itself, buy a guitar later.

673
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,408
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the thing.

674
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:12,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.

675
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:14,189
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of these new instruments.

676
00:40:14,229 --> 00:40:19,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet you anything if they change the design of the guitar for Guitar Hero 4, we're going to be talking about this all over again.

677
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:21,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why.

678
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:24,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Well thank you for that report.

679
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:30,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you have Guitar Hero 3, there's already some downloadable content available for it.

680
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:33,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I mentioned earlier, I downloaded the Foo Fighters pack for the game.

681
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:34,717
[SPEAKER_03]: That is up and running.

682
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:39,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Foo Fighters pack has The Pretender, All My Life, and the classic This Is A Call.

683
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:40,919
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like their very first single, I think.

684
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know what it was sadly missing?

685
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Was A, Everlong, but I think that song was in Guitar Hero 2, so I think that's why.

686
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,961
[SPEAKER_03]: B, Big Me.

687
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:50,561
[SPEAKER_03]: That song was awesome.

688
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:52,022
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the Mentos in the video.

689
00:40:52,062 --> 00:40:52,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

690
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:53,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when MTV played videos?

691
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Velvet Revolver also has a pack of their own.

692
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:06,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy it yet because I'm not as familiar with Velvet Revolver, but maybe... I hear they actually put trailers on Xbox Live of these packs so you could hear the songs beforehand, which is great.

693
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:10,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a great way to kind of answer that demand of we want to hear this shit before we buy it.

694
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:12,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So props to Microsoft for getting around that.

695
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:21,025
[SPEAKER_03]: But Velvet Revolver, if you do want to buy that, if you're a fan of the band, because I do believe Velvet Revolver is the band that's made up of... Wasn't that Stone Temple Pilots plus the guy from Soundgarden?

696
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe... No, Chris Cornell has...

697
00:41:24,645 --> 00:41:27,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm missing my groups.

698
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I haven't been following my rock bands very well.

699
00:41:30,295 --> 00:41:32,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get yelled at by chat.

700
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:36,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Chris Cornell had a different band, but I think it was somebody else that was in Soundgarden.

701
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:37,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say.

702
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:37,747
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

703
00:41:38,035 --> 00:41:40,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Velvet Revolver is members of Guns N' Roses and Scott Weiland.

704
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:09,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, I had it the other way around or something.

705
00:42:10,315 --> 00:42:12,656
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell am I thinking of that had the guy from Soundgarden?

706
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:13,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Cornell.

707
00:42:13,596 --> 00:42:14,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Audioslave.

708
00:42:14,237 --> 00:42:15,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Audioslave, that was it.

709
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:15,617
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

710
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:17,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was like, yeah, he has a different band.

711
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:21,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Although... Anyway, sorry.

712
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:22,661
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

713
00:42:25,122 --> 00:42:26,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I listen to pop music, all right?

714
00:42:26,683 --> 00:42:28,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention one thing real quick.

715
00:42:28,104 --> 00:42:29,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's Dragon Forge or Journey.

716
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:31,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Since this story didn't make it into the...

717
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Showroll, because it was too late.

718
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:37,188
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii Guitar Hero 3, it only outputs in mono.

719
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:39,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Go monophonic sound!

720
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:40,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Go Nintendo!

721
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Ouch.

722
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's probably Activision.

723
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:45,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, mono!

724
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:48,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

725
00:42:50,913 --> 00:43:01,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there is something for anyone who is looking forward to playing Guitar Hero 3 on the PC, is the 360's wireless Les Paul controller will work on the PC.

726
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,651
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

727
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:36,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Add the wireless gaming receiver with it.

728
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:37,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Might as well do the wired version.

729
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:48,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the other thing, though... I've actually... When we were at Best Buy, I think it was, we actually saw a two-guitar pack for Guitar Hero 3.

730
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:49,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

731
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:55,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it would be pointless for them to not release the same kind of pack for PC as well.

732
00:43:57,238 --> 00:43:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really...

733
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:03,385
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many USB guitars out there now with Guitar Hero.

734
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Just find one that you want and then buy it.

735
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:08,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Explorer controller was kind of ugly.

736
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:12,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, they figure that you're buying all these games.

737
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:13,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Your friends probably own some of the games.

738
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:15,690
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to play two-player if your friend doesn't come over.

739
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them bring their own guitar.

740
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:19,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I heart the Explorer, by the way.

741
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:20,392
[SPEAKER_02]: BYOG!

742
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:24,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, the Les Paul is a lot more hot.

743
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

744
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:35,582
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of going back a couple months, but people might remember that there were some issues with the widescreen in the Xbox 360 version of Bioshock.

745
00:44:36,142 --> 00:44:43,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, 2K is going to be fixing these problems very soon with the next update that's going to be coming out, so all you people can stop bitching about it.

746
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:52,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I think a lot of people have stopped bitching about it and moved on to other games like Halo 3 and games that are possibly coming out next week, so I don't know.

747
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:53,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Viva Piñata

748
00:45:22,658 --> 00:45:26,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we've had, I think there was the story of the marriage proposal in World of Warcraft.

749
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:30,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now we have a story tonight about a Halo 3 marriage proposal.

750
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:41,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was somebody using the forge, the map editor inside Halo 3 to lay down guns and swords in the shape of the words, marry me?

751
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:43,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cute.

752
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:45,083
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the answer?

753
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:47,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming it was yes, but we don't know.

754
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:49,244
[SPEAKER_03]: All we really know is the screenshot.

755
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,265
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer was, boom, headshot.

756
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:53,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

757
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:55,327
[SPEAKER_03]: She said yes and then promptly shot him in the head.

758
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And then proceeded to hump his corpse.

759
00:45:59,129 --> 00:45:59,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

760
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Which might be like the honeymoon, who knows.

761
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:03,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

762
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:05,793
[SPEAKER_04]: La la la la la la la la la.

763
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:12,556
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox user was Moviesign and he was proposing to his longtime girlfriend, Furtive Penguin.

764
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:16,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Xbox Live names.

765
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:18,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Sgt.

766
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:18,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Sausage

767
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:48,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

768
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:49,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

769
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:54,659
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're a real Halo 3 fan, you're going to play Halo 3, I guess.

770
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:55,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

771
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,941
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to go out and do anything else.

772
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:57,963
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to play Halo all day.

773
00:46:58,063 --> 00:47:05,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of which, there is some download content that Bungie has given us some information on.

774
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:08,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not us directly, but they've just given it.

775
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:09,095
[SPEAKER_05]: They give it up.

776
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:15,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, there are some maps that are going to be coming to the Xbox Live Marketplace.

777
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:26,133
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is the OK Corral, which is described as an asymmetrical, medium-sized map.

778
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:29,434
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can fight at high noon at the OK Corral?

779
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:30,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

780
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:31,555
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little silly.

781
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:32,895
[SPEAKER_05]: In your armor, whatever.

782
00:47:33,535 --> 00:47:39,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's one called Purple Rain, spelled R-E-I-G-N, and Jodrell Bank.

783
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:43,803
[SPEAKER_05]: and then Vandelay, which is a simple map.

784
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:48,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

785
00:47:48,946 --> 00:47:52,908
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, when you say that map is called Purple Rain, you know what that makes me think of?

786
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:03,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was not a good movie, no matter what anyone says.

787
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:09,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince is still awesome, even if he's gone crazy in the past five years and now he's suing his fans.

788
00:48:10,126 --> 00:48:11,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

789
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:12,048
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

790
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:16,111
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like suing these websites that use pictures of him.

791
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:23,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like his fan websites, but they use pictures of him and like tattoos of him and his symbols and stuff because he owns them.

792
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:25,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're like fan sites.

793
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:26,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you bite the hand that feeds you?

794
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're crazy.

795
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because he's crazy.

796
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:30,543
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, he wrote Purple Rain.

797
00:48:30,563 --> 00:48:33,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And come on, tell me you do not want to play Halo with this as a custom soundtrack.

798
00:48:36,988 --> 00:48:39,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, Purple Rain.

799
00:48:40,763 --> 00:48:40,963
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

800
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:42,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not want.

801
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:45,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually do like that song.

802
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:45,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Failed.

803
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:47,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

804
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:49,789
[SPEAKER_02]: What you might be able to be doing pretty soon.

805
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, Chocolate Rain.

806
00:48:53,671 --> 00:48:54,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Chocolate Rain.

807
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:58,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmasterosha in the chat says, I guess better than Chocolate Rain?

808
00:48:58,254 --> 00:48:59,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard the song?

809
00:49:00,055 --> 00:49:00,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear that song.

810
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:02,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard Chocolate Rain.

811
00:49:02,537 --> 00:49:04,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually saw the live performance of Chocolate Rain.

812
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:05,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't care.

813
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:12,469
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a guy at my work who was telling everybody about it and he started singing it in his cubicle and I thought it was the most hilarious freaking thing I'd ever heard.

814
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:13,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how I heard about it.

815
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft says Vampire Reign?

816
00:49:16,508 --> 00:49:19,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let the rain, no, what?

817
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:49,245
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess there's a huge loud noise which popped up occasionally on Endurance that they've fixed.

818
00:49:50,145 --> 00:49:58,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other fun things, they have another problem with display updates when viewing through a VGA cable.

819
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:05,571
[SPEAKER_02]: They've added some stuff, the Friends leaderboard now shows extra information such as grade and accuracy, etc.

820
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:11,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiplayer Endurance mode fix for players color swapping sporadically

821
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:15,357
[SPEAKER_02]: and slightly bigger and better explosions.

822
00:50:16,618 --> 00:50:19,020
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta love an update that adds bigger explosions.

823
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:27,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, tell me it's gonna have a chorus in here.

824
00:50:28,627 --> 00:50:31,069
[SPEAKER_03]: All I could find was a bad karaoke version of this song.

825
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:36,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, I was trying to do Blame It on the Rain.

826
00:50:36,913 --> 00:50:38,374
[SPEAKER_03]: This sucks.

827
00:50:39,655 --> 00:50:40,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I ruined the show.

828
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:40,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

829
00:50:41,854 --> 00:50:42,314
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

830
00:51:05,137 --> 00:51:05,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

831
00:51:05,978 --> 00:51:07,599
[SPEAKER_03]: When was the last time she was on the show?

832
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:10,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa was on the show a long time ago.

833
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:11,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to come back.

834
00:51:12,643 --> 00:51:13,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us some more of your stories.

835
00:51:14,224 --> 00:51:16,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa, come back on the show, okay?

836
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:18,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And then do the Russian lady bra story.

837
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, have you tried Boom Boom Rocket with a guitar yet?

838
00:51:23,472 --> 00:51:23,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

839
00:51:24,172 --> 00:51:25,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I just might have to try that.

840
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:25,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

841
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:28,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the YouTube-age, though, of the developers playing it.

842
00:51:28,576 --> 00:51:28,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty funny.

843
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

844
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR might be interesting, but I can only play that game if it was actually set up like DDR.

845
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:36,581
[SPEAKER_03]: How about DDR and the guitar at the same time?

846
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:37,422
[SPEAKER_03]: OMG.

847
00:51:38,164 --> 00:51:38,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame.

848
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have not yet checked out Two Worlds because of the very mixed reviews on it, well, there is now a demo available on the Xbox Live Marketplace, so you can check that out.

849
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:50,508
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a demo of Two Worlds.

850
00:51:50,768 --> 00:51:57,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, this is a game that's supposed to kind of cater to the fans of Oblivion, but it's supposed to be bigger, badder, and better, and it has multiplayer.

851
00:51:57,273 --> 00:52:02,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, their problem was saying it's the most ultimate, like, best RPG ever.

852
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:04,097
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the problem.

853
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,398
[SPEAKER_02]: They shouldn't have marketed it as...

854
00:52:05,796 --> 00:52:06,676
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

855
00:52:26,613 --> 00:52:28,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, what is wrong with these people?

856
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:30,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look, we found 50 bugs later on.

857
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:36,378
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I could understand if we found two bugs or something like that, but 50, come on, that's just lazy.

858
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

859
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,041
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not buggy enough, we don't want it.

860
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:42,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, but don't worry.

861
00:52:42,962 --> 00:52:45,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the PlayStation 3 version will be coming out soon.

862
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:47,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, talk about bugs there.

863
00:52:47,885 --> 00:52:53,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, how about something that's a little bit more cool for people with the iPod who want iPod games?

864
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:55,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Harmonix is giving us

865
00:52:56,513 --> 00:53:08,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase, which is pretty much a very low graphical, given it's an iPod version, sort of, of, I guess it plays sort of like Guitar Hero is supposed to.

866
00:53:09,485 --> 00:53:17,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's... Yeah, it's this, they all are like the same freaking sort of game, essentially, in terms of their gameplay.

867
00:53:19,254 --> 00:53:22,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's you, your songs will interface with

868
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:24,720
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

869
00:53:40,424 --> 00:53:41,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me some iPhone games, people!

870
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:43,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play it on mine.

871
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:44,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I still have an iPod.

872
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:47,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And DarkTetsuya says you can play a Dragon Force on it.

873
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:47,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck yeah.

874
00:53:48,147 --> 00:53:53,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yeah, the phase kind of looks like frequency and amplitude and all that stuff, but it has some zigzag stuff.

875
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:58,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it looks like you can drag back and forth, which I imagine, you know, using the dial, you could do.

876
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:00,973
[SPEAKER_03]: But that kind of came out of nowhere, didn't it?

877
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:02,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew this game was coming, but...

878
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,010
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

879
00:54:34,611 --> 00:54:35,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Official ones.

880
00:54:35,212 --> 00:54:35,973
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do the Nintendo emulator.

881
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:37,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I do agree that they do need iPhone games.

882
00:54:37,635 --> 00:54:38,295
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not official.

883
00:54:38,716 --> 00:54:38,896
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

884
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:40,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to brick my iPhone.

885
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:44,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because if you paid a couple hundred dollars for a fucking phone, you better have something that plays games on it.

886
00:54:45,724 --> 00:54:46,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

887
00:54:46,304 --> 00:54:47,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do have the YouTube channel.

888
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:50,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And the YouTube channel makes everything better.

889
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a YouTube channel and Wii.

890
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:53,853
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

891
00:54:54,434 --> 00:55:05,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so something that's kind of sad, I guess, for some people in the media would be that the NPD group is going to be withholding their hardware sales numbers from the media.

892
00:55:05,863 --> 00:55:09,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they won't know exactly what consoles they're selling and stuff like that.

893
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:11,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad.

894
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:12,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

895
00:55:13,468 --> 00:55:14,509
[SPEAKER_02]: That won't affect me at all.

896
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you going to continue to report the numbers to us here on the show?

897
00:55:18,312 --> 00:55:19,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah, I will.

898
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:19,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

899
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:21,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

900
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:22,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad.

901
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:26,593
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, not that it really matters anyways because it's fucking console sale numbers.

902
00:55:26,633 --> 00:55:30,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they'll have some stupid press release that each company will release.

903
00:55:30,714 --> 00:55:33,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft are not going to shut up about it.

904
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously they're going to release what their console sold.

905
00:55:37,715 --> 00:55:40,876
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like you're so left out about it.

906
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:44,057
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll be happy to report them.

907
00:55:44,597 --> 00:55:45,057
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

908
00:55:45,317 --> 00:55:50,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some numbers that maybe we can be reporting on soon are these new games that are coming out from around the world.

909
00:55:50,398 --> 00:55:52,419
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start tonight with Japanese release dates.

911
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:13,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there is that bundle that's coming with the gun with it, so that'd be cool.

912
00:56:13,291 --> 00:56:17,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavenly Sword makes its way to the Japanese stores November 15th as well.

915
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like another MechWarrior game.

916
00:56:26,735 --> 00:56:28,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's fairly old school.

917
00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:32,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Votoms, I believe, has something to do with the Gundam universe.

918
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:32,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

919
00:56:32,897 --> 00:56:33,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

920
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:36,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, it's coming from Bandai, so that would make sense.

921
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Big surprise!

922
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:45,109

923
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:47,029
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks like a survival horror-ish game to me.

924
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:51,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks very Silent Hill from the cover, but this isn't something I don't think we have over here.

925
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:53,211
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it.

00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:17,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the Peanuts?

929
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:19,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Peanuts is still very, kind of big.

930
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:21,780
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like been a sort of trendy thing lately.

931
00:57:22,101 --> 00:57:23,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And the games don't stop coming.

933
00:57:27,805 --> 00:57:31,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like some type of training game for the DS using the Snoopy characters.

00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:32,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoopy and us together.

941
00:57:46,233 --> 00:57:51,996
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the PSP, and I've got to say, the box arts are very different, so I'm wondering if the games aren't pretty different as well.

942
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:55,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Two completely different versions of Dungeon Explorer.

943

[SPEAKER_05]: Why did I say Karnak?

946
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:05,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Kunark!

947
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:08,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't Karnak Johnny Carson's character?

948
00:58:08,749 --> 00:58:14,251
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's... I'm thinking... Ah, forget it.

00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:30,696
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best name ever, and it would be great if it wasn't Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

956
00:58:31,397 --> 00:58:31,837
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bad name.

957
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:32,237

962
00:59:49,612 --> 00:59:53,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing those are probably just all in the Orange Box, and they probably just list them separate as well.

963
00:59:54,213 --> 00:59:59,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that they actually are getting separate sales, and then you get them bundled as the Orange Box.

964
00:59:59,714 --> 01:00:00,194
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.

965

[SPEAKER_03]: Escapist says, hey, I have my pre-order on Baby Pals.

1039
01:05:04,774 --> 01:05:06,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank goodness Loki reminded me of it.

1040
01:05:07,216 --> 01:05:10,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Dancing with the Stars on PlayStation 2, including a dance pad.

1041
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:13,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear the Wii version is not bad, actually.

1042
01:05:13,761 --> 01:05:15,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be having that for next week.

1043
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that game.

1044
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:20,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Fashion Designer on PC, in case you know.

1045
01:05:21,246 --> 01:05:22,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Babies.

1046
01:05:23,808 --> 01:05:25,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Babies.

1047
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:26,090
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be funny.

1048
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:27,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1049
01:05:29,645 --> 01:05:31,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic Rivals 2 on PSP.

1050
01:05:32,126 --> 01:05:33,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Christ, I thought you were done!

1051
01:05:33,986 --> 01:05:37,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was done too, but hey, this is the biggest week of the year, okay?

1052
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:41,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Game release-wise, so I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.

1053
01:05:43,549 --> 01:05:47,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And America's Army 2, True Soldiers on the Xbox 360.

1054
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:51,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1055
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:54,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Impossible Mission on the DS.

1056
01:05:54,732 --> 01:05:55,452
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll end it right there.

1057
01:05:55,712 --> 01:05:55,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1058
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:58,229
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1059
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:30,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Target strives to provide merchandise that will appeal to a wide variety of guests.

1060
01:06:31,192 --> 01:06:34,333
[SPEAKER_03]: We also want guests to be comfortable with the purchasing decisions they make at Target.

1061
01:06:34,734 --> 01:06:41,237
[SPEAKER_03]: All video games and computer software sold at Target currently carry ratings by the ESRB from early childhood through mature audiences.

1062
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:49,942
[SPEAKER_03]: While Manhunt 2 was given a mature rating by the ESRB, we received additional information that players can potentially view previously filtered content by altering the game code.

1063
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:52,303
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result, we have decided not to carry the game.

1064
01:06:53,214 --> 01:06:59,597
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm sure the millions of people that shop at Target know how to do this to hack their PSP to unlock all the content.

1065
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:02,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys.

1066
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:03,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a little silly.

1067
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:05,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it's their choice.

1068
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,001
[SPEAKER_03]: People just get it other places.

1069
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:08,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Target doesn't like money.

1070
01:07:09,882 --> 01:07:10,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess not.

1071
01:07:10,502 --> 01:07:11,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad.

1072
01:07:11,443 --> 01:07:14,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is Manhunt 2 really going to be that big a big seller?

1073
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:16,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those games that's kind of all talk.

1074
01:07:16,485 --> 01:07:16,906
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1075
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:18,166
[SPEAKER_03]: It is all talk.

1076
01:07:19,487 --> 01:07:19,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1077
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:23,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, still, this news about Manhunt 2 makes me very angry.

1078
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:27,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about you guys, but I get very angsty when I hear about this kind of censorship.

1079
01:07:27,471 --> 01:07:29,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means we need to do the FUs of the week.

1080
01:07:40,455 --> 01:07:42,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, do you have any FUs you'd like to share with us?

1081
01:07:43,255 --> 01:07:44,476
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Mr. Annoying.

1082
01:07:46,316 --> 01:07:46,957
[SPEAKER_05]: My co-worker.

1083
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

1084
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:52,222
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go to work, I do not want to hear the word of God!

1085
01:07:54,543 --> 01:08:02,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to hear, oh, my productivity sucks, and then see you get up from your desk 50,000 times a day and not do your crap.

1086
01:08:02,505 --> 01:08:07,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired of you bitching like a menopausal woman.

1087
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:10,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Just shut up.

1088
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for helping me with my work.

1089
01:08:13,628 --> 01:08:17,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, if you're not having more time during the day to play games,

1090
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:19,599
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got.

1091
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,320
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU goes to work drama.

1092
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I don't think things have been going that bad.

1093
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:31,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, you know, I still love my job and what I do day time, but there was a little bit of drama this past week, but it's nothing we'll get past.

1094
01:08:31,201 --> 01:08:34,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, getting through it is a little bit of an FU.

1095
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:36,582
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1096
01:08:37,243 --> 01:08:38,203
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to drama in general.

1097
01:08:39,023 --> 01:08:40,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't want no drama.

1098
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:40,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not want.

1099
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:44,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on with this week's gaming news then.

1100
01:08:45,856 --> 01:09:05,981
[SPEAKER_05]: well for uh people who've been keeping up with the news on the Max Payne movie 20th Century Fox has asked Mark Wahlberg to be in it and he said okay at least that's what we're hearing so far so um I think it'll be cool with him in it I mean he's a good actor better than his rap career

1101
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:11,725
[SPEAKER_02]: He was pretty good in The Departed as an angry cop, and he's also good in The Wii on the night as an angry cop.

1102
01:09:11,785 --> 01:09:13,785
[SPEAKER_02]: He was great in Boogie Nights.

1103
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:17,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this movie where he plays an angry cop, it should work.

1104
01:09:18,246 --> 01:09:21,307
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think he's got the angry cop roll down.

1105
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:27,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Akira Yamaoka is actually working on a brand new game series.

1106
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:33,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's untitled yet, but glad to know that he's moving beyond Silent Hill.

1107
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:35,150
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I

1108
01:09:35,623 --> 01:09:37,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's moving on beyond Silent Hill.

1109
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:39,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be Silent Hill the Musical, maybe.

1110
01:09:40,884 --> 01:09:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

1111
01:09:42,364 --> 01:09:48,546
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but no idea what kind of game it is, what platform it is, but he says it should be announced soon.

1112
01:09:49,906 --> 01:09:51,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's coming soon.

1113
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:52,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon.

1114
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:55,247
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's coming from Akira Yamaoka, like seriously, how can it be bad?

1115
01:09:55,267 --> 01:09:56,447
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

1116
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:57,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't really be bad.

1117
01:09:57,448 --> 01:10:00,288
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I don't know.

1118
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:03,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of feel left out with Konami right now.

1119
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:04,919
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1120
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:34,707
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys need to check out.

1121
01:10:34,827 --> 01:10:35,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the classic game of the week.

1122
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:41,111
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what is this week's pick for the classic game of the week?

1123
01:10:41,591 --> 01:10:45,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I've brought this game up several times, and it's just about damn time I said something about it.

1124
01:10:45,713 --> 01:10:49,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's game of the week is Blazing Star for the Neo Geo.

1125
01:10:50,316 --> 01:10:50,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1126
01:10:50,936 --> 01:10:53,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually will play some clips from Blazing Star.

1127
01:10:53,578 --> 01:10:55,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get into some actual gameplay here.

1128
01:10:55,519 --> 01:10:56,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the intro song is good.

1129
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:57,921
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to do the intro?

1130
01:10:57,961 --> 01:10:58,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why not?

1131
01:11:01,078 --> 01:11:04,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And the intro is all, you know, rendered and pretty and everything.

1132
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:10,123
[SPEAKER_05]: But the game itself is, it's for the most part 2D with some CG.

1133
01:11:10,243 --> 01:11:11,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty, pretty sweet.

1134
01:11:12,404 --> 01:11:16,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's basically, like I was saying, a side-scrolling shooter.

1135
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:20,869
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually fairly, it's the sequel to Polestar.

1136
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:25,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star is just really, really good.

1137
01:11:25,892 --> 01:11:29,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually related to R-Type in it.

1138
01:11:30,598 --> 01:11:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1139
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they going to put this on a virtual console?

1140
01:11:58,066 --> 01:11:58,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

1141
01:11:58,807 --> 01:11:59,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never played this.

1142
01:11:59,387 --> 01:11:59,747
[SPEAKER_03]: They better.

1143
01:12:00,068 --> 01:12:11,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I had actually played this quite a bit when I lived in Alabama, and I was very sad because the machine that I played it on was actually broken into, and the cartridge stole it out of it.

1144
01:12:12,376 --> 01:12:12,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

1145
01:12:13,097 --> 01:12:15,819
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of those multi-AVS machines.

1146
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,142
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, Crestview Lanes.

1147
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,570
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1148
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:45,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're timed on the bosses, I noticed.

1149
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:46,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you are timed on the bosses.

1150
01:12:47,411 --> 01:12:52,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't beat them within the time limit, you still progress, but you don't get the points for beating the boss.

1151
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:52,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1152
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:54,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of different.

1153
01:12:55,374 --> 01:12:55,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1154
01:12:56,274 --> 01:12:57,615
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I'm right, I think it takes life.

1155
01:12:58,635 --> 01:12:58,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1156
01:12:59,895 --> 01:13:00,416
[SPEAKER_03]: You beat it.

1157
01:13:00,456 --> 01:13:01,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Your skill is great.

1158
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the congratulatory message.

1159
01:13:03,786 --> 01:13:09,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You also collect letters as you go through and it gives you more power-ups and bonuses as you go through the game.

1160
01:13:09,949 --> 01:13:10,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1161
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:16,993
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is basically, you have a fire button and you have a bomb button.

1162
01:13:17,213 --> 01:13:18,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have charged attacks.

1163
01:13:20,074 --> 01:13:22,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very, very, very, very cool.

1164
01:13:23,436 --> 01:13:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1165
01:13:24,397 --> 01:13:28,999
[SPEAKER_05]: And people complained that Blazing Star was sort of, you know, dumbed down for its difficulty from Polestar.

1166
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

1167
01:13:31,178 --> 01:13:41,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Blazing Star is still pretty damn hard once you get past the first few stages, but it's just really... I think that my favorite ship to play in that game is the Green one.

1168
01:13:43,925 --> 01:13:44,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1169
01:13:44,905 --> 01:13:51,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, the graphics in this game, for some reason, I don't know why, it reminds me a little bit of UN Squadron, just the art style, for some reason.

1170
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:52,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

1171
01:14:19,036 --> 01:14:27,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going to bring us to a close here for Part A of our podcast, but fear not, because we tape for several hours every Sunday night, and Part B will be on its way.

1172
01:14:27,887 --> 01:14:33,034
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys listening on the podcast feed, we'll see you in a couple days here with Orange Launch Radio Part B. Stay tuned.
