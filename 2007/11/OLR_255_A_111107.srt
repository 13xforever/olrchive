00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, November 11th, 2007, Manhunt 2 disappears from Target.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
New patch lets you play Boom Boom Rocket with your guitar.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And can your PlayStation 3 warranty be voided by dust?

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hi everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How are you doing, Dark Sakura?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've been fed now. I'm feeling a lot better.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're full of burrito from one of our local joints, Aldebare Toast.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not really supposed to be eating that.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is this horchata?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, it's Diet Coke.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I love horchata.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I love horchata too, however, because this is pretty much the only other thing I've eaten today.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I figured a burrito wouldn't kill me.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Horchata's probably not very good for you because they taste like liquid churros.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh my god, they're so good though.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For anyone who doesn't know what an horchata is, it's a sweet rice drink.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's delicious. It tastes like liquid churro.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's got cinnamon in it. It's really delicious.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Good times.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But the only other thing I had today was a low-carb tortilla with peanut butter on it.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I wasn't hungry after that. I was like, wow, I'm so not hungry.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's because peanut butter is awesome.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then I started getting hungry right before I had to leave the house.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then I started getting sleepy too, so I had caffeine and food.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here we go turning into the food cast again.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why is it at the beginning of every episode of Orange on the Radio or like the food cast?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Because I always bring in my dinner and you have to comment on it.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm just jealous because I'm hungry.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I haven't really eaten.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, I ate a little bit.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I have Belgian chocolate too.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm going to make you some spaghetti, Rob.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you have spaghetti?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A spaghetti.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All right.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Joining us as well, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hello.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How are you doing, Loki?

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Doing good.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Awesome.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What have you been playing over there on the PSP?

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I was yelling at Loki just before the show to turn it down because I couldn't hear the regular stuff

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
because I was being distracted by the PSP.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you playing on the PSP, Loki?

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Silent Hill Origins.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Nice.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Good times?

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is it fun?

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, it's pretty good.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Awesome.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, I'm sure we will hear more about that during the How Is Your Gaming Week,

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
which is our first segment we always get into.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Unfortunately, no guests in the studio tonight.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's just the three of us.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But that's okay because we always have our fourth guest.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, we love the guests.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But many of them are having birthdays this week.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll get to that in just a little bit.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
For now, I want to introduce the ever-present other guest on our program.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's all of you in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com,

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
for those of you guys that join us live when we tape on Sunday nights.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I understand there's some new folks in chat tonight.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Joel Nier said he or she was new when they joined, so welcome, newbie.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I'm not sure if we have any other newbies, but welcome to all the newbies in chat.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We like new people.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right, let's start off with How Is Your Gaming Week.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, wait.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, Dark Cyber's mouth is full of burrito and is unable to.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't talk with my mouth full.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's good.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm glad you have manners.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like, a certain coworker of mine does.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, my God.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, that's getting to eff yous.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This week, I was playing Cooking Mama.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm playing Eating Mama.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Anyway, my gaming week, I actually did something other than Ragnarok.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I look like I had to play a shitload of Ragnarok, but still.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I got a level from zero, of course being Uber Noob, to, I think, 82 in three days.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Nerd.

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It doesn't matter.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, anyway, I also played slash watched.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I played a little watched a lot of Portal.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Finally, and I've seen the ending, it's fucked up, and I love it.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, Dan's going to rent it for me from his store, because the good thing about being

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
a manager at GameCrazy is that he can get me free rentals at Hollywood Video.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So, he's just going to bring me home Portal one day.

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And he said he was going to laugh at me when I got really motion sick.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I was like, uh-uh, I'm going to stop every two levels.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Take a little breather.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Of course, it's like such a quick game.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's like, wow, this is three hours of quick.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, you know that is good gaming ethics, is that you're actually supposed to, if you

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
actually read an instruction manual, it says like you're supposed to take a break of 10

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to 15 minutes for every like two hours of gameplay.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's not really ethics.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's self-care.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How many folks really do, you're right, it's not really ethics.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't know where I pulled that word from.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ethics is not unplugging somebody else's controller.

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Exactly.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When they're kicking your ass at Street Fighter.

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Which I've done, but I'm not an ethical gamer.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Anyway.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But I want one of those shirts that they're plugging in the chat room.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, Tiger Claw is plugging a cake is a lie t-shirt.

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But they don't have girly shirts.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They don't have them girl cut.

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, that sucks.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wear a boy's shirt.

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Girls can get away with that.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It looks weird, though, if you've got big boobs.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Because you either have to get one that's really way too tight and uncomfortable.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So if you have big boobs, then your shirt says, the cake is a lie.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Otherwise, you have to get one that's too big and looks all dumpy.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But my friend, though, has the best t-shirt ever.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I have to share this with everybody.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She has a shirt with two 20-sided die on.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's set to 20.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And says, yes, they're natural.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nice.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I went to see my friend Becky yesterday.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is where I watched a whole bunch of Portal as we went over to a party that had cheesecake.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So I was going around all day saying the cheesecake was a lie.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So that I wouldn't eat any.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm surprised no one's had a Portal party yet.

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What they need to do is record the little music that's playing on the radio in there.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I know.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And just blast it on little radios.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A Portal party, yay.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And you could actually probably easily make one of the...

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's what I'm going to do for my next cosplay.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't you think that cosplay for Portal characters and stuff is going to be really popular, though?

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think it's...

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm just going to carry one of those little...

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Team Fortress 2, I think, is going to be popular.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm just going to carry one of those eyeball things around.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Or a weighted companion cube.

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everybody, you're invited to our Portal party.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Dress up like your favorite character.

148
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It'll be fun.

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
All two of them?

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Or three?

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And the only time you actually see your character is you happen to be looking through another Portal.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Which is kind of...

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh my God, though.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's one part I got so nauseous.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's like this...

157
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm trying to remember exactly...

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, I want one.

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's so cute.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A little plushy companion cube?

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I want one, totally.

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But anyway, it's this one part...

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I don't remember exactly the puzzle, but you're trying to build up enough speed to jump across from one of the slanted platforms on top to the other side.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And so you have to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and then shoot the other Portal and go through it so that you got enough momentum.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I got so freaking sick.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I had to leave my room, but that was about it.

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You should try to get the achievement for the 30,000 foot drop or whatever.

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That'll make you sick.

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You have to drop for six minutes.

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This was on a laptop, so the resolution was so high that it really, really bugged me.

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But it was very good.

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So anything else for your gaming week?

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I played World Cup Soccer in 1994.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Pinball?

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Goal!

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good times.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
My gaming week was pretty full, actually.

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, so I did play Portal as well.

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I finished it as well.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I also finished all the advanced levels, so that was fun.

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I like the little ball you get in one of those, too, that you have to carry it around.

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a level where you have the companion cube, but when you're playing advanced, it's like a little ball that bounces.

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So it rolls around and stuff.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Not real fun.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I do have to add that I love the automated weapons.

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, yeah.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What'd they say?

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, they're cute.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Sorry.

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Should I have a trash can that does that?

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That'd be cool.

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Anyways, ooh, they should make an automated one like that that shoots those soft pellet things.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That would be great.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Or Nerf.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, anyways, let's see.

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Other things I played, Super Mario Galaxy, just flat out the best game for the Wii.

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I mean, that's it.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's the best Mario game I've played.

202
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It feels very, very, very much like Mario 64.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The control's awesome.

204
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Looks awesome.

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You gotta buy it if you own a Wii.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And if you don't own a Wii, you gotta buy a Wii so you can buy the game.

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then I played, what else did I play here?

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Coruscant's Pro.

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I played lots of that.

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Silent Hill Origins, just started that a little bit.

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Looks very, very good on a PSP.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Very surprised.

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The smoke and fog looks amazing.

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But it's gonna be a great game.

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
A lot of the reviews have said people like this out of the entire series.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Probably the best game.

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Another game I played that a lot of people are dying to get their hands on is Assassin's Creed.

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And that one's a pretty unique game.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
When you first start it, you're gonna understand why it's a little different than a lot of people had thought.

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
A lot of weird sci-fi stuff in it, that's for sure.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But it looks awesome.

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It controls very easy.

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's gonna be a great game.

224
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But the game I've been playing most this week, especially on the Wii, not Super Mario Galaxy, actually.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ghost Squad on the Wii.

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Probably the weirdest, dumbest shooter ever, but you gotta buy it.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's gonna be like 30 bucks, comes out in a couple weeks.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I've been playing the Japanese version, which is all in English anyways.

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But it is fun.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We've beat the game like three times today.

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And as you beat the game, you get experience points and you unlock new weapons that make the game harder.

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What exactly do you do in this game?

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's just like time crisis.

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's just, you know, shooting stuff.

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And it's just so cheesy and stupid, though.

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But as you finish the game, you also unlock different levels.

237
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Or the levels get harder and they have different things that they add in there.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Works very well with the Wii Remote.

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Great gun game.

240
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Highly recommend it.

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's a good game to spend like, you know, 50 bucks on Resident Evil.

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ghost Squad, definitely a good one to pick up.

243
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It also does support the Wii Zapper, although I don't have a Wii Zapper.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And as far as I can tell, it only uses the remotes.

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I don't know why the hell you would use a Wii Zapper with this anyways.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But you can, I guess.

247
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And then the last game I played, which is really crappy, is a game called Counter Force on the Wii.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You might not have heard of it, and that's probably a good thing.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's people compared to, I guess, Star Fox, but it's no way near Star Fox.

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It is just a pile of shit, and you shouldn't play it.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And I feel sorry for all the customers I sold that to.

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Is it Shit Force?

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's just, it's crap.

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Crap Force.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why is it crap?

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Shovelware, I guess.

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why is it crap? I'm trying to get people to elaborate.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why is it crap? The graphics are very simple, very stupid.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It doesn't control very well.

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It looks like it's thrown together really quick, almost like in Flash.

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's just, I mean, a perfect example.

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's a, in the very beginning one, you know how you pull up the title in a disc menu or whatever?

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It says Counter Force, and it has, you know, the company that made it.

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, there's this period out in the middle of nowhere because they didn't format it, right?

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And so the period's kind of moved over to the next line or something.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's just, it's really cheap looking, and it is a cheap game, so.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know.

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
From the makers of such wonderful games as Ninja Bread Man,

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Anubis 2, and Billy the Wizard, Rocket Boomstick Racing,

270
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
no, we are not ripping off of Harry Potter, even though we are.

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

272
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's a pretty impressive lineup, I don't know.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I just played it because I knew it was going to be crap,

274
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
and it's even crappier than I thought it was, so.

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Odd1InChat, at chat.onechonserator.com, says,

276
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Dumb shooters FTW, so agrees with your assessment of Ghost Squad.

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay, let me put it this way.

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Ghost Squad, as you play it, you unlock more stuff, like I said, weapons and stuff,

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but later on, I'm not even sure where in the game,

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
but later on, you get it so ridiculous where all the enemies are bikini-clad chicks.

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're shooting a dolphin squirt gun at them instead of an actual gun.

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You can stealth kill somebody instead with a knife, with a banana,

283
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and they're pursuing you in swan-shaped paddle boats instead of jet skis.

284
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean, that's hilarious.

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Suddenly, the chatroom is turned to talk about Ninja Bread Man.

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We have Gerardimo in chat says, Ninja Bread Man FTW.

287
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Odd1 says, I got to love those guys just for the name Ninja Bread Man,

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and ActDeaf descents and says, Ninja Bread Man looks crappy.

289
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I totally need one.

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There you have it.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Anything else you played this week?

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Actually, I did play one thing, but I don't really have much of an impression for it.

293
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Forever Blue, it's an underwater scuba diving sim for the Wii.

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It looks pretty.

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I guess it's sort of like Pokemon Snap.

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Unfortunately, the version I played was all in Japanese,

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and I'm trying to get my hands on an English copy so I can actually understand what's going on.

298
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But you can play your own MP3s on it, like Excite Truck, so that's kind of cool.

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Except the MP3s I had in my cart at the time were from Excite Truck,

300
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
so it didn't really fit the underwater Enya that they have normal playing in the game.

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Instead, I have some rock and roll stuff, like paranoia something.

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It was fine.

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Nice.

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Let's see, so my gaming week then, if you're all finished.

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm done.

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's see, what did I play this week?

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I played a little bit of World of Warcraft.

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I also kind of got sucked back into Final Fantasy XI a little bit.

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've been leveling...

311
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Hi.

312
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hi, Jamie.

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Is there anything you want to say to that?

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hi, Rob.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, I already gave you health for it the other day.

316
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I've been leveling Corsair in Final Fantasy XI, and Corsairs are awesome.

317
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Actually, I've decided that if I'm going to like Final Fantasy XI again,

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am going to not play by the rules,

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
because one thing that totally pissed me off about Final Fantasy XI is that people were like,

320
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
well, if you're a Paladin, you have to sub Warrior, because you have to have Voke,

321
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and if you're a White Mage, you really have to sub Black Mage, or maybe Summoner.

322
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There's all these freaking unsaid rules.

323
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You have to have this equipment.

324
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You have to.

325
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
F that noise.

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I am going to play this game how I want.

327
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Therefore, I am going to be a Corsair Bard, because I like to buff people,

328
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and both those classes are all about buffing people.

329
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Corsairs are awesome because they're based around gambling,

330
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and Bards are awesome because they sing.

331
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Basically, my character is a tacky Las Vegas nightclub act,

332
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
because I gamble and I sing.

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's awesome.

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If I played that again, I would totally play a White Mage Monk.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Good times.

336
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
See, we should just have a party of people playing whatever the hell they want.

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But that makes sense, though, a White Mage and a Monk.

338
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let's see.

339
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Dark Tetsuya says Rob likes to buff people.

340
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Very funny jerk.

341
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What are you laughing at?

342
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, what?

343
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You have an aim chatter with a comment?

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I couldn't read it.

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What's it say?

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Rob likes to buff people.

347
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Buff people.

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Shut up.

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Shut up.

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's see.

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So I've been playing a lot of that.

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I actually took Corsair from level 10 to level 17 in just a matter of days,

353
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
so that should tell you about how much I was playing.

354
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I also was playing on the Nintendo Wii a little bit,

355
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
because I was looking for the Check Me Out channel.

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It wasn't there yet, but I did download Super Mario Bros. 3,

357
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and I was playing a little bit of that, because that is a classic game.

358
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I'll tell you what.

359
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When you play Super Mario Bros. 3,

360
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
if you're playing on a widescreen TV and you have it scrunched in,

361
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
you can see a lot of the graphical glitches that you didn't see back in the day on your regular TV,

362
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
because the sides of the screen were cut off by your TV.

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You know how the old TVs have that rounded-ish screen,

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
so you didn't really see the sides?

365
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There's hella graphical glitches in Super Mario Bros. 3.

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I never really realized.

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I remember there being some, but it's all right.

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's still a fantabulous game, so it's great.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I need to buy Simon's Quest as well.

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think you should bring Super Mario Bros. 3 on...

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, I know they already have it on Game Boy Advance and stuff,

372
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
but do a new version on the DS,

373
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and have it randomly glitch out every now and then,

374
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and you have to blow into your DS microphone to clean the cartridge out.

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That would be great.

376
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That would be the authentic Super Mario Bros. experience.

377
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Jolnir in chat is asking,

378
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What about the new dancer job of Final Fantasy XI?

379
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I am excited for the new jobs.

380
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think scholar and dancer look good.

381
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I hope there's a third one.

382
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I would love to see Geomancer or something,

383
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
but I hear it's not going to happen.

384
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's only going to be the two.

385
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My buddy Shane, who you've probably heard on the show,

386
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know. There's only the two.

387
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They're going to say it's only the two jobs.

388
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Well, dancer and what's the other one?

389
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Scholar is the other one.

390
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What the fuck's scholar?

391
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Scholar was kind of obscure.

392
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I think scholar was in Final Fantasy.

393
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm smart.

394
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Well, that's not going to help you in fighting enemies.

395
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Scholar is a combination of white mage and black mage,

396
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
but they're not a red mage.

397
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They use what's called, I think it's called grimoire or something.

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They use this to basically strengthen the white magic

399
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and weaken the black magic if you use a white scholar or a white grimoire

400
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
or there's the black one that will strengthen the black magic

401
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and weaken the white magic, and they have their own unique spells.

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So there's support for the support?

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Sort of. The rumor is they get the reflect spell.

404
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They're going to have reflect, which is a spell that's missing from the game.

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So then they're going to basically be like the...

406
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
For lack of a better description, like the ones that reflect the enemy.

407
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,440
well look here's what it really is is that the scholar artifact armor which is

408
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,580
like the endgame honor

409
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,500
armor is a school outfit so now you can actually be a Japanese schoolgirl in the

410
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,760
game so that's

411
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,120
that look let's just let's just go to the reality of yay job

412
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,480
Japanese schoolgirls everywhere so I'm guessing that we're gonna see lots of

413
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,360
I'll

414
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,760
damn I've been out of Final Fantasy way too long serious mythra's

415
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,400
too many mythra scholars in schoolgirl outfits

416
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,960
be wonderful anyhow and then they could be

417
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,000
asking for honestly I am looking more forward to galka dancers

418
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
mythra scholar I'm dancers

419
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,360
then that way they can be you know strippers right

420
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,400
enough about a Final Fantasy love it I would say

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm what else I played on xbox I've been playing guitar here we had people over

422
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
here last night because

423
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,000
the night started at John's incredible pizza which is this chain

424
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,360
I think mostly only exists in central California like Fresno I think is where

425
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,880
it started

426
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,000
but now it's up here in Roseville they have one our shows based out of

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,560
Sacramento Roseville being a suburb

428
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,720
I sometimes forget we have people all around the listen so anyway

429
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,880
we're at this John's incredible pizza which is basically like a Dave and Busters for kids

430
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,200
they have a big pizza buffet

431
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,040
and like then they have this game room they actually have rides in the joint

432
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,720
eat this place used to be a Sam's Club and they totally converted into this

433
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
ginormous pizza place

434
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,040
but they have video games and we started the night playing I was playing DDR

435
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,840
Supernova

436
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,400
and my boyfriend William is so hilarious because while I was playing

437
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,120
this like lady in her probably her mid-thirties came up and she was

438
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
watching me play she's like wow

439
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,480
I wanna get this game for my kids and William is like totally selling the lady

440
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,560
on this game he's like

441
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,680
yeah like you see what he's doing is when the arrows go to the top of the

442
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,000
screen he steps on it's just so funny Konami should be paying his so good at

443
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
selling stuff too

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,160
he is he just will make you believe anything

445
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,400
you should have a cult he totally could like sell

446
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,920
like games or anything like William could have his own cult yes

447
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,440
he's great I one of these days I will let him come on the show and so that

448
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,240
would be fantastic he's hilarious

449
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,560
so he was very funny at dinner by the way he's the best he's the best anyway

450
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,040
yeah they're all in central California I need to I need to stop gushing so much

451
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,440
anyway

452
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,880
I here's the other thing about John's Incredible Pizza that I thought was

453
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,560
hilarious is that it pretty much outside of DDR in some random shooter games

454
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,200
it was all ticket games like you know gambling for kids basically right

455
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,080
but my god ticket games have come a long way since I was a kid

456
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,360
like I remember when I was a kid it was all about whack-a-mole like if the

457
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,720
Chuck E. Cheese had whack-a-mole that was the shit right

458
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,640
and like you play that with your hands and stuff not just a big mallet but your friends

459
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,280
would play too

460
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,640
now they have deal or no deal but with tickets

461
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,240
and you actually play this game and like the banker offers you like 50 tickets

462
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,400
to buy out your case or whatever because basically the show but with tickets I

463
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,920
couldn't believe it I was like floored

464
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,320
but then this place had rides in it like it had a roller coaster inside which I

465
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,240
thought was crazy

466
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,520
kind of a fun little place I'm sure they'll do well. Gerardo says deal or no

467
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,200
deal is too expensive to play

468
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Act F says yay gambling is good for you

469
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,760
GS68 says jump in jackpot dude this place had not one

470
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,480
but two jump in jackpot machines and for those in New York City that went when I

471
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,320
was there we had the OLR meetup

472
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,560
I got further in jumping jackpot than I ever have before I don't know if the machine

473
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,840
was set to an easier difficulty

474
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,680
but I got all the way to like the O in jackpot and then I lost I was so

475
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,280
pissed

476
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,960
anyhow jump in jackpot is that jump rope game

477
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,200
with the random eurobeat music that sounds like flame in finger

478
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,800
I've never seen it but I love flame in finger. We are going to this place

479
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,680
but on a weeknight because I was pissed because the place is out of beer mugs

480
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,040
how do you run out of beer mugs

481
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,720
well go after my pay day we will and then I'm gonna buy that t-shirt

482
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,200
awesome the cake is a lie shirt yes good times

483
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,000
so what was I gonna say oh yes so since they were out of beer mugs the idea was to come

484
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,760
back to my place and drink so everybody came over those of us that went out

485
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,920
there's about seven of us that went out

486
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,640
and we came back here we played guitar hero and everybody was learning how to

487
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,680
play William played for the first time and some other people I just met were

488
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,520
playing for the first time we were all having a good time

489
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,560
so guitar hero great party game even though I only have one guitar

490
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,840
but I've been playing through that I finally got some achievements for getting all the five

491
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,720
stars on medium

492
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,920
and now I'm finally working on hard and expert songs and it's hard

493
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,600
you know I could come over one day and bring one of my controllers

494
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,640
you should we should rock out do some co-op be fun

495
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,000
I want rock bands so much and I do want to say this

496
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,920
that Dragonforce song is the fucking shit I'd love that song

497
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,360
seriously but here's the thing I noticed about Dragonforce like I was like so

498
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,000
like

499
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,280
into that song even though playing it sucks like I was so into that song

500
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,400
I went and looked them up on iTunes and seriously all of their songs sound

501
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,840
exactly the same yeah

502
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,360
my friend has about a CD of them they're awesome wait I'm gonna

503
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,680
hold on I'm gonna look them up on the store real quick

504
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,280
and play some of this for you guys I don't know how well it's gonna run

505
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,640
though because we have the webcam going so it's kinda slow

506
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,320
that's pretty much all I want to say about my gaming week

507
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,960
anything anybody else want to add anything on their gaming weeks before we

508
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,040

510
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,840
here's the here's the song from Guitar Hero let me see if this will actually play

511
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,640
it might be too slow and I was trying to sync with my ipod

512
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,800
too

513
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,000
rock

514
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,520
this should be a DDR song doesn't that sound like doesn't that sound like a

515
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,960
song from hell for Guitar Hero okay here is some of their other music

516
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,360
here's a song called operation ground and pound

517
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,200
it's loading give it a moment apparently

518
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,560
pretty much sounds exactly the same right also would be a hellacious song

519
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,280
Guitar Hero

520
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,040
I totally want to drive to this

521
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,480
this is gonna be my custom soundtrack to burn out um okay one more for you guys

522
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,840
revolution death squad

523
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,640
here we go oh god

524
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,840
they really do sound the same

525
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,280
you can make ringtones out of them that's great

526
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I hear though that the drummer is actually drumming that

527
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,720
you know oh god that's so crazy cry for eternity hold on one more

528
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,840
one more this band is awesome

529
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,320
that's cool

530
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,920
well there's a drummer doesn't have to have any talent

531
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,640
I mean wait can you imagine what these concerts must be like

532
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,760
like people die it'd be like a it'd be like a um death clock uh

533
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,840
concert dragon force is like one of my new favorite bands seriously

534
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,360
you hear however I will tell you why Guitar Hero 3 pisses me off as well as

535
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,880
rock band you know why these games piss me off lack of journey you know what I

536
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,640
think that you know what band really needs to be in Guitar Hero

537
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,160
it's freaking dream theater just find something by dream theater

538
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,800
they're great and it's like some of the best

539
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:31,160
guitar in the universe and they're not in Guitar Hero

540
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,920
um azhp says most relaxing game ever plus dragon force equals win

541
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,640
that is the perfect music for you put that in your little like

542
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,920
ocean exploring game

543
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,520
it should be like a katamari game for real um carizzle says I would be all

544
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,800
over a dragon force downloadable content pack for Guitar Hero 3

545
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,000
I refuse to pay the high prices but I would just have to if they came out with

546
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,960
the dragon force pack I bought the foo fighters one what can I

547
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,640
say I like riders what we need to do is we need to do a video segment

548
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,840
crappy games that are made better through dragon force

549
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,960
I love this idea I love this idea I fully support that thought crappy games

550
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,320
made better with the music of dragon force this is a brilliant idea

551
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,960
patent pending nobody better copy that shit because we're going to put it out

552
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,400
there on the internet love it what would be what would be a crappy

553
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,520
game we can make better with with music from dragon force

554
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,040
barbie island princess

555
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,520
actually I don't think that has custom soundtracks is not a 360 but like well

556
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,200
it doesn't matter what game because like you can turn the eva pinata party

557
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,560
animals yes because it has racing fusion frenzy

558
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:49,320
fusion fusion frenzy too oh you know I think that the last really

559
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,600
awful game because you know usually I wait to play a game until I'm sure I'm

560
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,680
really gonna like it I remember renting a game though one time

561
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,600
from blockbuster that was so bad we went back and asked for our money back

562
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,800
and they gave it to us it was one of those uh wrestling games back in the day

563
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,760
ww a thunder I was just I would have liked to have

564
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,160
dragon force would have made that game better remember that game um uh

565
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,480

where we put in like a slow song and it was freaking hard

569
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,080

604
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,800
superstardom but with guitar hero but i'll tell you what the funniest part

605
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,160
was the very end when stan and kyle are finally reunited

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:19,080
reach 1 million points congratulations that's it

610
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,680
now you think i would be offended or something but seriously that shit's

611
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,840
hilarious like i was on the ground laughing

612
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,600
but the funniest part was my roommate walked in and he hadn't seen any of the

613
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,960
episode he just saw like the very end and when he saw that his and he's

614
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,920
watched me play guitar hero like tons throughout the day his jaw was just

615
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,800
like on the ground like i can't believe they just said that

616
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,480
but it was funny i totally want an icon of their expressions in that picture

617
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,320
you are fags that was awesome

618
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,920
anyhow let's get into tonight's oh wait really quickly one more housekeeping

619
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,120
thing i'm so horrible this week marks the fifth

620
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,880
anniversary of xbox live can you believe it november 15th is the day that

621
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,640
xbox live turns five which made me think this week one we're

622
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,640
older than xbox live because we're five and a half years old

623
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,760
but still we were here from the beginning rock on

624
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,040
for xbox live turning five this week and they're doing like all these types of

625
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,120
contests and who knows what other kind of crap

626
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,960
is going to be up on xbox like cool you know uh retrospective stuff and

627
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,280
maybe some new trailers and icons and backgrounds and

628
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,440
i'm sure they're going to celebrate over there

629
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,440
the reason why i say that is that xbox live is very good with the community

630
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,960
you know like out of probably the big three nintendo sony microsoft microsoft

631
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,000
is very good with the community and i think therefore

632
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,320
the community should support them for you know

633
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,600
um reaching out and caring about the independent scene

634
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,320
so hurrah to you guys at xbox speaking of xbox let's get into tonight's gaming

635
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,360
news loki kick it off yes so um the fall updates coming

636
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,360
just might not be for fall um it's actually going to be hitting

637
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:05,560
um on well sometime in december and uh one thing that will be coming with it of

638
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,160
course is the xbox 360 family timer of course that is going to be something

639
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,560
that your parents will be able to use to limit the time that kiddies get to play

640
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,600
um you can limit it down to like two hours

641
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,360
and then after those two hours up they have to play or wait 24 hours before they

642
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,600
can play um their xbox 360 again i think that's an

643
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,160
awesome idea that they're able to limit stuff like

644
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:33,000
that um playtime uh no word though what else

645
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
will be coming um on that update as well but of course

646
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,760
usually with those dashboard updates there's a bit more stuff on there

647
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,000
uh hopefully some more video playback stuff so we can play some divx maybe

648
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,080
xvid that would be nice good times high more high def stuff over the uh

649
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,520
inner or over not the internet but the local network be awesome

650
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,840
then i can watch my dragon force music videos be awesome they have music videos

651
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,880
on itunes there's some for sale and they're just as epic as you'd think

652
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,720
just go to youtube there you go uh last week if you're listening to last

653
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,960
week's show um we were kind of joking uh probably more than we needed to about

654
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,480
kmart remember our kmart and one thing that

655
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,760
came up what we're talking about is that one of the good things that kmart is

656
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,920
there for is that they tend to break street dates and that was totally proven

657
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
this week i would like to see did we call it or

658
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,640
did we call it on last week's show sure enough kmart has been spotted with

659
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,040
copies of mass effect uh kmart sold a copy of mass

660
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,800
effect it looks like in uh cropped in maryland is where they

661
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,040
are still going to be in trouble tomorrow

662
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,960
busted they're gonna get the smackdown on that and i believe that was sold

663
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,960
friday or yesterday uh that's 10 days before the official release date of the

664
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,560
game and of course the guy bought it and

665
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,360
promptly put a picture of it up on the internet with the receipt so you knew he

666
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,040
wasn't full of crap so uh everybody's saying run and check

667
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,360
kmart and see if this is there because you never know

668
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,720

698
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,480
i know but i love radio head but i would like to point out there is still a

699
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,560
distinct lack of journey in this list hey give it time give it

700
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,440
time i want my fucking don't stop believing damn it

701
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,320
maybe they're the ones maybe it's journeys fault of this stuff isn't it

702
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,120
maybe they're like little bitches that don't have their fucking music to be in

703
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
this game now fuck this we remember the journey

704
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,560
game it sucked we're just not gonna put our music in anything radio head

705
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,720
radio head is cool i'll take that radio head well you know i was still on the

706
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,720
fence about rock band and i'm like uh i don't want to spend the 170 on the

707
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,920
game but then i was watching some trailers online last night and

708
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,600
keep in mind i was kind of drunk like we drank a lot last night and we were

709
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,800
having the people over here to guitar hero and we were just all in here

710
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,760
watching the rock band footage going oh we need to get this game it looks so

711
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,560
high i'm definitely getting there i think i'm gonna have to get it my wife

712
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,160
is gonna buy it for me for christmas oh we've already decided to get it

713
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,440
well it looks like we're gonna have our own little band and hopefully i'll have

714
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,240
it early awesome uh odd one says

715
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,880
yes my iron lung is my fave song of the bends that is so spectacular

716
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,960
that is such a good although i have to say overall my my all-time

717
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,640
favorite radio head song is high and dry i know i was gonna say i want high and

718
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,880
dry don't leave me but that wouldn't be so

719
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,800
rock bandy yeah you know what i mean my iron lung is

720
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,560
probably one of the perfect ones to have in that and mac man in our chat room is

721
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,120
urging me to hold on to that feelings guy

722
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,880
i will i will i'm gonna write journeys fan club or something and

723
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,560
and make you know somebody who knows the band that's right

724
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,840
i keep forgetting we know we have a friend who we have a friend journey he

725
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,760
bought he gave me guitar picks from that this to happen if you're listening said

726
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,000
friend i need to have some words with journey

727
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,960
can we make that happen anyhow you get them on the show for real

728
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,000
we should just have a completely night dedicated to the greatest like even

729
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,040
though our show's about video games the hell with it we'll put it aside for a

730
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,200
night and talk to all the great you know guitar

731
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,560
bands we've always wanted to have your special just get random people on just

732
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,760
ask them about games you think these people don't play games i'm sure dragon

733
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,160
force plays a shitload of video games as does

734
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,800
you know journey and all these other bands what else are they going to do on

735
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,320
the road other than heroin anyways um

736
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,840
so as i mentioned last week with rock band of course

737
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,640
there's going to be quite a shortage with rock band this holiday season

738
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,280
and that also will probably be the case with guitar hero 3 in fact

739
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,640
uh during activisions quarterly earnings call

740
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,240
uh company ceo robert cotic said that there's probably there's a

741
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,840
probability that this holiday we won't be able to supply all the demand for

742
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,520
every platform while a probability isn't quite on

743
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,880
par with of course the you know comment from

744
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,760
ea saying that there's really not going to be a lot out there

745
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,960
um there's a pretty good chance it's going to be hard to find

746
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,160
and from the other side that i you know of course

747
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,000
my work side i can definitely say that there's one hell of a shortage on

748
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,400
guitar hero already so don't be surprised there's a part of me that

749
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,360
can't help but wonder if this is a little bit intentional you know what i

750
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,480
mean like isn't it just a coincidence that rock band is going to be in short

751
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,720
supply and i'll tell you why short supply i'll

752
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:19,000
tell you why they're like that and it's only in short supply um in one

753
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,240
one way because the bundles that come with the new guitars

754
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,320
are in short supply it's because these new designs for the guitars and stuff

755
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,200
don't get finalized until it's too late same reason with rock band that's why

756
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,800
the bundle for rock band is hard to find or going to

757
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,240
be hard to find because they didn't finalize the design until it's too late

758
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,240
same with um guitar hero 3 one thing that they're doing to kind of to help

759
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,200
alleviate this if you don't give a shit about having a wireless guitar

760
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,880
they will sell specialized bundles for retailers that

761
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,080
come with the explorer guitar from guitar hero 2

762
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,760
those are going to be readily available but it's just getting the game with that

763
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,200
new guitar is going to be hard to find so if you don't care about having a new

764
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
guitar i mean because to be honest it's wireless

765
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,240
big deal you know the wired one works just fine

766
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,240
but you know if that's the case then get the game by itself by guitar later

767
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,120
but that that's the thing that's why it's because of these new instruments

768
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,640
and i bet you anything if they change the design of the guitar for guitar hero

769
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,440
4 we're going to be talking about this all over again so that's why

770
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,280
well thank you for that report well uh if you have guitar hero 3 there's

771
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,920
already some downloadable content available for it like i mentioned

772
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,560
earlier i downloaded the foo fighters pack for the game

773
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,400
uh that is up and running when the foo fighters pack has the pretender

774
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,680
all my life and the classic this is a call it was like the very first single i

775
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,000
think although you know what it was sadly

776
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,920
missing was a ever long but i think that song was in guitar hero 2 so i think

777
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,600
that's why b big me that's that song was awesome it

778
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,400
had the mentos in the video remember that back when mtv

779
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,080
played videos velvet revolver also has a pack of their

780
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,040
own i didn't buy it yet because i'm not as familiar with velvet revolver but

781
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,960
maybe i i hear they actually put trailers on xbox live of these packs

782
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,080
so you could hear the songs beforehand which is great i think it was a great

783
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,200
way to kind of answer that demand of we want to hear this shit before we buy it

784
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,360
so props to microsoft for getting around that um but velvet revolver if you uh do

785
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,120
want to buy that if you're a fan of the band

786
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,760
because i do believe velvet revolver is the band that's made up of it wasn't

787
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,000
that stone temple pilots plus uh the guy from sound garden

788
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,440
i do believe that chris cornell chris cornell has

789
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,160
or my had a difference in my group band sorry i haven't been following my rock

790
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,760
bands very well no maybe i'm gonna get yelled at by chat i think it was i think

791
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,480
chris cornell had a different band but i think it was somebody else that was in

792
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,680
sound garden i want to say all right well if you get

793
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,480
velvet revolver it's uh she builds quick machines

794
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,080
slither and messages are the bands that you will or the songs you will get in

795
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,720
the velvet revolver pack the um packs are 500 microsoft points

796
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,280
which you will remember was a bit controversial because that's how much

797
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,560
they charge for the old packs but now when you consider these games

798
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,240
haven't been in the game before and they are actually downloadable songs

799
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,480
you're not you're not unlocking shit that's already on the disc

800
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,920
velvet revolver is members of guns and roses oh shit

801
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,320
and uh scott wayland who the oh okay i had i had it the other way around or

802
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,480
something what the hell am i thinking of they had

803
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,280
the guy from sound garden chris cornell audio slave that was damn it

804
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,520
because i was like yeah he has a different band although

805
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,600
anyway sorry my bad

806
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,960
look i listen to pop music all right it's gonna mention one thing real quick

807
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,160
unless it's dragon force or journey since the story didn't make it into the

808
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,440
um show role sure it was too late uh the we

809
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,280
guitar hero 3 it only outputs in mono go

810
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,280
monophonic sound go nintendo ouch actually it's probably

811
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,320
activation yay mono

812
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,280
well

813
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,920
well there is something for anyone who is uh looking forward to playing guitar

814
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:01,160
hero 3 on the pc is the 360s wireless um les paul controller will work

815
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,400
on the pc it's not officially supported but it will work you just need the xbox

816
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,360
360 wireless gaming receiver um however um the pc version is

817
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,120
not uh it actually already comes out with a guitar

818
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:24,760
with the gibson explorer um but i guess if you want to do two player

819
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,000
here you go well that makes sense i mean considering

820
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,320
that you know they're just controllers and i could see

821
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,320
why they wouldn't of course add the um wireless gaming

822
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,120
receiver with it you know might as well do the wired version

823
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:44,440
so well the other thing though um i i actually um when we were at best

824
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,160
buy i think it was we actually saw a two guitar pack

825
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:53,320
for um guitar hero 3 yeah and i think that it would be pointless for them to

826
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,760
not release the same kind of pack for pc as well

827
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,520
i mean really there's so many like usb guitars out there now with you know

828
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,280
guitar hero just find one that you want and then buy it

829
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,000
well the explorer controller was kind of ugly

830
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,440
plus they figure you know that you you're buying all these games your

831
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,680
friends probably own some of the games you're gonna play two player if your

832
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,320
friend you come over have them bring their own guitar

833
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,280
i would like for you to spend more vyog

834
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,280
i'm sorry the les paul is a lot more hot um well

835
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,560
this is kind of going back a couple months but uh people might remember that

836
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,680
there were some issues with the wide screen in um

837
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,200
the xbox 360 version of bioshock well 2k is going to be fixing these

838
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,560
problems very soon with the next update that's going to be coming out so

839
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,720
all you people can stop bitching about it although i think a lot of people have

840
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,080
stopped bitching about it and moved on to other games like halo 3 and

841
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,120
games are possibly coming out next week so

842
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,880
i don't know but bioshock is still a great game oh yeah it's an awesome game

843
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,640
yeah highly recommend playing through it at

844
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,080
least once the only reason people will probably be opting for halo 3 instead is

845
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,960
because the multiplayer that's the one thing bioshock unfortunately was missing

846
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,920
it needed it could have used some multiplayer that would have been pretty

847
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,560
cool bioshock 2 you have to have something for

848
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,320
bioshock 2 right yeah well speaking of halo 3 which a lot of

849
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,680
people are turning to you might remember a few weeks ago we

850
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,760
talked about actually it's probably about a couple months ago at this point

851
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,200
we talked about the guy who uh sent the marriage proposal in viva pinata

852
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,160
and i'm sure we've had i think there was the story of the marriage proposal in

853
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,520
world of warcraft well now we have a story tonight about

854
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,080
a halo 3 marriage proposal yes it was somebody using the forge uh

855
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,400
the map editor inside halo 3 to lay down guns and swords

856
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,920
in the shape of the words marry me question mark

857
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,640
very cute what was the answer i'm assuming it was yes but we don't know

858
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,000
all we really know is the screenshot the answer was boom headshot

859
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,200
yes she said yes and then promptly shot him in the head and then

860
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,800
proceeded to hump his corpse the end which might be like the honeymoon who

861
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,720
knows uh anyway la la la la la la la la la

862
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,920
the xbox user was movie sign and he was proposing to his longtime girlfriend

863
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,520
for it furtive penguin

864
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,960
i love xbox live names i don't know why it came up the other night but somebody

865
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,320
was suggesting i changed my xbox live tag to sergeant sausage and i actually

866
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,560
kind of like that name that's cool you should totally do that

867
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:32,360
if it's getting taken yeah if nobody the news for the next step though is they

868
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,320
need to do a custom game no time limit and then have the actual

869
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,600
wedding procession in game there you go hey you can get

870
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,720
married in ragnarok so if you're a real halo 3 fan that's

871
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,280
what you're going to do right i guess i i don't know you know if

872
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,560
you're a real halo 3 fan you're gonna play halo 3 i guess i know you're not

873
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,720
you're not going to go out and do anything else just gonna play halo all

874
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,880
day well speaking of which there is some

875
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:06,040
download content that uh bungee has uh given us some information on

876
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,240
well not us directly but they've just given it you know they give it up

877
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,160
anyway um there are some uh maps that are going to be coming to the xbox live

878
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,400
marketplace uh one of them is the ok corral

879
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,800
which um is described as an asymmetrical medium-sized map so

880
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,120
it's got so you can fight at high noon at the ork corral

881
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,400
i guess so a little silly in your armor whatever

882
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,280
and then there's a one called a purple rain spelled r-e-i-g-n

883
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:45,240
and joe drallbank and then vandalay which is a simple map

884
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,000
so anyway anyway you know what um when you say that map is

885
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,920
called purple rain you know what that makes me think of

886
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,680
yeah i think that was not a good movie no matter what anyone says

887
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,040
prince is still awesome even if he's gone like crazy in the past five years

888
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,000
now he's like suing his fans but how wait wait wait wait what he's

889
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,720
like suing these websites that use pictures

890
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,280
of him it's like his fan websites but they use pictures of him

891
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,440
and like tattoos of of him and his symbols and stuff

892
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,800
because he owns them but they're like fan sites why would you bite the hand

893
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,200
that feeds you because you're crazy yeah because he's

894
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,400
crazy but still he wrote purple rain and come on tell me

895
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,800
you do not want to play halo with this as a custom soundtrack

896
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:43,800
everybody purple rain no do not want

897
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,040
i actually do like that failed uh let's see well what you might be able

898
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:54,360
to be doing um pretty soon is chocolate rain

899
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:59,880
h master osha says i guess better than chocolate rain have you heard the song

900
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,160
i don't want to hear that yeah i've heard chocolate rain i actually saw the

901
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,600
live performance of chocolate rain yeah i don't care there's a guy at my

902
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,320
work that he was telling everybody about it and he started singing it in his

903
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,680
cubicle and i thought it was the most hilarious freaking thing i'd ever heard

904
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:16,440
and then that's how i heard about it act deaf says vampire rain

905
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,560
no okay anyways the rain no what one game that has something that rains from

906
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,040
the sky that's pretty cool which would be fire

907
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,520
is boom boom rocket and yes they're adding a bunch of support for dance pads

908
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,240
and guitars so you can actually play the game with

909
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,960
those as well um other things that they're going to be

910
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,400
fixing as well adding some japanese and korean language support

911
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,200
uh tweaking the scoring system a little bit to focus only on accuracy

912
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,880
and i guess there's a huge loud noise which

913
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,640
popped up occasionally on endurance that they've fixed

914
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,240
um some other fun things they uh have another problem with display

915
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,400
updates when viewing through a vga cable

916
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,400
um they've added some stuff the friends leaderboard now shows extra information

917
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,360
such as grade and accuracy etc um multiplayer endurance mode

918
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,360
fix for players color swapping sporadically

919
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,440
and slightly bigger and better explosions

920
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,000
you gotta love an update that adds bigger explosions

921
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,440
oh tell me it's gonna have a chorus in here

922
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,520
all i can find was a bad karaoke version of this song

923
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,320
ah i was trying to do blame it on the rain this this sucks

924
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,400
i ruined the show i'm sorry they didn't have the original milli vanilli version

925
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,480
though on itunes go figure why wouldn't they sell that

926
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,880
that's a classic i'm i see how they have a karaoke version i know they have a

927
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,160
karaoke version which sucks obviously because nobody knew what the hell i was

928
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,720
trying to play joke i don't know what you're doing

929
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:01,000
you live radio oh my god marissa's in the chat room

930
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,760
hi marissa ah i'm so happy let's move on when was the last time

931
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,600
she was on the show most people was on the show a long time

932
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,240
ago need to come back tell us some more of

933
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,280
your stories marissa come back on the show okay and

934
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,920
then do the russian lady uh bra story uh

935
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,280
loki have you tried boom boom rocket with a guitar yet nope i might i just

936
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,200
might have to try that that sounds like fun

937
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,640
i saw the youtube edge though of the developers playing it pretty funny

938
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,320
good times ddr might be interesting but i can only play that game if it was like

939
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,840
actually set up like ddr how about ddr and the guitar at the same time

940
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,440
omg name uh if you have not yet checked out two

941
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,600
worlds because the very mixed reviews on it well there's now a demo available on

942
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,960
the xbox live marketplace so you can check that out it's a demo of

943
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,760
two worlds of course this is a game that's supposed to kind of

944
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,640
cater to the fans of oblivion but it's supposed to be you know bigger better

945
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,080
and better and it has multiplayer well their problem was saying it's the most

946
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,560
ultimate like best rpg ever you know that that was a

947
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,040
problem they shouldn't have marketed as the best

948
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,120
game ever but unfortunately the game had some flaws but fear not

949
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,120
uh south peak has said that they are currently making a patch

950
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,080
and supposed to be out very soon for two worlds and it's going to address more

951
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,760
than 50 different bugs and other issues in the game so

952
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,280
awesome i'm glad that you released the game with 50 plus bugs in it

953
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,520
way to go south peak shit what is wrong with these people

954
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:33,240
oh look we found 50 bugs later on you know i could understand if we found

955
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,360
two bugs or something like that but 50 come on that's just lazy

956
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,600
good times not buggy enough we don't want it oh but don't worry

957
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,640
the i'm sure the playstation 3 version will be coming out soon

958
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,360
oh talk about bugs there well anyway how about something that's a little bit more

959
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,320
cool for uh people with the ipod who want ipod

960
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:59,240
games harmonix is giving us phase which is um pretty much a very low

961
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,480
graphical given it's a ipod um version sort of of uh i guess it

962
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,360
plays sort of like guitar hero is supposed to but it's

963
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,680
tutor frequency yeah it's this they all are like the same freaking

964
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,120
sort of game essentially in terms of their gameplay

965
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:23,320
um but it's you your songs will interface with

966
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,640
the stuff so i'm probably going to download it yeah that's cool because

967
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,400
you can use your own songs with it on my iphone it's kind of fun can you play the

968
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,480
games on your iphone i'm sure i can cool i thought you would need the wheel

969
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,720
though to play but i guess yeah because you have the touch screen

970
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,920
it might still work you i think you do need the wheel for that oh

971
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,120
then crap give me some iphone games people

972
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,560
i can play it on mine i haven't well i still have an ipod and dark tetsuya

973
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,640
says you could play a dragon force on it heck yeah actually yeah the the phase

974
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,520
kind of looks like frequency and amplitude and all that stuff but it has

975
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,640
some zigzag stuff like it looks like you can drag back and forth

976
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,080
which i imagine you know using the dial um you could do

977
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,960
but that kind of came out of nowhere didn't it nobody knew this game was

978
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,840
coming but kind of interesting because nobody's

979
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,520
ever really taking ipod gaming that seriously because most of them have just

980
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,440
been ports of like cell phone games but this is kind of a big step i think

981
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,400
between this and some of the other recent releases they have been on the

982
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,480
i like the stepped up music quiz games like 99 cents and some of the other

983
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,240
stuff that's really taken off ipod might be a uh legitimate gaming platform

984
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,480
we need i'm sorry i'm sorry what'd you just say

985
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,520
ipod legitimate game platform we need we need iphone games

986
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,600
official ones i do agree that they do need is not official

987
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,240
true i don't want to brick my phone i mean because if you paid a couple

988
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,440
hundred dollars for a fucking phone you better have something that plays games

989
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:47,480
on it seriously but i do have the youtube

990
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,560
channel and the youtube channel makes everything better

991
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,000
give me a youtube channel and we that'd be cool anyways

992
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,320
um so something that's kind of sad i guess for some people in the media

993
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,480
would be that uh the npd group is going to be withholding their hardware sales

994
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,880
numbers stuff from the media and so they won't know exactly what

995
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:13,320
consoles are selling and stuff like that so sad oh wait

996
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,480
that won't affect me at all so are you going to continue to report the numbers

997
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,840
to us here on the show like yeah i will awesome so yeah so sad

998
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,880
but no not that it really matters anyways because it's fucking console

999
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,160
sale numbers i mean they'll have some stupid press release

1000
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,120
that each company will release you because you know sony nintendo and

1001
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,000
microsoft are not going to shut up about it and obviously they're going to you

1002

1004
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,920

um life science hospital affairs on ds nba 2k8 portal on ps3

1057
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,480

2 playstation 3 the orange box playstation 3

1063
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,760
warriors of the lost empire i'm guessing those are probably just all in the

1064
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,120
orange box and they probably just listen to separate as well

1065
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,240
well i think no i think that they actually are getting separate sales and

1066
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,640
then you get them bundled as the orange box

1067
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,520
that's weird i don't know why they would do that

1068
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,480
the only game in that whole pack i care about is portal

1069
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,200

01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,920
don't think it's coming out on the ds lies it is coming out soon though on the

1145
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,480
we and ds well one thing that will not be coming

1146
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,760
to your local target is manhunt 2 you might remember last week we were talking

1147
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,920
about the uh rumors about the ban going on for target 2 because of the uh

1148
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,880
hack remember we talked about that last week well a

1149
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,720
official word has been put out from target about the official ban yes it is

1150
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,120
true target will not be carrying manhunt 2

1151
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,960
quote target strives to provide merchandise that will appeal to a wide

1152
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,440
variety of guests we also want guests to be comfortable

1153
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,520
with the purchasing decisions they make at target

1154
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,720
all video games and computer software sold at target currently carry ratings

1155
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,600
by the esrb from early childhood through mature

1156
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,360
audiences while manhunt 2 was given a mature rating by the esrb

1157
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,400
we received additional information that players can potentially view

1158
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,400
previously filtered content by altering the game code as a result we've decided

1159
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:55,720
not to carry the game because i'm sure the millions of people

1160
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:58,600
that shop at target know how to do this to hack their psp to

1161
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,440
unlock all the content i don't know about you guys i think

1162
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,280
it's a little silly but i guess it's their choice people get

1163
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,720
at other places apparently target doesn't like money

1164
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,920
i guess not although then again how many people i mean is manhunt 2 really going

1165
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,760
to be that big a big seller it's it's more

1166
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:17,800
it's one of those games that's kind of all talk you know what i mean it is all

1167
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,640
talk well still this and this news about a

1168
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,680
manhunt 2 makes me very angry i don't know about you guys but i get very

1169
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,320
angsty when i hear about this kind of censorship

1170
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,720

1183
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,880

1186
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,120
then well for uh people who've been keeping

1187
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,880
up with the news on the max pain movie 20th century fox

1188
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,960
has asked mark walberg to be in it and he said okay

1189
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:59,160
at least that's what we're hearing so far

1190
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:04,760
so um i think it would be cool with him in it i mean he's a good actor

1191
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:09,000
better than his rap career he was pretty good in the party as an angry cop and

1192
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,880
he's also good in the wee on the night as an angry cop so

1193
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,240
he was great in this movie and in this movie where he plays an angry cop it

1194
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,840
should work so yeah i think he's got the angry cop

1195
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,040
roll down anyways um akira yamoko is actually working on a

1196
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,400
brand new game series of course it's untitled yet

1197
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,600
but uh glad to know that he's moving beyond

1198
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,680
um silent hill at least i think he's moving on

1199
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:40,760
beyond silent hill could be silent hill the musical maybe

1200
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:45,240
that'd be awesome no but uh no idea what kind of game it is

1201
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,720
what platform it is but he says that should be announced soon

1202
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:54,600
so it's coming soon but if it's coming from akira yamoko like seriously how

1203
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,720
can it be bad if you can't really be bad but yeah

1204
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,960
i don't know i kind of feel left out with uh konami right now

1205
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,640
you know no summer event that they did because they were moving offices and

1206
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:12,280
stuff makes me sad all right

1207
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,040
well we're just about to the end of our part a tonight

1208
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,640
the first half of tonight's program we always like to close part a by

1209
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:22,200
respecting our elders a little bit the way we do that

1210
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,200
is by acknowledging the classic game of the week as selected by our the one and

1211
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,200
only dark sakura so dark sakura is going to

1212
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,480
dig through the archives and find a game that she thinks

1213
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:38,120
you guys need to check out it's the classic game of the week

1214
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,400
dark soccer what is this week's pick for the classic game of the week

1215
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,360
i've brought this game up several times and it's just about damn time i said

1216
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,320
something about it um today's game of the week is blazing

1217
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:52,120
star for the neo geo very cool and we actually will play some

1218
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:57,160
clips from blazing star i'm trying to get into some actual gameplay here

1219
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,760
and the intro is all um you know rendered pretty and everything but the

1220
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,560
game itself is um it's for the most part 2d with some

1221
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:14,120
cg so it's pretty pretty sweet and um it's

1222
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,440
basically like i think side schooling shooter um it's actually fairly

1223
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:23,240
uh it's the sequel to polestar and polestar was a good game but blazing

1224
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,400
star is just really really good and um it's actually

1225
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:33,080
related to our type in its family but not quite you know what was that

1226
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,120
fetus looking thing it turned into a star or something that

1227
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,640
was weird it's weirdo storyline imagine star baby

1228
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:48,600
i guess so anyway um it has a lot of you know uh

1229
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:53,320
cut scenes and you know as you can hear a lot of talk wow this is like fun

1230
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:58,040
oh my god this game is terrific log i'm gonna put this on a virtual console i

1231
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,600
hope so i've never played it better well you know

1232
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:04,600
what where i um i had actually played this um quite a bit when i lived in

1233
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,760
alabama and i was very sad because the machine that i played it on was

1234
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,240
actually broken into and the uh cartridge stolen out of it ouch it was

1235
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:18,920
one of those multi avs machines um but anyway um

1236
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,680
crust view lanes in sacramento they have this

1237
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,920
they had it ah and they closed they closed down their arcade to put in the

1238
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,800
pro shop dang but this is the boss coming yep

1239
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,400
what is the boss here sure we're gonna listen to some music

1240
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:40,920
boss music oh it's like a spider mech thing gross

1241
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,440
oh you're you're timed on the bosses i noticed yeah you are turned on the

1242
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,840
bosses and if you don't beat them within the

1243
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,720
time limit you still progress but you don't get the points for beating the

1244
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,040
boss huh that's kind of different very cool

1245
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,720
and if i'm right i think it takes life wow

1246
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:04,280
you beat it your skill is great that's the congratulatory you also um

1247
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,720
collect um letters as you go through and it gives you more um

1248
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:11,000
power ups and bonuses as you go through the game awesome um

1249
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:17,000
but it is basically you have um a fire button and you have a bomb button

1250
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:23,320
and you have charged attacks so it's very very very very cool

1251
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,320
good times and people complain that blazing star was sort of you know dumb

1252
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:32,120
down for its difficulty from pole star i disagree blazing star is still pretty

1253
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,720
damn hard once you get past the first few stages

1254
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:40,920
but it's just really i think that my favorite ship to play in

1255
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,800
that game is the green one all right i don't know the graphics in

1256
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,760
this game for some reason i don't know why it reminds me a little bit of un

1257
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:53,160
squadron just this art style for some reason i don't know what it is a

1258
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,640
little bit but um on top of that it was actually one

1259
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,520
of the larger neo geo roms oh wow it was a 346 megabyte one because

1260
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,000
of all the where did all that go well um it was

1261
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,320
mostly um for the uh the pre-rendered uh 3d and there are

1262
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:12,840
sprites that they were pre-rendered all right very cool blazing star is your

1263
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,880
classic video game of the week of the neo geo game is freaking awesome

1264
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,720
