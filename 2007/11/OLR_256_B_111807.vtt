00:15.000 --> 00:19.500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.700
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, November the 18th of 2007.

00:25.700 --> 00:29.700
By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast, it'll probably be Thanksgiving time,

00:29.700 --> 00:34.700
so to all of our fellow American listeners, happy Thanksgiving and hope you're having a good day today.

00:34.700 --> 00:39.500
To all of our non-American listeners, happy Thursday whenever that happens to fall for you.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.200
Alright, let's go back into the gaming news.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.700
Loki, happy Thursday from wherever that happens to fall.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.500
Because I'm thinking in my mind Thanksgiving, never mind, I'm out of it tonight.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.200
I think Thursday lands on the same time of the week each week.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.200
Anyways, not when you have the international dateline involved, okay?

00:55.200 --> 00:58.700
It's still the same time each week, their time.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.200
Shut up, I hate you.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.700
So, another reason I guess people are kind of bitter, you know, Club Nintendo,

01:04.700 --> 01:07.200
this wonderful little program that they have in Japan,

01:07.200 --> 01:11.700
where they get a bunch of cool free shit that we don't ever see anywhere else around the world.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.700
Well, they're getting something else that's pretty cool,

01:14.700 --> 01:18.700
a Super Famicom controller that is actually a classic controller.

01:18.700 --> 01:24.200
So you can use this to play your wonderful Super Nintendo or Super Famicom games using the Wii.

01:24.200 --> 01:28.700
And it is authentic, so yeah, you can get that.

01:28.700 --> 01:33.700
Also, other items of note, they have a Mario Galaxy soundtrack,

01:33.700 --> 01:36.700
including 81 tracks from the game across two CDs.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.700
Jesus, 81?

01:38.700 --> 01:42.700
And two 2008 tabletop calendars.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.700
Of course, you know, if you want these, you have to,

01:46.700 --> 01:50.700
you know, you have until December 2nd to select one of the above items.

01:50.700 --> 01:56.200
But anyways, according to IGN's translation of the site,

01:56.200 --> 01:59.700
those Famicom controllers are going to be delivered by April 2008.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.700
But still, though, I think those are pretty cool.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.700
Too bad we don't have anything like that over here.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.700
I know, that's very cool.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.700
Why don't they do that over here, you think?

02:10.700 --> 02:14.700
Is it just a money thing? Too many people would get in on it or what?

02:14.700 --> 02:17.700
Why can't they just do like a contest or something silly?

02:17.700 --> 02:19.700
I don't know. They don't like us?

02:19.700 --> 02:20.700
I guess.

02:20.700 --> 02:25.700
Well, God, we buy their freaking Wii's even though they haven't put out that many games this year to support it.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.700
We've stood by them.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.700
We should get something out of it, don't you think?

02:29.700 --> 02:30.700
Nope.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.700
I guess not, jerks.

02:33.700 --> 02:39.700
Alright, well, I'll just continue to play the Virtual Console games with the thing they have out there.

02:39.700 --> 02:45.700
Well, remember how we said in Part A that usually if peripherals only get like one game to go with them,

02:45.700 --> 02:48.700
then they won't continue to be supported and they'll be pretty much deemed a failure?

02:48.700 --> 02:53.700
Well, what's interesting is that there do appear to be some other games coming on board with an upcoming peripheral,

02:53.700 --> 02:56.700
and that is the Wii Balance Board.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.700
It's coming out, I believe, early next year with Wii Fitness.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.700
A new game has been announced that will use the Wii Balance Board.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.700
It's Namco Bandai's Family Ski.

03:05.700 --> 03:10.700
Famitsu has recently revealed this game and it will be compatible with the Wii Balance Board.

03:10.700 --> 03:12.700
Notice that's compatible, not required,

03:12.700 --> 03:17.700
but certainly it does look like you'll get to use, you know, Mii-like characters in the game.

03:17.700 --> 03:18.700
For your own Mii's.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.700
With skiing.

03:20.700 --> 03:25.700
The game is supposedly going to come out winter of this year or 2008 even in Japan.

03:25.700 --> 03:30.700
So kind of interesting the game may actually be out in Japan before the Wii Fit board actually is out.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.700
So, kind of cool.

03:32.700 --> 03:37.700
Kind of like how we have DualShock 3 support for PlayStation 3 games over here.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.700
Even though the controllers don't come out until the spring.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.700
Yeah.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.700
Odd1InChat says, oh man.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.700
By the way, chat.orangemonstrator.com, we always love our chatters.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.700
The ever-present fourth host on our show.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.700
Odd1 says, oh man, the Wii Balance Board is going to be the best way to randomly tackle friends and loved ones ever.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.700
What?

03:56.700 --> 03:58.700
That might be kind of scary, I don't know.

03:58.700 --> 04:05.700
I was going to say that they're also going to have a game in Wii Fit that's going to be a skiing or snowboarding game

04:05.700 --> 04:07.700
that's going to use the Balance Board as well.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.700
So wait, are we just going to see a lot of knock-offs of those type of games?

04:10.700 --> 04:12.700
Kind of like we've been seeing in Wii Sports.

04:12.700 --> 04:17.700
Suddenly there's all these golf games and, you know, tennis games.

04:17.700 --> 04:21.700
Well, it's just like when Wii Play came out, hey, we can do shooting gallery type games in this?

04:21.700 --> 04:23.700
Okay, let's make a bunch of them.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.700
They all suck.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.700
Yay.

04:27.700 --> 04:34.700
Hey, there's nothing wrong with another skiing game using it because it's going to be a full fleshed out version of skiing.

04:34.700 --> 04:41.700
Now, Namco Bandai is a pretty respected third-party publisher that's not known for doing a lot of these type of knock-off games.

04:41.700 --> 04:45.700
Now, certain third-party publishers are kind of known for being nothing but a bunch of knock-off games.

04:45.700 --> 04:51.700
It's not really Namco Bandai unless they're knocking themselves off or ripping themselves off with Katamari.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.700
But you know what I mean.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.700
I think the game will be fine.

04:57.700 --> 05:02.700
Well, this is actually something else I think a lot of people are looking forward to on Wii.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.700
Okami will be on Wii.

05:05.700 --> 05:14.700
And it will, excuse me, that wasn't fun.

05:14.700 --> 05:25.700
But basically, for the folks at Capcom, they had actually been asked if Okami was going to have a Wii release before the PS2 version even came out.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.700
So they were already thinking about it.

05:27.700 --> 05:32.700
And so they're going to bring it out.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.700
That's one of those games I always wanted to play but I just kind of missed when it first came out.

05:36.700 --> 05:40.700
So this will give me an opportunity to rediscover it all over again on the Wii.

05:40.700 --> 05:51.700
Well, they're also going to be doing a few little tweaks to the game, some gameplay touches, and it will be 16 to 9 ratio.

05:51.700 --> 05:52.700
Oh, now that's cool.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.700
That's right, because the original game wasn't widescreen, so very nice.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.700
And Wii like widescreen.

05:57.700 --> 05:58.700
Absolutely.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.700
Especially me, since I have a TV.

06:00.700 --> 06:05.700
And you know those TVs are going to be more and more out there as this Christmas goes on.

06:05.700 --> 06:10.700
Because that should be a big seller this year now that HD TVs are getting more and more affordable.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.700
I think you're going to see more and more houses have those.

06:12.700 --> 06:20.700
So it will be kind of interesting to see the gaming scene kind of have to evolve to catch up with that and all the games supporting widescreen.

06:20.700 --> 06:22.700
We're looking at you, Nintendo.

06:22.700 --> 06:23.700
That's right.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.700
And your 480p HD.

06:26.700 --> 06:35.700
Well, if you're looking for some Nintendo Wiis, Nintendo is churning out 1.8 million Wiis per month.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.700
Of course, that is split up worldwide.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.700
And will continue to do so until the drought is over.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.700
Yay!

06:42.700 --> 06:44.700
What does that mean, though?

06:44.700 --> 06:46.700
Will you see more Wiis in the stores?

06:46.700 --> 06:47.700
Probably not.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.700
It means no price drop and no new colors, because the ones that are already out there are selling.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.700
Yay!

06:54.700 --> 06:57.700
Wait.

06:57.700 --> 06:58.700
No price drop.

06:58.700 --> 07:02.700
I don't think you need a price drop yet, unless your system is, like, sucking.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.700
That's when you start dropping the price of your system.

07:04.700 --> 07:09.700
Drunami in Chat says beatings will continue until morale improves.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.700
Yay!

07:11.700 --> 07:14.700
Coming out for a play soon on those Wiis.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.700
Skate or Die is coming out on the virtual console.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.700
I love Skate or Die!

07:19.700 --> 07:28.700
It's on its way to the Australian virtual console, but surely if it's coming to Australia, it must be coming to other regions soon, right?

07:28.700 --> 07:33.700
The way we know it's coming to Australia, because just like things get spoiled by the ESRB over here,

07:33.700 --> 07:41.700
the Office of Film and Literature Classifications database showed a re-rating of Skate or Die for the virtual console.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.700
Awesome.

07:42.700 --> 07:46.700
And I know over here we're getting Air Zonk on Monday, or Super Air Zonk.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.700
How did you find that out?

07:48.700 --> 07:49.700
Did you have Wiis?

07:49.700 --> 07:54.700
No, actually, because they announced it on, I believe, the TurboGrafx-

07:54.700 --> 07:57.700
There's some, like, TurboGrafx-16 site that lists a bunch of this crap.

07:57.700 --> 07:58.700
Nice.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.700
It was officially announced, so.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.700
I think we should get that and Skate or Die here.

08:01.700 --> 08:02.700
That would be an awesome week.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.700
Hudson, I'm sure, did it.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.700
What do you think they'll give us for Christmas on a virtual console?

08:07.700 --> 08:10.700
I mean, they could give me Guardian Legend, but I somehow don't think that would happen.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.700
I don't know. Have they made a Shrek game on the Super Nintendo?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.700
Oh, no, I don't think so.

08:14.700 --> 08:15.700
You know what I want?

08:15.700 --> 08:16.700
What?

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
Kirby's Avalanche.

08:17.700 --> 08:21.700
Isn't that- get Dr. Bean Machine or whatever.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.700
But it actually plays differently on the Super Nintendo.

08:24.700 --> 08:25.700
That'd be pretty funny.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.700
I'm a whore for Puyo Puyo.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.700
Wait, I want to say Kirby's Avalanche is out there.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.700
I'm getting it mixed up with a golf game.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.700
They should have, well, maybe kind of find 1080.

08:34.700 --> 08:35.700
Remember that?

08:35.700 --> 08:37.700
What about 720?

08:37.700 --> 08:41.700
Fuck 720. 1080 was a snowboarding game.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.700
I know, but 720 was a skateboarding game. What's your point?

08:43.700 --> 08:45.700
It wasn't a very good skateboarding game.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.700
It was an awesome skateboarding game!

08:46.700 --> 08:47.700
Oh, yeah.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.700
You got killed by bees.

08:49.700 --> 08:50.700
Oh, okay.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.700
That's awesome.

08:51.700 --> 08:52.700
That makes it all better.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.700
Yes, it does.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.700
It's got bees in it now, so.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.700
Okay, Act F says Kirby's Avalanche is already on the Virtual Console.

08:58.700 --> 08:59.700
You missed it.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.700
I didn't see it.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.700
You were sleeping that day.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.700
This is what I get for not playing my Wii for, you know, two weeks.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.700
So Act F says both those games are out.

09:06.700 --> 09:07.700
Kirby's Dream Course.

09:07.700 --> 09:08.700
But you know what?

09:08.700 --> 09:11.700
I don't really look at a lot of them so much because I actually have Kirby's Avalanche

09:11.700 --> 09:15.700
and a Super Nintendo, but I still kind of want to play it on my Wii.

09:15.700 --> 09:16.700
Well, there you have it.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.700
Christmas comes early for you this year.

09:18.700 --> 09:19.700
Yay!

09:19.700 --> 09:20.700
But no, I want Guardian Legend.

09:20.700 --> 09:25.700
And if they're doing Sega games, then I freaking want Fantasy Zone.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.700
Oh, that would be kind of cool.

09:28.700 --> 09:29.700
Fantasy Zone.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.700
Because the Genesis, all you needed was the Power Base Converter to play Master System

09:33.700 --> 09:34.700
games on it so it could do it.

09:34.700 --> 09:38.700
You know what game they'll probably give us for Christmas?

09:38.700 --> 09:42.700
Huge selling Nintendo game that Nintendo made.

09:42.700 --> 09:48.460
Big court battle over the rights to the game because somebody else put an off-color version

09:48.460 --> 09:51.700
of it out first, and then Nintendo put a subpar version out themselves.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.700
I bet you you'll see Tetris on Christmas.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.700
I bet you anything.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.700
They should do the Tengen Collection.

09:57.700 --> 10:00.700
I somehow doubt that.

10:00.700 --> 10:04.700
Yeah, Color Dreams games showing up on my Wii, I would set fire to my Wii.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.700
Okay, those games were ass.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.700
But Tengen Tetris was so much better.

10:09.700 --> 10:10.700
That game was cool.

10:10.700 --> 10:11.700
I'll give you that.

10:11.700 --> 10:12.700
I wouldn't mind them so much.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.700
Those are just basically Atari games, like Klax.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.700
Those games were cool.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.700
Kicks.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.700
But the Color Dreams games were also like non-licensed games.

10:19.700 --> 10:20.700
I know.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.700
They were ass.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.700
Those games were horrible.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.700
You know actually what game I wouldn't mind?

10:25.700 --> 10:30.700
Oh shoot, it was on Super Nintendo, but I used to play it in the arcade all the time.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.700
It was a caveman game.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.700
Trog.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.700
Really?

10:34.700 --> 10:35.700
Do you remember that one?

10:35.700 --> 10:36.700
No.

10:36.700 --> 10:37.700
That was a weird game.

10:37.700 --> 10:38.700
I do not.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.700
Alright, well moving on with other virtual console news.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.700
One game in the UK.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.700
One game.

10:44.700 --> 10:45.700
Double Dribble.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.700
At least it's one fucking good game.

10:47.700 --> 10:48.700
Yeah.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.700
Double Dribble is pretty good.

10:50.700 --> 10:54.700
You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but I did play a shitload of Double Dribble.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.700
And NBA Jam was like the all-time greatest basketball game is NBA Jam.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.700
Did you ever play any of the arcade NBA Jams that had the Mortal Kombat hacks?

11:02.700 --> 11:03.700
Of course.

11:03.700 --> 11:04.700
Of course.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.700
The Scorpion is an unlocked character, absolutely.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.700
And you could play as the president.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.700
Anyway, how did a Double Dribble story turn into an NBA Jam?

11:12.700 --> 11:13.700
Because you said NBA Jam.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.700
Yeah, I know.

11:14.700 --> 11:15.700
Your fault, Rob.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.700
Haha.

11:16.700 --> 11:17.700
Tangent.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.700
Uh-huh.

11:18.700 --> 11:19.700
Uh-huh.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.700
Anyways.

11:20.700 --> 11:26.700
So, if you're not into Double Dribble, maybe you're into betting.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.700
And of course, coming to Super Smash Bros.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.700
Can I bet on Double Dribble games?

11:32.700 --> 11:34.700
No.

11:34.700 --> 11:39.700
Coming to Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a spectator mode, and they will have online betting.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.700
Ooh!

11:40.700 --> 11:42.700
Nintendo is encouraging gambling.

11:42.700 --> 11:43.700
Oh my God.

11:43.700 --> 11:50.700
Send out all those stupid parent groups or whatever.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.700
Let's ban the game now.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.700
It'll get your children knocked up as well.

11:55.700 --> 11:59.700
Isn't spectator mode kind of stupid, though, because you don't know who you're watching?

11:59.700 --> 12:00.700
Maybe.

12:00.700 --> 12:04.700
Like you're watching Player 1 and Player 2, you don't see their names because there's

12:04.700 --> 12:10.700
no centralized service like Xbox Live to protect the children from going into spectator mode

12:10.700 --> 12:16.700
and seeing some guy's name as Cock Wrangler or something is their screen name on Nintendo.

12:16.700 --> 12:17.700
I don't know.

12:17.700 --> 12:22.700
Something that the filters don't pick up because they spell it C-A-W-K or whatever.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.700
Mommy, I bet on Cock Wrangler.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.700
Always bet on Cock Wrangler.

12:27.700 --> 12:32.700
But at least I think if the person is on your friends list, you should be able to see their

12:32.700 --> 12:33.700
name, right?

12:33.700 --> 12:34.700
Maybe.

12:34.700 --> 12:35.700
I don't know.

12:35.700 --> 12:39.700
Anyways, it will allow you to observe, of course, players' battles, including the betting

12:39.700 --> 12:45.700
system, where you can use your hard-earned coins to wage your own combatants during Brawl

12:45.700 --> 12:48.700
battles, and winning can pay off big.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.700
Of course, you can also earn stickers.

12:51.700 --> 12:52.700
Hooray!

12:52.700 --> 12:53.700
Stickers!

12:53.700 --> 12:56.700
Like real stickers or like in-game stickers?

12:56.700 --> 12:57.700
Not real stickers.

12:57.700 --> 12:58.700
Well, tough.

12:58.700 --> 13:03.700
You don't get real stickers.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.700
And of course, I don't know.

13:07.700 --> 13:12.700
It sounds neat, I guess, but once again, I have a feeling that people are going to be

13:12.700 --> 13:14.700
like, hey, you can bet money on it.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.700
I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.

13:17.700 --> 13:21.700
I wonder if you're going to get people throwing matches and stuff.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.700
Like this big underground scheme?

13:23.700 --> 13:26.700
No, you can't because you don't know who's playing in it.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.700
I don't know.

13:29.700 --> 13:33.700
Odd1 says all games should have a mechanic by which they mail you stickers.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.700
I don't care if they're not related to the game, I also want stickers.

13:36.700 --> 13:41.700
So, are you suggesting we go back to the Activision patch system that they had?

13:41.700 --> 13:42.700
Absolutely.

13:42.700 --> 13:47.700
I mean, if you think about it, Xbox Live achievements are indirectly inspired by the old Activision

13:47.700 --> 13:48.700
patch thing.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.700
You know what I think they should do?

13:50.700 --> 13:51.700
Oh, Activision.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.700
Please tell me someone from Activision is listening.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.700
Here's a fabulous idea.

13:55.700 --> 14:00.700
Put all those old Activision games together yet again in one of those bundles, but have

14:00.700 --> 14:03.700
the achievements be the old patches you used to get.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.700
Like, you know, when you would get so many points in a game, then you could unlock the

14:06.700 --> 14:08.700
little picture of that patch.

14:08.700 --> 14:09.700
That might be kind of cool.

14:09.700 --> 14:13.700
Even though we've seen those Activision packs like a million times for different consoles

14:13.700 --> 14:17.700
or whatever, I think one more would be kind of cool if for nothing else but that.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.700
And maybe put some Xbox Live in it.

14:19.700 --> 14:20.700
There you have it.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
Put an oink in it for God's sake.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.700
Oink was awesome.

14:22.700 --> 14:23.700
Sorry.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.700
Rant.

14:24.700 --> 14:25.700
Oink.

14:25.700 --> 14:34.700
Guess what store is promising Wii's?

14:34.700 --> 14:38.700
It actually was supposed to happen this weekend in time for the holiday season.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.700
The low, low price of $399 for a bundle.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.700
It's a whole bundle for it.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.700
You would never guess what store would have this.

14:45.700 --> 14:49.700
TJ Maxx is selling an ultimate Wii bundle.

14:49.700 --> 14:55.700
Now, for those that don't know this store, TJ Maxx, I used to live right next to one,

14:55.700 --> 15:00.700
and it's basically just like Ross Dress for Less, but like one step above it.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.700
I don't think it's a step above.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.700
Yeah, I think it's really on the same tier as Ross Dress for Less.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.700
So how TJ Maxx got Wii bundles is beyond me.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.700
That's what makes this story funny for those that don't understand.

15:11.700 --> 15:12.700
I don't know.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.700
Is TJ Maxx nationwide?

15:13.700 --> 15:15.700
Yeah, we had him in Mobile.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.700
Oh, okay.

15:16.700 --> 15:17.700
Then they're pretty nationwide.

15:17.700 --> 15:18.700
They have him here.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.700
It was really ghetto.

15:19.700 --> 15:20.700
Or maybe those overseas.

15:20.700 --> 15:24.700
It's like, it's definitely not Macy's.

15:24.700 --> 15:25.700
We'll put it that way.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.700
It's definitely not a designer clothes place.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.700
It's cheap.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.700
It's kind of like buying your clothes at Walmart.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.700
But even Walmart at least is cheap.

15:35.700 --> 15:36.700
I bought cute stuff at Walmart.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.700
Yeah, Walmart at least is cheap.

15:38.700 --> 15:40.700
It's like buying your clothes at Kmart.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.700
Yes, there you go.

15:41.700 --> 15:45.700
Because Kmart, you can find stuff that was still ugly in the 80s.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.700
And I'm not joking.

15:47.700 --> 15:48.700
Yeah.

15:48.700 --> 15:49.700
Yeah.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.700
TJ Maxx is an interesting place.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.700
So, that's why this story is so humorous for those that maybe don't have it.

15:55.700 --> 15:56.700
I don't know.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.700
By the way, that will only be featured in selected stores only.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.700
And yes, you have to buy the whole goddamn thing as a bundle.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.700
It's the Wii System and 15 accessories.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.700
Which I'm sure is a bunch of crap.

16:06.700 --> 16:07.700
Yeah.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.700
That you don't need.

16:08.700 --> 16:12.700
I hope you like golf attachments and tennis racket attachments.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.700
And the potato chip holder that will also hold your Wiimote.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.700
At least that because it sucks.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.700
God damn it.

16:18.700 --> 16:19.700
That thing actually looked kind of cool.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.700
Just buy a damn bowl.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.700
No.

16:21.700 --> 16:22.700
To put your chips in.

16:22.700 --> 16:23.700
You don't need a fucking little thing.

16:23.700 --> 16:30.700
How about we cleanse the pallet with the undead.

16:30.700 --> 16:31.700
Okay.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.700
Zombies are great.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.700
I love the undead.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.700
I mean loathe the undead.

16:35.700 --> 16:36.700
I know.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.700
Let's turn zombies loose in TJ Maxx.

16:39.700 --> 16:43.700
I would totally, totally film that and sell it as a movie.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.700
There you go.

16:44.700 --> 16:49.700
Anyway, for those of us who love the undead.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.700
Who dig their zombies.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.700
House of the Dead 2 and 3 are going to be on Wii.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.700
Using the Wii Zapper.

16:57.700 --> 17:01.700
And you can shoot your zombies in the head.

17:01.700 --> 17:05.700
But you don't have to press A.

17:05.700 --> 17:06.700
Fuck House of the Dead.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.700
I want typing of the dead on Wii.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.700
Now that they support USB keyboards.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.700
Oh that's true, that's true.

17:11.700 --> 17:14.700
They put out that patch a while back and now they support the USB keyboards.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.700
But I love House of the Dead.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.700
And I love Typing of the Dead.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.700
You don't even know.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.700
But I had House of the Dead 2 on Dreamcast.

17:23.700 --> 17:24.700
That was freaking sweet.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.700
I have Typing of the Dead on GameTap.

17:26.700 --> 17:27.700
I have Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.700
I think I might as well.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.700
This new pack is actually kind of neat.

17:32.700 --> 17:38.700
I'm seeing Sega releasing some of these gun games and hopefully they'll release more because

17:38.700 --> 17:40.700
I know with Ghost Squad they started that off.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.700
Of course you can use the Wii Zapper.

17:42.700 --> 17:46.700
The other thing which no one else has really mentioned so far other than the fact that

17:46.700 --> 17:50.700
it's coming out in March is that it's also going to be priced the same as Ghost Squad

17:50.700 --> 17:52.700
which is $29.99 retail.

17:52.700 --> 17:58.700
So you may be thinking, oh hey, 50 bucks for games that don't look that great on the Wii.

17:58.700 --> 18:02.700
It's only 30 bucks and it's actually a pretty good collection and hopefully it's as good

18:02.700 --> 18:05.700
as Ghost Squad because Ghost Squad is pretty fun and I think a lot of people are going

18:05.700 --> 18:06.700
to overlook it.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.700
And it's zombies being shot in the face by your Wiimote.

18:09.700 --> 18:10.700
I mean that is kind of cool.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.700
I love shooting zombies.

18:13.700 --> 18:18.700
And look at it this way, it's not the movie.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.700
Just zombies are great, okay?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.700
Zombies are great.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.700
That's right, zombies are great.

18:24.700 --> 18:29.700
Anyways, so another thing that you're going to probably be pissed off about, especially

18:29.700 --> 18:36.700
if you just bought a DS, is that there's a rumor saying that there's another DS redesign

18:36.700 --> 18:38.700
coming your way.

18:38.700 --> 18:43.700
In fact, it's supposed to happen after the holiday sales kind of die out, probably next

18:43.700 --> 18:49.700
spring, which is kind of interesting because spring is when they release the last revision,

18:49.700 --> 18:51.700
the DS Lite.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.700
The rumor is that it's thinner.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.700
It's not going to have a Game Boy Advance port.

18:55.700 --> 19:01.700
It will have onboard storage and larger screens.

19:01.700 --> 19:05.700
And you know that onboard storage is going to then be used by all the cool games that

19:05.700 --> 19:08.700
come out next so everybody has to upgrade to one of these things.

19:08.700 --> 19:09.700
You know what?

19:09.700 --> 19:15.700
Nintendo, I just bought this fucking thing like three months ago and already you're thinking

19:15.700 --> 19:16.700
about making me upgrade.

19:16.700 --> 19:17.700
You bastards.

19:17.700 --> 19:21.700
I just bought a DS Lite myself too so I don't have to play my wife's pink one.

19:21.700 --> 19:23.700
I bought a nice black one.

19:23.700 --> 19:24.700
Haven't played anything on it though yet.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.700
I still have my white one and I like it.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.700
But remember, I had to get a pink Advance back in the day.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.700
Now people in the chat room are screaming rumor, rumor, rumor.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.700
Yes, it's a rumor but honestly, would it surprise you?

19:36.700 --> 19:37.700
I mean really, think about it.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.700
Look at Nintendo's track record.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.700
I mean, do you see why this is popping up everywhere?

19:42.700 --> 19:45.700
I mean, it definitely sounds true to me.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.700
How many times did they get you to buy the Game Boy?

19:48.700 --> 19:49.700
Seriously?

19:49.700 --> 19:50.700
How many times?

19:50.700 --> 19:51.700
What?

19:51.700 --> 19:52.700
Six?

19:52.700 --> 19:53.700
Seven?

19:53.700 --> 19:54.700
Eight?

19:54.700 --> 19:55.700
It's true.

19:55.700 --> 19:56.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.700
Game Boy.

19:57.700 --> 19:58.700
Game Boy Pocket.

19:58.700 --> 19:59.700
Game Boy Color.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.700
You know, the Game Boy Color Pocket.

20:00.700 --> 20:05.700
Game Boy Color Pocket with cute little Pikachu things that light up when you turn it on.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.700
You know, and so on and so on.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.700
The Game Boy Player.

20:08.700 --> 20:09.700
That was.

20:09.700 --> 20:10.700
Yes, Super Game Boy.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.700
Super Game Boy.

20:11.700 --> 20:15.700
I have one of those.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.700
The Game Boy Advance.

20:16.700 --> 20:17.700
The Game Boy Advance.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.700
Never fails.

20:18.700 --> 20:19.700
SP.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.700
The DS.

20:20.700 --> 20:21.700
The DS Lite.

20:21.700 --> 20:22.700
I have all of those too.

20:22.700 --> 20:24.700
And now one more.

20:24.700 --> 20:25.700
DS.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.700
Whatever they're going to call this thing.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.700
DS Slim and Lite.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.700
They'll call it the DS Uber.

20:31.700 --> 20:35.700
DS Rape, because that's what I keep feeling from making those.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.700
Super DS.

20:36.700 --> 20:37.700
I don't know.

20:37.700 --> 20:38.700
Tiger Claw.

20:38.700 --> 20:42.700
Oh yes, Tiger Claw says the next version of the DS will probably be the DS Micro.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.700
And of course, the Advance Micro.

20:44.700 --> 20:45.700
I have a Game Boy Micro.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.700
You're probably the only person I know that has a Game Boy Micro.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.700
And I didn't pay for it either.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.700
We're still selling those at work.

20:53.700 --> 20:58.700
Or should I say, we still have the same 10 that we've had since the Game Boy Micro came

20:58.700 --> 20:59.700
out.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.700
I would say there's a handheld system by Nintendo that didn't prove to be very popular.

21:02.700 --> 21:03.700
It was the Micro.

21:03.700 --> 21:07.700
Well, I remember when we saw it at E3, I'm like, that's the dumbest idea I've ever seen.

21:07.700 --> 21:12.700
I'm like, what are the best games on Game Boy Advance right now?

21:12.700 --> 21:14.700
All the Final Fantasy games being remade.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.700
I'm sorry, I'm not going to play that stuff on a freaking Game Boy Micro.

21:17.700 --> 21:20.700
Like, Jamie's Puzzle Fighter, I could see that, because the gems are picking up.

21:20.700 --> 21:21.700
But it's got interchangeable fails.

21:21.700 --> 21:24.700
I tried playing Kingdom Hearts on it, and that did not work.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.700
Oh my god, I couldn't read.

21:25.700 --> 21:28.700
You know, even worse is playing a shooter on that damn thing.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.700
It doesn't happen.

21:30.700 --> 21:34.700
You do not play a shooter on the Micro.

21:34.700 --> 21:39.700
Do you remember back in the day on the old school Game Boys, they used to have the magnify

21:39.700 --> 21:43.700
and light things that you could put on top of them, these really hideous things.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.700
But they worked.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.700
They would slightly magnify the screen and light AI, and you'd totally get a headache.

21:47.700 --> 21:50.700
They need that for the Micro, like a magnify thing.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.700
Would that kind of defeat the purpose of buying a Micro in the first place?

21:53.700 --> 21:54.700
You know people would buy it.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.700
Because they're dumb, right?

21:56.700 --> 21:58.700
There you have it.

21:58.700 --> 22:02.700
Well, anyway, you would think the FUs of the Week would come after a heated discussion like that,

22:02.700 --> 22:03.700
but not so!

22:03.700 --> 22:08.700
We have something to trump that, to get your blood boiling just in time for the FUs of the Week.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.700
And it has to do with our friends over at Microsoft.

22:11.700 --> 22:16.700
Now, it's not Microsoft's fault, but Microsoft was hit with a class action lawsuit.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.700
Do you know why?

22:18.700 --> 22:25.700
Because there was a man in Georgia that said that Microsoft improperly allowed his underage kid

22:25.700 --> 22:33.700
to use his debit card to subscribe to Xbox Live and automatically renew the subscription without authorization.

22:33.700 --> 22:39.700
He says that in October 2005, this is being done by Francisco Garcia in Georgia,

22:39.700 --> 22:48.700
and he says that in October 2005, his son, Silvario, used his debit card to buy a $50 one-year subscription to Xbox Live.

22:48.700 --> 22:54.700
A year later, Microsoft automatically billed him for an additional year of Xbox Live without his knowledge or consent.

22:54.700 --> 23:02.700
And he says that the charge sent his checking account into overdraft and that the bank slapped him with a $35 penalty.

23:02.700 --> 23:09.700
This is why you should be careful when using your debit card as a credit card, but never mind.

23:09.700 --> 23:17.700
And then the plaintiff goes on to say that Microsoft refunded the subscription fee, but would not cover the bank penalty.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.700
And he says by accepting a subscription from a minor and automatically renewing it without consent,

23:21.700 --> 23:27.700
Microsoft, quote, fraudulently induced a contractual relationship for Xbox Live services.

23:27.700 --> 23:32.700
It actually would be a son that committed fraud because a son would have had to put it in his father's name for it to go through.

23:32.700 --> 23:39.700
Nowhere is it said how in the hell the kid got the debit card in the first place.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.700
But I guess that's not important.

23:41.700 --> 23:50.700
Garcia goes on to say that Microsoft broke Georgia law when it allowed his kid to use a debit card to sign up for Xbox Live

23:50.700 --> 23:54.700
and then continued to break the law when it renewed the service without written authorization.

23:54.700 --> 24:02.700
He's speaking unspecified damages and asking the court to broaden the case to include all Xbox Live customers in Georgia with similar problems.

24:02.700 --> 24:07.700
So in other words, kids that steal their dad's wallet and use the cards to buy things.

24:07.700 --> 24:11.700
It's not Xbox's fault.

24:11.700 --> 24:17.700
In fact, I've seen how hefty the authorization process is to that because I couldn't use my debit card.

24:17.700 --> 24:21.700
I had to use one of my other credit cards to run it through.

24:21.700 --> 24:25.700
So first of all, they're very specific on putting in the information.

24:25.700 --> 24:29.700
You have to have the complete billing information for the person who owns the card.

24:29.700 --> 24:34.700
Therefore, it is not Microsoft's fault.

24:34.700 --> 24:39.700
It's first of all that guy's fault for letting his kid be able to get into his wallet so easily.

24:39.700 --> 24:43.700
And second of all, it's the kid's issue for basically committing fraud.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.700
Oh, but yet there's more.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.700
Actually, technically that's borderline non-identity theft.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.700
Oh, you want to hear about the kid committing fraud?

24:50.700 --> 24:52.700
Here's more. Here's more, Jamie.

24:52.700 --> 25:05.700
Microsoft has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, saying that they have paperwork that proves that the child misrepresented his age when he subscribed to Xbox Live by falsely stating that he was 18 years old.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.700
Uh-huh.

25:07.700 --> 25:13.700
Well, even though he would have had to have done it under his parents' name for it to have gone through.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.700
It's...

25:15.700 --> 25:17.700
What's the chat room saying?

25:17.700 --> 25:23.700
Dark Tetsuya says, never mind credit card. This is why condoms were invented.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.700
That is brilliant.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.700
Our Chatter of the Week, everybody. Dark Tetsuya.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.700
Everybody, round of applause. Thank you.

25:29.700 --> 25:30.700
Hurray.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.700
Loki, no comments?

25:32.700 --> 25:33.700
That's just an idiot.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.700
I mean, seriously.

25:34.700 --> 25:39.700
He didn't notice the charge, you know, was on his credit card in the first place, and then it rebuilt itself, you know.

25:39.700 --> 25:40.700
Well, seriously.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.700
I mean, how do you do something like that?

25:42.700 --> 25:51.700
This is funny, though, because this must have been on an original Xbox account, because now, if your account runs out, all that happens is it turns into silver again.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.700
Exactly.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.700
It doesn't have an auto-renew option. You have to renew it.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.700
There is no auto-renew.

25:55.700 --> 25:56.700
Yeah, so...

25:56.700 --> 26:00.700
That auto-renew thing was kind of shady, though, the way they used to do it.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.700
But that's why you've got to be careful when you use...

26:02.700 --> 26:04.700
That's probably why they don't do it anymore.

26:04.700 --> 26:05.700
Yeah, that's probably why.

26:05.700 --> 26:06.700
But that's why you've got to be careful.

26:06.700 --> 26:13.700
I think a lot of people use, and I'm guilty of this, too, to some extent, but I use my debit card for everything that you probably should use a credit card for, you know what I mean?

26:13.700 --> 26:28.700
And the guy complaining about how overdrafting his bank account or whatever, that I find to be kind of BS, because if that's the case, then you shouldn't have used it in the first place, or let your kid steal it in the first place and put it on there and then not do anything about it the first time.

26:28.700 --> 26:31.700
I mean, a year went by between.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.700
I don't think this case has a chance to happen.

26:33.700 --> 26:38.700
It's not Microsoft's fault that your bank account was so low that you overdrafted, so you know what?

26:38.700 --> 26:53.700
If you didn't want to overdraft, use a real credit card that would have denied it if it was going to hit your limit, although I kind of agree the bank should have denied the charge, but at the same time, this is how banks make money off of people who overdraft. Let's face it, that's one huge way they make money.

26:53.700 --> 27:09.700
On top of that, there's often times where a bank will write off an overdraft charge if it was erroneous, if it can be proven, so it's just really a case of this man in Georgia being a complete and utter moron. End of story.

27:09.700 --> 27:14.700
You deserve that $35 charge, dumbass.

27:14.700 --> 27:36.700
And that being said, obviously stories like this make us very angry, and you know what that means? It's F.U. time.

27:36.700 --> 27:59.700
I have a two-part F.U. The first F.U. goes towards this man in the black Toyota truck who pulled out of the gas station and into my lane and cut me off. You're a stupid piece of shit, and you totally deserve to have that cop car pull you over.

27:59.700 --> 28:09.700
All right, Loki. Oh, it's two-part, I'm sorry. I thought you said that was mine, and then I was like, okay.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.700
Okay, well, that's okay. I'll be nice.

28:12.700 --> 28:13.700
You sure?

28:13.700 --> 28:14.700
Yes.

28:14.700 --> 28:18.700
All right, and I guess the two-part is F.U. Rob. Well, F.U. Jamie, how's that? Cutting in front of Loki.

28:18.700 --> 28:19.700
Your mom.

28:19.700 --> 28:20.700
F.U. Jamie, your mom.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.700
Last night.

28:21.700 --> 28:42.700
Loki, I don't have much to be angry about, but I am annoyed at the Priuses that were driving in front of me today. Apparently, owning a Prius means you drive slow. So, screw you Prius owners, and I don't give a shit if you're helping the environment. You're not helping the environment because you're making me late. Or late-er.

28:42.700 --> 28:52.700
F.U. to the macaroni and cheese pizza at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza because that shit was nasty. Well, dude, the macaroni and cheese pizza was nasty.

28:52.700 --> 29:00.700
The peanut butter pizza was kind of weird. I like the peanut butter pizza, too. But the best was the barbecue chicken.

29:00.700 --> 29:05.700
The barbecue chicken at Alfredo was okay. It makes the incredibly shitty pizza not that shitty.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.700
I like the macaroni and cheese pizza, though.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.700
Yeah, you're weird. F.U. to Jamie twice.

29:09.700 --> 29:13.700
Yeah, well, F.U. back to your-

29:13.700 --> 29:14.700
F.U. infinity plus one.

29:14.700 --> 29:18.700
Yeah, you can't add plus one to infinity because infinity is already infinity.

29:18.700 --> 29:19.700
Well, I just did.

29:19.700 --> 29:20.700
Well, then you created-

29:20.700 --> 29:27.700
What are you going to do? Tell God to smite me?

29:27.700 --> 29:29.700
Sometimes the chat room just needs to be here.

29:29.700 --> 29:35.700
That silence, by the way, was Jamie actually praying. I know that was great radio, boys and girls, but there you have it.

29:35.700 --> 29:40.700
I want to point out, though, real quick about some of the previous stories.

29:40.700 --> 29:45.700
GS68 had a great comment about the whole father and the kid thing.

29:45.700 --> 29:54.700
The father should cut his credit card and stab his kid with one of his sharp edges.

29:54.700 --> 29:58.700
I don't know. I almost think GS68 might have just taken the crown of Chatter of the Week.

29:58.700 --> 30:03.700
We might have to have a good old fight over this.

30:03.700 --> 30:19.700
Anyways, I don't know if this is good or not, but Atari, the CEO, has resigned and the company has exited game development, which is fine because can you really think of the last good thing to come out of Atari?

30:19.700 --> 30:21.700
I know I can't.

30:21.700 --> 30:22.700
The Atari 5200?

30:22.700 --> 30:28.700
I guess the Test Drive series, but they don't really- I don't know if they're still publishing that. I guess they did.

30:28.700 --> 30:30.700
Yes, Test Drive. There you have it.

30:30.700 --> 30:33.700
Test Drive. Okay, fine. That's the only thing, but whatever.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.700
Flashback consoles.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.700
Oh, okay.

30:37.700 --> 30:44.700
But anyways, what, they had such wonderful series that they sold off to Ubisoft Driver. Oh, that was awesome.

30:44.700 --> 30:49.700
Such a wonderful game. It had no flaws at all. Oh, wait. No, I'm sorry.

30:49.700 --> 30:52.700
Stuntman. That was okay.

30:52.700 --> 31:04.700
But anyways, so yeah, the Test Drive series has been now licensed to Infogrames, which had, if I remember correctly, didn't they have the really cool theme song that they made for their company?

31:04.700 --> 31:09.700
I'm sorry, it wasn't cool at all, but it was a theme song for their company.

31:09.700 --> 31:18.700
You know how I knew Atari was going downhill about 15 years ago? Did you ever play a game in the arcades called Pit Fighter?

31:18.700 --> 31:21.700
I remember Pit Fighter. It was-

31:21.700 --> 31:24.700
I think this game was Atari, yes?

31:24.700 --> 31:28.700
No, I don't think it was Atari. Was it Atari?

31:28.700 --> 31:29.700
It sucked.

31:29.700 --> 31:35.700
But it was a Mortal Kombat digitized type game.

31:35.700 --> 31:42.700
It's also one of the worst goddamn video games I've ever played in my entire freaking life. I mean, it's horrid. It is a horrid game.

31:42.700 --> 31:52.700
Well, remember we mentioned, I think it was last week or the week before last, about Atari's big games that are coming out? What, the Alone in the Dark series?

31:52.700 --> 32:01.700
There's Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 3, and then there's such wonderful titles like Godzilla Unleashed and Jenga.

32:01.700 --> 32:05.700
Yay, Jenga. Who thought that was a good idea?

32:05.700 --> 32:13.700
Odd1 says, Pit Fighter for Super Nintendo, proof that I was stupid as a child.

32:13.700 --> 32:16.700
It's okay, Odd1.

32:16.700 --> 32:19.700
Seriously, Jenga, what the hell were you thinking?

32:19.700 --> 32:25.700
I mean, it's hard enough to play the game as it is, but, oh, let's play the Wii, that'd be even easier.

32:25.700 --> 32:33.700
Because everyone wants to play- the only reason that people aren't playing Jenga is because it isn't set under the sea or in some fantastic fictional world.

32:33.700 --> 32:39.700
That's why people aren't playing Jenga. Not because, you know, it's Jenga or anything.

32:39.700 --> 32:46.700
Seriously, look at this box art. Here's the Sega Genesis version, which was put out by Tengen and, yes, developed by Atari.

32:46.700 --> 32:53.700
Look at this. I forgot about the dominatrix lady fighter they had in it. I mean, this is a horrible fucking game.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.700
Why is that guy just in his underwear?

32:55.700 --> 33:00.700
Because that's what they wore when they fought, was panties.

33:00.700 --> 33:02.700
Dominatrix fighters.

33:02.700 --> 33:03.700
It would be manties.

33:03.700 --> 33:09.700
Yes, manties. Digitized manties. That's what you have to look forward to in Pit Fighter.

33:09.700 --> 33:14.700
Well, good riddance, Atari. Your time is up. Your fifteen minutes are over.

33:14.700 --> 33:19.700
All right. Well, Loki jumped the gun a little bit because we were actually supposed to have the mailbag segment before that.

33:19.700 --> 33:20.700
Eh, whatever.

33:20.700 --> 33:25.700
That's all right. We can be fluid here on the show. We can, you know, change things around on the fly.

33:25.700 --> 33:28.700
So, Dark Soccer, are you ready to do some mailbags?

33:28.700 --> 33:33.700
Sure. All right. When you send us emails at mailbag.orangelandradio.com,

33:33.700 --> 33:37.700
Jamie will read the emails and she'll pick out her favorite emails and read them.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.700
And that's what she's going to do right now here on the program.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.700
Let's open up the mailbag.

33:41.700 --> 34:00.700
First email dun dun dun comes from Robert M., who is a regular writer, I would say, to our station.

34:00.700 --> 34:11.700
And, actually, I have a slight problem with my email because what happened is I had a problem with Firefox doing its...

34:11.700 --> 34:13.700
I'm going to close the new thing again.

34:13.700 --> 34:16.700
And it didn't reload all the windows, so let's go back to this.

34:16.700 --> 34:22.700
Just to clarify last week's letter, while playing the game to a podcast would indeed be bizarre.

34:22.700 --> 34:31.700
He's talking about Faze. What I meant is that if you play Faze before you sync your iPod with iTunes,

34:31.700 --> 34:34.700
it will not credit the songs or podcasts played during that session.

34:34.700 --> 34:39.700
So, let's say I listen to OLR Part A, 30 songs play Faze through my break at work.

34:39.700 --> 34:43.700
I listen to 20 more songs followed by a viewing of the latest Ask A Ninja episode.

34:43.700 --> 34:49.700
Once I sync my iPod to my computer, but the iPod and iTunes will completely forget that 50 songs of podcasts have been played.

34:49.700 --> 34:54.700
I'm not sure why this is. I have the 5th generation 30GB model, if that makes any difference.

34:54.700 --> 35:00.700
Secondly, in the ideal way, Nintendo doesn't add an option to view the most recently added Miis.

35:00.700 --> 35:05.700
Since two of the four options, one of which is the default, show the most popular Miis,

35:05.700 --> 35:12.700
assumes that the most popular Miis can only get more popular, and the newer ones get entirely overlooked.

35:12.700 --> 35:17.700
If you ever see any Miis who look vaguely like members of the US, whose line is it anyway, let me know.

35:17.700 --> 35:21.700
Looking forward to your next show, Robert M.

35:21.700 --> 35:25.700
That would be nice, but it'll never happen, because they're lazy.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.700
That has been sort of proven.

35:28.700 --> 35:31.700
Next one.

35:31.700 --> 35:36.700
And actually, we got an email from someone who's asking technical questions on the station,

35:36.700 --> 35:40.700
which I will actually be replying to off of the air.

35:40.700 --> 35:46.700
But I'm acknowledging that we received one from DJ Mikey Mike, which I think is actually kind of funny.

35:46.700 --> 36:00.700
Then we got a review of a game from Xenocore, who actually sent the email about Oreno Riori, which we had Rob look up.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.700
So I'm going to go through and read this email.

36:02.700 --> 36:07.700
Hey Ola, the Xbox 360 controller is a good addition to my control set for my PC.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.700
I use it for my classic games quite often.

36:09.700 --> 36:13.700
However, I wonder if anyone else is having the same issue that I am.

36:13.700 --> 36:17.700
However, I test the inputs for the controller, but the triggers seem to be on the same axis.

36:17.700 --> 36:22.700
If I use the left trigger, the axis goes to 0%, and if I pull the right one, it goes to 100%.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.700
Pull both of the axis stays at 50%.

36:25.700 --> 36:30.700
Also, the right stick will only show movement in the low left to high right diagonal.

36:30.700 --> 36:33.700
I can't use it as a second analog control. What the fuck?

36:33.700 --> 36:36.700
I thought Microsoft made PC controls better than this.

36:36.700 --> 36:40.700
Hopefully, it's just the crack my roomie snuck into my food.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.700
One more thing.

36:43.700 --> 36:53.700
Since my question had folks guessing, allow me to tell you why I seek the knowledge that I do with the quick review of Oreno Riori for the PS1 Japan.

36:53.700 --> 36:58.700
My cooking, as it is known in the US, is a DualShock-centered cooking simulation.

36:58.700 --> 37:06.700
The player is a head chef of a cooking establishment that has you preparing various dishes, depending on the restaurant's theme, ramen, fast food, etc.

37:06.700 --> 37:13.700
To use the first stage as an example, you take the customer's order as they walk in, start the soup for the ramen, chop the vegetables for the ramen, the thinner the better.

37:13.700 --> 37:16.700
One stick is used for your hand position.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.700
The other controls the chef's knife.

37:19.700 --> 37:23.700
You take the soup off of the heat before it burns, you put the ramen in the brim of the blob, ok.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.700
You cook ramen.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.700
The game comes in here. You have six seats that can be full at one time.

37:28.700 --> 37:32.700
Managing what you work on and when is the name of the game.

37:32.700 --> 37:37.700
In your prep time, your orders will pile up, causing the irate customer to leave before you are done and lower your restaurant's rating.

37:37.700 --> 37:40.700
Hey, isn't there a Flash game like that on Yahoo?

37:40.700 --> 37:42.700
Except you're just serving people.

37:42.700 --> 37:43.700
You mean Diner Dash?

37:43.700 --> 37:45.700
Diner Dash, that's it.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.700
While you are running the restaurant, other random events occur.

37:47.700 --> 37:51.700
These show up as attacks on the other players in versus mode.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.700
A customer may leave without paying.

37:53.700 --> 38:01.700
You have to chase him down, kill the roaches that flood into the restaurant with your shoe, call the police on wandering drunks that enter the restaurant, and washing dishes.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.700
There's a link here on that.

38:03.700 --> 38:04.700
The game is a blast to play.

38:04.700 --> 38:10.700
If you like Cookie Mama and want to feel like a short order cook from Rolf House, give this game a shot.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.700
It makes Cookie Mama look like a welcome part.

38:12.700 --> 38:15.700
Dr. Sarkar, this game is especially worthy of a spot in your import collection.

38:15.700 --> 38:16.700
Maybe.

38:16.700 --> 38:20.700
Hopefully you won't kick Cookie Mama to the curb after playing this one.

38:20.700 --> 38:21.700
As always, keep up the good work on the show.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.700
Yours truly, Xenocore.

38:23.700 --> 38:29.700
Rama is suggesting Iron Chef for the Wii, and Son of Dad in chat room is suggesting Hell's Kitchen for the Wii.

38:29.700 --> 38:33.700
That would be great. My Wii could swear at me and tell me what a horrible person I am when I botched this.

38:33.700 --> 38:35.700
I thought they were doing a Hell's Kitchen Wii game.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.700
Or not a Wii game, but a Hell's Kitchen game.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.700
A Playstation 2 game or something, yeah.

38:39.700 --> 38:41.700
I want to say I heard something about that too.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.700
There you have it.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.700
That sounds like an interesting game, though.

38:45.700 --> 38:48.700
I would check it out, yeah.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.700
Why not?

38:50.700 --> 38:52.700
People do play stuff on PS1.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.700
Howdy, O.O.R.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.700
I've heard this guy mention the fondness for old school Zork and an enthusiasm I share.

38:58.700 --> 39:03.700
I thought you guys might be interested in this, and this is www.ifcomp.org.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.700
I-F-C-O-M-P.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.700
It's one of the few yearly contests.

39:07.700 --> 39:09.700
This one just wrapped up for Homebrew Text Adventures.

39:09.700 --> 39:15.700
There's quite a community out there of interactive fiction enthusiasts.

39:15.700 --> 39:24.700
I've designed a half-assed I.F. game or two, but never finished anything, so I think that these intrepid designers deserve a round of applause.

39:24.700 --> 39:27.700
I encourage anyone interested in the medium to check it out.

39:27.700 --> 39:32.700
It can be used in some fascinating ways and often surpasses gaming and story and character development.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.700
Anywho, keep keeping on. You guys rock.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.700
Atreyu.

39:35.700 --> 39:40.700
You know, I want to say about a year ago, there was somebody that did an Orange Lounge Radio Text Adventure game.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.700
I seem to remember playing it.

39:42.700 --> 39:43.700
It was pretty fun.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.700
It was very funny. It was very cool.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.700
I would like to see a sequel done.

39:47.700 --> 39:54.700
This one comes from Ospher, which actually I think I have two emails from Ospher.

39:54.700 --> 39:56.700
I'm sorry, you're limited to one email a week.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.700
The other one's really short, so I'll just...

39:58.700 --> 39:59.700
Fine.

39:59.700 --> 40:02.700
Actually, it doesn't matter. The other one's a request, so I'll read the one.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.700
Hey, O.R.

40:03.700 --> 40:04.700
Hey.

40:04.700 --> 40:06.700
I was just curious about your names.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.700
Sky, Dark Sakura, and Loki.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.700
Yeah, it's this question again.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.700
We haven't gotten this question in a while. Why not?

40:12.700 --> 40:15.700
What's the story behind them, and when did you start using those names?

40:15.700 --> 40:21.700
As for mine, Ospher is simply a cross between Zephyr, one of my favorite Bimani songs, and Austin, which is my real name.

40:21.700 --> 40:22.700
Oops.

40:22.700 --> 40:25.700
Well, I guess you wanted us to know if you were reading it online.

40:25.700 --> 40:26.700
Random comment.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.700
Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions is my new anti-drug.

40:28.700 --> 40:29.700
Thanks, Ospher.

40:29.700 --> 40:30.700
P.S.

40:30.700 --> 40:35.700
I know that you'll do what you want, but I still insist for a star for the Sega Genesis.

40:35.700 --> 40:39.700
I've tried to describe this game to people, and I get weird looks, but trust me, it's a gem. Play it.

40:39.700 --> 40:40.700
I know, I've played it.

40:40.700 --> 40:41.700
P.P.S.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.700
Yara, sponsored by Kmart.

40:43.700 --> 40:44.700
P.P.P.S.

40:44.700 --> 40:47.700
I want to hear Loki rant in an English accent.

40:47.700 --> 40:51.700
Well, maybe we can get Loki to tell us about his name in an English accent.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.700
No, I'm not doing that.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.700
Well, won't you give us a jolly old story?

40:56.700 --> 40:58.700
I'm not even trying tonight.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.700
Alright, tell us about your name.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.700
It's named after a Norse god.

41:02.700 --> 41:05.700
I started using it when I was playing Qsar.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.700
A lot.

41:07.700 --> 41:10.700
O.M.G., you didn't get it from Dogma?

41:10.700 --> 41:15.700
No, actually, if anything, I got it from The Mask.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.700
Alright, there you have it.

41:17.700 --> 41:21.700
Well, mine was, I used to be a Japanese major when I lived in Alabama.

41:21.700 --> 41:22.700
Go fig.

41:22.700 --> 41:25.700
I was actually going into the JET program, which is why I was doing it.

41:25.700 --> 41:31.700
But our teacher decided that she would give all of us names in Japanese in class

41:31.700 --> 41:37.700
so that when we were doing stuff in class, we would just use those names.

41:37.700 --> 41:39.700
My French teacher did the same thing, too.

41:39.700 --> 41:43.700
I was actually taking French and Japanese at the same time, which I never recommend doing.

41:43.700 --> 41:49.700
But she was trying to think of one for me, and since I was born in the spring in April,

41:49.700 --> 41:53.700
she gave me Sakura for the cherry blossoms blooming in April.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.700
So that's how I got it.

41:55.700 --> 41:58.700
And I just decided at the time when everyone else was making dark names,

41:58.700 --> 42:00.700
I put dark in front of it.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.700
Because you were emo.

42:02.700 --> 42:05.700
This was pre-emo.

42:05.700 --> 42:07.700
Yes, but you're always on the cutting edge, Jamie.

42:07.700 --> 42:08.700
I am.

42:08.700 --> 42:15.700
But the other funny thing about this is that I met somebody on AOL who went by Evil Sakura

42:15.700 --> 42:17.700
who was mad at me for getting dark Sakura,

42:17.700 --> 42:24.700
but it turned out her boyfriend knew Dan because Dan at the time had

42:24.700 --> 42:31.700
RichterDX, as in DraculaX, and her boyfriend had RichterDXX

42:31.700 --> 42:35.700
and had gotten into a stat with Dan over their code names,

42:35.700 --> 42:38.700
and it turns out that this guy is Chris Tang.

42:38.700 --> 42:40.700
Oh, wow.

42:40.700 --> 42:42.700
So that's how we met him.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.700
It's a world of laughter.

42:44.700 --> 42:45.700
Small world, huh?

42:45.700 --> 42:47.700
It's a world of tears.

42:47.700 --> 42:49.700
It's a world of hope.

42:49.700 --> 42:50.700
This is back in the day.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.700
I wish I had a funny story to my name.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.700
Mine is just like this constant evolution.

42:54.700 --> 42:56.700
I don't know.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.700
How do people pick screen names?

42:58.700 --> 43:00.700
They pick something that sounds interesting.

43:00.700 --> 43:02.700
And so my very first screen name was Green Sky,

43:02.700 --> 43:05.700
because if the sky were green, that would be different but cool,

43:05.700 --> 43:07.700
and that is kind of how I perceive myself.

43:07.700 --> 43:10.700
I'm different, but I like to think I'm cool, even if kids tell me otherwise.

43:10.700 --> 43:13.700
But that name is taken on a lot of sites.

43:13.700 --> 43:16.700
There are five other green skies out there, so it's hard to use that name.

43:16.700 --> 43:19.700
So at one point I decided to spell sky differently,

43:19.700 --> 43:21.700
so you put an IE instead of Y.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.700
So it was Green Sky, and then one day I said,

43:23.700 --> 43:26.700
I'm not green anymore, so it was just Sky.

43:26.700 --> 43:29.700
And that's the real deal, like how my name came about.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.700
It's just one constant evolution after another.

43:31.700 --> 43:34.700
So it's not Ski or Grenski or whatever people say.

43:34.700 --> 43:36.700
It's just Sky.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.700
That's it.

43:38.700 --> 43:39.700
And it works.

43:39.700 --> 43:43.700
I'm GZDR4EV.

43:43.700 --> 43:46.700
I actually had the name before there was a Dark Sakura,

43:46.700 --> 43:48.700
before there was a Sakura in Street Fighter.

43:48.700 --> 43:52.700
I was in college in 1994.

43:52.700 --> 43:57.700
No, I started taking Japanese in early 1995, so this predates.

43:57.700 --> 44:01.700
However, I did think it was funny that there was a Dark Sakura later,

44:01.700 --> 44:04.700
and I said that I should sue Capcom for name infringement,

44:04.700 --> 44:06.700
but it was a joke.

44:06.700 --> 44:07.700
You should.

44:07.700 --> 44:10.700
I actually adopted the character as my avatar later on,

44:10.700 --> 44:15.700
so I even sunburned all the pictures I had and gave her red eyes.

44:15.700 --> 44:16.700
All right.

44:16.700 --> 44:18.700
Well, there you have it, the story of our names.

44:18.700 --> 44:19.700
Was that the last email?

44:19.700 --> 44:20.700
Yes, it was.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.700
All right.

44:21.700 --> 44:25.700
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you have further things to contribute.

44:25.700 --> 44:30.700
Meanwhile, we go back into the gaming news with this story out of Brazil.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.700
That's right, gaming news out of Brazil,

44:32.700 --> 44:35.700
and this is actually pretty awesome.

44:35.700 --> 44:37.700
This is a company called Tech Toy,

44:37.700 --> 44:41.700
and what they're doing is that they're basically licensing from Sega

44:41.700 --> 44:47.700
the right to make an official portable Genesis, or if you will, Mega Drive.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.700
It's an official portable Mega Drive,

44:49.700 --> 44:52.700
and it has a little controller and three buttons on it.

44:52.700 --> 44:55.700
I would say it looks like a Game Boy Micro, but bigger,

44:55.700 --> 45:00.700
and it has the buttons on it, and it has 20 games already on it.

45:00.700 --> 45:04.700
Alex Kidd, Sonic and Knuckles, Golden Axe, Echo the Dolphin,

45:04.700 --> 45:08.700
and of course the color of the unit is blue, just like Sega.

45:08.700 --> 45:11.700
The 20 games are already pre-installed on the unit.

45:11.700 --> 45:15.700
Unfortunately, you can't add to them or take away from them

45:15.700 --> 45:16.700
once you have the 20 games.

45:16.700 --> 45:17.700
That's all you get.

45:17.700 --> 45:19.700
So they say.

45:19.700 --> 45:22.700
It runs on three AAA batteries.

45:22.700 --> 45:23.700
Kind of interesting.

45:23.700 --> 45:28.700
It will cost about the Brazilian equivalent of $100 US.

45:28.700 --> 45:30.700
December 5th is the day it comes out,

45:30.700 --> 45:32.700
just in time for Brazilian Christmas,

45:32.700 --> 45:34.700
which there will be no snow.

45:34.700 --> 45:35.700
I'll tell you something about that.

45:35.700 --> 45:36.700
There might be.

45:36.700 --> 45:38.700
Brazil's a big country, and there's lots of mountain ranges,

45:38.700 --> 45:41.700
but I think it's the other time of year over there, so anyway.

45:41.700 --> 45:43.700
Well, something about that is that actually,

45:43.700 --> 45:45.700
Dan was pointing out to me,

45:45.700 --> 45:47.700
and this was a couple years ago that he pointed out to me,

45:47.700 --> 45:52.700
is that the Sega Master System actually still has a very big following in Brazil,

45:52.700 --> 45:55.700
because a lot of the Master System sites that he found,

45:55.700 --> 46:01.700
or even a lot of ROMs that he found when we both used to be heavy into emulation,

46:01.700 --> 46:07.700
were games that were Genesis games that we knew on the Genesis,

46:07.700 --> 46:08.700
but had been put out for Master System

46:08.700 --> 46:11.700
because they had come out over there on Master System.

46:11.700 --> 46:13.700
I think all of our Brazilian listeners,

46:13.700 --> 46:14.700
of which there ought to be a few,

46:14.700 --> 46:16.700
because Brazil's a big fucking place, right?

46:16.700 --> 46:18.700
It's just as big as the US almost, right?

46:18.700 --> 46:20.700
So I think all our, if not bigger,

46:20.700 --> 46:25.700
Brazilian listeners should get together and pool money enough.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.700
Like if everybody chips in,

46:27.700 --> 46:29.700
let's say there's like 10 people listening to Brazil,

46:29.700 --> 46:31.700
I'll chip in $10 and send us one of these,

46:31.700 --> 46:33.700
because it sounds kind of fun-ish.

46:33.700 --> 46:35.700
I'll fully pay for one.

46:35.700 --> 46:37.700
Let me know what the ratio is,

46:37.700 --> 46:39.700
and I'll totally pay for one.

46:39.700 --> 46:40.700
Nice.

46:40.700 --> 46:41.700
I want one.

46:41.700 --> 46:44.700
I want one too, but I don't want to have to pay for it,

46:44.700 --> 46:47.700
because I'm cheap.

46:47.700 --> 46:48.700
All right.

46:48.700 --> 46:49.700
We'll see.

46:49.700 --> 46:52.700
Anyhow, so that's all I got to say on the portable Mega Drive.

46:52.700 --> 46:55.700
It is out in Brazil, or coming out soon.

46:55.700 --> 46:58.700
Well, this makes me a very, very sad panda,

46:58.700 --> 47:01.700
although I'm not a panda.

47:01.700 --> 47:02.700
It makes you a sad Jamie?

47:02.700 --> 47:05.700
It makes me a sad me, but not an MII.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.700
All right, what is it?

47:06.700 --> 47:08.700
Stuff.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.700
Marvel Universe Online,

47:10.700 --> 47:12.700
there's actually a rumor of cancellation going out.

47:12.700 --> 47:16.700
It's been stated that the MMO has run into,

47:16.700 --> 47:20.700
quote, serious, potentially stalling developmental troubles.

47:20.700 --> 47:23.700
Of course, I find it funny that my reference here,

47:23.700 --> 47:25.700
which is on joystick,

47:25.700 --> 47:29.700
said that probably because everyone wants to be Wolverine.

47:29.700 --> 47:30.700
Not me!

47:30.700 --> 47:33.700
So apparently it wasn't Banjo-Kazooie.

47:33.700 --> 47:35.700
Oh, is that the big main game

47:35.700 --> 47:37.700
that looks like it's getting cancelled, Marvel?

47:37.700 --> 47:39.700
Was that supposed to be an Xbox 360 exclusive?

47:39.700 --> 47:41.700
I thought it was on PS3 and Xbox.

47:41.700 --> 47:42.700
No.

47:42.700 --> 47:43.700
Oh, that is a big deal then,

47:43.700 --> 47:45.700
because that was like Xbox's MMO,

47:45.700 --> 47:48.700
which it was only going to be playable on that system.

47:48.700 --> 47:50.700
Yeah, because it wouldn't have totally been just exactly

47:50.700 --> 47:53.700
like City of Heroes or anything like that.

47:53.700 --> 47:54.700
But it would have been Marvel.

47:54.700 --> 47:56.700
It might have been kind of cool.

47:56.700 --> 47:57.700
Eh, nope.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.700
Eh, we'll see.

47:59.700 --> 48:01.700
I want to see a fighting game.

48:01.700 --> 48:03.700
I need to do that Mortal Kombat versus DC.

48:03.700 --> 48:04.700
That'd be pretty cool.

48:04.700 --> 48:09.700
Anyways, so the King Kong game is coming out here pretty soon.

48:09.700 --> 48:12.700
Wait, the King of Kong game?

48:12.700 --> 48:13.700
DVD, sorry.

48:13.700 --> 48:15.700
I think Donkey Kong came out like 20 years ago.

48:15.700 --> 48:18.700
Hey, they're going to make a game based on this movie you watch.

48:18.700 --> 48:20.700
There's a lot of bad ideas out there

48:20.700 --> 48:22.700
and people are waiting to jump on that stuff.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.700
Orange Lounge Radio bringing you the late breaking news.

48:25.700 --> 48:28.700
Oh, hey kids, did you hear about that totally rad Donkey Kong

48:28.700 --> 48:31.700
that's coming out?

48:31.700 --> 48:32.700
No, listen, dude.

48:32.700 --> 48:34.700
Okay, the King of Kong game, okay?

48:34.700 --> 48:36.700
You'll play as the people playing Donkey Kong.

48:36.700 --> 48:39.700
This is like even better than Donkey Kong,

48:39.700 --> 48:42.700
because you're playing people playing Donkey Kong.

48:42.700 --> 48:47.700
Anyways, so yeah, the DVD's coming out soon, in January,

48:47.700 --> 48:49.700
being put out by New Line.

48:49.700 --> 48:51.700
Actually, we're doing some of our work for this thing.

48:51.700 --> 48:55.700
They're having me set up some sort of Donkey Kong competition.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.700
Are you going to have the guys there?

48:57.700 --> 48:58.700
No.

48:58.700 --> 48:59.700
They should come.

48:59.700 --> 49:00.700
No, we're low budget, okay?

49:00.700 --> 49:03.700
They asked me to download the virtual console game,

49:03.700 --> 49:05.700
yet I see no monies for this.

49:05.700 --> 49:07.700
They said they'll pay me back later

49:07.700 --> 49:11.700
and then they're going to put it on our big theater screen.

49:11.700 --> 49:19.700
Anywho, so yeah, it's going to be coming out apparently January 29th.

49:19.700 --> 49:23.700
Yeah, but it'll be out on the internet long before.

49:23.700 --> 49:26.700
Probably as soon as screeners come out for that.

49:26.700 --> 49:28.700
People pirate that shit like crazy.

49:28.700 --> 49:30.700
I'm sure there's already a version that's one of those cameras.

49:30.700 --> 49:32.700
The question is, why would you want to pirate this?

49:32.700 --> 49:33.700
I mean, seriously.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.700
I have heard it's a good movie.

49:35.700 --> 49:38.700
It's a good movie, but seriously, is it worth wasting a DVD for me?

49:38.700 --> 49:40.700
Come on.

49:40.700 --> 49:41.700
I want to see it.

49:41.700 --> 49:43.700
You should not talk negatively about this.

49:43.700 --> 49:45.700
I'm not talking negatively about it.

49:45.700 --> 49:49.700
No, it's like, I don't know, it'd be like pirating Gigli.

49:49.700 --> 49:55.700
The one crazy dude we met at all games I think is in this movie, Mr. Awesome.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.700
Was he there when you and I both went?

49:57.700 --> 49:59.700
I know there was one time I went down there and he was there.

49:59.700 --> 50:02.700
I think it might have been a different time when I was there by myself.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.700
It might have been just you because I don't remember.

50:04.700 --> 50:05.700
I think so.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.700
I was there one time by myself because I was there on the road trip.

50:07.700 --> 50:09.700
I think he was in the movie.

50:09.700 --> 50:13.700
Obviously, I'd remember someone named Mr. Awesome.

50:13.700 --> 50:16.700
Was he at E3? He was probably at E3 that year.

50:16.700 --> 50:18.700
I don't know.

50:18.700 --> 50:21.700
Someone named Mr. Awesome needs to be punched in the face.

50:21.700 --> 50:22.700
I mean, seriously.

50:22.700 --> 50:24.700
I'm Mr. Awesome.

50:24.700 --> 50:28.700
This guy was interesting.

50:28.700 --> 50:29.700
There's really no other word to describe.

50:29.700 --> 50:32.700
He was one of the most interesting fellows I've ever met.

50:32.700 --> 50:34.700
I'm sure he was interesting.

50:34.700 --> 50:35.700
Retarded.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.700
No, I'm not going to talk negatively, Loki.

50:38.700 --> 50:40.700
We're not going to have that on this program.

50:40.700 --> 50:42.700
He was just interesting.

50:42.700 --> 50:49.700
Also interesting is the fact that another movie is being made into a hip new game.

50:49.700 --> 50:51.700
Ghostbusters.

50:51.700 --> 50:54.700
But I'm not talking about that old-ass Commodore 64 game.

50:54.700 --> 50:55.700
Although that game was rad.

50:55.700 --> 50:58.700
That was one of the first Commodore 64 games I ever remember owning.

50:58.700 --> 51:01.700
I believe this was on the 2600 and all the other systems.

51:01.700 --> 51:03.700
But there was a new Ghostbusters game coming out.

51:03.700 --> 51:05.700
It's not a remake of the old one.

51:05.700 --> 51:07.700
It's a brand new Ghostbusters game.

51:07.700 --> 51:11.700
This being previewed by an issue of Game Informer magazine.

51:11.700 --> 51:13.700
Apparently some game footage has already hit the internet.

51:13.700 --> 51:15.700
Although it's kind of a bit of a rumor.

51:15.700 --> 51:17.700
No, it's been confirmed.

51:17.700 --> 51:18.700
Is it being confirmed?

51:18.700 --> 51:22.700
If you go to Ghostbustersgame.com, there's a bunch of stuff there too.

51:22.700 --> 51:23.700
Wow.

51:23.700 --> 51:27.700
Anyway, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films.

51:27.700 --> 51:29.700
Since they never did make Ghostbusters 3.

51:29.700 --> 51:31.700
And now the actors are getting kind of old.

51:31.700 --> 51:34.700
Well, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films.

51:34.700 --> 51:36.700
Zootfly is developing it.

51:36.700 --> 51:39.700
And we don't know exactly what platforms it will be on.

51:39.700 --> 51:42.700
But you can probably guess it will be most of the next gen systems.

51:42.700 --> 51:44.700
I do kind of hope though it's on Wii.

51:44.700 --> 51:47.700
Because I think it will be fun to try and not cross the streams on the Wii.

51:47.700 --> 51:49.700
With the whole zapping things.

51:49.700 --> 51:50.700
But anyway.

51:50.700 --> 51:52.700
I don't know if it might be coming out on the Wii.

51:52.700 --> 51:53.700
Here's the other great thing about it.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.700
Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis.

51:55.700 --> 51:58.700
They are all actually a part of the game.

51:58.700 --> 52:02.700
They're apparently writing the script and doing all the voice overs.

52:02.700 --> 52:04.700
So that is kind of cool to know that it's authentic.

52:04.700 --> 52:06.700
Please don't suck this game.

52:06.700 --> 52:09.700
I don't know if Zootfly is actually developing it though.

52:09.700 --> 52:11.700
I know that they were doing something similar.

52:11.700 --> 52:12.700
I think this is actually Nvidia.

52:12.700 --> 52:13.700
It's the same team that worked on it.

52:13.700 --> 52:14.700
Oh my bad.

52:14.700 --> 52:15.700
Sorry.

52:15.700 --> 52:16.700
It was originally rumored as Zootfly.

52:16.700 --> 52:19.700
It's the same team that put together these Scarface games.

52:19.700 --> 52:21.700
So, you know.

52:21.700 --> 52:23.700
That would be cool.

52:23.700 --> 52:25.700
I hope it's cool.

52:25.700 --> 52:26.700
But guess what Rob?

52:26.700 --> 52:30.700
You can pre-order right now through GameStop and you get free shipping.

52:30.700 --> 52:33.700
Because those fuckers will take pre-orders on everything.

52:33.700 --> 52:34.700
Wow.

52:34.700 --> 52:38.700
I think I just got linked some footage here from YouTubers.

52:38.700 --> 52:39.700
Oh, that was crap.

52:39.700 --> 52:40.700
GameGame.com.

52:40.700 --> 52:41.700
Who?

52:41.700 --> 52:42.700
God damn it.

52:42.700 --> 52:44.700
Who linked me to something from G4?

52:44.700 --> 52:45.700
God damn it.

52:45.700 --> 52:46.700
Who did that?

52:46.700 --> 52:47.700
That was SSG100.

52:47.700 --> 52:48.700
Oh, actually no.

52:48.700 --> 52:49.700
That does have the gameplay footage.

52:49.700 --> 52:50.700
I don't care.

52:50.700 --> 52:51.700
It's from G4.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.700
There's a Dutch site that had it also on there.

52:53.700 --> 52:54.700
That's pretty good.

52:54.700 --> 52:56.700
I'm going to try and find.

52:56.700 --> 52:57.700
Here's the game.

52:57.700 --> 52:58.700
Okay.

52:58.700 --> 52:59.700
This looks like the game itself.

52:59.700 --> 53:00.700
Yeah.

53:00.700 --> 53:01.700
Oh good.

53:01.700 --> 53:02.700
Isn't that like an actual first person?

53:02.700 --> 53:06.700
Yeah, I mean maybe we're going to get Ghostbusters Go to Hell which you've been talking about

53:06.700 --> 53:10.700
for like 15 years and I cannot wait for this game.

53:10.700 --> 53:12.700
I can't listen to this.

53:12.700 --> 53:13.700
But it looks cool.

53:13.700 --> 53:14.700
It looks like Resident Evil but like Ghostbusters.

53:14.700 --> 53:18.700
Well, what I like about it is that it's an over the shoulder view and not a first person.

53:18.700 --> 53:20.700
I think that's pretty cool.

53:20.700 --> 53:21.700
Okay.

53:21.700 --> 53:24.700
I've been sent a corrected link from SSG100 Matt without the G4age.

53:24.700 --> 53:25.700
Thank you.

53:25.700 --> 53:28.700
All is forgiven SSG100 Matt.

53:28.700 --> 53:29.700
No?

53:29.700 --> 53:30.700
This is still.

53:30.700 --> 53:32.700
Shame on you.

53:32.700 --> 53:34.700
I'm picking them again.

53:34.700 --> 53:38.700
Are you sure you didn't have the old address copied still?

53:38.700 --> 53:40.700
Maybe I did.

53:40.700 --> 53:42.700
Hold on.

53:42.700 --> 53:48.700
I just think that's highly inappropriate to do to give me such sub par.

53:48.700 --> 53:50.700
Hold on.

53:50.700 --> 53:51.700
Just let it go.

53:51.700 --> 53:52.700
Wait.

53:52.700 --> 53:53.700
Hold on.

53:53.700 --> 53:54.700
Let me try this one.

53:54.700 --> 53:55.700
They may have their little bumper on there but that's it.

53:55.700 --> 53:56.700
No, it's the same shit.

53:56.700 --> 53:57.700
Forget it.

53:57.700 --> 53:58.700
I don't care.

53:58.700 --> 54:02.700
I've noticed something that if you try to click on the video in window to the next sometimes

54:02.700 --> 54:04.700
it will leave the old thing copied.

54:04.700 --> 54:05.700
Brilliant.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.700
That happened to me with the paddle cap.

54:07.700 --> 54:08.700
Okay.

54:08.700 --> 54:09.700
Here we go.

54:09.700 --> 54:11.700
Somebody grayed out the G4 part in the beginning.

54:11.700 --> 54:12.700
That's great.

54:12.700 --> 54:14.700
I approve of this link.

54:14.700 --> 54:21.700
That does look kind of fun.

54:21.700 --> 54:23.700
I hope that is the Wii.

54:23.700 --> 54:24.700
That's a 360.

54:24.700 --> 54:25.700
Yeah.

54:25.700 --> 54:26.700
The graphics look very 360.

54:26.700 --> 54:27.700
They do.

54:27.700 --> 54:28.700
Wait.

54:28.700 --> 54:31.700
Keep going because there's a part where they show the Stay Puft Marshmallow.

54:31.700 --> 54:32.700
Yes.

54:32.700 --> 54:33.700
Wow.

54:33.700 --> 54:35.700
They shot him in the face.

54:35.700 --> 54:43.700
That game looks like it's going to be kind of fun.

54:43.700 --> 54:44.700
Wow.

54:44.700 --> 54:45.700
Very cool.

54:45.700 --> 54:47.700
I would play it.

54:47.700 --> 54:50.700
But guess what else I would play.

54:50.700 --> 54:52.700
What else would you play?

54:52.700 --> 54:54.700
Um.

54:54.700 --> 54:56.700
Luminous.

54:56.700 --> 54:57.700
Luminous is a good game.

54:57.700 --> 54:58.700
I would play that too.

54:58.700 --> 55:00.700
Luminous is coming to Windows.

55:00.700 --> 55:01.700
Wow.

55:01.700 --> 55:03.700
Is it going to have shine in?

55:03.700 --> 55:05.700
It better.

55:05.700 --> 55:06.700
It better have Heavenly Start.

55:06.700 --> 55:09.700
It better have everything else that's awesome about it.

55:09.700 --> 55:10.700
But yeah.

55:10.700 --> 55:12.700
It's going to be on Windows.

55:12.700 --> 55:13.700
So isn't that cool?

55:13.700 --> 55:14.700
That is kind of cool.

55:14.700 --> 55:17.700
Although then again if you think about it Luminous has been hoarded on like every other

55:17.700 --> 55:21.700
thing out there including my cell phone so this does kind of make sense.

55:21.700 --> 55:23.700
I need Luminous for my iPhone.

55:23.700 --> 55:26.700
Give me Luminous on my iPhone I'll be happy.

55:26.700 --> 55:27.700
Keep on dreaming.

55:27.700 --> 55:30.700
Now you know what would be cool is like a version of Luminous on your iPhone that uses

55:30.700 --> 55:32.700
the songs from your iPhone.

55:32.700 --> 55:33.700
That would be cool.

55:33.700 --> 55:34.700
That would be cool.

55:34.700 --> 55:35.700
There you go.

55:35.700 --> 55:43.700
Something not so cool is apparently R-Type Command which is better known as R-Type Tactics

55:43.700 --> 55:44.700
in Japan.

55:44.700 --> 55:51.700
It is coming out over here according to GameStop's website on March 4th.

55:51.700 --> 55:53.700
Although that's probably a placeholder date.

55:53.700 --> 55:59.700
But for $39.99 it is a tactical version of R-Type.

55:59.700 --> 56:01.700
That means it's not going to be cool.

56:01.700 --> 56:10.700
It's being put out by Atlas and I believe it says the game requires or it says excuse

56:10.700 --> 56:14.700
the lightning fast reflexes need to avoid enemy fire.

56:14.700 --> 56:22.700
Instead offering a turn based hex based strategic game play.

56:22.700 --> 56:26.700
You will not just control one ship with a fleet of ships.

56:26.700 --> 56:27.700
I don't know.

56:27.700 --> 56:29.700
It sounds stupid to me.

56:29.700 --> 56:31.700
If it's tactics it sucks.

56:31.700 --> 56:35.700
It's like what would it be like Ikaruga tactics or something like that.

56:35.700 --> 56:39.700
Hey dodging all those bullets is really hard so let's just make it turn based.

56:39.700 --> 56:40.700
Yeah.

56:40.700 --> 56:41.700
Awesome.

56:41.700 --> 56:46.700
If by awesome you mean not at all then yeah.

56:46.700 --> 56:52.700
Let's just call it R-Type Extremely Awesome.

56:52.700 --> 56:55.700
Alright yeah not a game I'm very interested in checking out.

56:55.700 --> 56:57.700
R-Type is cool and all but it's not that cool.

56:57.700 --> 56:58.700
Let's face it.

56:58.700 --> 57:02.700
Skype line open for business www.orangeloungeradio.com.

57:02.700 --> 57:04.700
Click on interact with us for all the details.

57:04.700 --> 57:10.700
Our Skype name is Orange Lounge Radio and our telephone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

57:10.700 --> 57:12.700
You know how long we've been doing Skype a long time.

57:12.700 --> 57:16.700
I think we are actually like one of the first shows ever that use Skype.

57:16.700 --> 57:18.700
Maybe the first.

57:18.700 --> 57:20.700
I don't know if we can stake that claim but it might be worth a shot.

57:20.700 --> 57:22.700
Let's go to the phones.

57:22.700 --> 57:23.700
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

57:23.700 --> 57:24.700
Who's this?

57:24.700 --> 57:25.700
This is Jason.

57:25.700 --> 57:26.700
Hello.

57:26.700 --> 57:28.700
The awesome the awesome the Jason or something like that.

57:28.700 --> 57:31.700
The X awesome Jason X awesome V. What's up?

57:31.700 --> 57:34.700
I was kind of curious.

57:34.700 --> 57:37.700
Has anybody ever played Marble Mania on the Wii?

57:37.700 --> 57:40.700
Marble Mania on the Wii. Marble?

57:40.700 --> 57:43.700
Kororimpa Marble Mania or Marvel?

57:43.700 --> 57:45.700
Yes Kororimpa.

57:45.700 --> 57:52.700
I have played Kororimpa and my old roommate known as Xtaphor on this program was obsessed with that game for a little while.

57:52.700 --> 57:53.700
For like a week.

57:53.700 --> 57:55.700
And I played it too.

57:55.700 --> 57:58.700
It was a very very cute and very interesting game.

57:58.700 --> 58:03.700
My old roommate from Arizona came up here what two weekends ago I believe.

58:03.700 --> 58:08.700
And this is one of the games that he owned and I had never even heard of it before.

58:08.700 --> 58:14.700
And it's to me you know I don't know how how much exposure it got.

58:14.700 --> 58:18.700
It seems like a very unknown game that was actually very very very fun.

58:18.700 --> 58:23.700
I think what happened is that like it kind of felt like an Xbox Live arcade game in a way.

58:23.700 --> 58:27.700
Like it just had so much in common with like Marble Blast and some of those games.

58:27.700 --> 58:29.700
But the tilt control.

58:29.700 --> 58:32.700
But yeah but it had the tilt control which is kind of fun.

58:32.700 --> 58:33.700
No I played it it was fun.

58:33.700 --> 58:38.700
And I seem to remember that one night Rice Princess and Xtaphor were up like laughing all night long.

58:38.700 --> 58:42.700
Because there was like the penguin that would fart while it rolled around.

58:42.700 --> 58:44.700
And it made this little pfft pfft pfft noise.

58:44.700 --> 58:48.700
And it was like really really funny in a five year old kind of way.

58:48.700 --> 58:50.700
I had the penguin but I never actually played with it.

58:50.700 --> 58:53.700
So I used the more mission targeted ones.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.700
Check it out it's hilarious.

58:55.700 --> 58:56.700
And yes it was a Konami game.

58:56.700 --> 59:00.700
And they also did you know obviously DDR and Dewey's Adventure and all this other stuff.

59:00.700 --> 59:01.700
Really?

59:01.700 --> 59:02.700
You don't see.

59:02.700 --> 59:06.700
Well it came out around the same time as Wing Island as well.

59:06.700 --> 59:10.700
And they were both kind of very under the radar and kind of average.

59:10.700 --> 59:13.700
I thought it was kind of neat though because you could play two players on one controller.

59:13.700 --> 59:17.700
If you had one person use the nunchuck and the other person use the remote.

59:17.700 --> 59:19.700
Huh.

59:19.700 --> 59:20.700
So.

59:20.700 --> 59:21.700
I don't know.

59:21.700 --> 59:26.700
Well then three cheers for Kururimpa from our studly Jason.

59:26.700 --> 59:28.700
What else have you been playing lately?

59:28.700 --> 59:33.700
I have been playing Super Paper Mario which is immensely better than Paper Mario.

59:33.700 --> 59:37.700
I never played Thousand Year Door but Super Paper Mario is actually pretty addicting.

59:37.700 --> 59:40.700
You sound pretty in love with your Wii right now.

59:40.700 --> 59:46.700
If it's not 360 which in last I'd say in this week it hasn't been so much I go

59:46.700 --> 59:48.700
between the two.

59:48.700 --> 59:53.700
I was marching through Resident Evil 4 which I still haven't beaten.

59:53.700 --> 59:55.700
Oh Resident Evil.

59:55.700 --> 59:56.700
Okay.

59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.700
Much like I revealed the I don't play Zelda very often and everybody called me a blastomer.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.700
I know.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:02.700
I'm sorry.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:08.700
I've played Resident Evil 2 a couple times but all of these kind of stopped not too terribly

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:09.700
far into it.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:14.700
Code Veronica was the one game that I got I think about halfway through with but I just

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:16.700
kind of stopped playing it.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.700
Resident Evil 4 with the Wii controls.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.700
Big exception.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.700
That made that game so unbelievably fun.

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:29.700
I haven't played Resident Evil 4 on the Wii yet but honestly I thought it was great on

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.700
the GameCube so like the Wii would just add even more to it.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.700
Wide screen and motion controls sounds hot.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.700
Wide screen, the free aim pointing.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:41.700
That's the best part of it is that you have the full screen to aim with the remote.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.700
It makes it the best.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.700
It's great.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.700
It's so fun to control.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.700
It's so fun to play.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.700
Sounds hot.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.700
All right Jason we've got to let you go to get some more calls but any other thoughts

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.700
from our listeners?

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.700
I own Metroid Prime Corruption and I haven't even opened it and played it yet.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.700
Oh my god that game is great.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.700
You need to do that now.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:04.700
I know but I have so many things I want to play.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.700
Tonight Jason.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:09.700
Tonight you are to open that game tonight and play.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.700
You must.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.700
Don't tell me no.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.700
You know you can't tell me no I'm cute.

01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.700
This is true.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:17.700
All right.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.700
All right Jason and say hi to Ry for us.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:21.700
Will do.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.700
Bye.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700
Bye.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:24.700
Bye.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.700
Bye.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.700
Bye.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.700
Bye.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:28.700
Bye.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:29.700
Bye.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.700
Bye.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.700
Our lovely webmaster Jason, VX Jason awesome XV sex V Jason calling in.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:36.180
1877 game OLR or we can just take this call.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.180
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:38.180
Who's this?

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.180
Yo what's up?

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:40.180
It's Rannie.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.180
Rannie what's up?

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:42.180
Not much.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.180
Hi.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.180
Remember.

01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:45.180
Hey Jamie.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.180
Hi Loki.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:47.180
He's ignoring you.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.180
Wow.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.180
Hello.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.180
He's ignoring you Wow

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.540
Microphone down. Oh, sorry. Okay. What's that problem? Remember a few weeks ago you talked about the movie press start

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:06.160
Yes, wasn't that that one that looked like this like horrible like not even a b-movie but like a c-movie production

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.920
But not that that's necessarily a bad thing like done by like total hardcore nerds

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.580
It was fucking awesome

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:21.260
See it was a great my room my roommate ordered it and we watched it last night. Oh my god. It was great

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:26.320
What was tell now without ruining it too much tell us something that was like really funny about it

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:32.700
It's just the homages and the parodies and the respects to gay to old-school gaming

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:35.540
The plot was like very Final Fantasy ish

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.180
The opening was paper boy and well it went on from there

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:46.980
Did it seem like this was a video game movie that got it like it was actually made by gamers and like for people in?

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.980
the know

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:53.700
Yes, and I believe you can make a drinking game out of this were there any well-known actors in it

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:59.980
No brand new people just a total like C movie. How about nudity? Was there any nudity in the film?

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:06.660
No, but there was I'm a nearly naked chick. Okay. Well, that's that's right. That's close to nudity. That's partial nudity

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:10.660
All right, good good times. So cool

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:15.320
Then we'll have to put that on our Christmas list to check out that movie anything that you've been playing this week

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:21.220
Let's see. I've been playing phantom hourglass on and thanks to Jane. I've been playing our own

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:26.440
He he he he he he no dear watch out. The cancer is spreading

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:33.220
Not bad plus I fired up on Age of Mythology been playing that again

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:40.460
Very cool. Sounds cool, and I've been playing that new sim pack that's been coming out for step mania

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.900
What was it orange lounge revolution? Oh, well revolution. Did you check it out?

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.540
Yeah, what'd you think?

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.460
Rob what how come you're not on American Idol? Oh, shut up

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:58.080
My worst fear about that stinking thing is that those karaoke things are gonna get out there was something I did

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.180
It was a stupid thing like three people were listening like nobody listened back in the day

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.260
But go figure one of those three people was recording and now it's out there forever

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:15.460
Horrible horrible, but I do I mean even though that's end of it I can do without I think it's extremely flattering that people actually

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.260
Took the time to create

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:22.540
Something related to orange lounge radio and and some of our in jokes say it's incredibly flattering

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:27.900
So thank you to everybody who was involved because I knew like probably like six different people contributed step files backgrounds

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.940
I mean, it was a group project. So well done to all

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:35.100
Definitely and after playing and I suggest the DT. We need to do something new

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.460
All right. Well, then you'll have to get a hard at work on

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:46.380
Ol revolution second mix plus I'm no not dancing not dancing. Oh, oh a new game

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:53.220
I suggested orange lounge the revolution the fighting game. Well, wait, what about a new game, right?

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:57.540
There was yes, there was a well our versus age AGI wasn't there at some point

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:03.060
I was like, well before we get to that we gotta have the first game which would have to be orange lounge the fighter

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:09.900
I say AGI to fighter then the versus match. I see I see so we will build to the versus game. That's good

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:15.140
All right. Well, you guys get to work on that any last thought any last thoughts for the callers Rambo before we let you go

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:19.060
I think we'd start this after the holidays, you know when everybody's like oh

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:25.420
Let's make a fighter. That's fine when everybody's that's what that's when I'm gonna finally get around to redoing the website into something viewable

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:30.900
We'll be around holidays. All right. Take care Rama. Love you guys. Later. Mwah. Bye

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:34.160
If you'd like to give us a call one eight seven seven game

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.900
Ol our username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word smooshed together. No spaces. No dashes. Nothing

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.020
All right

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.660
The Rob D says good luck with the AG side

01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:49.740
I'm one of the few fighting fans and I guess AGI has been on a bit of like a kind of like a little bit

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:53.900
Of a hiatus in the past few weeks and I think that's because Scott's been on a little bit of a hiatus

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:59.820
and I think that's because Scott's been going on the road doing like a reality show type thing with these guys who are

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.180
Like a counter-strike team. I think it was I watched I watched the pilot that he had posted

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:10.300
It wasn't bad. Is it because his writers went on strike? No, this was planned before the writers went on strike

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.740
No, I meant his writers went on strike, you know for all his jokes. I don't think his writer

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.660
I don't know. He has writers if they are they're definitely not Union

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.340
But yeah, I watched the pilot. It's not bad

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:22.820
He posted all over if you have all games friended or whatever was it was a good watch

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:28.180
But the only thing that pissed me off is apparently he was in El Dorado Hills, which is two towns over

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.340
Did we get a call? No, I've ever seen that stupid bus thing right there. That was Scott was there

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.980
Oh that bastard that bastard didn't give us a call

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.940
He has a second punch in the face after mr. Awesome. That's right. I

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:50.300
Saw that bus I'm like, oh my god, there's a counter-strike buzz at that fucking next-level place now

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:55.180
we have these now we have a reason to have the olr fighting game because some of these to punch Scott in the face for

01:06:55.180 --> 01:07:01.540
Not calling us when I obviously was in Loki's backyard. I was there. I went to see a movie like god

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:03.020
There's a counter-strike bus here

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:07.060
I'm like, why would they well because it went to this land center next level or something

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.660
I we've haven't we all been there. I haven't no I had I have a customer that hates

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:16.540
Their competing land centers or whatever and they they absolutely hate them and they talk crap about them all day long

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:21.220
But um, you know, so I saw them like why is there anyone here? I mean, seriously, it's El Dorado Hills

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.780
I mean like does anyone actually play land games here means?

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:31.900
All right. Well, we're gonna go back to the phones and we'll take another call and then we're going to

01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:37.620
Get into some last-minute stories be someone awesome. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.600
Hi legend Zaku, what's on your mind said awesome

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:47.080
Um, um, but I've been much just chilling on this weekend coming

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:52.120
Basically just coming back from tournaments and whatnot. What tournament was it this time?

01:07:52.840 --> 01:08:00.260
Those went on Jersey you heard of this arcade called fun and games, which is closing down five months to relocate nearby

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.000
So they were just having a holding shit load of tournaments yesterday

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.360
No, the only arcade I've been to in Jersey is that eight on the break, which is pretty well known I guess so yeah

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:16.580
But besides that I'm just you know, just gloating over the fact that just you know a game like

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.480
Like Mario Galaxy, you know

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:26.960
Now last week you were so freakin excited like you had so much energy last week when you called in the thing

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.760
Is that it's like more it's basically plays like Mario 64 the whole thing plays like it and that's a bad thing

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:40.560
Good job. It plays its motion. You know, it's basically Mario 64 motion controls and if your graphics and

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:45.300
You know, I mean when you place when you play Mario 64, I mean

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:51.360
You get that feeling of just you know that new innovate anyway innovative, you know

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.060
Just you'll die instantly and you have life

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.880
Or is this one? I don't know. I guess it kind of

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.060
Kind of here's what it boils down to. Here's what boils down to a Zaku is that did you have fun?

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.400
Because if you have yeah, I was happy

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.360
Yeah, I know I just got to give a little bit more time since I played I only played in Nintendo

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.160
We're you know launched last week then again. I have I haven't picked up the full game myself yet

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:22.400
I tried to go to Toys R Us this week to pick up the game because they're doing that whole $25 gift card thing and

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.800
Once you know what they didn't get the game the day it came out. There's some shipping delay

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.320
I don't know probably some frickin truck full of Super Mario galaxies tipped over on the freeway or some shit

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.320
So I didn't buy it

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.440
But I did we did that preview last week and I got I was lucky enough to get to play it for the 40 minutes

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.360
It was fun to see I would get a week, you know, I would just I would seriously get a week

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.360
There was you know more

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.200
More in terms of a little bit more hardcore games

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.600
I know they're trying to stick to the you know, I'm trying to stay on you know, the course of all casual thing

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:55.920
I mean, I already know Metroid and you know whatnot but stuff like I don't know

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.200
I'm just gonna make good use of the motion controls

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.960
You know and especially the online stuff that's pretty much lacking

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:07.240
They want to compete with you know against Microsoft and Sony but brawls gonna be sexy

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.420
That's I know right here probably gonna be so I think that's gonna be like the new you know

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:17.580
The new game for anime conventions. Oh Lordy's. Yes, you're gonna see a whole bunch of like those otaku folks

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:22.440
She's duking it out with the motion controls and whatnot. It's gonna be the new tournament game

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:27.820
February. All right, Zaku any other thoughts for our listeners before we take some more calls. Um

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:33.860
Just gotta love the hypocrisy of people banning Mass Effect one day and unbending the other

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.380
Talking to you see this one. All right

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.900
Rock on Zaku

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.940
right

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:42.940
I

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:48.460
Sounded so let down at the end there rock on right

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:55.940
All right. Oh Mass Effect sounds like it'll be fun. No one looking forward to Mass Effect. I can rock on with Mass Effect

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.420
Mass Effect was oh, it's too much talking though, right?

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:05.120
It's seriously 25 minutes to get those like listening to the Skype segment of this program. It's not necessarily like that

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.800
It's just you know, blah blah blah blah blah. We got set the story blah blah blah blah

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.840
it's funny though because like you you pick your backstory and stuff and it's just it's really but there's lesbian sex and

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.000
In the way you get the name your character

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.440
But they all call you by your last name because you can't change that

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.000
All right, we're getting another call sir. We got to get to it. All right. Hi, you're on orange loss radio

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.120
Who's this? This is Brad from pod culture. Hello Brad from pod culture a long time. Go talk. What's on your mind?

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.280
That's the first time I've been able to listen to the live feed in about a month

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.960
Well who said you were excused to leave for one? No, I'm kidding. I know things get in the way

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.120
Well, I heard a Zaku

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:41.780
Talking about Super Mario Galaxy

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:46.280
Yes, pick that up yesterday and let me think it's the most fun

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.760
I've had in the game in a long time and that's what a lot of the reviews are saying

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:57.000
Did you hear this week Mario Galaxy is now like the official like number one rated game ever on that

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.600
I don't know if it's metacritic or one of those other like game rankings. That's what this game rankings calm is surpassed

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:08.760
Ocarina of time is the number one game now granted one negative review will fuck that all up at this point

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.240
But right now it is like the number one game of all time

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:16.360
Which actually kind of surprised me because I thought generally Bioshock was getting better reviews this year, but go fig

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:22.600
People let me not play Bioshock yet. I can't judge on that but it's the first Wii game

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.880
I've seen where the controls haven't felt tacked on

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:26.960
Aha

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:31.440
Because because this this was the game and I think a lot of people have kind of described it this way

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.440
This was the game that the Wii was kind of made for

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.040
Like this was Miyamoto's big idea

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:40.520
Like here's how I want to do the next Mario game and they're like, okay Miyamoto. You're so fucking awesome

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.520
We'll build a console around it

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:49.720
It is it's really cool because it's it just feels natural and playing it and it's still it was a

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.900
Had an old-school feel but it still had the new controls and pretty graphics

01:12:55.900 --> 01:13:01.960
But it was a lot of fun and it had that little bits of retro ness that you've come to love from Nintendo

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:07.660
Like tell me when you were watching that opening scene and the airships came in and the old-school airship music from Mario 3 play

01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.540
Tell me that wasn't awesome. Oh

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:15.180
Even when he goes down the tube and it makes the little sound. Yeah, it's great little touch of retro ness

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.880
That makes it makes it awesome. So for him when you're in one of the hidden levels in it

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:25.360
You follow have to pick up the notes and plays a little Super Mario Brothers scene. Oh, that's right

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.800
I remember that that was cool. We saw that and one of the levels we played good times

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:35.080
Anything anything else you've been playing lately besides Mario Galaxy? Nah, too busy getting stuff ready for

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:42.100
My girlfriend's trip to the hospital. Oh, no. Sorry to hear that. I hope everything's okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.440
We'll have her in our plumbing removed

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.680
Okay, well we'll have her in our thoughts and hope everything is well and and you'll have to bring her a DS or some games

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:58.000
To cheer her up or maybe doctor who he's mean for what's that picked up harvest moon for her Gameboy Advance

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:58.620
There you go

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:04.580
That will keep a person occupied for a long-ass time to like finally like get anything accomplished in that game. It'll be great

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.800
All right, I just got that saying it call in and say yeah that it's Super Mario is probably the

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.200
Most fun and a long time on that of the game you think it's gonna be game of the year. I

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:23.460
Think it's got a broader appeal than some of the other games that have been rating real high like bow shock won't appeal to

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:29.940
Everybody or Halo 3 won't appeal to everybody but Mario Galaxy has more of a wider appeal

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:32.020
I think that's a dang good point

01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:32.540
You're right

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.420
A lot of the games that are kind of leading the race for game of the year right now

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:43.380
May not have that same family friendly quote-unquote appeal that Mario Galaxy has and that is so important during the Christmas time rush

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.980
very good point

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.460
Well Brad, thank you so much for calling in as always

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:52.580
We'd love to hear from you and and hope everything is okay for you this holiday season already. All right

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.200
Yes. All right. Take care, buddy. Later on. Bye. Bye

01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:00.820
Very good point there Super Mario Galaxy may not be the game of the year for the hardcore gamer

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.020
But certainly a broad game

01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:06.580
Of course, we will be doing a grand Christmas show this year just like we did last year

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:10.740
I should say end of the year show more details on that throughout the month of December

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.680
We have more calls higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:18.320
Hey, what's up guys? It's Robbie. It's been a while. Wow. Hi a while. How are you Rob?

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.520
Not too bad. I've mostly been working on Sunday's closing. So, uh, I work at a bookstore

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.840
So, you know retail gets no time off. Gotcha. Yeah, especially

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.200
Live in a while. So it's nice to hear you guys. Yes

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.880
It's nice to have you on the program and congratulations. You guys have got an icon as well on the marketplace this week

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.120
I understand that is true. Now. We actually need to put out a show and your yes

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.680
And your icon is very nice looking too. I was very impressed

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.880
The funny story about that. Actually, we had a we thought about just toning down our original

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.120
iTunes artwork, but we figured that wouldn't be good enough for Xbox Live, right?

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.800
I I went to one of the all games chatters DC Nate

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.680
awesome guy and

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.040
we talked a little bit about camp with an idea for the clock and everything and

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.940
Prepared all that in I think four hours because that was how much time he had left before out of the the deadline

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.760
Yeah, we had to get that stuff in fast

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:13.000
I remember that because like it was black Bobby was a if I was very firm about the deadlines and uh,

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.840
But I understand I mean he was he gave us worrying to give some time, but it was a very it was a very crude process

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:18.160
Yes

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.400
I'm actually gonna show the chat some of the

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:25.360
Rejects for the icon because we actually had a couple icons that were almost there, but they were rejected

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.480
I'm gonna actually pay some of those in chat. Here's the I'm gonna do the one I did the one

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.280
I did has the three faces and I don't know how

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.840
Folks might like that one or whatever, but there's that one. Yeah. Congrats to you guys as well

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:42.200
Uh, you're kind of more popular than ours, which isn't too shocking considering. I think only six users are using mine

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.200
How would you know? How do you know?

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.620
My gamer card dotnet you can there's something called the gamer pic scout. I think interesting. I'll have to take a look at that

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.760
Here's another one. That's the one that afro guy originally did but unfortunately just didn't look like resize

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.840
But you can see where the arrow scheme kind of came in. So there you go. Anyhow, sorry

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:01.180
Oh, what'd you call in to talk to us about before we derailed you? You've got that also. Sorry

01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:06.580
I'm sorry. What did you call in to talk about before we derailed the call?

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.620
Well, my uh, my first question

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:12.420
Well, actually my only question you guys is uh now that most of the games have come out for this holiday season

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.580
with the exception of Mass Effect, which I actually

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.980
That's still that's still uh due to be released in before the holidays before Christmas, right?

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:26.260
That hasn't been delayed there isn't anything new that I know it comes out in a couple days. Yep, almost here. Okay, cool

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:32.300
Um, where would you rank this holiday season compared to other big ones in video game history as far as quality of games go?

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.660
I'd say it's it's pretty far out there

01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:41.400
But I think 1998 with Ocarina of Time Metal Gear Solid was a probably better in 2001 with Halo

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:47.220
Melee and what was the other big on GTA 3 was probably better. I did complain about this year's games that uh,

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:50.180
to me there's a lack of

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:55.860
Games that that that can be truly considered timeless like a Metal Gear Solid where people will be coming back to it years later

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.760
I'm playing it. Maybe galaxy falls into that mold, but

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.020
Bioshock is a first-person shooter. That's first-person shooters get tossed to the wayside like

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.620
Yesterday's dinner, especially with no no multiplayer to keep people coming back

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:13.440
You know, I gotta say here's the thing about this year's batch of games

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:18.220
I think does make it better than than years past and that is the fact that there's no new consoles this year

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:24.040
There's nothing in the realm of new consoles. There's console redesigns kind of but there's no new consoles

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.700
It's really the first year we have we don't even have a new handheld system

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.980
It's it's it's wide open as to what's out there

01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:34.700
And I think therefore the consoles that are out of the marketplace have had a little more time to mature

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:40.020
Unfortunately, I don't feel PlayStation 3 has used the time to its best of ability

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.380
Which kind of makes me think honestly PlayStation 3 should have just come out this year

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:49.320
But who am I I can see why maybe they didn't do it because you know, they want to be out there whatever

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.600
But all that aside like you kind of see that now, okay there it's not so much the launch games

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.000
We're getting into like the second generation of games and you could say even with 360

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.880
Perhaps even starting to get into the third generation of games for the system

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.880
I think next year is gonna be even better

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:09.960
Honestly, and then probably the year after that is when you're gonna start seeing stuff about the Xbox 720 or their next project

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.360
So you'll kind of start to die down

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:16.080
but I do think kind of like next year will be even better than this year for that reason that there's the

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:20.880
The consoles will have had a little time to age and I think that's the thing about I think you cited 98

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:24.400
I think that was the time when like, you know, 64 had already been out

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.360
PlayStation already been out a couple years. I think those, you know systems kind of had their time to

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:32.480
Really get you know, some of their best stuff

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.440
Like a fine wine Jason says in chat. There you go

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.480
Yeah, that's I was thinking uh, I mean the P

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:46.240
it'll be interesting to see how the ps3 brings it next year because Metal Gear Solid 4 hopefully will be out by next holidays and

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.960
You know 360 really brought it to the table this year. Mm-hmm PlayStation 3 brought a few things with a

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.920
heavenly sword and a

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.640
Well a couple of the other ports that came over from the 360 and hopefully next year

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.360
They can just like really keep it moving

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:05.140
Like hopefully the developers don't jump ship because you know home looks really exciting

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:08.480
I think Final Fantasy 13 is gonna have people drooling, you know

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:13.840
I think there's a lot to look forward to from PlayStation 3, but again, it's been a very slow start

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.440
But who knows that's a real question

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.660
Can I can developers get used to the ps3 and use it to its full potential which?

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.640
Most people seem to agree that it does have a lot of potential

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:26.400
It's just really hard to develop for with how like the 8 trillion cores it has on there. Hmm

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:35.200
Interesting. I'm getting a message from DMN that says 21 Xbox Live users have the olr pick according to whatever he found so

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:41.220
That's amazing. I I would be thrilled if two people were using it. Honestly myself and Loki

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:47.080
So yeah, Bobby is winning by a long shot. He had like 220 as of yesterday

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.420
I think what Bobby has 220 people using his pick

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.040
Yeah, something like that. Let me check

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.720
And I'll post a link in chat to all the their community. Yeah, thanks

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.280
Wow, Bobby actually get to a page that shows all the ranks of

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:05.720
The ranks of all the community like all the pictures in that pack Wow

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.820
That's pretty good. See here. Bobby has 381 evil avatar is

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.140
487 now Seattle evil avatar has a huge community behind them. So I believe that

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.880
Yeah, you guys have 22

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:23.060
Rock Bobby has what like 15 times the number of people using his picture than we do

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.840
AGI is 47. I actually know they have 43. I have eight. Whoo. Whoo

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.180
Nice, don't be in the matrix. Well, we need it. We'll get the shows

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:37.800
Damn it. We need people. Okay people using Bobby pictures. He doesn't need it

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.320
He's switched over to the olr pick or a t-dig pick

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.880
Bobby didn't Bobby don't need the numbers no more

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:49.500
I'm just kidding. I think it's great a lot of support kudos to him. I think it's great to see him at all in this

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.400
Absolutely. All right. Well Rob D. Oh

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:57.160
We've given you way more time the other callers. I gotta let you go. But any quick final thoughts for our listeners

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.200
Um game on we'll try to get t-dig back

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.560
But unfortunately can't make promises since like I'm doing I'm going to work practically full-time in school halftime

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:11.720
But oh, that's you guys know the excuses you guys have been through that before. I'm sure absolutely later. Absolutely. All right. Take care Rob

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:16.960
Good luck to you t-dig was a good show and he hadn't a whole nother guy that edited it too. So

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.460
Lots of work that went into that show. All right, maybe one more call

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:25.100
We got time for one more call then we'll jump into the afterbirth in our rock band post show

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:30.940
Actually, I don't see the line ringing. But let's do some quick last-minute stories. Jamie. You have anything for last minute stories

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.940
I'm not a Mountain Dew

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:40.140
Almost doo doo doo doo doo doo. I see a little more Mountain Dew. I have a left. Well, all right Loki I was gonna say

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:44.860
Avatar the last airbender the burning earth you can get all

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:48.820
1,000 achievement points in two minutes in that game by just

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:52.940
Backing up into a corner and hitting a button over and over and over again amazing

01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:55.020
We got another call higher on orange house radio. Who's this?

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:59.340
This is DMN. Hello DMN. What's on your mind? I

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:08.100
Have a challenge for the three of you. Oh shit. No, no, this isn't anything stupid. I promise

01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.300
Yeah, I don't know about that. I challenge the three of you

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:18.260
To convince myself and everyone listening that dance dance revolution is not dead go

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:22.260
Is what dance dance revolution is not dead. I

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.580
Saw people playing it the other day to the pizza place

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:33.420
Here it is dance dance revolution is not dead amongst children

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:38.140
You've got to look outside the people that grew up with it because we're all ten years older than we were when the game first

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:44.680
Came out but like it's popular still with children children are keeping that series alive. Honestly, you know ten-year-olds love it

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:47.960
That's how DDR is not dead. DDR is not what it used to be. Oh,

01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.060
That's that's for sure

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:56.560
No, I'll agree with you because I picked up supernova 2 and it's arguably the worst

01:23:57.100 --> 01:24:04.440
Musically dance dance revolution game I've ever played in my life interesting because I'm not a lot of people necessarily felt the same way

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.300
You know, like I don't think necessarily was received that poorly by the community

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:12.500
But I don't think I don't think people make such a big deal out of these releases anymore

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:16.660
like I think universe 2 is coming out soon and it's kind of being met with this big and

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.260
This is this is it. It's

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:24.140
It's not that DDR is a bad game because I know there's a lot of people to work on it and they work very hard

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:29.340
On it, but the problem is that DDR has not innovated much in the past years and I've said this

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:32.460
I don't know how many freaking times but even when supernova came out

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:33.260
It was this you know

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:39.460
It's supposed to be this big triumph at DDR is back and it's alive again and they didn't change a goddamn thing with the basic

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:43.620
structure of the game and I think DDR really needs a big kick in the booty and

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:49.300
the reason why I always praised the ultra mix series on this show previously is that like

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:54.360
Three-quarters of the innovative shit you saw on the console games or all coming from the Xbox series

01:24:54.660 --> 01:25:01.180
Things like quest mode things like song lists reaching out into independent music scene, you know all that stuff

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:05.080
that was all innovated by the Xbox team and that's why that

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:12.640
that those types of like innovations at least even when they fail because not everything is done very well like the quest mode in universe

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.640
was god-awful, but

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.800
You know, I think I give them props for at least trying to innovate a dead game

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:25.320
Well, and then the other thing too is that they keep making so many damn games for it

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:30.480
I mean seriously if anybody is to blame for killing the series, it's Konami

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:36.920
It's because well, let's see this year alone. We had DDR universe come out DDR supernova 2

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:42.360
DDR hottest party and we're gonna have DDR universe 2 coming out and then next year already

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.360
I can think of at least two more games that are coming out in the DDR series one

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.240
Which is the never talked about DDR Disney mix or just DDR Disney Channel

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.240
You know, it's crap like that. It's watering this shit down and it's not really innovative

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:04.240
It's just let's throw some more songs in there and that's it. But you know, they still sell very well

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.360
We always sell out of them and you know, if you look in the past, you know

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.040
Recent well, I don't know about the recent charts

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:16.200
but I know that DDR extreme 2 was on the top of charts for a long time or at least supernova was and

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.840
Supernova 2's not doing bad at all

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:25.520
I mean probably their expectations are lower, but you know, I think it's a lot of it is like hottest party

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.960
Mm-hmm. Yeah use the remote nunchuck. That was crap

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:37.120
You know universe I do is gonna be you know, not much more innovative. Okay. Oh great. They brought freestyle mode back

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:42.480
It's a game where you don't have arrows fucking awesome. Here's the thing. Okay, Konami

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:47.120
I one of my favorite game companies ever. I've known people that have worked there

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.120
I have great relationships with a lot of folks who work there

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:55.680
Here's the here's the thing my honest like friendly advice to the folks at Konami take a page from harmonics

01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:02.760
Because look at what harmonics did is that basically they were given the challenge of oh look guitar hero got taken away from you

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:08.760
But we want to make you we're gonna have you make kind of the same thing and they like took what essentially was kind of

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.760
the same fucking game and just

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:16.880
Really ran away with it and with this rock band and kind of made something completely new out of it and this whole like you

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:23.800
Can print your band's t-shirt like this is all like crazy stuff like running away with innovative ideas. I think honestly DDR

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.320
might want to hire a consultant from

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.640
harmonics I

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.740
Don't know what do you think you're doing that I will say you talking about universe

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:36.320
I think musical universe is actually one of the best PDR mixes I've ever played

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:44.320
It had a great variety of music some things that were poppy that I could actually stand because anybody who knows me

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:49.680
And I don't know many people know me that personally. I do not like pop music at all

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:59.880
Having having going from slam to 8-bit to don't play nice, which is a song. I actually enjoyed was a lot of fun

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.320
I agree I agree universe has an excellent song list and that's really what

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:12.440
The standard list from supernova 2 without unlocking anything was just a disappointment there was one song

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.800
I was like huh, this is awesome. Okay. Wait two because I didn't know one song and there was my gold track

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.720
That was a good song, but rock a fellow skank is the only time I'm like, huh? This is a good song

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.720
I mean everything else didn't really stand out

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.840
And it was a bit of a disappointment

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:32.280
You know honestly and again I paid nothing for it. So I should complain too much. I

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.280
Standby that I firmly believe that the best home mix to come out in the US or Japan

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:44.880
Anywhere anytime and probably will always be the best TDR game that comes on the home consoles is ultra mix 2 on the Xbox

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.040
And the reason why I agree that is where they took the most risk

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:55.160
They completely changed the people that did the steps to people that really knew the game of DDR inside and out

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.100
It's where they took some big risks with the song list that paid off in a huge way

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:04.440
It's where they added these new modes that changed the game and had that Xbox live

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:07.580
Dancing that was kind of explored in the first ultra mix game

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.920
But it totally improved on with the you know

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:16.360
Different types of versus mode in the second game. I don't think there will ever be a game DDR game as good as ultra mix 2

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.240
period

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:21.880
That made me feel that made me feel as excited about DDR as I did when I first played ultra mix 2

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:23.880
anyway

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.720
We got to let you go our times about up, but thanks for the call DMN. Okay. Thanks given guys

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.720
Were we able to meet your challenge somehow?

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:38.320
No, it was a good. It was a good discussion, and I actually wanted to call it and not be a bumbling idiot for once

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.660
So we appreciate that so we like it

01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:46.500
We're not a bumbling idiot if they want to hear you being a bumbling idiot. They should just download ol revolution. Oh

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:53.940
Hearts no, but it would be saying your name over and over in a song. There's nothing wrong with that

01:29:53.940 --> 01:30:00.420
But you and drunk drunk revolution seriously WTF OMG WTF bbq. Lol. All right. Bye DMN. All right

01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:07.740
All right, that's it for the skype line today. We got to close it up

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.460
So we're gonna get on our way out of here. Okay, last minute, sir

01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:16.180
Yes, I want to say one more thing because before you before we went to with that call you were talking about

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:23.780
as avatar has huge amounts of achievement points very easily and all you have to do is get in the corner you start a

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:29.180
New game and you basically back up into a corner and keep hitting one button over and over again and you unlock all

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:35.880
1,000 achievement points within two minutes and there's some there's a YouTube of it and it's so fucking easy

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.940
It's ridiculous. And so I'm sure you're all over this game

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:44.300
No, you cheap, but I don't even want to play this game. However, if I happen to run upon this game

01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:49.500
I'm sure I'll play it for the two minutes that it requires to unlock all achievement points and then throw it aside like I would

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.700
Normally, all right. Good luck with that Jamie. We'll take your story real quick. They'll get into Loki's remaining stories

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:57.900
Um, actually this is for anyone who is waiting for unreal tournament 3 on xbox 360

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:02.940
they actually said that it was that it works already and has worked since last spring and

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:09.060
That they've actually put on hold any further development on it because of getting it to work on xbox live

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.780
What about that whole like it's supposed to be on a PlayStation 3 first for like it is going to be out on Windows and

01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:14.860
PlayStation 3 first

01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:21.100
Then they're taking Christmas off and are gonna start working on the xbox 360 version so that they can get it to work with mods

01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:22.460
and everything

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:27.460
Interesting. So that's where the delay is, but it works and it has been working and it could be done by now

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:32.180
But no, but there's that deal, but there's the deal and there's also, you know

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.180
The fact that they're trying to get it to work on live

01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:36.460
All right, Loki anyways

01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:42.460
Microsoft is doing an offer which it's less cool now because originally we thought it was for everybody

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:49.360
but apparently if you own an original xbox and you have a paid xbox live account and if you purchase an

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:56.900
Xbox 360 between November 21st and December 21st of this year, you'll be entitled to a free copy of halo 3

01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:03.380
So you fill out some sort of form and you get a copy mailed to you. Hooray

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:10.620
Postal 3 apparently we bowls in the game and you can kill him in the game

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:12.620
awesome

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.060
And then the Wii Zapper

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:23.280
Apparently with there is of course some pictures that floated on the internet with some unboxing of that and there is a second

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:28.160
Configuration which also begs the question. Why the fuck do you actually need this then?

01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:34.300
Where do you take the nunchuck basically out of the Wii Zapper and you just hold the Zapper with remote in there?

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:41.580
Like you would hold the remote normally so it's a piece of plastic. That's completely useless

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.360
hooray

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.180
But we will soon see can I use the Wii Zapper on a we bowl

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:55.960
Maybe if they put out postal 3 on the Wii have you played manhunt 2 on the Wii yet? No, I really don't

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.960
He's just the PSP, huh? Yeah, I

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:04.480
Am you know, I was all excited to get it originally when it was adult only and now I'm just like eh, whatever

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:10.560
It's just not as controversial anymore. I'll play no more heroes. I'll be pretty cool. But you know, yeah manhunt 2

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.040
I don't care. All right. Well, that's it for last-minute stories. That's it

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:16.400
Then we're gonna go around to get everybody's final thought we can wrap this up

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:22.720
We've been running an hour 40 just for part B. So we're over so we got a wrap it up Dark Sakura your final thought I

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.480
Want pie? Oh

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:29.280
Ooh, my final thought is I'm gonna steal Dark Sakura's iPhone

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.960
No, no is mine, but I also want pie Loki

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:39.360
My final thought is I need to take some more extra strength Tylenol. Yay. Sorry to hear about your headache

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.760
Well, that's it for this week Dark Sakura. Have a good two weeks off. Have fun in Alabama

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.760
I will maybe I will call you on

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:51.320
Sunday sounds good. We I think we originally we're gonna take a week off, but I haven't heard that chatter

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.440
So I don't think we're I don't think we are gonna do that

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.680
I think we are gonna be live the next two weeks. So we'll be here doing our thing

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.840
It could be possible to be here the week after but I might just be dead

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:02.760
Yeah, no, no, you know if you need the night off go for it

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:06.940
and we'll we'll find some of our local favorites to help fill in and

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:12.280
possibly the wheat zapper challenge happens, but if any of our I'm actually gonna be

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.560
hopefully meeting up with a friend of mine back there who

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:23.520
I met again through DDR who I met while I lived out here and then it's nothing is kind of funny

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:29.880
So puppies already volunteering to fill in for a night when you're not here. Okay puppy and send me some chocolate

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.880
Will you allow puppy to sit in the fluffy blue chair when you're happy can sit in the fluffy blue chair

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:39.440
All right, it used to be the big green chair the big green monster chair, but now it's the fluffy blue chair

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:41.760
It's lightweight and fluffy anyway

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.760
That's it folks. We got to play the outro and get on out of here
