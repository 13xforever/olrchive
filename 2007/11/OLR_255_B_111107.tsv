0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19000	Now, the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19000	25000	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 11th of 2007.
25000	28000	Remember, we are released in two parts every week.
28000	33000	So if you missed part A, you can go check it out on our podcast feed in the archives.
33000	36000	Or, of course, there's always our live webcam feed on Operator 11.
36000	39000	Visit www.operator11.com.
39000	41000	And sometimes we do some other little bonus shows, too.
41000	44000	In fact, we're going to be showing off a new game tonight after the show.
44000	46000	So check our Operator 11 archives for that.
46000	49000	Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news.
49000	51000	And Loki is going to start us off.
51000	58000	Anyways, some fun stuff, of course. We got to check this out a little bit during the break here.
58000	62000	But the Check Me Out channel has finally been released on the Wii.
62000	67000	So you can go download it now from the Wii shop there.
67000	71000	And, of course, it's actually pretty cool.
71000	73000	They have a bunch of different things you can do in there.
73000	77000	You can browse the top voted... I guess it's like Hot or Not for Miis.
77000	80000	You can browse the top voted Miis in there.
80000	85000	You can check out some random ones, download the ones you like, which is pretty cool.
85000	86000	Post the ones you think are cool.
86000	88000	Other people will rate them.
88000	90000	Then they have themed contests.
90000	95000	The one going on right now is Design a Mi that looks like Mario without his hat.
95000	97000	Which I've seen a Mi like that.
97000	99000	I think it's on my list. I should just submit that.
99000	101000	I should totally plagiarize. No, I won't do that.
101000	106000	Well, I think if they have the person's name on it, though, it's going to credit them.
106000	108000	So it's not going to say you did it.
108000	110000	But that's basically what it is.
110000	112000	And it's pretty cool looking.
112000	114000	Yeah, kind of interesting. We tape live on Sundays.
114000	117000	And literally, during the break between part A and B,
117000	120000	because we take about a 10-15 minute break between the two parts when we're taping live,
120000	124000	is when the message came on the Wii that the channel was up.
124000	128000	So, Loki and I briefly looked for like five minutes of the new channel during the break.
128000	130000	And some pretty interesting Miis in there.
130000	133000	I like there was like a Jordy LaForge Mi that was in there.
133000	137000	Somebody had created a little miniature picture of like a penguin on somebody's face.
137000	139000	Like I thought that was really good skills.
139000	142000	They have some pretty cool Miis on there.
142000	145000	I don't know if I could post some of the ones I've made, though.
145000	146000	Yeah, you might get rejected.
146000	149000	What happens if you send penis head in? That might get rejected.
149000	151000	That would not be good.
151000	153000	Very cool. So for those of you guys listening live,
153000	156000	for those of you in our chat room and listening live to us on Sunday,
156000	158000	go check that out if you have a Wii. It's up now.
158000	160000	And you can look at some Miis.
160000	163000	And I was just looking at random Miis, and some of them are interesting.
163000	166000	But I thought what was interesting is that one of the Miis that came in the random pool,
166000	168000	because you could put just pool random 50 Miis,
168000	171000	was exactly like a Mi one of my friends had created on my machine.
171000	174000	It was the exact same thing, but it was somebody else's name.
174000	176000	I'm wearing a different color. It was so weird.
176000	177000	So weird.
177000	180000	I guess certain faces are still popular. I don't know.
180000	185000	But anyway, the Check Me Out channel is available right now.
185000	189000	And by the time most of you guys hear this, it will have been out for actually quite some time.
189000	193000	Something moving on, speaking about the Wii.
193000	197000	The Wii has been rumored earlier this week based on a comment from Reggie Fils-Aime
197000	201000	to have 200 virtual console games by the year's end.
201000	203000	And people were kind of freaking out, like, wait a minute.
203000	206000	In order for the Wii to have that many games by the year's end,
206000	208000	they're going to have to really step up their production
208000	210000	by putting out like four and a half games a week.
210000	213000	Four to five games every week.
213000	216000	Sorry, this week you're going to get the first half of...
216000	219000	Some of those old games they put out should only count as half a game, honestly.
219000	224000	But Nintendo put out an official statement that Reggie was only approximating,
224000	229000	that there's not actually going to be 200 virtual console games by the year's end.
229000	232000	But there will be about 180 if they keep up their current output.
232000	234000	So there you have it.
234000	237000	Lots and lots of stuff to check out, the old school stuff.
237000	241000	However, I would like to point out we are, what, 160 games in so far,
241000	244000	and still no guardian legend.
244000	245000	This makes me a sad panda.
245000	246000	That is sad.
246000	247000	It is a crime.
247000	248000	Awful.
248000	250000	So I don't know what rights you have to get,
250000	252000	but you better get those really quick.
252000	257000	So that's all I have to say about the virtual console.
257000	259000	Well, for our friends in the UK,
259000	262000	Super Mario Brothers 3 is heading to virtual console.
262000	264000	Actually, we are getting it on Monday.
264000	265000	Is that correct?
265000	266000	We got it this Monday.
266000	267000	Yeah, we already...
267000	268000	Yes.
268000	269000	This Monday.
269000	273000	And it's going to be 500 Wii points.
273000	276000	Also coming out is Blue's Journey for the Neo Geo,
276000	279000	and that will be 900.
279000	286000	And also Power Golf for Turbo Graphics 16 for 600 points.
286000	288000	Well, I'm glad to see that Super Mario Brothers 3
288000	291000	is making the rounds worldwide, because it is a great game.
291000	293000	It is one of the all-time great NES classics,
293000	294000	so everybody gets to enjoy it now.
294000	295000	Hooray.
295000	297000	Yay.
297000	298000	Anyways.
298000	301000	So apparently some best buys have been breaking the street
301000	304000	on Super Mario Galaxy and settling it early.
304000	305000	Shame on them.
305000	309000	And apparently a few people have been buying
309000	313000	according to the Games Facts forum thread, I guess.
313000	316000	They have pictures online, including stuff.
316000	320000	But hey, you only have to wait a couple more days to play it,
320000	322000	so hooray.
322000	324000	Now, if they had Super Smash Brothers,
324000	327000	that would be a feat.
327000	331000	I somehow don't think they can get that right now.
331000	333000	AZHP is in our chat room and is bragging,
333000	335000	I got a copy.
335000	340000	So apparently somehow some folks were able to get one
340000	345000	from Best Buy, so good job to those folks.
345000	346000	Moving on.
346000	348000	Speaking of Super Mario Galaxy, right now,
348000	352000	right this very minute, there is an event going on
352000	356000	at the Nintendo World Store in New York City.
356000	359000	It is the Mario Galaxy Launch Party.
359000	361000	It's going on right now.
361000	366000	I think it started at 8 p.m. is when it started.
366000	369000	But it's only been going until 10 p.m.,
369000	372000	so I guess it is going to end pretty soon here,
372000	374000	and then it's going to reopen again at midnight.
374000	377000	I guess the game officially goes on sale at midnight tonight.
377000	380000	So the whole thing is going on right now.
380000	385000	And apparently they've had a DJ, dancers, a Velcro wall,
385000	387000	a bungee run, trivia contest,
387000	390000	and a laser light show inside the building.
390000	392000	And apparently Mario himself, or at least a fat guy
392000	394000	in a Mario outfit, is there as well.
394000	400000	250 Wii systems also on sale at the Nintendo World Store.
400000	403000	And actually one of our listeners is there live
403000	405000	and is supposed to be calling us any minute now
405000	407000	with a call, a report from there,
407000	409000	so we might have to interrupt.
409000	410000	Oh, here we go.
410000	412000	I think this is the call coming in right now.
412000	413000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
413000	416000	Who's this?
416000	418000	Hi, this is Zaku.
418000	422000	Hey, Zaku, how are you doing?
422000	425000	I'm just here in the rock right here
425000	428000	just seeing Mario Galaxy on screen
428000	430000	and people just going after T-shirts
430000	432000	and just freaking my ass off.
432000	434000	So, yeah, that's pretty much it.
434000	435000	What the hell's going on?
435000	437000	I mean, there's almost black right now.
437000	439000	What the hell have they been doing there tonight, Zaku?
439000	443000	They've had a Velcro wall?
443000	444000	Large party.
444000	447000	They have a live T-shirt right now.
447000	449000	They're giving out free shit.
449000	452000	There's people waiting in line for the launch,
452000	454000	and I know one of them is the one that actually got
454000	457000	the first Wii in this country last year
457000	460000	in front of us in Times Square.
460000	461000	That same guy.
461000	462000	Wow.
462000	464000	That same guy with the power glove on his right hand.
464000	465000	There's some hard...
465000	468000	He's up on the line like one of the first two.
468000	471000	There's some hardcore people out there right now.
471000	473000	Yeah, I can't hear that much right now.
473000	474000	What?
474000	477000	I was just going to say, it sounds like there's some hardcore people there.
477000	480000	There's like a few dozen people.
480000	483000	But there's like, let me see,
483000	486000	I count maybe 50 or 70,
486000	489000	or like 60 people just waiting in line right now.
489000	491000	So tell us more about...
491000	493000	I've seen beyond the store and into the other buildings.
493000	495000	Tell us more about the special events that are going on.
495000	500000	Have you actually been able to get your hands on the game yet?
500000	501000	Yes, I played it.
501000	504000	They had like three guys with monitors
504000	507000	basically sticking out from like a rod
507000	510000	or something that they're carrying on their back with the game.
510000	513000	Kind of like how they did it last year with the segway.
513000	515000	You know, the Wii hooked up to the segway,
515000	518000	now they're basically walking.
518000	520000	They're carrying all that gear, walking the game,
520000	522000	you know, bringing the game to you by foot.
522000	523000	Wow.
523000	526000	Our chat room is just pretty excited to be hearing
526000	530000	the actual live report from the show going on right now.
530000	532000	In fact, Frisbee in our chat room says,
532000	536000	this is the first time I've heard Zaku call in and not sound sleepy.
536000	539000	So you definitely are excited to be there, right?
539000	541000	No.
541000	542000	Oh, come on.
542000	543000	I had to bust my ass in the cold.
543000	545000	What do you think?
545000	548000	I pretty much kept going to get some coffee
548000	552000	and taking a leak just to get this call through.
552000	553000	But yeah, so far it's been good.
553000	556000	I mean, the game pretty much plays like Mario 64,
556000	559000	only with motion control and slightly better depth.
559000	560000	Awesome.
560000	565000	Well, can you give a shout out to the entire crowd
565000	570000	that Orange Launch Radio says hello?
570000	571000	I'm outside of the crowd.
571000	573000	It's pretty thick right there.
573000	576000	It's going to be hard to get inside there.
576000	578000	Can you give a big shout out to everybody around you
578000	583000	that Orange Launch Radio says hello?
583000	589000	Oh, man, random strangers just saying some crazy stuff.
589000	594000	If I knew about this earlier, then I would have just done my whole body
594000	597000	with all our motion stuff.
597000	598000	It's all good.
598000	600000	It would have put the website down.
600000	608000	It's all good.
608000	612000	Zaku, thanks so much for the report and have fun at the event.
612000	615000	And don't go too crazy, okay?
615000	617000	Yeah.
617000	618000	All right.
618000	619000	Take care, buddy.
619000	620000	Have a good one.
620000	621000	I'll see you guys later.
621000	622000	Later.
622000	623000	Poor guy.
623000	626000	That's one of our infamous callers, the legend of Zaku,
626000	628000	calling us live from the Mario launch event
628000	631000	at the Nintendo World Headquarters in New York City.
631000	634000	Isn't that fun when we can do live reports like that?
634000	637000	More stuff needs to happen on Sunday nights when we can do that.
637000	639000	Good times.
639000	641000	You can definitely hear, like, in the background,
641000	642000	like there's tons of people there.
642000	643000	It's amazing.
643000	644000	All right.
644000	646000	Well, let's move on then with the news.
646000	650000	Thank you, Zaku, again for that special report.
650000	653000	Well, in other news, and I think that this is pretty cool
653000	657000	because there are a lot of fans of this game.
657000	663000	For anyone with a PSP, Disgaea is heading out to PSP.
663000	666000	It will be called Afternoon of Darkness.
666000	668000	Oh, so it's like a new game in the series.
668000	669000	Sounds like.
669000	670000	Cool.
670000	674000	They're putting in a few specific things for the PSP,
674000	679000	like a multiplayer mode where you can go against your friends worldwide
679000	683000	or share items from your shop.
683000	686000	It has an exclusive storyline,
686000	693000	and you're trying to become the beauty queen ultimate overlord.
693000	696000	Isn't that your goal in real life, Dark Sakura,
696000	698000	to become the beauty queen overlord?
698000	701000	No, my goal is just to be the overlord.
701000	703000	I see.
703000	706000	I know a lot of people really love Disgaea for its quirky sense of humor,
706000	707000	and I played it once.
707000	708000	It's fun.
708000	710000	I need to sit down and spend more time with it
710000	712000	if I could ever tear myself away from those damn MMOs.
712000	714000	Well, if you're in the U.S.,
714000	717000	you're in luck because it came out a couple weeks ago.
717000	718000	Sweet.
718000	721000	Definitely worth picking up if you like Disgaea.
721000	724000	So it's very typical that the Brits are getting in a couple weeks behind.
724000	726000	Sorry, guys.
726000	727000	We still love you.
727000	728000	PSP is a region free,
728000	731000	so if you really, really, really, really, really need your Disgaea right away,
731000	733000	then there you go.
733000	736000	Anyways, not the big surprise,
736000	742000	but Sony has released a custom theme maker for the PlayStation 3,
742000	745000	much like they did with the PSP after they had theme support for that.
745000	750000	Of course, with the new firmware 2.0 allowing themes,
750000	752000	you can now create your own.
752000	756000	So yes, as soon as I get around to it,
756000	759000	I will create new themes for the PSP website,
759000	762000	and I'll also create a theme for the PlayStation 3 as well.
762000	763000	It's about time.
763000	764000	Sheesh.
764000	765000	Yeah, whatever.
765000	766000	I'm too busy playing stuff.
766000	768000	I just renewed the domain not that long ago,
768000	770000	and I seriously considered just letting it expire,
770000	772000	but then I remember that there were some people that were e-mailing us
772000	774000	saying, I listen to you on the PSP,
774000	777000	and so I figured, all right, for them we'll keep the site up.
777000	779000	It was a really well done website.
779000	781000	You don't see many PSP custom done websites.
781000	784000	I did not renew the domain for OLRE
784000	785000	since I never made a site for that.
785000	786000	Damn you.
786000	787000	Whatever.
787000	788000	Who cares?
788000	789000	Let me forgive you.
789000	793000	Well, also on the PlayStation 3, apparently,
793000	799000	if you had your firmware before version 2.0,
799000	801000	you usually only used to be able to see videos
801000	804000	if it was supported in PlayStation 3's format.
804000	807000	Well, now after the 2.0 patch, apparently,
807000	809000	the PlayStation 3 will now show you thumbnails,
809000	812000	running times, and file names for other supported,
812000	816000	other non-supported formats, such as XVID and DivX.
816000	817000	Now, you can't play them.
817000	818000	You can just see them,
818000	821000	but certainly people are taking that one step further and saying,
821000	824000	well, this is a sign that you're actually going to have support for DivX
824000	826000	and XVID in the near future on the PlayStation 3,
826000	828000	which would certainly be a welcome addition.
828000	829000	Yeah.
829000	831000	But for right now, you only get thumbnails,
831000	832000	and you get to know they're there.
832000	835000	It's just that it will say, you can't watch me,
835000	836000	nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
836000	838000	So there you have it.
838000	839000	Oh, poor baby.
839000	844000	Well, so it's about, you know,
844000	848000	we've had this going on for years and years and years and years, you know.
848000	854000	They have a preliminary settlement for the class action suit
854000	858000	against Take-Two Interactive for the hot coffee.
858000	859000	Oh, boy.
859000	860000	Oh, my God, this is years old.
860000	861000	Yeah.
861000	864000	So basically the terms of the settlement,
864000	866000	the ones who can benefit from that,
866000	869000	as if they bought a copy of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
869000	872000	before July 20th, 2005.
872000	878000	B, were offended by the game's content
878000	881000	that used the hot coffee modification.
881000	883000	That means they would have had, I take...
883000	886000	I was offended that I had to unlock it.
886000	891000	I think, no, they said they were upset by the ability
891000	894000	to modify and alter the game.
894000	899000	Well, I was upset that you had to have an ability to do it
899000	900000	and it wasn't just there.
900000	902000	So can I have money?
902000	906000	And that they would not have bought the game
906000	908000	had they known the ability was there
908000	910000	and would have returned the game
910000	913000	upon learning that the game could be modified
913000	915000	if they thought possible.
915000	920000	So they have to be able to prove all of this
920000	924000	and exchange their copy for a cash settlement
924000	927000	of up to $35 with their proof of purchase.
927000	928000	Wow.
928000	931000	So the...
931000	933000	There's still more money than GameStop will give you for it,
933000	934000	so hey.
934000	937000	Pretty much.
937000	942000	Take-Two is committed to spend 1.025 million
942000	945000	on the settlement benefits
945000	951000	and their out-of-pocket cost total is 2.75 million.
951000	953000	So now you can...
953000	955000	And paying the court cost.
955000	957000	Now, Pete Caruno in our chatroom says,
957000	959000	You can get free money if I say I'm offended by something?
959000	960000	I'm in.
960000	961000	You have to have your proof of purchase.
961000	962000	You have to have the proof of purchase.
962000	963000	Who the hell has a proof of purchase that late?
963000	964000	I know.
964000	966000	Well, that's how they get around it, you know.
966000	968000	But I'm going to save it for granted without a fork
968000	970000	because I'm going to be highly offended by that someday.
970000	972000	I want to see how many people actually have it.
972000	974000	Highly offended that I didn't get my $35 sooner.
974000	976000	There's a statement, by the way.
976000	977000	Oh, yes?
977000	981000	From Ben Fetter, who's the CEO of Take-Two.
981000	983000	If the case had continued,
983000	985000	we believe the court would have agreed that Take-Two
985000	988000	was not liable for consumers acting independently
988000	991000	to modify their games with third-party hardware and software
991000	994000	to access normally inaccessible content.
994000	997000	Nonetheless, we believe it is in the best interest of the company
997000	1000000	to avoid protracted and costly litigation to prove our case
1000000	1003000	and to finally put this matter behind us.
1003000	1006000	Gerardimo says, I'm offended by your offense.
1006000	1008000	ActDeft, our listener from Mexico who's listening,
1008000	1011000	says, I'm suing the guys that made the Spanish training game.
1011000	1013000	I'm offended and I need money.
1013000	1015000	Spanish for everyone.
1015000	1017000	Awesome.
1017000	1019000	Wow.
1019000	1021000	So, I don't know.
1021000	1023000	I would like to see if they're going to release figures
1023000	1027000	on exactly how many people actually went and got money over this.
1027000	1030000	I'd be kind of curious to see how many people actually had the proof of purchases
1030000	1032000	and actually went through the song and dance to do this.
1032000	1034000	I think that would be kind of an interesting figure.
1034000	1037000	I bet it's less than a couple thousand, if that, honestly.
1037000	1040000	I mean, how many people are going to think to do this?
1040000	1043000	Most parents were pissed off and they moved on, right?
1043000	1047000	Well, you know, there's going to be letters that go out to anyone involved
1047000	1049000	that put their name in with the lawsuit.
1049000	1051000	I guess that's true.
1051000	1058000	Anyways, so there's an interesting drama going on on the website The Consumerist.
1058000	1065000	Apparently, a PS3 owner had a problem with their PS3 not working,
1065000	1071000	so they sent it in to be repaired and I guess, according to them,
1071000	1077000	it was too dusty to be fixed and they considered that because of the dust,
1077000	1081000	it was not covered under the warranty.
1081000	1084000	Uh-oh, my Wii is going to be out of warranty as well then
1084000	1087000	with a thick layer of dust on that thing because Mario Galaxy is not out yet.
1087000	1091000	They said that it was an act of God or customer abuse.
1091000	1093000	That would be under...
1093000	1096000	But it's funny though because there was a follow-up to this as well.
1096000	1101000	God has smited my PlayStation 3 with a thick layer of dust.
1101000	1103000	The horror, the horror.
1103000	1105000	But there was also a follow-up to that.
1105000	1110000	I remember reading that that whole statement, of course, is not really true.
1110000	1117000	Yes, Sony does. Dust does not void your warranty as well,
1117000	1120000	but that was in the later follow-up, I guess.
1120000	1122000	But this one lady that was adamant,
1122000	1124000	she said that she was the head of the customer service department
1124000	1127000	or something like that in any way that they called.
1127000	1130000	Oh, and then the other thing too is the guy said,
1130000	1132000	well then hell, take a picture of this dust
1132000	1137000	and let me see what exactly you're talking about if it's so detrimental.
1137000	1139000	And they said, oh no, we can't take any pictures of that
1139000	1141000	because all the pictures would be owned by Sony
1141000	1144000	and then you can't see them without a subpoena or something like that.
1144000	1149000	You have to pay under $50 to repair it out of warranty or something like that.
1149000	1152000	Our chat room is lighting up with conversation here.
1152000	1155000	Odd1 says, it was an act of shitty games.
1155000	1161000	Frisbee says, God made dirt and dirt don't hurt.
1161000	1165000	No, but basically, I was just going to read some sections of this here.
1165000	1171000	The guy, I kept my 60-gig PS3 in an entertainment center since its purchase.
1171000	1176000	It is known within the PS3 community that the thing is a huge dust magnet.
1176000	1178000	I took good care of it.
1178000	1180000	I have ten Blu-ray discs that did not come free of my PS3.
1180000	1182000	Five games, five controllers.
1182000	1184000	Why the fuck do you have five controllers?
1184000	1186000	What the hell are you playing?
1186000	1187000	Maybe specialty controller?
1187000	1190000	NBA Live, I'm guessing, because that game supports up to seven.
1190000	1194000	Or not NBA Live, NBA 08 or whatever, or 07.
1194000	1195000	Yeah, we get it.
1195000	1202000	Two 42-inch LCD TVs, one 50-inch Bravia LCD rear production TV air,
1202000	1205000	something like that, via desktop, via laptop, blah, blah, blah.
1205000	1209000	Anyways, one day I turn it on, I put a disc in, and it doesn't show up,
1209000	1210000	and it won't eject.
1210000	1212000	Finally, I get to eject, and I try to Blu-ray, and nothing.
1212000	1213000	The CD is nothing.
1213000	1218000	So I call customer support who originally told me they can't do anything
1218000	1220000	because I don't have the original sales receipt.
1220000	1221000	It was a gift.
1221000	1227000	I stayed on the phone for hours explaining to them that I have the receipt
1227000	1230000	or I don't have the receipt because it was a gift.
1230000	1235000	Finally, the reps said that it was strange that the early reps hadn't let me
1235000	1237000	go through with the exchange.
1237000	1241000	If it was a gift, it was a policy not to require receipt, blah, blah, blah.
1241000	1243000	Anyways, five days later, I have no updates.
1243000	1249000	Six hours later, after calling them again, I get a call from someone from Nell
1249000	1253000	saying, unfortunately, they have opened the case and taken pictures inside
1253000	1257000	and outside the case, and it was too dirty to be eligible for replacement.
1257000	1262000	SSJ100Matt in our chat room says, was the owner Pigpen from Peanuts?
1262000	1267000	And Azurameh says, I hope I pronounced that right, says PlayStation 3 weakness
1267000	1271000	is dust, which makes me think of the end of signs.
1271000	1274000	It was water that was their weak point the whole time.
1274000	1275000	Now it's like dust.
1275000	1279000	Anyway, he goes back and forth.
1279000	1289000	The supervisor, who apparently was a bitch, named Daria Wu, extension 55682,
1289000	1293000	basically told him that the picture of the PSP was the property of Sony
1293000	1296000	Computer Entertainment of America and that they would have to subpoena
1296000	1300000	pictures in order to see them, and blah, blah, blah.
1300000	1304000	And then, of course, at the very end, he says, I don't get it, so I'm using
1304000	1306000	it to be folding at home with their consoles.
1306000	1310000	The auto start feature makes it so that it's running almost all the time.
1310000	1312000	Of course, it's going to be filled with dust.
1312000	1316000	Few reps said the reason they couldn't replace it is because it looked like
1316000	1320000	it had been two years worth of dust rather than eight months.
1320000	1326000	The console hasn't even been out for years, so obviously that's less than
1326000	1329000	a year's worth of dust.
1329000	1333000	And, of course, he's all pissed off about it and wasn't going to stay quiet,
1333000	1335000	and that's why everybody ran it.
1335000	1340000	And then, apparently, like I said, the follow-up, another consumer rep
1340000	1344000	reported, I'm calling pretty much to clarify the PS3's warranty.
1344000	1349000	If there's any clause in the warranty that makes it so that the PS3 is too
1349000	1351000	dusty, that the warranty is void.
1351000	1355000	And the rep said, no, no, and no.
1355000	1360000	The only way that it voided is if it were neglected, views dropped,
1360000	1362000	or anything like that, modification.
1362000	1367000	Like, if you opened it up, if you don't have the sales receipt,
1367000	1372000	power failures, mother nature actually voids the warranty.
1372000	1376000	Christ, there's a Bible written on this whole thing, isn't there?
1376000	1378000	Let me put it this way, why didn't they just fix it?
1378000	1383000	I mean, seriously, their, I don't know, the fucking system obviously
1383000	1384000	hadn't been opened up.
1384000	1385000	So what?
1385000	1386000	It's dusty.
1386000	1391000	You're doing a horrible job of making it a dust magnet.
1391000	1392000	All right.
1392000	1396000	Well, anyhow, I'm sure we're getting lots of colorful comments on that one.
1396000	1400000	If you have something to attribute, if your PlayStation 3 has died due to dust,
1400000	1401000	we'd love to hear from you.
1401000	1402000	You know what?
1402000	1403000	What?
1403000	1405000	I think this is a job for dust cap, too.
1405000	1408000	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you'd like to send us an email.
1408000	1410000	And Jamie will be opening up the mailbag very soon,
1410000	1412000	but we have one more story for you guys before we get to that point.
1412000	1415000	And that would be about Warner Brothers.
1415000	1419000	Warner Brothers has decided to purchase Traveler's Tales
1419000	1421000	and the parent group TT Games.
1421000	1426000	You might know Traveler's Tales from the Lego franchise as well.
1426000	1429000	So Warner Brothers just wants to own that shit.
1429000	1431000	So there you have it.
1431000	1433000	By the way, they'll be putting out Lego Batman very soon,
1433000	1438000	which looks kind of awesome because I love old school Batman.
1438000	1440000	So there you have it.
1440000	1441000	All right.
1441000	1443000	Well, like I said, every week you guys send us email to mailbag
1443000	1444000	at orangelaundry.com.
1444000	1447000	And the one and only Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag,
1447000	1450000	dive on in and read her favorite emails
1450000	1452000	and maybe some of the ones she didn't like either.
1452000	1453000	Hopefully this is a good week.
1453000	1454000	I don't know, Dark Sakura.
1454000	1456000	Was it a good email week?
1456000	1459000	On a scale of 1 to 10, maybe a 6, a 7?
1459000	1460000	R.
1460000	1461000	It was an R.
1461000	1462000	Okay.
1462000	1463000	Well, anyway, I don't know how that works,
1463000	1466000	but here goes Dark Sakura with this week's mail.
1466000	1469000	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
1469000	1471000	The first email comes from Xenocore.
1471000	1472000	Hey, folks.
1472000	1476000	I recently acquired a copy of Oreno Rioni for a PS1.
1476000	1477000	I love this game.
1477000	1479000	However, the emulators I have used with the game
1479000	1482000	don't give me precise control on all analog sticks.
1482000	1485000	Do you know of the better method to play this game,
1485000	1487000	whether emulated or mod chip?
1487000	1492000	I still have the initial launch PS2 and a 60-gigabyte PS3.
1492000	1493000	What can I do?
1493000	1497000	I love this game and can't wait to play it.
1497000	1499000	Well, I'm not really the best person to tell you
1499000	1502000	because I actually have a Japanese PS2
1502000	1504000	and I have several modified...
1504000	1506000	Well, not really that they're modified,
1506000	1510000	but I have the PS1 before they removed the back port
1510000	1513000	so that you couldn't use the GameShark thing on it.
1513000	1516000	So I really, from experience, could not tell you.
1516000	1518000	What game?
1518000	1522000	It's Oreno Rioni.
1522000	1525000	I had never even heard of that game, I'm sorry to say.
1525000	1526000	So I know we love obscure titles, but...
1526000	1527000	Dear Wikipedia.
1527000	1528000	Yeah.
1528000	1531000	No, not that one.
1531000	1533000	You know, and I got to say, the PlayStation 1,
1533000	1535000	that was kind of the period of my life
1535000	1537000	where I wasn't gaming a whole lot.
1537000	1538000	I played a lot of the big games,
1538000	1540000	like Final Fantasy VII and Infinity of the Night,
1540000	1542000	but I missed a lot of shit during that period
1542000	1543000	because that's when I was in college
1543000	1545000	and I was actually doing a little bit of work
1545000	1547000	here and there between Puzzle Fighter II.
1547000	1549000	I was back in the day when I was purchasing
1549000	1553000	HK copies of games,
1553000	1556000	importing Ridge Racer 4 and shit like that.
1556000	1558000	Well, even Google can't find this.
1558000	1560000	I'll leave it to the chat room to say something about it, though.
1560000	1562000	The Flawless Bolt X says,
1562000	1564000	Funny how someone mentions a PlayStation 1 game
1564000	1567000	when last episode Loki said no one plays them anymore.
1567000	1571000	Hey, there's some irony.
1571000	1572000	In the U.S.
1572000	1574000	Sorry we don't have much more for you, my friend.
1574000	1576000	Hey, we're going to be playing Vibriven.
1576000	1577000	True.
1577000	1578000	Right?
1578000	1580000	Hey, but people that play PlayStation...
1580000	1581000	Let me play it this way, though.
1581000	1583000	If you want to play a PlayStation 1 game right now,
1583000	1585000	you're probably either playing it on a PSP,
1585000	1587000	whether it be modded or not,
1587000	1589000	or, you know, you're probably playing it
1589000	1592000	on a PlayStation 1 that you already have.
1592000	1593000	You know, I don't think people are out there.
1593000	1594000	Maybe there's people out there
1594000	1595000	that want to play Final Fantasy VII
1595000	1597000	or something like that to try it out,
1597000	1599000	but I don't think there's actually people out there
1599000	1601000	that are like, you know what?
1601000	1604000	I think I'm going to buy a brand new PlayStation 1
1604000	1605000	and some PlayStation 1 games.
1605000	1609000	You know, most people don't really go back that far.
1609000	1611000	Sorry, we weren't much help on that one.
1611000	1613000	We're not experts on everything.
1613000	1615000	Just most things.
1615000	1617000	But congratulations for stumping the host.
1617000	1618000	Dude, I couldn't...
1618000	1619000	Here's some free Rice-A-Roni.
1619000	1622000	I couldn't find anything about that game.
1622000	1625000	Anyway, we get an e-mail from Thomas that says
1625000	1627000	O-L-R equals win.
1627000	1629000	Well, thank you, Thomas.
1629000	1632000	And we get one from Robert N.
1632000	1634000	It says, I'm not sure if tonight's show
1634000	1637000	includes plans on discussing the harmonics iPod game phase.
1637000	1639000	Hey, you're psycho.
1639000	1640000	I mean, psychic.
1640000	1641000	Maybe psycho, too.
1641000	1643000	Freudian slip.
1643000	1645000	How dare you insult the listeners.
1645000	1647000	You know what, whatever.
1647000	1650000	But I did go ahead and purchase that on iTunes Store.
1650000	1652000	I have only two complaints,
1652000	1655000	which are issues with all iPods games so far.
1655000	1657000	First of all, it uses a lot of battery power while playing.
1657000	1661000	Secondly, any session between syncing the iPod with your computer with iTunes
1661000	1663000	in which phase is played even once
1663000	1666000	appears to clear out your play counts for all podcasts and songs,
1666000	1669000	which isn't even an issue if you don't care about play counts,
1669000	1671000	but it could be problematic for podcasts.
1671000	1673000	It's playing phase to a podcast.
1673000	1675000	Wow, that might be interesting.
1675000	1676000	Or not.
1676000	1678000	Otherwise, the game is a lot of fun, simple, but addictive.
1678000	1682000	Most of it uses the back, select, and forward buttons
1682000	1683000	tapped to the beat of the music,
1683000	1686000	following on-screen scrolling options
1686000	1689000	with a great artistic style surrounding it.
1689000	1693000	A few parts use the scroll wheel to follow a line for bonus points,
1693000	1695000	which build up stars needed to pass checkpoints.
1695000	1700000	It usually works equally as well with songs you add to the playlist in iTunes
1700000	1702000	as it does with its built-in songs,
1702000	1705000	including new songs by Freezepop, Ben Camaro, among others.
1705000	1706000	Sweet.
1706000	1709000	Highly recommended for fans of music games.
1709000	1710000	Sounds kind of fun.
1710000	1713000	I need to check that out still on my iPod, which I will at some point.
1713000	1715000	I didn't realize it came with some free songs.
1715000	1716000	That I did not know.
1716000	1717000	Freezepop is cool.
1717000	1718000	Very cool.
1718000	1719000	J-Rod.
1719000	1721000	I'm just glad that we missed that concert last week.
1721000	1724000	I bought my PS3 from Kmart,
1724000	1727000	and now they stopped selling Blu-ray discs to those damn traders.
1727000	1729000	This is the person with the really cool signature
1729000	1731000	that says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden,
1731000	1734000	home of Never Ending Salads.
1734000	1735000	And breadsticks.
1735000	1736000	Don't forget breadsticks.
1736000	1737000	I don't want any more salad.
1737000	1742000	It's going to be more salad for you.
1742000	1743000	Oh, never mind.
1743000	1744000	I was going to say something, but I lost.
1744000	1745000	My train derailed.
1745000	1746000	My train of thought.
1746000	1748000	The salad destroyed your train.
1748000	1750000	Because I started thinking about the Olive Garden,
1750000	1753000	and the Olive Garden is awesome.
1753000	1755000	Well, we have a long one.
1755000	1758000	Hurray for long emails.
1758000	1764000	It says this is actually being sent to us by,
1764000	1766000	well, if I just say Rick,
1766000	1768000	because he didn't put a nickname in there,
1768000	1770000	but it seems like he's from the UK.
1770000	1771000	That's cool.
1771000	1772000	Hi, guys.
1772000	1774000	Let me know if you get the reference.
1774000	1775000	Okay.
1775000	1777000	It started with GameSpot,
1777000	1779000	and then it expanded to IGN.
1779000	1782000	Then I found this link to OLR on a random podcast site.
1782000	1785000	Now my crack-like habit of listening to gaming podcasts
1785000	1787000	creeps into my working day.
1787000	1789000	Yours being the one I look forward to the most.
1789000	1790000	Oh, thank you.
1790000	1791000	Oh, thank you.
1791000	1792000	Cheerio.
1792000	1793000	Cheerio.
1793000	1794000	Now as my girlfriend is sleeping,
1794000	1796000	I must wait till tomorrow to download
1796000	1798000	and heat up my OLR fix on the spoon,
1798000	1800000	then inject it into my ears while striving to work
1800000	1803000	or pretending to concentrate on my PC screen at my desk,
1803000	1805000	stifling a few good laughs, I might add.
1805000	1806000	This guy is hardcore.
1806000	1807000	I love it.
1807000	1808000	Rad.
1808000	1809000	I own a Wii.
1809000	1813000	Now, I know it may not seem as a hardcore system,
1813000	1814000	but I love it.
1814000	1816000	I have owned every incarnation of Nintendo's system
1816000	1817000	and enjoyed them all.
1817000	1821000	Yes, even the N64 Dark was cool apart from the last level.
1821000	1824000	And I have never had a hardware failure with any of them
1824000	1826000	apart from when I made Smoke come out of the back
1826000	1830000	of my Super NES after playing Desert Strike for 24 hours solid.
1830000	1831000	Wow.
1831000	1832000	Hardcore.
1832000	1836000	I don't know if I'd say hardcore more so fanboy.
1836000	1837000	It's all right.
1837000	1838000	It's not a crime.
1838000	1842000	I recently bought a nice 32-inch Panasonic LCD TV,
1842000	1845000	and I was excited by the thought of mating my Wii
1845000	1846000	with my new tele.
1846000	1847000	Yes, I'm from England.
1847000	1848000	See, I told you.
1848000	1852000	To make sweet love and produce a little bundle of gaming joy.
1852000	1855000	To my confusion, I seemed to have funny little dots
1855000	1856000	all over the screen.
1856000	1857000	Then I played Resident Evil 4.
1857000	1860000	I was horrified to see it looked like a crusty pile
1860000	1862000	of burst hemorrhoids.
1862000	1863000	That's beautiful.
1863000	1864000	Ew.
1864000	1865000	After frantically searching the internet,
1865000	1867000	I found that the problem was with the video card
1867000	1868000	on the Wii overheating.
1868000	1870000	I rang the nice people in Nintendo and sent it away.
1870000	1872000	And after two weeks, they returned it back to me all fixed.
1872000	1874000	Now, I am happy to say it all looks fab.
1874000	1876000	Is this a common fault?
1876000	1879000	I have never heard any of this on any podcast before.
1879000	1881000	The 360 has its own podcast named
1881000	1883000	after its notorious issues.
1883000	1884000	Anyway, keep up the good work.
1884000	1886000	I would love to hear my email on your show,
1886000	1888000	as I am a big fan and you always seem to have fun.
1888000	1890000	And you guys are very knowledgeable and,
1890000	1891000	more importantly, impartial.
1891000	1892000	Stay independent.
1892000	1896000	I love how he says that after a previous listener stumped us.
1896000	1897000	That's all right.
1897000	1898000	Note to Loki and Sky.
1898000	1901000	Every time Dark Soccer reads all the emails and says,
1901000	1902000	you should do the same.
1902000	1906000	My response, though, back to that first one
1906000	1908000	about the PlayStation game.
1908000	1909000	I played on the Dreamcast.
1909000	1910000	It came out on the Dreamcast.
1910000	1914000	It's a lot easier to get it to play on the Dreamcast.
1914000	1916000	Yes.
1916000	1917000	What the?
1917000	1918000	You found?
1918000	1919000	Why is it making that noise?
1919000	1921000	Oh, because I forgot to hit stop earlier
1921000	1923000	and it was playing the Portal song from earlier.
1923000	1926000	But anyway, I did find that...
1926000	1927000	Sorry, the show.
1927000	1929000	The show was a lie.
1929000	1931000	No, but what it was is that apparently
1931000	1934000	we found some information on the game on IGN.
1934000	1937000	Apparently it was a cooking simulator
1937000	1940000	and it was the first DualShock enhanced cooking simulator on the market.
1940000	1942000	No, it wasn't on the Dreamcast.
1942000	1943000	It just came out the same day as the Dreamcast.
1943000	1945000	But they did have a demo in the US.
1945000	1946000	Whatever.
1946000	1947000	On the PlayStation Underground.
1947000	1948000	There you have it.
1948000	1949000	So it was a cooking game.
1949000	1950000	Maybe that's why they thought you would know
1950000	1952000	because you are a Cooking Mama fan extraordinaire.
1952000	1954000	So maybe this is one of those classic games
1954000	1955000	you need to go back and find.
1955000	1958000	I've been over Cooking Mama for about a month now, you know.
1958000	1959000	Dude, the sequel's out.
1959000	1961000	I know. I have to get it.
1961000	1962000	Anyway, I wanted to say...
1962000	1963000	I want to make a cake.
1963000	1966000	I wanted to say to our hardcore fan overseas
1966000	1968000	that you are not the first person to have an exploding Wii.
1968000	1972000	That particular issue, I think, is the first time I've heard of that.
1972000	1976000	Certainly nobody else I've ever heard compares it to hemorrhoid, whatever.
1976000	1977000	That was kind of weird.
1977000	1981000	But, you know, every system is going to have some that break.
1981000	1984000	You know, there's just some faulty stuff on the assembly line.
1984000	1985000	Anything that comes off an assembly line
1985000	1987000	is going to have a fault once in a while.
1987000	1990000	That game Counter Force kind of looked like a bursting hemorrhoid,
1990000	1993000	but, you know, that's just that game, I guess.
1993000	1994000	So...
1994000	1997000	But the problem was, at least with the Xbox 360,
1997000	1999000	that Red Rings of Death was very prevalent.
1999000	2001000	A lot of people had that issue,
2001000	2004000	and that's why it's become almost like a pop culture gag
2004000	2005000	within the gaming scene.
2005000	2006000	And you do have...
2006000	2008000	I didn't know there was a podcast called Red Rings of Death,
2008000	2009000	but I'm somehow not surprised.
2009000	2011000	I mean, that's why it's become such a phenomenon
2011000	2014000	and why Microsoft had to specifically extend the warranty.
2014000	2018000	To Nintendo's credit, they've managed to kind of squelch
2018000	2020000	a lot of the people complaining about this
2020000	2022000	because apparently their customer service is very good.
2022000	2025000	And as you say, they got your Wii back to you
2025000	2028000	in a couple weeks there, just brand spanking new,
2028000	2030000	and I'm imagining they didn't charge you anything for it, so...
2030000	2033000	And they also take out hits on people that complain.
2033000	2034000	Yes.
2034000	2036000	Nintendo has their own ninja task force.
2036000	2038000	If you dare talk smack about Reggie,
2038000	2040000	those guys will come to your door and say,
2040000	2044000	Wii would like to play with guns.
2044000	2045000	And your head.
2045000	2046000	So there's more.
2046000	2047000	More.
2047000	2048000	Can I finish the email?
2048000	2049000	More.
2049000	2050000	Thank you.
2050000	2052000	Spelled M-O-A-R.
2052000	2053000	P.S.
2053000	2056000	Where the fuck is my strategy game for the Wii?
2056000	2058000	Surely it's perfect for Command & Conquer.
2058000	2061000	I would even settle for Red Alert Graphics.
2061000	2062000	Is that asking too much?
2062000	2063000	Yes.
2063000	2066000	Okay, then Tiberium Wars?
2066000	2068000	Okay.
2068000	2070000	Are there any strategy games bound for the Wii?
2070000	2072000	Battle Advance Wars?
2072000	2074000	Battalion Wars 2, maybe.
2074000	2076000	And then Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn.
2076000	2077000	Nice.
2077000	2080000	But Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, unfortunately,
2080000	2084000	is apparently very much like the last game that came out on the GameCube,
2084000	2086000	almost exactly the same.
2086000	2088000	But we like Fire Emblem.
2088000	2091000	I just hate playing strategy games myself.
2091000	2093000	Oh, and a question for me.
2093000	2095000	Did you ever play Cannon Fodder?
2095000	2098000	This is an awesome game, also should be remade for the Wii.
2098000	2101000	War has never been so much fun, and so on.
2101000	2102000	I know of it.
2102000	2104000	I actually have not played it.
2104000	2105000	That sounds familiar.
2105000	2107000	I've never played it either.
2107000	2110000	Yet another game stumping the panel here at Orange Line.
2110000	2112000	No, I think I did play it, but I just...
2112000	2114000	We've talked about Cannon Fodder on the show before.
2114000	2116000	I thought, hmm?
2116000	2121000	Back in a while, but I do believe that we have.
2121000	2125000	As in our chat room, Cannon Fodder was good, General Chaos was better.
2125000	2128000	See, when in doubt, when we're stumped, we always have the chat room
2128000	2131000	and plenty of people there to rely on their gaming knowledge as well.
2131000	2133000	There's one more last bit to this email.
2133000	2135000	Wow, this goes on forever.
2135000	2137000	Bye.
2137000	2139000	It's capitalized, so I'd say it that way.
2139000	2140000	All right.
2140000	2141000	Goodbye.
2141000	2143000	Last email.
2143000	2145000	Dearest OLR.
2145000	2147000	Oh, well, that's so sweet of you.
2147000	2148000	I know.
2148000	2151000	A journey of dreams and a new samba de amigo coming to Wii
2151000	2155000	and Rez coming to Xbox Live Arcade, which I think was Sega.
2155000	2157000	It seems Sega is what?
2157000	2158000	They published it.
2158000	2159000	Yeah.
2159000	2160000	Yeah, they published it, yeah.
2160000	2163000	It seems Sega is giving gamers a chance to play some of their better games
2163000	2165000	that were probably missed by most people.
2165000	2166000	Ow.
2166000	2169000	Some of those that should have been missed.
2169000	2171000	Should have remained missed, yes.
2171000	2174000	If this is the case, I was wondering what Sega games you would like to see remade
2174000	2177000	slash sequelized slash playable again.
2177000	2180000	Originally, I would love to see Space Channel 5 on Wii,
2180000	2183000	and it's one of the few games I would like to play by shaking the Wii mode around,
2183000	2186000	but only if Space Michael still has a part in it.
2186000	2188000	You took my answer, Jerardimo.
2188000	2190000	You took my answer, Jerardimo, you jerk.
2190000	2193000	That's exactly what I would have said to Space Channel 5.
2193000	2194000	Now what am I going to say?
2194000	2195000	Space Channel 5, too.
2195000	2200000	No, for real, because the Space Michael levels are so much better.
2200000	2202000	I love the Pudding Guitar battle.
2202000	2203000	That's my favorite.
2203000	2207000	Yeah, but the Space Michael levels are versus battles
2207000	2212000	where each side does different dances from the different videos.
2212000	2216000	They even do the freaking thriller dance, and I think that's fantastic.
2216000	2220000	How about another Crazy Taxi game, but like a good one, not a cheap knockoff.
2220000	2223000	Crazy Taxi kind of jumped the shark because there was sequel after sequel.
2223000	2226000	How about a remade really good Crazy Taxi
2226000	2229000	that has more than just the offspring as the music?
2229000	2231000	They had bad religion.
2231000	2232000	Oh, sorry.
2232000	2233000	Jet Set Radio.
2233000	2234000	Yeah.
2234000	2235000	Good answer.
2235000	2237000	That's another thing that we need is definitely another Jet Set Radio
2237000	2240000	because I freaking love that game.
2240000	2242000	Odd One agrees with that, Jet Set Radio.
2242000	2245000	Doing the graffiti with the Wiimote would be awesome in the chat room there.
2245000	2246000	GS68 says...
2246000	2248000	Well, because you'd have to do it in that pattern, right?
2248000	2251000	GS68 says Space Harrier and fuck Planet Harrier.
2251000	2253000	Planet Harrier, okay.
2253000	2257000	I love Space Harrier, but the thing is that I could not imagine
2257000	2259000	Space Harrier updated.
2259000	2262000	The best version, now...
2262000	2268000	They did Space Harrier for the Sega Aegis 2900, didn't they?
2268000	2272000	Yeah, because I think I have that one, but I love playing, actually.
2272000	2276000	My favorite thing to play Space Harrier on at home is the 32X
2276000	2279000	because it is the arcade version.
2279000	2281000	You can even reset some of the modes in that
2281000	2283000	to where it brings up all the arcade attract stuff.
2283000	2287000	I got one for you that's perfect for Xbox Live, Fantasy Zone.
2287000	2289000	Oh, hell yeah.
2289000	2291000	They probably need to put out Fantasy Zone.
2291000	2293000	Except, I think that would be kind of...
2293000	2296000	You would have to do it, though, classic controller only, I think.
2296000	2298000	Or, how about...
2298000	2302000	You know what game we haven't seen an incarnation of in a long time is Alex Kidd.
2302000	2304000	Bring me some Alex Kidd.
2304000	2308000	You know what's actually going to be coming out here pretty soon in January, I think,
2308000	2311000	is that Sega Bass Fishing.
2311000	2313000	Sounds like fun.
2313000	2316000	Well, let's remember the one on the Dreamcast with the fishing rod.
2316000	2318000	Yeah, with the rod caliber.
2318000	2320000	Yeah, that game gave us rod caliber.
2320000	2322000	Good times.
2322000	2324000	I know that I've mentioned this on the show a bunch of times,
2324000	2327000	but you could play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod, and it was really cool.
2327000	2330000	You know, you can actually play that Soul Calibur Legends.
2330000	2333000	They have that fishing rod that comes with Hooked, real motion fishing.
2333000	2335000	Have you tried it?
2335000	2337000	No, I have not tried that game because...
2337000	2341000	Well, one, I don't want to buy Hooked because it's a fishing game.
2341000	2343000	I don't fish.
2343000	2345000	I don't find fishing fun.
2345000	2348000	Simulating fishing, I think, would be even less fun.
2348000	2351000	Yeah.
2351000	2354000	I don't know.
2354000	2357000	Anyways, any more emails?
2357000	2361000	We actually got one from RobWithTwoBees
2361000	2364000	that's a link to a story about a boy who hired a hitman
2364000	2366000	to kill his parents for PlayStation punishment.
2366000	2369000	That's funny.
2369000	2373000	A boy, these parents told their son they couldn't play his PlayStation
2373000	2378000	for poor grades and bad behavior, and the son tried to hire a hitman.
2378000	2381000	Oh my god! What's this world coming to?
2381000	2384000	These people in Maryland,
2384000	2387000	Shannon and Joey Troiano from Maryland
2387000	2390000	punished their son Cory by confiscating their PlayStation
2390000	2393000	and hiding it and banned him from watching TV.
2393000	2397000	So he tried to hire a hitman.
2397000	2401000	And his mom actually set him up for a sting.
2401000	2406000	God, that kid's retarded. What in the hell is wrong with this family?
2406000	2411000	He promised that he would give him his stepfather's new pickup
2411000	2415000	as payment for killing his parents.
2415000	2417000	And then he was arrested.
2417000	2419000	And somebody was actually going to kill these people over a pickup?
2419000	2422000	No, it was... What's this world coming to?
2422000	2425000	Maybe it was a really nice pickup.
2425000	2428000	I somehow doubt that. That's crazy talk.
2428000	2431000	Wow. Wow. And she's quoted as saying,
2431000	2434000	I miss him being at home, and I miss us joking around and kidding around,
2434000	2436000	but in the same breath, I don't know what this kid will do
2436000	2438000	because that's not my son.
2438000	2440000	That can't be my little boy sitting there.
2440000	2442000	Wow.
2442000	2446000	It said that his behavior got worse ever since his father left.
2446000	2450000	It's like Rosemary's Baby or the omen or something crazy there.
2450000	2452000	Wow.
2452000	2455000	Any more emails to depress us?
2455000	2458000	It said he dropped out of school and stole 45 bucks.
2458000	2461000	Wow. This guy sounds like a real winner.
2461000	2462000	Yeah, that's it.
2462000	2463000	That's it for emails.
2463000	2465000	If you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
2465000	2467000	Meanwhile, more news.
2467000	2469000	News.
2469000	2472000	Anyways, so some pretty cool stuff.
2472000	2478000	According to Valve, they're adding the Orange Box games
2478000	2481000	to the Source Software Development Kit.
2481000	2483000	So that means that you guys can go out there
2483000	2486000	and make some cool new levels and mods and whatnot
2486000	2491000	for Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2
2491000	2493000	and all sorts of fun stuff.
2493000	2494000	Let's see here.
2494000	2496000	God, we're going to see shitloads of portal mods.
2496000	2499000	Included in the Software Development Kit
2499000	2501000	are the Hammer World Editor,
2501000	2504000	which provides the capability of creating custom levels
2504000	2506000	for Source Engine-based games,
2506000	2510000	Valve's custom Face Poser tool that allows users
2510000	2514000	to produce choreographed sequences in the Source Engine,
2514000	2517000	a Model Viewer that allows artists
2517000	2520000	to preview models and animations quickly,
2520000	2522000	a Source Code that allows mod makers
2522000	2525000	to create their own games based off of Half-Life 2
2525000	2527000	or Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,
2527000	2532000	and all the tools required to make, build custom textures
2532000	2535000	and models for Source Engine games.
2535000	2540000	So, that's a whole lot of cool stuff.
2540000	2543000	And I've actually seen, there were some custom maps out there,
2543000	2545000	or mods or something like that, with a portal
2545000	2549000	that actually had some gravity modifiers in there as well,
2549000	2552000	like different sections of the map had different gravity and whatnot.
2552000	2557000	So that'd be kind of cool.
2557000	2559000	Wow, all right.
2559000	2561000	Well, I definitely, you know, I'm looking forward to seeing
2561000	2562000	some of the mods you're going to do,
2562000	2564000	and I would say it's only a matter of time
2564000	2566000	before we get a mod for Portal,
2566000	2568000	where the cake will, in fact, be truth.
2568000	2569000	Actually...
2569000	2570000	What?
2570000	2572000	And people are saying these are Easter eggs,
2572000	2574000	but I think they're more in-game glitches.
2574000	2576000	You can actually get to their room at the end of the credits
2576000	2577000	where the cake is.
2577000	2579000	Hmm. Interesting.
2579000	2580000	Yeah.
2580000	2582000	Hacks, mad hacks, game genies.
2582000	2584000	No, there's ways, if you put in the code
2584000	2587000	where you can shoot portals anywhere on any surface,
2587000	2590000	you can actually get it to where you can clip through the walls sometimes.
2590000	2591000	Yeah.
2591000	2594000	But there's also, I think it is kind of cool
2594000	2596000	that the whole credit sequence,
2596000	2600000	when you're going through where the pipes are,
2600000	2602000	you can actually...
2602000	2604000	There is a glitch where you can go into that area
2604000	2607000	because it is fully rendered and in the game.
2607000	2609000	Well, there's been a healthy donation
2609000	2613000	of some SimCity made by EA.
2613000	2617000	You've probably heard of the One Laptop Per Child program.
2617000	2618000	This is something where, like,
2618000	2620000	they were going to actually put laptops in classrooms
2620000	2624000	in other countries for children in the classroom.
2624000	2628000	Well, EA has actually donated the original version of SimCity
2628000	2631000	to be pre-installed on all machines.
2631000	2634000	So, kind of interesting, a very classic game, SimCity.
2634000	2636000	It kind of teaches you something about city management
2636000	2640000	and certainly uses logic and a lot of other skills in the game.
2640000	2642000	So there you have it.
2642000	2644000	Being donated by Electronic Arts
2644000	2647000	for every one of those $100 laptops.
2647000	2649000	That's pretty cool.
2649000	2650000	Donations are cool, but seriously,
2650000	2652000	couldn't they have pwned in the money for SimCity 2000?
2652000	2653000	No, I'm just kidding.
2653000	2654000	The classic is way better.
2654000	2655000	I hate SimCity 2000.
2655000	2657000	Well, it's also the laptop's pretty old.
2657000	2658000	I mean, well, not $100.
2658000	2659000	They're 100 bucks. Hello.
2659000	2662000	The processor in it is not exactly powerful and stuff, so...
2662000	2664000	Okay, look, as long as they play Oregon Trail,
2664000	2665000	what else do you need?
2665000	2666000	That's what kids need in this school.
2666000	2667000	Exactly. That should have been Oregon Trail.
2667000	2669000	So then they would need a Mac.
2669000	2672000	Or just an Apple IIe with the green monitor.
2672000	2673000	Apple IIe.
2673000	2674000	Those things for the shit.
2674000	2677000	And I want all these kids to learn Logo.
2677000	2678000	Oh.
2678000	2679000	Pen down.
2679000	2680000	Forward 20.
2680000	2681000	Right 90.
2681000	2682000	Forward 20.
2682000	2683000	Right 90.
2683000	2684000	Hey, guess what?
2684000	2686000	Atari 2600 News.
2686000	2693000	The Atari 2600 has been inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame
2693000	2696000	at the Strong National Museum of Play.
2696000	2700000	You know what the other two things that were inducted were along with it?
2700000	2701000	Raggedy Ann.
2701000	2702000	No, Raggedy Andy.
2702000	2703000	Sorry.
2703000	2704000	And the kite.
2704000	2709000	Like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but with toys.
2709000	2716000	The museum's curator has said that the Atari system paved the way for today's gaming consoles
2716000	2722000	and quote mesmerized a generation with games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Frogger.
2722000	2724000	The kite.
2724000	2726000	So that's pretty cool.
2726000	2737000	Yeah, apparently it's also in there with the teddy bear roller skates and Mr. Potato Head.
2737000	2739000	Is Light Bright in the Toy Hall of Fame?
2739000	2741000	I don't know, but it should be, dammit.
2741000	2742000	It should be, absolutely.
2742000	2745000	And before they made them crappy, I want the Light Brights that could like set on fire
2745000	2747000	if you played Light Bright for too long.
2747000	2749000	Because Light Bright is the greatest toy of all time.
2749000	2758000	And by the way, by the way, my classic computer love goes towards the Texas Instruments computer.
2758000	2759000	I want a Light Bright.
2759000	2760000	Let's make that happen.
2760000	2762000	I want a Light Bright so we can put O.L.R.
2762000	2763000	I had a Light Bright.
2763000	2764000	Did I tell you?
2764000	2766000	I swear to God we're going to like the flea market soon.
2766000	2770000	But the thing is that my peers would always get mad at me because I would have them buy
2770000	2775000	me extra dots and I would make my own pictures.
2775000	2777000	I would never use the things that came with them.
2777000	2778000	I made my own pictures.
2778000	2779000	I made patterns.
2779000	2780000	Patterns are my thing.
2780000	2782000	But you know what I found?
2782000	2785000	At a yard sale like a year ago, I found Transformers Light Bright patterns.
2785000	2786000	That's awesome.
2786000	2787000	So I kept them.
2787000	2788000	I bought them.
2788000	2789000	I totally want a Light Bright.
2789000	2791000	Can't you imagine putting a Light Bright here on the shelf?
2791000	2794000	Guys, listeners, find us a Light Bright.
2794000	2795000	We implore.
2795000	2796000	eBay?
2796000	2797000	I swear to God I'm going to yard sales.
2797000	2798000	I'm going to eBay right now.
2798000	2799000	Please do.
2799000	2805200	Anyways, in case you've been living under a rock, the Writers Guild of America is striking
2805200	2806200	right now.
2806200	2809200	I mean, it's just a surprise.
2809200	2816200	Anyways, so what that means is a lot of movie productions have halted and one of those movies
2816200	2824380	that's kind of been put on the brakes, I guess, Wolfenstein and Sci-Fi Wire apparently is
2824380	2831040	reporting that the script is almost done, but everything as far as the production date
2831040	2836280	and that kind of thing won't be decided until after all of this is over.
2836280	2845180	And of course, you know, Roger Avery fully supports the strike and yeah.
2845180	2851000	So darn, I guess we have to wait for a Wolfenstein movie.
2851000	2852000	Just a thought.
2852000	2854400	It's probably going to suck.
2854400	2855400	So take your time.
2855400	2856400	It's alright.
2856400	2860800	And if the movie sucks, I will go on strike from doing this program.
2860800	2864800	There was somebody commented, I want to say this on Any Cool News or something like that,
2864800	2869960	and I'm sure people have made the same kind of comments, that TV watchers and movie watchers
2869960	2874360	should have their own guild and strike when there's like crappy movies.
2874360	2875360	Refuse to watch them.
2875360	2879280	Why the hell does a light bright have $52 shipping on it?
2879280	2880280	Christ.
2880280	2881280	Sorry.
2881280	2882520	That's a light truck.
2882520	2885000	And then the ones, I found a light bright for 25 bucks.
2885000	2890000	Well, I think the whole Rider Strike thing does kind of, I mean, it's unfortunate.
2890000	2894960	Well, the reason why it has $52 shipping is probably because the sale price, if it's cheap
2894960	2899800	enough, they don't have to pay as much of an eBay tax, I guess, on that thing or the,
2899800	2904160	you know, eBay doesn't get as big of a portion and then that way they can just make it all
2904160	2905360	up in shipping.
2905360	2907240	That's cheap.
2907240	2908240	That's working the system.
2908240	2911520	They need to have one with a buy it now on here.
2911520	2912520	Alright.
2912520	2917840	And I would like to point out that Marissa in our chat room says light bright has become
2917840	2920120	modern with light bright flat screen.
2920120	2923680	Yeah, and I want an old one, like the one I had from 1982.
2923680	2927880	Can you find an Etch A Sketch while you're at it?
2927880	2930440	Okay, I found a 1986 light bright refill pack.
2930440	2931440	Rad.
2931440	2933720	We might have to get that so we get plenty of orange pegs.
2933720	2937800	Anyhow, something else from the 80s that is awesome is The Last Starfighter.
2937800	2939040	Yes.
2939040	2942840	And remember how The Last Starfighter had like a video game kind of in it, but it was
2942840	2943840	never actually a game?
2943840	2946720	It was supposed to be a game, but it wasn't.
2946720	2953000	Well, what happened is that this guy actually put together a copy of the Starfighter game
2953000	2955680	and actually put it in the cabinet.
2955680	2959680	Atari had made this full final version of the game, but they never actually put it out.
2959680	2965800	But thanks to the love and hardcoreness, for lack of a better term, of this guy, he can
2965800	2967160	now play Starfighter in his house.
2967160	2969600	I mean, this comes complete with like the levers and everything.
2969600	2971120	This isn't just in any old cabinet.
2971120	2974480	This isn't like an actual cabinet like the one from the movie.
2974480	2984000	If you want to see this for yourself, Roguesynapse.com, let me spell that for you guys, R-O-G-U-E-S-Y-N-A-P-S-E.com.
2984000	2985840	You found a virtual light bright?
2985840	2987520	One of our chatters linked it.
2987520	2988520	That's just not as cool.
2988520	2989520	I'm sorry to say.
2989520	2991800	I appreciate the effort.
2991800	2992800	So that's pretty cool.
2992800	2997120	So if you want to play Starfighter for yourself, head on over because they have a download
2997120	3002140	link on that page, Roguesynapse.com.
3002140	3003640	So moving on with the gaming news.
3003640	3006360	Dude, I was playing light bright, Rob.
3006360	3007360	Sorry.
3007360	3008360	Sorry.
3008360	3011760	Anyhoo, moving on.
3011760	3018560	For our anime fans in the chat room, there is a Persona 3 anime to be out in January.
3018560	3024680	Being put out by Aniplex's A-1 Pictures, they are adapting it for a...
3024680	3030320	It's actually going to be called Persona Trinity Soul in January 2008, which is set a decade
3030320	3039340	after the game and will center around three brothers in a city where the dead have turned
3039340	3040960	their skins inside out.
3040960	3041960	Ew.
3041960	3042960	Yeah.
3042960	3044080	I'll probably watch it.
3044080	3045080	That sounds really cool.
3045080	3048160	Is that kind of like that guy in PBS?
3048160	3049400	I don't think so.
3049400	3052920	There's a lot of people that love their Persona, so this is, I'm sure, good news to a lot of
3052920	3055360	the fans of Persona 3.
3055360	3057600	I think so.
3057600	3059600	Inside out, man.
3059600	3060600	Anyways.
3060600	3070080	So, speaking of eBay earlier, if you're desperate for some celebrity memorabilia, eBay of course
3070080	3076600	is the place to find it, and since this is vaguely game-related, Gary Coleman is selling
3076600	3077600	his GameCube.
3077600	3085800	Yes, times are pretty hard for old Gary, and of course he is signing his GameCube as well
3085800	3092320	as the games coming with it, which if I remember correctly there was one from Robots, the movie
3092320	3094840	of the game, and some other crap in there.
3094840	3098960	So let's see here.
3098960	3106040	So if you're interested in it, only $510 right now is the going price for it.
3106040	3111720	Let's see, it includes Mortal Kombat Deception, Super Smash Brothers Melee, Mario Kart Double
3111720	3118960	Dash, Sonic 2, Adventure Battle, and Sonic Gems Collection.
3118960	3120760	Nice.
3120760	3127680	And Gary Coleman has signed each one of those things, so now you can own a piece of Gary.
3127680	3129160	A little itty bitty piece.
3129160	3130720	He's welcome to keep it.
3130720	3135120	Former mayoral candidate, or I mean, gubernatorial candidate here in California.
3135120	3137720	You might remember when Gary Coleman ran for governor, remember?
3137720	3139480	He didn't even freakin' make the top ten.
3139480	3140480	I know.
3140480	3145680	Although, that one porn star did, she was in the top ten, the Mary Carey or whatever
3145680	3146680	she was.
3146680	3150160	Hey, I totally supported her because- Wasn't she like promising like a blowjob for everyone
3150160	3152160	that voted for her?
3152160	3153160	Probably.
3153160	3154160	That's my vote.
3154160	3158240	I would like to point out that, and I apologize if I'm butchering this name in our chat room,
3158240	3162520	Necro Arca in our chat room linked us to a Lite Brite Cube.
3162520	3165480	It's a modern version of the Lite Brite that's available on Amazon.
3165480	3167160	It's actually like four sides to it.
3167160	3170560	I know a cube has six sides, but the top and bottom don't actually do anything.
3170560	3172840	But that's kind of neat because you can put a pattern on every side.
3172840	3173840	That is pretty cool.
3173840	3175520	But I want an old school one, yo.
3175520	3176880	15 bucks for that.
3176880	3177880	No way.
3177880	3178880	I want an old, old one.
3178880	3179880	Yeah, I want an old school one.
3179880	3182080	Like the kind that gets so hot that you can't touch it.
3182080	3183080	I know.
3183080	3184640	Yeah, but you know what you can do with that?
3184640	3186680	Lite Brite companion cube.
3186680	3187680	Yes.
3187680	3189680	Good time.
3189680	3192840	You know what I'm going to do as soon as I learn how to sew?
3192840	3195960	I'm going to make myself a weighted companion cube purse.
3195960	3199600	People are crazy about their weighted companion cube.
3199600	3205040	I still have not played Portal, so these jokes go over my head.
3205040	3209120	But this joke I get, and I think it's hilarious, because one of the first games I ever remember
3209120	3212560	playing on the Commodore 64 was Zork.
3212560	3218800	And Zork has apparently been smooshed with Pac-Man to create this homegrown game, Packed
3218800	3225040	TXT, and it's available for play at pac-txt.com.
3225040	3227000	It's Pac-Man meets Zork.
3227000	3229640	And yes, it's as stupid as it sounds.
3229640	3232480	You actually play Pac-Man, but it's in Zork format.
3232480	3236920	In other words, you go, eat, and it says, you have eaten another glowing dot, and you
3236920	3237920	type forward.
3237920	3240360	You have moved forward.
3240360	3246540	So stupid, it's hilarious, but I'm sure it will get old in about five minutes.
3246540	3247880	There you have it.
3247880	3254880	Anyhow, if you would like to give us a call, our Skype line is now open for business, 1-877-game-over.
3254880	3261880	I doubt we'll have anything as exciting as the Nintendo World Store call from earlier,
3261880	3265000	and Zaku actually sounding not high this week.
3265000	3267280	But who knows?
3267280	3268640	I'm sure our folks will try.
3268640	3271920	So meanwhile, while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a delay, let's
3271920	3276520	see if there's any last minute stories from here in chat, or here in studio.
3276520	3278240	Hey, I'm not a chat.
3278240	3279240	I'm a me.
3279240	3280240	Sorry.
3280240	3281240	My bad.
3281240	3289480	Here's an interesting one, Eiji Onomura was interviewed in the last issue of Official
3289480	3295240	Nintendo Magazine, of course that's in the UK, talking about what his interests are in
3295240	3298200	the Legend of Zelda series and how he'd like to continue it.
3298200	3302560	One thing he's interested in doing is a 3D remake of A Link to the Past, which would
3302560	3303560	be fucking awesome.
3303560	3304560	So I hope they do that.
3304560	3305560	That would be fucking awesome.
3305560	3309200	And do it in the Wind Waker Engine, none of this fucking Twilight Princess shit.
3309200	3310400	Alright, we're getting a phone call.
3310400	3311400	Let's go take it.
3311400	3312400	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3312400	3313400	Who's this?
3313400	3314400	Oh my god, I'm on.
3314400	3317240	This is Odd1 from the chat room.
3317240	3319760	I'm sorry, what was your name again?
3319760	3320760	Wow.
3320760	3321760	Odd1.
3321760	3322760	Odd1.
3322760	3323760	O-D-D-O-N-E.
3323760	3324760	Yeah.
3324760	3325760	You made it.
3325760	3326760	You're a first time live listener tonight, right?
3326760	3330960	Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for years while I was working.
3330960	3336280	You guys got me through some really tough, long hours, and I'm so grateful to you guys.
3336280	3337280	Wow.
3337280	3338280	I just want to say thanks.
3338280	3339280	Thank you.
3339280	3343880	It's words like that that seriously keep us motivated, because we do this.
3343880	3346960	We don't make any money off of it, unlike some of the other podcasts out there that
3346960	3350320	are just out there to support their magazines and websites and stuff.
3350320	3351920	So thank you very much.
3351920	3352920	That's very flattering.
3352920	3353920	I do this for Monopoly money.
3353920	3354920	Oh, sorry.
3354920	3356920	I do this for Monopoly money.
3356920	3360680	Yeah, you take beer for the love, and it shows.
3360680	3361680	That's true.
3361680	3362680	Dark Soccer gets free beer out of this.
3362680	3363680	I get free beer.
3363680	3367240	So when we have extra beer, Dark Soccer comes to my house and drinks all my beer.
3367240	3370360	Anyway, what's on your mind, Audwin?
3370360	3373160	Honestly, I didn't think I'd get through.
3373160	3374160	I don't have much on my mind.
3374160	3378560	I just wanted to say thanks, and now that I get free time, I'm going to be listening
3378560	3380160	live every week.
3380160	3383200	Seriously, you guys are just the best.
3383200	3384200	You're welcome.
3384200	3385200	Thank you so much.
3385200	3386200	Well, then tell us about your gaming week real quick.
3386200	3387200	We'll ask you questions.
3387200	3388200	Oh, my God.
3388200	3389200	How is your gaming week?
3389200	3391200	What games have you been playing?
3391200	3395000	Man, all I got here is a GameCube right now.
3395000	3398280	Is it Gary Coleman's GameCube?
3398280	3401880	It's no good at all.
3401880	3404600	Okay, well, the GameCube's not horrible.
3404600	3408560	I'm assuming it's a money thing, which is why you don't have the next-gen systems.
3408560	3412520	It's a money thing.
3412520	3415160	It's a stolen system thing.
3415160	3416760	I don't even want to go into it.
3416760	3421480	All right, well, let's say you had $400 in your pocket right now, enough to buy any of
3421480	3422500	the next-gen systems.
3422500	3424500	Which one would you buy and why?
3424500	3431440	You know, I'd probably buy a Wii and about 20 million of those Wii points because, especially
3431440	3435520	with the Neo Geo, the Virtual Console is just hot.
3435520	3437160	I need that in my life.
3437160	3438160	It is hot.
3438160	3442120	Like, seriously, my Wii wasn't even plugged in for about three weeks.
3442120	3444920	And I finally went and plugged it back in today because I wanted to check out some of
3444920	3448160	the new stuff like the Check Me Out channel and Mario 3.
3448160	3452200	And I went back on, and I saw that Simon's Quest was on Virtual Console, and I completely
3452200	3453200	forgot about it.
3453200	3456440	And when I saw it, I seriously, I think I got a semi.
3456440	3459480	Like, that game is so awesome.
3459480	3462320	Even with the shitty translation, it's fun.
3462320	3464840	What a terrible night to have a curse.
3464840	3465840	That game.
3465840	3466840	The game is awesome.
3466840	3469520	Seriously, one of the best soundtracks of all time.
3469520	3472960	So yeah, just lots of choice.
3472960	3476360	And I know people say, just play them in emulators for free and blah, blah, blah.
3476360	3477360	But I don't know.
3477360	3481080	There's something rewarding about having the authentic experience because you know Nintendo,
3481080	3485560	you know, it's coming from the official source, and the fact that I can play it on my HDTV,
3485560	3486560	like in the old school Nintendo.
3486560	3487560	I don't know.
3487560	3490600	There's something about that that for whatever reason, maybe I'm just lazy and don't want
3490600	3494760	to hook up the whole like Dreamcast and burn the CD or whatever.
3494760	3499320	There's something about it that just, I don't know, is worth the five bucks.
3499320	3503960	Well I mean, and also, you know, I associate my computer with work.
3503960	3508880	I'll play on it, but you know, when I want to relax, I get on my couch and turn on my
3508880	3509880	TV.
3509880	3510880	That's a good point.
3510880	3511880	That's a good point.
3511880	3515480	Like I don't like to play games on the computer that were originally designed for the console.
3515480	3518720	Something like World of Warcraft or PC develop games, I have no problem playing those on
3518720	3519720	the PC.
3519720	3522940	Why do you think I have so many video game systems?
3522940	3524440	So you can sit on the couch.
3524440	3530880	So I can sit on my couch and use my original controller and play the game.
3530880	3532880	There you have it.
3532880	3533880	Exactly.
3533880	3535960	Alright, well I'm going to let you go.
3535960	3537520	Thank you so much for taking my call.
3537520	3538880	No problem Odd1.
3538880	3541040	It's very nice to hear such enthusiasm.
3541040	3542320	It makes us even more excited.
3542320	3543440	So thank you Odd1 for your call.
3543440	3544440	We appreciate it.
3544440	3545440	Have a good one.
3545440	3546440	Bye.
3546440	3547440	Bye bye.
3547440	3550840	He had just had so much enthusiasm, like was generally happy to be on the show.
3550840	3551840	I love that.
3551840	3552840	So great.
3552840	3553840	Thank you so much.
3553840	3554840	Let's go to another call.
3554840	3555840	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3555840	3556840	Who's this?
3556840	3557840	This is Zormay.
3557840	3558840	Hello, it's Zormay.
3558840	3559840	What's up with mine?
3559840	3568520	Yeah, I just wanted to talk about just like an overall gaming this year.
3568520	3573400	You know it's like this week, Mario Galaxy and Assassin's Creed is coming out.
3573400	3578440	Do y'all find it hard to keep up with all these games?
3578440	3587360	Like I know we have like, you're married, Loki, along with Dr. Kara.
3587360	3589160	This is a huge week for games.
3589160	3590400	Yeah, this is feedback.
3590400	3593840	I know this is, with Christmas and everything, it's just like everything is coming out this
3593840	3594840	week.
3594840	3601080	Well, I'm trying to say, do you need a chance to actually play them all?
3601080	3606560	Do you find yourself able to play them like as if you would play it, like do you get all
3606560	3610840	your fun out of them, like your money for it?
3610840	3612400	Do we have time to play all these games?
3612400	3613400	Oh, no.
3613400	3617360	Well, given all the other projects that I have going on myself, I don't have time.
3617360	3618360	Hold on.
3618360	3620560	We're getting the really bad echo, Zormay, so we're going to have to let you go, but
3620560	3622600	we'll answer your questions or keep listening to the show.
3622600	3625680	But unfortunately, we're getting the really bad echo, I'm sorry, buddy.
3625680	3628240	But let's answer the question, do we have time to play all these games that come out?
3628240	3632440	I personally do not, just given that I have a very busy schedule.
3632440	3636920	I know I'm also, I haven't gone into a lot of detail on this, but I'm working on an illustration
3636920	3637920	project.
3637920	3640920	I'm still going to classes as a massage therapist.
3640920	3643840	I work as a massage therapist, too.
3643840	3648320	And with my full-time job, I don't have as much time as I would like to play some of
3648320	3651440	these games, although I am dedicating time to Portal next week.
3651440	3655440	I wish I had more time for games, but I find myself the same problem with the day job and
3655440	3660400	relationships and everything, but here's my problem is that I keep coming back to the
3660400	3665280	freaking MMOs that suck my life away, and I'm talking about WoW, Final Fantasy XI, if
3665280	3669720	Jamie gets her way, Ragnarok, my friends trying to get me into Tabula Rasa, which I really
3669720	3670720	want to check out.
3670720	3674240	You know, there's just all these freaking MMOs I keep getting sucked into, and those
3674240	3677840	are games that never finish, so you just keep going back for more, and I never have time
3677840	3679160	to play the console games.
3679160	3681560	But I do try to play a little bit of everything.
3681560	3686160	That's what makes it so easy to stay on top of the Xbox Live Arcade releases and everything.
3686160	3689240	You know, those are delivered right to your doorstep, and they're usually really short
3689240	3690240	games.
3690240	3693380	I try to sample as much as I can, but I may not play everything.
3693380	3697640	For example, right now, when I was playing Portal, I wasn't playing Halo 3 or anything
3697640	3698640	else like that.
3698640	3703400	In Assassin's Creed, to be honest, I only played about 15 minutes of it today, and same
3703400	3707860	with Super Mario Galaxy, I think I maybe played half an hour of it.
3707860	3711720	I used to buy games left and right that I would probably only end up playing for like
3711720	3716060	an hour, but I've really learned to curb that this year, and I've seriously been a good
3716060	3719480	boy and not bought games that I don't plan on spending serious time with.
3719480	3723200	So that's my other problem, is that, you know, remember, we do this for the love of the game
3723200	3725280	because we're fans of gaming and everything.
3725280	3728080	We don't get a lot of free games from companies.
3728080	3732740	Once in a great while, we've gotten free games, and so, you know, if we had more free games,
3732740	3736500	we could easily dedicate, you know, an hour between three of us, you know, each playing
3736500	3737500	games or whatever.
3737500	3740080	The last free game I got was Dragon's Lair HD.
3740080	3742360	I can't remember the last free game we got.
3742360	3748000	Last free game I got, and I don't want it, and I will be selling it back, Viva Pinata
3748000	3749000	Party Animals.
3749000	3750000	Aw, sorry to hear it.
3750000	3751000	Well, I'll take that back.
3751000	3754680	Dan got us our Halo 3 for free, and a bunch of other stuff.
3754680	3759040	The last free one I can remember getting was the mid-way- a mid-way rep I met at a show
3759040	3763400	was kind enough to give me one of those arcade classics, which was great for me because I
3763400	3766920	loved that shit, those AD games, so that was cool, but that was a long time ago.
3766920	3767920	Oh no.
3767920	3768920	Play Overlord.
3768920	3770960	Folks in chat are suggesting Gamefly.
3770960	3772920	Yes, I will play Overlord, I swear.
3772920	3776960	I will step away from Final Fantasy XI this week, the crack, the crack, and play some
3776960	3777960	Overlord.
3777960	3778960	All right.
3778960	3780720	Skype line is still open if you want to give us a call.
3780720	3786040	Just a word of advice, call Echo 1-2-3 before you call us on the Skype, and that way you
3786040	3789580	can hear what you sound like, and you can hear if there's any, like, echoing or any
3789580	3790580	of that stuff.
3790580	3794180	If your microphone is really close to your speakers, that's what causes the echo, so
3794180	3795180	sorry.
3795180	3796180	It's okay.
3796180	3799000	Any other last minute stories real quick while we wait for some more calls?
3799000	3800480	Yeah, of course I do.
3800480	3804680	Anyways, Attack of the Show is now in the Guinness Book of World Records for creating
3804680	3808280	the largest arcade machine.
3808280	3816880	It is 1,300 pounds, has 150 arcade games built into it, 14 feet tall, and has a 75 inch screen,
3816880	3819440	plus it requires quarters that are 3 inches big.
3819440	3822840	They like big things on that program, don't they, because they made a big Nintendo once,
3822840	3823840	didn't they?
3823840	3824840	I remember that at 1E3.
3824840	3825840	They had that out there.
3825840	3827200	And I will one-up everything they do.
3827200	3828440	All right, let's go to the phones.
3828440	3829440	We have another call.
3829440	3830440	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3830440	3831440	Who's this?
3831440	3832440	Hello.
3832440	3833440	Hi.
3833440	3834440	Who is this?
3834440	3835440	Hello.
3835440	3836440	This is Marissa.
3836440	3837440	Hello.
3837440	3838440	Marissa!
3838440	3839440	Marissa!
3839440	3840440	Hey.
3840440	3841440	What's on your mind?
3841440	3843440	I was calling to say hello.
3843440	3846160	It's so nice to be able to hear the show this evening.
3846160	3847160	Yes.
3847160	3848160	It's a blast.
3848160	3849160	Very random that you're listening to us live.
3849160	3850160	Hello?
3850160	3851160	We love it.
3851160	3852160	I said it's very random that you're listening to us live.
3852160	3853160	We love it.
3853160	3854160	That's very cool.
3854160	3859560	I actually finally came across this thing known as a computer, and I purchased one.
3859560	3863000	I had been out of one for about a year because I just didn't have the money, but now I'm
3863000	3864000	back.
3864000	3868720	But I unfortunately have Windows Vista on a budget laptop, so I'm kind of screwed game
3868720	3869720	wise.
3869720	3870720	Excellent.
3870720	3875520	Now, since you have a new computer, has your gaming on the PC consisted of Solitaire and
3875520	3876520	Minesweeper?
3876520	3879600	Well, especially on Vista.
3879600	3885280	With what bloatware Vista is, yeah, because it eats all my memory.
3885280	3890880	Although I was lucky enough, I went to Target before going to Seattle to try to get some
3890880	3894880	games because I took a train trip to Seattle.
3894880	3899280	And so I wanted to have something to pass the time because it's like 38 hours.
3899280	3900280	And I got King's Quest.
3900280	3901280	Awesome.
3901280	3902280	King's Quest is the shit.
3902280	3911280	They re-released all of them onto, you know, it's supposed to be compatible with Windows
3911280	3915760	2000, but it doesn't work for Vista very well, but oh well, that was cool.
3915760	3918440	That sucks because the King's Quest series was amazing.
3918440	3921200	I loved those games when I was younger, especially King's Quest IV.
3921200	3924800	That was always my favorite because it was based on the fairy tales.
3924800	3925800	That was cool.
3925800	3928880	I basically bought a laptop and went backwards in time because the first thing I did was
3928880	3931800	get King's Quest and then the new Simon Max.
3931800	3932800	Very, very cool.
3932800	3933800	Very cool.
3933800	3937920	That was really cool, but I don't like these episodic games because I don't like paying
3937920	3940200	$20 for like half an hour worth of games.
3940200	3941200	Here's the thing.
3941200	3945280	You've got to get GameTap because not only are all the King's Quest games available on
3945280	3948440	there, but they also have the Sam and Max, but the only bummer is you have to have an
3948440	3950960	internet connection, so it's not so great for the train.
3950960	3954320	But you know, you can play for like $9.85 a month all the new Sam and Max games.
3954320	3959160	God, I sound like a commercial, but I wouldn't hype it up if it wasn't good.
3959160	3960160	I mean, it is good.
3960160	3963160	I think they've done a good thing, and I know a lot of people are rightfully so skeptical
3963160	3966840	about GameTap, but I think overall in the big picture, I mean, they've got like a thousand
3966840	3968960	games on there, classics, new stuff.
3968960	3973360	I mean, Overlord is available on GameTap and some other stuff, so it's good.
3973360	3974360	It's a good thing.
3974360	3975360	Oh, sweet.
3975360	3976360	Old stuff for me.
3976360	3977360	Otherwise, the dude bought an Xbox.
3977360	3978360	Oh, really?
3978360	3986640	Yeah, so now I've spent my evenings falling asleep in front of the TV while he plays Medal
3986640	3987640	of Honor.
3987640	3988640	Good times.
3988640	3989640	Good times.
3989640	3990640	Good times.
3990640	3991640	He dates up in a 360, right?
3991640	3992640	Yes.
3992640	3997800	I'm going to have to talk to you later to get his gamertag, and I'll give you Dan's
3997800	3998800	and mine.
3998800	3999800	Oh, quite simple.
3999800	4000800	Long hair Chris.
4000800	4001800	Long hair Chris.
4001800	4002800	Oh, that makes...
4002800	4003800	That's a castle, my boyfriend.
4003800	4004800	There you go.
4004800	4008120	You do know like thousands of people that hear our show just heard that, right?
4008120	4010840	If you get some more friend requests this week, you'll know why.
4010840	4016000	Well, okay, I'll go ahead and put Dan's on there, except I can't remember if it's with
4016000	4018800	an underscore or not, but it would be Gunstar Hero.
4018800	4019800	Okay.
4019800	4024800	So, I'll let you know for sure later, and mine I never use, so I'll let you know later.
4024800	4029280	But if he's got Halo 3, he should totally play with Dan so I can see Dan get punked.
4029280	4030280	Let's all play Uno.
4030280	4031280	He's waiting for that, yeah.
4031280	4033840	I'm not trying to talk him into getting the orange box, because I really want to play
4033840	4034840	Portal.
4034840	4035840	Yeah.
4035840	4036840	And he won't stop singing the song.
4036840	4038840	Isn't the song great?
4038840	4042680	Okay, I didn't get it at first, and it was when I finally saw it that I was like, this
4042680	4044680	is the best song ever.
4044680	4045680	Seriously, Jamie was...
4045680	4048720	I remember when that song was in the cage match, and Jamie was like, this song is stupid.
4048720	4049720	Why do people love this song?
4049720	4053840	Well, no, I said as a song without a frame of reference, it wasn't a very good song,
4053840	4057520	but now that I have the framework, now that I logged into that stupid site and took the
4057520	4062800	quiz that was on it, the personality thing, I was like, holy crap, this is messed up.
4062800	4063800	I love it.
4063800	4068480	Okay, yes, I think that's why it is so cool, although it does bring a different dimension
4068480	4071520	of weird when your coworker is singing it in a high-pitched falsetto while you're on
4071520	4072520	the phone with a client.
4072520	4073520	Oh, that's cool.
4073520	4074520	Nice.
4074520	4075520	Well, Marissa...
4075520	4076520	Oh, how'd you guys go?
4076520	4077520	It was great catching up.
4077520	4080800	Marissa, please, please log into Xbox Live sometime and we'll play Uno.
4080800	4082480	Oh, sweet.
4082480	4084520	And I'll hook up my webcam and play Strip Uno.
4084520	4085520	No, just kidding.
4085520	4088520	Do you have an Amazon wish list ready?
4088520	4090520	I can't wait.
4090520	4091520	All right.
4091520	4093520	Come on, baby.
4093520	4096200	Marissa, thanks so much for calling.
4096200	4097200	We love you.
4097200	4098200	Bye, Marissa.
4098200	4100200	Come back and be in the studio soon, okay?
4100200	4101200	Okay, bye.
4101200	4102200	All right, bye.
4102200	4107440	She has to come back soon so we can hear more stories about the Wunderbra.
4107440	4109040	These Wunderbra ears.
4109040	4110040	That was it.
4110040	4111040	I thought it was the Wunderbra.
4111040	4112040	Great.
4112040	4115720	All right, more last-minute stories.
4115720	4119800	We'll take one more call if anybody calls in, 877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange
4119800	4120800	Launch Radio.
4120800	4127480	Anyways, there's apparently a new Bioshock achievement that someone spotted on Live.
4127480	4134000	The rumor is the 51st achievement, which is actually on the list there, is 100 points
4134000	4135520	and it is from...
4135520	4136520	It's called Bulletproof.
4136520	4140840	Complete the game on hard difficulty without using a Vited Chamber.
4140840	4145280	So be interesting to see if this actually surfaces maybe in a new update or something
4145280	4147280	like that.
4147280	4151160	Anyways, let's see here.
4151160	4155160	Benjokazooie3, not coming out in 360 anymore.
4155160	4156160	It's been axed.
4156160	4157160	So, hooray.
4157160	4158160	Oh, wait.
4158160	4159920	There was something about...
4159920	4163980	I saw on Twitter that there was going to be big news coming out about a 360 exclusive
4163980	4164980	being axed.
4164980	4165980	This must be it.
4165980	4166980	This is the one.
4166980	4167980	Oh, snap.
4167980	4168980	All right.
4168980	4169980	We're getting one more call.
4169980	4170980	Oh, it went away.
4170980	4171980	Never mind.
4171980	4175640	One more thing to kind of go back to the MAME cabinet we were talking about earlier.
4175640	4176640	Game Raider.
4176640	4179380	It brings together MAME and beer.
4179380	4182360	It's a beer tap in a MAME cabinet.
4182360	4183360	Hold that thought.
4183360	4184360	We got a call coming in.
4184360	4187360	I do want to hear more about the beer thing, but this is a conference call, so I'm always
4187360	4188360	worried about these calls.
4188360	4189360	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4189360	4190360	Who's this?
4190360	4191360	Tekken Game Podcast.
4191360	4192360	Hi.
4192360	4193580	The Bucket, Toki's and Raiden's Dolphin.
4193580	4195280	What's up, you guys?
4195280	4196280	Not much.
4196280	4197280	You were talking about Sam & Max?
4197280	4198280	Yes.
4198280	4201800	Our last caller, Marissa, is a Sam & Max fan.
4201800	4202800	I am huge.
4202800	4207080	I beat the new one today, and oh my God, it's awesome.
4207080	4208080	Is it?
4208080	4210160	About how long of gaming was it?
4210160	4213340	About five hours, but they really changed up some things about it.
4213340	4218520	They added Stinky's Tavern as a restaurant, 50's theme.
4218520	4220520	Really nice.
4220520	4221520	I really love it.
4221520	4223320	And Santa goes nuts.
4223320	4224320	Can't go wrong with that.
4224320	4225320	Lots of fun.
4225320	4226320	Lots of fun stuff.
4226320	4227880	Those are great.
4227880	4231720	Is this taking a lot of time on your show recently, the Sam & Max series?
4231720	4232720	No.
4232720	4233720	Call of Duty.
4233720	4235720	Call of Duty.
4235720	4236720	Well that's cool.
4236720	4237720	Sam & Max is a good franchise.
4237720	4241640	One of those ones I need to spend more time with, but those damn MMOs, you know how it
4241640	4242640	goes.
4242640	4243640	No.
4243640	4247720	Yeah, but this one has a hit feature, so it's much easier for the noobs to get in.
4247720	4253320	Marissa, in our chat room, actually follows up and says, Sam & Max rules, but Indiana
4253320	4257640	Jones and the fate of Atlantis is still number one in my heart.
4257640	4258640	How about Loom?
4258640	4259640	That's fine.
4259640	4260640	Where's the love for Loom?
4260640	4261640	Loom is great.
4261640	4262640	Loom is awesome.
4262640	4263640	Loom.
4263640	4265280	Well, what else did you guys want to share with us?
4265280	4266280	Anything else?
4266280	4268360	Over alerts on GameTap, download it from there.
4268360	4271720	Well, I have a copy on Xbox 360, and that way I can get achievement points because I'm
4271720	4272800	a whore for achievement points.
4272800	4273800	Ah, you're right.
4273800	4274800	Yep.
4274800	4275800	I can play Jericho or something on GameTap.
4275800	4276800	Ah, Jericho.
4276800	4277800	Didn't Jericho suck?
4277800	4281240	Well, I've heard that, but I want to see that firsthand, if it does suck.
4281240	4284360	Okay, because that's what everyone said to me, like, big disappointment, it sucks, stay
4284360	4285360	away.
4285360	4287080	Yeah, that's what I keep hearing, but I like to see these things firsthand.
4287080	4291000	I will tell you what kind of cool zombie game I've been playing on GameTap is Typing of
4291000	4292000	the Dead.
4292000	4293000	That game is shit.
4293000	4294000	Oh, that's awesome.
4294000	4295000	I've been playing that a little.
4295000	4297840	It's a steep learning curve to get all those letters in.
4297840	4299040	I can type uber fast.
4299040	4301920	Maybe because you can't type, Raven.
4301920	4304800	You type with two fingers, Raven, that you're not going to get very far doing that.
4304800	4305800	Nah, you're right.
4305800	4306800	All right.
4306800	4309560	Well, kids, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks
4309560	4310560	so much for calling.
4310560	4311560	Thanks for taking our call.
4311560	4312560	You're welcome.
4312560	4313560	Have a good one, you guys.
4313560	4316560	Have fun with your show.
4316560	4317560	All right.
4317560	4322920	Raven and DeBucket from Tekken Games, which I think is beating us on Op 11 still.
4322920	4323920	You go, boys.
4323920	4324920	All right.
4324920	4325920	Any other last minute stories?
4325920	4326920	We're talking about the beer and maim machine.
4326920	4327920	Yes.
4327920	4328920	Skypline is now closed, kids.
4328920	4330360	Sorry if those didn't get through.
4330360	4337080	The Gamerator, it's $2,000, but it's a custom-built maim cabinet, and it comes preloaded, of course,
4337080	4338080	with 180 games.
4338080	4344960	Plus, it's got an internal AV hookups, lets you throw your PC or console in there as well.
4344960	4348160	And then, of course, it doubles as a keg.
4348160	4352960	It's got tap and everything, so that's awesome.
4352960	4356000	Beer and maim together.
4356000	4361840	Another interesting thing, I guess, there is a sequel to Dig Dug 2 coming.
4361840	4363640	I guess it's called Dig Dug Islands.
4363640	4371920	It's actually being, Namco Bandai has partnered with Verx to produce it as an online PC game.
4371920	4376160	So if you're interested in more Dig Dug, there you go.
4376160	4377160	Some last bits.
4377160	4380120	There already was like a Dig Dug one and a half on DS.
4380120	4381440	I had it.
4381440	4383320	Yeah, Dig Dug DS.
4383320	4384840	I have it.
4384840	4392400	Anyways, Nexon, of course, that South Korean company doing a lot of MMOs and stuff, they're
4392400	4398000	developing a couple games for, well, one for the Xbox 360 and one for the DS.
4398000	4401540	MapleStory is coming to the DS, so that's the one that's being worked on right now.
4401540	4408040	The other one is a MMO called Mabinogi, and that's coming to the 360.
4408040	4415400	So I guess Mabinogi is a cel-shaded MMO that looks interesting.
4415400	4418560	And then MapleStory, you know, I think a lot of people are familiar with MapleStory, so
4418560	4422520	for the DS that would be pretty cool.
4422520	4427800	And then I guess Live is doing something for their 5th anniversary starting November 15th.
4427800	4429400	Lots of parties online.
4429400	4430400	Uno for everybody.
4430400	4432880	Well, you know, that's interesting because that's starting on Wednesday.
4432880	4438320	I wonder if they got any really kick-ass Xbox Live arcade games for that day.
4438320	4440240	They haven't said what's coming out this week, have they?
4440240	4441240	No, not yet.
4441240	4442700	Maybe they're sitting on something good.
4442700	4445680	What are some really like highly anticipated games we haven't got yet?
4445680	4446680	Rez?
4446680	4447680	Rez would be fucking awesome.
4447680	4448680	Yeah, that's true.
4448680	4449680	It could be that.
4449680	4450680	Hell no.
4450680	4453680	Oh, the hella famous shooter, Treasure.
4453680	4454680	Omega 5?
4454680	4455680	Omega 5?
4455680	4456680	No, the one that's...
4456680	4457680	Igaruga?
4457680	4458680	Radiant Silver Gun.
4458680	4459680	Igaruga is the one that...
4459680	4460680	Igaruga.
4460680	4461680	Yeah.
4461680	4464040	But Omega 5, they've been pimping that out for a while now.
4464040	4465480	That'd be kind of cool.
4465480	4467200	Well, the party starts on Microsoft this week.
4467200	4468520	I thought Screw Jumper was coming out.
4468520	4470160	Did that already come out, Screw Jumper?
4470160	4473600	Oh, I think they have confirmed that is this week's title, Screw Jumper, but there could
4473600	4474600	be a second one that's really cool.
4474600	4475600	Yeah, there could be a second one.
4475600	4476600	Screw Jumper looks stupid.
4476600	4477600	It might be okay.
4477600	4478600	It might be okay.
4478600	4479600	All right.
4479600	4483080	Well, if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then we're going to go around and wrap up
4483080	4486520	this show by going around and getting everybody's final thought.
4486520	4488960	DarkSakura, thank you as always for blessing us with your presence.
4488960	4489960	What's your final thought?
4489960	4494080	My final thought is I can't find where I can save this wallpaper to so that I can make
4494080	4496320	it fit my desktop.
4496320	4499840	And I'll thank myself for blessing the show with my presence, and my final thought is
4499840	4504400	I want enchiladas really bad, because looking at this Aldoberto's mug makes me crave horchata's.
4504400	4508880	Loki, thank you as always for being here, and what's your final thought?
4508880	4511520	Final thought is there's plenty of games for me to play this week.
4511520	4512520	All right.
4512520	4513520	Sounds good.
4513520	4514520	Lots of stuff to play.
4514520	4517280	If only there were like 30 hours in the day as opposed to 24.
4517280	4521040	I'm glad I've made special arrangements for my consoles early on.
4521040	4524920	All right, folks, that's... Oh, what?
4524920	4527920	My PC is still down, so did I pump up the volume for the immediate future?
4527920	4528920	Yeah.
4528920	4533480	The only weekly shows we have going regularly right now are Thursday night, DMN is still
4533480	4538800	doing the Insanest Hour, and Saturday I believe Travis Donovan is back up and running after
4538800	4540120	a little bit of a summer hiatus.
4540120	4541860	I know he had a show this week.
4541860	4546500	So hopefully by the new year we'll be up and running with lots of shows.
4546500	4551520	We are in talks to do some stuff, so we'll get back to you with that.
4551520	4557200	And just also the FYI, next week, week after I will not be here.
4557200	4558200	Cry.
4558200	4559460	And the week after that.
4559460	4560920	You may get the... Well, one of those weeks-
4560920	4561920	I'll be in Alabama.
4561920	4562920	We're not going to be here at all.
4562920	4563920	Yeah.
4563920	4564920	We're going to take a break from the show.
4564920	4567520	I believe the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I think we agreed we can just not have a show
4567520	4568520	that week.
4568520	4570840	Although that's going to be a big gaming week with Rock Band and everything.
4570840	4572560	I think we'll live if we take a week off.
4572560	4574720	Well, hopefully we'll talk about that earlier.
4574720	4575720	We'll see.
4575720	4576720	I'm crossing my fingers.
4576720	4579400	But you can get the Loki and Rob show the week after.
4579400	4582360	We'll hold down the fort, even though Dark Soccer will be on a plane back from Alabama.
4582360	4584880	I'll be fine to go that Sunday anyways.
4584880	4585880	No, we'll see.
4585880	4586880	Maybe we'll do.
4586880	4587880	We haven't decided yet.
4587880	4588880	I don't know.
4588880	4589880	We could use a break though.
4589880	4593480	I take that time during Thanksgiving to travel somewhere, so I kind of want to go back to
4593480	4594480	Magic Mountain.
4594480	4595480	We'll see.
4595480	4596480	I've got to find somebody to go with me though.
4596480	4598280	Hopefully it hasn't burned down yet.
4598280	4599280	Hope not.
4599280	4600280	Hope not.
4600280	4601280	All right.
4601280	4602280	Well, that's it.
4602280	4605120	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting and
4605120	4606120	independent radio.
4606120	4607120	We've said that a lot tonight.
4607120	4611360	Again, if you guys like what you hear, or even if you don't like what you hear, please
4611360	4614660	still help us out by telling two people you know about the program.
4614660	4618240	If you can't think of anybody to tell, then spread the word on the internet.
4618240	4621600	You can do that through iTunes by leaving us a positive reviewer or one of those many,
4621600	4626360	many sites like Podcast Alley, Yahoo Podcasts, Digg, whatever the hell.
4626360	4627720	Just help us spread the word.
4627720	4628720	We really appreciate it.
4628720	4629920	You guys are awesome.
4629920	4633940	Until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.
4633940	4634940	That is Loki.
4634940	4635940	She is Dark Sakura.
4635940	4639160	And together, we are not Captain Planet.
4639160	4643620	No, we are not Captain Planet, but we are Orange Lounge Radio.
4643620	4663780	So take care, and we'll see you next week.
4673620	4674620	Bye.
