19815	21536	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

46002	46342	And, of course...

86830	87811	Other people will rate them.
87851	95153	Then they have themed contests like the one going on right now is design a me that looks like Mario without his hat.
95868	96488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
120006	123528	is when the message came on the Wii that the channel was up.
123588	130151	So Loki and I briefly looked for, like, five minutes of the new channel during the break, and some pretty interesting Miis in there.
130171	133113	I liked there was, like, a Geordi LaForge Mii that was in there.
133433	137255	Somebody had created a little miniature picture of, like, a penguin on somebody's face.
137815	138816	Like, I thought that was really good.
138976	142438	They have some pretty cool, you know, Mii's on there.
142758	145319	I don't know if I could post some of the ones I've made, though.
145579	146580	Yeah, you might get rejected.
146600	147960	What happens if you send penis head in?
147980	148821	That might get rejected.
149514	152516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
179332	179613	I don't know.
180133	183660	But anyway, the Check Me Out channel is available right now.
184844	188166	And by the time most of you guys hear this, it will have been out for actually quite some time.
189107	192108	Something moving on, speaking about the Wii.
193009	200994	The Wii has been rumored earlier this week, based on a comment from Reggie Fils-Aim√©, to have 200 virtual console games by the year's end.
201374	211300	And people were kind of freaking out, like, wait a minute, in order for the Wii to have that many games by the year's end, they're going to have to really step up their production, putting out like four and a half games a week, four to five games a week.
211480	212621	4 and a half games.
234881	236261	Lots and lots of stuff to check out.
236281	236962	The old school stuff.
237262	241263	However, I would like to point out we are, what, 160 games in so far?
241643	243744	And still no Guardian Legend.
244044	244824	This makes me a sad panda.
244844	245785	That is sad.
245805	246465	It is a crime.
246865	247145	Awful.
247165	247785	That has been committed.
248786	252307	So I don't know what rights you have to get, but you better get those really quick.
252967	257048	So that's all I have to say about the Virtual Console.
257509	260550	Well, for our friends in the UK, Super Mario Bros.
260870	262530	3 is heading to Virtual Console.
263151	264371	Actually, we are getting it on Monday.
265409	266530	We got this Monday.
266650	269752	Yeah, we already got this Monday.
270533	273034	And it's going to be 500 Wii Points.
273635	277557	Also coming out is Blue's Journey for the Neo Geo, and that will be 900.
279198	282020	And also Power Golf for TurboGrafx-16 for 600 points.
286530	288151	Well, I'm glad to see that Super Mario Bros.
288371	290613	3 is making the rounds worldwide, because it is a great game.
290974	294376	It is one of the all-time great NES classics, so everybody gets to enjoy it now.
294637	294977	Hooray!
295137	296338	Yay!
296938	298219	Anyways.
298580	303864	So, apparently some Best Buys have been breaking street on Super Mario Galaxy and selling it early.
304024	304945	Shame on them.
305785	313512	And apparently a few people have been buying according to the Games Facts forum thread, I guess.
314232	316074	They have pictures online including stuff
317130	321613	But hey, you only have to wait a couple more days to play it, so... Hurry.
322814	325717	Now, if they had Super Smash Bros., that'd be... That'd be a feat.
328098	331181	I somehow don't think they can get that right now.
331661	334403	ACHP is in our chatroom and is bragging, I got a copy!
335624	342169	So apparently, somehow... Some folks were able to get one from Best Buy, so good job to those folks.
342810	344131	So... Um...
345592	356000	Moving on, speaking of Super Mario Galaxy, right now, right this very minute, there is an event going on at the Nintendo World Store in New York City.
356040	358502	It is the Mario Galaxy Launch Party.
359803	360904	It's going on right now.
360984	365388	I think it started at 8 p.m.
365428	370032	is when it started, but it's only been going until 10 p.m., so I guess it...
370831	371792	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
397125	399047	Hey, Zaku, how are you doing?
422775	432500	I'm just here in the rock right here, just seeing Mario Galaxy on screens, and people just going after t-shirts, and just freaking my ass off.
432520	434401	So, yeah, that's pretty much it.
434741	436782	What the hell's going on?
436922	438983	What the hell have they been doing there tonight, Zaku?
439003	440584	They've had a Velcro wall?
443105	443825	Large party.
444185	446607	They have a live DJ right now.
447327	448507	They're giving out free shit.
449328	451409	There's people waiting in line for the launch.
452111	459035	and I know one of them is the one that actually got the first Wii in this country last year before the rest of, you know, Times Square.
459856	460616	That same guy.
461076	461416	Wow.
461457	463378	That same guy with the puzzle on his right hand.
464338	467340	There's some hard... He's up on the line like one of the first two.
468300	470322	There's some hardcore people out there right now.
470742	472483	Yeah, I can't hear them but it's fantastic.
473483	473764	What?
474284	476945	I was just gonna say it sounds like there's some hardcore people there.
476965	477986	Like a few thousand people.
478006	479167	Um, but there's like
481667	484610	Tell us more about the special events that are going on.
484650	487452	Have you actually been able to get your hands on the game yet?
487472	488193	Yes, I played it.
488213	488553	They had these...
501992	510536	And like three guys with monitors basically sticking out from like a rod or something that they're carrying on their back with the game.
510596	513878	Kind of like how they did last year with the Segway.
513918	517300	You know, the Wii hooked up to the Segway, now they're basically walking.
518160	521962	They're carrying all that gear, walking the game, you know, bringing the game to you by foot.
522731	529982	Wow, our chat room is just pretty excited to be hearing the actual live report from the show going on right now.
530563	535691	In fact, Frisbee in our chat room says, this is the first time I've heard Zaku call in and not sound sleepy.
536191	538335	So you definitely are excited to be there, right?
539623	541604	Oh, come on.
541724	543606	I had to bust my ass in the cold.
543646	544206	What do you think?
545347	551631	I'm pretty much just going to get some coffee and take a leak just to get this call through.
552031	553172	But yeah, so far it's been good.
553212	560396	I mean, the game pretty much plays like Mario 64, only with motion control and slightly better graphics.
560636	562437	Awesome.
562477	566520	Well, can you give a shout-out to the entire crowd that Orange Lounge Radio says hello?
570322	572523	I'm on the outside of the crowd, it's pretty thick right there.
573284	575805	It's going to be hard to get inside there.
575925	579487	Can you give a big shout out to everybody around you that Orange Hodge Radio says hello?
582969	587592	Oh man, they'll be just looking at random strangers just saying some crazy stuff.
587992	591134	If I knew about this earlier, then I would have just done my whole body with OLR promotion stuff.
591174	593535	I just would have put the West Side Dames.
604179	607500	It's all good.
608080	611941	Zaku, thanks so much for the report and have fun at the event.
612041	613402	And don't go too crazy, okay?
617783	618523	Take care, buddy.
618543	621044	Have a good one.
621284	621584	Later.
621865	622405	Poor guy.
622705	628967	That's one of our infamous callers, the Legend of Zaku, calling us live from the Mario launch event at the Nintendo...
629502	631103	World Headquarters in New York City.
631563	633765	Isn't that fun when we can do live reports like that?
634365	636767	More stuff needs to happen on Sunday nights when we can do that.
637808	638328	Good times.
638828	642131	You can definitely hear in the background, just like there's tons of people there.
642191	642711	It's amazing.
643692	645813	Alright, well let's move on then with the news.
645853	647735	Thank you, Zaku, again for that special report.
650336	656040	Well, in other news, and I think that this is pretty cool because there are a lot of fans of this game.
657742	658142	For a
659201	662702	Anyone with a PSP, Disgaea is heading out to PSP.
663442	665863	It will be called Afternoon of Darkness.
666664	667944	Oh, so it's like a new game in the series.
668604	669325	Sounds like.
670985	681989	They're putting in a few specific things for the PSP, like a multiplayer mode where you can go against your friends worldwide or share items from your shop.
683429	685130	It has an exclusive story line.
686361	690583	and you're trying to become the beauty queen ultimate overlord.
693325	697787	It's not your goal in real life, DarkSakura, to become the beauty queen overlord?
698187	700048	No, my goal is just to be the overlord.
701129	701469	I see.
702750	702850	Yep.
703790	707132	I know a lot of people really love Disgaea for its quirky sense of humor, and I played it once.
707192	707552	It's fun.
708132	711995	I need to sit down and spend more time with it if I could ever tear myself away from those damn MMOs.
712355	716317	Well, if you're in the U.S., you're in luck because it came out a couple weeks ago.
716957	717317	Sweet!
718298	720699	Definitely worth picking up if you like Disgaea.
721039	724161	So it's very typical that the Brits are getting it a couple weeks behind.
724241	725001	Sorry, guys.
725822	726842	Hey, we still love you.
727142	731965	PSP is a region free, so if you really, really, really, really, really need your Disgaea right away, then there you go.
733719	745388	Anyways, not a big surprise, but Sony has released a custom theme maker for the PlayStation 3, much like they did with the PSP after they had theme support for that.
745468	751513	Of course, with the new firmware 2.0 allowing themes, you can now create your own.
752532	761834	So yes, as soon as I get around to it, I will create new themes for the PSP website, and I'll also create a theme for the PlayStation 3 as well.
761854	762594	It's about time.
763074	763474	Sheesh.
763494	764134	Yeah, whatever.
764415	765555	I'm too busy playing stuff.
765575	776117	I just renewed the domain not that long ago, and I seriously considered just letting it expire, but then I remember that there were some people that were emailing us saying, I listen to you on the PSP, and so I figured, alright, for them we'll keep the site up.
777481	778782	It was a really well done website.
778802	781183	You don't see many PSP custom done websites.
781383	785206	I did not renew the domain for OLRE since I never made a site for that.
785346	785766	Damn you.
786346	786787	Whatever.
787327	787887	Who cares?
788288	788808	We forgive you.
789195	804260	Well, also on the PlayStation 3, apparently, if you had your firmware before version 2.0, you usually only used to be able to see videos if it was supported in PlayStation 3's format.
804560	815844	Well, now after the 2.0 patch, apparently, the PlayStation 3 will now show you thumbnails, running times, and file names for other non-supported formats, such as Xvid and DivX.
816344	818526	Now, you can't play them, you can just see them.
818866	828214	But certainly people are taking that one step further and saying, well, this is a sign that you're actually going to have support for DivX and Xvid in the near future on the PlayStation 3, which would certainly be a welcome addition.
828995	829275	Yeah.
830036	832638	But for right now, you only get thumbnails and you get to know they're there.
833018	836261	It's just that it will say, you can't watch me, na-na-na-na-na-na.
837222	838002	So, there you have it.
838283	839203	Oh, poor baby.
840264	844528	Well, so, it's about, you know, we've
845326	855989	They have a preliminary settlement for the class action suit against Take-Two Interactive.
857410	858290	For the hot coffee.
858550	860090	Oh my god, this is years old.
860531	860831	Yeah.
862211	870734	So, basically, the terms of the settlement, the ones who can benefit from that is if they bought a copy of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas before July 20th, 2005.
873186	881052	B, were offended by the game's content that used the hot coffee modification.
882253	886216	That means they would have had... I was offended that I had to unlock it.
888418	893582	No, they said they were upset by the ability to modify and alter the game.
895323	901208	Well, I was upset that you had to have an ability to do it and it wasn't just there, so can I have money?
902088	902529	And that...
904455	904735	Wow.
905116	905196	So...
931357	934460	There's still more money than GameStop will give you for it, so hey.
934780	935320	Pretty much.
937762	949071	Take-Two is committed to spend $1.025 million on the settlement benefits, and their out-of-pocket cost total is $2.75 million.
952532	955413	and paying the court costs.
955613	959215	Now, Picaruno in our chatroom says, you can get free money if I say I'm offended by something?
959375	960555	You have to have your proof of purchase.
960575	961575	I have to have the proof of purchase.
961675	963416	Who the hell has a proof of purchase that late?
963776	964116	I know.
964156	965337	Well, that's how they get around it.
966097	970118	But I'm going to save it for Grand Theft Auto 4 because I'm going to be highly offended by that someday.
970418	971779	I want to see how many people actually have it.
971799	974020	Highly offended that I didn't get my $35 sooner.
974520	980242	There's a statement, by the way, from Ben Fetter, who's the CEO of Take-Two.
982521	993766	If the case had continued, we believe the court would have agreed that Take-Two was not liable for consumers acting independently to modify their games with third-party hardware and software to access normally inaccessible content.
994286	1002150	Nonetheless, we believe it is in the best interest of the company to avoid protracted and costly litigation to prove our case and to finally put this matter behind us.
1003491	1005952	Gerardimo says, I'm offended by your offense.
1006718	1011541	Actdeft, our listener from Mexico who's listening, says, I'm suing the guys that made the Spanish training game.
1011881	1013122	I'm offended and I need money.
1013842	1014843	Spanish for everyone.
1016404	1016664	Awesome.
1018025	1018305	Wow.
1019486	1020547	So, I don't know.
1021407	1026730	I would like to see if they're going to release figures on exactly how many people actually went and got money over this.
1027151	1032114	I'd be kind of curious to see how many people actually had the proof of purchases and actually went through the song and dance to do this.
1032514	1033975	I think that would be kind of an interesting figure.
1034335	1035716	I bet it's less than a couple thousand.
1036678	1037559	If that, honestly.
1037659	1039440	I mean, how many people are going to think to do this?
1040381	1042322	Most parents were pissed off and they moved on, right?
1043142	1049166	Well, you know, there's going to be letters that go out to anyone involved that put their name in with the lawsuit.
1049507	1050127	I guess that's true.
1051448	1057312	Anyways, so there's some interesting drama going on on the website, The Consumerist.
1057972	1066458	Apparently, a PS3 owner had a problem with their PS3 not working, so they sent it in to be repaired.
1067408	1073473	and, um, I guess, according to them, it was too dusty to be fixed.
1074113	1079197	And they considered that it would, because of the dust, it was not covered under the warranty.
1080117	1086121	Um... Uh-oh, my Wii's gonna be under, at a warranty as well then, with a thick layer of dust on that thing.
1086201	1087682	Well, they... Mario Galaxy's not out yet.
1087702	1090685	They said that it was an act of God or customer abuse.
1090925	1090985	No.
1092836	1093377	That would be under.
1093397	1096358	But it was funny, though, because there was a follow-up to this as well.
1097038	1101000	God has smited my PlayStation 3 with a thick layer of dust.
1101460	1102661	The horror, the horror.
1103081	1110525	But there was also a follow-up to that I remember reading that that whole statement, of course, is not really true.
1111385	1112426	Yes, Sony does.
1114046	1116327	Dust does not void your warranty as well.
1116928	1119829	But that was in the later follow-up, I guess.
1120308	1148656	but this one lady that was adamant she said that she was like the head of the customer service department or something like that and anybody that they called you know oh and then the other thing too is the guy said well then hell you know take a picture of this dust and let me you know see what exactly you're talking about if it's so you know detrimental and they said oh no we can't take any pictures of that because all the pictures would be owned by Sony and then you can't you know see them without a subpoena or something like that you have to pay $150 to repair it out of warranty or something like that ugh
1149803	1152425	Our chatroom is lighting up with conversation here.
1152565	1154906	Odd1 says, it was an act of shitty games.
1155867	1158469	Frisbee says, God made dirt and dirt don't hurt.
1161610	1165173	Basically, I was just going to read some sections of this here.
1165993	1170696	I kept my 60GB PS3 in an entertainment center since its purchase.
1171705	1176211	It is known within the PS3 community that the thing is a huge dust magnet.
1176651	1177672	I took good care of it.
1177732	1180496	I have 10 Blu-ray discs that did not come free with my PS3.
1180776	1181858	5 games, 5 controllers.
1182118	1183480	Why the fuck do you have 5 controllers?
1185169	1185909	What the hell are you playing?
1185929	1186790	Maybe Specialty Controller?
1187470	1189410	NBA Live, I'm guessing, because that game supports up to 7.
1190591	1193411	Or not NBA Live, NBA 08 or whatever, or 07.
1193491	1196112	Yeah, we get it.
1196152	1202813	Two 42-inch LCD TVs, one 50-inch Bravia LCD rear-production TV air, something like that.
1203294	1205034	A VAIO desktop, VAIO laptop, blah, blah, blah.
1205416	1210079	Anyways, one day I turn it on, I put a disc in it, and it doesn't show up, and it won't eject.
1210159	1212920	Finally, I get it to eject, and I try Blu-ray, and nothing, the CD's nothing.
1213221	1220805	So I called customer support, who originally told me they can't do anything because I don't have the original sales receipt.
1220865	1221325	It was a gift.
1221826	1228390	I stayed on the phone for hours explaining to them that I don't have the receipt because it was a gift.
1231158	1232639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1257805	1261266	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, was the owner Pigpen from Peanuts?
1262687	1270410	And Azura May says, I hope I pronounced that right, says, PlayStation 3 weakness is dust, which makes me think of, like, the end of Signs.
1271070	1273872	Like, you know, it was water that was their weak point the whole time.
1273952	1274772	Now it's, like, dust.
1275132	1278493	Anyway, so, like, he goes back and forth, finally talking.
1278874	1285916	The supervisor, who apparently was a bitch, named Daria Wu, extension 55682,
1288924	1297826	basically told them that the PSP or picture of the PSP was property of Sony Computer Entertainment of America and that they would have to subpoena the pictures in order to see them.
1298926	1300066	And blah blah blah.
1300526	1303267	And then of course at the very end he says I don't get it.
1303327	1305867	Sony is including folding at home with their consoles.
1305907	1309708	The auto start feature makes it so it's running almost all the time.
1309748	1311288	Of course it's going to be filled with dust.
1311808	1314489	Few reps said the reason they couldn't replace it is because it looked like at
1316665	1319587	It had been two years worth of dust rather than eight months.
1319967	1326670	The console hasn't even been out for years, so obviously that's less than a year's worth of dust.
1328871	1334434	And of course, he's all pissed off about it and wasn't going to stay quiet, and that's why everybody ran it.
1335434	1344097	And then apparently, like I said, the follow-up, another consumer rep reported, I'm calling pretty much to clarify the PS3's warranty.
1344518	1350700	If there's any clause in the warranty that makes it so the PS3 is too dusty, that the warranty is void.
1351160	1352040	And the rep said, no.
1352761	1352981	No.
1353901	1354581	And no.
1354882	1360724	The only way that it voided is if it were neglected, abused, dropped, or anything like that.
1360784	1363085	Modification, like if you opened it up...
1365007	1370410	If you don't have the sales receipt, Power Failures, Mother Nature actually avoids the warranty.
1372571	1375312	Christ, there's a Bible written on this whole thing, isn't there?
1375792	1376512	Let me put it this way.
1376552	1377593	Why didn't they just fix it?
1377653	1381354	I mean, seriously, they're... I don't know.
1381615	1384016	The fucking system obviously hadn't been opened up.
1384416	1384876	So what?
1384916	1385596	It's dusty.
1385836	1388198	You're doing a horrible job of making a dust magnet.
1391039	1391359	All right.
1391963	1395325	Well, anyhow, I'm sure we're getting lots of colorful comments on that one.
1396005	1400628	If you have something to contribute, if your PlayStation 3 has died due to dust, we'd love to hear from you.
1400648	1401088	You know what?
1401288	1401488	What?
1401808	1403870	I think this is a job for Dust Cap 2.
1404670	1407592	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to send us an email.
1407672	1411654	And Jamie will be opening up the mailbag very soon, but we have one more story for you guys before we get to that point.
1412274	1414336	and that would be about Warner Brothers.
1415036	1421441	Warner Brothers has decided to purchase Traveler's Tales and the parent group TT Games.
1421802	1426245	You might know Traveler's Tales from the Lego franchise as well.
1426966	1428727	So Warner Brothers just wants to own that shit.
1429347	1429948	So there you have it.
1431129	1437193	By the way, they'll be putting out Lego Batman very soon, which looks kind of awesome because I love old school Batman.
1438695	1439255	So there you have it.
1440325	1449531	Alright, well like I said, every week you guys send us email to mailbag at orangelongeradio.com And the one and only DarkSakura will open up the mailbag, dive on in, and read her favorite emails.
1450091	1451792	And maybe some of the ones she didn't like either.
1451852	1452913	Hopefully this is a good week.
1453173	1454814	I don't know, DarkSakura, was it a good email week?
1455354	1457075	On a scale of 1 to 10?
1457436	1458336	Maybe a 6, a 7?
1459697	1463319	R. It was an R. Okay, well anyway, I don't know how that works.
1463419	1465601	But here goes DarkSakura with this week's mail.
1465661	1467222	Mailbag at orangelongeradio.com
1468817	1470838	The first email comes from Xenocore.
1471178	1471638	Hey, folks.
1472398	1475880	I recently acquired a copy of Ore no Rioni for PS1.
1476500	1477300	I love this game.
1477380	1482302	However, the emulators I have used with the game don't give me precise control on all analog sticks.
1482983	1487545	Do you know of a better method to play this game, whether emulated or mod chip?
1487585	1491666	I still have the initial launch PS2 and a 60 gigabyte PS3.
1492066	1492667	What can I do?
1492707	1494247	I love this game and can't wait to play it.
1495928	1496008	Um...
1497245	1498006	What game?
1498026	1498526	Ore no Rionii
1522262	1525103	I had never even heard of that game, I'm sorry to say.
1525243	1531005	So I know we love obscure titles, but... No, not that one.
1531085	1536667	You know, and I gotta say, the PlayStation 1, I'm not... That was kind of the period of my life where I wasn't gaming a whole lot.
1536727	1541669	I played a lot of the big games, like Final Fantasy VII and Symphony of the Night, but I missed a lot of shit during that period.
1541689	1545610	Because that was when I was in college, and I was actually doing a little bit of work here and there.
1545630	1547030	That was back in the day... Between Puzzle Fighter 2.
1547070	1551092	That was back in the day when I was purchasing HK copies of...
1552455	1555837	Games, importing Ridge Racer 4 and shit like that.
1556077	1558618	Well, even Google can't find this.
1558638	1560439	Leave it to the chat room to say something about it, though.
1560479	1566282	The Flawless Bolt X says, Funny how someone mentions a PlayStation 1 game when last episode Loki said no one plays them anymore.
1567342	1568963	Hey, there's some irony.
1571004	1571725	In the U.S.
1572085	1573946	Sorry we don't have much more for you, my friend.
1574106	1575567	Hey, we're going to be playing Vib Ribbon.
1576567	1576787	True.
1576987	1577247	Right?
1577868	1580449	Hey, but people that play PlayStation... Let me put it this way, though.
1581002	1591588	If you want to play a PlayStation 1 game right now, you're probably either playing it on a PSP, whether it be modded or not, or you're probably playing it on a PlayStation 1 that you already have.
1592349	1593369	I don't think people are out there.
1593730	1600774	Maybe there's people out there that want to play Final Fantasy 7 or something like that to try it out, but I don't think there's actually people out there that are like, you know what?
1601534	1605797	I think I'm going to buy a brand new PlayStation 1 and some PlayStation 1 games.
1606037	1607738	Most people don't really go back that far.
1609677	1611138	Sorry, we weren't much help on that one.
1611958	1613559	We're not experts on everything.
1613599	1614320	Just most things.
1615420	1617622	But congratulations for stumping the host.
1617722	1619082	Here's some free rice-a-roni.
1619302	1621284	I couldn't find anything about that game.
1622404	1624785	Anyway, we get an email from Thomas.
1624846	1626026	It says, OLR equals win.
1626046	1628788	Well, thank you, Thomas.
1629328	1630829	And we get one from Robert M.,
1632190	1633212	Freudian Slip
1643314	1645715	Jamie, how dare you insult the listeners?
1645735	1646255	You know what?
1646275	1646616	Whatever.
1647216	1649997	But I did go ahead and purchase that on iTunes Store.
1650397	1654639	I have only two complaints, which are issues with all iPods games so far.
1654719	1656720	First of all, it uses a lot of battery power while playing.
1657101	1670527	Secondly, any session between syncing the iPod with your computer with iTunes in which FaZe is played even once appears to clear out your play counts for all podcasts and songs, which isn't even an issue if you don't care about play counts, but it can be problematic for podcasts.
1670587	1672548	It's playing FaZe to a podcast.
1673328	1674550	Wow, that might be interesting.
1675150	1675551	Or not.
1675911	1678355	Otherwise, the game is a lot of fun, simple but addictive.
1678435	1680838	Most of it uses the back, select, and forward buttons.
1681956	1688618	Tap to the beat of the music following on-screen scrolling options with a great artistic style surrounding it.
1689098	1694839	A few parts use the scroll wheel to follow a line for bonus points, which build up stars needed to pass checkpoints.
1695439	1705061	It usually works equally as well with songs you add to the playlist in iTunes as it does with its built-in songs, including new songs by Freeze Pop, Bang Camaro, among others.
1705161	1705481	Sweet.
1705682	1707502	Highly recommended for fans of music games.
1709073	1711596	I bought my PS3 from Kmart and now they stopped selling Blu-ray discs?
1711616	1712917	Those damn traitors.
1712937	1718803	This is the person with the really cool signature that says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of Neverending Salads.
1734414	1735135	and Breadsticks.
1735175	1735835	Don't forget Breadsticks.
1735855	1737157	I don't want any more salad.
1737497	1739719	It's gonna be more salad for you.
1742442	1742962	Oh, never mind.
1743082	1744303	I was gonna say something but I lost.
1744323	1745104	My train derailed.
1745725	1746345	My train of thought.
1746365	1748327	The salad destroyed your train.
1748347	1751470	Because I started thinking about the Olive Garden and the Olive Garden's awesome.
1753252	1754253	Well, we have a long one.
1755354	1756555	Hooray for long emails.
1759249	1770178	This is actually being sent to us by, well, if I just say Rick, because he didn't put a nickname in there, but it seems like he's from the UK.
1770538	1770919	That's cool.
1771959	1772340	Hi, guys.
1772700	1774161	Let me know if you get the reference.
1774702	1775783	Okay.
1775963	1779105	It started with GameSpot, and then it expanded to IGN.
1779185	1782068	Then I found this link to OLR on a random podcast site.
1782468	1786531	Now my crack-like habit of listening to gaming podcasts creeps into my working day.
1787591	1788031	I own a Wii.
1810163	1813884	I know it may not seem as a hardcore system, but I love it.
1814464	1817565	I have owned every incarnation of Nintendo's system and enjoyed them all.
1817605	1818866	Yes, even the N64.
1819226	1820907	Dark was cool, apart from the last level.
1821767	1830250	And I have never had a hardware failure with any of them, apart from when I made smoke come out of the back of my Super NES after playing Desert Strike for 24 hours solid.
1830430	1830870	Wow.
1831330	1832030	Hardcore.
1832931	1835731	I don't know if I'd say hardcore, more so fanboy.
1836892	1837272	It's all right.
1837915	1838355	It's not a crime.
1863439	1867981	After frantically searching the internet, I found that the problem was with the video card on the Wii overheating.
1868641	1872643	I rang the nice people at Nintendo and sent it away and after two weeks they returned it back to me all fixed.
1872683	1874444	Now I am happy to say it all looks fab.
1875064	1876145	Is this a common fault?
1876645	1879306	I have never heard any of this on any podcast before.
1879446	1882347	The 360 has its own podcast named after its notorious issues.
1883328	1884508	Anyway, keep up the good work.
1884608	1888370	I would love to hear my email on your show as I am a big fan and you always seem to have fun.
1888857	1890318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1918922	1919783	Why is it playing that noise?
1919803	1923846	Because I forgot to hit stop earlier and it was playing the Portal song from earlier.
1923866	1927409	But anyway, I did find... Sorry, the show.
1927429	1927929	Oh, IGN.
1927949	1928930	Tonight's show was a lie.
1929551	1934515	No, but what it was is that apparently it's... Yeah, we found some information on the game on IGN.
1934855	1940900	Apparently it was a cooking simulator and it was the first DualShock enhanced cooking simulator on the market.
1940940	1942001	No, it wasn't on the Dreamcast.
1942041	1943522	It just came out the same day as the Dreamcast.
1943542	1944683	But they did have a demo in the US.
1945624	1945964	Whatever.
1946064	1947005	On the PlayStation Underground.
1947557	1950121	I've been over Cooking Mama for about a month now, you know.
1950141	1950902	I know, I have to get it.
1961880	1963340	Anyway, I wanted to say to our... I want to make a cake.
1963700	1968621	I wanted to say to our hardcore fan overseas that you are not the first person to have an exploding Wii.
1968981	1972122	That particular issue, I think, is the first time I've heard of that.
1972182	1976082	Certainly, nobody else I've ever heard compares it to hemorrhoid, whatever.
1976222	1976943	That was kind of weird.
1977523	1981443	But, you know, every system is going to have some that break.
1981703	1984004	You know, there's just some faulty stuff on the assembly line.
1984344	1986984	Anything that comes off an assembly line is going to have a fault once in a while.
1987224	1990885	That game, Counter Force, kind of looked like a bursting hemorrhoid, but, you know, that's just...
1991485	1993706	That game, I guess.
1994827	1999349	But the problem was, at least with the Xbox 360, that Red Rings of Death was very prevalent.
1999509	2004892	A lot of people had that issue, and that's why it's become almost like a pop culture gag within the gaming scene.
2004932	2009015	I didn't know there was a podcast called Red Rings of Death, but I'm somehow not surprised.
2009075	2013977	I mean, that's why it's become such a phenomenon and why Microsoft had to specifically extend the warranty.
2014477	2015438	To Nintendo's credit...
2016581	2017101	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2045129	2045669	So there's more.
2046210	2046450	More.
2046470	2047611	Can I finish the email?
2047771	2048171	More.
2048571	2048871	Thank you.
2049872	2050832	Spelled M-O-A-R.
2052153	2052493	P.S.
2052974	2055095	Where the fuck is my strategy game for the Wii?
2055695	2057857	Surely it's perfect for Command & Conquer.
2058417	2060798	I would even settle for Red Alert Graphics.
2060918	2062059	Is that asking too much?
2062219	2062519	Yes.
2063520	2065121	Okay then, Tiberium Wars?
2066802	2067042	Okay.
2067062	2067142	Okay.
2068164	2069065	are there any strategy games?
2070025	2092027	Battalion Wars 2 maybe and then Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn but Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn unfortunately is apparently very much like the last game that came out in the GameCube almost exactly the same but we like Fire Emblem I just hate playing strategy games myself oh and a question for me
2093123	2094504	Did you ever play Cannon Fodder?
2094644	2097246	It was an awesome game, also should be remade for the Wii.
2097666	2099847	War has never been so much fun, and so on.
2100908	2102729	I know of it, I actually have not played it.
2103790	2104550	That sounds familiar.
2104910	2105831	I've never played it either.
2106692	2109553	Yet another game stumping the panel here at Orange Library.
2109573	2110834	No, I think I did play it.
2111415	2114036	We've talked about Cannon Fodder on the show before, I thought.
2116978	2119840	Back in a while, but I do believe that we have.
2120871	2124912	Escapist says in our chatroom, Cannon Fodder was good, General Chaos was better.
2125252	2130534	See, when in doubt, when we're stumped, we always have the chatroom and plenty of people there to rely on, on their gaming knowledge as well.
2130634	2132815	There's one more last bit to this email.
2133315	2135076	Wow, this goes on forever.
2135516	2135876	Bye!
2137416	2138697	It's capitalized, I had to say it that way.
2138717	2139397	Alright.
2139717	2139897	Goodbye.
2139917	2141898	Last, last email.
2141998	2142698	Dun dun dun.
2143846	2159050	Dearest OLR, with Journey of Dreams and a new Samba de Amigo coming to Wii and Rez coming to Xbox Live Arcade, which I think was Sega?
2159570	2164652	It seems Sega is giving gamers a chance to play some of their better games that were probably missed by most people.
2166332	2170093	Some of those that should have remained missed, yes.
2170672	2176356	If this is the case, I was wondering which Shaggy games you would like to see remade slash sequelized slash playable again.
2176836	2179178	Personally, I would love to see Space Channel 5 on Wii.
2179939	2185503	And it's one of the few games I would like to play by shaking the Wii mode around, but only if Space Michael still has a part in it.
2185543	2186904	You took my answer, jerk.
2187804	2189686	You took my answer, Gerardimo, you jerk.
2190066	2192448	That's exactly what I would have said is Space Channel 5.
2192508	2193288	Now what am I going to say?
2193368	2193769	Space Channel 5 2.
2195034	2196374	Thanks for watching!
2212708	2215671	They even do the freaking Thriller Dance, and I think that's fantastic.
2215891	2219755	How about another Crazy Taxi game, but like a good one, not a cheap knockoff.
2219775	2222759	Like, you know, Crazy Taxi kind of jumped the shark because there was like sequel after sequel.
2223039	2228865	How about like a remade, really good Crazy Taxi that has more than just the offspring as the music?
2229165	2229986	They had Bad Religion.
2230787	2231188	Oh, sorry.
2231508	2232469	Jet Set Radio?
2232829	2233050	Yeah.
2233330	2233410	Ah.
2234513	2239398	That's another thing that we need is definitely another Jet Set Radio because I freaking love that game.
2240398	2241199	Odd One agrees with that.
2241239	2244582	Jet Set Radio, doing the graffiti with the Wiimote would be awesome.
2244602	2247324	Because you'd have to do it in that pattern, right?
2248105	2251227	GS68 says Space Harrier and fuck Planet Harrier.
2251247	2252048	Planet Harrier.
2252408	2252789	Okay.
2253770	2258353	I love Space Harrier, but the thing is that I could not imagine Space Harrier updated.
2259034	2261016	The best version...
2262336	2264478	I got one for you that's perfect for Xbox Live.
2264498	2264918	Fantasy Zone.
2264938	2265379	Oh, hell yeah!
2289392	2290913	They fully need to put out fantasies on it.
2290973	2295698	Except I think that it would be kind of... You would have to do it, though, classic controller only, I think.
2297119	2301663	Or how about... You know what game we haven't seen an incarnation of in a long time is Alex Kidd.
2302363	2303845	Bring me some Alex Kidd.
2303865	2310050	You know what's actually going to be coming out here pretty soon, in January, I think, is that Sega Bass Fishing.
2311171	2312112	You know what that is...
2312905	2316227	Well, let's remember the one on the Dreamcast with the fishing rod.
2316287	2317928	Oh, yeah, yeah, with the rod caliber.
2318068	2319768	Yeah, that game gave us rod caliber.
2320869	2321169	Good times.
2321189	2327332	And I know that I've mentioned this on the show a bunch of times, but you could play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod, and it was really cool.
2327592	2330133	You know, you can actually play that Soul Calibur Legends.
2330153	2333415	They have that fishing rod that comes with hooked real motion fishing.
2333515	2334035	Have you tried it?
2335076	2342099	No, I have not tried that game because, well, one, I don't want to buy hooked because it's a fishing game, and I don't.
2342834	2344615	I don't find fishing fun.
2345216	2347257	Simulating fishing I think would be even less fun.
2348978	2349438	Yeah.
2354942	2356063	Anyways, any more emails?
2357163	2360385	We actually got one from Rob with Two Bees.
2361226	2365609	It's a link to a story about a boy who hired a hitman to kill his parents for PlayStation punishment.
2366769	2367330	That's funny.
2369019	2374364	A boy, these parents told their son they couldn't play his PlayStation for poor grades and bad behavior.
2374844	2376726	And the son tried to hire a hitman.
2378507	2380949	Oh my God, what's this world coming to?
2381229	2392478	These people in Maryland, Shannon and Joey Troiano from Maryland punished their son Corey by confiscating their PlayStation and hiding it and banned him from watching TV.
2393119	2395881	So he tried to hire a hitman.
2397040	2399341	and his mom actually set him up for a sting.
2401261	2402301	God, that kid's retarded.
2402521	2405782	What in the hell is wrong with this family?
2406743	2412504	He promised that he would give him his stepfather's new pickup as payment for killing his parents.
2415265	2415925	Wow.
2416885	2419186	And somebody was actually going to kill these people over a pickup?
2419366	2419586	No.
2419726	2424027	Maybe it was a really nice pickup.
2425745	2426626	I somehow doubt that.
2426826	2427626	That's crazy talk.
2427746	2428207	Wow.
2428747	2429127	Wow.
2429348	2437474	And she's quoted as saying, I miss him being at home and I miss us joking around and kidding around but in the same breath I don't know what this kid will do because that's not my son.
2438214	2439755	That can't be my little boy sitting there.
2440075	2440416	Wow.
2441657	2445840	It said that his behavior got worse ever since his father left.
2445860	2449082	It's like Rosemary's Baby or The Omen or something crazy there.
2449843	2450223	Wow.
2451364	2453125	Any more emails to depress us?
2454741	2456962	So that he dropped out of school and stole 45 bucks.
2456982	2458743	Wow.
2458783	2459043	Anyway.
2459063	2460064	This guy sounds like a real winner.
2460864	2461105	All right.
2461125	2461665	Yeah, that's it.
2461825	2462505	That's it for emails.
2462545	2465427	If you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
2465467	2466888	Meanwhile, more news.
2467788	2468769	News.
2469169	2469509	Anyways.
2470890	2472031	So some pretty cool stuff.
2472671	2480996	According to Valve, they're adding the Orange Box games to the source software development kit.
2481096	2483137	So that means that you guys can go out there.
2483612	2485474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2507100	2533995	Valve's custom face poser tool that allows users to produce choreographed sequences in the Source Engine, a model viewer that allows artists to preview models and animations quickly, a source code that allows mod makers to create their own games based off of Half-Life 2 or Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, and all the tools required to make, build custom textures and models for Source Engine games.
2535676	2535796	So,
2536553	2538174	That's a whole lot of cool stuff.
2540976	2548882	And I've actually seen there were some custom maps out there, mods or something like that, with Portal that actually had some gravity modifiers in there as well.
2549082	2551904	Like different sections of the map had different gravity and whatnot.
2552445	2553285	So that would be kind of cool.
2557568	2558529	Wow, all right.
2559213	2560253	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2581562	2582642	No, there's ways.
2583363	2590047	If you put in a code where you can shoot portals anywhere on any surface, you can actually get it to where you can clip through the walls sometimes.
2590447	2606297	Yeah, but there's also, I think it is kind of cool that the whole credit sequence when you're going through where the pipes are, you can actually, there is a glitch where you can go into that area because it is fully rendered and in the game.
2607918	2612259	Well, there's been a healthy donation of some SimCity made by EA.
2613299	2616880	You've probably heard of the One Laptop per Child program.
2617360	2624001	This is something where they were going to actually put laptops in classrooms in other countries for children in the classroom.
2624361	2630843	Well, EA has actually donated the original version of SimCity to be pre-installed on all machines.
2632298	2632999	Pony the Money for SimCity 2000
2652922	2653483	No, I'm just kidding.
2653503	2654383	The classic is way better.
2654423	2655224	I hate SimCity 2, though.
2655264	2657106	Well, it's also the laptop's pretty old.
2657386	2658407	I mean, well, not pretty.
2658427	2659447	They're $100, hello.
2659648	2662810	The processor in it's not exactly powerful and stuff, so.
2662970	2665072	Okay, look, as long as they play Oregon Trail, what else do you need?
2665112	2666073	That's what kids need in school.
2666093	2667194	Exactly, that's what it would have been.
2667214	2668194	So then they would need a Mac.
2669676	2671897	Or just an Apple IIe with the green monitor.
2672138	2672838	Apple IIe.
2673459	2674339	Those things are the shit.
2674680	2676421	And I want all these kids to learn Logo.
2676441	2676481	Oh.
2678851	2682473	Pen down, forward 20, right 90, forward 20, right 90.
2683453	2684294	Hey, guess what?
2684414	2685774	Atari 2600 news.
2687275	2695979	The Atari 2600 has been inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at the Strong National Museum of Play.
2696920	2700001	You know what the other two things that were inducted were along with it?
2701001	2704243	Raggedy Ann, no, Raggedy Andy, sorry, and the Kite.
2707219	2709380	I like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but with toys.
2709400	2709760	That's great.
2709780	2722403	The museum's curator has said that the Atari system paved the way for today's gaming consoles and, quote, mesmerized a generation with games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Frogger.
2723604	2724184	The kite.
2725384	2728245	So that's pretty cool.
2731386	2735107	I'm trying... Yeah, apparently it's also in there with the teddy bear, roller skates, and Mr. Potato Head.
2737149	2738571	Light Bright is the greatest toy of all time.
2757577	2758499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2775049	2776910	I would never use the things that came with them.
2776970	2777811	I made my own pictures.
2777831	2778211	Me neither.
2778251	2779812	I just put, I make patterns.
2779872	2780393	Patterns are my thing.
2780613	2781333	But you know what I found?
2781934	2785116	At a yard sale like a year ago, I found Transformers light bright patterns.
2785476	2785956	That's awesome.
2785976	2786477	So I kept them.
2786937	2787417	I bought them.
2787677	2788858	I totally want a light bright.
2788878	2791420	Couldn't you imagine putting a light bright here on the shelf with a mirror on it?
2791440	2793121	Guys, listeners, find us a light bright.
2793941	2794542	We implore.
2794782	2796863	I'm going to, I swear to God I'm going to yard sales.
2796923	2797964	I'm going to eBay right now.
2798224	2798584	Please do.
2799125	2799485	Anyways.
2800389	2805793	In case you've been living under a rock, the Writers Guild of America is striking right now.
2806333	2807234	Just a surprise.
2808875	2814299	Anyways, so what that means is a lot of movie productions have halted.
2814939	2820303	And one of those movies that's kind of been put on the brakes, I guess, Wolfenstein.
2821544	2826988	And Sci-Fi Wire apparently is reporting that the script is almost done.
2828216	2855181	um but everything as far as the production date and that kind of thing won't be decided until after all of this is over and of course um you know Roger Avery fully supports the strike and yeah so darn we guess we have to wait for a Wolvenstein movie uh just a thought it's probably gonna suck so take your time
2856620	2860403	And if the movie sucks, I will go on strike from doing this program.
2860703	2874216	There was somebody, somebody commented, I want to say it was on Any Cool News or something like that, and I'm sure people have made the same kind of comments, that TV watchers and movie watchers should have their own guild and strike when there's like crappy movies.
2874376	2875297	Refuse to watch them.
2875397	2878840	Why the hell does a Light Bright have $52 shipping on it?
2879701	2880262	Christ.
2880322	2880702	Sorry.
2880782	2881683	That's a light truck.
2882429	2884430	And then the ones, I found the Light Bright for $25.
2884550	2890312	Well, I think the whole Rider Strike thing does kind of, I mean, it's unfortunate.
2890332	2898615	Well, the reason why it has $52 shipping is probably because the sale price, if it's cheap enough, they don't have to pay as much of an eBay tax, I guess, on that thing.
2899076	2901937	Or the, you know, eBay doesn't get as big of a portion.
2902557	2904898	And then that way they can just make it all up in shipping.
2905218	2905798	That's cheap.
2907119	2908039	That's working the system.
2908759	2910420	They need to have one with a buy it now on here.
2912219	2912579	All right.
2913740	2919625	And I would like to point out that Marissa in our chat room says, Light Bright has become modern with Light Bright flat screen.
2920426	2923008	Yeah, and I want an old one like the one I had from 1982.
2923188	2927852	Can you find an Etch-A-Sketch while you're at it?
2927972	2930314	Okay, I found a 1986 Light Bright refill pack.
2930535	2930795	Rad.
2931455	2933417	We might have to get that so we get plenty of orange pigs.
2933878	2937280	Anyhow, something else from the 80s that is awesome is The Last Starfighter.
2937461	2937741	Yes!
2938971	2960858	and remember how the last Starfighter had like a video game kind of in it but it was never actually a game it was supposed to be a game but it wasn't well what happened is that this guy actually put together a copy of the Starfighter game and actually put it in the cabinet Atari had made this full final version of the game but they never actually put it out but thanks to the love
2961448	2985219	and Hard Cornus for lack of a better term of this guy he can now play Starfighter in his house I mean this comes complete with like the levers and everything this isn't just in any old cabinet this isn't like an actual cabinet like the one from the movie if you want to see this for yourself Roguesynapse.com let me spell that for you guys R-O-G-U-E-S-Y-N-A-P-S-E dot com you found a virtual light bright?
2985819	2990321	one of our chatters linked it that's just not as cool I'm sorry to say I appreciate the effort but
2991738	2992178	RogueSynapse.com
3018399	3021820	Being put out by Aniplex's A1 Pictures.
3022560	3040327	They are adapting it for, it's actually going to be called Persona Trinity Soul in January 2008, which is set a decade after the game and will center around three brothers in a city where the dead have turned their skins inside out.
3041347	3041467	Ew.
3042307	3042527	Yeah.
3043088	3043968	I'll probably watch it.
3044008	3044808	That sounds really cool.
3045008	3046469	Is that kind of like the guy in PBS?
3046489	3046689	Yes.
3048223	3048783	I don't think so.
3049283	3054084	There's a lot of people that love their Persona, so this is, I'm sure, good news to a lot of the fans of Persona 3.
3055584	3056024	I think so.
3057325	3059025	Inside out, man.
3059645	3061005	Anyways.
3061605	3071107	So, speaking of eBay earlier, if you're desperate for some celebrity memorabilia, eBay, of course, is the place to find it.
3071967	3077448	And since this is vaguely game-related, Gary Coleman is selling his GameCube
3077915	3080636	Yes, times are pretty hard for old Gary.
3081296	3087078	And of course he is signing his GameCube as well as the games coming with it.
3087518	3094240	Which if I remember correctly, there was one from Robots, the movie, the game, and some other crap in there.
3094760	3096761	So let's see here.
3098901	3101962	So if you're interested in it, only $510 right now is the going price for it.
3107423	3109624	Mortal Kombat Deception, Super Smash Bros.
3109664	3117868	Melee, Mario Kart Double Dash, Sonic 2 Adventure Battle, and Sonic Gems Collection.
3119829	3120109	Nice.
3120629	3126892	And Gary Coleman has signed each one of those things, so now you can own a piece of Gary.
3127752	3128853	A little itty-bitty piece.
3129073	3130294	He's welcome to keep it.
3130474	3135116	Former gubernatorial candidate here in California.
3135936	3137618	You might remember when Gary Coleman ran for governor.
3137678	3139399	He didn't even freaking make the top ten.
3139559	3139800	I know.
3141841	3143823	Although that one porn star did.
3143883	3144644	She was in the top ten.
3144784	3146125	Mary Carey or whatever she was.
3146425	3147787	Hey, I totally supported her.
3148047	3151770	Wasn't she promising a blowjob for everyone that voted for her?
3151870	3152271	Probably.
3153151	3153791	That's my vote.
3174008	3175269	But I want an old school one, yo.
3175309	3176529	Fifteen bucks for that.
3176810	3177210	No way.
3177330	3178531	I want an old, old one.
3178551	3179711	Yeah, I want an old school one.
3179751	3181993	Like the kind that gets so hot that you can't touch it.
3182233	3182513	I know.
3182613	3183894	Yeah, but you know what you can do with that?
3184534	3186175	Light bright companion cube.
3188356	3188656	Yes.
3188957	3189557	Good time.
3189657	3191738	You know what I'm going to do as soon as I learn how to sew?
3192899	3195640	I'm going to make myself a weighted companion cube purse.
3197902	3199603	People are crazy about their weighted companion cube.
3199663	3203805	I still have not played Portal, so these jokes go over my head.
3204962	3211605	But this joke I get, and I think it's hilarious, because one of the first games I ever remember playing on the Commodore 64 was Zork.
3212486	3224351	And Zork has apparently been smooshed with Pac-Man to create this homegrown game, Pact TXT, and it's available for play at pac-txt.com.
3224972	3226552	It's Pac-Man meets Zork.
3226933	3228834	And yes, it's as stupid as it sounds.
3229594	3232435	You actually play Pac-Man, but it's in Zork format.
3232495	3233816	In other words, you go, EAT!
3234737	3237639	You have eaten another glowing dot and you type forward.
3237679	3238759	You have moved forward.
3240300	3244583	So stupid it's hilarious, but I'm sure it will get old in about five minutes.
3246444	3246984	There you have it.
3248485	3254448	Anyhow, if you would like to give us a call, our Skype line is now open for business.

3258230	3263973	I doubt we'll have anything as exciting as the Nintendo World Store call from earlier and Zaku actually sounding not high this week
3264808	3265708	But who knows?
3267309	3268489	I'm sure our folks will try.
3268569	3274872	So meanwhile, while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a delay, let's see if there's any last minute stories from here in chat.
3275552	3276312	Or here in studio.
3276752	3278173	Hey, I'm not a chat.
3278353	3278593	I'm a me.
3278613	3278933	Sorry.
3279133	3279453	My bad.
3280634	3282854	Anyways, here's an interesting one.
3282874	3283154	E.G.,
3285546	3290569	Anamura was interviewed in the last issue of Official Nintendo Magazine.
3290829	3291810	Of course, that's in the UK.
3292570	3297793	Talking about what his interests are in the Legend of Zelda series and how he'd like to continue it.
3298173	3301776	One thing he's interested in doing is a 3D remake of A Link to the Past.
3302336	3303236	Which would be fucking awesome.
3303857	3304557	So I hope they do that.
3304597	3305738	That would be fucking awesome.
3305798	3307019	And do it in the Wind Waker engine.
3307519	3309180	None of this fucking Twilight Princess shit.
3309260	3310301	Alright, we're getting a phone call.
3310341	3311001	Let's go take it.
3311061	3312082	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3312122	3312462	Who's this?
3313675	3314616	Oh my god, I'm on!
3314936	3317298	This is Odd1 from the chat room.
3317798	3318859	I'm sorry, what was your name again?
3319940	3320100	Odd1.
3320300	3320421	Odd1!
3320641	3322002	O-D-D-O-N-E.
3322242	3322642	Yeah.
3322682	3323463	You made it.
3323603	3326585	You're a first-time live listener tonight, right?
3327526	3330889	Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for years while I was working.
3330929	3335993	You guys got me through some really tough, long hours, and I'm so grateful to you guys.
3336233	3336493	Wow.
3336614	3337694	I just want to say thanks.
3337895	3338195	Thank you.
3338815	3343239	You know, it's words like that that seriously keep us motivated, because, you know, we do this
3343934	3344494	DarkSakura.com
3371397	3373157	Honestly, I didn't think I'd get through.
3373197	3374098	I don't have much on my mind.
3374118	3375378	I just wanted to say thanks.
3375778	3379580	And now that I get free time, I'm going to be listening live every week.
3380260	3382901	Seriously, you guys are just the best.
3383121	3383762	You're welcome.
3383782	3384442	Thank you so much.
3384502	3386163	Well, then tell us about your gaming week real quick.
3386183	3387503	We'll ask you questions.
3387543	3388384	How was your gaming week?
3388404	3389324	What games have you been playing?
3391505	3394306	Man, all I got here is a GameCube right now.
3394966	3396287	Is it Gary Coleman's GameCube?
3396327	3396467	Yeah.
3400067	3401368	It's no good at all.
3401388	3401808	It's a money thing.
3401948	3402908	It's a stolen system thing.
3402968	3404249	I don't even want to go into it.
3404369	3407810	Let's say you had $400 in your pocket right now, enough to buy any of the next-gen systems.
3409670	3411011	Which one would you buy and why?
3425428	3434634	You know, I'd probably buy a Wii and about 20 million of those Wii points because especially with the Neo Geo, the virtual console is just hot.
3435655	3436856	I need that in my life.
3437096	3437716	It is hot.
3437996	3441699	Like seriously, my Wii wasn't even plugged in for about three weeks.
3442059	3447443	And I finally went and plugged it back in today because I wanted to check out some of the new stuff like the Check Me Out channel and Mario 3.
3448084	3452887	And I went back on and I saw that Simon's Quest was on virtual console and I completely forgot about it.
3453151	3456075	And when I saw it, I seriously, I think I got a semi.
3456315	3457757	Like, that game is so awesome.
3459299	3462183	Even with the shitty translation, it's fun.
3462243	3463785	What a terrible night to have a curse.
3465988	3466608	The Game Is Alive.
3490217	3494619	and don't want to hook up the whole Dreamcast and burn the CD or whatever.
3494860	3497861	There's something about it that just, I don't know, is worth the five bucks.
3499162	3503084	Well, I mean, and also, you know, I associate my computer with work.
3503993	3510455	I'll play on it, but when I want to relax, I get on my couch and turn on my TV.
3510495	3511055	That's a good point.
3511295	3515256	I don't like to play games on the computer that were originally designed for the console.
3515296	3519157	Something like World of Warcraft or PC developed games, I have no problem playing those on the PC.
3519237	3522158	Why do you think I have so many video game systems?
3522858	3524558	So you can sit on the couch.
3524578	3530320	So I can sit on my couch and use my original controller and play the game.
3530340	3531280	There you have it.
3532863	3533623	Exactly.
3534003	3534203	All right.
3534304	3535664	Well, I'm going to let you go.
3535724	3537444	Thank you so much for taking my call.
3537484	3538685	No problem, Odd1.
3538765	3540825	It's very nice to hear such enthusiasm.
3540985	3542226	It makes us even more excited.
3542266	3543366	So thank you, Odd1, for your call.
3543386	3543986	We appreciate it.
3544026	3544466	Have a good one.
3545567	3545787	Bye.
3546087	3547887	Bye-bye.
3547927	3550808	He just had so much enthusiasm, like was generally happy to be on the show.
3550848	3551348	I love that.
3551788	3552169	So great.
3552249	3552869	Thank you so much.
3553229	3553989	Let's go to another call.
3554049	3555069	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3555089	3555449	Who's this?
3555469	3557750	This is Azorme.
3558470	3559451	Hello, Azorme.
3559671	3560131	What's on your mind?
3561932	3567014	Uh, yeah, I just wanted to talk about, uh, just, like, an overall, the gaming this year.
3567894	3573236	Like, you know, it's like, this week, Mario Galaxy and Assassin's Creed is coming out.
3573696	3576457	Do y'all find it hard to keep up with all these games?
3578298	3585200	Like, I know we have, like, every, like, you're married, uh, Loki, along with, uh, DarkSakura.
3587233	3588974	This is a huge week for games.
3588994	3590456	Yeah, this is feedback.
3591296	3594279	With Christmas and everything, it's just like everything is coming out this week.
3596961	3601065	Well, I'm trying to say, do you get a chance to actually play them all?
3601105	3603027	Do you find yourself able to play them?
3603367	3604068	Uh-oh.
3604308	3608031	Like, as if you would play, like, you know, do you get all your fun out of them, like your money's worth?
3610013	3610333	What was it?
3610820	3612421	Do we have time to play all these games?
3612741	3615382	Do we have time to play all these games that come out?
3628389	3632293	I personally do not, just given that I have a very busy schedule.
3632553	3637358	I haven't gone into a lot of detail on this, but I'm working on an illustration project.
3637878	3640881	I'm still going to classes as a massage therapist.
3640941	3643003	I work as a massage therapist, too.
3643764	3651111	And with my full-time job, I don't have as much time as I would like to play some of these games, although I am dedicating time to Portal next week.
3651762	3653224	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3667344	3670805	My friends trying to get me into Tabula Rasa, which I really want to check out.
3670845	3675306	There's just all these freaking MMOs I keep getting sucked into, and those are games that never finish.
3675566	3678847	So you just keep going back for more, and I never have time to play the console games.
3679087	3681368	But I do try to play a little bit of everything.
3681928	3686349	That's what makes it so easy to stay on top of the Xbox Live Arcade releases and everything.
3686389	3689310	Those are delivered right to your doorstep, and they're usually really short games.
3689330	3693151	I try to sample as much as I can, but I may not play everything.
3693351	3694271	For example, right now,
3694904	3695304	and DarkSakura.
3708035	3708496	DarkSakura.com
3730915	3737264	And so, you know, if we have more free games, we could easily dedicate, you know, an hour between three of us, you know, playing games or whatever.
3737404	3739667	The last free game I got was Dragon's Lair HD.
3740228	3742351	I can't remember the last free game we got.
3742371	3746717	The last free game I got, and I don't want it, and I will be selling it back.
3747284	3748885	Viva Pinata Party Animals.
3749225	3749985	Aw, sorry to hear it.
3750005	3750546	I take that back.
3750626	3754367	Dan got us our Halo 3 for free and a bunch of other stuff.
3754628	3766413	The last free one I can remember getting was a Midway rep I met at a show was kind enough to give me one of those arcade classics, which was great for me because I loved that shit, those 80 games, so that was cool, but that was a long time ago.
3766853	3767814	So, I don't know.
3768074	3768834	Play Overlord.
3769154	3771195	Folks in chat are suggesting Gamefly.
3771235	3772756	Yes, I will play Overlord, I swear.
3772976	3776518	I will step away from Final Fantasy XI this week, the crack, the crack, and play some Overlord.
3777435	3780478	All right, Skype line is still open if you want to give us a call.
3780578	3789928	Just a word of advice, call Echo123 before you call us on the Skype, and that way you can hear what you sound like, and you can hear if there's any echoing or any of that stuff.
3790308	3795634	If your microphone is really close to your speakers, that's what causes the echo, so sorry, it's okay.
3796773	3798854	Any other last-minute stories real quick while we wait for some more calls?
3799055	3799695	Yeah, of course I do.
3800436	3807102	Anyways, Attack of the Show is now in the Guinness Book of World Records for creating the largest arcade machine.
3808243	3816690	It is 1,300 pounds, has 150 arcade games built into it, it's 14 feet tall, and has a 75-inch screen.
3816850	3819052	Plus, it requires quarters that are 3 inches big.
3819412	3821273	They like big things on that program, don't they?
3821293	3823154	Because they made a big Nintendo once, didn't they?
3823174	3824275	I remember that at 1E3.
3824555	3825195	They had that out there.
3825215	3827116	When I become rich, I will one-up everything they do.
3827336	3828377	All right, let's go to the phones.
3828397	3828997	We have another call.
3829257	3830358	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3830378	3830778	Who's this?
3831639	3832499	Hello?
3832519	3833660	Hi, who is this?
3833700	3834260	Hello?
3834280	3835801	This is Marissa.
3836401	3839163	Marissa!
3839263	3840223	Marissa?
3840624	3841364	What's on your mind?
3842798	3843759	I'm just calling to say hello.
3843779	3846041	It's so nice to be able to hear the show this evening.
3846361	3849184	Yeah, so it's very random that you're listening to us live.
3849204	3849604	We love it.
3849684	3851566	I said it's very random that you're listening to us live.
3851606	3852026	We love it.
3853107	3854148	It's very cool, yeah.
3854188	3858992	I actually finally came across this thing known as a computer, and I purchased one.
3859633	3863096	I had been out of one for about a year because I just didn't have the money, but now I'm back.
3863296	3868941	But I unfortunately have Windows Vista on a budget laptop, so I'm kind of screwed game-wise.
3870237	3870637	Excellent.
3870697	3876120	Now, since you have a new computer, has your gaming on the PC consisted of Solitaire and Minesweeper?
3876641	3877921	Well, since she's on Vista.
3879482	3884585	With what bloatware Vista is, yeah, because it eats all my memory.
3886106	3894231	Although I was lucky enough, I went to Target before going to Seattle to try to get some games because I took a train trip to Seattle.
3894791	3897773	And so I wanted to have something to pass the time because it's like 38 hours.
3899156	3900356	and I got King's Quest.
3902057	3902617	Awesome!
3902697	3903737	King's Quest is the shit.
3903757	3905118	They re-released all of them.
3907058	3914780	It's supposed to be compatible with Windows 2000 but it doesn't work for Vista very well but oh well, that was cool.
3915641	3918402	That sucks because the King's Quest series was amazing.
3918602	3921242	I loved those games when I was younger, especially King's Quest 4.
3921282	3923503	That was always my favorite because it was based on the fairy tales.
3924693	3925655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3932609	3933690	Very, very cool.
3933970	3934350	Very cool.
3934390	3939813	That was really cool, but I don't like these episodic games because I don't like paying $20 for like half an hour worth of game.
3940093	3940493	Here's the thing.
3940513	3947157	You've got to get GameTap because not only are all the King's Quest games available on there, but they also have the Sam & Max.
3947177	3950599	But the only bummer is you have to have an internet connection, so it's not so great for the train.
3950919	3954341	But you can play for like $9.85 a month all the new Sam & Max games.
3954481	3955541	God, I sound like a commercial.
3955841	3956222	But I wouldn't...
3957182	3957362	Oh, sweet.
3957382	3957743	Old stuff for me.
3957763	3959064	Otherwise, the dude bought an Xbox.
3959084	3959504	Oh, really?
3982062	3987146	Yeah, so now I spend my evenings falling asleep in front of the TV while he plays Medal of Honor.
3988507	3989048	Good times.
3989288	3989788	Good times.
3990289	3991750	He dates up at 360, right?
3992851	3993031	Yes.
3993531	3998375	I'm going to have to talk to you later to get his gamer tag, and I'll give you Dan's and mine.
3999096	3999776	Oh, quite simple.
3999856	4000437	Long hair, Chris.
4000937	4001798	Long hair, Chris.
4001878	4003599	Oh, that makes... My boyfriend, there you go.
4003639	4006682	You do know, like, thousands of people that hear our show just heard that, right?
4008083	4010385	If you get some more friend requests this week, you'll know why.
4012560	4018342	Well, okay, I'll go ahead and put Dan's on there, except I can't remember if it's with an underscore or not, but it would be Gunstar Hero.
4019443	4019743	Okay.
4020223	4024004	So, I'll let you know for sure later, and mine I never use, so I'll let you know later.
4024424	4028906	But if he's got Halo 3, he should totally play with Dan so I can see Dan get punked.
4029186	4029826	Let's all play Uno.
4029846	4030947	He's waiting for that, yeah.
4030987	4034368	I'm not trying to talk him into getting the orange box, because I really want to play Portal.
4034688	4035408	Yeah.
4035428	4036629	I want to stop singing the song.
4037988	4038829	Isn't this song great?
4039229	4043551	Okay, I didn't get it at first, and it was when I finally saw it that I was like, this is the best song ever.
4044552	4048634	Seriously, Jamie was, I remember when that song was in the cage match, and Jamie was like, this song is stupid.
4048694	4049855	Why do people love this song?
4049915	4062822	Well, no, I said as a song without a frame of reference, it wasn't a very good song, but now that I have the frame, now that I logged into that stupid site and took the quiz that was on it, the personality thing, I was like, holy crap, this is messed up.
4062882	4063282	I love it.
4064566	4066208	Yes, I think that's why it is so cool.
4066228	4072413	Although, it does bring a different dimension of weird when your co-worker is singing it in high-pitched falsetto while you're on the phone with a client.
4072853	4073834	Oh, that's cool.
4074014	4074334	Nice.
4075175	4076596	Well, Marissa... I'll let you guys go.
4076616	4077477	It was great catching up.
4077497	4080539	But please, please log into Xbox Live sometime and we'll play Uno.
4081480	4082200	Oh, sweet.
4082440	4084562	And I'll hook up my webcam and play Strip Uno.
4084662	4085183	No, just kidding.
4085203	4085463	Okay.
4086386	4088007	Do you have an Amazon wish list ready?
4091230	4091870	I can't wait.
4092451	4092911	All right.
4092951	4093691	Come on, baby.
4094192	4095893	Marissa, thanks so much for calling.
4096113	4096574	We love you.
4096674	4097054	Bye, Marissa.
4097074	4098675	Come back and be in the studio soon, okay?
4099496	4100216	Okay, bye.
4100316	4100877	All right, bye.
4101937	4104359	She has to come back soon so we can hear more stories about the Wunderbra.
4107702	4109443	That was it.
4109863	4110924	I thought it was the Wunderbra.
4113854	4114154	Great.
4114214	4115614	Alright, more last minute stories.
4115634	4117975	We'll take one more call if anybody calls in.
4117995	4120276	877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4120956	4125857	Anyways, there's apparently a new Bioshock achievement that someone spotted on live.
4127417	4136340	The rumor is the 51st achievement, which is actually on the list there, is 100 points and it is from, it's called Bulletproof.
4136440	4139681	Complete the game on hard difficulty without using a Vita chamber.
4140781	4141421	So, um,
4142219	4145560	Be interesting to see if this actually surfaces maybe in a new update or something like that.
4147520	4150000	Anyways, let's see here.
4151141	4154841	Benjo Kazooie 3, not coming out on 360 anymore.
4155081	4156001	It's been axed.
4156521	4157842	So, hooray.
4157902	4164543	Oh, wait, there was something about, I saw on Twitter that there was going to be big news coming out about a 360 exclusive being axed.
4164583	4165163	This must be it.
4165463	4166443	That'd be the one, I think.
4166463	4167203	Oh, snap.
4167683	4168884	All right, we're getting one more call.
4169464	4170344	Oh, it went away.
4170564	4170884	Never mind.
4172297	4175138	One more thing to kind of go back to the MAME cabinet we were talking about earlier.
4175459	4179021	Gamerator, it brings together MAME and beer.
4179301	4182243	It's a beer tap in a MAME cabinet.
4182544	4182944	Hold that thought.
4182964	4183824	We've got a call coming in.
4183864	4188167	I do want to hear more about the beer thing, but this is a conference call, so I'm always worried about these calls.
4188207	4189128	Hi, you're on Orange Lens Radio.
4189148	4189468	Who's this?
4190229	4191269	Tech and Game Podcast.
4191350	4193391	The Bucket, Tokis, and Raven's Dolphin.
4193431	4194191	What's up, you guys?
4195192	4195592	Not much.
4195652	4196893	You were talking about Sam and Max?
4197254	4197494	Yes.
4198855	4200816	Our last caller, Marissa, is a Sam and Max fan.
4201957	4202537	I am huge.
4202637	4206680	I beat the new one today, and oh my god, it's awesome.
4207040	4207300	Is it?
4207320	4209061	About how long of gaming was it?
4210041	4213203	About five hours, but they really changed up some things about it.
4213303	4218146	They added Stinky's Tavern as a restaurant, 50s theme.
4218346	4218966	Really nice.
4220567	4221247	I really love it.
4221768	4222708	Santa goes nuts.
4223149	4224109	Can't go wrong with that.
4224549	4226390	Lots of funny stuff goes great.
4227671	4231313	Is this taking a lot of time on your show recently, the Sam & Max series?
4232102	4233183	No, Call of Duty.
4234184	4234804	Call of Duty.
4235665	4236185	Well, that's cool.
4236205	4237606	Sam & Max is a good franchise.
4237646	4241870	One of those ones I need to spend more time with, but those damn MMOs, you know how it goes.
4244032	4247795	Yeah, but this one has a hint feature, so it's much easier for the noobs to get in.
4249676	4256101	Marissa in our chat room actually follows up and says, Sam & Max rules, but Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is still number one in my heart.
4257602	4258283	How about Loom?
4258443	4259704	Where's the love for Loom?
4259764	4260645	Loom is great.
4261900	4262340	is awesome.
4263501	4265082	Well, what else did you guys want to share with us?
4265122	4265522	Anything else?
4266262	4267283	Overlords on GameTap.
4267303	4268143	Download it from there.
4268624	4272746	Well, I have a copy on Xbox 360 and that way I can get achievement points because I'm a whore for achievement points.
4272886	4273286	Ah, you're right.
4273506	4273626	Yep.
4274007	4275567	I can play Jericho or something on GameTap.
4276388	4276948	Ah, Jericho.
4276968	4277789	Doesn't Jericho suck?
4278609	4281130	Well, I've heard that but I want to see that first hand if it does suck.
4281311	4282911	Okay, because that's what everyone's said to me.
4283232	4284172	Big disappointment.
4284412	4284792	It sucks.
4284812	4285073	Stay away.
4285093	4287074	That's what I keep hearing but I like to see these things first hand.
4287154	4291376	I will tell you what kind of cool zombie game I've been playing on GameTap is Typing of the Dead.
4292232	4293032	Oh, that's awesome.
4293072	4294053	I've been playing that a little.
4294653	4297414	It's a steep learning curve to get all those letters in.
4297954	4298994	I can type uber fast.
4299014	4300395	Maybe because you can't type, Raven.
4301915	4304536	You type with two fingers, Raven, you're not going to get very far doing that.
4305036	4305596	Yeah, you're right.
4306897	4309278	All right, well, kids, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show.
4309358	4310338	But thanks so much for calling.
4310358	4310798	It's fine.
4311018	4311898	Thanks for taking our call.
4311918	4312339	You're welcome.
4312359	4313079	Have a good one, you guys.
4313359	4314039	Have fun with your show.
4316200	4316500	All right.
4317400	4319521	Raven and DeBucket from Tekken Games.
4320199	4322120	which I think is beating us on Op 11 still.
4322860	4323420	You go, boys.
4324100	4325080	All right, any other last-minute stories?
4325100	4326621	You were talking about the beer and MAME machine.
4326881	4327101	Yes.
4327321	4328562	Skype line is now closed, kids.
4328622	4330022	Sorry to those who didn't get through.
4330322	4331042	The Gamerator.
4331342	4338044	It's $2,000, but it's a custom-built MAME cabinet, and it comes preloaded, of course, with 180 games.
4338504	4340785	Plus, it's got internal AV hookups.
4341285	4343526	It lets you throw your PC or console in there as well.
4344893	4370682	and then of course it comes doubles as a keg it's got tap and everything so that's awesome beer and maim together another interesting thing I guess there is a sequel to Dig Dug 2 coming I guess it's called Dig Dug Islands it's actually being Namco Bandai has partnered with Verx to produce it as an online PC game
4371812	4374233	So if you're interested in more Dig Dug, there you go.
4377115	4378976	There already was like a Dig Dug 1.5 on DS.
4378996	4379577	I had it.
4381198	4383079	Yeah, Dig Dug DS.
4383539	4384039	I have it.
4385300	4396947	Anyways, Nexen, of course that South Korean company doing a lot of MMOs and stuff, they're developing a couple games for, well, one for the Xbox 360 and one for the DS.
4396967	4397127	Yes.
4397979	4401441	MapleStory is coming to the DS, so that's one that's being worked on right now.
4401521	4406544	The other one is an MMO called Mabinogi, and that's coming to the 360.
4408204	4415268	And I guess Mabinogi is a cel-shaded MMO that looks interesting.
4415288	4420251	And then MapleStory, I think a lot of people are familiar with MapleStory, so for the DS that would be pretty cool.
4422452	4426494	And then I guess Live is doing something for their 5th anniversary starting November 15th.
4427662	4429002	Lots of parties online.
4429503	4430283	Uno for everybody.
4430543	4432864	Well, you know, that's interesting because that's starting on Wednesday.
4432924	4436825	I wonder if they got any really kick-ass Xbox Live Arcade games for that day.
4438266	4439986	They haven't said what's coming out this week, have they?
4440166	4440726	No, not yet.
4441026	4442187	Maybe they're sitting on something good.
4442607	4445568	What are some really highly anticipated games we haven't got yet?
4445628	4445948	Rez?
4446128	4447208	Rez would be fucking awesome.
4447429	4448109	Yeah, it's true.
4448129	4448629	It could be that.
4450791	4451832	I don't know.
4452032	4453832	Oh, the hella famous shooter.
4453852	4454092	Omega 5?
4454152	4454793	Treasure.
4455333	4455593	Omega 5?
4455633	4456853	No, the one that's called... Ikaruga?
4456953	4457894	Radiant Silver Gun.
4458574	4459814	Ikaruga is the one that, yeah.
4460955	4463656	But Omega 5, they've been pimping that out for a while now.
4464776	4465036	All right.
4465056	4465496	That'd be kind of cool.
4465636	4467117	Well, the party starts on Microsoft this week.
4467137	4468537	I thought Screwjumper was coming out.
4468717	4469538	Did that already come out?
4469638	4470038	Screwjumper?
4470198	4473219	Oh, I think they have confirmed that is this week's title, Screwjumper.
4473319	4474579	But there could be a second one that's really cool.
4474599	4475440	Yeah, there could be a second one.
4475460	4476380	Screwjumper looks stupid.
4477540	4478161	It might be okay.
4478181	4479081	It might be okay.
4482566	4488608	DarkSakura, thank you as always for blessing us with your presence.
4488848	4489508	What's your final thought?
4490468	4495169	My final thought is I can't find where I can save this wallpaper to so that I can make it fit my desktop.
4496190	4498790	And I'll thank myself for blessing the show with my presence.
4498810	4503892	And my final thought is I want enchiladas really bad because looking at this Aldo Berritos mug makes me crave horchatas.
4504932	4506713	Loki, thank you as always for being here.
4506993	4508153	And what's your final thought?
4508632	4509413	DMN is still doing the insanest hour
4535345	4540290	And Saturday, I believe Travis Donovan is back up and running after a little bit of a summer hiatus.
4540310	4541231	I know he had a show this week.
4541771	4546335	So hopefully by the new year, we'll be up and running with lots of shows.
4546435	4548637	We are in talks to do some stuff.
4548697	4551040	So we'll get back to you with that.
4551380	4556725	And just also the FYI, next week, week after, I will not be here.
4557506	4558146	Cry.
4558386	4559027	And the week after that.
4559383	4560183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4585450	4586010	No, we'll see.
4586610	4587331	We haven't decided yet.
4587351	4587651	I don't know.
4587751	4588531	We could use a break, though.
4588551	4594093	I take that time during Thanksgiving to travel somewhere, so I kind of want to go back to Magic Mountain.
4594474	4594734	We'll see.
4594754	4595854	I've got to find somebody to go with me, though.
4596474	4597755	Hopefully he hasn't burned down yet.
4598215	4598575	Hope not.
4599295	4599596	Hope not.
4600076	4601256	All right, well, that's it.
4601796	4605758	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

4613806	4614527	about the program.

4625916	4627257	Just help us spread the word.
4627637	4628498	We really appreciate it.
4628518	4629319	You guys are awesome.
4629899	4633142	Until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.
4633802	4634483	That is Loki.
4634743	4635764	She is Dark Sakura.
4635864	4638766	And together, we are... Are not Captain Planet.
4639587	4640788	No, we are not Captain Planet.
4642145	4645208	But we are Orange Lounge Radio, so take care and we'll see you next week.
