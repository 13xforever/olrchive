00:00.000 --> 00:21.240
Today, November 18th, 2007, Xbox 360 is getting its own virtual console of sorts, Divx is

00:21.240 --> 00:31.920
coming to PlayStation 3, and is Nintendo DS redesign on its way next year?

00:31.920 --> 00:35.240
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
Radio.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.120
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:40.120 --> 00:41.640
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.640 --> 00:46.520
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, the co-hosts that make this shiz happen, say

00:46.520 --> 00:48.600
hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.760
And Rob gave me chocolate that has booze in it.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.800
I hate to say it, but they didn't card me for it, so the alcohol is presumably cooked

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
out of the Malibu chocolate.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.640
I'm pretty sure of it, but I still think that it's very, very tasty.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.760
I've had some that has lots of alcohol in it though.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.760
That's cool.

01:03.760 --> 01:04.760
I want that.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.760
No bears.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.960
The ones that had the Grand Marnier in it, and they also had Johnny Walker.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.360
I have not heard of this.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.360
This sounds yummy.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.800
I'll have to find out where Julie got them from, but they do card you for those.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.800
I think you should do that now.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.800
No.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
Maybe you can get them at BevMo.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.240
I bet you could.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.240
All right.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.080
Say hello as well to the one and only Loki.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
Hello.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.080
How are you doing, Loki?

01:25.080 --> 01:26.880
I'm okay other than a headache.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.520
Oh, I'm sorry to hear you have a headache.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.520
Do you need some Tylenol?

01:29.520 --> 01:30.520
No, I already took some.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.520
Ibuprofen?

01:31.520 --> 01:32.520
Hammer?

01:32.520 --> 01:34.520
I already took stuff.

01:34.520 --> 01:39.040
By the way, for the lovely folks watching our webcam feed on Operator 11, you can see

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
Loki's shirt.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.040
Didn't you get this at Fonamy when we were in your life?

01:42.040 --> 01:43.040
Yeah, I got this at Fonamy.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.840
Grand Theft Amish, Penn State Dutch.

01:45.840 --> 01:46.840
Lovely.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.400
Very nice shirt there.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
Nerd.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.600
All right.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.600
Let's get into the show tonight.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.880
We'll start it off as we always do.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.440
You notice this is episode 256, though, I must say.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.800
That is kind of a landmark number.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
You know why?

02:00.800 --> 02:07.800
Well, not only is like two to a certain power, 256, but also that's one color for every color

02:07.800 --> 02:10.280
in a VGA monitor.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.280
Impressive, no?

02:11.280 --> 02:14.280
You're a geek.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.880
How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

02:15.880 --> 02:17.760
I played shit.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.760
Did you now?

02:18.760 --> 02:21.160
But I'm trying to remember what exactly I played.

02:21.160 --> 02:22.160
Oh, yeah.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.160
I played the After Burner.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.160
What was it?

02:24.160 --> 02:25.160
The After Burner arcade game.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.160
Yeah.

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
No, it was the new one.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.200
The name's on my stupid iPhone.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.320
Jamie and I went on a double date this week.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.320
Sort of.

02:33.320 --> 02:39.680
Yeah, Dan came, too, and we played a bunch of ticket games at that John's Not Very Amazing

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
Pizza or Incredible.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.600
It's John's Incredible Pizza, but we now call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is what

02:44.600 --> 02:45.600
it's called.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.600
I love it, but it's the new After Burner that came out, what, a year ago?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.600
It looked pretty rad.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.600
I didn't even know it was there.

02:50.600 --> 02:55.120
It's really, really cool, and we played a bunch of that, and I went on this Twister

02:55.120 --> 02:56.120
thing.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.120
The ride.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.120
Oh, my God.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.120
William was so funny.

02:59.120 --> 03:04.680
A big hello to the person that worked there, Chris, who stopped us and was like, you're

03:04.680 --> 03:06.240
the guy from Horizontal Radio, huh?

03:06.240 --> 03:07.240
That was kind of cool.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.640
I was like, I need to write this thing first.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.640
Ego++.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.640
What?

03:11.640 --> 03:12.640
Level up.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.640
He was recognized from the show by some guy who worked there.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.920
It was pretty awesome.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.840
So he recognized me because Dark Soccer was on the ride, and then I was like, oh, you

03:19.840 --> 03:20.840
got to go meet Janie's mom.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.160
Well, she's never on camera anyways, so I mean...

03:22.160 --> 03:23.160
That's true.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.000
You're not on Op 11, so they don't know what you look like, but she's in the album art,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.080
so I'm sure if they've done their homework, they know, and she's on the All Games page.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.080
There's a picture and all that stuff.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.720
And I've got pictures of me on my Myspace.

03:31.720 --> 03:32.720
Yeah, that's right.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.140
Because I take them with my own camera.

03:35.140 --> 03:36.140
That was awesome.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.140
Of myself.

03:37.140 --> 03:41.280
Sadly, I was not able to get free things from the ticket counter because William wanted

03:41.280 --> 03:46.480
one of those... It was something really fruity, like a princess backpack or something stupid

03:46.480 --> 03:48.240
just to make me buy it for him.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.880
I don't think it was so much that he probably wanted it, but he wanted me to buy it for

03:50.880 --> 03:51.880
him with hardware tickets.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.960
I wanted the Rock'em Sock'em robots.

03:53.960 --> 03:54.960
Those are cool.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.920
I wanted the little mini pinball game because I'm not cool like Janie, and I have 20 pinball

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
machines in my house.

03:58.920 --> 03:59.920
Oh, yeah.

03:59.920 --> 04:00.920
We traded out one of our pinballs.

04:00.920 --> 04:05.000
We're actually holding some pinball machines for a friend, and so we got rid of Time Machine,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.880
which made me sad, but we have a Black Knight now, not Black Knight 2000, but the old Black

04:08.880 --> 04:10.880
Knight, which is still a cool table.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.880
Oh, sorry.

04:11.880 --> 04:12.880
Go ahead.

04:12.880 --> 04:13.880
Go ahead.

04:13.880 --> 04:17.480
I was going to say, I'd like to mention, I'm posting a link in the chat room right now,

04:17.480 --> 04:22.600
which apparently I noticed my t-shirt had a web URL on it, so this is where you can

04:22.600 --> 04:23.600
find it.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.040
I had to go through a few links, but this guy has some other wonderful shirts, including

04:27.040 --> 04:34.100
one that's a spoof of the Clerks shirt, or I guess box art from the movie, Clerks.

04:34.100 --> 04:38.840
It says, just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.440
I think that's the same place I got my shirt that's the parody of the movie 300 that has

04:42.440 --> 04:43.440
that one guy's face on it.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.920
It says, this is Zelda.

04:44.920 --> 04:52.120
It might be from some other guy, but he also has another one from, it says, gaming is as

04:52.120 --> 04:56.160
addictive as sex, but there's no orgasm to let you know when to stop.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.720
Wow, that's classy.

04:57.720 --> 04:58.720
Okay.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.920
Back to Jamie's Gaming Week, please.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.200
Loki, Rude.

05:02.200 --> 05:08.520
So I played a lot more Ragnarok, of course, and I had a really nice game of World Cup

05:08.520 --> 05:16.200
Soccer 94, which was a very, very good game, and I actually watched the entire play through

05:16.200 --> 05:21.160
of Portal just because I watched it twice.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.800
Did the cake ever come true?

05:22.800 --> 05:23.800
No.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.080
Sorry to hear it.

05:26.080 --> 05:31.800
But I also, after the show, when I got home last week, because I had a three day weekend,

05:31.800 --> 05:34.560
because I work for a bank.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.000
Whatever.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.480
I was really bored and had bad insomnia, so I completely redid my live journal, and I

05:41.480 --> 05:48.080
now have a Portal theme with a big old lady companion cube on it.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.760
I did watch the YouTube of the poor companion.

05:50.760 --> 05:53.120
It was like a companion cube tribute on YouTube.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
Yeah, that was...

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
People have the dumbest shit on YouTube.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.120
You were laughing though.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.120
I was.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
It was funny.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.560
That one part, though, where they played the...

05:59.560 --> 06:01.560
You must now incinerate the cube or whatever.

06:01.560 --> 06:02.560
Oh, yeah, didn't they?

06:02.560 --> 06:03.560
Oh, yeah.

06:03.560 --> 06:08.320
They played the one Imogen Heap song that they always play for every death scene ever

06:08.320 --> 06:09.520
that I've ever seen.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.520
That was great.

06:10.520 --> 06:14.120
Yeah, so the video is like...

06:14.120 --> 06:15.600
It's doing its thing, and it's showing...

06:15.600 --> 06:20.380
It's like a tribute, and I was expecting Journey to come in or something, but then they have

06:20.380 --> 06:23.820
to throw the cube in the incinerator, because that's what you do in one of the missions,

06:23.820 --> 06:26.680
and then suddenly the definitive death song comes in.

06:26.680 --> 06:34.480
No, it's not the companion cube.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.320
And then they kept repeating it and speeding it up.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.320
That was the best ever.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.840
It's just like that.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.880
Forget it, I tried.

06:46.880 --> 06:47.880
iTunes just isn't friendly to do that.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.920
It's just like that one SNL digital short that they have.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.920
It is.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.280
It's a total parody of that one short.

06:52.280 --> 06:56.020
It was just the best thing ever.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.020
But I was just...

06:57.020 --> 07:00.840
Dear sister, thank you Tiger Claw in the chat room, chat.orangelester.com.

07:00.840 --> 07:01.840
But I have...

07:01.840 --> 07:06.260
And I'll try to find the walkthrough I was watching, but I was watching part seven of

07:06.260 --> 07:10.560
the walkthrough, because that's my favorite one, because that's the one where the computer

07:10.560 --> 07:16.640
goes starts going nuts and says, you must lay down in the party retrieval position.

07:16.640 --> 07:17.640
Wow.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.640
All right.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.000
We got to move on.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.240
We don't want to have a portal show tonight.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.240
That was great.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.240
All right.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.240
Loki, how was your gaming week?

07:24.240 --> 07:25.240
My gaming week was okay.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.360
We played Earth Defense Force 2017 again.

07:29.360 --> 07:36.600
We went back to that and actually did pretty well on the Inferno levels.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.160
Hopefully going to try to finish that game eventually.

07:39.160 --> 07:45.720
I tried a little bit of Mass Effect and there's a whole lot of talking in that game.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.740
They really like to just use that.

07:49.740 --> 07:53.480
They're like, man, we made a really cool conversation system.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.480
Let's constantly use it.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.040
It's like, my God, shut the hell up.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.200
I want to go on a mission already.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.320
You have the best game reviews, Loki.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
Yeah.

08:03.320 --> 08:07.080
So I play Mass Effect and it's a lot of talking.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.480
It seriously is.

08:08.480 --> 08:11.840
It's just like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.600
Oh my God.

08:13.600 --> 08:19.680
You're here for some reason that's not good or something and there's something going on.

08:19.680 --> 08:20.680
I wonder what it is.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.800
To this point I'm like, I don't know who you are, nor do I care what's going on.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.600
I just want to go fight something.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.880
When I did go fight something, there were these stupid little flying things that shot

08:31.880 --> 08:33.960
lasers at me.

08:33.960 --> 08:38.760
My guys basically, I had one of my away team members, it must have been Sergeant I'm going

08:38.760 --> 08:43.280
to die or something because fucker just ran up, started shooting at it and just stood

08:43.280 --> 08:48.480
out in the middle of the open instead of taking cover like a smart person and died instantly.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.640
Naturally there's feedback from the chat room here.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.720
Odd One says, Dear God, an RPG where I have to talk to people?

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
What the hell?

08:56.720 --> 09:00.920
No, but they go on and on and on and on and on.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.100
I actually was skimming through it.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.440
If I wanted to talk to everybody, I could do that as well and it's just, huh.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.760
SSJ100Matt in chat.orangelshooter.com says, They spent a lot on voice actors, Loki.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.760
They got to use them.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.760
Oh yeah, true.

09:14.760 --> 09:15.760
But no, they got me wrong.

09:15.760 --> 09:21.120
Dr. Uno invokes Elvis and says, A little more conversation, or no, a little less conversation,

09:21.120 --> 09:22.600
a little more action please.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
Get it?

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
Get it?

09:24.600 --> 09:31.760
I mean, but to be fair, I played this game during a lunch, only half of a lunch, so about

09:31.760 --> 09:32.960
30 minutes.

09:32.960 --> 09:38.000
But dude, it took me 25 minutes to actually see some action in this game.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
That's pretty bad.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.840
But hey, it's going to be pretty cool, so I'm looking forward to playing a little more

09:43.840 --> 09:49.360
of the game when I stop playing other games, which one of those other games, of course,

09:49.360 --> 09:54.080
would be Rock Band.

09:54.080 --> 09:59.720
I don't want to sound like a fanboy for Rock Band because I bought Guitar Hero 2 a long

09:59.720 --> 10:04.000
time ago and didn't play that much of it.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.800
Rock Band, though, has actually got me excited about music games again.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.000
It's worth playing.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I like it.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
I think it's pretty fun.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.440
That's a big fucking statement there.

10:12.440 --> 10:17.880
I mean, I'm actually working my way through the game on starting on easy and kind of building

10:17.880 --> 10:21.560
up from there, but it's pretty awesome.

10:21.560 --> 10:26.760
The equipment that comes with it, the controllers and stuff, they look quality.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.200
Let me put it this way.

10:29.200 --> 10:34.280
I know they still are kind of like toys, but they look a lot less like toys than, say,

10:34.280 --> 10:40.760
the Guitar Hero controllers, which look like fucking KB toy shit, because you put them

10:40.760 --> 10:42.920
side by side and you're like, oh my god.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.720
I was actually playing on that one time.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.000
The drums are good, although I cannot play drums in the house anymore because my wife

10:50.000 --> 10:51.960
has told me not to because it's too loud.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.160
They are very loud, those drums.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.160
It's fun.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.400
I really like the drums in the game.

10:58.400 --> 11:03.000
I have not touched the vocal part of the game yet, but the microphone that comes with it

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
is really nice.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.080
I hear, though, you can use any USB microphone and it will work just fine.

11:09.080 --> 11:13.760
Also, I hear the rumor about the Guitar Hero 3 controllers not working in the game is false.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.640
They do work in the game.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.960
I was going to say, that's what they were using for the demo unit at the Best Buy near

11:20.960 --> 11:24.200
my house.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.440
I had known I had seen them before somewhere.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.920
But I like the guitars that came with the Rock Band game.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
Those are nice guitars.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
They are nice.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
They are really nice.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.560
The drums are pretty cool.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.280
They get put together pretty fast.

11:37.280 --> 11:42.920
I'm still having trouble coordinating both the drums and the kick drum, but I have that

11:42.920 --> 11:46.920
problem with drum mania as well.

11:46.920 --> 11:51.160
But compared to the drum mania home game, this thing, once again, looks less like a

11:51.160 --> 11:52.160
toy.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.280
Can I bring the box in here for the OP11 people?

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
Nothing is huge.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.960
I want to show the people how epic it is.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.080
Keep talking about your game week.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.080
By the way, for those folks on OP11, after tonight's program, we're going to be back

12:03.080 --> 12:04.080
going live.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.000
We'll actually show you Rock Band and everything that's in it and play the game a little bit.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.280
Loki is sworn up and down though.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.280
He won't sing though.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.240
We'll try our best.

12:12.240 --> 12:15.400
One of the other things that's neat about the game is you can actually create your own

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
character in it.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.040
I know that sounds stupid, but you actually want to play the game more so you unlock more

12:20.040 --> 12:23.320
money so that you can buy more things for your character.

12:23.320 --> 12:27.080
It's funny because I actually created a guy that's my guitarist because apparently you

12:27.080 --> 12:30.800
can't use the same character for everything.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.960
That box is fucking huge, I must say.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.280
When I saw that, I'm like, holy crap, that thing is huge.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.240
It's a good 20 pounds when it's full of all the equipment.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.440
It's a big, big box, and it's not even full right now.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.440
That makes sense though.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.440
Yeah, I know.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.400
The other bad thing about it, and I had to cut a hole in the side of that box because

12:50.400 --> 12:54.280
right now I'm using up the carry stuff back and forth, is once you put the guitar together

12:54.280 --> 12:59.280
because the little top part snaps on, it doesn't fit in the box anymore, so I had to cut a

12:59.280 --> 13:02.760
hole in the box for the guitar.

13:02.760 --> 13:08.040
You can create your own characters, I actually created an emo goth guy called Azrael for

13:08.040 --> 13:15.320
my guitarist because that's what I was trying to do, but you couldn't fit Azrael the best

13:15.320 --> 13:19.480
Prince of Sorrow in there, so I just had to stick with Azrael.

13:19.480 --> 13:25.360
It's pretty cool though, he looks kind of neat now.

13:25.360 --> 13:35.480
My main character, Loki, who's playing drums, has the Dr. Who jacket, which is kind of neat.

13:35.480 --> 13:39.640
There's a lot of things though, like one of the guitars in the game is actually a chainsaw,

13:39.640 --> 13:44.920
which is kind of neat, and then you can create probably a lot of characters that look like

13:44.920 --> 13:49.260
Sephiroth or Vincent and stuff, because there's a lot of outfits that look like you could

13:49.260 --> 13:51.120
make characters that look like other things.

13:51.120 --> 13:56.680
I loved the way that the custom characters interface themselves so well into the flow

13:56.680 --> 13:58.800
of the game.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.040
They look like they're in pre-rendered movies.

14:02.040 --> 14:08.140
In the game, their mouths are synced up with the lyrics and everything, their plane is

14:08.140 --> 14:13.520
synced up with the song, so they're not just fake strumming of the guitar and stuff, it's

14:13.520 --> 14:18.400
actually synced up with the song, and the drummer actually drums to the song, so it's

14:18.400 --> 14:20.160
pretty realistic.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.520
I like the film grainy design.

14:23.520 --> 14:28.120
I think that's how they get away with it, because I think by using that grainy film

14:28.120 --> 14:30.360
thing, they're not doing it as high of a resolution as you think.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.520
I think that's their way of getting around it, but it works.

14:33.520 --> 14:37.460
Hats off to them for finding a cheap trick that works.

14:37.460 --> 14:42.420
But it is funny, they're watching this really emo-looking guy singing Timmy and the Lords

14:42.420 --> 14:46.280
of the Underworld.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.820
Freeze pop song, A++.

14:48.820 --> 14:49.820
It's a pretty cool game.

14:49.820 --> 14:54.120
They unlock the tracks pretty easy too, they have a bonus little venue that you play that

14:54.120 --> 14:59.320
unlocks all the unlockable tracks, but in order to be able to play the songs in practice

14:59.320 --> 15:01.240
mode or whatever, you have to play them through the game.

15:01.240 --> 15:06.840
I don't know, it's pretty nice, but I really recommend picking it up if you can find it,

15:06.840 --> 15:09.160
I just know they're going to be really hard to find.

15:09.160 --> 15:13.180
But if you can't find the game with all the instruments, and you don't really care about

15:13.180 --> 15:16.920
drums too much, you can always pick up a USB microphone and just use your normal Guitar

15:16.920 --> 15:20.080
Hero guitar with the game only, and save yourself some money that way.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.080
I'll tell you right now where to get Rock Band.

15:22.080 --> 15:30.080
If you go there the morning of the 20th, Tuesday when it comes out, Kmart, no one shops Kmart.

15:30.080 --> 15:34.200
They might not be getting that many though, see that's the thing, everyone's allocations

15:34.200 --> 15:39.000
are cut, so go to Best Buy or something like that if you can.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.680
Anything else for your gaming week?

15:44.680 --> 15:48.840
My gaming week, not too incredibly exciting because I've been going back and forth between

15:48.840 --> 15:51.600
Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I've been playing both.

15:51.600 --> 15:59.680
I got my Corsair up to level 19 in Final Fantasy XI, and World of Warcraft, the 2.3 patch came

15:59.680 --> 16:02.880
out, so I've just been trying to get used to all the changes with that, but I've got

16:02.880 --> 16:07.560
to say they did a lot of really good subtle things that are great.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.400
For instance, you know how there were fetch quests?

16:10.400 --> 16:14.600
Go around and collect the weeds, or go around and find the empty boxes.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.720
Sometimes you would have to wave your mouse around the screen until it turns that little

16:18.720 --> 16:20.920
gear icon so you could find where the things are.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.200
Now those items sparkle when you're on the quest, so it makes it a lot easier to see,

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
which is cool.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.720
Little subtle things like that are neat.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.320
When you're looking at the map and you get attacked, the screen flashes red, so you know

16:30.320 --> 16:31.560
you're being beat up.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.680
It's cool, good times.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.920
The patch was very cool, and Final Fantasy XI, I'm just looking forward to the Wings

16:37.920 --> 16:41.760
of the Goddess expansion because Dancer sounds awesome.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.440
I never thought I'd say that, but Dancer, it's a battle healer.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.440
How cool is that?

16:46.440 --> 16:48.520
Dancers are battle healers.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.960
Scholars seems kind of interesting too.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.080
That's sort of how dancers are in Ragnarok.

16:52.080 --> 16:58.040
Yes, and I think in the, well no, because in Tactics they were just female bards.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.040
They were more buffers.

16:59.040 --> 17:03.840
Oh yeah, they do more buffing, but they have like range healing and stuff like that.

17:03.840 --> 17:07.080
That's exactly how they made them in Final Fantasy XI, is that they're kind of like buffers,

17:07.080 --> 17:11.720
but with that range healing, but yet they can provoke the monster and they're like tanks.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
It's crazy.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
That's interesting.

17:13.720 --> 17:14.720
Do they dance, fight?

17:14.720 --> 17:17.600
They just shake their ass.

17:17.600 --> 17:18.960
You can be a Galka dancer.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.840
There's videos on YouTube of the Galka dances.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.280
It's awesome.

17:22.280 --> 17:26.560
You use your TP to do attacks, but the thing is, it's like the first job I can think of

17:26.560 --> 17:30.400
where you don't have to have 100% TP to do the special attacks, there's scenes you can

17:30.400 --> 17:34.680
do with like 30 TP or 60, and TP is the stuff you build up as you attack.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.000
It's toilet paper.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.720
Not that kind of TP, not for your bunk hole.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.160
You throw your toilet paper at them.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.360
But then they do little jigs.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.360
It's cute.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.480
I also forgot, if you don't mind.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.480
I'm sure.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.480
I did make the guild for Ragnarok.

17:47.480 --> 17:52.240
I would like to congratulate Ranma as being our first member.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.200
Congrats.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.880
And the guild is just Orange Lounge Radio.

17:58.880 --> 17:59.880
Very cool.

17:59.880 --> 18:00.880
So look for the icon.

18:00.880 --> 18:01.880
Check that out.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.880
All right.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.120
I'll have to show you the YouTube edge of the Galka dances later.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
I have to see that.

18:06.120 --> 18:10.720
Op 11 is slowing down our stream a little bit because we're doing too much bandwidth.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.000
I can't handle it.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
What else did I play?

18:13.000 --> 18:17.480
Really quickly, I played that new word searching game on Xbox 360, just the demo.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.680
I was a little disappointed that it's just basically an over-glorified word search game.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.960
Just kind of seems like a casual game.

18:23.960 --> 18:27.000
Something that Mom might like, I don't know.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.160
Mutant Storm Empire, though, much improved over the first Mutant Storm.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.960
I think I need to go back and buy that one.

18:32.960 --> 18:37.920
I think the greatest change they made to it is that they made levels feel more like levels

18:37.920 --> 18:42.680
where it's almost like Smash TV kind of where you're walking through from room to room,

18:42.680 --> 18:46.280
and it doesn't have that really slow loading time transition between the different rooms.

18:46.280 --> 18:50.720
Did you download the free Carcassone?

18:50.720 --> 18:51.720
Carcassone?

18:51.720 --> 18:52.720
Carcassone.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.840
Carcassone is something you cook for dinner, I think.

18:54.840 --> 18:55.840
Carcassone.

18:55.840 --> 18:56.840
Carcassone.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.840
Carcassone, I already had it.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
I got ripped off.

18:59.840 --> 19:06.400
I bought Carcassone like two months ago, not when it was first out, but about a month after

19:06.400 --> 19:10.440
it was first out I bought Carcassone, so I was kind of pissed when I heard that it was

19:10.440 --> 19:11.440
out for free.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.440
But what can you do?

19:12.440 --> 19:14.720
That kind of stuff happens.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.520
That's pretty much it.

19:16.520 --> 19:20.160
Pika Uno played Screwjumper and said it sucks balls.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.360
Oh yeah, this week's releases kind of suck balls.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.960
All I heard is that Pika Uno beat my Boom Boom Rocket score, so I know what game I got

19:26.960 --> 19:28.320
to play this week.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.480
And maybe, maybe I will use the guitar.

19:30.480 --> 19:34.560
You know what we have to do, Rob, what we didn't do last week?

19:34.560 --> 19:35.560
Metroid!

19:35.560 --> 19:36.560
We haven't done the play for the past three months.

19:36.560 --> 19:41.640
And I'm leaving on Thursday, so we'll have to do it like early this week.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.640
Soon.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.240
I don't work Thursday and Friday, thankfully, but you're like, oh, I'm going to leave.

19:46.240 --> 19:51.120
I'm leaving midnight, like when it turns midnight.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.200
So we'll have to do it on Tuesday.

19:53.200 --> 19:58.840
Well, let's get into some housekeeping, speaking of Jamie leaving.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.760
Jamie will be on vacation for the next two weeks from the show, so she's not going to

20:02.760 --> 20:04.440
be here next week or the week after.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.440
Cry.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.440
How dare she.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.440
But Rob!

20:07.440 --> 20:08.440
What?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.440
Fried chicken.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.160
Maybe she'll bless us with her presence via the telephone.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.160
Who knows?

20:12.160 --> 20:13.160
Maybe.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.160
We'll see.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.460
You know, monkeys might, never mind.

20:16.460 --> 20:20.980
I don't know if we'll have somebody else here or if it'll just be the Loki and Rob show.

20:20.980 --> 20:24.960
I'm going to try to reach out to Rice Princess so we can have a female perspective of Jamie's

20:24.960 --> 20:25.960
absence.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
I'll have you know.

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
But I don't know if she can make it.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.960
I'll have you know, Rob.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.960
The Wee Zapper comes out next week.

20:29.960 --> 20:30.960
Oh!

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
Oh, I have one.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.160
Oh, how'd you do that already?

20:33.160 --> 20:36.400
Freebies from the Game Crazy Manager thing.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.680
How does that work?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.240
What do we have that uses it?

20:39.240 --> 20:42.260
But we have one!

20:42.260 --> 20:43.260
We have a Wee Zapper.

20:43.260 --> 20:44.260
All right.

20:44.260 --> 20:45.960
But there's Link's crossbow training.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.320
Oh yeah, I didn't care about that.

20:49.320 --> 20:54.240
So yeah, the great Loki and Rob challenge with the Wee Zapper might go down in Jamie's

20:54.240 --> 20:55.240
absence.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.520
You should have Nellie come on the show.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.520
Yeah, she doesn't want to.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.520
Perhaps.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.520
She's got to watch The Desperate Housewives.

21:00.520 --> 21:01.520
A little briber.

21:01.520 --> 21:06.360
What few episodes are left while the writer's guild's striking?

21:06.360 --> 21:09.920
I told Dan to come on the show with me after I get back.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.920
You should.

21:10.920 --> 21:11.920
Have him do that.

21:11.920 --> 21:12.920
Dan on the show is...

21:12.920 --> 21:13.920
Comedy.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.920
Yeah, it's hilarity.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.640
Dan at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza was pretty funny.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.440
I think, didn't he coin the phrase John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

21:21.440 --> 21:22.440
No, that was me.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.440
That was you.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
He had another term for it.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
I don't remember what it was.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.440
Incredibly Sucky Pizza.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.440
Yeah, John's Incredible World of Suck or something.

21:27.440 --> 21:28.440
Yeah.

21:28.440 --> 21:31.040
All right, anyway.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.000
Our poor friend who works there.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.760
Also housekeeping, muy importante, big news, huge, did you hear?

21:38.760 --> 21:43.300
It's like all over a lot of podcast sites that you probably listen to.

21:43.300 --> 21:48.760
There is now an official Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic on Xbox Live Marketplace.

21:48.760 --> 21:55.480
It was part of the Xbox Live 5 celebration because Xbox has turned five years old last

21:55.480 --> 22:02.040
week and a shitload of free gamer pics went up, 15 of them all from the AllGames.com family.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.160
We are one of those.

22:03.160 --> 22:08.800
Big thanks to Afro Guy who kind of like, he made the icons for us initially, but unfortunately

22:08.800 --> 22:10.980
when they resized they didn't look right.

22:10.980 --> 22:16.200
So Loki kind of took them, took the idea and redid it and did it in this pixel art thing.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.640
So it kind of gives it a cool little retro look to it.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.320
So it's an OLR gamer pic.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.920
Actually that's now our Guild emblem too.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.680
And it's actually the emblem for the Guitar Hero 3 band too.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.680
So check that out.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.120
Good job, Loki, and good job Afro Guy for making the...

22:30.120 --> 22:34.640
Although resizing it to 24 by 24 was a pain in the ass.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.360
It was, yeah, resizing the picture was horrendous.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.360
That's not the size, but...

22:38.360 --> 22:41.120
Well, I mean, but that's the size I had to use for Ragnarok.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.120
Oh, for Ragnarok.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.600
Oh, I thought you meant the gamer pic.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
No.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
I was like, oh, oh.

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
All right.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
So check that out.

22:47.600 --> 22:51.040
Please go to the marketplace and look for Community Gamer Picks 2 and check that out.

22:51.040 --> 22:57.660
Might I also add there is lots of other great podcasts in Community Gamer Picks 1 and hopefully

22:57.660 --> 23:01.520
someday there'll be a Community Gamer Picks 3, but more you guys have to download them

23:01.520 --> 23:06.160
and use them and then they go, oh, people like this stuff, so we should get more blogs

23:06.160 --> 23:11.680
and more indie shows and that stuff in there, so very cool.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.360
Also after tonight's show, I think I already mentioned this, on Operator 11, a special

23:15.360 --> 23:20.900
live preview for Rock Band, and last week we did one for Mario Galaxy and the folks

23:20.900 --> 23:25.020
in chat really seemed to like that and it was very well received.

23:25.020 --> 23:28.740
So I'm hoping we can do more of these in the future in these live preview shows on Sundays

23:28.740 --> 23:30.520
and other Op 11 specials.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.100
All right.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.840
That's all I can think of for housekeeping.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.080
If no one else has anything, then we go to...

23:36.080 --> 23:41.520
Actually, yeah, because I did get asked a question, just to let you know, my character

23:41.520 --> 23:45.520
in Ragnarok that I've got the guild on, her name is Cecily, C-S-S-I-L-Y, if you look

23:45.520 --> 23:50.880
for that character, if I'm on it, then you'll find me.

23:50.880 --> 23:55.200
So if you want to be added to the guild, I got asked.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.440
Also other questions from chat, Mac Man says, Sky, drunk show?

23:58.440 --> 24:02.680
No, because I have to work the Monday after the four-day weekend, so not likely, but you

24:02.680 --> 24:08.840
never know, stay tuned to the station, you never know when we'll go live randomly.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.320
And let's see, what else do we have?

24:10.320 --> 24:11.320
I thought there was another one I wanted to see.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.680
Oh, Gerardo Mo says, can Loki sing in the preview?

24:13.680 --> 24:14.680
I don't know.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.440
I don't know, you're going to have to bribe him.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.680
I don't know, Loki, what do you think?

24:20.680 --> 24:23.320
Could you at least read us some news in a tingle outfit?

24:23.320 --> 24:24.320
No.

24:24.320 --> 24:27.440
All right, could you at least read us some news?

24:27.440 --> 24:28.440
Yeah.

24:28.440 --> 24:36.000
Anyways, so there was a big announcement about the fall update, or winter update, I guess,

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
now.

24:37.000 --> 24:42.680
Actually, it kind of leaked out first that the Xbox originals are going to be made available

24:42.680 --> 24:43.680
to download.

24:43.680 --> 24:49.720
What those are basically going to be is just a selection of original Xbox games that you

24:49.720 --> 24:52.240
can download straight to your hard drive and play.

24:52.240 --> 24:57.360
So this is actually going to be happening, it has been confirmed, and let's see, each

24:57.360 --> 25:04.060
one is going to be approximately $15, or 1200 Microsoft points, and will be made available

25:04.060 --> 25:08.000
on December 4th as part of the fall update, of course.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.720
The first batch of these games, I guess, and I'm not sure if they're all going to be available

25:12.720 --> 25:19.600
day one, Halo, Psychonauts, Crimson Skies, and Fable.

25:19.600 --> 25:24.320
So those are ones that have been confirmed.

25:24.320 --> 25:31.560
There were some other third party ones that were also reported, which were Indigo Prophecy,

25:31.560 --> 25:36.440
Crash Bandicoot, Wrath of the Cortex, and Burnout 3, which I thought was a pretty good

25:36.440 --> 25:39.400
Burnout game.

25:39.400 --> 25:45.160
Let's see here, also as part of the fall update, of course, that Parental Timer, and then who

25:45.160 --> 25:49.640
knows what else they'll throw in there as well, but that's mainly the big thing.

25:49.640 --> 25:57.320
Although if you're expecting some wonderful things from these Xbox originals, time to

25:57.320 --> 26:03.720
kind of calm down a little bit, because they're really just downloadable Xbox games, that's

26:03.720 --> 26:04.720
it.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.760
I mean, they're emulated through the same software that emulates the current Xbox games

26:07.760 --> 26:12.640
that you can just pop a disk in there, so all the bugs that were in those emulations

26:12.640 --> 26:16.320
are going to be the same thing on these download titles.

26:16.320 --> 26:20.180
So in other words, if you thought Microsoft was going to take the Virtual Console idea

26:20.180 --> 26:22.960
and do it better, wrong.

26:22.960 --> 26:29.200
Yeah, basically, they're going to have choppiness when the game's loading up.

26:29.200 --> 26:34.160
Also if there's content like demos and stuff, selecting them might actually crash the game.

26:34.160 --> 26:39.600
You know, stuff that's on these original Xbox games, so it's really just straight port and

26:39.600 --> 26:41.720
they're just available to download.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.440
No achievements, no nothing.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.440
So that's it.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.640
It's a little bit of a big deal.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.520
But cool news for people that maybe missed it, because there's some people who didn't

26:52.520 --> 26:56.080
buy an Xbox One who have an Xbox 360, you know what I mean?

26:56.080 --> 26:57.360
So that might be good for them.

26:57.360 --> 27:00.640
So I mean, if you're up to it, they will be made available.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.560
Obviously this is an optional purchase.

27:02.560 --> 27:08.040
You don't necessarily need to buy it, but I don't know.

27:08.040 --> 27:12.920
Now our favorite webmaster in the whole wide world, VXJsonXV, brings up a good point and

27:12.920 --> 27:16.320
says, but they're on the HD, which means they're fast.

27:16.320 --> 27:21.920
HD-based gaming equals heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

27:21.920 --> 27:22.920
That's true, right?

27:22.920 --> 27:25.360
If they're on the hard drive, they ought to at least load a little faster, right?

27:25.360 --> 27:30.840
Possibly, but then again, they're being emulated, remember, and emulation can be slower sometimes.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.560
I guess that's true, but they're being emulated anyway if you put a disk in there.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.560
True, yeah.

27:34.560 --> 27:37.040
So I guess versus a disk, it would be a little bit faster.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.360
But still, I probably wouldn't buy these things if I still have the disk sitting around.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.360
Exactly.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.720
The other thing too is some of these games are pretty old.

27:43.720 --> 27:47.120
You can probably find them really cheap if you really wanted to look for them.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.000
Maybe this would be incentive, if they make money off this, maybe this would be incentive

27:50.000 --> 27:55.460
for them to go back in the Xbox archive, because they haven't touched the backwards compatibility

27:55.460 --> 28:00.600
in a long time and made some more games backwards compatible, like DDR, still not backwards

28:00.600 --> 28:02.440
compatible, right?

28:02.440 --> 28:05.000
Maybe this would be incentive for them to go dip in the library and make some old stuff

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
backwards compatible.

28:06.000 --> 28:11.480
But I swear to God, if they make things like Silent Hill 2 and Silent... Was Silent Hill

28:11.480 --> 28:12.480
3 on Xbox?

28:12.480 --> 28:13.480
I think it was.

28:13.480 --> 28:14.880
I only had 2 and 4, so I don't know.

28:14.880 --> 28:18.440
No, I don't think it was, because I was playing it on PS2.

28:18.440 --> 28:23.920
But my copies vanished probably when I moved, so I would download that shit in a heartbeat,

28:23.920 --> 28:25.720
just to have the load times and stuff.

28:25.720 --> 28:28.520
Some of that stuff is going to be cool, I think.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.520
We'll see.

28:29.520 --> 28:33.120
Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to mention during housekeeping that I totally forgot,

28:33.120 --> 28:38.840
because we forgot to note it on our little notes thingy internally here, is that this

28:38.840 --> 28:41.240
is great, what's been released from our community.

28:41.240 --> 28:45.720
It's on the forums, and it's something called OL Revolution.

28:45.720 --> 28:51.400
It's basically a step mania pack with all these songs that are based on inside jokes

28:51.400 --> 28:53.000
from the show.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.200
There's some completely horrid stuff in there, like five years ago when we would go on the

28:58.200 --> 29:01.360
stream randomly and I would sing over DDR songs.

29:01.360 --> 29:05.720
People recorded that shit somehow and have stepped it.

29:05.720 --> 29:10.240
And some of those god-awful DMN remixes that he's taken, and I say that with love, that

29:10.240 --> 29:14.320
he's taken bits and pieces of our show and put them over DDR songs, they're all in there

29:14.320 --> 29:15.320
with steps.

29:15.320 --> 29:21.200
And then things that are in-jokes to other shows on the station, just hilarious.

29:21.200 --> 29:25.660
It's all in the forums, check it out, ask Dark Tetsuya, I think he spearheaded the whole

29:25.660 --> 29:26.660
thing.

29:26.660 --> 29:27.660
I just think that was very cool.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.960
I think this has been, what, two years in the making?

29:28.960 --> 29:34.200
It's been a long time in the making, but they even, somebody did the voices, it wasn't us,

29:34.200 --> 29:38.080
but I think it was DMN, I don't know, or Travis, I can't tell, because they actually have somebody

29:38.080 --> 29:40.800
in the opening going, Orange Lounge Revolution.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.800
That's our Tetsuya.

29:41.800 --> 29:42.800
Is it really?

29:42.800 --> 29:43.800
Yeah, I think so.

29:43.800 --> 29:44.800
Oh wow.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.800
And they actually have little incidental musics that we use on our station, and some of the

29:47.800 --> 29:50.000
shit I don't even know where they found, but they got it.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.160
So props to them.

29:53.160 --> 29:57.360
But I swear to god, if that shit gets out, that karaoke stuff gets out there too much,

29:57.360 --> 29:58.360
I'm gonna have issues.

29:58.360 --> 30:02.080
We're gonna have words, Dark Tetsuya, in the parking lot.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.080
I'll kick your butt in.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.080
Rock Band, which you were talking about a little earlier in the game, and lots and lots

30:06.080 --> 30:10.240
of news coming out on Rock Band as the game gets closer and closer to release, including

30:10.240 --> 30:15.600
information about the download packs, and Rock Band has decided they've gotta stick

30:15.600 --> 30:20.360
it to Guitar Hero 3 by making the packs a little bit cheaper, instead of 500 points

30:20.360 --> 30:24.320
for Guitar Hero 3 packs, 440 Microsoft points.

30:24.320 --> 30:28.280
That equates to, do the math in your head, $5.49.

30:28.280 --> 30:31.760
But you don't just have to buy songs in packs.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.960
You can buy individual songs.

30:33.960 --> 30:38.400
It could go anywhere from 80 Microsoft points to 240 Microsoft points.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.680
That's 99 cents to just under three bucks.

30:41.680 --> 30:46.080
Most of them, they say, will be $1.99, 159 Microsoft points.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.280
159 Microsoft points?

30:48.280 --> 30:51.960
I'm gonna have all these leftover stupid points somewhere.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.000
Just do 160.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.680
And I mean, they have so much stuff coming out just when the game comes out.

30:58.680 --> 31:03.320
They have on November 20th, the Metallica pack, the Police pack, the Queens of the Stone

31:03.320 --> 31:08.760
Age pack, and some individual tracks such as My Sharona and Cherry Bomb.

31:08.760 --> 31:12.600
I would also like to point out that the week of November 27th, while Jamie is gone and

31:12.600 --> 31:15.440
she can't play it, there's a David Bowie pack coming out.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.440
Haha.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.440
Who says I can't play it?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.960
Are you gonna have Rock Band in Alabama?

31:19.960 --> 31:20.960
Haha.

31:20.960 --> 31:24.400
I really wanna get back.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.840
Black Sabbath pack comes out on December 4th.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.120
That is so getting downloaded.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.520
And December 18th, look at this.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.520
Some individual tracks.

31:33.520 --> 31:38.800
First, you get a Pretender song, Brass in Pocket, Weezer, Buddy Holly, Just For You,

31:38.800 --> 31:43.160
Dark Sakura, God Is Listening, My Iron Lung by Radiohead on December 18th.

31:43.160 --> 31:44.160
Yee!

31:44.160 --> 31:45.160
There you have it.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.160
I loves me some Radiohead.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.960
But see, it's kinda cool that they have stuff coming out each week.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.480
That is very cool.

31:50.480 --> 31:51.480
I hope it continues.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.240
I hope it gets stuff on Christmas.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.240
We'll see.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.520
I don't know.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.520
I don't wanna buy like some of these.

31:58.520 --> 32:01.000
Fortunate Son actually sounded kinda cool.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.520
I like the fact that they have some individual pricing to it as well.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.520
That's very cool.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.160
Cuz you got, yeah, not all this I'm gonna wanna buy.

32:07.160 --> 32:10.000
Like, you know, but, yeah.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
I'm very happy.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.360
Well, for anyone who is looking for these on Guitar Hero 3, there is a free Boss Battle

32:18.360 --> 32:25.080
download pack that's basically just the devil went down to Georgia and all the other three,

32:25.080 --> 32:26.800
you know, the three Boss Battle songs.

32:26.800 --> 32:28.800
So that's pretty cool.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.920
But I think that the best part about it is that it's free.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.960
I like free.

32:32.960 --> 32:33.960
Free is good.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.800
So you can play these outside of career mode.

32:36.800 --> 32:37.960
Awesome.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.040
Anyways, something not...

32:40.040 --> 32:41.040
Wait, wait, wait.

32:41.040 --> 32:45.080
Yeah, I ran out real quick but I wanted to comment on that.

32:45.080 --> 32:48.140
I'm glad they did it for free cuz otherwise we all would have been screaming that it was

32:48.140 --> 32:51.720
pay to unlock content because those songs were kind of already in the game.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.180
But I think it's a nice little extra.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.560
It's nothing huge.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.840
But The Devil Went Down to Georgia is an awesome song so I'm really glad they made that available

32:58.840 --> 32:59.840
to play whenever I want.

32:59.840 --> 33:00.840
I like that cover.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.840
Yes.

33:01.840 --> 33:02.840
So, good jobs.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.840
Okay, now, Loki, you can go.

33:04.840 --> 33:10.640
Anyways, so UK retailer Tesco actually slipped up because on their online store they were

33:10.640 --> 33:18.320
selling the Xbox 360 holiday bundle which is normally 340 pounds.

33:18.320 --> 33:22.480
They were selling it for only 33 pounds.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.720
Whoopsie.

33:24.720 --> 33:32.300
And apparently it was long enough for a number of customers to order the system and although

33:32.300 --> 33:37.040
Sky News is saying that once the payment is accepted, trading standards rules in the UK

33:37.040 --> 33:47.920
state that the retailer must comply and deliver the product, however, they have said despite

33:47.920 --> 33:52.800
the rules, Tesco site maintains that they do not have to conform to erroneously marked

33:52.800 --> 33:57.820
prices unless they fail to notice before shipment.

33:57.820 --> 33:59.200
So they may renege all of it.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.500
That's gonna cause a stink.

34:02.500 --> 34:07.960
But there was apparently some consumers, like one that ordered 39 consoles, although none

34:07.960 --> 34:12.000
of them have been delivered yet, so good job.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.480
They'd have to do at least a full refund on price.

34:14.480 --> 34:18.640
Yeah, especially like, you know, you consider that guy probably thought he was doing a smart

34:18.640 --> 34:19.640
thing.

34:19.640 --> 34:22.880
Hopefully they won't try to like charge him for all those Xbox 360s or he's not gonna

34:22.880 --> 34:23.880
be happy.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.400
I don't think they can do that.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.400
Probably not.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.400
Probably not.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.240
I want to point out in response to the last story, because there's a bit of a delay from

34:32.240 --> 34:37.880
when we say it to one of the live listeners here, ActDeft says, free is good, except for

34:37.880 --> 34:39.880
Yaris.

34:39.880 --> 34:43.600
Good point.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
Also

34:44.600 --> 34:45.760
You do pay in time, don't you?

34:45.760 --> 34:51.040
I have more rock band stuff, and this is not gonna be free, sadly, but this sounds like

34:51.040 --> 34:52.600
really cool.

34:52.600 --> 34:56.280
This came from an interview with the official Xbox magazine, and some more details have

34:56.280 --> 35:01.480
surfaced from Harmonix about rock band, and apparently, okay, you're gonna be able to

35:01.480 --> 35:04.240
take your band and export it to a webpage.

35:04.240 --> 35:10.000
And from there, you can take band avatars, pose your band avatars, make album covers

35:10.000 --> 35:13.840
with your band logo, make all these different scenes, and then you can turn that into real

35:13.840 --> 35:15.560
world stuff.

35:15.560 --> 35:19.720
You can make figurines based on these rock band characters, t-shirts that have the fake

35:19.720 --> 35:24.720
album art on them, and then tour dates that are just basically the accomplishments from

35:24.720 --> 35:25.720
the game.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.480
Oh, I want fucking figures.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.480
That would be awesome.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.480
I think that's awesome.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.480
That's a smart idiot.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.480
It's like Spore.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.880
It's like all that stuff you saw with Spore, like they were gonna let you do the printing

35:33.880 --> 35:34.880
or whatever.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.600
I think somebody saw that and thought that was a great idea.

35:37.600 --> 35:42.320
And you know, I think some of it's probably gonna be kind of junky, like, you know, some

35:42.320 --> 35:45.560
of the blogs have been saying, like, oh, this is basically gonna be, like, cafe e-press

35:45.560 --> 35:46.560
quality.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.200
True, but name me other games that do that.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.200
There's not a lot.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.200
Well, there is.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.200
It's still kind of neat.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.720
There is the Madden thing where you can buy a fucking ring for, like, $500.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.720
That's true.

35:56.720 --> 35:57.720
That's a little crazy.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.480
I'm excited to see how this plays out, because obviously it's not up there yet, but it must

36:01.480 --> 36:05.640
be coming soon, because the game is out on Tuesday.

36:05.640 --> 36:09.160
I will say, though, there are some pretty interesting, there are some of the load screens

36:09.160 --> 36:10.160
on there.

36:10.160 --> 36:14.800
They will have fake album art and stuff like that, and fake little, like, portraits and

36:14.800 --> 36:19.000
stuff with your characters that you design in it, like in different poses, which look

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
kind of neat.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.680
I thought the trivia was interesting.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.400
We played the Freeze Pop song, and it said something about Freeze Pop once got arrested

36:25.400 --> 36:28.320
in Canada and ate lots of poutine.

36:28.320 --> 36:32.000
And I was like, that's completely random.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.720
I'm like, wow.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.360
I'm like, do people outside of Canada even know what poutine is?

36:37.360 --> 36:38.360
I don't think so.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.360
We'll see.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.360
Anyway.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.360
I don't know what it is.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.360
It's basically french fries and gravy.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.680
That sounds really yummy.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.840
I have Canadian friends online that, like, blog about it.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.360
It's so good, apparently.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.360
I don't know.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.680
I know we've got Canadian listeners.

36:51.680 --> 36:55.600
I kind of do that with my leftover chips from the British food store.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.600
Alright.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
I get it.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.480
I put chip shop curry on it.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.240
Why is it this show always turns into the food show?

37:02.240 --> 37:03.240
Somebody asked me that.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
Because we're hungry.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.040
Did food and gaming go hand in hand like that?

37:06.040 --> 37:07.040
Yes.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.040
Alright.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.040
Anyhow.

37:09.040 --> 37:18.160
Well, for other stuff, Rob, for anyone who is familiar with Atlas USA, they are bringing

37:18.160 --> 37:24.800
out Spectro Force 3 and Operation Darkness for Xbox 360, which is pretty cool.

37:24.800 --> 37:31.440
Atlas gave us Trauma Center on Wii, so we are getting their new localizations.

37:31.440 --> 37:37.240
And they made the cute little tactical game with the voice acting on PS2.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.240
God damn it.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.620
Why can't I think of it?

37:39.620 --> 37:40.620
Really popular.

37:40.620 --> 37:41.620
Just got a sequel recently.

37:41.620 --> 37:42.620
Disgaea.

37:42.620 --> 37:43.620
Thank you, Disgaea.

37:43.620 --> 37:44.620
Disgaea.

37:44.620 --> 37:45.620
Yeah.

37:45.620 --> 37:46.620
And Persona.

37:46.620 --> 37:47.620
They made that too.

37:47.620 --> 37:48.620
They published it.

37:48.620 --> 37:49.620
So we're getting more.

37:49.620 --> 37:50.620
Oh, true.

37:50.620 --> 37:51.620
True.

37:51.620 --> 37:52.620
Yes.

37:52.620 --> 37:53.620
They're publishing.

37:53.620 --> 37:54.620
But yeah, we're getting more fun.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.620
The difference.

37:55.620 --> 37:56.620
My bad.

37:56.620 --> 38:00.320
But I was going to say that Operation Darkness looked like crap, by the way.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.040
It's like, I don't know, it looked dumb from what I remember when they were first showing

38:04.040 --> 38:06.120
video of that.

38:06.120 --> 38:14.080
Anywho, so Lionhead, you may remember them from the Fable series, well, they're looking

38:14.080 --> 38:18.120
for some custom insults for Fable 2.

38:18.120 --> 38:24.240
So they actually have a whole thing where you can submit your insults to them and apparently

38:24.240 --> 38:27.920
if they like it, they will put it in the game.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.980
So that's kind of neat.

38:31.980 --> 38:34.000
I have one.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.240
Your gameplay makes me want to go play a PlayStation 3.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.960
Is that good?

38:38.960 --> 38:39.960
No.

38:39.960 --> 38:47.160
Some of the ones that they were saying, or that were on there already, Groin Crab, Loner

38:47.160 --> 38:55.040
McLonelyton, and Big Girls Blouse, which I don't understand that.

38:55.040 --> 39:00.720
What do you think would happen if I submitted, so they're names to call people?

39:00.720 --> 39:05.880
You know, to be honest, all they need to do is monitor names and little catch phrases

39:05.880 --> 39:08.640
that are in Animal Crossing, because I mean that's what people do anyway.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.640
Oh, good point.

39:09.640 --> 39:20.160
I was going to say like, as a joke, if you're supposed to submit things that are like name

39:20.160 --> 39:25.240
calling or whatever, let's all submit Bobby Black Wolf as a name calling thing.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.040
Funny.

39:27.040 --> 39:31.480
Just kidding, Bobby, if you're listening, all right, moving on.

39:31.480 --> 39:35.440
One thing that they don't want you putting your opinions in and don't want you asking

39:35.440 --> 39:39.840
about anymore is Bioshock on the PlayStation 3.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.360
Damn it, Sony fanboys, 2K Games has given you the smackdown.

39:43.360 --> 39:45.440
It is not happening.

39:45.440 --> 39:50.800
It's an official response on the 2K forums, and this is what the moderator had to say.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.540
Quote, please don't tell me you made an account just for this question.

39:54.540 --> 39:57.720
There will be no PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock.

39:57.720 --> 40:01.360
It has been explained time and time again.

40:01.360 --> 40:07.160
So if you were hoping to save some, what do they call them, little sisters on the PlayStation

40:07.160 --> 40:08.480
3 version?

40:08.480 --> 40:09.480
Not going to happen.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
Sorry, kids.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.800
Bioshock 2?

40:11.800 --> 40:12.800
You never know.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.800
I mean, you know there's got to be a Bioshock 2 at some point.

40:14.800 --> 40:20.760
This game's getting amazing reviews, but Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3, well, if there's enough

40:20.760 --> 40:24.000
PlayStation 3s out there, they'll probably do it.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.100
So that's that.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.320
No Bioshock for you PlayStation 3 kids.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.920
But, but, but we like...

40:28.920 --> 40:29.920
No.

40:29.920 --> 40:30.920
Okay.

40:30.920 --> 40:36.320
Well, they are now putting out something very interesting for PlayStation 3.

40:36.320 --> 40:40.480
I think this is very interesting.

40:40.480 --> 40:49.160
Trend Micro Incorporated is putting out antivirus software for the PlayStation 3.

40:49.160 --> 40:53.620
I don't know if that's sort of interesting, but they're saying that the home systems now

40:53.620 --> 40:58.360
are going to be vulnerable to spyware and viruses for being able to go on the internet.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.720
Is that so my PlayStation 3 doesn't get herpes?

41:00.720 --> 41:01.720
I thought...

41:01.720 --> 41:06.680
I don't know if it's antivirus software, but I think Trend Micro is doing the parental

41:06.680 --> 41:11.040
controls on the internet browser that they're going to add...

41:11.040 --> 41:16.800
I think they've already added them with the last update, but it's basically just parental

41:16.800 --> 41:17.800
controls, I think.

41:17.800 --> 41:22.880
Yeah, it's to block the sites that are more notorious for providing the...

41:22.880 --> 41:24.480
No porno for you, kiddies.

41:24.480 --> 41:29.000
Well, they're saying that it's blocking malicious websites and also putting in the parental

41:29.000 --> 41:31.520
lock-out.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.440
I think that more parents should be locked out from their PlayStation 3.

41:34.440 --> 41:35.960
I'm kidding.

41:35.960 --> 41:36.960
Totally not serious.

41:36.960 --> 41:44.120
Well, I used my PlayStation 3 the other day, unfortunately, to watch License to Wed.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.120
What?

41:45.120 --> 41:46.120
Sad.

41:46.120 --> 41:49.580
Anyways, I got it for free.

41:49.580 --> 41:52.480
So yeah, there was actually something pretty cool, and this is a little bit of a positive

41:52.480 --> 41:54.040
spin on the PlayStation Eye now.

41:54.040 --> 41:57.920
I think the Eye of Judgment is a piece of crap, however, the PlayStation Eye not so

41:57.920 --> 41:59.640
bad because it's just a camera.

41:59.640 --> 42:05.780
But they had a video that was posted on the official Sony blog that was showing off some

42:05.780 --> 42:08.920
of their tech demos that they're making with the PlayStation Eye.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.760
Why the fuck they haven't done this stuff yet?

42:10.760 --> 42:12.640
Because it's actually pretty cool.

42:12.640 --> 42:19.120
A guy made a little Lunar Lander kind of game just by drawing something on a piece of paper,

42:19.120 --> 42:22.760
and the PlayStation Eye turned it into a game.

42:22.760 --> 42:28.440
They also had another one that looked kind of like combat on the Atari 2600, but it was

42:28.440 --> 42:31.800
done by scanning in tanks and stuff that you draw.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.880
So I thought all that stuff was pretty cool, and that they should implement that, or at

42:35.880 --> 42:39.360
least put it on their PlayStation Network.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.520
Something to do with the PlayStation Eye.

42:40.520 --> 42:41.800
I think it's good stuff.

42:41.800 --> 42:46.160
Hopefully they'll have something later on, like in, say, Little Big Planet, where you

42:46.160 --> 42:48.200
can draw things into the environment.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.360
That would be pretty awesome.

42:51.360 --> 42:56.160
You know, I think this is the problem with all these camera peripherals, peripherals

42:56.160 --> 43:01.500
in general, they come out for like one or two games, and then they're not continued

43:01.500 --> 43:04.320
to be supported, therefore the peripherals never sell.

43:04.320 --> 43:09.400
You have to make a ton of games for the peripherals in order for them to finally sell.

43:09.400 --> 43:16.120
Like for example here, the Xbox Vision camera.

43:16.120 --> 43:20.760
That is a piece of useless crap, and I'm sad to have made that mistake twice now with both

43:20.760 --> 43:27.080
the Eye toy and the vision camera.

43:27.080 --> 43:30.720
And that's why I haven't bought a PlayStation Eye yet, because I don't want to buy another

43:30.720 --> 43:32.920
useless camera.

43:32.920 --> 43:38.700
Exactly, like how many things can you use that stupid vision cam for?

43:38.700 --> 43:42.400
One to make your own icon on Xbox Live that only your friends can see.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
Yay, Totem Ball!

43:43.400 --> 43:44.400
That game was awesome!

43:44.400 --> 43:49.760
I'm not going to count Totem Ball, because that's something against the Xbox Live camera.

43:49.760 --> 43:53.480
And then there's Strip Uno.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.120
That's it.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.240
That's all the cam is good for.

43:56.240 --> 43:59.800
And they also have strip checkers, strip chests.

43:59.800 --> 44:03.580
And I guess you also have hardwood hearts or whatever, but who plays those games?

44:03.580 --> 44:04.580
Hardwood hearts.

44:04.580 --> 44:10.240
But seriously, did you play the Spyglass games or whatever it was called?

44:10.240 --> 44:11.240
It was kind of crap.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.480
It was kind of sloppy, I don't know.

44:13.480 --> 44:18.340
Just because a game supports the fucking camera, which to be honest, I think all of the games

44:18.340 --> 44:21.840
should support the damn camera.

44:21.840 --> 44:23.800
I don't know.

44:23.800 --> 44:26.560
Jason brings up a point, Texas Hold'em supports it now.

44:26.560 --> 44:27.560
I forgot about that.

44:27.560 --> 44:28.560
Oh, yay.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.720
That is true.

44:29.720 --> 44:32.600
I haven't played Texas Hold'em in a long time.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.640
Which is too bad, because I think we were invited to a tournament, and that reminds

44:35.640 --> 44:40.360
me, I need to reply to that email, because we're being stuck up by not replying.

44:40.360 --> 44:41.360
My bad.

44:41.360 --> 44:42.760
All right.

44:42.760 --> 44:43.960
But we really suck at Hold'em.

44:43.960 --> 44:44.960
Is anybody good at Hold'em?

44:44.960 --> 44:45.960
I was okay.

44:45.960 --> 44:46.960
Really?

44:46.960 --> 44:47.960
You should play for us then.

44:47.960 --> 44:48.960
Not that good.

44:48.960 --> 44:51.640
Well, I'm okay at it.

44:51.640 --> 44:52.640
We could all play.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.960
We could all go to the same place and play together.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.240
I have better things to play.

44:57.240 --> 45:02.840
I played Hold'em once with Bobby for maybe 20 minutes, and that was it.

45:02.840 --> 45:03.840
All right.

45:03.840 --> 45:07.520
Anyhow, very cool news for the PlayStation 3.

45:07.520 --> 45:08.800
Yes, that's right.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.360
Very cool news for the PlayStation 3.

45:10.360 --> 45:11.800
I'm completely serious here.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
What?

45:12.800 --> 45:13.800
Yeah, I know.

45:13.800 --> 45:15.800
Divx is going to be partnering with Sony.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.860
This is based on an announcement from Divx.

45:17.860 --> 45:23.640
They're going to be integrating its video playback technology into the PlayStation 3.

45:23.640 --> 45:29.440
If you update your development kits to 2.0, you can already utilize the Divx technology

45:29.440 --> 45:35.960
for your games, and hopefully, if Divx gets enabled in a future PlayStation 3 firmware

45:35.960 --> 45:40.120
upgrade, which at this point, who's to say why wouldn't it, then you can actually watch

45:40.120 --> 45:44.120
all the porn that you download over the internet and all the pirated movies.

45:44.120 --> 45:47.160
You'll be able to watch that over your local network.

45:47.160 --> 45:51.080
That would be totally useful for someone who pirates.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.200
Not too bad that I will not be using that.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.040
Yes, not that you should be pirating.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.040
That's wrong.

45:56.040 --> 45:57.040
That's wrong.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.840
R. And yeah, you should not be doing that.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.280
R. Well, if it's on the internet, it must be okay to download, right?

46:03.280 --> 46:06.640
I mean, they wouldn't put something illegal on the internet, would they?

46:06.640 --> 46:08.720
No, of course not.

46:08.720 --> 46:11.600
That's just completely...

46:11.600 --> 46:17.480
Someone from OL Army Ninja in chat says, did OLR really just go two whole stories about

46:17.480 --> 46:20.080
Sony and not bad talk them?

46:20.080 --> 46:24.720
We said a long time ago, when Sony does something right, we will give them credit for it.

46:24.720 --> 46:25.720
Hey, we're...

46:25.720 --> 46:27.080
And then we'll make fun of them for everything else.

46:27.080 --> 46:30.080
I'm equally offensive against all consoles.

46:30.080 --> 46:37.440
For example, this week's live edition, fucking Shrek Enroll and Screwjumper, what the fuck

46:37.440 --> 46:39.160
is that shit?

46:39.160 --> 46:45.000
Shrek Enroll, first of all, Shrek should never be on the fucking Xbox Live Arcade ever, and

46:45.000 --> 46:46.440
obviously this game sucks.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.200
You know it was to make it more family friendly.

46:48.200 --> 46:49.200
That was the point.

46:49.200 --> 46:54.200
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, was that really your response to that?

46:54.200 --> 46:55.200
Yeah.

46:55.200 --> 46:59.040
I'll tell you what, THQ needs to make better games then.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.000
That's what needs to happen.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.320
Stop fucking licensing shit and making crap, because that's what's going to happen when

47:05.320 --> 47:08.240
you license shit and get crap.

47:08.240 --> 47:09.880
I would also mean it's not crap.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.200
How about it?

47:11.200 --> 47:14.040
Orange Box, which is not crap.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.480
It is not crap.

47:15.480 --> 47:19.600
It's going to be on PS3 in December for our European fans.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.600
Pretty cool.

47:20.600 --> 47:24.040
You will see it on the 14th of December, to be specific.

47:24.040 --> 47:28.360
It will not be 2008, like the rumors are said, you are going to see it this year.

47:28.360 --> 47:29.360
Great.

47:29.360 --> 47:33.760
And I believe it's on the 12th in the US as well.

47:33.760 --> 47:36.680
But Portal, Portal...

47:36.680 --> 47:39.080
That is no lie, unlike the cake.

47:39.080 --> 47:40.080
Portal.

47:40.080 --> 47:42.600
Yeah, are you saying just buy this game for Portal and the hell with everything else?

47:42.600 --> 47:44.760
Just buy it for Portal, the hell with everything else.

47:44.760 --> 47:49.360
Although, I did find a very interesting thing, because I was reading some of the forums about

47:49.360 --> 47:53.040
it, because people are trying to piece in where Portal is supposed to fit in the Half-Life

47:53.040 --> 47:58.120
story, which I thought was really cool speculation, because I love speculating about storylines

47:58.120 --> 47:59.120
and things.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.120
Well, hold on.

48:00.120 --> 48:01.120
Are you telling me there's Portal fanfic?

48:01.120 --> 48:02.120
No.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.120
It actually does fanfic.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.440
There is.

48:04.440 --> 48:06.440
And there's weighted companion cube fan art.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.440
Yeah.

48:07.440 --> 48:11.080
As long as there's not weighted companion cube slash, then we're okay.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.080
No.

48:12.080 --> 48:18.520
No, but I was reading just how they were speculating how it fitted in, and someone was saying that

48:18.520 --> 48:25.200
there's a way that you can import the Half-Life 2 maps into Portal, and you can use the Portal

48:25.200 --> 48:26.440
gun in Half-Life 2.

48:26.440 --> 48:27.680
I think it's the other way around.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.680
You import...

48:28.680 --> 48:32.600
No, it was saying specifically that they moved the maps to the Portal folder.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.560
It was using some program or something.

48:34.560 --> 48:40.620
I think it's the other way around, they imported the Portal gun into Half-Life 2, but yeah,

48:40.620 --> 48:41.620
you can do that.

48:41.620 --> 48:47.560
Anyways, I was going to say there is, if you notice in the game, actually there's a few

48:47.560 --> 48:52.720
times where you can see through the window, and there's a little slide projector.

48:52.720 --> 48:57.960
They're showing Aperture Science versus, I don't remember what the other corporation

48:57.960 --> 49:04.040
is in Half-Life 2, so forgive me there, but a whole little thing about that, I guess they're

49:04.040 --> 49:08.840
making competing technologies and stuff, and it's even in the song too.

49:08.840 --> 49:12.680
They're talking about that whole thing.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.360
Why are people in the chat saying Rule 34 and laughing?

49:15.360 --> 49:19.840
Is that a Portal joke that I don't get?

49:19.840 --> 49:22.480
I don't know.

49:22.480 --> 49:25.160
I still haven't played it.

49:25.160 --> 49:26.920
Maybe I'll download it on Steam this week.

49:26.920 --> 49:27.920
We'll see.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.360
I can't tear myself away from the MMOs long enough.

49:29.360 --> 49:32.880
Forgive me.

49:32.880 --> 49:34.720
This is Creed, it's quite interesting.

49:34.720 --> 49:40.720
There's been reports coming out now that the PlayStation 3 version, let's see here, oh

49:40.720 --> 49:45.760
I'm sorry that's your story, never mind, PlayStation Store updates, yes.

49:45.760 --> 49:49.960
Lots of cool stuff for the PlayStation Store this week, including actually one that I was

49:49.960 --> 49:53.880
kind of looking at, although I played something very similar to it, I want to say it was actually

49:53.880 --> 49:59.120
on the PlayStation Network, Toy Home, it's a little car racing game, kind of like Micro

49:59.120 --> 50:02.040
Machines or something like that, you can play that.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.800
High Velocity Bowling, they have a trailer for that.

50:05.800 --> 50:09.560
There is a demo now for Uncharted Drake's Fortune, so that's worth checking out, I actually

50:09.560 --> 50:14.840
got some good reviews, and then of course trailers for Ratchet and Clank Future, and

50:14.840 --> 50:21.500
Time Shift, and Time Crisis 4, oh and Battlefield, Bad Company, and Burnout Paradise.

50:21.500 --> 50:31.600
Let's see here, then other than that, there's also a demo for Blazing Angels 2, okay I guess,

50:31.600 --> 50:38.960
and then finally, un-game related videos, including The Dark Knight, which is just the

50:38.960 --> 50:47.360
teaser trailer, and This Christmas, and Remember That Night.

50:47.360 --> 50:51.200
The Dark Knight teaser trailer kind of sucks, I don't know if you've seen it, there's nothing

50:51.200 --> 50:57.160
to it, that's the problem, I am so freaking ready for this movie, I can't wait to freaking

50:57.160 --> 51:02.080
see it, it looks so awesome, but that trailer sucked, it didn't tell you anything, I had

51:02.080 --> 51:06.720
some crappy voiceovers and a spinning card, whoopee doo, oh how would you download that?

51:06.720 --> 51:13.640
There's also some Uncharted wallpapers, but no themes yet, so, hooray.

51:13.640 --> 51:19.060
Anyhow, you might want to watch out for this though, or maybe you won't get to access that

51:19.060 --> 51:25.100
PlayStation store, and that is the brand newly discovered White Screen of Death on the PlayStation

51:25.100 --> 51:33.840
3, and the cause, Assassin's Creed, apparently some folks who are using firmware 2.0 are

51:33.840 --> 51:39.000
getting the White Screen of Death while playing Assassin's Creed, this is coming up on posts

51:39.000 --> 51:46.040
on the Ubisoft forums, and apparently there's a lot of folks that are posting about these

51:46.040 --> 51:54.080
freezing issues and bug glitch issues, so there you have it, no real answer as to what

51:54.080 --> 51:58.760
exactly causes this, it seems to be somewhat random, but they're saying it also has some

51:58.760 --> 52:04.560
frame rate problems, screen tearing, geometry clipping, and lockups.

52:04.560 --> 52:10.080
The game actually had a worse frame rate slightly than the Xbox 360 version, and there's also

52:10.080 --> 52:13.720
some videos online of some pretty weird glitches in the game, like one where you fall through

52:13.720 --> 52:19.960
the earth, there's another one where your character kind of clones himself, and so you're

52:19.960 --> 52:22.320
controlling two copies of your character.

52:22.320 --> 52:26.600
Now someone on my friends list played both, and actually said the PlayStation 3 is a little

52:26.600 --> 52:35.000
better, so maybe if these issues don't come to haunt you, then you're fine, it doesn't

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
matter.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.720
I was going to say also that the game ain't that good, that's another thing.

52:41.720 --> 52:42.720
You didn't like it really?

52:42.720 --> 52:43.720
No.

52:43.720 --> 52:44.720
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

52:44.720 --> 52:45.720
I've played a little bit of it.

52:45.720 --> 52:48.400
I haven't played it yet, but a lot of people are really liking it.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.400
What else was I going to say about that?

52:50.400 --> 52:51.920
What is it you don't like about it?

52:51.920 --> 52:52.920
It's boring.

52:52.920 --> 52:53.920
Really?

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
It really is.

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
It's not as...

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
You're going to kill people.

52:56.920 --> 52:58.720
Okay, well that's like any game.

52:58.720 --> 53:02.660
So I don't know, I just didn't care for it.

53:02.660 --> 53:05.360
I didn't see what the fuss was about.

53:05.360 --> 53:06.360
Alright.

53:06.360 --> 53:13.840
Well, there was a rumor circulating around that Capcom was thinking about putting a Resident

53:13.840 --> 53:21.060
Evil 5 demo on the Blu-Ray for Resident Evil Extinction, and also another one saying that

53:21.060 --> 53:25.760
Devil May Cry 4 would have a demo on there, but Capcom said, uh-uh, they're just putting

53:25.760 --> 53:27.760
trailers up.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.040
That would have been so cool, though.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.040
I know.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.960
I think there's a lot of people very excited about Resident Evil 5.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.080
Capcom should do it.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.080
The demo is a lie.

53:37.080 --> 53:43.520
They should put a really crappy demo for something, just have a stick figure with a head.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.680
They should put Doom on there.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.120
Yet another bastardization of Mega Man.

53:47.120 --> 53:53.960
No, they should do Resident Evil with Doom graphics, with all pixel.

53:53.960 --> 53:54.960
I like this.

53:54.960 --> 53:59.220
Odd1InChat says, God, I need that Resident Evil 5 demo.

53:59.220 --> 54:04.440
Notice how it's not like, I want, I wish they would put it out there, he says, I need it.

54:04.440 --> 54:07.080
I need it now.

54:07.080 --> 54:10.800
I need Animal Crossing Wii, but I'm just going to have to wait a little longer.

54:10.800 --> 54:11.800
Life sucks.

54:11.800 --> 54:12.800
Wait.

54:12.800 --> 54:17.280
Well, what is it, Dennis Leary says, life sucks, wear a helmet.

54:17.280 --> 54:20.280
Life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.280
That's all I know.

54:21.280 --> 54:24.300
Anyways, well, there's a few games, though, that you're not going to have to wait much

54:24.300 --> 54:27.860
longer to play, and that's the stuff coming out this week.

54:27.860 --> 54:32.260
So in the US, starting off here- Dear God Friday.

54:32.260 --> 54:35.260
I know, oh my God, the release dates for Japan are here.

54:35.260 --> 54:38.480
Everybody, give sympathy to our- Everybody, get a book, get a pillow, we're

54:38.480 --> 54:41.240
going to have a long segment for release dates.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.960
Everybody feel sorry for our retail workers this Friday.

54:43.960 --> 54:47.360
No, that's not going to be a long segment, actually, there's not a lot coming out this

54:47.360 --> 54:48.360
week.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.360
Oh my God.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.360
The Japanese ones is huge.

54:50.360 --> 54:53.800
Anyways, I was just going to mention, I think this came out last week already, and I have

54:53.800 --> 54:56.360
a kind of a last minute story about it later on.

54:56.360 --> 55:01.600
Avatar, the Burning Earth, now the new record holder for the fastest way to get achievements

55:01.600 --> 55:02.600
on Xbox 360.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.600
Hooray.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.720
So that's coming out now.

55:05.720 --> 55:09.440
Baby Pals on the DS, yes, it's another fucking baby raising sim.

55:09.440 --> 55:12.440
Wait, did you say baby raising?

55:12.440 --> 55:13.440
Or baby racing?

55:13.440 --> 55:14.440
Raising.

55:14.440 --> 55:15.440
Dude, they should tell me baby racing.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.440
Oh my God, a baby racing game?

55:16.440 --> 55:17.440
That would be awesome.

55:17.440 --> 55:21.320
A baby racing game would be hardcore, I'd buy that shit.

55:21.320 --> 55:24.200
Developers, are you listening?

55:24.200 --> 55:25.200
Baby racing.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.960
More babies.

55:26.960 --> 55:28.440
Babies versus kittens.

55:28.440 --> 55:30.680
Who will win?

55:30.680 --> 55:35.760
Anyways, Cabela's Monster Bass, it's a bass fishing game on the PlayStation 2.

55:35.760 --> 55:41.640
College Hoops 2K8 is coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360 this week.

55:41.640 --> 55:49.880
CSI Dark Motives, CSI game on the DS, apparently a venture game, kind of crappy.

55:49.880 --> 55:54.440
The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific, another piece of shovelware on PlayStation

55:54.440 --> 55:55.680
2, PlayStation 3.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.240
Did you call that shovelware?

55:57.240 --> 55:58.240
Yeah.

55:58.240 --> 55:59.240
What does that mean?

55:59.240 --> 56:00.240
It means it's crap.

56:00.240 --> 56:01.240
Oh.

56:01.240 --> 56:02.240
Anyways.

56:02.240 --> 56:08.480
No, actually, it's on PlayStation 2 this week because the other games got delayed.

56:08.480 --> 56:14.400
Imagine Fashion Designer on the PC, yes, you too can design crap.

56:14.400 --> 56:18.760
Mario Party DS, that's going to be a good game, so pick that one up.

56:18.760 --> 56:23.560
Medal of Honor Airborne for the PlayStation 3, I guess better late than never.

56:23.560 --> 56:27.040
Monster Jam on the Wii, same there.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.040
Let's see.

56:28.040 --> 56:32.800
Genesis 4, which is including the GunCon, that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation

56:32.800 --> 56:36.360
3, so it might be worth picking up if you like gun games.

56:36.360 --> 56:40.540
Unreal Tournament 3, coming out on PC, so that should be pretty awesome.

56:40.540 --> 56:43.840
No word on the PlayStation 3 version yet.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.760
Let's see.

56:45.760 --> 56:51.400
World of Warcraft, March of the Legion, the card game, I don't know if anyone's interested

56:51.400 --> 56:54.560
in the World of Warcraft card game.

56:54.560 --> 57:01.780
Let's see here, Soldier of Fortune Payback on the PlayStation 3 actually got delayed

57:01.780 --> 57:05.320
to this week, which I thought was kind of interesting.

57:05.320 --> 57:10.780
AMF Bowling Pin Busters on the Wii, I don't know if this is a good game or not, but it's

57:10.780 --> 57:17.220
only 20 bucks, so if you like bowling and you're a little tired of Wii Sports bowling,

57:17.220 --> 57:19.320
might want to check that out.

57:19.320 --> 57:25.640
And then finally, Final Fantasy Online, they have the Vanadil Collection 2008 on PlayStation

57:25.640 --> 57:30.880
2 and Xbox 360, which is going to include, of course, all the previous expansions, the

57:30.880 --> 57:35.600
original game, and of course, the other thing that's coming out this week, the Final Fantasy

57:35.600 --> 57:41.200
11 Online Wings of the Goddess expansion, which should make some people happy.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.200
Yay!

57:43.200 --> 57:44.200
Let's see then.

57:44.200 --> 57:47.200
Oh, and that's also coming out on PC as well.

57:47.200 --> 57:53.800
Then on the DS, John Deere Harvest in the Heartland.

57:53.800 --> 57:57.920
It's a farming sim for real.

57:57.920 --> 58:00.360
Take that, Harvest Moon.

58:00.360 --> 58:07.520
Luxor Pharaoh's Challenge on PlayStation 2, that'll probably suck.

58:07.520 --> 58:10.640
Ghost Squad on the Wii, which I highly recommend you pick up.

58:10.640 --> 58:16.140
That's only $29.99, so definitely a great gun game for the Wii, and also uses the Wii

58:16.140 --> 58:19.080
Zapper, which is also coming out this week.

58:19.080 --> 58:22.560
Soul Calibur Legends, which I heard sucked, has come out on the Wii.

58:22.560 --> 58:28.600
Rock Band, of course, probably the biggest game this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

58:28.600 --> 58:31.720
both the special edition and the game only.

58:31.720 --> 58:35.280
And then Showtime Boxing on the Wii also sucked.

58:35.280 --> 58:40.200
Star Trek Conquest on PlayStation 2 also sucked.

58:40.200 --> 58:45.880
Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake, probably also sucks.

58:45.880 --> 58:50.600
Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, that game's pretty good on the DS.

58:50.600 --> 59:01.940
Godzilla Unleashed also sucked, and I believe that is it.

59:01.940 --> 59:05.520
And you said there's not a lot coming out this week, come on, that took like five minutes.

59:05.520 --> 59:07.560
That's because I'm slow.

59:07.560 --> 59:13.480
Coming out over on the Japanese shores, Final Fantasy XI Wings of the Goddess comes out

59:13.480 --> 59:16.840
for Xbox 360 this week on November 22nd.

59:16.840 --> 59:19.560
I think it has a different name in Japan, though.

59:19.560 --> 59:23.960
We're calling it Wings of the Goddess over here, but I want to say it's called Altana's

59:23.960 --> 59:26.320
Heroes or something like that over there, I can't remember.

59:26.320 --> 59:30.040
Anyhow, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally makes its way to the Xbox

59:30.040 --> 59:32.560
360 as well this week in Japan.

59:32.560 --> 59:37.840
Also coming out, Medal of Honor Airborne, also for the 360, and another 360 game, and

59:37.840 --> 59:40.120
you didn't think there was anything for the 360 in Japan.

59:40.120 --> 59:44.340
Winning XI 2008 makes its way to Japan.

59:44.340 --> 59:49.160
Coming to the Wii this week in Japan, Dragon Blade comes out.

59:49.160 --> 59:55.560
This is from D3, is publishing this, and yep, looks like another role-playing game.

59:55.560 --> 59:59.720
It's an action game like God of War, it's a rip-off of God of War, but it's not even

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.760
close to being as good as God of War.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.960
Interesting because from the box art and everything, it looks like your typical RPG, but there

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.960
you have it.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.960
My own Sonic at the Olympics makes its way to Japan, also on the Wii this week, the 22nd.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.240
Coming out on PlayStation 3, another version of Harry Potter, because of course those games

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.040
come out on every console.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:23.760
Also Remi no Oishi Restaurant, which you know better on these shores as Ratatouille, that

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.160
movie Ratatouille, whatever, how do you say that, I don't even know.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:34.480
PlayStation 2 gets a reduction in price on all of the Fatal Frame games this week, so

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.440
if you miss the Fatal Frame series, now's your chance.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.000
Also coming out, another version of Wings of the Goddess for Final Fantasy XI hits the

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.920
PlayStation 2 as well, because they say in Japan most players are on the PS2, because

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.280
that's where the game came out first.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:56.120
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Pre-Saga, Princess Osagasi, that's coming out from Able,

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:02.220
and it's an adventure game involving princesses, hooray!

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:08.440
Also coming out, Umisho, the limited edition, an adventure game coming out as well, I'm

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.440
trying to see if we have any, no, but it looks like it's based around the swimming team,

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.980
is this an anime I don't know about, probably, probably.

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:21.800
Also coming out on the DS, Dragon Quest IV, this isn't the new one, but this is a remake

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.860
of the old school Dragon Quest IV, so check that out on the DS, and yes, it looks like

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:30.900
it takes full advantage of the dual screen capabilities, for instance when you're battling

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.380
your party status shows on the top screen, and the monsters that you're fighting and

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.680
all the different commands show up on the bottom screen.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:41.740
If you were hoping to import that one, I hope you read Japanese fluently, because there's

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.120
no Engrish in it.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:52.340
Also coming out on the DS, Uno Ikusi, IQ Breeder is coming out, and it looks like something

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:58.440
between a dog sim and a brain training game, so that's great, take your two biggest DS

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.200
games, cram them together, and you have this game, lovely, maybe it's where you beat the

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:11.660
dog until it's smart, I somehow doubt that, aww, alright, there it is, your Japanese releases.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:17.940
Puppies, okay, well there's a crap load of stuff coming out in the UK, on the 22nd we

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:27.140
have Final Fantasy XI, Wings of the Goddess, yay, Smarty Pants on Wii, 23rd Ace Combat

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.740
6, Fires of Liberation, which actually is not all that great, I will just tell you that

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:39.020
from experience, Beowulf, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II, Code Lyoko,

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:45.580
I guess, CSI Crime Scene Investigation, Hard Evidence, Dewey's Adventure, Ferrari Challenge

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:51.060
on Wii and DS, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock on a bunch of stuff, Jackass the Game, Juice

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:57.540
2, Hot Import Nights, Kane and Lynch, Deadman, Lair, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games,

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:03.660
Mass Effect, Medal of Honor, Heroes 2, My Horse and Me, I just think that's a funny

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:15.860
name, oh, how can I forget Mass Effect, Boo Loki, Boo You, whatever, NBA 2K8, Need for

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:23.740
Speed Pro Street, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance, Siphon Filter,

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:30.820
Logan's Shadow, Time Crisis 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Warhammer 40K, Squad Command, I hate Warhammer.

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.540
Oh, we got some stories in there you'll like later.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:35.540
Is that it?

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.540
Yeah.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.540
Wow.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.620
You just threw that mic down at the mere mention of Warhammer.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.140
The fuck is Warhammer shit?

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:44.140
Okay, it's the case it goes.

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:47.460
Bad memories of Warhammer.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.460
Do share.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:52.940
I dated a guy who was a Warhammer player and all he did was play Warhammer.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:58.220
Replace Warhammer with World of Warcraft and you have a lot of relationships in this day

01:03:58.220 --> 01:03:59.220
and age.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.900
He would spend hours painting his stupid little models and where the stupid little models

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.820
were kind of cool, I was like, dude, you are too obsessed with this shit.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:12.820
I got too bored with painting the models so I just, you know.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:17.380
The models suck, they're like a few millimeters tall, I was like, fuck, I can't paint this

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.380
shit.

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:25.700
My dog ended up eating a lot of them anyways, so, wow, but they were cool, yeah, for a while.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.780
Anyways, one thing that's also cool, although it's a little late for it about now, is a

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.020
new Terminator game.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.140
Yeah, Halcon is adapting Terminator for a brand new game, hopefully it's not based off

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:41.980
the new Terminator series, which I'm sure is going to blow, but I'm sure tons, I was

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:46.620
just going to say this Terminator thing comes just in time for the Sarah Connor Chronicles,

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:50.420
which I'm sure tons of people will be watching this winter on FOX during the writer's strike.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:56.140
Yes, Sarah Connor Chronicles, it's like, yeah, it's going to be a Terminator movie without

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.140
the Terminator.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:02.140
Oh, but there's a chick who's a Terminator also, and she's, it's like, seriously.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.600
But the chick Terminator was in Firefly and therefore it does have a couple points of

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.060
win attached.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:14.500
It's fucking emo shit, just like goddamn, was it Smallville or something like that,

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:19.260
where they just, oh, there's Terminators coming after me, it's like, seriously, they're just

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:22.580
going to keep coming after you until you die, so get used to it.

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:28.060
It also has the, you better not make my character gay kid from Heroes in it, who was then written

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.060
out of the show.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:30.060
Remember that?

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.980
The management was like, found the scripts where he was supposed to be gay and then like,

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.660
no, you need to write that he's in love with the cheerleader, and then he was in the show.

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:40.540
Why don't the Terminators go back in time, like way back in time, to like the Civil War

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:45.240
era and kill like their great, great, great, great grandparents or something like that,

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.240
you know?

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.940
Pick a fight with something, fuck, they can't even kill someone back in like the 80s and

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.860
shit with their superior technology.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:53.860
Lame.

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:59.860
Anyways, so yeah, they're developing a game, it's going to be a Terminator game, and no

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:04.860
word on what the hell it is, but it's not going to come out until mid-2009, it's also

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:11.840
I guess based on their upcoming film, Terminator Salvation, the future begins, lame!

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.220
But that's going to be coming out later.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:17.780
I love this comment from Odd1 in our chat room, who's making a lot of win comments tonight,

01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:18.780
good job.

01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:22.340
Odd1 says, Terminator without the Terminator, great.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:29.980
Next up, Star Wars without lightsabers, and Doctor Who based in South Central LA.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:36.700
There you have it, Doctor Who-ed, Doctor Who-ed.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.700
That's not funny.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:39.720
Yes it is, you're smiling.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:43.180
By the way, did you know I have to play Doctor Who this weekend at the show?

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.020
I need to go out and buy some Converse this weekend.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:49.020
It kept going back and forth, I was going to be Professor X, not Doctor Who.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.700
Go to Payless and get air walks, they're more comfortable.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:53.700
We'll see.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:07:02.380
Anyhow, I just think the Terminator comment's great.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.220
I know why they announced that they're making a new Terminator game to build off the hype

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:11.260
of other announcements out there, but I mean, how can you get excited about a game that's

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.740
going to come out for two years about the Terminator, unless fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.900
is going to be back into it, which he's not because he's in the fucking political game

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:19.900
now.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.780
I don't know.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.780
I just can't get all excited.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:27.820
I mean, seriously, what good Terminator games have there been out there, excluding the Terminator

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:33.180
the Arcade game, which was Terminator 2 the Arcade game, which was okay as a gun game,

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.900
but really it wasn't that great.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:41.140
Alright, well maybe the Terminator 4 game will make its way to GameTap in the near future,

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.980
because that's probably the only way I'll actually pay to play it.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:49.060
GameTap, by the way, passed a huge milestone this week, one thousand games now available

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.260
on the service.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.320
What was the one thousandth game?

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.900
A big one, one that I need to go play right now.

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.960
I need to stop the show right now and go play this game.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.980
Civilization 4 was the one thousandth game, which is, you know, if you've listened to

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:05.540
this game for any length of time, you know I have a lot of love for the very first Civilization

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.540
game, and the others that have come out since then have kind of turned me off, and for that

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.500
I never touched Civ 4, but I need to go give it a try now, because I have been playing

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.500
GameTap.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.580
I definitely want to go check that out.

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.820
The other ones are just too complicated.

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.660
I liked my Civ Simple, which Civ 1 was.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:25.020
So anyhow, for the record, when the service started, there were only 300 games available

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.020
on it.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.840
Now there are a thousand.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.980
So on GameTap.com is the information on all the games that are on the service, plus this

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:36.620
interesting little, you know, picture.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.920
You know those big pictures that are made up of little pictures?

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:40.920
They have one of those.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920
A mosaic?

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.920
Thank you, a mosaic.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.720
The word escaped me.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.220
They have that, but you can do a mouseover on all the little box arts and see what games

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:50.220
they are.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.940
Yay, box art!

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:57.420
That's exactly what I said, yay box art.

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:02.220
All right, anyhow, we are winding down part A of our show tonight, but we can't finish

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:06.100
up until we have Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:10.420
Yes, it's a way to pay homage to our elders, and from what I understand, because Dark Sakura

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.900
is leaving us for a couple weeks, she had to really pick a doozy to leave us with.

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:21.740
So here it is, Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:27.580
For the Classic Game of the Week, I have picked my favorite ever game, which everybody knows

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.420
me knows what my favorite game is, I picked The Guardian Legend.

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.900
When?

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.900
The Guardian Legend.

01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:37.480
I'll bring up some gameplay clips right now.

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:45.940
So The Guardian Legend is basically a game where you fly into, you know, the planet's

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:52.780
name is Naju, N-A-J-U, and it starts off as a shooter, and then it's like an adventure

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:54.580
RPG sort of thing.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:10:01.160
And you talk to these little guys called Blue Landers, who look a lot like Lolo, and it's

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.380
basically as you're going through it, you know, you have to pick up your power-ups,

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:11.740
you actually, as your score goes up, you earn, you know, different other power-ups and more

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:17.900
chips, is how your life is, is how your power-ups are stored, and then you earn more life too

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.340
as you go through the game until you're like the super-powered badass.

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:28.020
And there were a couple of neat glitches in the game, one of them where if you had a barrier

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.620
up the middle, if you held diagonally, you could actually sort of walk through the barrier,

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.380
which was my favorite trick to use also.

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:40.100
You also had, well this is in the glitch, but you had TGL mode, where it had this insane

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.380
password system, it was just crazy.

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.620
And although one time I actually put in one randomly and it took me to the end of the

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:55.580
game, so that was kind of cool, but you put in TGL, all in caps, and you play through

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:59.640
the entire game as a shooter, it gives you your power-ups in between, but it's very challenging

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640
to do that.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.900
It's really a challenge.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.940
And I'm glad you didn't use this one video file that I linked you to, because that person

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:08.140
could not play the first level for shit.

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.140
No.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.660
I did my own searching around YouTube to find this clip, it's a little better.

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:16.340
So here's some overworld music, and then I'm going to switch to Jamie's favorite song in

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.340
the game.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.340
Yeah.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.340
I'll tell you a little bit of it.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:26.140
The one cool thing about this is, for anyone who doesn't know too much about it, the original

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:32.740
game was actually on the MSX called Gardick, and this is actually the sequel to that Gardick

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:38.500
Gaiden, which was what it was called in Japan.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:44.740
It's also put out by Compile that gave us a bunch of really, really cool games.

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:49.860
Actually another one of my favorite shooters was Robo-Eleste, which is, you know, they

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.300
just did a whole crap ton of shooters.

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:57.460
This is somebody shooting the gun repeatedly to open the corridor, because every corridor

01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.540
had its own little trick to open it.

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.680
Let me actually switch, I'm going to switch to the music that Jamie says is her favorite

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.180
in the game, which is the music to Corridor Number 6.

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.180
Here's the overworld music after that.

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.180
Oh, it's the overworld music after this.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.180
The overworld music, yeah.

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:13.980
Oh, this music's good, too.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.100
I like this one, too, but the overworld music was my favorite.

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.920
Let me go ahead, I'll skip ahead a little bit in the video.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:19.920
Not that one.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.920
Oh, damn it.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.920
It was right before that.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920
It was right before this?

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.900
I think it's right after here.

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.140
That's the destruction of Corridor 15.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.940
Sadly, this game is not on a virtual console, I'm sad to say.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:36.140
It needs to be.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.100
This game is freaking great.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.380
I love this game.

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:40.380
I mean, there's no...

01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:42.380
This is the music I like.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:53.140
Oh, I remember this one.

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.660
You know, I love this game.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:55.660
There's no easy way to say it.

01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:57.060
I don't know what it is about this game.

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.300
I think it's the fact that it's a little bit of everything, which for the ADD gamer like

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:08.500
me is wonderful, and I don't know what we have to do to get a sequel to this game that

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500
doesn't suck.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:14.220
I realize there might be licensing issues and who owns the works and such and such,

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.980
but my God, I beg you, if you're out there and you have the power to make a sequel to

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.180
this game happen, that doesn't suck.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.900
It would technically be the third trilogy, then.

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:27.100
I guess that's true, because you do count Gartic, but Gartic, it's not nearly as memorable

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.100
as this game.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.780
If you've seen Gartic, it's not that exciting.

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.300
This really took it to a whole new level.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:37.500
Well, there is actually another glitch in the game, and I had actually remembered this

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.860
because I had a glitched copy, my very first one was.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:46.100
If you got your score to 10 million points, the game would crash and you couldn't play

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.100
any more.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.100
Oh.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:53.740
So the later releases would only let you go up to a maximum score of 9,999,990, because

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:57.320
the points were all multiples of 10.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.380
And for anyone who's a big fan of the compiled games, the Blue Landers, actually one of their

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:05.100
mascots, was also in the Sega Master System game called Glovellius.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.100
Nice.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.060
So there you go.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:13.420
Yes, it was not made by Square, Chatroom, this is compiled, published by Broderbund

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:14.420
here in the US.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.420
Yep.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.420
So there you have it.

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:20.180
And because none of those companies exist anymore, that's why it's sadly unlikely we're

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:24.540
going to see this, but possibly this game could make its way to Virtual Console, only

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:28.860
based on the fact that Lode Runner was also a Broderbund game, and that did come out on

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.580
Virtual Console for TurboGrafx.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.860
So you never know, nothing is impossible, I suppose.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:39.500
But this is one of my, not only does Jamie love this game, I do too, I don't know how

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.860
Loki feels about it, but he better like it, or he's fired.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.660
So there you go.

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:48.460
Classic game of the week, Guardian Legend.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.460
Well done.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:54.220
Alright, well with that, we are going to wrap up Part A of tonight's show, and we'll be

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:59.300
back in a little bit with Part B of Orange Lounge Radio, just in time for Thanksgiving

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.340
for those folks listening on the podcast.

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:05.860
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.860
a week.

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:33.420
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
