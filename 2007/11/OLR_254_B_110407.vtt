Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
We're live here on Sunday evening taping and some housekeeping items I've neglected to mention.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
In part A of tonight's show.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
I actually did a guest stint on another show this week so you should check that out.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
It's called Ultimate Quest is the show.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
And you've probably heard Footy Monster, maybe Xenocore call in this show.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Well they are hosts on another show over at All Games and it's called Ultimate Quest.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
And that show should be out this week.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I think they said Monday night or Tuesday afternoon-ish so check them out at UltimateQuest.net.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
We had a conversation about MMOs.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
And you know I was kind of like the guy there that played WoW and Final Fantasy XI.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
But it was a good panel because they had another guy that was like City of Heroes and a couple were playing Eve Online.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
And you know lots of different MMOs being talked about.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
We were kind of talking about societies and getting into a pretty in-depth discussion.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Good times, I approve.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So thanks to the kids at Ultimate Quest for having me on their program.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Now we can get back into some gaming news.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Alright, so Super Mario Galaxy of course is coming out not next week but the week after next.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
And you know it's been revealed that there's going to be a certain hidden playable character in the game.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
Apparently when you secure all 120 stars in the game, complete all the purple coin missions,

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
defeated Bowser a second time, you can play as Luigi.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
And actually Luigi, he will jump higher and further, also runs faster but has trouble stopping.

01:49.000 --> 01:56.000
And says otherwise they have the same moves but it actually makes the game a little bit harder.

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
That's kind of cool. That's just like Luigi in the Lost Levels or Super Mario Bros. 2 Japanese, however you want to call it.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Luigi jumped higher but he was harder to control.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
He was like constantly on ice basically. Luigi on ice.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Luigi needs no sneakers.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Not just a palette swap.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
At least it's not, you know, Luigi's Mansion.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah that would be, I'm glad it's not Luigi's Mansion embedded in the game.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Although I don't know, part of me thinks Luigi's Mansion got a bad rap. I don't know.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
I actually liked Luigi's Mansion until it got to the baby part and then the baby part kind of creeped me out.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Really? Well I thought you liked scary video games though.

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
There's a difference between stupid scary and like, I like Silent Hill and I like Resident Evil.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Mental screwing with your mind scary.

02:41.000 --> 02:49.000
Well thanks to the ESRB ratings some new games have been leaked for upcoming US Virtual Console releases.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Alien Soldier is one of the games that is going to be coming to Virtual Console soon.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
As well as Shining Force 2 and Bubble Bobble will be coming to Virtual Console.

02:59.000 --> 03:07.000
And it is assumed that they have worked it out so that you can get past level 30 in the Virtual Console release of Bubble Bobble.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
That's kind of a dated joke now. I wonder if people get that.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
And apparently some late breaking news because we do tape live on Sunday nights.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Apparently some websites. Who put this, Go Nintendo?

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
Go Nintendo had a video or I should say a voice mail from Mario himself.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Charles Martinet.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
Yes. Announcing Super Mario Bros. 3 will be out tomorrow.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I love Super Mario Bros. 3.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Mario 3 is fucking rad. I love playing through Mario 3 and not using warp zones.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Because I love Giant World. Who doesn't love Giant World?

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Giant World is the best, but you know what? My favorite is going in Kuriboh's shoe.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
There's only like one level in the whole game where you do that, huh?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
It's not even a mandatory level, is it?

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
But with the Game Boy, with the Game Genie code back in the day, you could keep the shoe through other levels.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Awesome.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Which sort of made it stupid for the ones you have to fly to get to shit though.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Now all you need is to actually be able to play this game online.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
Like imagine if you could be Mario and play against a Luigi that's millions of miles away.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
You know that's not going to happen.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Fun. It should.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
But will it?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I don't know.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Anyway, for UK Virtual Console, we've got some fun stuff.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
Sonic 3D Flickies Island for 800 Wii points will be out.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
The Sonic 3D games were sort of interesting.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
They weren't really 3D, just sort of 3D. But anyway.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I can't believe it's not 3D.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, I can't believe it's not 3D, exactly.

04:40.000 --> 04:49.000
And then we also have, as soon as it loads, Samurai Ghost, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
Which is a side-scrolling, you know, slash fighter shooter, you know, guy with a sword game.

04:57.000 --> 05:07.000
And I think it's funny, the whole purpose of the game, according to the opening screen, is it's an order from the King of Heaven.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
And then we have Art of Fighting, Neo Geo.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And I don't need to say anything more about Art of Fighting, because that's the game that gave us...

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
King.

05:17.000 --> 05:24.000
No. Well, besides King, it gave us the two characters that spawned the introduction of Dan Hibiki in the Street Fighter series.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Which would be Ryo and Robert Garcia.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Was Dan supposed to be like a parody of them or something?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Yes, he was.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
How funny.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Because Ryo was like a Ryu knock-off.

05:35.000 --> 05:46.000
And Robert Garcia had, I guess, he had some other moves, so they actually combined the two characters into, you know, Mr. Sucktastic Godoken.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
So I thought it was great.

05:47.000 --> 05:56.000
And again, keep in mind, Dan's like one of my favorite characters, especially in Puzzle Fighter, because you have to be really freaking good to beat people in Puzzle Fighter using Dan.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Because he drops all red blocks.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So you have to drop a lot really fast.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Yeah, you have to be really good, and I can proudly say that I've beaten somebody using Devilot.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Or pray that a red, uh, a red break gem never falls.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Seriously.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
But, you know, I digress.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Which is the whole point of the show, digression.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
Awesome.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
Anyways, so, you know, we don't really talk too much about Atari.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, they don't give us a lot that's worth talking about anymore.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
In case you haven't heard, Atari, they have not too many licensed games out there.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I mean, I think the last few licensed games haven't been that great.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
You know, what with the, um, they used to have the Driver series.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Of course, they lost the Driver series.

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
And now they're battling to retain the Dragon Ball Z license, because pretty much the only big game that they release every year is the Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi game.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
And now that might not be the case.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
Just one? I thought every year they would release over 9000 of these games.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
They may sell only over 9000, but no, I don't know.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
It's kind of sad to see, because really all that they're going to be left after this is gone is pretty much alone in the dark.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
You know what?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
This is what I have to say, first of all, two things.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
One about Dragon Ball Z and one about Atari.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
Dragon Ball Z has been off the air in Japan when I graduated college.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
Well, I didn't graduate college, but when I was out of high school.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
No, I take that back because I had an episode taped off the TV.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Okay, the series ended in the mid-90s.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We are now in the late 2000s.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
It's old. Drop it.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Well, they have Dragon Ball GT now.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It's Drag on Ball.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
No, Dragon Ball GT has been over and done with for years.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Just find something.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Well, no, now we're getting Bleach, and Bleach is the new Dragon Ball.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
But we're in the United States, not Japan.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
But it still doesn't mean it's not even old over here.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It's still old.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
You know, the whole thing is saturated.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And that and Atari, oh my God.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
ActDef says in our chatroom, chat.orangetonsharing.com, ActDef says,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Atari, doing nothing since the 1980s.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
And to tell Ranma, Dragon Ball GT, in my opinion, does kind of count,

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
because it was going back to the original, you know, flair of what Dragon Ball was.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
But Dragon Ball Z was better.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay, I would like to make a point here real quick.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
This is how bad this is going to be for Atari.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Okay, let me put it this way.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
This is their big games for the fourth quarter.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
You have Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkai G3, okay.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
Godzilla Unleashed, which is a Godzilla fighting game on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and the DS.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
I kid you not, I kid you not, Jenga on the Wii and the DS.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
I remember reporting on this game when it was first announced.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
We were like, the fuck? Can't you just play, like, real Jenga?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Which I believe they did at the Penny Arcade Expo.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
They played real Jenga.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And to be honest, then they also have another, like, classic compilation game coming through the PSP.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Because that's all that ever comes out of the PSP.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
That's it.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That's all they have coming out of this here.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
Alone in the Dark, whatever it is, Fie, or Alone in the Dark, New Alone in the Dark.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Alone in the Dark, Tim Curry's voice isn't in this game, so don't buy it.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Basically, right?

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Okay, I have to make a correction and I have to do this by timeline.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Oh, you know, I got Alone in the Dark mixed up with Gabriel...

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Never mind, forget it.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Gabriel Knight?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, forget it.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Okay.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Dragon Ball Z was replaced by Rurouni Kenshin.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Rurouni Kenshin was replaced by Naruto.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And now Bleach is doing its damnedest.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So that's the transition I'd like to point out.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Seriously, companies, stop making so many Naruto games.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I mean, there's, like, five every year.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Seriously, we don't need that many Naruto games.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
I think I have, like, a stack of them in our vault collecting dust.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
In the vault.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
No, it really is the vault.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
It's a whole room dedicated to my video game collection.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Alright.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, anyhow, you know, they say imitation is the finest form of flattery, but...

10:22.000 --> 10:30.000
I don't know about this one, because apparently, there is now a... Walmart is now selling these little knockoff Wiimotes.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
It's a device made by Toy Quest.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
And what it is, it basically looks like a Wiimote, but it has a little LCD screen on the Wiimote.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
And you actually play tennis with this Wiimote.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
It's a little tiny LCD screen, but I don't even think it has motion control or whatever.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Because the screen is so fucking tiny.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
It would be hilarious if it did.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
If you swung it, how would you see it?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I'll swing it, and then, oh shit.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
You know what? Someone needs to hack it to be a VMU emulator.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And put a chow on there.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Seriously, these things cost under $20.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
I want to say it said it was, like, $7 for this thing.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And that might be too much for this.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So, I don't know about that.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
But, yeah, if you want to...

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Quality.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
Let's say, like, you know, it might be a really cruel joke to play on someone.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Let's say you have this annoying little cousin that wants a Wii for Christmas.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
You could get them this, and say, well, you know, Santa gave all the Wiis to the good kids.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Somebody had this left over for you to give to you.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.000
Yeah, people should give, like, crappy useless toys to the bad children instead of coal.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Because you can actually use coal.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
This is what you get for being a bad kid.

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
Is that like, you know, driving kids by a burned-out factory, telling them that Disneyland burned down or something?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
No, that was deep thoughts.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I know that was deep thoughts.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
With Jack Handy.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Anyhow, so yeah, those are kind of stupid.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
And you know what?

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
These types of things, and these knock-offs, and these unoriginal bastards, and tiny little LCD screens that try to pass for a game.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
These things just piss us off, and it makes us angsty.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
And when we get mad, people die.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Or at least the FUs of the week are unleashed.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
FU goes towards the digestion problems I inherited from my mother.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Mom, fuck your jeans.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I mean, I love you.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
And her birthday tomorrow, so happy birthday to my mom, who will be 48.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Happy birthday, Jamie's mom.

12:49.000 --> 12:57.000
But anyway, yeah, everything I eat really makes me sick, so I'm just gonna stop eating altogether.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Except for couscous.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
I'm gonna be living on a solid diet of couscous and wonton soup.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Because those are two things that don't make me sick.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
You can change what you look like.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Online multiplayer, you can change what you look like.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Put system link for some reason, and they're just like, ah, fuck it.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
So, fuck them.

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
I continued FU to the bruise on my leg that still kind of hurts this week, but at least it's getting a little better.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
Maybe I can roll my pants up far enough I can show you one.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Actually, I probably can't. My bruise is in here. I can't roll my pants up that far.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
I might be a little too much skin for operator 11, so no show for you.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I was gonna say one more thing real quick.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
What?

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I tried to perform a level 3 execution on my wife's leg.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
You know, Manhunt 2 reference.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
She attacked her leg with her back claw, and it sliced it.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
It looked like she was trying to cut her leg off or something.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
What a kitty.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
But, you know, without...

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
It was the cutest level 3 execution ever.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
That's it. My FU just went to my bruise on my leg.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
So, at least I don't have to have the Band-Aid on it anymore.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Puppy!

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
My FU goes to your neighborhood for there being no street lights and street signs covered by trees.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
Because I almost got lost getting here because I couldn't read anything.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah, I followed him all the way from the big main road over, and I was like,

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
Hey, I bet that's Puppy, because I saw the college sticker on your car.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And then I was like, he went right past Rob Street.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I almost went right past Rob Street.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
It is kind of, yeah, they don't really have street lights here.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
They didn't invent them yet, I guess, when these houses were built. What can I say?

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It's rural.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
And FU to the housing market, because I got scared a little bit.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
And when half the people that I work with at my company got laid off this week.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
No!

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
Well, I do drafting work for a carpenter.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
And they just laid off a bunch of their foremen.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
I hope I get laid off.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
No, seriously, because if I get laid off, I get like three months of severance pay and collect unemployment while I start my massage business.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
That'd be fantastic.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Awesome.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
That would be nice.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Nice little cushion.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Alright, well that's going to do it for our FUs of the week.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Shall we?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
We shall.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
We shall.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Dark Soccer, why don't you take it away?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I don't wanna.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
You gotta.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Why?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Because I said so.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Okay, fine.

15:55.000 --> 16:04.000
For anyone who follows the Child's Play charity, the 5th annual Child's Play charity drive is beginning.

16:04.000 --> 16:14.000
Basically, the whole charity was the brainchild of the Penny Arcade powers that be.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
And is now, you know, basically the gaming community's way of giving to those in need.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
You know, for children who are in hospitals in 25 states and 5 countries.

16:25.000 --> 16:33.000
So you can make your, you can donate your items through Amazon and it is considered a tax-deductible gift.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
So keep that in mind if you have those deductions coming up.

16:36.000 --> 16:46.000
The drive, sorry, is, their fundraiser dinner, I apologize, is set to take place on December 11th at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
So go play.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Get the brainstorming, folks.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
We need to think of what we here at OLR can do to help out this lovely charity that gives gamers a good name.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
So we'll have to think of something we can donate or a fundraiser we can do.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Maybe we'll have a ditter-thon, a DDR-thon.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Wouldn't that be fun?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Okay, maybe not.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
You never know.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
You never know.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
We'll think of something.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
So one awesome game that's coming out this year has gone gold and that would be Crysis.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
It's due out November 16th so I hope you have your new PC by now because you're going to need it.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.000
And of course it will be the first game to utilize the CryEngine 2.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
No, that's not the same engine used in Yaris.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
That's a different CryEngine.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
And of course, hopefully it will be coming to the console soon.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
There is a single player demo that's available now which hackers have gone ahead

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
and poked their noses through some of the DirectX workaround codes inside there.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
And they've found stuff like hidden weapons, vehicles, and bad guys from the full version.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
So now with a little bit of cutting and pasting they're able to play with every gun in the game

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
as well as tanks and attack chopper.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Sounds like how I play games.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Yeah, it does.

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
All the guns and tank and attack chopper right next to me in Cooking Mama.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Awesome.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Well this might be a game that Loki is going to want to hack too.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
I don't know.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
But this is the American McGee version of Grimm and it's coming to GameTap.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
I actually did play a little bit of GameTap this week so I actually saw this ad.

18:27.000 --> 18:33.000
They're actually going to be releasing a 24 episode series of this.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
So it's kind of like think Sam and Max but like really, really long.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
It's going to start in 2008 in the spring and they're already running the ads on it.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
And the little quote from the ad says,

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
This spring American McGee thrust you into an incredible adventure built around the world's best known fairy tales.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
Meet Snow White, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, and more of your favorites in 24 game episodes.

18:53.000 --> 18:59.000
And of course American McGee did that Alice in Wonderland game that was pretty fucked.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
So I'm sure you're going to see lots of your fairy tales done the right way.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
Dark and gory the way they were originally.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
I will be looking forward to, I imagine this is going to have to be in it,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
The Hansel and Gretel because I can't wait to push the witch in the oven.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
That'll be fun.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
The original fairy tales were all kinds of messed up.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I mean who would read that to their children?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I would.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
My mom handed me the book and said go read it and don't come bother me until you finish this chapter.

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
I would like to see the grim fairy tales done by Sam and Max because I think that would be awesome.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
That would be kind of fun.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Anyways.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Sony is going to be doing an animated Resident Evil movie.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
It's actually a CG animation.

19:47.000 --> 19:52.000
They're calling it Biohazard Degeneration in Japan.

19:52.000 --> 19:58.000
There's a presumption that it's going to be called Resident Evil Finding Necro over here.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Which is kind of a dumb name.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
They said it's going to have groundbreaking visual effects and a brand new storyline.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
So.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh well.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
We'll see.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
It's supposed to be out in 2008.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Nah, we won't see.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I don't really want to see it.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
I mean I'm kind of over Resident Evil like 10 years ago.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
I liked the last movie.

20:20.000 --> 20:27.000
If you're over Resident Evil, perhaps you may be interested in a few other films that are coming.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
Including Onimusha which is starting production in April.

20:32.000 --> 20:39.000
Apparently they also have a poster now revealed for the Tekken movie.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Which the poster looks stupid.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
I might add, it's a giant T that looks like it's being held up.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
T for Tekken!

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Wow!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
It's creative.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Yay!

20:49.000 --> 20:54.000
It's already down the road of DOA.

20:54.000 --> 21:02.000
It's apparently the Onimusha adaption is expected to begin in April of 2008.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And of course Silent Hill director Christopher Gons is going to be at the helm.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Well that may not suck.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
May not.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
May not.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
May not.

21:12.000 --> 21:19.000
And unfortunately the Tekken poster, if I were to sum up the movie based on the poster,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
I would say suck.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
And based on the poster I'd be all, where's Big Bird?

21:26.000 --> 21:34.000
To tell me, this episode was brought to you by the letter T and the number 69.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
And how many times have fighting games made good movies?

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
Hey, I remember the Tekken anime that came out.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Well, animes are usually better than movies anyways.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
The Tekken anime, my problem with that is that it was all completely done on computer,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
and I prefer cel animation.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
So, that's what was bad about that.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah, it also had a lot of butt rock in it.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Well, the American one did.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Yeah, the US one.

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
Alright, well we're talking a lot about video games becoming movies, but now let's mention

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
movies becoming video games.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Pirates of the Caribbean, of course, actually that was a ride at Disneyland first and foremost.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Then it was a movie, and now it is an online MMO.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
We've talked about this on the game before that it was coming.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
It's now here.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
If you want to check it out, piratesonline.com.

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
The basic game is free, but for $10 a month you get full access.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
The game, by the way, is based off of the Toontown online engine,

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
so don't expect any cutting edge graphics.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
I'm also wondering if it's based off Toontown online.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
That probably means you can't actually type your own sentences.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
You have to make things from the pre-rendered things that are in there

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
because we have to keep our children safe because these are Disney games.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Like using the Final Fantasy XI macros?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
I don't know that for sure.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Don't quote me on that.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I don't know if that's the case in this game.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I don't know if any of our chatters have played it,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
but I just know in Toontown that was the case.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
I had a friend that played Toontown for a long-ass time, actually.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Pirates of the Caribbean, I wouldn't mind checking this out.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
I would check it out, but puzzle pirates would probably still be better.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Maybe.

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
And plus, my fondness for Pirates of the Caribbean is the ride, not the movie.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
I know that might be like blessed for me to some people,

23:19.000 --> 23:24.000
but I could care less about John E. Depp.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Although he was a kind of cool addition to the ride

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
and some of the other stuff they added on the ride.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Anyhow, some of the stuff we're going to add to the Part B of our podcast tonight

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
is a segment we love and know and have here every week on the program.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
It's the mailbag, and it's our chance to interact with you, the listener,

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
when you send us e-mails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
Dark Sakura will pull out a few of her favorite e-mails,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
and this week she has to be really picky

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
because we actually got a lot of e-mails this week.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, I still have a number I'm going to have to end up reading.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Sadly, Dark Sakura is going to have to be a bit choosy this week

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
in what e-mails she's reading.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Wait, did we get any jokes?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
We'll see.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
We will see.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
All right, well, we have one that says,

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Hey guys, I was wondering if you could recommend some older 360 games

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
that might be worth picking up used.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I was thinking about PSU, but not sure if it was any good.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Thanks.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
This comes from Mark.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
PSU sucks, so don't play it.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
You're not going to get a deal on PSU either

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
because you still have that $10 monthly fee.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I don't think you can get that used because of that.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I think there's that whole, I don't know.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
No, you can't.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
You can't because you have to register an account.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
I'll give you mine.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Do you want my copy?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I don't want it. Maybe the listener does.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Get in touch with the listener.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
You can also play the offline version for free,

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
so don't necessarily think you have to play it online.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
Plus, the expansion is coming out here pretty soon.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
They've already done a butt load.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
My friend, Julie, Castame19, she plays a butt ton.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
She is always on that fucking game whenever I'm on live.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
She does nothing but play that game.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Wow, amazing.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
She's like, that's her ever crack.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Tips from the chat room.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
Rob with two B's is mentioning Circuit City has PSU on the cheap.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
So if you're interested in that,

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
some of the folks are recommending some games.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Act Deft recommending Condemned.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
DMN recommending Crackdown.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Crackdown is the I like jumping game.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
I recommend staying the hell away from Perfect Dark Zero, first off.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
I liked Perfect Dark Zero.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
You would.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
But I would suggest Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
To me, that is the best 360 title.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Burnout.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Yes.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Okay, I do like crashing.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Even if it is an old game with souped up graphics.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
How about Test Drive Unlimited?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
That was a good game that I think...

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
How about no?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
How about Kiss My Butt?

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
If you want some older games that have dropped in price, Dead Rising.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, Dead Rising is a good one.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
If you can find that.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Actually, Far Cry Instincts Predator wasn't that bad.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
I thought you said good games.

26:01.000 --> 26:08.000
And then I would also say probably not Prey, that's for sure.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Definitely not Chromehounds.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Hey, I liked Prey.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Definitely not Chromehounds.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
Prey was like Ghetto Portal.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
But I wouldn't buy Burnout, because there's a new Burnout game coming out in January.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
I would say probably...

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Gosh.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Okay, we've given enough suggestions.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
Well, it's not that old, but Oblivion is also really good for a solo game.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Alright, you have plenty of suggestions.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
We have an email from another Mark.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Your suggestion quota is up.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Hi, Mark.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Hi, it's amazing.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
My brother and I were talking about Count Decula, but we couldn't remember the name.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
We also said you can't do that on television.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Farf.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
About Loki's a few of the week to women.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
If you haven't learned by now, you will.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
You as a male will always lose arguments against women.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
I didn't believe it when people told me.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
True statement.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
But it's true.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Men are from Mars and women have already invaded it and destroyed all that are holy.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Of course we have, because we're excellent.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
So, I'm trying to find more short ones, because we've got a couple of long ones.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
Wait, hold on, because I'm trying to load a little something for that last emailer.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Because I played the You Can't Do That television theme earlier.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Castle Decula.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.000
Home for many centuries to a dreadful dynasty of vicious...

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Tell me you would not play a fucking video game based on this.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
This would be awesome.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
The castle of Decula.

27:30.000 --> 27:37.000
Legend has it that these foul beings can be destroyed by escape through the heart or exposure to sub-light.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
This does not suffice, however, for they may be brought back to life by means of a secret.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I apologize, the audio is so low.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Once a century, when the moon is in the eighth house...

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
We've been wearing blood.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Are you kidding?

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
The latest reincarnation did not run, according to plan.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Ooh.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, it's a kitchen.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Here's the techno part.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Yes.

28:00.000 --> 28:07.000
In the vampire hall of fame, yeah, there's not a vampire in the other house.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
You won't bite me from there, cause he's a virgin, yeah.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
And things never burn flat for a while.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
If you're looking for someone, you can always count upon.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
This is the most random opening of Decula.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Count Decula.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
For anyone who doesn't know, God, it's so loud.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
Count Decula was actually a character from Danger Mouse.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Awesome.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
If anyone who ever watched Danger Mouse.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
So this other one says the classic game of the week segment seems to be like obscure cult hit of the week.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
It says will you be featuring games that are a little more known to us?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
But it's cyberbots.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Yeah, like everybody knows cyberbots.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
To be honest, I think part of the charm...

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
A lot of people know cyberbots.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
Part of the charm is that she's featuring games that a lot of us miss.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
To me, that's kind of the point.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
I mean, if she were to go back and say today's classic game of the week is Contra.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
Y'all fucking played Contra.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Maybe she'll feature it later.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
I don't know.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
I kind of like the obscurity for now.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
Well, keep in mind that all of the classic games that I like are really the more obscure ones anyway.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
So, of course, if I'm going to be picking out the games, I'm going to be picking out all the weird shit that I like.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
You know, but I covered Fantasy Zone. That's not obscure.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Yeah.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
You know, okay, I'll do Guardian Legend.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Even that's kind of obscure for some people, but...

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
This is my favorite game.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
I say do what you want.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You know, I'm going to do what I want.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
That's right. I'm going to do what I want.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
But...

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
I go to school and I kill people.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I'm wrong with gangs.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yo, and so you know what?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah, I digitally inserted Jabba the Hutt back in Star Wars.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I'll do what I want.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
I'm wrong with gangs.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
To be fair, I do like a good number of, you know, I guess more mainstream titles.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
You know, I won't do one of Colibri.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
You know, if anyone remembers that 32X classic.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
But, you know, I would do, you know, like Knuckles Chaotix.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Yeah, that one was cool.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Alright.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Or, you know, Space Harrier.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Thanks for the feedback, but she'll do what she wants.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
But do yourself a favor.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Check out some of these obscure games because they were actually kind of fun.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, I mean, you can find emulators of Cotton.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Cotton's great.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
Cotton came out in the U.S. on Neo Geo Pocket Color.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
And on the...

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
No, just on Neo Geo Pocket Color.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
You know what?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Don't bother defending.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Just say, I'm going to do what I want.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
I'm saying how people can find these games easily.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Oh, okay.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
So it did have U.S. release.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
Anyway, this one comes from J-Rod.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Hi, J-Rod.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Love the show you guys put on.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
I really dig how the show is live.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
I have two guitars on my PS2 with both Guitar Hero 1 and 2.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
Now, the problem is I don't have my PS2 anymore, but I do have a PS3, a 60 gig that can play

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
the old PS2 games.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
Apparently, Sony and everyone else didn't bother to make an adapter to get the Guitar

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Hero controllers to work on the PS3.

30:59.000 --> 31:04.000
I was wondering if any of you guys had any first-hand experiences or knew anyone who

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
did with the aftermarket adapters out there and could give me a recommendation or review

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
of any of them.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Thanks and keep up the awesome show.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
I think Pelican makes one that works.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
There is an adapter out there I know that works.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I would bet money it causes a delay, though.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
I don't think it did.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
Really?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Yeah.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I know there's one that we did as a story a while back.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Luckily, I didn't actually bet the money.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
That actually does work, so I don't know.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Xenocore in chat room.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
See, well, we don't know.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
We can always rely on chat room.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Xenocore in chat says, not true.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
I have the adapter.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
So there you have it.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Whatever.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
I don't know.

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
Well, also, I think that it's great that there's a...

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Sony doesn't love you there.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.920
I also think it's fantastic that it says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home

31:47.920 --> 31:50.000
of the Neverending Salads.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.320
I don't know why I find that funny.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.320
Olive Garden.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.320
Not for the Salads, though.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.320
Do I know?

31:54.320 --> 31:57.320
OLR, I appreciate that you guys tell us the Japanese release dates, but I was wondering

31:57.320 --> 32:02.000
if you guys have any Japanese listeners, and I guess this comes from Thomas.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
I think we do.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
I'm pretty sure we do.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.640
When we check the stats, we do see quite a number of connections from Japan, and we've

32:08.640 --> 32:11.360
gotten emails from listeners in Japan before, too.

32:11.360 --> 32:16.600
We've got people all over the world, because we are cool that way.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.600
So now for the really freaking long emails.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.160
How about that?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.160
Yay.

32:21.160 --> 32:24.000
Really freaking long email segment.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.760
Dear OLR, pointing to a letter that was sent to you last week, it really assumes to me

32:28.760 --> 32:31.920
that a fellow gamer can be so blatantly ignorant.

32:31.920 --> 32:35.840
Has anyone ever considered the fact that one of the main reasons that Nintendo has managed

32:35.840 --> 32:39.160
to stay afloat for so long is because of its first party games?

32:39.160 --> 32:43.320
Starting with the Nintendo 64, the graphics of the system sucked.

32:43.320 --> 32:47.200
The audio play was horrible, but it still managed to give you a few of the great franchises

32:47.200 --> 32:51.680
that you and I loved, like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and other well-known franchises, and bring

32:51.680 --> 32:59.440
them, though it still looked horrible, the GameCube may have been a different story.

32:59.440 --> 33:03.000
In my opinion, the GameCube was a great system, while not on par with that of the Xbox and

33:03.000 --> 33:07.120
PlayStation 2, it had excellent graphics, and almost all games played in high frame

33:07.120 --> 33:08.120
rate.

33:08.120 --> 33:30.320
It was a big deal when Prime came out, because it was OMGZ Metroid.

33:30.320 --> 33:54.440
It also brought your favorite franchise into beautiful 3D detail, but it would have been

33:54.440 --> 33:56.640
so much better if they had online play.

33:56.640 --> 34:02.920
I wouldn't have even bought my GameCube if it didn't have a new Metroid game.

34:02.920 --> 34:06.680
Nintendo's first party developers have managed to bring back our favorite franchises and

34:06.680 --> 34:09.640
make us love them that much more with each new title.

34:09.640 --> 34:13.120
It's mainly because of the fact that Nintendo first party developers and the fact that they

34:13.120 --> 34:17.600
make such great games are the only reason Nintendo managed this far.

34:17.600 --> 34:22.040
Though I may not know everything, I just want to point out that these few details are far

34:22.040 --> 34:25.040
as it goes with Nintendo's first party games and developers.

34:25.040 --> 34:28.000
Let's just hope that it doesn't repeat any past mistakes.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.620
To the Yaris, this is a letter that was sent to the Xbox Live Arcade.

34:31.620 --> 34:32.620
It said,

34:32.620 --> 34:34.260
Dear Xbox Live Arcade,

34:34.260 --> 34:35.840
We have always had a great relationship.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.340
The day I met you, you sent me Geometry Wars.

34:38.340 --> 34:39.340
Now you sent me Yaris.

34:39.340 --> 34:40.760
Does this mean you're breaking up with me?

34:40.760 --> 34:41.760
Sincerely, Anonymous

34:41.760 --> 35:07.240
Hi O.L.R., I love your show, y'all are amazing, do we have a southern guy?

35:07.240 --> 35:08.240
Cool.

35:08.240 --> 35:12.760
I listened to y'all everywhere I go, and named my firstborn daughter Skye.

35:12.760 --> 35:13.760
Wow.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.760
Send the birth certificate as proof, I don't believe it.

35:16.760 --> 35:20.720
So on and so forth, pleasantries aside, to beat the proverbial dead horse, your qualms

35:20.720 --> 35:25.280
concerning the term microtransactions would give even Captain Jean-Luc Picard a headache

35:25.280 --> 35:26.280
of massive proportions.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.040
Oh, not this debate again.

35:28.040 --> 35:31.480
Granted, I agree with you wholeheartedly, Dark Soccer, that a transaction on any scale

35:31.480 --> 35:34.140
is a transaction no matter the amount of money involved.

35:34.140 --> 35:37.840
The term microtransaction is merely an industry buzzword to help encourage sales of downloadable

35:37.840 --> 35:39.680
data, unlock content, buy the ignorant masses.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.560
It's stupid, it's asinine, but it's business.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.840
I agree.

35:43.840 --> 35:48.080
That being said, to refer to microtransactions as being an SI unit, hence spouting, is a

35:48.080 --> 35:51.760
microtransaction one millionth of a transaction as equally as asinine?

35:51.760 --> 35:53.520
Well, true, yeah.

35:53.520 --> 35:57.040
Would you say Halo 3 sold three gigacopies?

35:57.040 --> 35:58.760
Okay.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.680
Micro in this sense is not used as a prefix for an actual numerical factor such as centi,

36:02.680 --> 36:09.040
milli, kilo, nano, etc., but more as a description of relative size in contrast with macro.

36:09.040 --> 36:12.320
Refer to the established English terms of macroeconomics and microeconomics, if you

36:12.320 --> 36:13.320
will.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.760
But no one says microtransactions anyway.

36:15.760 --> 36:16.760
Why?

36:16.760 --> 36:21.660
Because as the English language is to buzzwords, human being is to a horribly grotesque cross-species

36:21.660 --> 36:24.000
partial abortion, think Minotaur.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.100
It never should have been and should have been put out of its misery, which I'm quite

36:28.100 --> 36:33.840
sure the entirety of Orange Lodge Radio will be quite eager to do after reading this superfluous,

36:33.840 --> 36:37.840
verbose, and...

36:37.840 --> 36:40.640
Thank you, whoever emailed this animator to read these words.

36:40.640 --> 36:43.240
Hey, I have very good pronunciation, thank you.

36:43.240 --> 36:46.280
A mixationally nitpicky email comprised of run-on sentences.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.080
I do have to agree with you there.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.520
It is fairly run-on.

36:49.520 --> 36:54.680
Although actually you are grammatically correct in your last sentence, I have to say.

36:54.680 --> 36:58.200
I shall spare you any further opportunities to become tongue-tied and I wish you all the

36:58.200 --> 36:59.200
best.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.320
I look forward to each episode as eagerly as the cocaine addict awaits for his next

37:02.320 --> 37:03.320
hit of snow.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.400
Rubber Buggy Baby Bumpers, D.J.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.400
Dysentery.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.400
And by the way, you...

37:07.400 --> 37:08.400
By the way...

37:08.400 --> 37:11.960
Okay, he obviously was putting that in just to fuck with you.

37:11.960 --> 37:16.240
By the way, you misspelled cocaine.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.280
The end!

37:17.280 --> 37:19.680
When did I go back to college English class?

37:19.680 --> 37:20.920
I know, for real.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.920
This reminds me of fan fiction.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.760
I think someday, like, you know, when...

37:24.760 --> 37:26.680
Wordy and pointless?

37:26.680 --> 37:31.440
Inevitably, this show must end someday and obviously, you know, we don't want it to end

37:31.440 --> 37:36.480
tomorrow, but inevitably we will go our separate ways someday and I totally see Dark Sakura

37:36.480 --> 37:39.920
starting a grammar Nazi podcast.

37:39.920 --> 37:40.920
There already is one.

37:40.920 --> 37:41.920
Is there really?

37:41.920 --> 37:42.920
I'm pretty sure there already is one.

37:42.920 --> 37:43.920
I wouldn't be surprised.

37:43.920 --> 37:44.920
There's also...

37:44.920 --> 37:50.800
You can find a podcast, no, there is a grammar Nazi podcast because somebody has sent it

37:50.800 --> 37:51.800
to me.

37:51.800 --> 37:52.800
Where?

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
No, I'm not even kidding.

37:53.800 --> 37:54.800
Where can I download it?

37:54.800 --> 38:01.840
I can't remember who did it, but I listened to it about a year and a half ago where they

38:01.840 --> 38:07.000
would receive emails about, you know, different grammatical mistakes and then try to give

38:07.000 --> 38:11.720
you the proper way to say that and certain usages and when it's appropriate to use this

38:11.720 --> 38:18.440
spelling or that spelling and I also found one that was all about the differences between

38:18.440 --> 38:19.920
British English and American English.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.680
Where can I get that podcast?

38:22.680 --> 38:24.880
LOL.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.880
You know what?

38:25.880 --> 38:29.100
You can do what everybody else does and search for it on iTunes.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.100
I don't want to.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.360
I hate that my iPhone is making me use iTunes, though.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.360
Can you continue?

38:34.360 --> 38:35.360
What?

38:35.360 --> 38:36.360
We is done.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.360
Oh, no more emails?

38:37.360 --> 38:38.360
We is done.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.100
We is done.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.960
We done good on those emails.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.320
All right, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.120
Sorry to the people we didn't get to tonight.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.120
There's just too damn many emails.

38:49.120 --> 38:50.120
What can we say?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.120
Back to the gaming news.

38:51.120 --> 38:55.080
Anyways, with all these patches and stuff being applied to new games for the PlayStation

38:55.080 --> 38:59.400
3 and games that you might already have on the PlayStation 3, to support the DualShock

38:59.400 --> 39:05.760
3 has gotten a lot of people wondering, hey, maybe I can just import a Japanese DualShock

39:05.760 --> 39:12.140
controller into my non-Japanese country and get to play these games with rumble-tastic

39:12.140 --> 39:15.760
features sooner than everybody else.

39:15.760 --> 39:16.760
Nope.

39:16.760 --> 39:21.080
Because apparently importers like PlayASIA said they've already pre-sold their expected

39:21.080 --> 39:30.920
supply and Sony, of course, doesn't support importing stuff, so you will not be able to

39:30.920 --> 39:33.400
probably buy any anytime soon.

39:33.400 --> 39:40.480
Because actually importers are charging upwards to $80 per joystick for what you would probably

39:40.480 --> 39:44.440
normally get for $50 and I'm sure that's going to go up.

39:44.440 --> 39:49.220
Of course, new games, they just had a patch for Resistance Fall Man that added rumble.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.060
I know MotorStorm has rumble now.

39:52.060 --> 39:55.880
There was a patch with Ratchet and Clank Future that has rumble.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.720
Just fucking wait.

39:57.720 --> 40:00.640
Why would they have to patch in rumble features?

40:00.640 --> 40:06.440
Because you know the original 6-axis controller had no rumble, because rumble would interfere

40:06.440 --> 40:12.020
with the tilt sensors somehow in this magical world, because you can't actually have tilt

40:12.020 --> 40:21.040
and rumble in the same controller, oh wait, no, Nintendo did that, I'm sorry.

40:21.040 --> 40:28.280
Just wait, really, I mean, playing Resistance Fall Man with rumble is not going to make

40:28.280 --> 40:31.280
it like, oh my god, this is the best game ever now.

40:31.280 --> 40:36.200
The only game I really want to play with rumble is Rez, and I would hand off the rumble to

40:36.200 --> 40:37.200
someone else.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.880
Because you know Rez is on the PS3.

40:38.880 --> 40:44.160
We've all read that article.

40:44.160 --> 40:48.920
Well we have a, I guess, late breaking news thing, I'm going to jump in here with something

40:48.920 --> 40:52.200
that's panning out live while the show is going on.

40:52.200 --> 40:59.580
I need like a fanfare or something, or we need something, I don't know.

40:59.580 --> 41:00.580
What do we have?

41:00.580 --> 41:02.040
How about a drum roll with a laptop?

41:02.040 --> 41:06.720
I'm looking for a fanfare noise, hold on, let's see.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.720
Like the little windows?

41:07.720 --> 41:09.760
Oh here we go, yes, we've got it.

41:09.760 --> 41:19.880
Now some late breaking news.

41:19.880 --> 41:25.000
Act Deft is practically flooding our chat room with what is going on in the latest Game

41:25.000 --> 41:26.580
Facts Battle.

41:26.580 --> 41:29.980
You know, every damn year they do a character battle, every year.

41:29.980 --> 41:34.640
This is the sixth year of the character battle, and what makes this year different is that

41:34.640 --> 41:40.720
instead of two characters doing battle, it's groups of four, and then two emerge victorious.

41:40.720 --> 41:46.520
Well we are now down to the final four, and typical winners Link and Cloud are in there,

41:46.520 --> 41:47.640
they've both won before.

41:47.640 --> 41:53.280
Solid Snake is also in the top four, but this is the amazing thing, is that this looks to

41:53.280 --> 42:00.900
be the very first year that a Final Fantasy character or a Link character will not win

42:00.900 --> 42:02.280
the character battle.

42:02.280 --> 42:10.800
That is because with 45 minutes to go, and 33% of the vote, L-Block is winning the character

42:10.800 --> 42:11.800
battle.

42:11.800 --> 42:12.800
Yay!

42:12.800 --> 42:20.200
So NBC News has declared an L-Block victory tonight in the great character battle elections.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.480
Congratulations to the L-Block.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.160
Did I miss something?

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
Seriously?

42:25.160 --> 42:26.800
Because Tetris is a pone.

42:26.800 --> 42:30.920
Because somehow an L-Block just fucking beat all these other characters, but I think, you

42:30.920 --> 42:33.880
know what though, well deserved, honestly.

42:33.880 --> 42:38.600
Well deserved, because Tetris is one of those games I think people forget, you know, that

42:38.600 --> 42:40.380
is the casual game.

42:40.380 --> 42:44.040
That was the casual game that really opened up the gaming door to a lot of people.

42:44.040 --> 42:47.080
I'm just glad that news had nothing to do with Tingle, so that's, I thought for a second

42:47.080 --> 42:51.920
there they were just going to be like, yeah, Tingle's going to win, and I'm like, fuck.

42:51.920 --> 42:53.920
That's going to suck.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.560
Well I can't wait for that, yeah.

42:55.560 --> 42:56.560
That'll never happen.

42:56.560 --> 43:00.520
This just in, I Have Judgment sold its millionth copy, hope you get the tights.

43:00.520 --> 43:04.080
There's some interesting things about I Have Judgment too that I heard of.

43:04.080 --> 43:09.760
Do you know how many people have come in to chat tonight and said, one down, 999,999 to

43:09.760 --> 43:10.760
go.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.520
Our whole contest has become counter productive.

43:12.520 --> 43:16.160
We are driving sales of I Have Judgment.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.520
I heard they have issues.

43:17.520 --> 43:19.080
How so?

43:19.080 --> 43:21.340
I heard they have a subscription.

43:21.340 --> 43:26.240
They have similar issues to Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.140
Interesting.

43:28.140 --> 43:29.640
Certain integral parts of...

43:29.640 --> 43:32.400
They're not even going to be able to make a million of them.

43:32.400 --> 43:37.000
You goddamn cheater.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.680
Loki fucking cheated in this contest.

43:38.680 --> 43:40.720
He knew they didn't have the parts to make a million of them.

43:40.720 --> 43:42.400
How about I cleanse the pallet?

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
Asshole.

43:43.400 --> 43:46.440
And didn't I say this was going to happen?

43:46.440 --> 43:47.440
Didn't I tell you?

43:47.440 --> 43:50.040
No, wait, I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't do my actual story.

43:50.040 --> 43:51.040
I have one question.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.040
Oh, I thought you did.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.040
No.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.040
Well, fine.

43:54.040 --> 43:55.040
I have to do the Famitsu story real quick.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.040
Fine, do it.

43:56.040 --> 43:59.200
You're going off on your tangents, confusing me.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.200
Sorry.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.200
Goddammit.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.200
Chocolate.

44:02.200 --> 44:06.640
Get the bitch some chocolate, Christ almighty.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.600
But I'm not going to eat it.

44:09.600 --> 44:10.600
Here you go.

44:10.600 --> 44:13.960
And damn it, I accidentally closed the tab that had this story on it, now I can't even

44:13.960 --> 44:14.960
do it.

44:14.960 --> 44:19.320
Famitsu ran a list of the top 100 games that readers dig, and actually this is kind of

44:19.320 --> 44:23.320
similar to the character battle because I believe all the top games were basically Final

44:23.320 --> 44:25.240
Fantasy games and Zelda games.

44:25.240 --> 44:27.920
I'm trying to bring up the list right now.

44:27.920 --> 44:31.440
Our very own Dark Tetsuya pulled some highlights from the list for us here.

44:31.440 --> 44:36.120
Let's see, at the top of the list, Final Fantasy X, followed by Final Fantasy VII, followed

44:36.120 --> 44:39.440
by Dragon Quest III, followed by Dragon Quest VIII.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.720
So the top four were all Squeenix games.

44:41.720 --> 44:48.120
Then we have Machi, followed by Final Fantasy IV, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy III, Dragon

44:48.120 --> 44:50.640
Quest VII, and then Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

44:50.640 --> 44:53.920
So basically half of the top ten were Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games.

44:53.920 --> 44:56.080
And almost all of them are RPGs.

44:56.080 --> 44:57.080
Fuck that.

44:57.080 --> 44:58.080
We're done.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.080
We're that.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.080
Anyway.

45:00.080 --> 45:03.280
Other notable games on the chart, we should point out, Street Fighter II came in at number

45:03.280 --> 45:04.280
20.

45:04.280 --> 45:07.160
The Super Mario Brothers came in at 21.

45:07.160 --> 45:10.440
Final Fantasy VI was in 25.

45:10.440 --> 45:11.440
The fuck?

45:11.440 --> 45:12.440
VI is like one of the best ones.

45:12.440 --> 45:15.160
But Final Fantasy VII has more fandom-y stuff.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
Oh well.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.080
Japan, you screwed that up.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.000
Chrono Trigger, number 28.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.200
Kingdom Hearts II, number 29.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.800
The original Legend of Zelda, 46.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.360
51, Pokemon Red and Green.

45:27.360 --> 45:32.320
And if you want to know where L-Block ended up on the Famitsu list, 96 was where Tetris

45:32.320 --> 45:33.720
Game Boy ended up.

45:33.720 --> 45:34.720
Gradius was on there.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.920
Gradius was 98.

45:35.920 --> 45:37.160
Super Mario Brothers 3 was 99.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.320
I want to know where R-Type is.

45:39.320 --> 45:42.880
Well, you'll just have to pick up this week's Famitsu magazine.

45:42.880 --> 45:45.720
I don't want to go to San Francisco to go buy it.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.720
Okay, you can do your story now.

45:47.720 --> 45:48.720
Okay.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.800
Now again, didn't I say this was going to happen?

45:50.800 --> 45:54.600
And don't get me wrong, I love the technology.

45:54.600 --> 45:57.720
I have one myself built into my PS3.

45:57.720 --> 45:58.720
I love Blu-Ray.

45:58.720 --> 46:03.240
But I also loved Betamax.

46:03.240 --> 46:05.920
And Betamax was far superior to VHS.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.400
I would also like to point out Dark Sakura has an impressive LaserDisc collection.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.720
I do, because I used to go to anime conventions and they'd sell LaserDisc for five bucks a

46:13.720 --> 46:14.720
piece.

46:14.720 --> 46:17.080
So basically, if Dark Sakura likes your media format, you're fucked.

46:17.080 --> 46:19.480
She probably has a collection of 8-tracks somewhere.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.780
LaserDisc did last for a while.

46:21.780 --> 46:25.840
It was the enthusiast format.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.400
You could saw off someone's head with one of those things, too.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.120
Yeah, they were pretty heavy.

46:30.120 --> 46:34.240
What ever happened to VideoDisc?

46:34.240 --> 46:35.240
Can you imagine?

46:35.240 --> 46:37.640
We rented Dumbo on VideoDisc once.

46:37.640 --> 46:38.640
I'll never forget it.

46:38.640 --> 46:41.560
Hey, remember this big plastic-coated...

46:41.560 --> 46:44.960
Yeah, they were like LaserDiscs but in a giant plastic tray.

46:44.960 --> 46:49.460
Hey, can you imagine if they had a Blu-Ray that was the size of a LaserDisc?

46:49.460 --> 46:52.080
How much fucking space you can have on there?

46:52.080 --> 46:54.680
Yeah, that's in the next PlayStation 4.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.040
Yo, what the fuck is this giant slot in here for?

46:57.040 --> 46:58.040
Here's the games!

46:58.040 --> 47:03.080
These are all of our releases for the year!

47:03.080 --> 47:04.260
Enjoy.

47:04.260 --> 47:05.960
That would fucking rock.

47:05.960 --> 47:11.680
I hope PlayStation 4 has those large pizza-sized discs.

47:11.680 --> 47:17.640
I want my next system to be the size of three Atari 5200s.

47:17.640 --> 47:18.640
The end.

47:18.640 --> 47:23.120
I want to weigh as much as ten Xboxes.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.760
I want to have to get a dolly to put this thing in my house.

47:25.760 --> 47:29.760
You know the Xbox is larger than an Atari 5200, but not wider.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.480
Tangent, what were you going to say about Blu-Ray?

47:31.480 --> 47:34.480
Kmart's not selling them anymore, so anyone...

47:34.480 --> 47:42.280
Whatever, you know, no one really shops at Kmart.

47:42.280 --> 47:45.840
I didn't know Kmart was still around.

47:45.840 --> 47:49.480
I love the personal opinion that gets interjected in this show.

47:49.480 --> 47:50.480
Okay, I take that back.

47:50.480 --> 47:51.480
Here's tonight's news.

47:51.480 --> 47:55.760
Kmart pulled Blu-Ray, whatever, no one shops at Kmart.

47:55.760 --> 47:56.840
I take that back.

47:56.840 --> 48:02.480
I did buy pillows at Kmart because they were on sale, and I bought my sheets for my massage

48:02.480 --> 48:05.160
at Kmart, but other than that, no one shops at Kmart.

48:05.160 --> 48:10.140
Okay, I don't know if Kmart's exactly the demographic for Blu-Ray.

48:10.140 --> 48:11.280
That's exactly what I'm saying.

48:11.280 --> 48:15.420
Who thinks, gee, I'm going to go get a Blu-Ray player, where can I get a really good top-of-line

48:15.420 --> 48:18.480
Blu-Ray player that's, I'm going to go to Kmart?

48:18.480 --> 48:22.720
Well, keep in mind, even though Kmart did declare bankruptcy, they did go back and buy

48:22.720 --> 48:25.280
Sears, so...

48:25.280 --> 48:28.760
Okay, if I want an Icee, I'll go to Kmart.

48:28.760 --> 48:33.040
I go there to buy sheets from my massage table, and that's about it.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.880
Or if, heaven forbid, I want something from the Martha Stewart collection, I'll go to

48:35.880 --> 48:36.880
Kmart.

48:36.880 --> 48:37.880
My pillows.

48:37.880 --> 48:39.240
Or if I want to go laugh at the poor people.

48:39.240 --> 48:41.280
Just kidding.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.280
I'm among you.

48:42.280 --> 48:44.780
And Rama is yelling in chat, hey, damn it.

48:44.780 --> 48:46.200
I shop at Kmart.

48:46.200 --> 48:49.980
Raven's Dolphin says, shit, I shop at Kmart.

48:49.980 --> 48:55.040
Much like I go back to the conversation we had in part A, where I said, LARPing, something

48:55.040 --> 49:00.000
you don't really want to admit to.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
You know what?

49:01.000 --> 49:04.680
Here's the reason why I don't, okay, here's the reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore,

49:04.680 --> 49:05.680
even though this isn't supposed to be an Instagram podcast.

49:05.680 --> 49:06.680
Dude, they have little Caesars.

49:06.680 --> 49:07.680
Okay.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.680
That's why I shop at Kmart.

49:08.680 --> 49:15.920
Actually, I do also sometimes buy my DVR discs for my camera.

49:15.920 --> 49:17.320
Okay, here's the thing.

49:17.320 --> 49:21.680
I used to, my fondest memories of going to Kmart, going shopping were in the 80s.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.800
Like we used to go, you know, it'd be like a big department store trip day, we're going

49:24.800 --> 49:25.800
to go to Kmart.

49:25.800 --> 49:26.800
Here's the problem.

49:26.800 --> 49:30.040
There's a reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore, because the store hasn't fucking

49:30.040 --> 49:33.840
changed a thing since the 80s, besides what's on the shelves.

49:33.840 --> 49:36.520
No, not even the clothes.

49:36.520 --> 49:37.520
Except.

49:37.520 --> 49:38.520
Yes.

49:38.520 --> 49:43.720
I did find a cute sweater there, but it also was like one of those 80s revival styles.

49:43.720 --> 49:47.080
I think I saw some underwear for sale that was actually from the 80s.

49:47.080 --> 49:49.620
I bought socks.

49:49.620 --> 49:54.000
You can buy socks at Kmart, because socks, you know, are socks.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.440
I think they actually still have those doors that you have to like step on the mat where

49:58.440 --> 50:02.680
it triggers the door before infrared technology or something like that.

50:02.680 --> 50:05.080
Okay, can we move on before we get the hate mail from Kmart?

50:05.080 --> 50:07.880
Okay, they're not carrying Blu-ray players anymore, so whatever.

50:07.880 --> 50:11.520
Yeah, the hate mail from that one Kmart person.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
Okay.

50:12.520 --> 50:17.800
Anyways, here's some exciting news, and I'm going to say this is very specific.

50:17.800 --> 50:19.080
It has nothing to do with Kmart.

50:19.080 --> 50:20.840
It has nothing to do with Kmart.

50:20.840 --> 50:25.320
LucasArts and Bioware are teaming up for something.

50:25.320 --> 50:28.360
Yes, that's right.

50:28.360 --> 50:32.340
They're working on an undisclosed interactive entertainment product.

50:32.340 --> 50:34.440
But it's LucasArts and Bioware, so what else do we know?

50:34.440 --> 50:35.440
It's going to be awesome.

50:35.440 --> 50:37.600
It's going to be like Knights of the Old Republic or something like that.

50:37.600 --> 50:41.000
It's Knights of the Old Indiana Jones Republic, that's right.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.680
I feel the need to say something nice about Kmart now.

50:45.680 --> 50:50.480
They do carry the Diet Cranberry Serumist.

50:50.480 --> 50:54.200
I will pre-order the LucasArts Bioware game at Kmart, no I won't.

50:54.200 --> 50:57.840
But I will tell you one thing that Kmart is good for.

50:57.840 --> 51:04.800
They don't care about street dates because that's where I got Serenity like two weeks

51:04.800 --> 51:08.160
before it came out and I got it as an early Christmas gift for Xtrafer and he was all

51:08.160 --> 51:11.560
excited because he had Serenity on DVD for any of his friends.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.600
I'm sorry, LucasArts?

51:13.600 --> 51:15.600
They're making something.

51:15.600 --> 51:16.600
Okay.

51:16.600 --> 51:17.600
Hooray!

51:17.600 --> 51:24.160
Rumors, rumors, rumors, and this rumor has something to do with Oblivion, that's right,

51:24.160 --> 51:27.800
The Elder Scrolls Oblivion, the game that just won't stay out in the news.

51:27.800 --> 51:33.360
This game has been making headlines since it came out and now it should be noted that

51:33.360 --> 51:38.800
the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, that's ZeniMax Media, has registered the domain

51:38.800 --> 51:42.800
name Elderscrollsonline.com.

51:42.800 --> 51:43.800
Oh my God!

51:43.800 --> 51:45.260
A website.

51:45.260 --> 51:50.360
Could this mean that Elder Scrolls Oblivion could make its way online, be an MMO?

51:50.360 --> 51:54.040
Hell, somebody already hacked the game to do this on the PC version.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.640
Could this be a further way to milk the Oblivion franchise?

51:56.640 --> 51:57.640
Who knows?

51:57.640 --> 51:59.360
It could give World of Warcraft a run for their money.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.360
Puppy, how many hours have you spent on Oblivion?

52:01.360 --> 52:02.360
A lot.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.360
A lot.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.360
Let's leave a lot, right?

52:04.360 --> 52:06.280
A lot in a two week span of time, yes.

52:06.280 --> 52:07.840
So what would you think of this?

52:07.840 --> 52:11.880
If there was an Oblivion online, would you play it or is this jumping the shark?

52:11.880 --> 52:12.880
I don't know.

52:12.880 --> 52:19.720
It would, with as much, you'll play it, characterization and customization there is, I don't know.

52:19.720 --> 52:25.180
They would have to do a lot to expand the world because running around in the worlds

52:25.180 --> 52:30.640
in Oblivion, it's like running, running, running, running, tree, rock, tree, rock, oh look a

52:30.640 --> 52:35.280
rabbit run, run, run, run, run, run, oh look, hey look, a dungeon, we're going to be punching

52:35.280 --> 52:41.240
horses online, in the face, a sheep tossing contest would be fun, good times.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.560
Yeah, but you know what it doesn't have?

52:43.560 --> 52:46.300
You can't kick bugs in the face.

52:46.300 --> 52:47.880
You can kick sheep in the face, probably.

52:47.880 --> 52:48.880
They're big enough to kick.

52:48.880 --> 52:51.680
You can't kick bees in the face.

52:51.680 --> 52:55.880
You can't, Aragorondo.

52:55.880 --> 52:59.280
Sorry, I'm looking at chat right now.

52:59.280 --> 53:02.560
I got to go back to the Kmart thing because this shit's funny.

53:02.560 --> 53:10.920
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Kmart still sells Rockus Dukakis shirts.

53:10.920 --> 53:16.000
Hilarity.

53:16.000 --> 53:23.640
Robwood2B says, I go to Kmart to trip over stuff in the aisles.

53:23.640 --> 53:24.880
Blue Light Special.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.880
Okay, anyway, sorry.

53:26.880 --> 53:32.040
Okay, so Elder Scrolls may be online, at least if recent domain names are to be believed.

53:32.040 --> 53:38.360
Skypline is opening soon, you can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our user name on Skype

53:38.360 --> 53:39.720
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

53:39.720 --> 53:43.320
We have a couple more stories before we get there, right Jamie?

53:43.320 --> 53:48.040
Yes, if someone would stop hogging the mic, puppy.

53:48.040 --> 53:55.440
You know, you're no longer a foreign correspondent, you live in my town now.

53:55.440 --> 53:57.480
You can be our resident puppy.

53:57.480 --> 53:59.040
Video game story.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.040
Hey Rob, guess what?

54:01.040 --> 54:02.040
What?

54:02.040 --> 54:03.040
Kmart.

54:03.040 --> 54:08.160
Okay, so Namco Bandai, dun dun dun.

54:08.160 --> 54:11.940
I agree with Misty, why would you want to kick a bee in the face anyway?

54:11.940 --> 54:15.520
Just because it's the act of kicking a bee in the face.

54:15.520 --> 54:21.240
Oh, well shit, I'm so sorry.

54:21.240 --> 54:24.240
Just because it's the novelty.

54:24.240 --> 54:25.720
How dare I?

54:25.720 --> 54:26.720
What?

54:26.720 --> 54:30.120
I don't know, Loki, you're just like, you're looking patient over there like, I want this

54:30.120 --> 54:31.120
show to finish.

54:31.120 --> 54:34.400
No, he's watching that video again.

54:34.400 --> 54:37.040
I'm not watching that video again.

54:37.040 --> 54:38.040
Okay.

54:38.040 --> 54:39.040
Namco Bandai.

54:39.040 --> 54:40.040
Yes, Namco Bandai.

54:40.040 --> 54:47.720
I have announced a Wii exclusive, Soul Calibur Legends, which is very, very happy.

54:47.720 --> 54:51.760
We will have everybody so far, hopefully new people.

54:51.760 --> 54:55.040
Wait, I think we're getting some late breaking news, Rob.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.040
Oh yes, oh sorry.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.040
Late breaking news.

54:57.040 --> 55:06.440
I'm sorry, here's...

55:06.440 --> 55:10.440
We go to our correspondent, Loki, live in the OLR studio with late breaking news.

55:10.440 --> 55:16.440
Yes, apparently the reaction to Soul Calibur Legends going gold is, what could he do?

55:16.440 --> 55:18.000
Who gives a fuck?

55:18.000 --> 55:19.360
It's going to be crappy anyways.

55:19.360 --> 55:26.720
Hey, did anyone remember, what was that, that stupid game with, it's like a spinoff of Tekken?

55:26.720 --> 55:29.920
God, I've blocked it from my brain, but...

55:29.920 --> 55:32.760
Oh, the one that had Nina, it starred Nina, didn't it?

55:32.760 --> 55:33.760
Yeah.

55:33.760 --> 55:34.760
Yeah.

55:34.760 --> 55:35.760
Yeah, Death by Degrees.

55:35.760 --> 55:36.760
Thank you.

55:36.760 --> 55:37.760
Death by Degrees.

55:37.760 --> 55:38.760
Yeah, yeah.

55:38.760 --> 55:39.760
That's this game all over again.

55:39.760 --> 55:40.760
Yeah.

55:40.760 --> 55:45.240
Ivy, Death by Degrees.

55:45.240 --> 55:46.240
No.

55:46.240 --> 55:47.240
But will she have the whip?

55:47.240 --> 55:48.240
That's all we need to know.

55:48.240 --> 55:52.560
I actually kind of wanted Death by Degrees just because of me being a big Tekken nerd.

55:52.560 --> 55:56.720
I even have this, okay, I even have the dumb Tekken game that was on Wonderswan.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.640
That's pretty sad.

55:58.640 --> 55:59.640
It was like Tekken Kart.

55:59.640 --> 56:01.800
That's like buying Tekken on your cell phone.

56:01.800 --> 56:02.800
Alright.

56:02.800 --> 56:05.560
Does it come on cell phone?

56:05.560 --> 56:09.840
Quick, another story, then the Skype line.

56:09.840 --> 56:12.640
Anyways, um, yes.

56:12.640 --> 56:19.820
So this totally, I don't know, perpetuates all those stereotypes of Halo 3 players.

56:19.820 --> 56:26.480
Apparently a child assaulted his mother and attacked the police because he was ordered

56:26.480 --> 56:31.120
to stop playing Halo 3, which right there, you had it coming.

56:31.120 --> 56:35.040
I mean, seriously, you're making your child play a mature rated game, or I should say

56:35.040 --> 56:38.000
you're allowing your child to play a mature rated game.

56:38.000 --> 56:45.000
Um, the trouble began when the youth was told by his mother to turn off his Xbox 360 as

56:45.000 --> 56:46.520
it was getting late.

56:46.520 --> 56:51.520
After he refused, his mother took his AirCard, which is apparently an adapter you can use

56:51.520 --> 56:57.040
for your cell phone to get Wi-Fi, from the 360, preventing him from playing online and

56:57.040 --> 57:01.800
prompting a fit of rage that would see the child frantically search through the house

57:01.800 --> 57:05.540
before punching his mom in the face.

57:05.540 --> 57:10.880
The kid then retreated to his room, but soon had to deal with the local sheriff deputies

57:10.880 --> 57:14.480
who his mom had called following the assault.

57:14.480 --> 57:20.880
Deputies entered his room using a key kept by the mother, but also fell foul to the youth's

57:20.880 --> 57:21.880
rage.

57:21.880 --> 57:26.460
He managed to punch one of the deputies square in the face, which then he was restrained

57:26.460 --> 57:27.460
and handcuffed.

57:27.460 --> 57:32.480
He would later be turned over to the state juvenile authorities of charges of battery

57:32.480 --> 57:37.560
hunting domestic violence and battery on a law enforcement officer.

57:37.560 --> 57:43.520
God, kids these days.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.200
Kids do the darndest things.

57:45.200 --> 57:52.160
But now I can just imagine people on Halo yelling, oh you stupid mother puncher!

57:52.160 --> 57:57.720
Well dude this is stupid anyways, I mean your fucking kid is like playing Halo and it's

57:57.720 --> 57:59.160
a mature rated game.

57:59.160 --> 58:02.520
Oh my god, it must be the violence of the game that caused him to punch his mom in the

58:02.520 --> 58:03.520
face.

58:03.520 --> 58:10.000
What I really want to know is what have they been doing to their child up to that point

58:10.000 --> 58:14.440
that they would have a violent reaction or maybe their child already had psychological

58:14.440 --> 58:15.440
problems.

58:15.440 --> 58:16.440
You know.

58:16.440 --> 58:19.440
Took them to Kmart.

58:19.440 --> 58:25.120
Here's our new O.L.R. in joke.

58:25.120 --> 58:26.120
We have Kmart.

58:26.120 --> 58:28.120
Hey Timmy, it's Disneyland.

58:28.120 --> 58:29.840
This is Kmart.

58:29.840 --> 58:30.840
No it's Disneyland.

58:30.840 --> 58:31.840
Kmart.

58:31.840 --> 58:32.840
No Disneyland.

58:32.840 --> 58:33.840
Go play.

58:33.840 --> 58:41.320
But it seems to me that there had to have been a pre-existing problem for their child

58:41.320 --> 58:47.560
to react that way because I have seen children play Halo 3 and been just fine and not want

58:47.560 --> 58:52.040
to punch anybody when their parents said, okay we can't play on Dan's Xbox anymore.

58:52.040 --> 58:58.720
But mom, I was fragging some fucking noobs.

58:58.720 --> 59:07.040
You know, Dan's little, his cousin's kid comes over and plays games at our house sometimes.

59:07.040 --> 59:09.120
And has he ever punched you in the face?

59:09.120 --> 59:10.720
No.

59:10.720 --> 59:12.640
He's always been well behaved.

59:12.640 --> 59:15.620
That's because his parents teach him right.

59:15.620 --> 59:18.800
I think it's a fault with the parents but I do think it's good that she did call, you

59:18.800 --> 59:25.560
know, have him actually, you know, stand accountable for what he did.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.160
Shadow Charlie asks, how old was this kid?

59:28.160 --> 59:31.800
The age and name were withheld.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.600
I heard he was just 15 or something like that.

59:35.600 --> 59:38.640
I heard, you suck.

59:38.640 --> 59:41.560
Oh, your mom.

59:41.560 --> 59:47.520
It was some Florida kid.

59:47.520 --> 59:50.080
Indian River County website.

59:50.080 --> 59:54.360
They have a website for Indian River County for Florida.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.640
Where to stay, where to dine, what to do.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:01.640
Discover our lifestyle choices including dying with pictures of old people on a golf course

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:04.320
and on a beach and in a dining room.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320
Dying.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.320
Sorry.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.320
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.280
All right, let's open up the Skype line.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.480
If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:23.680
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio and you can comment on any of tonight's stories or you can make

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.680
a Kmart joke.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.680
I don't really care.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.720
Tonight, after tonight's show, I'm like crying from laughing so hard.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.720
It's not that funny.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.640
I know I'm going to be listening to this show like in the car later so I'm going to go,

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.760
this show really wasn't that funny.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:35.960
Why were you laughing so much?

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.760
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.320
It's the Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.000
Hi, Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.280
Did you just get back from Kmart?

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.920
Yes, I just got back from Kmart and guess what, there is no blue-way players.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.480
All right, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.480
Mario Galaxy.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.480
That's what's on my mind.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.560
Ah, yes, you are Mr. Gay is Mario Galaxy.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.640
I know, but let's not go there.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.680
All right, what about Mario Galaxy?

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:07.360
Did you realize that the, I know Jamie said that she's getting a retail copy at her store

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:11.320
so I actually got the chance to play it at a GameStop.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.360
And what did you think, young man?

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.680
I think the game looked great.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.920
I love the controls.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.040
I think the game just looked great.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:24.640
I mean, well, the game was on HGTV so it left a lot to be desired, which was a little sad,

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.160
a little sad about that, but the controls were great.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.120
Everything was great about it.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.280
Is this a game the kids across the country are going to be craving come this Christmas

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280
season?

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.880
Craving, they're going to be dying for it.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:39.200
You're going to be shooting each other like they were PS3s?

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.200
I don't know.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.040
Well, I mean, you know, if you want to get the game, just never mind.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.720
I was going to make a joke, but I'm beating that joke on the ground.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.720
So Super Mario Galaxy, so awesome.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.120
You'll punch your mother in the face just to play some more.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.120
Is it?

01:01:58.120 --> 01:01:59.120
Yeah.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.120
Is the game that great?

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.120
Is it worth punching your mom in the face over?

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.880
I think so.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.560
Let's go ahead and call his mom so that we know to hide what your child is saying.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.160
All right.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.280
What else did you call in to tell us about Ravenstaufen?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.840
You just wanted to say that Mario Galaxy is cool?

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.320
Mario Galaxy and Phoenix, sorry, Charles and Turb about is very good.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.320
Music's phenomenal.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.880
You know Shane, who used to guest on this show a lot before he moved back to Kansas?

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.640
We have a Ventrilo server for World of Warcraft slash Final Fantasy XI, basically.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.400
Be careful on those.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.400
Yeah.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.400
No, I want Ventrilo harassment guy to sign on to our Ventrilo.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.080
I'm like, roll out the fucking red carpet for him.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.960
I think that guy's fucking hilarious.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.720
But anyway, I would be so honored if he came on and I'd be like, yay, it's Ventrilo harassment

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:48.720
guy.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:54.280
Anyway, the thing about Shane though is that he has been signing on to Ventrilo this week

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.560
and we're like, Shane, where are you?

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.840
You're not in WoW and you're not playing Final Fantasy XI either.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.560
He's like, oh, I'm playing Phoenix, right?

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560
Right.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.640
We're like, why are you signed on to Vent?

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.640
He's like, I don't know.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:05.960
I just, you know, I'm playing Phoenix, right?

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.960
I just thought I'd say hello.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.560
It's like, okay, I got to go.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560
I got a case.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.560
You know what I need to do?

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.560
What?

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.320
I need to play Guild Wars and Ragnarok at the same time.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320
At the same time?

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320
At the same time.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.320
That'd be pretty hardcore.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.320
All right.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.320
One more thing.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.840
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Ravensdolvin?

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.840
One more, one more.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.440
You were talking about Count Ducula and all those good shows that's coming back.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.440
Fuck yeah, we were.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.960
I would love to see a Count Ducula show.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.000
I mean, you know, we've been doing, I've been doing this experimental podcast called the

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Cartoon Cast.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.680
So we've been talking about Count Ducula and showing old cartoons like that.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.400
So I would love to see a Count Ducula game.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400
Who wouldn't?

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
Me.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400
This is my favorite part.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.840
I would not like to see a Count Ducula game.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.960
Why?

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.480
Because the show's been off the air for years.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.960
Okay, so Dragon Ball Z's been off the air for years.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.500
Why are we still getting games?

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.500
Because Atari, that's all it got.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.500
Well, you know what?

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.680
They probably still show episodes of it on the Kmart TVs.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.680
Okay?

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:07.920
Look, I've seen episodes of Count Ducula on TV a while back, but that's what the internet's

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.920
for, right?

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920
Exactly.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:10.920
That and porn.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:11.920
We've got YouTube.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:12.920
All right.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.920
That's amazing.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.920
Is that it then, Ravenstaufen?

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.920
That is it.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920
Thank you for taking my call.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.920
You are most welcome, sir.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.920
Have a great week.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.920
All right.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:21.920
Wow, he hung up on himself.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.280
I didn't even click the button.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.560
If you want to give us a call or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, or our phone

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.240
number 1-877-GAME-OLR, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240
Who's this?

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.080
Oh, it's truly Legend of Zaku.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.400
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:37.400
What's on your mind?

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.400
Um, nothing.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:44.320
Don't mind me for the fact that this girl just helped me a short while ago.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.480
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:46.480
I am.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.200
But yeah, I guess, you know- Whiskey makes it all better.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.200
Jamie.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200
What?

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.880
Manhunt 2, you know, that whole controversy, that whole clusterfuck that rocks our man

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880
to shove some beer.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880
Okay, seriously?

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.880
I got to stop you right here, okay?

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.180
After breaking up with your girlfriend, I would not recommend playing Manhunt 2.

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.320
That's going to give you a totally bad idea.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.960
I'm not going to, I'm not homicidal, all right?

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.200
I've played Doom since I was like, what, 11?

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:19.160
So yeah, I guess, I don't know, I don't get why, you know, why companies like Rockstar

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:25.200
just, you know, they try to half-ass their way by just covering up stuff, you know, covering

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:31.800
up, you know, bits that were thrown back when the ASRP told them to, and all of a sudden,

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:37.880
you know, hackers find a way to make us gamers look bad, to make the industry look bad.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:42.000
You know, and it was just, honestly, when they said, oh, we're going to mask this stuff,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.800
that was just an open invite to the hackers to say, find out how we mask this and unmask

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800
it.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.760
I mean, I know, I know, you know, I can understand that, you know, that the rating, you know,

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:57.120
the rating board actually, you know, knew about the content that was blurred out.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.480
But wouldn't it make more sense not to, you know, not to give, not to give ammunition

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:08.920
to, you know, to the critics, to anyone who's out to get people like Rockstar for the fact

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.960
that they get called out on stuff that was, you know, that was supposedly rejected before

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:19.280
but it's still in the game, just not seen, kind of like the whole hot coffee thing where,

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.520
you know, it still shouldn't, you know, still shouldn't have been on the disk in the first

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520
place.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:30.920
And they should have learned, not hiding, not obscuring it from, you know, from the

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:37.400
ratings board, not doing that, but just not having the common sense to not keep, you know,

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.480
to keep it out of the disk in the first place.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.680
I don't, you know, so be it, you have to recreate the build but, you know, and that shit happens

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.640
in our job.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.200
You know what just occurred to me because we were talking about Oblivion a little bit

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:52.720
ago?

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.800
This is very strange.

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.520
It just occurred to me.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:01.540
Did they not make Bethesda go back and re-rate Oblivion because somebody found a way to hack

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:04.800
the game so that the girl's top could come off and you could have boobies?

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.960
But you also have to understand.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.600
Isn't this the same fucking thing?

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:17.840
You also have to understand that we don't know whether or not that company submitted

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:23.680
all the assets for the characters for the ratings board.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.920
Okay yeah yeah yeah but hold on I just had an epiphany with this whole thing.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.920
I mean totally.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920
Wait a minute.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920
I just owned ESRB.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.280
No no no no you didn't and here's why.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.720
It's because that was on the PC that they did the mod.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:42.520
The mods on PC's are fairly available whereas a PSP version the hack it means you have to

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.440
have an illegitimate copy of the game.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.200
But still it's on principle.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.040
What a fucking great line we are walking.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.760
It shouldn't have been on the dead score on the actual game.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.280
It's fucking boobies too.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.560
I think they should have just taken the AO rating.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.520
Honestly I think the problem is is that the AO rating is the kiss of death.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520
It's the same problem.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.440
No the problem is that the AO rating means that your game does not get published for

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.240
the PlayStation 2, the Wii, or the PSP.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.240
And that's the problem.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.240
That's the problem.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.040
You only get limited to one platform and but that's the other thing you have to understand

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.520
is that legislators right now they want to push bills that will add more you know quote

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:27.060
unquote truth in the ratings basically trying to you know find a way you know to call people

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:32.960
out for mods even though you know even if it wasn't there wasn't you know the responsibility

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:39.280
of the game the publisher I mean of the designer itself just for the fact that you know it

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:45.720
shouldn't it shouldn't give people shouldn't give hackers or any folks like that the tools

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.800
to create that much controversy to give them a channel.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:54.380
All right I'm going to agree with Fursby in our chat room on that who says it's just fucking

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.000
pixels and I agree.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.760
It's pixels but then it's something that the human you know the human brain could translate

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.760
as boobs.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.960
Well let's also realize that the legislators making these decisions and trying to get all

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:12.280
this stuff done they're like generations behind us.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:18.320
Yeah they're only they're only outscored political points you know the bill bills fake DDP Dan

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.960
that's it all they care about is keeping their seat.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.880
Yeah once they die off and go away we'll get some smarter people in there and we're thinking

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880
better.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880
All right.

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.120
But then we're going to run into the same complaints.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.260
Zaku I gotta let you go because we're going on five minutes of this call we gotta get

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:35.080
some more calls but thank you for your perspective.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:39.480
We appreciate it as always and sorry to hear about the girl there's plenty of fish in the

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480
sea Zaku.

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.480
I'm right.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480
You'll find one.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.480
All right.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:48.160
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on skype orange launch radio hi

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.760
you're on orange launch radio who's this?

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.960
Hey this is Rob with two B's.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.880
Wow Rob with two B's how you doing sir?

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.840
Yeah I'm doing fine I just decided to call in because it was too long to write in chat.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:03.520
I was going to say I think we hear from you a lot on email and totally appreciate it but

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.160
I think this might be the first time I can recall you calling into the show.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:09.080
It is the first time.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:14.440
Well congratulations on making the great crossover from the written form to the verbal form.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.440
It's good to hear from you.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.800
What's on your mind?

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.400
VG Expo was this weekend.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:27.160
That's right the America's VG Expo in Philly and didn't they actually got Jack Thompson

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.560
to go to their show didn't they?

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.120
They did and from what I've heard it was civil which is surprising.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.120
Interesting.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.280
Sorry I just said the forbidden phrase on the show my bad.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.240
Especially since the man is near rabid.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.040
Anyway what you want to say about America's VG Expo did you go Rob?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.600
Yeah I went on Saturday it really is only worth a day trip if you live in the area.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:53.200
It was in Philadelphia Convention Center which is downtown about 10 minutes from the airport

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.680
and I hate to admit it but it was a better location.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:06.440
They had the Rock Band Tour, they had the Dell Intel Hi-Def Tour, I'm trying to remember

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:14.160
they had a few contests on Guitar Hero and alright that's all I can remember.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.160
Sounds like there was a lot to see.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.480
It sounds like it was E for All.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:24.360
No I didn't go to E for All but you get done with things fast there.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:31.800
Plus they didn't have much on the forums or anything.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:38.840
Basically on the day I was there they had the journalists forum, they had the moral

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:46.040
combat movie, they had their Jack Thompson panel and they had something I skipped the

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:49.600
Postal 2 preview.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.600
Sounds skippable.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:57.280
I want to make it short so anybody who didn't go can understand what went on.

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.920
The Game Journalist Interviews is always a good one and nobody goes to it.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.060
Gosh I can't remember the names of the people.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.440
What kind of game journalists were they?

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.880
Were they independent folks like us that do podcasting or were we talking folks from Game

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.520
Spot, One Up type people?

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:20.640
Yes we had one from One Up, one from Game Stop, not Game Stop, EGM I'm sorry the original

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:27.000
editor of EGM when it was spelled out.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:35.320
They had the director of marketing for Ziff Davis and he was really informative.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:40.560
To make a long story short the best thing he said was if you want to be a game journalist

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:47.480
you should, he said this because it's in their own company, you should blog on One Up and

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.680
make reviews less than 90 words.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.680
Wait

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.680
That's the best way to get noticed.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:59.680
If you want to be a game journalist you should get reviews that are less than 90 words?

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.680
Yes

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.080
You're as sure as sucks.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:12.960
It takes at least 10 more words to get your mom on mother of the year nominations.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.680
Really really really really really really really really sucks.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:18.880
Okay here we go here we go.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:24.800
No I got it, Yaris, at least it's not ET on the Atari 2600.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.440
Yeah we can't actually bury it.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:33.680
Okay here we go here we go, Yaris, sucks, would rather have gone to Kmart.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:40.920
The sound you hear is a dead horse being beaten over and over again in the studio.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.960
Okay well the the Mortal Kombat movie is very good it could make you motion sick because

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:53.000
they have a really long quake sequence in there and it's a lot of video game graphics

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.960
running in the background while the interviews are going on.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.720
It's actually in my opinion is too much video game graphics but they do some really funny

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.960
transitions so it's worth a it's worth a listen.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.800
It leaves the gray area gray.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:16.360
And then the Jack Thompson and the guy he was sparring against was Lorne Lanning of

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:24.520
who helped to co-created Oddworld Inhabitants and they were they were sparring off and Jack

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:31.080
was funny and he was civil and you know I really hate you know I don't have any dirt

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.440
on him he was he was very smart.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.800
Well he knew he was in enemy territory I mean you know yeah he probably went back onto the

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.960
game politics put comment forums a couple hours later and started slandering.

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.280
They all smelled like ass.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:51.640
I know his comments on game politics are really like personality too.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:56.000
Well Rob we can oh yeah go ahead oh Lorne pretty much lost the interview because he

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.160
got emotional and he and he started attacking Jackie Pooh's character which was really a

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.960
mistake and you know it doesn't matter who won it doesn't change my opinion.

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.680
I agree it's just one debate he may have won the battle but he hasn't won the war.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.120
And you should have seen they made us go through the security check.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.120
Good times.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.080
Well Rob we got to let you go but we we really appreciate the call talking about the VG Expo

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:27.120
which we all forgot happened so I'm glad somebody was there to remind us all righty.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.560
Well I only live like 90 minutes from it so.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.040
Nice well glad to hear you had a good time and hope to hear from you in the future don't

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.040
be a stranger.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:35.040
All right see ya.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040
Take care buddy.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.040
Thanks.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.000
I feel bad because I'm making our callers wrap it up but you know we got I know there's

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:47.080
still a bunch of people that want to call in so we'll take maybe two more calls 1-877-GAME-OLR

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:55.760
or our username on skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.080
I will open it up for some oh never mind we're getting a call.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:04.520
Hi on orange launch radio who's this?

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.920
Hi you are on orange launch radio who's this?

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.920
We cannot hear you.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:12.920
Hola bienvenidos a orange launch radio.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920
Quienes.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.560
Did you say Guiness?

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:24.040
What the crap is hi hi hi were you not expecting to get through?

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.880
No I didn't plug my mic in.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.040
Oh well good job DMN.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.080
Well hi DMN what's on your mind now that we can actually hear you?

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.800
I am actually calling in response to one of the long emails dark sakura or soccer sorry

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.760
had about Nintendo and ignorance and the Nintendo 64.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.960
Goody goody what do you have to say?

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:52.000
Do any of you have any idea as to why Nintendo is still around?

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.040
Mario no handheld.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.920
Because of their involvement still in the Hanafuda card business.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.080
That's exactly it Jamie no Pokemon.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:13.600
That game has sold well over 14 to 15 million copies and that's just the originals alone.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.920
That's the reason why Nintendo is still in business.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:21.660
Had that game not have sold on America's Nintendo would be kaput.

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:28.800
So the Nintendo 64 tanked let's all admit that it tanked it wasn't that great a system.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:33.240
Nintendo lost a lot of money on it and they didn't do that great on the gamecube either.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:37.600
They're just now rebounding back with the DS and the Wii.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:44.560
So saying that you know the Nintendo 64 kept it in their forum no.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.560
Did it have games I personally enjoyed yes but I don't think it was that successful of

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560
a system.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.000
We threw two bees our last caller's back in chat and says Nintendo sells at profit that's

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.800
why they're still around.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:01.440
That too I mean the gamecube from its inception sold profit the Wii since its inception has

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:08.600
sold at profit the DS even if both models have sold at profit.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:13.720
So Nintendo has knows what they're doing with hardware that's why they're still in it.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:20.320
And like I said earlier Pokemon snap is the shit so you know Pokemon for the win.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:26.240
Alright any other thoughts for our listeners tonight DMN?

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:32.680
Oh man oh Guitar Hero 3 massively multiplayer thon that I talked about on my show I want

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.040
to pitch that really quick.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040
What's this?

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:41.600
If you are an OLR fanboy listener on air talent get together on Xbox live or on a Nintendo

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:48.160
Wi-Fi connection this Saturday I believe it's November the 9th and get together play with

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:53.320
some fellow OLR listeners and have some fun because Guitar Hero 3 is a very fun game especially

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.660
on multiplayer this time around.

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:57.560
Or you could join our band on the website.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:00.120
That too I did I joined it like just now.

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:05.560
Oh I see your request I'm going to go in and approve it right now.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.920
I'm working on that right now as we talk.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.000
He's clicking on the red x-rays.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I am.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.040
Okay and now I'm going to click on the button that hangs up on you okay?

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040
Okay.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.840
Bye friend!

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.280
Alright let's get some last minute stories.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:22.000
What's going on over to Loki with any last minute stories?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.920
Oh Dark Sakura has one why don't you start us off then?

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.920
I do have one.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:31.640
Do you remember how they were talking about the PS3 to help with the folding protein models?

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:37.640
Actually it did make the Guinness Book of World Records and they're saying that since

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:48.320
the project started they've been using 670,000 PlayStation 3s at they were actually according

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:55.240
to this it says the FAH is now the most powerful distributed computing network ever at over

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:56.240
a petaflop.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:01.800
That sounds like something that would be on Dateline NBC a petaflop.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:07.080
It's over 250 teraflops which is a trillion calculations per second.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:14.440
So, they have been using the PS3 as a computer and the whole point of the folding project

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:21.400
is basically to look how proteins fold because they have evidence to show that proteins that

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:27.280
don't fold properly are related to Alzheimer's and other diseases.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.120
The amazing things being accomplished with the PlayStation 3 what can we say?

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:36.120
And Rob with Two Bees asks in chat what's a microflop then?

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.360
That would be this episode.

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.400
Good point.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.960
We're getting another call on the Skype line.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.960
Let's go take it.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.960
Hello.

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960
You are on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.960
Who's this?

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.960
Hello.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:48.960
It's Rice Princess.

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:49.960
Hi Rice Princess.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960
You're not here.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960
You're supposed to be here in studio tonight.

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.960
I totally was.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960
I'm sorry.

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.960
What gives?

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960
I have a flat tire.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960
Fired.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960
I know.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960
I'm sorry.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.960
Too cute.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:00.960
All right.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.120
Well, what's on your mind and put the mic a little closer to your mouth because you're

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.120
barely coming in.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.120
This better.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120
Oh my gosh.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120
Is it louder?

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120
Jesus Christ.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.120
Yes.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:12.120
All right.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120
Okay.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.120
Much better.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:15.120
What's on your mind?

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.120
What do you want to comment on tonight?

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.120
Oh, I don't know.

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.120
You told me to call in.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.840
I told you to call in because you weren't here in person.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.920
I just wanted to break you over the phone.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920
Oh, okay.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.920
Shame on you.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.280
Well, what have you been playing lately?

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.280
Anything?

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:32.640
I haven't been doing much game playing for the past couple of weeks.

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.560
You haven't been playing a lot of WoW or anything?

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.560
Not really.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.560
Oh.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.560
Well, gee.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.480
A video game podcaster does you a lot of good this week, doesn't it?

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480
Doesn't it though?

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480
My gosh.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.880
I've been playing so little.

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.400
Like it's kind of pointless for me to be calling in.

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.400
All right.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.400
Well, then I'll hang up on you.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.400
What?

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.400
I'll hang up on you then.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.400
Hey, jerk.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.400
You told me to call in.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.400
Well, because I thought you'd want to say hi because you weren't here in person.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.400
Oh, well, hi.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.400
All right.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.400
Bye.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.400
All right.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400
1-877.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:04.400
I'm going to get spanked for that one later.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.800
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.160
Loki, got anything for us real quick?

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.240
We'll take one more call.

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:17.120
Circuit City is offering a pretty cool deal for people that purchase Call of Duty 4.

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.120
Yay, Call of Duty 3 for free.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.120
That's for...

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.200
Because you probably already own it.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.200
Hey, it's free.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.360
Because you wouldn't want to play it.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:31.360
It's free and also been leaked to the internet from what I've seen.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:38.200
Sensible Soccer or Sensible World of Soccer is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:44.120
this month, also coming out on the PSC.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.120
That's neat.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.120
Maybe.

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.120
You said the game is how old?

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.720
We're getting another call on Skype.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.280
Let's go take that and then we'll get to any more last minute stories.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.280
This will be our last call tonight.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280
Who's this?

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.280
Hey, it's ShadowNextGen.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.920
Hello, ShadowNextGen.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:58.920
What's on your mind?

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.160
How's it going?

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:02.480
Pretty good.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:04.960
What did you want to talk about tonight?

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.840
E for All, briefly, because I was there.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.160
How was E for All?

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.640
E for All, despite a lot of the internet reports, was actually a lot of fun.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.200
There was a lot of games to play.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.880
I mean, obviously, Microsoft and Sony weren't there and those were the big omissions, but

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:30.200
Metal Gear Solid 4, Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers, Contra 4, Call of Duty 4, Simpsons.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.800
There was Guitar Hero 3, Rock Band.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.720
There was quite a lot of games there to play.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.440
The biggest complaint I heard about E for All was very similar to what Rob had just

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:41.920
said about Video Game Expo and that is you could have done it all in a day.

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.520
Is that true?

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.280
You probably could have, but I mean, I was there for the whole time.

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:52.120
There was also the Video Game Live concert that I went to that was a lot of fun as well.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.120
Nice.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.120
Sounds like fun.

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:56.540
That was right across the street from E for All.

01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:00.880
Did you wait in line for Super Smash Brothers?

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:06.320
I didn't have to because I got in early, so I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:07.320
Nice.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.320
How was it?

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.160
Super Smash Brothers was a lot of fun.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:16.280
I believe I played as Link and they had a level from Twilight Princess in there.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:22.440
They had the bridge level where you're jousting with that big enemy on the Warthog.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.880
So it was a lot of fun.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:28.000
Do you think this game has the potential to be OMG Best Game Ever?

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.480
With all the new stuff that they're putting in, it could very well be with the level editor

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:39.640
and the video record feature and it seems like every week they keep adding new features.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.640
Sounds pretty hot.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.260
I know I'm excited about it.

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:46.840
And then I got to try the Wii Zapper I actually had fun with.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.520
Ah yes, the Wii Zapper.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.160
That's going to be coming out pretty soon, huh?

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:54.360
They had Link's crossbow training there, which was pretty good, especially if you're a Zelda

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:55.360
fan.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:01.320
I have a copy unordered because I've saved myself from purchasing other Wii games.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:06.160
I'm very excited to finally put the Wii Zapper bet to rest because we still have that going

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.160
on too.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160
I will kick your ass.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.160
The date bet.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.160
So anyway, we'll worry about that later.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.040
Mario Party DS was there, that was also a lot of fun.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:20.160
Oh yeah, I saw Mario Party 8 this weekend I forgot to mention.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.560
I saw it, I didn't play it.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.600
Because it was another Wii game that came out at the party.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.600
It's just another Mario Party game.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.600
I got it from my brother when I got him his Wii for the first time.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.080
But now you build hotels I guess or something, whatever.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:33.280
One of the maps has hotels on it or something.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.280
Anyway, sorry ShoutOutNextGen.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.080
What else is on your mind, buddy?

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:44.040
I just wanted to say that E4ALL wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of the reports were making

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.040
it out to be.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:50.800
They had about 18,000 people there I think they said, which is almost about a third of

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.600
what E3 used to draw.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.520
I would say that's pretty good for a first year without Sony and Microsoft there.

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:00.200
Well I'm glad to hear a dissenting opinion from someone who is actually there, we welcome

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.200
that.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.680
What do you think though about next year, because apparently they have it timed where

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.760
it's going to be very close to Penny Arcade Expo next year.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:11.880
Do you think that's going to be a good thing or bad or what?

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:16.280
I think now I don't really see it being too good of a move because Penny Arcade is starting

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.200
to get really huge.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.400
I don't know why they would want to draw away more potential exhibitors who would probably

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.840
rather go up to Seattle.

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.480
Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.120
Walk the wait and see.

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:33.800
Hopefully they'll smarten up and either they'll put it in October again or they'll put it

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.260
earlier in the year.

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:38.480
They might be playing a game of chicken right now to see if anybody backs down first, but

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480
we will see.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.240
Anyway, ShoutOutNextGen, we've got to let you go.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.080
We're going to try to wrap things up for tonight, but thanks so much for your call.

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.200
All right, have a good night guys.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.200
All right, you too.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.080
It's good to hear from somebody who's actually there as opposed to all the hearsay on the

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.080
internet.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.080
I'm so sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.240
I know we have more people that wanted to call in, but sadly we've got to get this show

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.800
wrapped up because we are going on a three-hour program tonight and we've got to wrap this

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.800
shit up.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:06.400
So, Loke, did you have anything else for last minute stories?

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.120
Yeah, real quick, I was going to say Heavenly Stars is going to be in No More Heroes as

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.640
well, as a song apparently, and I don't know, it should be pretty interesting.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:21.720
I guess you find a hidden VHS tape in the game or something.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.320
Well, it's kind of weird.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.860
Then let's see here, I laughed when I read this story.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.920
Apparently there were going to do some Assassin's Creed novels that were going to come out around

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.820
the same time as the game.

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:46.360
But apparently a sect of real-life assassins paid Ubisoft a visit and told them no.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.080
I don't know.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.240
I laughed at that.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:56.720
Then there was an interview with Naughty Dog about Uncharted where they said that they've

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.400
only used 30% of the PS3's power for Uncharted.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.320
So if the game sucks, that's why.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.800
Let's see here.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:15.120
And then finally, Nintendo was also, the PR manager with Nintendo was interviewed regarding

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.840
a couple things including a hard drive and friend codes.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.640
Eric Walter, of course, revealed no plans for a Wii hard drive despite the fact that

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.000
the whole WiiWare service is going to be coming.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:38.180
And also as far as the friend's codes, apparently they've pulled people through different questionnaires

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:44.800
and whatnot and people don't seem to be, they are undisturbed by them so they're going to

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.800
stay.

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800
Hooray!

01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:52.040
I do want to add to the last minute news to follow up to our breaking news earlier.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.000
The character battle is over and it's official.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.800
L-Block is the new champion after the character battle.

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:03.640
And now they're having an extra bonus round and today the L-Block is facing off against

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:11.000
the paddle, the question mark block, and the weighted companion cube that's doing battles.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.760
I can already tell the weighted companion cube is going to win just because it's current.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.760
Actually, at the current time, now it is early on in the race, but at the current time L-Block

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.720
is leading with almost 40% of the vote.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.520
Weighted companion cube is in second place but only with 27% of the vote.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.520
That'll change.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.560
The portal jokes are going to get old pretty soon, you guys.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.560
Alright.

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.200
Anyhow, show is over, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:38.400
We'll start off with Puppy, thank you so much for being here and I'm glad you got to actually

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400
talk this time.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.400
Yay!

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:45.160
So what is your final thought?

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.880
I have cavities now from all this damn candy.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.040
I know, I need an insulin shot, Jesus.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:52.440
Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.640
I fucking love my iPhone.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:30:01.120
And my final thought is, I'm going to have a candy coma.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.360
Loki, your final thought?

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:07.920
My final thought is I have way too many games to play this week and I hope my Wii works.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.920
Alright.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:09.920
Wii console.

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:10.920
Thank you guys so much.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:11.920
I'm not worried about my Wii.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.920
I know that works just fine.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.920
Okay.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:18.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Launch Radio and supporting

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.040
Independent Radio.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:23.560
If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show or go leave us a nice

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:28.280
review on iTunes, dang it, because we could always use some extra five-star reviews because

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:34.000
that helps spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.680
We don't have any of those fancy magazines.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.680
That's right.

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:40.080
We don't have any of that fancy-shmancy stuff to back us up.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.240
We do this because we love you all.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:43.360
Expensive print material.

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.240
So we appreciate it.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:50.360
So you like one of those fancy magazines, you find it at Kmart.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360
Sorry.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:58.280
Alright, on that note, until next week, I'm Rob, that's Jamie, that's Loki, and we're

01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.400
Orange Launch Radio.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:21.940
See you next week.

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:30.620
Bye-bye.
