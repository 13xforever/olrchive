1
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:19,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, November 4th, 2007, Manhunt 2 proves a pot of controversy all its own.

2
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:21,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Could Oblivion be headed online?

3
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:25,378
[SPEAKER_00]: We discuss the ultimate dodgeball showdown of pirates versus ninjas.

4
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:36,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:41,944
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much like everything to do with video games, you know.

7
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:45,787
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't suck.

8
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:47,408
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:51,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,593
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing, Jamie?

11
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:56,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And your mic is off.

12
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I see no... I turned it on.

13
00:00:58,377 --> 00:00:58,657
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

14
00:00:58,717 --> 00:00:59,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we hear you.

15
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:00,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I just turned my mic on again.

16
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:00,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

17
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:02,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was stuck.

18
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:04,146
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have been.

19
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:05,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe your mic got all sticky.

20
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:06,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do it.

21
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:08,987
[SPEAKER_02]: A likely story.

22
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to eat my salad.

23
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:12,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then you can eat your salad very soon.

24
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:13,949
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as we do Gaming Weeks.

25
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:14,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?

26
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:15,369
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get there very soon.

27
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:15,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget that.

28
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:16,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to straight my salad.

29
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:16,949
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

30
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:17,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

31
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,891
[SPEAKER_06]: While she dives in, I'm going to introduce... Will you show Op11 your lovely salad from Quiznos before you dine in there?

32
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:28,013
[SPEAKER_06]: We webcast her on the webcam here at Operator11.com.

33
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:28,873
[SPEAKER_06]: There's her lovely salad.

34
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:30,922
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is tossing her salad in the corner.

35
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to actually toss DarkSakura's salad right here on Off11Cam.

36
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.

37
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I will explain what I'm doing.

38
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:09,304
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get the salads that have lids on them, you can actually get away with using less dressing.

39
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:12,225
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pour however much you want on, close the lid and shake it up really well.

40
00:02:12,385 --> 00:02:13,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that's what I always do.

41
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:19,448
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody who is changing their lifestyle to eat healthier, there's a hint for you.

42
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:21,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Tossing your salad can be good for you.

43
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:25,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to dip your salad like the books tell you to because that's retarded.

44
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:26,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

45
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:28,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Books are retarded.

46
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:57,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that thought.

47
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:57,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

48
00:02:58,396 --> 00:02:58,616
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

49
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,938
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fat tire, not flat tire.

50
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:01,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on when you buy the beer.

51
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:02,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they misheard it.

52
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:03,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

53
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody made a typo.

54
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:05,920
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

56
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I got the message on MySpace.

57
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:10,363
[SPEAKER_06]: When did MySpace replace email?

58
00:03:10,403 --> 00:03:11,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want to know.

59
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:12,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, nobody sends me email anymore.

60
00:03:12,664 --> 00:03:13,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I just get messages on MySpace.

61
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:14,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I have something better than email.

62
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:16,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

63
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie whips out the iPhone.

64
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:18,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it on camera.

65
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie bots herself an iPhone.

66
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:21,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have your number on it or anything, does it?

67
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:22,049
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

68
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:22,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

69
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie bought yourself an iPhone.

70
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:26,832
[SPEAKER_06]: The screen went off as soon as I held it up.

71
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:27,212
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

72
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:28,732
[SPEAKER_06]: You bought yourself an iPhone.

73
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:32,113
[SPEAKER_06]: You joined the army of those that have these.

74
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:33,413
[SPEAKER_06]: What made you decide to take the plunge?

75
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:34,754
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband did.

76
00:03:35,374 --> 00:03:36,874
[SPEAKER_02]: He grabbed them and said, we want these.

77
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:37,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

78
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were like, oh, no, please stop.

79
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:40,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't.

80
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,916
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what happened is I was going to get a BlackBerry.

81
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:52,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And being that, you know, I do all this business and I need to have a planner on me and I need to have, you know, something that I can keep track of all of my work and my dates and all that in.

82
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:53,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to get a BlackBerry.

83
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,783
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, I'm a texting fiend.

84
00:03:56,744 --> 00:04:02,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured it would be cost effective for me to buy a BlackBerry instead of going out and buying a PDA.

85
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:15,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at them and the activation on them and everything ended up that it would have been more reasonable or about equal when we did all the math that I could get an iPhone.

86
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:17,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, my husband doesn't want to be shown up by his wife.

87
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had to get one too.

88
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:27,073
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think this is highly ironic that he's like, we need to watch money, we need to watch money, let's break out the gold card and buy iPhones.

89
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:30,516
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a wise purchase, though.

90
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,377
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, you guys say that women defy all logic.

91
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:33,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell no.

92
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:36,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell no.

93
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:40,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's, of course, introduce the always present other guest on our program, the chat room.

94
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:48,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to be when we tape live here on this Sunday evening, which feels like a very late Sunday evening today, thanks to Daylight Savings Time.

95
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:51,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like later than it should, and it got dark early and all that stuff.

96
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Daylight Savings Time in Ilimu is up until 5 a.m.

97
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:58,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was up until 5 too, but anyway, we'll get into that.

98
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:00,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you playing with your iPhone all night?

99
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:01,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you tossing your salad all night?

100
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:02,497
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you doing?

101
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:16,190
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is tossing her own salad.

102
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Simply amazing.

103
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she a contortionist?

104
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,893
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is a woman of many talents.

105
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:24,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only is she like a classic gaming fiend, but she is a salad connoisseur.

106
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:29,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Except I don't think that's very good to put lunch meat in your salad.

107
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:31,263
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a little bit weird.

108
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonder Dog Harold also splurged a purchase this week.

109
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:39,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my refurbed Zune from Woot.com this past week.

110
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:39,896
[SPEAKER_06]: It's faboo.

111
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:41,336
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't hear a lot about Zunes.

112
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:42,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Woot.com.

113
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:43,758
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best site ever.

114
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Woot.com is pretty fucking Woot.

115
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:47,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it makes me say Woot.

116
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never bought anything on there yet, but I always get there.

117
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever I see something I actually want, it's too late.

118
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:52,802
[SPEAKER_06]: It was gone.

119
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:55,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost bought steak knives on Woot.com.

120
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you need knives?

121
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:02,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, okay, we have the same... For eating steak.

122
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:06,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not that I eat a lot of steak, but whenever I chop vegetables, I like to use steak knives.

123
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,824
[SPEAKER_06]: When she decides to chop and then toss her own salad.

124
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:09,485
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

125
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:12,888
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are we again?

126
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,791
[SPEAKER_02]: The steak knives that we have are the same ones that Dan had when I moved in with him ten years ago.

127
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

128
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:19,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need some knife upgrades.

129
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:21,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a set of Ginsu dinner knives.

130
00:06:21,694 --> 00:06:22,895
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to go to the weapon vendor.

131
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time I bought knives, I chopped off the end of my finger.

132
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I was there when that happened, I think.

133
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:29,104
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you weren't.

134
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:30,885
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but wasn't that when we lived together?

135
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:31,486
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

136
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:32,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking of something else.

137
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I must be thinking of a deep fryer incident.

138
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:37,892
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you cut yourself on the knife using a steak knife to open boxes.

139
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:38,993
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was me.

140
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:41,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I was using a steak knife to open boxes.

141
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it was about maybe a year ago.

142
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:48,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It was around Halloween, I thought.

143
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,036
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

144
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Finger Mummy!

145
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,044
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my costume!

146
00:07:21,184 --> 00:07:22,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Finger Mummy!

147
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:22,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

148
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:25,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um... I don't know.

149
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy bandage man, give me some candy!

150
00:07:28,088 --> 00:07:32,351
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny though, because they're like, I'm like, ow, or I'm like, I cut myself, are you okay?

151
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I don't think so.

152
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,333
[SPEAKER_04]: They come over and there's blood going all over.

153
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

154
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:40,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a flashback to UHF.

155
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,817
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to drink from the fire hose.

156
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,578
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the guy doing the...

157
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,587
[SPEAKER_01]: The Carpentry and selling off his fingers.

158
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:54,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to point out as well in our chatroom, ShadowNextGen is bragging, I got the $100 HD DVD player at Walmart.

159
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:55,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear about that?

160
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:00,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Walmart's selling HD DVD players for $100 to try and push the HD DVD format.

161
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, I was in Walmart this week to buy a wireless GameCube controller.

162
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:13,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, just a GameCube controller because I needed one right away because that's when I thought that I'd have my mod shipped all installed by Friday and fortunately it took a little longer than I thought.

163
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:14,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

164
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,542
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Walmart sucks.

165
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:23,786
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, actually, I might put in the money for one of those if they're still selling them before I go to Alabama.

166
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:29,669
[SPEAKER_02]: But then my house would be the ultimate high-definition entertainment home.

167
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:35,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you have a 360, you can buy a $199 HD DVD player.

168
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:38,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could spend $100 for a dedicated HD DVD player.

169
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:40,435
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually use that on a PC, though.

170
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:42,363
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

171
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:04,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm working on getting more characters to level 90-ish.

172
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:06,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one at 92 now.

173
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:15,749
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also looked at Guild Wars, but I didn't play because my friend who I would play Guild Wars with now works Graveyard.

174
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,090
[SPEAKER_06]: You just kind of looked at it.

175
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,190
[SPEAKER_06]: You were like, hmm, it's still there.

176
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's there.

177
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:22,571
[SPEAKER_06]: No scratches or anything.

178
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:24,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan's been playing Phoenix Wright.

179
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,166
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it.

180
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:27,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I always hear the music.

181
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:28,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you're playing it right, aren't you?

182
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:28,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

183
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:29,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

184
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:34,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am, though, going to be stealing the PSP, though, now that he's done with Rondo of Blood.

185
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:38,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be playing the hell out of that because it's coming with me to Alabama.

186
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:39,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

187
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:41,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

188
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to be able to play Ragnarok when I'm in Alabama.

189
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:45,599
[SPEAKER_04]: OMGZ.

190
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad that powerful iPhone can't run Ragnarok.

191
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:54,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can, you know, go on my live journal.

192
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Posting a live journal on the iPhone, by the way, is ass.

193
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,941
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not what the iPhones are for.

194
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:02,981
[SPEAKER_06]: iPhones are for phoning.

195
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:08,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has an iPod on it, so I can listen to stuff.

196
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:10,343
[SPEAKER_06]: You can listen to the Ragnarok soundtrack.

197
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:15,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I actually installed the game, I didn't install the music in it.

198
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:17,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you do that?

199
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't feel like it, because, you know, the music takes up a lot of space, and I'm playing on my lappy.

200
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your laptop that...

201
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:27,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Crunched for Space?

202
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:29,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

203
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:35,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Not now that I have my portable hard drive, but I just don't want to bother with it.

204
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:40,690
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did actually play some of the games on the Homestar Runner site.

205
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that count?

206
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:42,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

207
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:42,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

208
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:43,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing Trogdor.

209
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:44,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Flash games are awesome.

210
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:50,694
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what you could always do is you could do some LARPing when you're in Alabama, and you could pretend that you're in Ragnarok.

211
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:53,055
[SPEAKER_06]: You could be all, Hail...

212
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here to kick you in the face.

213
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:57,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll ban you.

214
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:02,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Ban you forever.

215
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:02,658
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

216
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to LARP in Alabama.

217
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:09,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I played live-action vampire when I was, you know, freshly in college.

218
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,084
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not supposed to admit to that.

219
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:14,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm recovered.

220
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:19,410
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the first step of acceptance is... Admitting you have a problem.

221
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:21,592
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

222
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:24,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I admitted I have a problem.

223
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:25,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved.

224
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:29,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma is reminding us of the best part of the LARP.

225
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:33,027
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the part where I run up to Jamie and go, Heal, please!

226
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:34,588
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

227
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:36,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Warp front once, please.

228
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, because, because, that's why.

229
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:40,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play a priest, ha.

230
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Except I'm playing a crusader and people come up to my crusader and go, Heal, please.

231
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:48,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Crusaders can heal.

232
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Kick them in the face.

233
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,612
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

234
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:51,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

235
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:53,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay, actually.

236
00:11:55,777 --> 00:12:00,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, I did not play any of my Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction.

237
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:05,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Unshrunk the game, but didn't touch it.

238
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know when I'm going to play my PlayStation 3.

239
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I played... What was it?

240
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:12,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

241
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:14,498
[SPEAKER_04]: God of War, Chains of Olympus

242
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:48,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, let's see, other than that, I played a little bit of Half-Life 2, some more Portal for that.

243
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:50,938
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

244
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:54,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally figured out what the weighted companion cube is.

245
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:58,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I get all the jokes and they're not funny.

246
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:00,848
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see, what else?

247
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:04,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I also played some Halo 3, actually, over...

248
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,443
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Halloween.

249
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:10,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And we played over live.

250
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:21,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't really play much over live, but we went over to a friend's house and for Halloween we played Halo 3 while my wife and my friend's wife were playing Liar's Dice from Pirates of the Caravan.

251
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 for Halloween, that infection playlist was fun.

252
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:27,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

253
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Except we didn't really do that.

254
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:30,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, wait.

255
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:31,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

256
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:32,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that back.

257
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:34,034
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't play over Halloween because...

258
00:13:35,154 --> 00:13:36,394
[SPEAKER_04]: The Halloween Party was last Saturday.

259
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So there, we already talked about that.

260
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:39,816
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did not play Halo 3.

261
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:42,317
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I did not hook up my 360 live at all.

262
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:46,578
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will assume you're playing Simpsons, the game, because that looks awesome.

263
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:48,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Although it's getting mediocre reviews.

264
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:49,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

265
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,400
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what other game got mediocre reviews?

266
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Force 2017.

267
00:13:54,701 --> 00:14:00,563
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still have to go back and finish that damn game, because I motherfucking can't beat the Inferno mode on that.

268
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:02,529
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

269
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you burn yourself at all?

270
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:33,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not burn myself at all, but I was just so stressed out all week because I took it to work to do it.

271
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:41,973
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, I didn't want my wife really knowing that I was doing it right away because she would have said, you're going to break that thing, and I didn't want to have anything to do with that.

272
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:46,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, if you've looked at my computer room, there's no way I can solder in there, although I did last night.

273
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:50,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And heaven forbid someone get between Mrs. Loki and her excite truck.

274
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, I was so afraid.

275
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:57,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, this thing better work when I'm done because she's going to want to play Excite Truck.

276
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:59,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit.

277
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:02,406
[SPEAKER_04]: That's honestly the first time I've ever heard you admit to fear.

278
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:04,087
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just scary.

279
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:10,713
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so I actually had it broken open in our conference room for Thursday and Friday.

280
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:11,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Just...

281
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,891
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

282
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

283
00:15:52,503 --> 00:15:53,524
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

284
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:25,987
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I did want to play when I get it all hooked up is the first Simple Series game on the Wii, which is that kart racing game.

285
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:27,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be fun.

286
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:33,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I know later on they're going to add some more to the Simple Series, so that's kind of what I'm looking forward to with this mod chip.

287
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:43,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, today when I left, I think I figured out what I did wrong, but it does play Excite Truck, so crisis averted for now.

288
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:48,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the other thing, and we'll get into this a little bit later.

289
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:49,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Manhunt 2 on the PSP.

290
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we get into the story a little bit later on, I'll explain.

291
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:55,979
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hack the hell out of that game.

292
00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:05,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure it was a completely unaltered retail version of the game that you would never think of reading about all these hack and crack stories and doing this to your precious copy of the game.

293
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:08,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rockstar never intended for that to happen.

294
00:17:08,363 --> 00:17:12,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally didn't have a modded PSP or anything to do that.

295
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:12,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm

296
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:15,903
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

297
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: which I've played a lot more of.

298
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:43,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week I didn't really want to say a lot about it because I hadn't played much, but now I've played a lot of the game, and it is a worthy sequel, I think is the best way I can sum it up.

299
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:46,047
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

300
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:07,302
[SPEAKER_05]: and some of the design aspects.

301
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:09,503
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your bitches with the Guitar Hero 3?

302
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:13,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for one, the controllers he designed, way too sensitive for it.

303
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:30,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the design stuff on the notes and the note stream coming down, there's some stuff you're used to in Guitar Hero 2 and 1 where when the notes jump up on the board when you activate star power, it doesn't happen in 3 and it's hard to tell when you activate it just because it's the only thing that happens is it changes colors.

304
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:30,406
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

305
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:33,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of the character designs, meh.

306
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:37,126
[SPEAKER_05]: They took out Pandora, which made me sad, because she was cool.

307
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,507
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of the... I mean, it's cool that they got Midori.

308
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:42,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what she says.

309
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:47,848
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as I saw that character when I opened up the game, I knew that was who we were going to play.

310
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:52,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys actually saying that you play Guitar Hero for the characters?

311
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's like playing Karaoke Revolution for the characters.

312
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun, though.

313
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie says she played rock band.

314
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get to that in a minute because I had a rock band experience too.

315
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:04,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

316
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:04,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So I heart Midori.

317
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,022
[SPEAKER_06]: The songs are fun.

318
00:19:06,102 --> 00:19:11,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I beat the game on medium because I'm not that great at Guitar Hero, but I'm working my way through on hard now, and then I'll work up to expert.

319
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:14,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's what Guitar Hero 3 has that the other games didn't have.

320
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:17,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Live, online, competitive play, which is actually a lot of fun.

321
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:25,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I played with one of my friends, and we were playing some co-op mode, and I couldn't really play co-op mode in Guitar Hero 2 because nobody ever really came over with their guitar.

322
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:28,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a really nice feature.

323
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:35,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't done it on live yet, I've just been practicing on hard mode just to kind of get back into it since I haven't played Guitar Hero in almost a year.

324
00:19:36,477 --> 00:19:38,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, and Guitar Hero 3 has Raining Blood.

325
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:38,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

326
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't even get me started on that shit.

327
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:02,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have fun with that.

328
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:26,796
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's all I can think of.

329
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:34,520
[SPEAKER_04]: All the games because all your live accounts are tied into you can bring them up on your PC and stuff like that.

330
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:53,250
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Guitar Hero thing has the leaderboards and you can make your own little clan online and have a message form and I'll tell you more about the OL Army Guitar Hero band in a minute and all that and I think that's kind of cool even if it's been kind of clunky these first couple weeks I'm hoping that in a couple weeks it will smooth out and things will run

331
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,141
[SPEAKER_06]: It's certainly something that Harmonix wouldn't have had the resources to do on their own.

332
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:21,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Cousin had a birthday, and he has a Wii.

333
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:26,829
[SPEAKER_06]: And we went and played Big Brain Academy on the Wii, which is like, I guess, the brain training game on the Wii.

334
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

335
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another mini-game collection, the kind of game that's easily accessible by anyone.

336
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,013
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing.

337
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:35,514
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not enough mini-games.

338
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I like some of the party modes.

339
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:46,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the competitive mode where you work your way through the mini-games as fast as you can against other people within the same room was kind of fun.

340
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:47,201
[SPEAKER_06]: But

341
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:48,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

342
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:12,239
[SPEAKER_06]: They call it Big Brain Academy for a reason, I suppose.

343
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Try before you buy Big Brain Academy because it's very limited.

344
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,963
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have young ones, though, I bet they'd get a kick out of it.

345
00:22:18,983 --> 00:22:19,403
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

346
00:22:19,843 --> 00:22:22,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Spend your $50 on something better.

347
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a brain training game.

348
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:26,127
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a lot of money for this game.

349
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:27,547
[SPEAKER_04]: A brain training game on the Wii.

350
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,128
[SPEAKER_04]: You're an idiot if you bought it.

351
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:30,969
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I do to train my brain?

352
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I read.

353
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I study things.

354
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:35,091
[SPEAKER_01]: You can.

355
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:38,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need a game to help my brain.

356
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:39,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band.

357
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:40,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, you wanted to talk about Rock Band real quick.

358
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:40,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

359
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:53,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan and I went to Best Buy because we were going to pick up Spider-Man 3, which actually we ended up getting a better deal at Target anyway because Best Buy had a two-disc thing and Target had a three-disc thing for like $2 less.

360
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:56,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I digress.

361
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:58,787
[SPEAKER_02]: But they had the demo for Rock Band sitting out.

362
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:23,606
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was just okay the guitars were both destroyed and of course Dan went right for them but the drum set was pretty cool and it was a lot of fun I made him play Weezer because I love Weezer so it was really cool I probably went to the same Best Buy you did at one point this week because I had to buy the Twin Peaks Gold Box Edition which they didn't have at Best Buy I had to go somewhere else to get it but anyway nevertheless

363
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I really liked the little drum, you know, where you could, uh, uh,

364
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:47,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Freestyle a little bit, you know, where you could ad lib.

365
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:48,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see that part.

366
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:49,213
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

367
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:58,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it'll bring it up to where all of the lines are lit up, and you can pretty much free play on those measures.

368
00:23:58,998 --> 00:24:02,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really cool.

369
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:02,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

370
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,540
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I play this week?

371
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's about it.

372
00:24:05,761 --> 00:24:06,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was one other thing.

373
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:09,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I helped William set up his new PSP, and that was about it.

374
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:12,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So there we go, our gaming weeks.

375
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:16,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move on then, and we'll talk a little bit about housekeeping.

376
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:22,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And I promised a little bit ago I would talk about our Guitar Hero 3 band.

377
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:31,089
[SPEAKER_06]: If you search for OLR in the tour groups on the Orange Islands Radio website, it'll take you right to our OLR band, which I'm happy to say is in the top 100.

378
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:32,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 76 Rockin' Top 10

379
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:53,797
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna be not resting for a while Well, I'm number two, so I'll be moving up

380
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:23,387
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really all I wanted to say.

381
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:24,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, I plugged in there.

382
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,698
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a MySpace and all that other stuff, so you should find us and add us.

383
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:31,810
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course we always tape live on Sunday nights and that's in our chat room.

384
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:40,714
[SPEAKER_06]: If you miss the live broadcast on Sunday nights you can always listen to our rebroadcast on All Games Radio Monday nights after All Games Interactive or Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

385
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:41,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Pacific.

386
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:42,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, enough plugging.

387
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:43,696
[SPEAKER_06]: News time.

388
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:44,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming news.

389
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:48,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so of course this week Manhunt 2 came out.

390
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,379
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I say last week?

391
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody will be talking about Manhunt 2 this week.

392
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:55,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's going on.

393
00:25:56,242 --> 00:25:56,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course...

394
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:04,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Sooner than later, we have a mini hot coffee on our hands.

395
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:11,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the PSP version, the ISO of it, out on the internet like any other game out there.

396
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,084
[SPEAKER_04]: People looked into it and they hacked the distortion that would happen when you would do your kills.

397
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:23,048
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that's hacked out of the way, you now have an uncut version of the game.

398
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:33,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, which is funny, because I actually kind of looked a little bit at this for research purposes, and, um, all they have, it literally is just INI files.

399
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:35,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, stupid...

400
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:38,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Fully documented INI files.

401
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:44,531
[SPEAKER_04]: It even says, you know, this is where the distortion stuff is for your deaths.

402
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:45,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can take that out.

403
00:26:45,852 --> 00:26:54,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually went as far as not only just removing the distortion in there, but I made all the guards blind and deaf, which was fun.

404
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:56,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, there's a ton of things.

405
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You can edit everything in the game.

406
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the weapon damage, you name it, it's in there.

407
00:27:03,328 --> 00:27:08,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, for some reason, when it did make the guys blind and deaf, everything got really, really bright.

408
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:10,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

409
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:12,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Somehow, the lighting's attached to that.

410
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:15,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Controversy aside, I want to ask first off, is the game good?

411
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:15,435
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

412
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:16,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

413
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:22,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It's... They're really, I mean, plot-wise for the game, I mean, there's, I guess, some sort of a storyline going along.

414
00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:24,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only played through the second level.

415
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the third level.

416
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:27,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

417
00:27:28,086 --> 00:27:29,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just death after death.

418
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:31,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just all about murdering people.

419
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:36,173
[SPEAKER_04]: That really is... There's no big art thing in this.

420
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:39,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just murdering people.

421
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, this is not art.

422
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:42,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an art.

423
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: There's probably drugs in there somewhere, too.

424
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an art.

425
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:46,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there is a storyline that goes along with it.

426
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:50,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure when you play through the entire game, you figure out why he's killing people.

427
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:51,267
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean...

428
00:27:52,503 --> 00:28:05,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just shoot somebody and they're dead, or, no, this game, you decide, I'm gonna kill someone with a pen, I'm gonna kill someone with a syringe, I'm gonna kill someone with, you know, a bit of barbed wire, and I'm gonna saw their balls off with the barbed wire.

429
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just a little over the top.

430
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:12,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think if I'm gonna kill someone with barbed wire, sawing their balls off wouldn't be the first thing that would come to my mind.

431
00:28:12,614 --> 00:28:13,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a little excessive.

432
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Piker Uno says, so it's a murder simulator.

433
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:20,605
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not a murder simulator because you're not really simulating murder.

434
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:25,788
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just simulating a crazy guy that's running away and happens to be killing people to get away.

435
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:30,650
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was going to kill somebody with barbed wire, I would do one of two things.

436
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:36,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I would either run it across their leg on the inside where the artery is or across their neck where the carotid is.

437
00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:37,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what they kind of did.

438
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:38,693
[SPEAKER_04]: They ran it across their leg.

439
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:40,654
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three different kills you can do with each weapon.

440
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:46,857
[SPEAKER_04]: One of which, I think for barbed wire, the big one was running it through their leg

441
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:47,627
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

442
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I shut it off.

443
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:03,235
[SPEAKER_04]: It was stupid.

444
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:04,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have it?

445
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:06,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It was somewhere on the internet.

446
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,398
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on some of the big game blogs.

447
00:29:08,478 --> 00:29:10,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched part of it and I was like, this is stupid.

448
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:17,123
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I reacted the same way to that video that I did to the movie, the Saw trilogy or quad trilogy or whatever it is now.

449
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:18,164
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'll never watch them.

450
00:29:18,244 --> 00:29:19,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Saw 4 is not art either.

451
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:20,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

452
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:21,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one movie at the box office last weekend.

453
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:22,847
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not art either.

454
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:23,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

455
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:24,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because people have no taste.

456
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:29,473
[SPEAKER_04]: They complain that the ESRB is being too hard on them and stuff like that.

457
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:30,514
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think so.

458
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:35,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I see them, with the whole hot coffee thing, I think rating that game adult only is stupid.

459
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I do agree with that.

460
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:41,565
[SPEAKER_04]: But with Manhunt 2, you just watch the murder scene

461
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:44,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Piker Uno wants to know, can you kill someone with a boat fire?

462
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

463
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:34,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is bullshit anyways, because the hot coffee thing was a hack as well, but apparently they're dumb, and so... Well, didn't this time Rockstar disclosed everything that was in the game that was changeable?

464
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,252
[SPEAKER_04]: See, yeah, I mean, they didn't really hide anything.

465
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, all they did was remove the distortion.

466
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:47,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's the same as saying, like, the Sims where they have patches where you can remove the blur so that you can see...

467
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:49,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Sim body parts.

468
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's stupid.

469
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:59,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I do think that the game should have been released unmodified without the distortion on there.

470
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:04,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to be honest, I don't enjoy it with the distortion on there because you can't see what the fuck is going on.

471
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,442
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of that, if you go further, it's kind of censorship.

472
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:13,282
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, the hilarious part about all this is why did anybody even run out and buy this game in the first place?

473
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:14,403
[SPEAKER_06]: The controversy.

474
00:31:14,744 --> 00:31:16,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Why was this game hacked within 24 hours?

475
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:17,706
[SPEAKER_06]: The controversy.

476
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:24,612
[SPEAKER_06]: If word had never come out that there was another version of this game...

477
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:27,513
[SPEAKER_06]: That had the blurs taken away.

478
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:31,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet nobody would have ever thought, gee, let's go in there and hack the disc.

479
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:33,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they certainly wouldn't have done it in 24 hours.

480
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:35,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's another thing, though.

481
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:40,519
[SPEAKER_06]: That was issuing a challenge to the hacking community to find the original content in the game.

482
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:41,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did it.

483
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:41,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You knew they would.

484
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,601
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past, I've actually been curious and looked at different ISOs.

485
00:31:45,961 --> 00:31:51,043
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been the easiest to modify ISO I have ever seen.

486
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:54,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It is seriously fully documented.

487
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:54,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

488
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:58,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not take a genius to fix this stuff.

489
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:01,797
[SPEAKER_04]: You see the part where for blurring it out, you remove it, done.

490
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, ooh, that's really tough.

491
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:06,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, it's stupid.

492
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they kept it easy because they had to fix it so fast to get the game out on Halloween?

493
00:32:12,003 --> 00:32:17,747
[SPEAKER_04]: They did have to fix the game, and I understand that, but no, they could have easily encrypted that stuff.

494
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:21,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been a file that's not just a plain text file.

495
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:22,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been encrypted.

496
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have been something that people couldn't find.

497
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:29,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it a little bit harder for them, but I don't know, it's just really stupid.

498
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:33,599
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw says, keep in mind they only hacked the PSP version.

499
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,280
[SPEAKER_06]: An average person will not be able to figure out how to do that.

500
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, and I'm going to tell you this much, the PlayStation 2 version is going to be hacked before you know it.

501
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:46,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, let me put it this way, the INI files that were documented in there, it was for both PlayStation 2 and PSP.

502
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:47,808
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only a matter of time.

503
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:52,471
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole controversy is just waving a red cape at the hacking community right now.

504
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:53,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Ole!

505
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:54,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Ole!

506
00:32:55,814 --> 00:32:59,737
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a modded console, this is going to be hacked pretty soon.

507
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:01,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no doubt about it.

508
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm looking at just what they have in there.

509
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:10,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, the INI files that were in there are documented for both PSP and PlayStation 2.

510
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the Wii version is also the same as well.

511
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:15,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But those two were mentioned in that file.

512
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't see why it wouldn't be the same.

513
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:19,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

514
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:20,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just stupid.

515
00:33:20,652 --> 00:33:21,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they did it on purpose.

516
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:26,997
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw says, I think the only way you can hack the PS2 version if they did it via the Pro Action Replay.

517
00:33:28,878 --> 00:33:37,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, I think you can actually mod, I mean, because there's people out there that make custom Guitar Hero games, you know, for the PlayStation 2 if you have a modded console.

518
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:39,566
[SPEAKER_04]: You can create custom ISOs for that stuff.

519
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:40,907
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what this reminds me of?

520
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:48,392
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole thing reminds me of, remember when Nintendo made that controversial move to change the blood in Mortal Kombat 2 to sweat?

521
00:33:49,318 --> 00:34:16,813
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was like suddenly it became this challenge all over like who can find the game genie code first that will change the sweat to red to bring back the blood into Mortal Kombat 2 it became a contest it was the red cape at the community going put me back the way I was supposed to be because we all know this game was fixed but here's the thing though I think even removing the distortion or whatever it really doesn't change anything in the game I mean

522
00:34:17,893 --> 00:34:21,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's violent and stuff, but to be honest, it's just like hostile.

523
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:22,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Hostile wasn't a good movie.

524
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:23,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a violent movie.

525
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like this game.

526
00:34:24,558 --> 00:34:25,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a good game.

527
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,279
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a violent game.

528
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:30,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just changing cutscenes and not actual gameplay.

529
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of pissed off at Rockstar for, I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

530
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:39,094
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to, like, ruin everything by making games overly violent so that people come down on them harder.

531
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:41,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, why do people keep coming after us?

532
00:34:41,695 --> 00:34:42,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfair.

533
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:50,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you should stop, you know, I don't know, having people with limbs being blown off and stuff like that in very graphic manners.

534
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:50,519
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?

535
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's a start.

536
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Manhunt Controversy

537
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Woot for them getting publicity.

538
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:29,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you have it.

539
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:54,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if that's just a demand thing, though, because when I think of big video game retailers, I don't always think of Target.

540
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Target has a very limited selection of games.

541
00:35:57,051 --> 00:36:03,977
[SPEAKER_06]: They carry what's kind of current and popular, and honestly, controversy aside, I don't think this game is going to sell very well, and I think they kind of know that.

542
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:06,839
[SPEAKER_06]: They would rather be stocking games that are going to sell more copies.

543
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will sell well.

544
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cheap.

545
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like $39.99 for the Wii, $29.99 for PS2 and PSP.

546
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:10,282
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

547
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:46,619
[SPEAKER_02]: well there are other people mad about Manhunt and for a different reason um in the manual for Manhunt they didn't mention one of the major parties that worked on the game being uh Vienna yeah let's sort of forget you know people who worked on the game here so um they uh that's kind of messed up well yeah well their studio was closed down but they still should have been um as Rockstar Vienna they uh

548
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:50,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Still should have been credited for all the work that they did.

549
00:36:50,282 --> 00:36:54,325
[SPEAKER_02]: They said it was over 50 people working for two years on the game.

550
00:36:55,527 --> 00:37:02,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's almost like Rockstar Vienna got shut down and then all traces of it were erased in history because apparently they didn't get credited in this game.

551
00:37:02,774 --> 00:37:05,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Which might be good for them anyways.

552
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:06,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be pissed off too.

553
00:37:07,383 --> 00:37:09,564
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, do you really want your name on this game?

554
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:10,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really?

555
00:37:11,425 --> 00:37:17,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I agree completely that people should get credit for the work they do, but I would be using an alias.

556
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:17,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my thing.

557
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:24,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they should have made Manhunt 2 just make it seriously, I mean, go all out.

558
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:27,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a PC version out there and just fucking go nuts.

559
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:32,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do what you would do in Manhunt 2 times ten.

560
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, just crazy over the top.

561
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:41,324
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

562
00:38:03,456 --> 00:38:13,398
[SPEAKER_04]: In other news, and this is actually a little bit of an opposite, Sony actually has a brand new advertising campaign coming out for the PlayStation 3 that, oh my god, does actually not suck.

563
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:21,940
[SPEAKER_04]: This campaign, of course, a little bit different than the last year's campaign, which is known as the White Room.

564
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:31,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to Peter Dill of the PSN Network and also the Senior Vice President of Marketing,

565
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:45,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently he says, uh, last year we launched a PS3 campaign that became known as The White Room, and we received a strong reaction to those ads for being provocative and demonstrating the PS3's power.

566
00:38:47,275 --> 00:38:48,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, nope.

567
00:38:49,697 --> 00:38:52,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, um... Macman in our chat says, The White Room?

568
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Racist.

569
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

570
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:24,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get how he says they received a strong reaction for being provocative.

571
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,523
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they didn't make any sense.

572
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:26,945
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't make any sense.

573
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:29,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't understand why the PlayStation 3 is making a baby cry.

574
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:35,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't understand why it was making baseballs explode or whatever.

575
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:37,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It made no fucking sense.

576
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:41,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you actually have an advertising campaign or a series of commercials saying,

577
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:45,718
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually show gameplay, get people excited about the games and stuff like that.

578
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:47,659
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you should have done from the beginning.

579
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of, ooh.

580
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, all three consoles did the same thing.

581
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:55,042
[SPEAKER_04]: They did these really weird-ass commercials that made no sense.

582
00:39:55,382 --> 00:39:58,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, with Xbox, the whole jump-in shit, that makes no sense.

583
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:02,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have one going on right now, which they have, like, a little kid, like, singing a song and stuff.

584
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:06,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they show Mass Effect, Halo 3, and, like, oh, God, I don't remember.

585
00:40:07,026 --> 00:40:08,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Bioshock.

586
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,527
[SPEAKER_04]: All M-rated games, you know.

587
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's, like, kids.

588
00:40:10,627 --> 00:40:10,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

589
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:12,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox!

590
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:15,194
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, it's just like so stupid.

591
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:20,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, I'm glad that they finally have a good marketing campaign.

592
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:21,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't

593
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:31,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, next time you're launching a console, don't get all fucking crazy and hire this marketing team to come up with these stupid ideas like baby crying and stuff.

594
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:32,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes no fucking sense.

595
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:34,395
[SPEAKER_04]: People get creeped out by that shit.

596
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:35,716
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to buy your console.

597
00:40:35,816 --> 00:40:43,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one of the new commercials I saw earlier today, it had tentacles and disembodied mouths coming out of the system.

598
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:43,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.

599
00:40:44,482 --> 00:40:44,922
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

600
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:45,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what people want.

601
00:40:45,983 --> 00:40:46,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Disembodied mouths.

602
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:47,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And tentacles.

603
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:47,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And tentacles.

604
00:40:48,124 --> 00:40:48,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And tentacles.

605
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:54,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if I were marketing the PlayStation 3 right now, my marketing campaign would go along the lines of something like this.

606
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:57,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be like, let's imagine it was a radio commercial for the PlayStation 3.

607
00:40:57,787 --> 00:40:58,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

608
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Please buy one.

609
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

610
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:05,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do anything.

611
00:41:05,374 --> 00:41:08,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Motorstorm and I play Blu-rays.

612
00:41:08,437 --> 00:41:09,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

613
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:13,842
[SPEAKER_04]: They say that they have games out there, but I don't know about that.

614
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:21,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I have home in 2008 some Final Fantasy XIII sometime in the future.

615
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Why won't you buy it?

616
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:30,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They are showing Gran Turismo Prologue though, even though that's not available over here yet at all.

617
00:41:32,368 --> 00:41:34,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be fair, that's not really even a game.

618
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:42,305
[SPEAKER_06]: or another PlayStation 3 commercial could be buy a PlayStation 3 and fold proteins all day long.

619
00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:45,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they did show that it plays Blu-ray and stuff.

620
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:46,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

621
00:41:46,528 --> 00:41:49,429
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation 3 is helping to cure cancer.

622
00:41:49,849 --> 00:41:53,291
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't buy a PlayStation 3, that means you support cancer.

623
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:55,893
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

624
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am all for cancer.

625
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:58,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, cancer.

626
00:41:59,495 --> 00:41:59,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

627
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:02,825
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very tasteless little side tangent there.

628
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:06,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about things that should probably be omitted from the campaign.

629
00:42:07,246 --> 00:42:11,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it caused one particular company's stocks to drop a little bit this week.

630
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:15,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the news that Metal Gear Solid 4 has gotten another little push.

631
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Got a little push back.

632
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, surprise!

633
00:42:18,848 --> 00:42:21,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember how Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to come out first quarter of 2008?

634
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:23,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, scratch that.

635
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:24,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it second quarter 2008.

636
00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:27,690
[SPEAKER_06]: The day this news was announced, by the way...

637
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:35,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami's stocks went down a little bit because this was the game that's supposed to be really giving a kick in the pants to the PlayStation 3.

638
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:38,022
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the few exclusives they have left.

639
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:39,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

640
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:40,804
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

641
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:45,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Gear Solid 4 delayed until quarter two 2008.

642
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:53,314
[SPEAKER_06]: The official reason, by the way, quote, further improvements to the quality of the game and provide even greater enjoyment for more customers worldwide.

643
00:42:53,774 --> 00:42:54,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong.

644
00:42:55,393 --> 00:43:01,214
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is what they need to do to ensure the game is going to be an A++ and not suck, I'm all for it.

645
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:03,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sucks for Sony right now.

646
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:08,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least it's not being powered by the Unreal 3 engine, so we know it's not because of that.

647
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:08,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

648
00:43:09,176 --> 00:43:12,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't care about the delay if it's going to make the game awesome.

649
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:16,377
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I'm aware, there's no flying dragons in this game, so I know it's not anything like that.

650
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:18,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

651
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:29,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that with any game, they need to keep pushing things back if they don't have them done rather than release a buggy, unfinished, crappy product.

652
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:33,032
[SPEAKER_01]: What game do we remember that did that?

653
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:34,032
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter, though.

654
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seriously going to be like Twilight Princess.

655
00:43:37,554 --> 00:43:38,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

656
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:41,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll get 10 when it's released because people have a fucking hard-on for that game.

657
00:43:43,456 --> 00:43:47,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is actually something that might make people happy.

658
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It is still hanging out in rumor land.

659
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:56,575
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's speculation that there's going to be a new PlayStation 2 in 2008 for $99.

660
00:43:58,857 --> 00:44:09,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually is reported by NCV that it would be introduced in the UK at 75 pounds or lower.

661
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:14,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know because Sony hasn't, you know.

662
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:17,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone would care

663
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:42,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, whatever.

664
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:43,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Tough.

665
00:44:43,553 --> 00:44:45,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy VII for life.

666
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I busted out Jumping Flash, like, about a month ago.

667
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, if you want to play Jumping Flash, you can buy yourself a PlayStation 3 and download that shit.

668
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Or buy a PSP and download that shit.

669
00:44:55,202 --> 00:44:56,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But you shouldn't have to pay for it again.

670
00:44:56,804 --> 00:44:57,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should I?

671
00:44:57,504 --> 00:44:58,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I actually own the game.

672
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:01,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then you should have bought a PlayStation 2 seven years ago.

673
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a PlayStation 2.

674
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then this doesn't affect you.

675
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,791
[SPEAKER_04]: She wants more!

676
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:14,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that's still playing PlayStation 1 right now, I mean... But I'm just saying that there's still people who like to break out their classic games.

677
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, then I hope they have a PlayStation 1.

678
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:19,854
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not going to be buying new PlayStation 1 games.

679
00:45:19,914 --> 00:45:26,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, whereas PlayStation 3 not playing PlayStation 2 games, that's stupid because they're still putting out new PlayStation 2 games.

680
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:33,759
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's safe to remove the PlayStation 1 backwards compatibility in this if...

681
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:35,746
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's what they're going to do.

682
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:36,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just theorizing.

683
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:39,989
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura says, Loki, no, don't give them ideas.

684
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft agrees that Jumping Flash is awesome.

685
00:45:44,192 --> 00:45:45,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Jumping Flash is freaking rad.

686
00:45:47,157 --> 00:45:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

687
00:45:47,538 --> 00:45:48,559
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they need to do.

688
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:52,823
[SPEAKER_02]: That will completely revive the PlayStation 3 as a new jumping flash.

689
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that'll be it.

690
00:45:54,805 --> 00:46:01,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everyone's out there going, gee, if only a new jumping flash would come out, then I would have something to play on this damn thing.

691
00:46:01,271 --> 00:46:03,974
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Bubsy 3D Part 2?

692
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:05,055
[SPEAKER_02]: How about not?

693
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:07,598
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Clay Fighters?

694
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:12,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you, how long ago do we say this in a game?

695
00:46:12,264 --> 00:46:13,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss playing Helga.

696
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:21,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Six months ago when these console wars were heating up and stuff, we said the first console that gets LaserCats the game...

697
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:27,056
[SPEAKER_06]: will win the next-gen wars, and we have yet to see LaserCats the game, so it's anybody's guess.

698
00:46:27,096 --> 00:46:30,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's technically, I mean... It's coming out on Dreamcast!

699
00:46:30,378 --> 00:46:36,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Postal 3's got that one gun that's a bat, you know, a guy's hand up a badger's ass, so that's kind of close.

700
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:39,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really, it's not a cat with a frickin' laser on its head.

701
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:44,505
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know that they don't have LaserCats in that, I mean... Next story, please.

702
00:46:45,026 --> 00:46:45,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways...

703
00:46:46,252 --> 00:46:48,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Another game that's been delayed a little bit.

704
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:52,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's finally officially coming out on, well, PC at least.

705
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:53,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Unreal Tournament 3.

706
00:46:54,058 --> 00:46:56,819
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been announced on PC for November 19th.

707
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,402
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 3 version is coming soon.

708
00:47:02,243 --> 00:47:02,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably 2008.

709
00:47:04,185 --> 00:47:05,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's soon.

710
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:12,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that they're giving the same old excuse my mom gave when I asked, Mom, when's dinner?

711
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:14,412
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be here when it's done.

712
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:14,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

713
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:17,575
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what they're saying about Unreal.

714
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:19,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You will have it when it's done.

715
00:47:19,856 --> 00:47:21,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Now sit down and shut up and watch TV.

716
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:40,894
[SPEAKER_06]: All I know is Unreal Tournament, the older games were fast.

717
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:46,518
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you like your shooters nauseatingly fast, Unreal's the place to go.

718
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,280
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to see all the mods for this.

719
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what I'm interested in.

720
00:47:49,981 --> 00:47:50,822
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be kind of cool.

721
00:47:52,643 --> 00:47:53,784
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

722
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,402
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, the PlayStation 3 version not only will have the characters, but it will have extra story sequences.

723
00:48:25,922 --> 00:48:33,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, the 360 fans are like, you know, especially me, you know, I bought the game on 360 and I don't even own a PlayStation 3 as of yet.

724
00:48:33,964 --> 00:48:37,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of going, can it be download content time, please?

725
00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:38,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, can I have it?

726
00:48:39,646 --> 00:48:40,146
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

727
00:48:41,587 --> 00:48:44,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Eternal Sonata on the PlayStation 3 with extra crap next year.

728
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yay.

729
00:48:47,188 --> 00:48:49,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I still should play that, but I haven't had time.

730
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this makes me relatively happy, although it's more of a, you know, because, hi, I'm tongue-tied.

731
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:07,584
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really, I think, great news is that the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on PSP are coming out in the UK.

732
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:10,785
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a PAL conversion, so it'll be out in early 2008.

733
00:49:11,425 --> 00:49:17,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really, really good because it's, the second one especially is such a good game.

734
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:22,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the third and fifth were my favorites.

735
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:26,685
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we've had this for a while, and they're really good.

736
00:49:27,766 --> 00:49:30,187
[SPEAKER_02]: The remakes have just been... Very sharp.

737
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,288
[SPEAKER_06]: The coloring and the graphics, very sharp.

738
00:49:33,189 --> 00:49:41,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually bought, because I bought William the PSP for his birthday, and I bought him a copy of Final Fantasy I. Because he's a big fan of Final Fantasy.

739
00:49:41,634 --> 00:49:41,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

740
00:49:42,918 --> 00:49:57,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what I was saying is that they're basically taking the old Nintendo versions and they're retooled with widescreen, new dungeons, redrawn artwork, just the works.

741
00:49:57,525 --> 00:50:01,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really glad that it's coming out over there finally.

742
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:03,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be really good.

743
00:50:04,388 --> 00:50:07,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was much rejoicing overseas.

744
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:08,790
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, back at home.

745
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to travel around the world and look at some release dates.

746
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

747
00:50:13,464 --> 00:50:14,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Release date!

748
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:21,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, this week marks the first of many very packed weeks with plenty of things coming out.

749
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:29,627
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, though, there are some stupid things coming out, including Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am on PlayStation 2.

750
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:33,848
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't get enough of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, there you go.

751
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:35,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

752
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Bratz for real on the DS.

753
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:39,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

754
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:41,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Build-A-Bear Workshop.

755
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:44,110
[SPEAKER_06]: As opposed to Bratz for fake.

756
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the things you see on the Bratz are probably fake, actually.

757
00:50:47,851 --> 00:50:52,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Build-A-Bear Workshop, where you can create your own... It's a teddy bear sim.

758
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:54,053
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, this game's $30.

759
00:50:54,313 --> 00:50:58,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably buy a real teddy bear for a lot cheaper, so that's kind of stupid.

760
00:50:58,614 --> 00:51:02,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I think building a bear in the workshop and the actual store costs less than that.

761
00:51:02,455 --> 00:51:02,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

762
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:03,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

763
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:04,396
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit's expensive.

764
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,741
[SPEAKER_06]: The more bling you want to buy for your bear, that shit gets expensive.

765
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:17,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare is coming out on both PC, PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and strangely enough, the DS.

766
00:51:20,006 --> 00:51:20,546
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

767
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Dora the Explorer, Dora Saves a Mermaid.

768
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,929

[SPEAKER_04]: What?

777
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:16,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have you know, I used to read my... Yes, yes.

780
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to see Koei's really getting that stuff out.

781
00:52:25,481 --> 00:52:28,802
[SPEAKER_04]: They're too busy working on more Dynasty Warriors games.

782
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is like Dynasty Warriors.

783
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:34,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just set in France instead, and you can play as Joan of Arc.

00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:47,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, seriously.

794
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:48,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was a ways off.

795
00:53:49,453 --> 00:53:49,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

796
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:55,597
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to enrich your life, you guess you could buy this game or a series of these games.

797
00:53:55,918 --> 00:54:00,941
[SPEAKER_04]: My French Coach, My Spanish Coach, My Word Coach, and also My Word Coach on the Wii.

[SPEAKER_04]: Those are other games that were on the DS.

799
00:54:03,343 --> 00:54:07,566
[SPEAKER_04]: But the hacking community will be creating my sex coach out of this game.

800
00:54:08,047 --> 00:54:09,288
[SPEAKER_04]: How about my Lamaze coach?

801
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:11,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, they are milking that franchise into the ground.

802
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:26,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually what you do in the game.

803
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:27,602
[SPEAKER_02]: You milk things.

804
00:54:27,642 --> 00:54:29,523
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fantastically mixed metaphor.

805
00:54:30,123 --> 00:54:32,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Seen It on Xbox 360 is coming out.

806

[SPEAKER_06]: It's about fucking time.

810
00:54:42,527 --> 00:54:44,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's about fucking time.

811
00:54:45,008 --> 00:54:45,568
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not it.

812
00:54:46,789 --> 00:54:52,211
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a game based off of the series The Office coming out on PC.

[SPEAKER_04]: The Sims 2, Teen Style with Stuff.

00:55:19,703 --> 00:55:19,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

825
00:55:21,742 --> 00:55:26,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, I think that might be it here.

826
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:29,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get some comments from chat room while you're doing that.

827
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:31,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat.orangeonestranger.com, live on this Sunday night.

[SPEAKER_06]: Macman says, go Diego, go, straight to hell.

829
00:55:36,394 --> 00:55:38,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget Diego, go Pyramid Head, go.

830
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:44,146

831
00:55:44,186 --> 00:55:46,748
[SPEAKER_02]: shows in reference to... Eureka's Castle is great.

832
00:55:46,848 --> 00:55:47,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I like pinwheels.

833
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:51,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't there a Eureka's Castle video game?

834
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:55,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Or better yet... I want my You Can't Do That on Television game.

835
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:02,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you have to, you know, make your way through the sausage factory and avoid the green slime and the pies.

836
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:04,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it should be known that I'm so right there.

837
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

838
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:09,424
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very Monty Python.

839
00:56:09,504 --> 00:56:12,546
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole show was like a spoof of Monty Python.

840
00:56:12,566 --> 00:56:13,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

841
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:13,726
Yeah.

842
00:56:16,027 --> 00:56:18,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, you could play as Barf.

843
00:56:18,648 --> 00:56:19,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had Alanis.

844
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:24,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like how that show was like borderline child cruelty, which is awesome.

845
00:56:25,877 --> 00:56:27,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and that's it for this week.

846
00:56:27,939 --> 00:56:29,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And a real quick tease for next week.

847
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you smarter than a fifth grader on the DS?

848
00:56:34,722 --> 00:56:35,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

849
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I beg not to comment.

850
00:56:36,983 --> 00:56:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do that in a video game, is what they could call it.

851
00:56:39,665 --> 00:56:40,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that'd be great.

852
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:42,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Who owns the license to that stuff?

853
00:56:42,526 --> 00:56:43,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone in Canada.

854
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, probably the Canadian Broadcasting Corp or something.

855
00:56:46,008 --> 00:56:50,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Canada, me wanty, you can't do that in a video game.

856

[SPEAKER_06]: Gimme.

00:58:43,698 --> 00:58:45,638
[SPEAKER_06]: You want me to do your own release dates while you go release?

878
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:46,378
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'll do them.

879
00:58:46,538 --> 00:58:46,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

880
00:58:47,378 --> 00:58:49,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to speak Lolcat, I guess.

881
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:51,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Failed.

882
00:58:51,379 --> 00:58:53,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the G4 Lolcat thing?

883
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

884
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:55,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was fantastic.

885
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,320
[SPEAKER_06]: You said G4 and did you see it?

886
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,581
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer's automatically no.

887
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:00,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they make YouTube for a reason.

888
00:59:00,961 --> 00:59:03,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the YouTube channel on my iPhone, by the way.

889
00:59:03,181 --> 00:59:04,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot to mention.

890
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:05,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I can watch Cowbell Hero at work.

891
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:09,243
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple games I forgot to mention that were coming out this week in the US.

892
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:10,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Christ!

893
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:11,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry!

894
00:59:11,324 --> 00:59:12,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking games are coming out this week!

895
00:59:12,824 --> 00:59:15,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest Monsters Joker on the DS.

896
00:59:16,045 --> 00:59:16,985
[SPEAKER_04]: That was coming out as well.

897
00:59:17,105 --> 00:59:19,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Empire Earth 3 on PC.

898
00:59:19,365 --> 00:59:20,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, look, you're done.

899
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:22,646
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't read them, they just got delayed to next week.

900
00:59:22,686 --> 00:59:23,486
[SPEAKER_06]: You can all thank Loki.

901
00:59:24,826 --> 00:59:25,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Loki.

902
00:59:26,086 --> 00:59:26,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

903
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:27,567
[SPEAKER_02]: My turn, please?

904
00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:28,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have the turn now?

905
00:59:28,967 --> 00:59:29,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you may.

906
00:59:30,887 --> 00:59:35,548
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 8th, Sam & Max episode 201, Ice Station Santa.

907
00:59:36,286 --> 00:59:36,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

908
00:59:37,967 --> 00:59:40,128
[SPEAKER_02]: On 9th, Beowulf on Xbox 360.

909
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:41,329
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

910
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Beowulf was like a story and you could read it.

911
00:59:45,632 --> 00:59:47,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's going to be a movie so you don't have to read it anymore.

912
00:59:47,853 --> 00:59:48,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The fuck?

913
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:49,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, whatever.

914
00:59:49,334 --> 00:59:50,234
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out on IMAX.

915
00:59:50,595 --> 00:59:51,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it'll be big.

916
00:59:51,775 --> 00:59:52,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go see it on IMAX.

917
00:59:52,816 --> 00:59:53,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see anything on IMAX.

918
00:59:55,298 --> 00:59:59,620
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 9th, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare on a bunch of stuff.

919
01:00:00,941 --> 01:00:02,402
[SPEAKER_02]: 9th, Dynasty Warriors Gundam.

920
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:20,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, 9th also, EA Playground, Endless Ocean, Gears of War on PC, Jackass the Game, whatever, King of Clubs, whatever, Lair, okay, NASCAR 2008, Chase for the Cup, if you, you know, happen to be a European redneck, I don't know.

921
01:00:21,968 --> 01:00:28,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how Jamie is suddenly combining her release dates with her one phrase impressions of the game, whether she's played it or not.

922
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:37,463
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a particular funny thing about NASCAR is that they're opening up a big NASCAR arena outside my hometown.

923
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:40,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get to go see it when I'm there.

924
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:43,667
[SPEAKER_06]: While you're on your way to Chick-fil-A?

925
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:45,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, no way.

926
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:46,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to Cracker Barrel.

927
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:47,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you're talking about.

928
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:49,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Cracker Barrel and Waffle House.

929
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:50,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Release dates?

930
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:50,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninth.

931
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:51,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick Toon.

932
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Try not to get shot by Kid Rock while you're at Waffle House.

933
01:00:54,432 --> 01:00:54,993
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

934
01:00:56,997 --> 01:00:58,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicktoons, Attack of the Toybots on Wii.

935
01:00:59,158 --> 01:01:00,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a cool name.

936
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:03,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninth, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008.

937
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:13,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can't have enough, you know, I guess bra and panty matches and, you know, steroidal men.

938
01:01:13,723 --> 01:01:15,744
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you really can't, actually.

939
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:16,284
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't.

940
01:01:16,444 --> 01:01:16,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't.

941
01:01:16,864 --> 01:01:17,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatroom, would you agree?

942
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:20,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there such thing as too much bra and panty match?

943
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:21,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't think so.

944
01:01:22,398 --> 01:01:25,939
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too much bra and panty in those too much bra and panty matches.

945
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:31,440
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, they could lose the bra and panty and I'd be fine.

946
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:36,702
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what game they need to make if they're going to do wrestling games?

947
01:01:36,762 --> 01:01:40,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the WWE ones because I like the customizing mode.

948
01:01:41,543 --> 01:01:43,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I fully would just pick random people and just make them.

949
01:01:44,544 --> 01:01:45,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But they need a luchador game.

950
01:01:47,725 --> 01:01:48,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing but luchadors.

951
01:01:49,725 --> 01:01:52,206
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you make your mask and, you know,

952
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:53,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Sabado Gigante

953
01:02:15,962 --> 01:02:20,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Sabato Higante is like this big clusterfuck of a game show meets a talk show.

954
01:02:20,346 --> 01:02:22,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like all of everything that exists.

955
01:02:22,848 --> 01:02:25,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's like telenovelas in it too.

956
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:30,353
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like all of what is great on TV compressed into like one three-hour show.

957
01:02:30,433 --> 01:02:33,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever seen the Mad TV sketch where it's like this Asian guy?

958
01:02:33,556 --> 01:02:39,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like mini-show with two guys or something like that, but it's like different shows.

959
01:02:39,721 --> 01:02:41,042
[SPEAKER_04]: They changed the theme of it.

960
01:02:41,182 --> 01:02:42,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like cooking show!

961
01:02:43,554 --> 01:02:44,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Drama Show!

962
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:46,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else game they need?

963
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: This is inspired after watching Human Tetris last night.

964
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:52,357
[SPEAKER_02]: They need Japanese TV show the game.

965
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:54,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Actdeft.

966
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:59,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft is reminding me that Sabado Higante is on Univision and not Telemundo.

967
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:00,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

968
01:03:04,302 --> 01:03:07,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever watched any Japanese game shows?

969
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:10,298
[SPEAKER_02]: or just some of the live variety shows.

970
01:03:10,638 --> 01:03:13,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw like Utada Hikaru on YouTube.

971
01:03:13,759 --> 01:03:14,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Freaking bizarre.

972
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,762
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to do a game that's like that or like Takeshi's Castle the game.

973
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:21,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy that.

974
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:35,990
[SPEAKER_06]: More news, please, because seriously, now this show is getting into, let's see, we've talked about Sabado Higante, bra and panty matches, and now we're just talking about release dates, so we need to get back into news.

975
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:37,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

976
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:46,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this week, as we mentioned, you know, of course, you're starting to see those Rock Band demo kits come to Best Buys.

977
01:03:46,694 --> 01:03:52,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some Best Buys, because some retarded Best Buy employees are starting to sell the demo kits like the actual game.

978
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:55,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking, hey, we only got one of these.

979
01:03:55,636 --> 01:03:57,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it out and sell it.

980
01:03:57,677 --> 01:04:01,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some idiot buys it, and then it ends up on eBay.

981
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:03,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's all over the internet.

982
01:04:03,918 --> 01:04:06,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Haha, I gots the Rock Band first sale.

983
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:07,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Firsties.

984
01:04:09,052 --> 01:04:12,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the biggest penis on the whole internet because I have Rock Band before you.

985
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:16,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, apparently people are selling the demo kits and people are actually buying them.

986
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:22,161
[SPEAKER_04]: The demo kit, actually, the drums kit is missing the kick drum.

987
01:04:25,263 --> 01:04:28,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, of course, it's a demo version of the game so it doesn't have all the songs.

988
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:32,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's really funny, if you want to

989
01:04:33,254 --> 01:04:36,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been relisted on eBay because originally they pulled it down.

990
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:37,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and they pulled it down again.

991
01:04:38,498 --> 01:04:40,820
[SPEAKER_04]: But last I checked it, the bidding was up to $770.

992
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:46,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, why would you pay $600 more for a game that's going to be out in a few weeks anyways?

993
01:04:47,305 --> 01:04:48,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not even the full game.

994
01:04:48,486 --> 01:04:49,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you're an idiot.

995
01:04:50,788 --> 01:04:54,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I wonder if I'm even really in the same human race as all these other people.

996
01:04:55,452 --> 01:04:56,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but yeah.

997
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:57,654
[SPEAKER_04]: You, out of the gene pool.

998
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:03,649
[SPEAKER_04]: This particular case, it was the Marina California Best Buy that

999
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:06,571
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold it to somebody for, it rang up as $180.

1000
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:11,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you're an idiot if you bought it for $180 and you deserve what you get.

1001
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:19,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, maybe you do want to pick up one of these demo kits, because apparently they're going to be hard to find come holiday.

1002
01:05:20,154 --> 01:05:27,835
[SPEAKER_04]: According to EA President John, I don't know, John, anyways, I'm not going to try to pronounce his last name.

1003
01:05:28,796 --> 01:05:30,616
[SPEAKER_04]: He's predicting that Rock Band bundles me.

1004
01:05:31,036 --> 01:05:33,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Being tough to come by for a while.

1005
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:38,622
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't be able to put enough inventory to meet the demand this fiscal or calendar year.

1006
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:51,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Ricky Tileo told investors, adding that those who don't buy at launch won't be getting one for Christmas unless you know someone at one of our retailers.

1007
01:05:52,752 --> 01:05:55,374
[SPEAKER_04]: What John forgot to mention to people is that...

1008
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:58,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you suppose that they're hard to find?

1009
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because the game is so immensely popular that people are going to be buying it like crazy?

1010
01:06:03,967 --> 01:06:06,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be, or it could be they didn't make enough.

1011
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:10,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Or it could be that they saw what happened with the Wii last year and they're like, we gotta do that.

1012
01:06:11,391 --> 01:06:13,592
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you see, here's a little funny thing about this.

1013
01:06:15,313 --> 01:06:21,677
[SPEAKER_04]: EA has never made a music game before, and they've never made music game controllers before.

1014
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:27,041
[SPEAKER_04]: and so they're having a little trouble making the music game controllers and guess what?

1015
01:06:27,802 --> 01:06:33,373
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of shortages because of that and because you pre-ordered one doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be getting one either.

1016
01:06:34,294 --> 01:06:35,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Think the Wii again.

1017
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:36,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

1018
01:06:37,236 --> 01:06:38,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero 3, yes.

1019
01:06:38,117 --> 01:06:38,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with that.

1020
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:39,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot, John.

1021
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:49,201
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's ever a music game coming out that requires a guitar, a drum, a ukulele, whatever the fuck, it will be... Sitar.

1022
01:06:49,561 --> 01:06:50,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Sitar.

1023
01:06:50,401 --> 01:06:51,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Sitar Hero.

1024
01:06:51,522 --> 01:06:58,924
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be very fucking hard to find because for some reason people have trouble making fake guitars.

1025
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:02,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you have one pre-ordered, awesome.

1026
01:07:02,966 --> 01:07:03,426
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't,

1027
01:07:04,685 --> 01:07:05,285
[SPEAKER_04]: You're fucked.

1028
01:07:06,806 --> 01:07:07,267
[SPEAKER_05]: You better wait.

1029
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:11,069
[SPEAKER_05]: You can just take a broom and stick some old arcade buttons on it.

1030
01:07:11,149 --> 01:07:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, it's a guitar.

1031
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:16,573
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be getting one of these, only because I have to lie, cheat, and steal.

1032
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:27,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you don't want to wait around, or if you aren't lucky enough to get your hands on a copy of Rock Band, you can always wait for Harmonix's next game.

1033
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to take lessons in reading.

1034
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix Harmonix

1035
01:07:49,696 --> 01:07:53,058
[SPEAKER_06]: So their next game will not have guitars.

1036
01:07:53,179 --> 01:07:57,061
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be revealing some secrets about the game at next year's Game Developers Conference.

1037
01:07:57,261 --> 01:07:58,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.

1038
01:07:59,163 --> 01:08:00,544
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to rip off DDR now.

1039
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:01,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1040
01:08:01,604 --> 01:08:02,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Go Harmonix.

1041
01:08:02,825 --> 01:08:03,726
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is what they said.

1042
01:08:03,926 --> 01:08:10,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, beats would not be authored by tech-savvy musicians, but would instead be algorithmically generated.

1043
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:11,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome.

1044
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:11,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Factory 2.

1045
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:15,674
[SPEAKER_06]: There won't be a dedicated peripheral for the game.

1046
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:16,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1047
01:08:17,015 --> 01:08:18,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Amplitude million.

1048
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:19,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1049
01:08:20,051 --> 01:08:23,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I would not mind a sequel to the Frequency Amplitude, you know.

1050
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:23,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be all for that.

1051
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:26,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's finish off that trilogy with a real awesome game.

1052
01:08:27,014 --> 01:08:29,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that they have the, you know, they can get some badass tracks in that.

1053
01:08:30,415 --> 01:08:30,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1054
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:32,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all for it.

1055
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:34,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they could just make Freeze pop the game.

1056
01:08:35,437 --> 01:08:36,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all for that, too.

1057
01:08:36,497 --> 01:08:39,138
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, let me take this opportunity to say, I will, uh,

1058
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:42,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Jump in here before Jamie reads her next story.

1059
01:08:42,664 --> 01:08:45,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Freeze Pop is in Sacramento tonight in OLR headquarters.

1060
01:08:45,584 --> 01:08:46,824
[SPEAKER_06]: They're playing a show downtown tonight.

1061
01:08:47,225 --> 01:08:48,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know this.

1062
01:08:48,405 --> 01:08:50,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God, they go on stage in like two hours.

1063
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, I wouldn't have been here if I had known that.

1064
01:08:53,886 --> 01:08:54,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Sucker.

1065
01:08:54,746 --> 01:08:55,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we are doing the show.

1066
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:58,307
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I have is my alarm on my phone.

1067
01:08:58,507 --> 01:09:00,307
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that, Science Genius Girl or something?

1068
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1069
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:04,008
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just sit here and wait, Jamie.

1070
01:09:04,388 --> 01:09:05,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, you better.

1071
01:09:05,968 --> 01:09:08,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Except that I have news about Guitar Hero.

1072
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:08,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

1073
01:09:09,301 --> 01:09:10,262
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually really cool.

1074
01:09:10,542 --> 01:09:10,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

1075
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:14,686
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh... I'd love to hear that cool news.

1076
01:09:15,687 --> 01:09:20,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready to... No, it's not Get Ready to Rock.

1077
01:09:20,592 --> 01:09:21,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the other one.

1078
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:22,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's Talk More Rock.

1079
01:09:22,734 --> 01:09:23,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1080
01:09:24,015 --> 01:09:25,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's my actual ringtone right now.

1081
01:09:26,117 --> 01:09:26,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1082
01:09:26,998 --> 01:09:30,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway... Oh, and... Money Python.

1083
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:32,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway... That was so worth the wait.

1084
01:09:33,284 --> 01:09:33,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, anyway...

1085
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my iPhone, I'm sorry.

1086
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:46,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So for anyone who is interested in the downloadable content for Guitar Hero 3, there has been a leak, which we hope is a real leak.

1087
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:58,367
[SPEAKER_02]: There is stuff listed as, let me see if I can, this thing is kind of hard for me to read.

1088
01:09:59,005 --> 01:10:01,927
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a picture taken off of a television.

1089
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:11,175
[SPEAKER_02]: But there were boss battle tracks listed, the ones you could pick and choose, so it was pretty interesting.

1090
01:10:11,535 --> 01:10:15,859
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great because you can't practice those in the game in practice mode, and it's pissing me off.

1091
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:17,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Because those boss battles are hard.

1092
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:25,367
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Slash Guitar Battle, Devil Went Down to Georgia, Putting Holes in Happiness, The Pretender, This is a Call.

1093
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:26,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all on there.

1094
01:10:28,038 --> 01:10:32,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those are unlocked from the soundtrack, if I remember right, like the Putting Holes in Happiness and stuff.

1095
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:39,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I almost bought the soundtrack just to, you know, see if, you know, how all that worked out.

1096
01:10:39,422 --> 01:10:43,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But, of course, I'm cheap and so I didn't.

1097
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:43,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

1098
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:44,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.

1099
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:51,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, basically that is actually paid unlock content because that stuff is unlocked with a code.

1100
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:54,447
[SPEAKER_06]: So, well, just in regards to like the Putting Holes in Happiness.

1101
01:10:54,467 --> 01:10:55,307
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not.

1102
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:03,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand corrected, my bad.

1103
01:11:05,316 --> 01:11:05,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Next story, please.

1104
01:11:06,397 --> 01:11:06,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1105
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:15,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Overlord, a game that I was playing quite a bit until Bioshock came out.

1106
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:19,360
[SPEAKER_04]: is getting some awesome download content.

1107
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, three pieces of awesome download content.

1108
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:31,745
[SPEAKER_04]: One, of course, is free, and it actually allows you to play a multiplayer split-screen co-op game, which is kind of cool.

1109
01:11:31,905 --> 01:11:36,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So, two overlords running around with 50 minions each, killing innocent people.

1110
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:41,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, two of the other packs will cost you some points.

1111
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:41,829
[SPEAKER_04]: No...

1112
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:43,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1113
01:12:11,235 --> 01:12:16,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a freaking copy of the game and I still haven't had a chance to play it because I've just been so distracted with everything else.

1114
01:12:16,196 --> 01:12:17,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't point and make evil eyes at me.

1115
01:12:17,896 --> 01:12:18,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give me evils.

1116
01:12:19,597 --> 01:12:22,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I could be selling that game for... Don't give me evils.

1117
01:12:23,037 --> 01:12:26,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I plan on playing it at some point.

1118
01:12:27,178 --> 01:12:33,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, last week on this program, I believe Loki reported that IPTV was going to be a part of the new fall update.

1119
01:12:33,339 --> 01:12:34,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it was a theory, okay?

1120
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just setting him up.

1121
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,805
[SPEAKER_06]: That theory was nuked this week as Microsoft said, oh shit, we better make a statement on this.

1122
01:12:42,345 --> 01:12:53,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And Microsoft came out and said, quote, Internet protocol television, IPTV features, will only be available from the Xbox 360 through a service provider who has deployed Xbox 360 with Microsoft Media Room services.

1123
01:12:53,476 --> 01:13:01,003
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an isolated incident where these features were inadvertently exposed while the customer's console was being serviced and is unrelated to the fall update.

1124
01:13:01,775 --> 01:13:02,556
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1125
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,311
[SPEAKER_04]: In the fall.

1126
01:13:23,511 --> 01:13:24,071
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's in the middle.

1127
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:25,252
[SPEAKER_06]: It is now fall.

1128
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:25,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Check the clock.

1129
01:13:26,012 --> 01:13:28,093
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I believe it's in the next few weeks.

1130
01:13:28,553 --> 01:13:29,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Next couple weeks should be when.

1131
01:13:29,894 --> 01:13:31,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I think last year was around the 12th or something like that.

1132
01:13:32,115 --> 01:13:35,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder what kind of cool shiz we're going to see in the updates since we're not seeing IPTV.

1133
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:36,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1134
01:13:36,457 --> 01:13:36,637
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1135
01:13:36,838 --> 01:13:37,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff.

1136
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:38,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yay.

1137
01:13:38,438 --> 01:13:39,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I love stuff.

1138
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I got some stuff.

1139
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:41,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

1140
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:42,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1141
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:43,461
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a salad?

1142
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:44,201
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1143
01:13:45,082 --> 01:13:45,462
[SPEAKER_02]: You ate it?

1144
01:13:45,522 --> 01:13:46,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It has an anime.

1145
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:47,963
[SPEAKER_02]: An anime?

1146
01:13:48,463 --> 01:13:48,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1147
01:13:48,944 --> 01:13:49,324
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1148
01:13:51,185 --> 01:13:51,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1149
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:57,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So for people who are fans of Blue Dragon, we get an anime release.

1150
01:13:58,117 --> 01:14:06,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, if Toriyama is involved in it, you know there's going to be an anime involved, which is why I wonder why we never got Chrono Trigger, but that's another story.

1151
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:12,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Blue Dragon is going to have episodes coming to Xbox Live for free.

1152
01:14:12,969 --> 01:14:16,572
[SPEAKER_02]: November 15th through January 1st, the episodes will all be there to download and

1153
01:14:17,371 --> 01:14:40,246
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's more of a promotional thing for the budget edition that's going to be coming out for 29.40 yen which is 26 bucks here in the US and the fourth volume of Blue Dragon Anime is going to be out on DVD this month and by the way you have to live in Japan to get that for free

1154
01:14:40,968 --> 01:14:41,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

1155
01:14:41,488 --> 01:14:46,249
[SPEAKER_06]: But does that trick still work where you can use a Japanese Yahoo account to sign in?

1156
01:14:46,709 --> 01:14:49,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do they block that shit?

1157
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:56,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember how for a while we were signing in on a Japanese account to download game demos that weren't out here and stuff?

1158
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:59,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that reminds me, I have to download the Guilty Gear 2 demo.

1159
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:00,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it still works.

1160
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:00,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you still use it?

1161
01:15:00,952 --> 01:15:03,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I thought a while they blocked that somehow.

1162
01:15:03,413 --> 01:15:04,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure they did.

1163
01:15:05,629 --> 01:15:07,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, they blocked it all right.

1164
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So they didn't do shit.

1165
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:10,873
[SPEAKER_06]: The Blue Dragon anime is only free in Japan.

1166
01:15:11,013 --> 01:15:12,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink, wink, wink, nudge, nuzz.

1167
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:15,537
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't have a Japanese Yahoo account or anything that you can sign up for.

1168
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:16,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even need a Japanese Yahoo account.

1169
01:15:17,038 --> 01:15:22,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a Hotmail account that's like LokiOLRJP or something like that.

1170
01:15:22,362 --> 01:15:23,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember what it was.

1171
01:15:23,663 --> 01:15:25,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody sign that address up for all the porn you can.

1172
01:15:25,985 --> 01:15:27,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really, really easy.

1173
01:15:27,426 --> 01:15:27,706
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

1174
01:15:27,786 --> 01:15:30,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't check that address ever, so it doesn't matter.

1175
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:34,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also have the internet, so I'll just...

1176
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:34,931
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

1177
01:15:53,806 --> 01:15:59,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, hardly anybody in America, unless they happen to be watching Nickelodeon in the mid-early 90s.

1178
01:15:59,449 --> 01:16:02,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was a fuckload of people, actually, in our generation.

1179
01:16:02,311 --> 01:16:04,191
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I know the fucking Tomorrow People.

1180
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:07,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Tomorrow People was like British sci-fi from the 70s.

1181
01:16:07,513 --> 01:16:15,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been around for a while, probably a complete and utter ripoff from X-Men, but still, it was really cool.

1182
01:16:15,397 --> 01:16:15,898
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1183
01:16:16,778 --> 01:16:18,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved 70s TV when I was a kid.

1184
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:21,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up watching The Jeffersons and The Electric Company.

1185
01:16:21,801 --> 01:16:22,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah?

1186
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:22,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1187
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:53,068
[SPEAKER_04]: but I've been watching the Tomorrow People on my iPhone alright sorry I'm reading something about later it's just a funny can you do now so we can end part A real quick there's a quote Miyamoto says wait until you see the Wii 5 years from now yay when they're going to finally support online fully and stuff oh I only have to wait 5 years awesome pulling off the wrapping slowly

1188
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:54,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

1189
01:16:57,919 --> 01:17:00,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so other fun stuff.

1190
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:11,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Pirates vs. Ninjas, Dodgeball, such an awesome name for a game, I guess, has been confirmed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1191
01:17:12,005 --> 01:17:18,788
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they haven't really nailed down an exact time frame, but early 2008 is when it's expected, and

1192
01:17:19,545 --> 01:17:26,209
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll truly be able to see who is better, pirates or ninjas, in the ancient art of dodgeball.

1193
01:17:26,749 --> 01:17:27,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Or zombies.

1194
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:28,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Or zombies.

1195
01:17:29,051 --> 01:17:36,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we're ignoring a very important class of, you know, of, uh, you know... Pinjas?

1196
01:17:37,456 --> 01:17:38,336
[SPEAKER_02]: No, cowboys.

1197
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:40,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck cowboys!

1198
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:41,838
[SPEAKER_04]: They ain't got nothing.

1199
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:42,739
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fucking pansies.

1200
01:17:42,759 --> 01:17:44,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninja versus pirates versus cowboys.

1201
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Horse-riding losers.

1202
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:49,363
[SPEAKER_05]: We never saw movies about gay ninjas or gay pirates.

1203
01:17:50,543 --> 01:17:51,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Not counting Johnny Depp.

1204
01:17:53,104 --> 01:17:53,904
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't gay.

1205
01:17:53,944 --> 01:17:56,745
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just, you know, Keith Richards.

1206
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:01,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1207
01:18:03,967 --> 01:18:04,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

1208
01:18:05,067 --> 01:18:08,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm looking forward to seeing the ultimate pirate versus ninja showdown.

1209
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:11,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, I think this is a brilliant idea for a video game.

1210
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:12,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Pirates versus ninjas.

1211
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:13,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's finally doing it.

1212
01:18:14,771 --> 01:18:16,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1213
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I lost my train of thought.

1214
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:36,971
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn you.

1215
01:18:37,572 --> 01:18:40,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was going to say Pirates vs. Ninjas.

1216
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the dodgeball game that they had on the NES back in the day.

1217
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:44,818
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was awesome.

1218
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can get it on the DS.

1219
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the remake?

1220
01:18:47,461 --> 01:18:48,802
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a Cuneo game.

1221
01:18:48,862 --> 01:18:49,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1222
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:50,864
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awesome.

1223
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:53,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put Pirates and Ninjas in that game.

1224
01:18:53,286 --> 01:18:54,047
[SPEAKER_06]: How awesome is that?

1225
01:18:55,268 --> 01:18:55,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1226
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:57,209
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw says, Oh, I don't know.

1227
01:18:57,289 --> 01:19:00,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Having cowboys would give the Pirates and Ninjas an unfair advantage.

1228
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:01,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Cowboys use guns.

1229
01:19:01,573 --> 01:19:02,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So do Pirates.

1230
01:19:03,511 --> 01:19:05,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Vampires use swords.

1231
01:19:05,612 --> 01:19:08,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they have ninja stars.

1232
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:14,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I think that the two enemy classes should be ninja and cowboy.

1233
01:19:15,014 --> 01:19:16,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have the pirate who's the hybrid.

1234
01:19:17,635 --> 01:19:18,835
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, they can swim.

1235
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:20,416
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're a good pirate.

1236
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:21,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Nerd!

1237
01:19:23,837 --> 01:19:24,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly...

1238
01:19:25,288 --> 01:19:25,688
[SPEAKER_06]: The N-Gage

1239
01:19:55,001 --> 01:19:56,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you developing for the N-Gage?

1240
01:19:56,622 --> 01:19:56,782
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1241
01:19:57,803 --> 01:20:03,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently EA, Capcom, and Vivendi are all stepping up to develop for the N-Gage.

1242
01:20:04,347 --> 01:20:04,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

1243
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:09,290
[SPEAKER_06]: The N-Gage service is coming soon.

1244
01:20:10,845 --> 01:20:16,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, coming to you right now is the classic video game of the week.

1245
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:26,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, DarkSakura picks out a game from the archives of history that maybe I didn't know about before and says, damn it, you should be playing this game.

1246
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:30,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, please reveal for us your classic game of the week.

1247
01:20:31,071 --> 01:20:32,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounded like you said DarkSakura.

1248
01:20:34,381 --> 01:20:35,502
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1249
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:56,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1250
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting some sound here from Cyberbots.

1251
01:20:58,502 --> 01:21:00,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell the kids about Cyberbots while I get the sound here.

1252
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:05,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyberbots is a fighting game that uses Mecha.

1253
01:21:06,388 --> 01:21:15,174
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can choose different classes of Mecha and then each of them have three different ones that are in that class that have different types of weaponry.

1254
01:21:15,654 --> 01:21:19,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fairly customizable how you play it.

1255
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:24,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had these little cinema cutscenes and a cool storyline.

1256
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:25,402
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1257
01:21:26,818 --> 01:21:27,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle Fighter

1258
01:21:55,999 --> 01:22:06,982
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, her, uh, she has the best robot in the entire game, the Super 8, which is a big octopus robot, so it's pretty cool.

1259
01:22:07,342 --> 01:22:17,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this game also had one of the best, um, hidden characters was Mecha Gouki, which is basically, you know, Gouki is Akuma over here from the Street Fighter series.

1260
01:22:18,246 --> 01:22:22,807
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a Gouki robot that has all of his attacks and everything, it was pretty awesome.

1261
01:22:24,046 --> 01:22:36,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but also there was, uh, you know, for anyone now who goes back and plays Puzzle Fighter and you're here to see Devil Let's Go, you know, never heard of it, still to know Cyberbot is Capcom's number one game, that's what it is.

1262
01:22:36,938 --> 01:22:42,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually got a special edition that came with, like, a book in this big box, and it was really cool, um, on Saturn.

1263
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:50,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually still find the game for fairly reasonable, but it's, to me, it's actually, I think, one of Capcom's best games.

1264
01:22:51,516 --> 01:22:51,836
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1265
01:23:14,847 --> 01:23:16,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It was arcade and Saturn.

1266
01:23:16,568 --> 01:23:19,791
[SPEAKER_06]: More Sega love from DarkSakura.

1267
01:23:20,011 --> 01:23:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Saturn was one of the best systems.

1268
01:23:21,552 --> 01:23:23,053
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of overlooked games on the Saturn.

1269
01:23:23,073 --> 01:23:25,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I did find related to Sega?

1270
01:23:25,676 --> 01:23:28,118
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many ITX computers that people are building.

1271
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:32,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone built one out of a Sega CD and a Genesis.

1272
01:23:32,761 --> 01:23:34,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking on the site.

1273
01:23:34,363 --> 01:23:34,963
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.

1274
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:38,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine is collecting dust, by the way.

1275
01:23:39,537 --> 01:23:43,220
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, that's going to bring part A of our show tonight to a close.

1276
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:51,206
[SPEAKER_06]: But we will be back very shortly with more of Orange Lounge Radio because we tape two halves in one night here on Sunday night and then release it twice throughout the week.

1277
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:53,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get more Orange Lounge Radio to listen to throughout the week.

1278
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:58,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back with a little more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1279
01:23:58,471 --> 01:24:03,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1280
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:08,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
