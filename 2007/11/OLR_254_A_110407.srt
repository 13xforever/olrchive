Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, November 4th, 2007, Nanhunt 2 proves a pot of controversy all its own.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Could Oblivion be headed online?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We discuss the ultimate dodgeball showdown of Pirates vs. Ninjas.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Pretty much like everything to do with video games, you know. That doesn't suck.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How are you doing, Jamie? And your mic is off.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I turned it on. There we go, now we hear you.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I just turned my mic on again.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Maybe it was stuck. It was sticking. Maybe your mic got all sticky.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I didn't do it.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to eat my salad.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well then you can eat your salad very soon. As soon as we do gaming weeks.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Forget that, I'm going to straighten my salad.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Fine. While she dives in, I'm going to introduce. Will you show Op11 your lovely salad from Quizmos before you dine in there?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We webcast her out on the webcam here at operator11.com. There's her lovely salad.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Doesn't make for great radio though, I apologize. So instead I will introduce the one and only Loki.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hello.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How are you doing, Loki?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm doing okay because I figured out, I think, what I did wrong.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What do you think you did wrong?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Because I'm trying to update my firmware of my modchip. I installed it in my Wii and I think I had the toggle switch switched wrong.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's off instead of on.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I would like to point out that DarkSakura is tossing her salad in the corner.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's hot.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to actually toss DarkSakura's salad right here on Op11Cam. Look at that.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That reminds me, I got to get in the chair.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will explain what I'm doing.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When you get the salads that have lids on them, you can actually get away with using less dressing if you pour however much you want on, close the lid and shake it up really well.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh yeah, that's what I always do.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So for anybody who is changing their lifestyle to eat healthier, there's a hint for you.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Tossing your salad can be good for you.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So you don't have to dip your salad like the books tell you to because that's retarded.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Alright, anyhow.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Books are retarded.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm sure we'll hear more about Loki's modship questionably legal activities a little later, but in the meantime I want to introduce a guest here in studio tonight.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Tonight we were going to be having Rice Princess and Extifer here, but they backed out at the last second.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Something about a flat tire.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh yeah, I'm supposed to believe there's a flat tire.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I'm kidding.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Sorry to hear that, but we do have Puppy is here tonight.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yay.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They could have meant flat tire beer.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They could have meant they had to go drink this beer.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I like that thought.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Very good.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Alright.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's fat tire, not flat tire.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It depends on when you buy the beer.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Maybe they misheard it.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Maybe somebody made a typo.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Alright, because I got the message on MySpace.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When did MySpace replace email?

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's what I want to know.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Like, nobody sends me email anymore.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I just get messages on MySpace.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I have something better than email.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh my god.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Jamie whips out the iPhone.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Put it on camera.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Jamie bots herself an iPhone.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It doesn't have your number on it or anything, does it?

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Jamie bots herself an iPhone.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You joined the army of those that have these.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What made you decide to take the plunge?

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
My husband did.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We grabbed them and said we want these.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Really?

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And you were like, oh no, please stop, don't.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, what happened is I was going to get a Blackberry.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And being that I do all this business and I need to have a planner on me and I need to

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
have something that I can keep track of all of my work and my dates and all that.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I was going to get a Blackberry.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
On top of that, I'm a texting fiend.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, I figured it would be cost effective for me to buy a Blackberry instead of going out

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and buying a PDA.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, we look at them and the activation on them and everything ended up that it would

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
have been more reasonable or about equal when we did all the math that I could get an iPhone.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Of course, my husband doesn't want to be shown up by his wife.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So, he had to get one too.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I think this is highly ironic that he's like, we need to watch money, we need to watch

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
money.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's break out the gold card and buy iPhones.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Still a wise purchase though.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You see, you guys say that women defy all logic.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, hell no.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hell no.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And let's of course introduce the always present other guests on our program, the Chat Room.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to be when we tape live here on this Sunday evening,

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
which feels like a very late Sunday evening today, thanks to Daylight Savings Time.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It feels like later than it should.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And it got dark early and all that stuff.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Daylight Savings Time enabled me to stay up until 5 AM.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, I was up until 5 too.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But anyway, we'll get into that.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Were you playing with your iPhone all night?

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Were you tossing your salad all night?

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What were you doing?

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
She's chewing.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Playing Ragnarok.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, addict.

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Alright.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I could have guessed that.

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to introduce the chat.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's see.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We're going to chat.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's see some comments here.

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Xenocore, we'll start off tonight, says, Dark Sakura is tossing her own salad.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Simply amazing.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is she a contortionist?

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Dark Sakura is a woman of many talents.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Not only is she like a classic gaming fiend, but she is a salad connoisseur.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Except I don't think that's very good to put lunch meat in your salad.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is a little bit weird.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
WonderDogHerald also splurged a purchase this week.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I got my refurbed Zune from Woot.com this past week.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a baboo.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You don't hear a lot about Zunes.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I love Woot.com.

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's the best site ever.

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Woot.com is pretty fucking woot.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, it makes me say woot.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've never bought anything on there yet, but I always get there.

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Whenever I see something I actually want, it's too late.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It was gone.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I almost bought steak knives on Woot.com.

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why do you need knives?

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Because, okay, we have the same.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
For eating steak.

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, not that I eat a lot of steak, but whenever I chop vegetables, I like to use steak knives.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
When she decides to chop and then toss her own salad.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know what?

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How old are we again?

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The steak knives that we have are the same ones that Dan had when I moved in with him 10 years ago.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, yeah.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So you need some knife upgrades.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want a set of Gen 2 dinner knives.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You need to go to the weapon vendor.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Last time I bought knives, I chopped off the end of my finger.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dude, I was there when that happened, I think.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, you weren't.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No, but wasn't that when we lived together?

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm thinking of something else.

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I must be thinking of a deep fryer incident.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, you cut yourself on the knife using a steak knife to open boxes.

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, that was me.

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was using a steak knife to open boxes.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was preparing.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Actually, it was about maybe a year ago.

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It was around Halloween, I thought.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Maybe not.

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know.

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Anyways, it was around Halloween about a year ago, actually.

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It was a year from October 30th because I had bought a brand new knife and I was chopping

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
flat leaf parsley and not doing it properly and I severed the tip of my finger off.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And then I had to get a bandage put on there and the next day I came into work and someone

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
asked me if that's my costume and I'm like, you're an idiot.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, finger mummy.

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's my costume.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Finger mummy.

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I mean, come on.

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know.

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Crazy bandage man.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Give me some candy.

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It was funny, though, because I'm like, ow.

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Or I'm like, I cut myself.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you okay?

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm like, I don't think so.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They come over and there's blood going all over.

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It was fun.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just had a flashback to UHF.

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You get to drink from the fire hose.

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, the guy doing the carpentry and sawing off his fingers.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Ow.

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I just want to point out as well in our chat room, ShadowNextGen is bragging, I got the

186
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
$100 HD DVD player at Walmart.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Did you hear about that?

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Walmart's selling HD DVD players for $100 to try and push the HD DVD format.

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Sadly, I was in Walmart this week to buy a wireless GameCube controller.

190
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Actually, just a GameCube controller, because I needed one right away, because that's when

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I thought that I'd have my mod ship installed by Friday, and fortunately it took a little

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
longer than I thought.

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But yeah, Walmart sucks.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Actually, I might put in the money for one of those if they're still selling them before

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I go to Alabama.

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But then my house would be the ultimate high definition entertainment home.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, if you have a 360, you can buy a $199 HD DVD player.

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Or I could spend $100 for a dedicated HD DVD player.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can actually use that on a PC, though.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ooh.

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think if you plug it in the USB slot.

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Well, I might be getting a Vio anyway.

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We're either getting a Vio or an iMac if we buy something put together already.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All right, nerds, we've got to get the talk back to games, because we're already about

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
10 minutes from the show.

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then I can play all the Loom I want.

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
All right.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There we go.

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's get into our gaming week.

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Dark Sakura, what have you been playing this week?

211
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ragnarok.

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Again?

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm working on getting more characters to level 90-ish.

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have one at 92 now.

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And then I also looked at Guild Wars, but I didn't play, because my friend who I would

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
play Guild Wars with now works graveyard.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You just kind of looked at it.

219
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You were like, hmm, it's still there.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It is nice.

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's there.

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's still.

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No scratches or anything?

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And Dan's been playing Phoenix Wright a lot of it.

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like, I always hear the music.

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He's like, you're playing Phoenix Wright, aren't you?

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
OK.

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,560
And I am, though, going to be stealing the PSP, though, now that he's done with Rondo

231
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
of Blood.

232
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,800
And I'll be playing the hell out of that, because it's coming with me to Alabama.

233
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I don't care.

234
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Oh, my God.

235
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not going to be able to play Ragnarok when I'm in Alabama.

236
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
OMG.

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320
See, by that powerful iPhone can't run Ragnarok.

238
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:58,360
Well, I can go on my LiveJournal on my, posting on LiveJournal on the iPhone, by the way,

239
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
is ass.

240
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,240
It's not what the iPhones are for.

241
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,600
iPhones are for phoning.

242
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,880
And it has an iPod on it, so I can listen to stuff.

243
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,240
You can listen to the Ragnarok soundtrack.

244
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,720
You know, when I actually installed the game, I didn't install the music in it.

245
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
Why did you do that?

246
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,560
I just didn't feel like it.

247
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,160
Because, you know, the music takes up a lot of space, and I'm playing on my Lappy.

248
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,760
Is your laptop that crunched for space?

249
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Not really.

250
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,980
Not now that I have my portable hard drive, but, you know, I just don't want to bother

251
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
with it.

252
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,800
But, you know, I did actually play some of the games on the Homestar Runner site.

253
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Does that count?

254
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Sure.

255
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Why not?

256
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I was playing Trogdor.

257
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Flash games are awesome.

258
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
You know what you could always do?

259
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,840
You could be larping when you're in Alabama, and you could pretend that you're in Ragnarok.

260
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,400
You know, you could be all, Hail!

261
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm here to kick you in the face, and then I'll ban you!

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ban you forever!

263
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What?

264
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I used to larp in Alabama.

265
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,160
I played live-action vampire when I was, you know, freshly in college.

266
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,760
You're not supposed to admit to that.

267
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
Yeah, but I'm recovered.

268
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,240
You know, the first step of acceptance is...

269
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,280
Admitting you have a problem?

270
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
All right.

271
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Oh, yeah.

272
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,720
I admitted I have a problem.

273
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,840
I moved.

274
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,560
Rama is reminding us of the best part of the larp.

275
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,240
This is the part where I run up to Jamie and go, heal, please!

276
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,240
No!

277
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
What?

278
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
Prawns once, please.

279
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,320
Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, this is why.

280
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,600
I don't play Priest, huh?

281
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,720
Except I'm playing a Crusader and people come up to my Crusader and go, heal, please.

282
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Cuz Crusaders can heal.

283
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Kick them in the face.

284
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
All right, let's move on.

285
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,920
Loki, how was your gaming week?

286
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,840
It was okay, actually.

287
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:03,000
Once again, I did not play any of my Ratchet and Clank Future, Tools of Destruction, untrunked

288
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,220
the game, but didn't touch it, so I don't know when I'm gonna play my Playstation 3.

289
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,520
When I played, what was it, God of War Chains of Olympus, a demo for that, it's actually

290
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
pretty cool.

291
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,360
I was very surprised, cuz I thought, you know, hey, with one analog stick, how the fuck are

292
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,400
they gonna do this?

293
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,600
But it worked really well, so looking forward to the full game when it comes out.

294
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,520
Definitely worth checking out the demo if you can, however, though, you have to be part

295
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,400
of that stupid Playstation Underground crap that I signed up for a long time ago and they

296
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,440
keep sending me stuff, so I keep playing it.

297
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Then let's see, other than that, I played a little bit of Half-Life 2, some more Portal

298
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
for that.

299
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
That was fun.

300
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,240
Finally figured out what the weighted companion cube is, so now I get all the jokes and they're

301
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,520
not funny.

302
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,160
And let's see, what else?

303
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:10,600
Oh, I also played some Halo 3, actually, over, you know, Halloween, and we played over live,

304
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,600
cuz I don't really play much over live, but we went over to a friend's house and for Halloween,

305
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,300
we played Halo 3 while my wife and my friend's wife were playing Liar's Dice from Pirates

306
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
of the Caravan.

307
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:29,280
Halo 3 for Halloween, that infection playlist was fun, yeah, except we didn't really do

308
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
that.

309
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,160
No, wait, no, I'm sorry, I take that back, we didn't play over Halloween because the

310
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,920
Halloween party was last Saturday, so never mind, I already talked about that, so, no,

311
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,240
I did not play Halo 3, in fact, I did not hook up my 360 to live at all, but I will

312
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,440
assume you're playing Simpsons, the game, because that looks awesome.

313
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,840
Although it's getting mediocre reviews, you know.

314
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,680
I don't care, and you know what other game got mediocre reviews?

315
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,480
Earth Defense Force 2017, and I still have to go back and finish that damn game cuz motherfucking

316
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,400
can't beat the Inferno mode on that, I can't wait.

317
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,420
That's one of the things that I got the mod chip on my Wii for, which I did buy a mod

318
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:13,640
chip, by the way, it's CycloWiz version 2, I guess, one fucking bitch of a mod chip that

319
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,320
put on a Wii, and of course, I have no experience whatsoever in soldering, so you can imagine

320
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
how fun that must have been for me, I opened up and I'm like, holy shit, I'm not gonna,

321
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,800
this thing's gonna break.

322
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Did you burn yourself at all?

323
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,040
I did not burn myself at all, but I was just so stressed out all week because I had, it

324
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,040
literally, cuz I took it to work to do it, cuz first off, I didn't want my wife really

325
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,920
knowing that I was doing it right away, because she would have said, you're gonna break that

326
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,080
thing, and you know, I didn't wanna have anything to do with that, plus if you've looked at

327
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,000
my computer room, there's no way I can solder in there, although I did last night.

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,240
Heaven forbid someone get between Mrs. Loki and her Excite truck.

329
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,640
Oh god, I was so afraid, I'm like, this thing better work when I'm done, cuz she's gonna

330
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,240
wanna play Excite truck, and holy shit, no, but, yeah.

331
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,680
That's honestly the first time I've ever heard you admit to fear.

332
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,260
No, it's just scary, but anyways, so I actually had it broken open, like, in our conference

333
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:14,680
room for like Thursday and Friday, just, you know, strewn about the giant table in there,

334
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,160
so I could work on it, and I did get it soldered finally, and it worked, and it powered on,

335
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,360
I put it all back together, I installed this toggle switch on it so you can update it,

336
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,480
got it home, finally went to try it this morning to update it, it wouldn't turn on.

337
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,140
I was like, shit, what the fuck happened now?

338
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,000
So I started to take it apart again, tried the switch again, and it worked, and I don't

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,080
know why, you know, something in there must have jiggled or whatever to ground it out

340
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,720
or something, so now it's working, but I don't have all the screws in the system, but that's

341
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,400
fine, I'm going to leave it alone, and it should be fine, but it looks extremely ghetto

342
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,120
now because there's, you know, a wire going up the side of it that's taped on there with

343
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,280
black electrical tape, and it just looks so ghetto, but you know what, I don't give a

344
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,760
shit because I'm going to be able to play Super Mario Galaxy a few weeks early.

345
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,800
And kids, don't try this at home.

346
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,760
But the other thing I'm actually, you know, to go back to my story...

347
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,840
I want to point out Loki's only doing this for research purposes only.

348
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,240
Well, that and the tryout import games, because I don't want to buy another Wii, besides I

349
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,400
wouldn't be able to find another Wii.

350
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,480
Anyways, so one of the things I did want to play when I first, when I get it all hooked

351
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,040
up is the first Simple Series game on the Wii, which is that kart racing game, so that

352
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
should be fun.

353
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,620
And I know later on they're going to add some more to the Simple Series, so that's kind

354
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,200
of what I'm looking forward to with this mod chip.

355
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,720
Other than that though, today though when I left, I think I figured out what I did wrong,

356
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,120
but it does play Excite Trucks, so crisis averted, for now.

357
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Until it breaks.

358
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,400
The other thing, and we'll get into this a little bit later, I played Manhood 2 on the

359
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,120
PSP, and once we get into the story a little bit later on I'll explain, you can hack the

360
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
hell out of that game.

361
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,240
And I'm sure it was a completely unaltered retail version of the game that you would

362
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,240
never think of reading about all these hack and crack stories and doing this to your precious

363
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
copy of the game.

364
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,680
And Rockstar never intended for that to happen.

365
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,940
Totally didn't have like a modded PSP or anything to do that, I'm totally serious.

366
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,080
Completely serial.

367
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Alright.

368
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,840
My gaming week has been a lot of wow, I've been playing a lot of PVP, I'm almost exalted

369
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,840
in Alterac Valley, let's just put it that way, hey I'm trying to get my PVP here, what

370
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,800
can I say, I've been playing a lot of PVP.

371
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,720
Outside of that Guitar Hero 3, which I've played a lot more of, last week I didn't really

372
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
want to say a lot about it because I hadn't played much, but now I've played a lot of

373
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,960
the game, and it is a worthy sequel, I think is the best way I can sum it up.

374
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,200
I mean, you know, I want to jump up and go, it's the best game in the series, but...

375
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
It's not.

376
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Yeah, it's kind of not, I mean, but it brings enough new stuff to the table, and I just

377
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,360
think so many people were afraid that Neversoft was going to screw it up, and I don't think

378
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
they did.

379
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
I mean, it's a pretty worthy success in my opinion.

380
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,240
They fell short in a few places in terms of note charts and difficulty and some of the

381
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,640
design aspects.

382
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
What are your bitches with the Guitar Hero 3?

383
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,760
Well, for one, the controllers you designed, way too sensitive for it.

384
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,880
Some of the design stuff on the notes and the note stream coming down, there's some

385
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,600
stuff you're used to in Guitar Hero 2 and 1, like when the notes jump up on the board

386
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,800
when you activate star power, it doesn't happen in 3, and it's hard to tell when you activate

387
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,440
it, just because the only thing that happens is it changes colors.

388
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
True.

389
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,120
And then some of the character designs, meh.

390
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,440
They took out Pandora, which made me sad, because she was cool.

391
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,800
And then some of the, I mean, it's part of the Heart Midori, I don't care what she says,

392
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
the Heart Midori song.

393
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,600
As soon as I saw that character when I opened up the game, I knew that was who we were going

394
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
to play.

395
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,360
Are you guys actually saying that you play Guitar Hero for the characters?

396
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,600
I mean, that's like playing Karaoke Revolution for the characters.

397
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
It's fun though.

398
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,680
Jamie says she played Rock Band.

399
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,360
Let me get to that in a minute, because I had a Rock Band experience too.

400
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,140
Let's see, so I Heart Midori.

401
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,140
The songs are fun.

402
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,780
I beat the game on medium, because I'm not that great at Guitar Hero, but I'm working

403
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,200
my way through on hard now, and then I'll work up to expert.

404
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,080
But here's what Guitar Hero 3 has that the other games didn't have.

405
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,040
Live, online, competitive play, which is actually a lot of fun.

406
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,840
I played with one of my friends, and we were playing some co-op mode, and you know, I couldn't

407
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,080
really play co-op mode in Guitar Hero 2, because nobody ever really came over with their guitar.

408
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,680
So it's kind of a, it's a really nice feature.

409
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,120
I haven't done it on live yet, I've just been practicing on hard mode, just to kind of get

410
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,640
back into it, since I haven't played Guitar Hero in almost a year.

411
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,720
Dude in Guitar Hero 3 has raining blood, I mean.

412
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
Don't even get me started on that shit.

413
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,120
And Guitar Hero 3 has the most kickass cutscenes ever.

414
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
The cartoons are awesome.

415
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,920
So I really consider this game a worthy successor, and I'm curious to see where it goes in Guitar

416
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Hero 4.

417
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,640
I think it shows that they can get away, they can milk a fourth game out of this franchise

418
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
somehow.

419
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
So I'm curious to see what they do.

420
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Oh, just a fourth game?

421
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Yeah, okay.

422
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
And then some.

423
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
So I have fun with that.

424
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,460
Oh, plus the whole internet thing, you know, it ties into the internet.

425
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,960
It's been a little clunky, because, like, my stats are not updating at all, and it took

426
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,040
me like four days just to get my stupid account linked, because they've been having a lot

427
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
of problems.

428
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,340
But it's hard for me to kind of hold that against the game, because I see that as something

429
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,680
really ambitious, where you think about, how many other games have that kind of functionality?

430
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,800
Halo 3, and that's all I can think of, you know?

431
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,400
All the games, because all your live accounts are tied into, you know, you can bring them

432
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,120
up on your PC and stuff like that.

433
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,920
But the Guitar Hero thing has the leaderboards, and you can make your own little clan online,

434
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,760
and have a message form, and I'll tell you more about the O.L. Army Guitar Hero Band

435
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,400
in a minute, and all that, and I think that's kind of cool.

436
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
Even if it's been kind of clunky these first couple weeks, I'm hoping that, you know, in

437
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,380
a couple weeks it will smooth out, and things will run very smoothly.

438
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,640
It's certainly ambitious, and, I don't know, I don't hold it against the game, because

439
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,600
I see that as a bonus, not a necessity.

440
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,420
And it's certainly something that Harmonix wouldn't have had the resources to do on their

441
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
own.

442
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
I guess that's true.

443
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,320
So, anyway, I recommend Guitar Hero 3 if you're a fan of music games, and you like the first

444
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,560
two games, which I'm sure most people by now have come in contact with one of the games

445
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,560
at some point.

446
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,000
Also, I have been playing randomly.

447
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,560
I went over, William's cousin had a birthday, and he has a Wii, and we went and played Big

448
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,260
Brain Academy on the Wii, which is like, I guess, the brain training game on the Wii.

449
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,820
It's fun, it's another, you know, mini game collection, the kind of game that's easily

450
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,640
accessible by anyone, but here's the thing, there's not enough mini games.

451
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,380
I mean, I like some of the party modes, I thought the competitive mode where you work

452
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,040
your way through the mini games as fast as you can against other people, you know, within

453
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,540
the same room was kind of fun, but there wasn't enough variety in the games.

454
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,120
It needed like twice as many mini games as it actually has.

455
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,580
There's nothing fun about competitive math.

456
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,360
Not really, especially, you know, there's that thing where you have to pop the balloons

457
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,680
from lowest to highest, right?

458
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:05,320
Well, in this one mode, in expert mode, it's fractions, and I about cried when I had to

459
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,980
do that, because I'm like, oh my god, I have to do long division in my head?

460
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
This is horrible.

461
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,360
So, they call it Big Brain Academy for a reason, I suppose.

462
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,720
Try Before You Buy Big Brain Academy, because it's very limited.

463
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,680
If you have young ones, though, I bet they'd get a kick out of it, it would be fun.

464
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
How about this?

465
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,360
Spend your $50 on something better.

466
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
I hate that that's a lot of money.

467
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
It's a brain training game.

468
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
That is a lot of money for this game.

469
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,000
A brain training game on the Wii.

470
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,680
You're an idiot if you bought it.

471
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,720
You know what I do to train my brain?

472
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,160
I read.

473
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,640
I study things.

474
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,120
You can.

475
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,880
I don't need a game to help my brain.

476
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Rock Band.

477
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Jamie, you wanted to talk about Rock Band real quick.

478
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
Okay.

479
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,720
Dan and I went to Best Buy, because we were going to pick up Spider-Man 3, which actually

480
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,320
we ended up getting a better deal at Target anyway, because Best Buy had a two-disc thing

481
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,880
and Target had a three-disc thing for like $2 less, but anyway, I digress.

482
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,320
But they had the demo for Rock Band sitting out and it was just, okay, the guitars were

483
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,160
both destroyed and of course Dan went right for them, but the drum set was pretty cool

484
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,640
and it was a lot of fun.

485
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,920
I made him play Weezer because I love Weezer, so it was really cool.

486
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,560
I probably went to the same Best Buy you did at one point this week, because I had to buy

487
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,400
the Twin Peaks Gold Box Edition, which they didn't have at Best Buy, I had to go somewhere

488
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,540
else to get it, but anyway, nevertheless, I did see the Rock Band set up, but some kids

489
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,280
were playing and kind of monopolizing it and I didn't really want to jump in there, so

490
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,480
I just kind of watched.

491
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,280
It certainly looks kind of slick.

492
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,780
I like the backgrounds and stuff, it looks like fun, so I'll be probably picking that

493
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,780
up when it comes out.

494
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,320
I really like the little drum, you know, where you could freestyle a little bit, you know,

495
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
where you could ad-lib.

496
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
I didn't see that part.

497
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
That's kind of cool.

498
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:56,060
Well, yeah, it'll bring it up to where all of the lines are lit up and you can pretty

499
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,720
much free play on those measures.

500
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,400
It was really cool.

501
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,760
Let's see, what else did I play this week?

502
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I think that's about it.

503
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
I thought there was one other thing.

504
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,120
Oh, I helped William set up his new PSP and that was about it.

505
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
So there we go, our gaming weeks.

506
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,640
So let's move on then and we'll talk a little bit about housekeeping and I promised a little

507
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,620
bit ago I would talk about our Guitar Hero 3 band.

508
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:27,760
If you search for OLR in the tour groups on the Orange Mountains Radio website, it'll

509
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,400
take you right to our OLR band, which I'm happy to say is in the top 100 bands right

510
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
now.

511
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,520
Number 76 as of an hour and a half ago.

512
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Rockin'.

513
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, actually a lot of people, because I plugged it in our live journal community,

514
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,680
our MySpace, or maybe I'll put another MySpace bulletin up tonight, I try to put it everywhere

515
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,280
I could think of where people would see it and it seems to be working because we've gotten

516
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,400
a handful of people to join and it's already put us in the top 100, but I will not rest

517
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,520
until we're in the top 10, which will take a lot of work.

518
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
We're going to be not resting for a while.

519
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,120
And I want to congratulate Origami Pirate, who's on top of the leaderboard within the

520
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,600
tour right now.

521
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,840
By much.

522
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,380
But yeah, I want to say that with the stats updating as infrequently as they have been,

523
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,800
that might just be a fluke.

524
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,320
But from what I understand, I think that's Spike, who's been on the show before and he's

525
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,840
really good at Guitar Hero, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's dominating the

526
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
OLR leaderboard.

527
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,120
Well, I'm number two, so I'll be moving up.

528
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Oh, working.

529
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,760
Oh, them's fighting words.

530
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Them's fighting words.

531
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
All right.

532
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
That's really all I wanted to say.

533
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Obviously, I plugged in there.

534
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,960
We have a MySpace and all that other stuff, so you should find us and add us.

535
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,240
And of course, we always tape live on Sunday nights and that's in our chat room.

536
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,960
If you missed the live broadcast on Sunday nights, you can always listen to our rebroadcast

537
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,640
on All Games Radio Monday nights after All Games Interactive or Tuesday mornings at 9

538
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,640
a.m. Pacific.

539
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
All right.

540
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Enough plugging.

541
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
News time.

542
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,640
Gaming news.

543
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
All right.

544
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,080
So of course, this week Manhunt 2 came out.

545
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,600
What did I say last week?

546
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,320
Yesterday we'd be talking about Manhunt 2 this week and that's what's going on.

547
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:05,760
And of course, sooner than later, we have a mini hot coffee on our hands and it's basically

548
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,760
the PSP version, the ISO of it out on the internet like any other game out there.

549
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,040
People looked into it and they hacked the distortion that would happen when you would

550
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,240
do your kills.

551
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,220
So now that's hacked out of the way, you now have an uncut version of the game, which is

552
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,000
funny because I actually kind of looked a little bit at this for research purposes and

553
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:39,020
all they have literally is just INI files, like stupid, fully documented INI files.

554
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:45,200
It even says this is where the distortion stuff is for your deaths and you can take

555
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
that out.

556
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,440
So I really went as far as not only just removing the distortion in there, but I made all the

557
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,740
guards blind and deaf, which was fun.

558
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,740
So there's a ton of things.

559
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:02,520
You can edit everything in the game, the weapon damage, you name it.

560
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
It's in there.

561
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,360
Although for some reason when I did make the guys blind and deaf, everything got really,

562
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,520
really bright.

563
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
So I don't know.

564
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,240
Somehow the lighting is attached to that.

565
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,560
Controversy aside, I want to ask first off, is the game good?

566
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,520
Why not?

567
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,680
It's really, plot-wise for the game, there's some sort of a storyline going along.

568
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:29,160
I've only played through the second level, actually the third level, and it's just death

569
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
after death.

570
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,000
It's just all about murdering people.

571
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,480
That really is a big surprise.

572
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,080
There's no big art thing in this.

573
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,560
It's just murdering people.

574
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,640
Granted, this is not art.

575
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
It is an art.

576
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,040
There's probably drugs in there somewhere too.

577
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,980
There is a storyline that goes along with it.

578
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,540
I'm sure when you play through the entire game you figure out why he's killing people,

579
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:56,720
but I mean, you can just shoot somebody and they're dead or know this game where you decide

580
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm going to kill someone with a pen.

581
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,280
I'm going to kill someone with a syringe.

582
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,740
I'm going to kill someone with, you know, a bit of barbed wire and I'm going to saw

583
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,220
their balls off with the barbed wire.

584
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,740
I mean, just a little over the top.

585
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,120
I would think if I'm going to kill someone with barbed wire, sawing their balls off would

586
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,740
be the first thing that would come to my mind.

587
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,480
Yeah, I was a little excessive.

588
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,200
Uno says so it's a murder simulator I know it's not a murder simulator because

589
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,680
you're not really simulating murder you're just simulating a crazy guy that's

590
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,960
running away and happens to be killing people to get away if I was gonna kill

591
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,120
somebody with barbed wire I would do one of two things I would either run it

592
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,040
across their leg on the inside where the artery is or across their neck with a

593
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,880
carotid well that's what they kind of did they ran across her leg there's

594
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,600
three different kills you can do with each weapon one of which for I think for

595
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,920
barbed wire was the big one was running it through their leg the other one was

596
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,440
sawing off their head with it and then there was another one with like

597
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,440
strangling them with it I don't think you could really saw somebody's head

598
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,000
with barbed wire but you could sever the artery there's a video online that you

599
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,440
can actually view all the kills for this thing it I shut it off it was stupid like

600
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,040
I do you have it it was somewhere on the internet it was on some of the big game

601
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,360
blogs I watched part of it and I was like this is stupid you know I reacted

602
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,000
the same way to that video that I did to the movie the saw trilogy or quad quad

603
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,960
trilogy or whatever it is now you know I'll never watch them well soft for is

604
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,960
not art either I'm sorry number one movie at the box office last weekend

605
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,120
that's not art either I'm sorry okay they complain that oh when you know the

606
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,160
ESRB is being too hard on them and stuff like that no I don't think so I mean I

607
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,440
see them with the whole hot coffee thing I think rating that game adult only is

608
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,880
stupid I do agree with that but with manhunt 2 you just watch the

609
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,960
murder you know video that's out there and you're just like okay that's a

610
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,240
little over-the-top I mean yeah even for a game I mean come on it's you know it's

611
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,680
like over-the-top like hostel is I mean as they put it torture porn anyways

612
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,880
Pika Uno also wants to know um because you're talking about all these ways you

613
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,040
can kill people can you kill someone with a boat fire there is fire in this

614
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:11,120
game I know so I don't know maybe in the later stages anyways so anyways so the

615
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,560
ESRB of course made a statement about it they were saying that this is actually

616
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:23,000
it's different than the hot coffee thing because this is a hack versus something

617
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,400
that was unlocked on there which is bullshit anyways because the hot coffee

618
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,240
thing was a hack as well but apparently they're dumb and so well didn't this

619
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,320
time Rockstar disclosed everything that was in the game that was changeable see

620
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,440
yeah I mean they will they I mean they didn't really hide anything I mean

621
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,660
granted it all they did was remove the distortion I guess it's the same as

622
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,800
saying like the Sims where they have patches where you can remove the you

623
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:52,160
know the blur so that you can see sim body parts I mean it's stupid I

624
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,480
personally I do think that the game should have been released on you know

625
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,440
unmodified you know without the distortion on there because to be honest

626
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,520
it's not I mean I don't enjoy it with a source on there because you can't see

627
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,960
what the fuck is going on the whole of that if you go further it's kind of

628
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,840
censorship to me the hilarious part about all this is why did anybody even

629
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,400
run out and buy this game in the first place the controversy why was this game

630
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,520
hacked within 24 hours the controversy if they had like never said that there

631
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,520
were if if word had never come out that there was another version of this game

632
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,120
that had the blurs taken away I bet nobody would have ever thought gee let's

633
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,720
go in there and hack the disk or they certainly would have done it wouldn't

634
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,000
have done it in 20 years another thing that was opening that was a chat that

635
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,760
was issuing a challenge to the hacking okay unity I've to find the original

636
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,960
content in the game and they did it in there they would in the past I've

637
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,520
actually you know been curious and looked at different ISO's this has been

638
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:53,120
the easiest mom to modify ISO I have ever seen it is seriously fully

639
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,800
documented I mean there is it does not take a genius to fix this stuff you see

640
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,920
the part where it's you know for blurring it out you remove it done I

641
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,040
mean oh that's really tough I mean seriously it's stupid if they really

642
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,720
think they kept it easy because they had to fix it so fast to get the game out on

643
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,080
how they did have to fix the game and I understand that but no they could have

644
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,200
easily encrypted that stuff it could have been in a file it's not just a

645
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,680
plain text file it could have been encrypted it could have been something

646
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,400
that people couldn't find you know make it a little bit harder for them but I

647
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,000
don't know it's just it's really stupid Tiger Claw says keep in mind they only

648
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,920
hacked the PSP version an average person so far figure out how to do so far and

649
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,400
I'm going to tell you this much the PlayStation 2 version is gonna be hacked

650
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,640
before you know it because they put this way the INI files that were documented

651
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,680
in there it was for both PlayStation 2 and PSP so it's only a matter of time

652
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:52,960
this whole controversy is just waving a red cape at the hacking community oh lay

653
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,400
oh lay you know you've got about it if you've got a modded console this is

654
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:02,800
gonna be hacked pretty soon I mean no doubt about it because I'm looking at

655
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,280
just what they have in there that seriously the INI files that were in

656
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,120
there are documented for both PSP and PlayStation 2 I'm sure the Wii version

657
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,360
is also the same as well but those two were mentioned in that file so I don't

658
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,440
see why it wouldn't be the same it's just stupid and I think they did it on

659
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,360
purpose Tiger Claw says I think the only way you can hack the ps2 version if they

660
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,080
did it via the pro-action replay um no I think you can actually mod I mean

661
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,800
because there's people out there that make custom guitar hero games you know

662
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,840
for the PlayStation 2 if you have a modded console you can create custom ISO

663
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,080
for that stuff you know what this reminds me this whole thing reminds me

664
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,600
of remember when Nintendo made that controversial move to change the blood

665
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,960
in Mortal Kombat 2 to sweat and it was like suddenly it became this challenge

666
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,040
all over the like who can find the game genie code first that will change the

667
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,160
sweat to red to bring back the blood into Mortal Kombat 2 it became a contest

668
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,040
it was the red tape at the community going put me back the way I was supposed

669
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,200
to be because we all know this game was fixed you know but here's the thing

670
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,240
though I think even removing you know the distortion in or whatever it really

671
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,800
doesn't change anything in the game I mean yeah it's violent and stuff but to

672
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,840
be honest just like hostile hostile wasn't a good movie it was just a

673
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,080
violent movie it's just like this game it's not a good game just as a violent

674
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,000
game and it's just changing cutscenes and not actual gameplay I'm just kind of

675
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
pissed off at Rockstar for I don't know what the fuck they're doing they're

676
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,360
trying to like ruin everything by making games overly violent so that people come

677
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,840
down on them harder and they're like why do people keep coming after us it's

678
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,800
unfair well be maybe you should stop you know I don't know having people with

679
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,320
limbs being blown off and stuff like that in very graphic manners how about

680
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,080
that maybe that's a start all right well I'm sure most of our listeners have been

681
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,800
following on the internet and been reading about the manhunt controversy

682
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm sure a lot of you have your own opinions if you'd like to send them in

683
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,560
you can always send us an email mailbag at orange laundry calm so moving on I

684
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,320
just want to say really quick there's rumors going around the target is

685
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,720
actually going to be pulling manhunt 2 from the stores because of this but I've

686
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,800
lead this has been going a little bit back and forth that it's a rumor no it's

687
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,240
not on it basically it started with a website PSP update that wrote this

688
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,800
report reports would come in the target is pulling manhunt 2 a member of the

689
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,840
evil avatar forums dr. finger hey evil avatars another show on all games woot

690
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,320
for them getting publicity said that he got news of an internal memo spreading

691
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,120
within the company which states that every branch will stop selling the game

692
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,200
and to refuse all future delivery of the title for the system however manhunt 2

693
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,280
is available apparently on targets website it's available online but not

694
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:49,920
available in stores so there you have it I think maybe I wonder if that's just a

695
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,680
demand thing though because I mean I when I think of big video game retailers

696
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,140
I don't always think a target target has a very limited selection of games they

697
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,280
carry what's kind of current and popular and honestly controversy aside I don't

698
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,360
think this game is gonna sell very well and I think they kind of know that they

699
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,640
would rather be stocking games that are gonna sell more I think it'll sell well

700
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:16,880
it's cheap it's like $39.99 for the we $29.99 for ps2 and PSP so all right

701
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,240
well there are other people mad about manhunt and for a different reason in

702
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,400
the manual for manhunt they didn't mention one of the major parties that

703
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,560
worked on the game being a Vienna yeah let's sort of forget you know people who

704
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,160
worked on the game here so they that's kind of messed up well yeah well their

705
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,240
studio is closed down but they still should have been as rockstar Vienna they

706
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,680
they still should have been credited for all the work that they did they said it

707
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,520
was over 50 people working for two years on the game so like it's almost like

708
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,640
rockstar Vienna got shut down and then all traces of it were erased in history

709
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,520
apparently they didn't get credited in this game but I'd be good for them

710
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,720
anyways but at the same time do you really want your name on this game I

711
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,360
think really I mean I agree completely that people should get credit for the

712
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,880
workday they do but I would be using an alias here's my thing I think they

713
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,460
should have made manhunt to just make it seriously I mean go all out put a PC

714
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,320
version out there and just fucking go nuts I mean do what you would do in man

715
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,760
hunt 2 and times 10 I mean seriously just crazy over-the-top that's what I'd

716
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,300
like to see darkside darkside says that's not cool you got to give people

717
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,560
credit for their work if I worked over two years on the game come on sky no I

718
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,540
agree people should get credit for the work they do but I'm just saying you

719
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,760
know if I worked on manhunt 2 I don't know like if I worked on orange box I'd

720
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,040
be all about one that piece that credit but you know manhunt 2 I don't know

721
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,280
about that all right anyways in other news and this is actually a little bit

722
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,320
of an opposite Sony actually has a brand new advertising campaign coming off the

723
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,300
PlayStation 3 that oh my god does actually not suck this campaign of

724
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,960
course a little bit different than the last year's campaign which is known as

725
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:29,680
the white room and according to Peter Dill of you know the PSN Network and

726
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,600
also the senior vice president of marketing apparently he's a last year we

727
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,480
launched a ps3 campaign that became known as the white room and received a

728
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,720
strong reaction to those ads for being provocative and demonstrating the ps3

729
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:57,480
power nope anyways man in our chat says the white room racists anyways let's see

730
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,320
with those technology technology messages now firmly embedded we wanted

731
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,280
to move beyond the power message with a more high energy entertaining driven

732
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,280
focus for the ps3 the games here the price point is now $3.99 and we want to

733
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:22,520
make the news loud and clear I don't get how he says they received a strong

734
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,440
reaction for being provocative no they didn't make any sense they didn't make

735
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,840
any sense I didn't understand why the PlayStation 3 is making a baby cry I

736
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,720
didn't understand why it was powerful why it was making you know it baseballs

737
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,760
explode or whatever it made no fucking sense and now you actually have an

738
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,080
advertising campaign or a series of commercials that actually show gameplay

739
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,600
get people excited about the games and stuff like that that's what you should

740
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,120
have done from the beginning instead of who I mean seriously all three consoles

741
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,840
are the same thing they did these really weird-ass commercials that made no sense

742
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,000
like with Xbox the whole jump in shit that makes no sense and they have one

743
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,120
going on right now which they have like a little kid like singing a song and

744
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,040
stuff and then they show Mass Effect Halo 3 and like oh god I remember Oh

745
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,480
Bioshock all M rated games you know and there's like yeah Xbox but anyways it's

746
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,840
just like so stupid but seriously I'm glad that they finally have a good

747
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,240
marketing campaign don't seriously next time you're launching a console you know

748
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,080
don't get all fucking crazy and hire this marketing team to come up with

749
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,920
these stupid ideas like you know baby crying so it makes no fucking sense

750
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,280
people get creeped out by that shit well I gotta buy your console well the new

751
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,320
commercial one of the new commercials I saw it earlier today it had like

752
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:44,880
tentacles and disembodied mouths coming out of the system it's cool that's cool

753
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,000
that's what people want disembodied mouths and tentacles and tentacles I

754
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,480
think if I were marketing the PlayStation 3 right now my marketing

755
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,960
campaign would go along the lines of something like this is there would be

756
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,000
like let's imagine it was a radio commercial for the PlayStation 3 here it

757
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:07,280
is please buy one I'll do anything they say I have MotorStorm and I played

758
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,320
blu-ray is please they say that they have games out there but I don't know

759
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:21,960
about that I have home in 2008 some final fantasy 13 sometime in the future

760
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,440
why won't you buy it they are showing Grinch for their log though even though

761
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,400
that's not available over here yet at all and to be fair that's not really

762
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,400
even a game yet or another PlayStation 3 commercial could be buy a PlayStation 3

763
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,160
and fold proteins all day long well they did show that it plays blu-ray and stuff

764
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,320
they have that and I here we go the PlayStation 3 is helping to cure cancer

765
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,720
if you don't buy a PlayStation 3 that means you support cancer that's what it

766
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,200
is I am all for cancer yay cancer anyhow that's a very tasteless a little side

767
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,400
tangent there let's talk about things that should probably be omitted from the

768
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,120
campaign because it caused one particular company stocks to drop a

769
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,000
little bit this week and that was the news that Metal Gear Solid 4 has gotten

770
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,280
another little little push got a little push back Oh surprise remember how

771
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,360
Metal Gear Solid 4 was gonna come out first quarter of 2008

772
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,440
well scratch that make it second quarter 2008 the day this news was announced by

773
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,960
the way Konami stocks went down a little bit because this was you know the game

774
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,280
that's supposed to be really giving a kick in the pants to the PlayStation 3

775
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,000
so one of the few exclusives they have left sort of there you have it Metal

776
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,260
Gear Solid 4 delayed until 2008 the two quarter to 2008 the official reason by

777
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,160
the way quote further improvements to the quality of the game and provide even

778
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,060
greater enjoyment for more customers worldwide don't get me wrong if this is

779
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,840
what they need to do to ensure the game is going to be an a plus plus and not

780
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,360
suck I'm all for it it just you know sucks for Sony right at least it's not

781
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,920
being you know powered by the Unreal 3 engine so we know it's not because of

782
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,740
that yeah so I don't care about the delay if it's gonna make the game

783
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,280
awesome as far as I'm aware there's no flying dragons in this game so I know

784
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,760
it's not anything like that well I think that you know with any game they need to

785
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,600
keep pushing things back if they don't have them done rather than released a

786
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:32,720
you know a buggy unfinished crappy product what game do we remember that

787
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,840
did that doesn't matter though it's like yes it's seriously gonna be like Twilight

788
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,440
Princess it doesn't matter it'll get 10 when it's released because people have a

789
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:46,360
fucking hard-on for that game hmm well there is actually something that might

790
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:52,000
make people happy it is still hanging out in rumor land but there there's

791
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,960
speculation that there's going to be a new PlayStation 2 in 2008 for $99 so it

792
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:07,800
actually is a reported by an NCV that it would be introduced in UK in the UK at

793
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:16,760
75 pounds or lower so I don't know because Sony hasn't you know no given any

794
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,880
official word on it I wouldn't be surprised if they can save you know 30

795
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,920
bucks or whatever by removing the chip to play PlayStation 1 games on that I

796
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,320
wouldn't be surprised whatsoever in fact actually it would make perfect sense if

797
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,800
they did that because you know to be honest no one really plays PlayStation

798
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,280
1 games anymore so if they remove the backwards compatibility for PlayStation

799
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,520
1 games in this ps2 I don't think anyone would care oh whatever and if you're

800
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,760
buying and you know Final Fantasy 7 for life I busted out jumping flash like

801
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,120
about a month ago if you wanna play jumping flash you can buy yourself a

802
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,280
PlayStation 3 and download that shit or buy a PSP I shouldn't have to pay for it

803
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,040
again why should I cuz I actually own the game well then you should have bought

804
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,680
a PlayStation 2 seven years ago I have a PlayStation 2 well then this doesn't

805
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,920
affect you I'm just saying any once more anybody that's still playing PlayStation

806
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,640
1 right now I mean there's still people who like to break out their classic

807
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,120
games good then I hope you have a PlayStation 1 but they're not gonna be

808
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,800
buying new PlayStation 1 games I mean whereas the PlayStation 3 not playing

809
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,460
PlayStation 2 games that's stupid because they're still putting out new

810
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:31,040
PlayStation 2 games but I think it's safe to remove the you know PlayStation

811
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,720
1 backwards compatibility in this if you know that's what they're going to do

812
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,840
dark text says Loki no don't give them ideas act deaf degrees the jumping flash

813
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:48,480
is awesome jumping flash is freaking rad you know that's what they need to do

814
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,080
that will completely revive the PlayStation 3 is a new jumping flash oh

815
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:59,160
yeah that'll be it gee only a new jumping flash should come out then I

816
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,360
would have something to play on this damn thing how about Bubsy 3d part 2 how

817
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:11,960
about not how about clay fighters I'm telling you how long ago do we say this

818
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,560
I miss playing Hilda six months ago when these you know console wars were heating

819
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,760
up and stuff we said the first console that gets laser cats the game will win

820
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,800
the next-gen Wars and you we have yet to see laser cats the game so it's anybody's

821
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,760
guess well there's technically I mean we're coming out on Dreamcast hostel

822
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,760
three's got that one gun that's a bat you know guys hand up a badger's ass so

823
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,520
that's kind of close I mean not really it's not a cat with a freaking laser on

824
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,640
its head we don't know that they don't have laser cats in that I mean next

825
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,600
story please another game that's been delayed a little bit and now is finally

826
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,320
officially coming out on a little PC at least unreal tournament 3 it's been

827
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:01,520
announced on PC for November 19th the PlayStation 3 versions coming soon

828
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:09,520
probably 2008 but it's soon I love that they're given the same old excuse my mom

829
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,960
gave when I asked mom when's dinner it'll be here when it's done that's

830
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,320
exactly what they're saying about unreal you will have it when it's done now sit

831
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,080
down and shut up and watch TV it really does suck though unreal tournament 3

832
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,160
isn't coming out this year I mean cuz I thought that would be the big game for

833
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,200
them to kind of get people to buy some consoles guess you'll be buying PCs

834
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,400
instead go PCs all I know is unreal tournament you know the older games were

835
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,520
fast so if you like your get you you feel like your shooters nauseatingly

836
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,560
fast and reels the place to go but I want to see all the mods for this that's

837
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,360
really what I'm interested in that will be kind of cool something that's kind of

838
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,880
cool for PlayStation 3 owners if you've especially if you've held out purchasing

839
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,400
Eternal Sonata on the Xbox 360 it has been confirmed that on the PlayStation

840
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,660
3 version of the game which was should be out next year at some point some new

841
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,240
characters will be added into the game they were in the story on the Xbox 360

842
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,760
version but they weren't playable and those are the characters Serenade and

843
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,800
Prince Crescendo cuz the big joke in Eternal Sonata is that every single damn

844
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,160
thing in the game is named after something in the music world which is

845
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,160
actually kind of cute by the way the PlayStation 3 version not only will have

846
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,200
the characters but it will have extra story sequences so of course the 360

847
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,800
fans are like you know especially me you know I bought the game on 360 and I

848
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:36,320
don't even own a PlayStation 3 as of yet I'm kind of going can it be download

849
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:42,600
content time please please can I have it but we'll see so Eternal Sonata on the

850
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:48,360
PlayStation 3 with extra crap next year yay I still should play that but I

851
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:54,680
haven't had time well this makes me relatively happy although it's a more of

852
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:03,040
a you know cuz yeah hi I'm tongue-tied this is really I think great news is

853
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,280
that the Final Fantasy 1 & 2 on PSP are coming out in the UK they're doing a pal

854
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,040
conversion so it'll be out in early 2008 and I think it was really really good

855
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,920
because it's the second one especially is such a good game but although the

856
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,880
third of those was my favorite the third and fifth were Mike my favorites but

857
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,560
anyway um we've had this for a while and they're really good the remakes have

858
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,360
just been very sharp the coloring and the graphics very sharp it's I actually

859
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,440
bought because you know I bought willing the PSP for his birthday and I bought

860
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:43,040
him a copy of Final Fantasy 1 so because he's a big fan of Final Fantasy so well

861
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,560
what I was saying is that you know they're basically taking the old you

862
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,000
know Nintendo versions and you know they're retooled with widescreen new

863
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,360
dungeons redrawn artwork just the works and I'm really glad that it's coming out

864
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:04,840
over there finally yeah it's gonna be really good and there was much

865
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,680
rejoicing overseas all right back at home it's time to travel around and in

866
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,580
the world and look at some early states yay really states anyways this week

867
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:22,080
marks the first of many very packed weeks with plenty of things coming out

868
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,800
this week though there are some stupid things coming out including Aqua teen

869
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,720
hunger for zombie ninja pro-am on PlayStation 2 if you can't get enough of

870
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:38,560
Aqua teen hunger for us there you go let's see here brats for real on the DS

871
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:44,840
awesome build a bear workshop as opposed to brats for fake well it's based most

872
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,280
of the things you see on the brats are probably fake actually build a bear

873
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,720
workshop where you can create your own it's a teddy bear sim to be honest this

874
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,600
game's 30 bucks you could probably buy a real teddy bear for a lot cheaper so

875
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,880
that's kind of stupid I think building the bear in the workshop and the actual

876
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:05,160
store cost less than that and probably I don't know that shit's expensive the

877
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,360
more bling you want to buy for your bear that shit gets expensive Call of Duty 4

too much brawn panty master but you know I can they can lose the brawn panty and

989
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,280
I'll be fine but you know we know we just need you know what game they need

990
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,920
to make if they're gonna do wrestling games and you know I like the WWE ones

991
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,080
because I like the customizing mode is I fully you know we just pick random

992
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:48,800
people and just make them but they need a luchador game nothing but luchadors

993
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:54,520
you know you make your mask and you know have all these high-flying moves

994
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:03,840
and everything and the whole game is in Spanish that's what we need you know

995
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,360
what they need to make a video game out of speaking of Spanish television what

996
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:11,280
I tell you what you know what the fucking greatest show is on Telemundo

997
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:19,080
Sabado Higante Sabado Higante is like this big clusterfuck of a game show

998
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,040
meets a talk show meets it's like it's like all of everything that is and then

999
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,280
there's like a telenovelas in it too it's like all of what is great on TV

1000
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,800
compressed into like one three-hour show have you ever seen the mad TV sketch

1001
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:37,700
where it's like this Asian guide it's like it's like many show with two guys

1002
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,560
or something like that but it's like different shows they change like the

1003
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:45,840
theme of it it's like cooking show drama show you know you know what else game

1004
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,160
that they need and this is inspired after watching Human Tetris last night

1005
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:55,880
hmm they need Japanese TV show the game sorry act-def act-def is reminding me

1006
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:04,520
that Sabado Higante is on Univision and not Telemundo sorry but have you ever

1007
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:09,520
watched have you ever watched any Japanese game shows or some of the live

1008
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:15,440
variety shows I saw like a freaking bizarre YouTube freaking bizarre they

1009
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,440
need to do a game that's like that or like Takeshi's Castle the game that I

1010
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,800
would buy that more news please because seriously now this show is getting into

1011
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:31,040
let's see we've talked about Sabado Higante bra and panty matches and now

1012
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:35,960
we're just talking about release dates so we need to get back into it news

1013
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:43,680
anyways so this week as we mentioned you know of course you're starting to see

1014
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,040
those rock band demo kits come to Best Buy as well some Best Buy is because

1015
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:51,960
some retarded Best Buy employees are starting to sell the demo kits like the

1016
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,000
actual game thinking hey we only got one of these let's put it out and sell it

1017
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,680
and then some idiot buys it and then it ends up on eBay but then it's all over

1018
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:09,200
the internet haha I gots the rock band first first ease so anyways cool I have

1019
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,320
the biggest penis on the whole internet cuz I have rock band before you yes

1020
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,800
apparently people are selling the demo kits and people are actually buying them

1021
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:25,480
the demo kit actually the drums kit is missing the kick drum so oops the also

1022
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,040
of course it's a demo version of the game so doesn't have all the songs and

1023
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:35,000
what's really funny if you want it it's been relisted on eBay because

1024
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,240
originally they pulled it down oh and they pull it down again but last I

1025
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,640
checked it if the bidding was up to seven hundred and seventy dollars look

1026
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,520
why would you pay six hundred dollars more for a game that's like gonna be out

1027
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,040
in a few weeks anyways and it's not even the full game I'm like you're an idiot

1028
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,920
sometimes I wonder if I'm even really in the same human race as all these other

1029
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:00,360
people I mean it's but yeah you out of the gene pool what this particular case

1030
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:06,120
it was the marina California Best Buy that they sold it to somebody for it

1031
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,120
rang up as a hundred and eighty dollars I think that you're an idiot if you bought

1032
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,840
it for a hundred eighty dollars and you deserve what you get but you know maybe

1033
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,000
you do want to pick up one of these demo kits because apparently they're gonna be

1034
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,600
hard to find come holiday according to EA president John around there John

1035
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,720
anyways I'm not gonna try to pronounce his last name he's predicting that rock

1036
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:35,000
band bundles may be tough to come by for a while we won't be able to put enough

1037
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,840
inventory to meet the demand this fiscal or calendar year looks like a Ricky

1038
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:46,360
tillio Ricky tillio I'm gonna go with that told investors adding that those

1039
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,480
who don't buy at launch won't be getting one for Christmas unless you know someone

1040
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:56,600
at one of our retailers what John forgot to mention to people is that that why do

1041
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,160
you suppose that they're hard to find is it because the game is so immensely

1042
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,240
pause you know popular that people are gonna be buying it like crazy it could

1043
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,000
be or it could be they didn't make enough or it could be that they saw what

1044
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,520
happened with the Wii last year and they're like we got to do that no you

1045
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,720
see here here's a little funny thing about this EA has never made a music

1046
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:23,800
game before and they've never made music game controllers before and so they're

1047
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,960
having a little trouble making the music game controllers and guess what there's

1048
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,480
a lot of shortages because of that and because you pre-ordered one doesn't

1049
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,080
necessarily mean that you're gonna be getting one either think the Wii again

1050
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:41,440
think guitar hero 3 yes same thing with that thanks a lot John if there's ever a

1051
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:47,360
music game coming out there requires a guitar a drum a ukulele whatever the

1052
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:53,080
fuck it will be our that's a tar yes the tar hero is redo here will be very

1053
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:58,160
fucking hard to find because for some reason people have trouble making fake

1054
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:06,880
guitars so if you have one pre-ordered awesome if you don't you're fucked you

1055
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,400
better wait just take a broom and stick some old arcade buttons on it there you

1056
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,720
go it's a guitar I will be getting one of these only because I have to lie

1057
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:21,520
cheat and steal things well if you don't want to wait around or if you don't if

1058
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,120
you aren't lucky enough to get your hands on a copy of rock band you could

1059
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,240
always wait for harmonics is neck harmonics is next game I need to take

1060
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,240
lessons in reading but the thing is harmonics will not be putting guitars

1061
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:39,320
in their next game also be easy to find okay I mean obviously been there done

1062
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,760
that guitar hero and now they have rock band and don't forget harmonics you know

1063
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,720
started with frequency amplitude karaoke revolution these games do not have

1064
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:54,400
guitars so their next game will not have guitars they will be revealing some

1065
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,480
secrets about the game at next year's game developers conference I don't hop

1066
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,880
hero this is what I know they're gonna rip off DER now awesome no I'm on it no

1067
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,320
this is what they said quote beats would not be authored by tech savvy musicians

1068
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:11,160
but would instead be algorithmically generated oh awesome

1069
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,840
Dance Factory 2 there won't be a dedicated peripheral for the game

1070
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:22,280
awesome amplitude million hey I would not mind a sequel to the frequency

1071
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,640
amplitude you know I would be let's finish off that trilogy with a real

1072
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,520
awesome game now that they have the heart you know they leave Lee has tracks

1073
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,440

1078
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,520
if I had known that sucker and here we are doing the show you know you know

1079
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,000
what I have is my alarm on my phone what's that science genius girl or

1080
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,680

1081

1082
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,520
love to hear that cool news

1083
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,840
I'm ready to um no it's like a radar I see the one let's talk more rock thank

1084
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:30,680
you yeah that's my actual ringtone right now nice so anyway oh that was my Python

1085
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:38,200
it was so worth the wait yeah anyway I love my iPhone I'm sorry so for anyone

1086
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:42,880
who is interested in the downloadable content for guitar hero 3 there has been

1087
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:55,960
a leak we which we hope is a real leak there is stuff listed as let me see if I

1088
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:00,680
can this thing is kind of hard for me to read because it's all it's a picture

1089
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:08,600
taken off of a television but there were boss battle tracks listed where you know

1090
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,800
the ones you could pick and choose so it's pretty interesting that would be

1091
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,080
great because you can't practice those in the game in practice mode and it's

1092
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,160
pissing me off this is a lot of battles are hard there's the slash guitar battle

1093
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:24,960
devil went down to Georgia putting holes and happiness the pretender this is a

1094
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,120
call it's all on there so those are unlocked from the soundtrack if I

1095
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,280
remember right like the putting holes in happiness yeah well and I almost bought

1096
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:39,520
the the soundtrack just to you know see if you know how all that worked out but

1097
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:47,440
of course I'm cheap and said it's okay sorry so but well basically that is

1098
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,320
actually paid unlock content because that stuff is unlocked with the code so

1099
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,200
the with just in the regards to like the putting holes in happiness I know it's

1100
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:00,560
not really know that you get codes to down through it so I go get codes to

1101
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,800
download the content off I stand corrected my bad next story please

1102
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:15,080

1103
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:20,880
out he's getting some awesome download content actually three pieces of awesome

1104
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,560
download content one of course is free enable and it actually allows you to

1105
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:32,360
play a multiplayer split-screen co-op game which is kind of cool so to

1106
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:37,880
overlords right around 50 minions each killing innocent people and then of

1107
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:43,320
course two of the other packs will cost you some points no things have been

1108
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,640
announced yet one will offer five new levels for the single-player campaign

1109
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:52,800
the other will allow legendary a legendary difficulty and from right here

1110
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:58,480
the five levels are in hell so that's kind of neat that's good that's smart of

1111
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,480
developers to do because their game kind of did get you know stumped by you know

1112
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,240
the Bioshock and the OMG halo 3 and all that so this is a good way to remind

1113
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,800
people hey you might have forgotten about me but you should be looking at me

1114
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,240
that's a good game that's fun I told you I'm I have a frickin copy of the game

1115
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,720
and I still haven't had just play it cuz I've just been so distracted with

1116
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,800
everything else don't point and make evil eyes at me don't give me evils

1117
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,080
because I could be selling that game for don't give me evils I'm playing yes or

1118
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,920
place you didn't regain because the only two consoles I don't have hacked yet

1119
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,600
well last week on this program I believe Loki reported that IPTV was going to be

1120
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,400
a part of the new fall update hey it was a theory okay theory is setting him up

1121
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,980
that theory was nuked this week as Microsoft said oh shit we better make a

1122
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:45,240
statement on this and Microsoft came out and said quote internet protocol

1123
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,280
television IPTV features will only be available from the Xbox 360 through a

1124
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,120
service provider who has deployed Xbox 360 with Microsoft media room services

1125
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,720
this is an isolated incident where these features were inadvertently exposed

1126
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,400
while the customers console was being serviced and is unrelated to the fall

1127
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,880
update of course they didn't say how the fuck did that happen I mean seriously

1128
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:12,120
where did that 360 go to get fixed it went to the future apparently but it is

1129
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,080
I believe they did announce that it was supposed to be out before the end of

1130
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:24,000
this year dates in the TARDIS where is the fall update in the fall no it's in

1131
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,040
the news now fall check now I believe it's in the next few weeks next couple

1132
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,800
weeks should be what I think last year is around the 12th or something like

1133
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,680
that I wonder what kind of cool shiz we're gonna see in the update since

1134
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:40,080
we're not seeing IPTV I know what stuff oh yeah I love stuff hey I got some

1135
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:49,080
stuff yeah yeah got a salad no you ate it it has an anime an anime yes what's

1136
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:58,400
that so for people who are fans of Blue Dragon we get an anime release of course

1137
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,360
if Toriyama isn't you know involved in it you know there's gonna be an anime

1138
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,440
involved which is why I wonder why we never got Chrono Trigger but that's

1139
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,320
another story so um yeah Blue Dragon is going to have episodes coming to Xbox

1140
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:15,460
Live for free November 15th through January 1st the episodes will all be

01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:22,200

01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,520
edition that's going to be coming out for a 2940 yen which is 26 bucks here in

1175
01:16:53,760 --> 01:17:05,880
seriously anyways so other fun stuff pirates vs. ninjas dodgeball such an

1176
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,680
awesome name for a game I guess it's been confirmed to be coming to Xbox live

1177
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:15,880
arcade however they haven't really nailed down an exact time frame but

1178
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:21,480
early 2008 as once expected and you will truly be able to see who is better

1179
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:30,680
pirates or ninjas in the ancient art of dodgeball or zombies or zombies we're

1180
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:38,400
ignoring a very important class of you know so of you know hinges no cowboys

1181
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:44,640
fuck cowboys ain't got nothing they're never fans yes this is cowboys horse

1182
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:50,960
riding losers we never saw movies about gay ninjas or gay pirates not counting

1183
01:17:50,960 --> 01:18:04,400
down that wasn't gay that was just you know Keith Richards anyways alrighty

1184
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,880
well I'm looking forward to seeing the ultimate pirate vs. ninja showdown I mean

1185
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,480
honestly I think this is a brilliant idea for a video game pirates vs.

1186
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,720
ninjas somebody's finally doing it what do you lame

1187
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:21,640
pirates vs. ninjas come on oh yeah that's awesome you know the instead of

1188
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:28,680
having a really cool fighting and they go play dodgeball yeah frickin dodge

1189
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:33,040
shut that thing up frickin of Jamie showing off her YouTube edge on her

1190
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:39,560
phone um now I lost my train of thought god damn you oh I was gonna say pirates

1191
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:44,120
vs. ninjas oh the dodgeball game that they had on the NES back in the day I

1192
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,880
came was awesome well you can get it on a DS member the

1193
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,360
remake that was awesome pirates and ninjas in that game how

1194
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,960
awesome is that let's see Tiger Claw says oh I don't know having cowboys

1195
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,760
would give the pirates and ninjas an unfair advantage cowboys use guns so do

1196
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:07,960
pirates and they have fucking zords yeah they have ninjas started I think that I

1197
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:13,680
think that honestly I think that the two enemy classes should be ninja and

1198
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:19,760
cowboy and you have the pirate who's the hybrid on top of that they can swim if

1199
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:27,560
they're good pirate lastly in this segment before we get to the classic

1200
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,640
game of the week the engage I know you've all been excited about you know

1201
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,160
you remember the engage of course was the taco phone and now the engage went

1202
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:39,200
away because it was going to be a new service it's a basically standardized

1203
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:43,600
platform for mobile services the engage gaming platform and I know you kids

1204
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,360
have just been waiting eagerly for the engage platform to get out there however

1205
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,600
Nokia is delayed it there's been problems with software development and

1206
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:57,200
it's now pushed back a few weeks there are you developing for the engage what

1207
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:04,440
apparently EA Capcom and Vivendi are all stepping up to develop for the engage so

1208
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:12,280
there you have it the engage service is coming soon anyhow coming to you right

1209
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:18,360
now is the classic video game of the week every week Dark Sakura picks out a

1210
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,480
game from the archives of history that maybe I didn't know about before and

1211
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:30,520
says damn it you should be playing this game so Dark Sakura please reveal for us

1212
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:36,360
like you said Dark Sakura is that the game Dark Sakura that'd be cool if there

1213
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:40,840
was a game called Dark Sakura Dark Sakura picks Dark Sakura I picked a game

1214
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:44,880
and that it's not really I wouldn't say obscure but it didn't come out in the

1215
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,200
US however we've had characters from this game show up in other games and I've

1216
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,320
mentioned it before we have cyber BOTS full metal madness which is freaking

1217
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:59,000
awesome very cool I'm getting some sound here from cyber BOTS tell the kids about

1218
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,120
cyber BOTS while I get the sound here the cyber BOTS is a fighting game that

1219
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:10,960
uses a mecha and you can choose a different classes of mecha and then each

1220
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,360
of them have three different ones that are in that class that have different

1221
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:21,560
types of weaponry so it's fairly customizable how you play it and it had

1222
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:27,560
these little you know cinema cutscenes and a cool storyline but this game also

1223
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:35,080
is what brought us the character Jin Soutome who was in Marvel vs. Capcom and

1224
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:41,440
his robot Blodia so his attack was clearly from the game certain times of

1225
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:48,160
the month my wife built Blodia okay whatever anyway and this game also

1226
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:59,600
brought gave us devilot from a puzzle fighter and her she has the best robot

1227
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:09,080
an entire game the super 8 which is a big octopus robot so this game also had

1228
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:15,120
one of the best hidden characters was mecha goki which is basically goki was

1229
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:20,680
a kuma over here from Street Fighter series they have a goki robot that has

1230
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:26,920
all of those attacks everything was pretty awesome but also there was a you

1231
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,320
know for anyone now who goes back and plays puzzle fighter in here to see

1232
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:35,120
devilot's code you know never heard of it still to know cyber BOTS is Capcom's

1233
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,360
number one game that's what it is I've actually got a special edition that came

1234
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:43,880
with like a book in this big box and it was really cool on on Saturn and you can

1235
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,560
actually still find the game for fairly reasonable but it's to me it's actually

1236
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,000
I think one of Capcom's best games you know as far as how they're fighting is

1237
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,680
going I think was a damn shame that you know we only got a very limited arcade

1238
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:03,440
release over here it never got the home version yes all right well there you

1239
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,920
have it boys and girls your classic game of the week

1240
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:15,720
cyber BOTS I like any titles on again Saturn Saturn oh but it was arcade and

1241
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:21,040
Saturn more Sega love from Dark Sakura well the Sega Saturn was like one of the

1242
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,320
best systems there was a lot of overlooked games did fine sort of

1243
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,080
related to Sega hmm there's many ITX computers that people are building

1244
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:34,480
someone built one out of a Sega CD and a Genesis I was looking on the side it was

1245
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:41,080
really cool minus collecting dust by the way all right well that's going to bring

1246
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:45,280
