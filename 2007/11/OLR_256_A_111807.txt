Tonight, November 18th, 2007, Xbox 360 is getting its own virtual console of sorts, DivX is coming to PlayStation 3, and is the Nintendo DS redesigned on its way next year?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Joining me as always, the co-host that make this shiz happen, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Rob gave me chocolate that has booze in it.
I hate to say it, but they didn't card me for it, so the alcohol is presumably cooked out.
I'm pretty sure of it, but I still think that it's very, very tasty.
I've had some that has lots of alcohol in it, though.
That's cool.
I want that.
The ones that had the Grand Marnier in it, and they also had Johnny Walker.
I have not heard of this.
I'll have to find out where Julie got them from, but they do card you for those.
I think you should do that now.
Maybe you can get them at BevMo.
I bet you could.
All right.
Say hello as well to the one and only Loki.
Hello.
How are you doing, Loki?
I'm okay other than a headache.
Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear you have a headache.
Do you need some Tylenol?
No, I already took some.
Profen?
Hammer?
I already took stuff.
All right.
By the way, for the lovely folks watching our webcam feed on Operator 11, you can see Loki's shirt.
Didn't you get this at Fonamay?
Yeah, I got this at Fonamay.
Grand Theft Amish, Penn State, Dutch.
Yes.
Lovely.
Very nice shirt.
DarkSakura.com
and DarkSakura.
Dan came too, and we played a bunch of ticket games at that John's Not Very Amazing Pizza It's John's Incredible Pizza, but we now call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza I can't see the name of it, but it's the new Afterburner that came out like, what, a year ago?
It looked pretty rad, I didn't even know it was there Oh, it's really, really cool, and we played like a bunch of that And I went on this Twister thing Oh my god, William was so funny
and a big hello to the person that worked there, Chris, who stopped us and was like, you're the guys from Original Radio, huh?
And that was kind of cool.
I was like, I need to write this thing first.
Ego++.
What?
Level up.
Yeah, we got recognized from the show by some guy who worked there.
It was pretty awesome.
So he recognized me because DarkSakura was on the ride and then I was like, oh, you gotta go meet Jamie's mom.
Well, she's never on camera anyways.
That's true.
You're not on Op 11, so they don't know what you look like.
But she's in the album art, so I'm sure if
If they've done their homework, they know.
And she's on the All Games page.
There's a picture and all that stuff.
And I've got pictures of me on my MySpace.
Yeah, that's right.
Because I take them with my own camera of myself.
Sadly, I was not able to get free things from the ticket counter.
Because William wanted one of those, it was something really fruity, like a princess backpack or something stupid just to make me buy it for him.
I don't think it was so much that he probably wanted it, but he wanted me to buy it for him.
I wanted the Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
Those were cool.
I wanted the little mini pinball game, because I'm not cool like Jamie, and I have like 20 pinball machines in my house.
Oh, yeah, we traded out one of our pinballs.
We're actually holding some pinball machines for a friend.
And so we got rid of Time Machine, which made me sad, but we have a Black Knight now.
Oh, rad.
Not Black Knight 2000, but the old Black Knight.
That's so cool.
Which is still a cool table.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, sorry, go ahead.
Go ahead.
I'm posting a link in the chat room right now, which apparently I noticed my t-shirt had a web URL on it.
So this is where you can find it.
I had to go through a few links.
But this guy has some other wonderful shirts, including one that's a spoof of the Clerks shirt, or I guess box art from the movie, Clerics.
It says, just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.
I played a lot more Ragnarok of course
I had a really nice game of World Cup Soccer, 94, which was a very, very good game.
I actually watched the entire playthrough of Portal just because I watched it twice.
Did the cake ever come true?
No.
Sorry to hear it.
But
I also, after the show when I got home last week, because I had a three day weekend, because I work for a bank, I was really bored and had bad insomnia, so I completely redid my live journal, and I now have a portal theme.
with a companion cube on it.
With a big old weighted companion cube on it.
I did watch the YouTube of the poor companion.
It was like a companion cube tribute on YouTube.
Yeah, that was... People have the dumbest shit on YouTube.
You were laughing though.
No, I was.
It was funny.
That one part though where they played the... You must now incinerate the cube or whatever.
Oh yeah, didn't they?
Oh yeah.
No, they played the one image in heap song that they always play for like every death scene ever that I've ever seen.
That was great.
Yeah, so like the video is like...
You know, it's doing its thing and it's showing, like, it's like a tribute.
And, like, I was expecting Journey to come in or something.
But then, like, you know, they have to throw the cube in the incinerator because that's what you do in one of the missions.
And then suddenly, you know, the definitive death song comes in.
No, not the companion cube.
And then they kept repeating it and speeding it up.
That was the best ever.
Forget it, I tried.
iTunes just isn't friendly to do that.
It's just like that one SNL digital short that they have.
It is.
It's a total parody of that one short.
It was just the best thing ever.
Dear Sister, thank you, TigerClaw, in the chat room, chat.northshelter.com.
I'll try to find the walkthrough I was watching, but I was watching part seven of the walkthrough, because that's my favorite one, because that's the one where the computer starts going nuts and says, you know, you must lay down in the party retrieval position.
Wow.
Alright, we gotta move on.
We don't have a portal show tonight.
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was okay.
I played Earth Defense Force 2017 again.
We went back to that and actually did pretty well on the Inferno levels.
Hopefully gonna try to finish that game eventually.
I tried a little bit of Mass Effect and there's a whole lot of talking in that game.
They really like to just, you know, use that.
They're like, man, we made a really cool conversation system.
Let's constantly use it.
It's like, my God, shut the hell up.
I want to go on a mission already.
You have the best game reviews, Loki.
Yeah, so I play Mass Effect and it's a lot of talking.
It seriously is.
It's just like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, my God.
You're here for some reason that's not, you know, good or something, and there's something going on.
I wonder what it is.
And, like, to this point, I'm like, I don't know who you are, nor do I care what's going on.
I just want to go fight something.
And, you know, when I did go fight something, there were these stupid little flying things that shot lasers at me, and...
My guys basically... I had one of my away team members that must have been Sergeant I'm Gonna Die or something because fucker just ran up, started shooting at it, and just stood out in the middle of the open instead of taking cover like a smart person and died instantly.
Naturally, there's feedback from the chat room here.
Odd1 says, Dear God, an RPG where I have to talk to people?
What the hell?
No, but they go on and on and on and on and on.
And I actually was skimming through it.
I mean...
If I wanted to talk to everybody, I could do that as well, and it's just, huh.
SSJ100Matt in chat.orange.studio.com says, They spend a lot on voice actors, Loki.
They gotta use them.
Well, yeah, true.
But no, don't get me wrong.
Speaker Uno invokes Elvis and says, A little more conversation.
Or no, a little less conversation.
A little more action, please.
Get it?
Get it?
I mean, but, you know, to be fair... Okay, to be fair, I played this game, you know, during a lunch, okay?
So, and only half of a lunch, so about 30 minutes.
But, dude, it took me 25 minutes to actually see some action in this game.
So, I mean, that's pretty bad.
But, you know, hey, it's gonna be pretty cool.
So, you know, I'm looking forward to playing a little bit more of the game when I stop playing other games, which one of those other games, of course, would be Rock Band.
And, you know...
I don't want to sound like a fanboy for Rock Band, because I don't really play... I bought Guitar Hero 2 a long time ago and didn't play that much of it.
Rock Band, though, has actually got me excited about music games again.
So, it's, you know, worth playing.
I like it.
I think it's pretty fun.
That's a big fucking statement there.
I mean, I'm actually working my way through the game on, you know, starting on Easy and then, you know, kind of building up from there.
But, um...
Thanks for watching!
I was actually playing on that one time.
Anyways, the drums are good, although I cannot play drums in the house anymore because my wife has told me not to because it's too loud.
They are very loud, those drums.
But it's fun.
I really like the drums in the game.
I have not touched the vocal part of the game yet, but the microphone that comes with it is really nice.
And I hear, though, you can use any USB microphone and it'll work just fine.
Also, I hear the rumor about the Guitar Hero 3 controllers not working in the game is false.
They do work in the game.
Oh, wow.
Oh, yeah.
I was going to say, that's what they were using for the demo unit at the Best Buy near my house.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yes.
I had known I had seen them before somewhere, and I didn't remember.
But I like the guitars that came with the Rock Band game.
Those were nice guitars.
They're nice.
They are really nice.
But yeah, the drums are pretty cool.
They get put together pretty fast.
I mean, it's okay.
I'm still having trouble coordinating both drums and the kick drum, but I have that problem with...
Drum Mania
Thanks for watching!
And it's a good 20 pounds when it's full of all the equipment.
It's a big, big box, and it's not even full right now.
That makes sense, though.
Yeah, I know.
But, yeah, the other bad thing about it, and I had to cut a hole in the side of the box, because right now I'm using up the carry stuff back and forth, is once you put the guitar together, because the little top part kind of snaps on, it doesn't fit in the box anymore.
So I had to cut a hole in the box for the guitar.
Anyway, so yeah, you can create your own characters.
I actually created an emo goth guy called Azrael for my guitarist.
Azrael Abyss!
That's what I was trying to do, but you couldn't fit Azrael Abyss, Prince of Sorrow in there, so I just had to stick with Azrael.
That's great!
It's pretty cool, though.
He looks, I don't know, kind of neat now.
Then my main character, Loki, who's playing drums...
has the Doctor Who jacket, which is kind of neat.
And then, I don't know.
There's a lot of things.
One of the guitars in the game is actually a chainsaw, which is kind of neat.
And then you can create probably a lot of characters that look like Sephiroth or Vincent and stuff.
Because there's a lot of outfits that look like you could make characters look like other things.
I loved the way that the custom characters interface themselves so well into the flow of the game.
They actually... They look like they're in pre-rendered movies.
Well, they actually, in the game, their mouths are synced up with the lyrics and everything.
Their playing is synced up with the song.
So they're not just like fake strumming of the guitar and stuff.
It's actually synced up with the song.
And the drummer actually drums to the song.
So it's pretty realistic.
I like...
The film, you know, graines on it.
But it is funny, though, watching this really emo-looking guy singing Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
Timmy, Timmy!
For East Pop Song, A++.
Yeah, it's a pretty cool game.
You can unlock the tracks pretty easy, too.
They have a bonus little venue that you play that unlocks all the unlockable tracks.
But in order to be able to play the songs in practice mode or whatever, you have to play them through the game.
I don't know, it's pretty nice, but...
I really recommend picking it up if you can find it.
I just know they're going to be really hard to find.
But if you can't find the game with all the instruments and you don't really care about drums too much, you can always pick up a USB microphone and just use your normal Guitar Hero guitar with the game only and save yourself some money that way.
I'll tell you right now where to get Rock Band.
If you go there the morning of the 20th when it comes out, right?
It's Tuesday when it comes out?
Morning of the 20th?
Kmart.
No one shops Kmart.
They might not be getting that many, though.
See, that's the thing.
Get there first.
Everyone's allocations are cut, so go to Best Buy or something like that if you can.
Anything else for your gaming week?
Uh... No.
My gaming week, not too incredibly exciting because I've been going back and forth between Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft.
I've been playing both.
I got my Corsair up to level 19 in Final Fantasy XI.
And, uh...
World of Warcraft 2.3
and so on.
It's sort of how dancers are in Ragnarok
Yes, and I think in the... Well, no, because in Tactics they were just female bards.
They were more buffers.
Well, yeah, they do more buffing, but they have range healing and stuff like that.
That's exactly how they made them in Final Fantasy XI, is that they're kind of like buffers, but with that range healing, but yet they can provoke the monster, and they're like tanks.
It's crazy.
Do they dance fight?
They just shake their ass.
Dude, you can be a Galka dancer.
There's videos on YouTube of the Galka dances.
It's awesome.
You use your TP to do attacks, but the thing is it's like the first job I can think of where you don't have to have 100% TP to do the special attacks.
There's things you can do with like 30 TP or 60.
And TP is the stuff you build up as you attack.
It's toilet paper.
Not that kind of TP.
Not for your bunghole.
You throw your toilet paper at them.
Yes.
Oh, I was... But then they do little jigs.
It's cute.
I also forgot, if you don't mind.
Sure.
I did make the guild for Ragnarok.
I would like to congratulate Ranma as being our first member.
Congrats.
And if you... The guild is just Orange Lounge Radio.
Very cool.
So look for the icon.
Check that out.
All right.
I'll have to show you the YouTube-age of the Galka dances later.
I have to see that.
Because Op 11 is slowing down our stream a little bit because we're doing too much bandwidth.
I can't handle it.
What else did I play?
Really quickly, I played that new word-searching game on Xbox 360, just the demo.
I was a little disappointed that it's just basically an over-glorified word-search game.
It just kind of seems like a casual game, something that Mom might like.
I don't know.
Mutant Storm Empire, though, much improved over the first Mutant Storm.
I think I need to go back and buy that one.
I think the greatest change they made to it is that they made levels feel more like levels, where it's almost like Smash TV, kind of, where you're walking through from room to room, and it doesn't have that really slow loading time transition between the different rooms.
Did you now buy the, or not buy, but download the free Casserone?
Carcassone?
Casserone is something you cook for dinner, I think.
Casserole!
Casserole.
Carcassonne, I already had it.
Calzone?
I got ripped off.
I already bought Carcassonne like two weeks ago, or not two weeks ago, like two months ago when it was, not when it was first out, but about a month after it was first out, I bought Carcassonne.
So I was kind of pissed when I heard that it was out for free.
But what can you do?
That kind of stuff happens.
That's pretty much it.
Pete Caruno played Screwjumper and said it sucks balls.
Well, yeah, this week's releases kind of suck balls.
All I heard is that Picaruno beat my Boom Boom Rocket score, so I know what game I've got to play this week.
And maybe, maybe I will use the guitar.
You know what we have to do, Rob?
What we didn't do last week?
Metroid!
We haven't done it in the past three months.
And I'm leaving on Thursday, so we'll have to do it early this week.
Soon?
I don't work Thursday and Friday, thankfully, but you're like, oh, I'm going to leave because I can't.
I'm leaving midnight, like when it turns midnight.
Right.
Yeah, so we'll have to do it on Tuesday.
All right.
Well, let's get into some housekeeping.
Speaking of Jamie leaving, Jamie will be on vacation for the next two weeks from the show, so she's not going to be here next week or the week after.
Cry.
How dare she?
Maybe she'll... But, Rob.
What?
Fried chicken.
Maybe she'll bless us with her presence via the telephone.
Who knows?
Maybe.
We'll see.
And, you know, monkeys might... Never mind.
I don't know if we'll have somebody else here or if it'll just be the Loki and Rob show.
I'm going to try to reach out to Rice Princess so we can have a female perspective of Jamie's absence, but I don't know if she can make it.
I'll have you know, Rob, the Wii Zapper comes out next week.
Oh, I have one.
How'd you do that already?
Freebies from the Game Crazy Manager thing.
How does that work?
What do we have that uses it?
But we have one!
We have a Wii Zapper.
All right.
But there's Link's crossbow training.
Oh, yeah, but I didn't care about that.
So, yeah, the great Loki and Rob challenge with the Wii Zapper might go down.
You should have Nellie come on the show.
Eh, she doesn't want to.
Perhaps.
She's got to watch Cesper Housewives.
We'll bribe her.
What few episodes are left while the Writers Guild's striking?
I told Dan to come on the show with me after I get back.
You should.
You should.
Dan on the show is... Comedy.
Yeah, it's hilarity.
Dan at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza was pretty funny.
I think, didn't he coin the phrase John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
No, that was me.
He had another term for it.
Incredibly Sucky Pizza.
Yeah, John's Incredible World of Suck or something.
Alright, anyway.
Our poor friend who works there.
Orange Lounge Radio Gamer Pick
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
Might I also add, there is lots of other great podcasts in Community Gamer Picks 1, and hopefully someday there'll be a Community Gamer Picks 3, but more of you guys have to download them and use them, and then they go, oh, people like this stuff, so we should get more blogs and more indie shows and that stuff in there.
So, very cool.
Also, after tonight's show, I think I already mentioned this, on Operator 11, a special live preview for Rock Band.
And last week we did one for Mario Galaxy, and the folks in chat really seemed to like that, and it was very well received.
So I'm hoping we can do more of these in the future, in these live preview shows on Sundays, and other Op 11 specials.
Alright.
Sky, DrunkShow
No, because I have to work the Monday after the four-day weekend, so not likely.
But you never know.
Stay tuned to the station.
You never know when we'll go live randomly.
And let's see.
What else do we have?
I thought there was another one I wanted to see.
Oh, Gerardimo says, Can Loki sing in the preview?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're going to have to bribe him.
I don't know, Loki.
What do you think?
Could you at least read us some news in a Tingle outfit?
No.
All right.
Could you at least read us some news?
Yeah.
Anyways.
So there was a big announcement about the fall update, or winter update, I guess now.
Actually, it kind of leaked out first that the Xbox Originals are going to be made available to download.
What those are basically going to be is just a selection of original Xbox games that you can download straight to your hard drive and play.
So this is actually going to be happening, it has been confirmed, and...
HALO, PSYCHONAUTS, KRIMSOM SKIES, FABLE
There were some other third-party ones that were also reported, which were Indigo Prophecy, Crash Bandicoot, Wrath of the Cortex, and Burnout 3 Takedown, which I thought was a pretty good Burnout game.
Let's see here.
Also, as part of the follow-up, they have, of course, that parental timer, and then who knows what else they'll throw in there as well.
But that's mainly the big thing.
Although, if you're expecting, you know,
Some wonderful things from these Xbox originals.
Time to kind of calm down a little bit because they're really just downloadable Xbox games.
That's it.
I mean, they're emulated through the same software that emulates the current Xbox games that you can just pop a disc in there.
So all the bugs that were in those emulations are going to be the same thing on these download titles.
So in other words, if you thought Microsoft was going to take the virtual console idea and do it better...
Wrong.
Yeah.
Basically, you know, they're going to have choppiness when the game's loading up.
Also, if there's content like demos and stuff, selecting them might actually crash the game.
You know, stuff that's on these original Xbox games.
So it's really just straight port, and they're just available to download.
No achievements, no nothing.
So that's it.
It's a little bit of a big deal.
But...
Cool news for people that maybe missed it, because there's some people who didn't buy an Xbox One who have an Xbox 360, you know what I mean?
So that might be good for them.
So, I mean, if you're up to it, they will be made available.
Obviously, this is an optional purchase.
You don't necessarily need to buy it, but I don't know.
VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV
But still, I probably wouldn't buy these things if I still have the discs sitting around.
Exactly, and the other thing too is, I mean, some of these games are pretty old.
I mean, you can probably find them really cheap if you really want to look for them.
Maybe this will be incentive, if they make money off this, maybe this will be incentive for them to go back to the, in the Xbox archive and make, because they haven't touched the backwards compatibility in a long time and made some more games like backwards compatible, like DDR, like still not backwards compatible, right?
Maybe this will be incentive for them to go dip in the library and make some old stuff backwards compatible.
But I swear to God, if they make things like Silent Hill 2 and Silent... Was Silent Hill 3 on Xbox?
I think it was.
I only had 2 and 4, so I don't know.
No, I don't think it was.
I was playing it on PS2.
But my copies have vanished probably when I moved, so I would download that shit in a heartbeat just to have the load times and stuff.
Some of that stuff's going to be cool, I think.
We'll see.
Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to mention during housekeeping that I totally forgot because we forgot to note it on our little notes thingy.
This is great what's been released from our community and it's on the forums and it's something called OL Revolution and it's basically a Stepmania pack with all these songs that are based on like inside jokes from the show and there's some completely horrid stuff in there like
Like five years ago when we would go on the stream randomly and I would sing over DDR songs, like people recorded that shit somehow and have stepped it.
And some of those like god-awful DMN remixes that he's taken, and I say that with love, that he's taken like bits and pieces of our show and put them over DDR songs, they're like all in there with steps.
And then like things that are in jokes to like other shows on the station, like just hilarious.
It's all in the forums.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But I swear to God, if that shit gets out, that karaoke stuff gets out there too much, I'm going to have issues.
We're going to have words, Dark Tetsuya, in the parking lot.
I'll kick your butt in Rock Band, which we were talking about a little earlier in the game.
Lots and lots of news coming out on Rock Band as the game gets closer and closer to release, including information about the download packs.
And Rock Band has decided they've got to stick it to Guitar Hero 3 by making the packs a little bit cheaper.
Instead of 500 points for Guitar Hero 3 packs, 440 Microsoft points.
That equates to, do the math in your head,
$5.49.
But you don't just have to buy songs in packs.
You can buy individual songs.
It could go anywhere from 80 Microsoft points to 240 Microsoft points.
That's $0.99 to just under $3.
Most of them, they say, will be $1.99, 159 Microsoft points.
Okay, 159 Microsoft points.
I'm going to have all these leftover stupid points somewhere.
Just do like...
160.
But I mean, they have so much stuff coming out just when the game comes out.
They have on November 20th, the Metallica Pack, the Police Pack, the Queens of the Stone Age Pack, and some individual tracks such as My Sharona and Cherry Bomb.
I would also like to point out that the week of November 27th, while Jamie is gone and she can't play it, there's a David Bowie pack coming out.
Ha ha.
Who says I can't play it?
Are you going to have Rock Band in Alabama?
Ha ha.
I think I want to get back.
Black Sabbath Pack comes out on December 4th.
That is so getting downloaded.
And December 18th, look at this, some individual tracks.
First you get a Pretender song, Brass in Pocket, Weezer, Buddy Holly, and just for you, DarkSakura, God is Listening, My Iron Lung by Radiohead on December 18th.
There you have it.
I loves me some Radiohead.
But see, it's kind of cool that they have stuff coming out each week.
That is very cool.
I hope it continues.
I hope we get stuff on Christmas.
We'll see.
I don't know.
I don't want to buy some of these.
Fortunate Son actually sounded kind of cool.
I like the fact that they have some individual pricing to it as well.
That's very cool.
Yeah, not all this I'm going to want to buy.
But I'm very happy.
Well, for anyone who is looking for these on Guitar Hero 3, there is a free Boss Battle download pack that's basically...
Just the devil went down to Georgia and all the other three boss battle songs, so that's pretty cool.
But I think that the best part about it is that it's free.
I like free.
Free is good.
So you can play these outside of career mode.
Awesome.
Anyways, something not... Wait, wait, wait.
Yeah, I ran out real quick, but I wanted to comment on that.
It...
I'm glad they did it for free because otherwise we all would have been screaming that it was pay-to-unlock content because those songs were kind of already in the game.
But I think it's a nice little extra.
It's nothing huge.
But The Devil Went Down to Georgia is an awesome song, so I'm really glad they made that available to play whenever I want.
I like that cover.
Yes, so good jobs.
Okay, now, Loki, you can go.
Anyways, so UK retailer Tesco actually slipped up because on their online store they were selling the Xbox 360 Hollative Bundle, which is normally 340 pounds.
They were selling it for only 33 pounds.
Whoopsie!
And apparently it was long enough for a number of customers to order the system and
Although Sky News is saying that once the payment is accepted, trading standards rules in the UK state that the retailer must comply and deliver the product.
However, they have said, despite the rules, Tesco site maintains that they do not have to conform to erroneously marked prices unless they fail to notice before shipment.
That's going to cause a stink.
but there was apparently some consumers like one that ordered 39 consoles although none of them have been delivered yet.
They'd have to do at least a full refund on price.
Yeah, especially like, you know, you consider that guy probably thought he was doing a smart thing.
Hopefully they won't try to like charge him for all those Xbox 360s or he's not going to be happy.
I don't think they can do that.
Probably not.
Probably not.
I want to point out
In response to the last story, because there's a bit of a delay from when we say it to when the live listeners hear it, Actdeft says, Free is good, except for Yaris.
Good point.
You do pay in time, don't you?
I have more Rock Band stuff, and this is not going to be free, sadly, but this sounds like really cool.
This came from an interview with the official Xbox magazine, and some more details have surfaced from Harmonix about Rock Band, and apparently...
You're going to be able to take your band and export it to a webpage.
And from there, you can take band avatars, pose your band avatars, make album covers with your band logo, make all these different scenes, and then you can turn that into real world stuff.
You can make figurines based on these rock band characters, t-shirts that have the fake album art on them, and then tour dates that are just basically the accomplishments from the game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's still kind of neat.
There is the Madden thing where you can buy a fucking ring for like $500.
That's true.
That's a little crazy.
I'm excited to see how this plays out because obviously it's not up there yet, but it must be coming soon because the game is out on Tuesday.
I will say, though, there are some pretty interesting scenes.
There are some of the load screens on there.
They will have fake album art and stuff like that and fake little portraits and stuff with your characters that you design in it.
I thought the trivia was interesting.
We played the Freeze Pop song and it said something about Freeze Pop once got arrested in Canada and ate lots of poutine.
And I was like, that's completely random.
I'm like, wow.
I'm like, do people outside of Canada even know what poutine is?
I don't think so.
We'll see.
Anyway.
I don't know what it is.
It's basically french fries and gravy.
That sounds really yummy.
Fuck.
I have Canadian friends online that blog about it.
It's so good, apparently.
I don't know.
I know we've got Canadian listeners.
I kind of do that with my leftover chips from the British food store.
All right.
I put chip shop curry on it.
Why is it this show always turns into the food show?
Because we're hungry.
Does food and gaming go hand in hand like that?
Yes.
All right.
Anyhow.
Well, for other stuff, Rob, the
For anyone who is familiar with Atlas USA, they are bringing out Spectral Force 3 and Operation Darkness for Xbox 360, which is pretty cool.
Atlas gave us Trauma Center on Wii, so we are getting their new localizations.
And they made the cute little tactical game with the voice acting on PS2.
God damn it, why can't I think of it?
Really popular, just got a sequel recently.
Disgaea.
Thank you, Disgaea.
Disgaea, yeah.
And Persona, they made that too.
Yep, and we like Persona.
Well, they published it.
So we're getting more.
Oh, true, true.
Yes, they're publishing, but yeah, we're getting more fun.
Big difference, my bad.
But I was going to say that Operation Darkness looked like crap, by the way.
It's like, I don't know, it looked dumb from when I remember when they were first showing video of that.
Anywho, so Lionhead...
You may remember them from the Fable series.
Well, they're looking for some custom insults for Fable 2.
So they actually have a whole thing where you can submit your insults to them, and apparently if they like it, they will put it in the game.
So that's kind of neat.
I have one.
Your gameplay makes me want to go play a PlayStation 3.
Is that good?
No.
No.
Some of the ones that they were saying that were on there already, Groin Crab, Loner McLonleyton, and Big Girls Blouse, which I don't understand that.
What do you think would happen if I submitted their names to call people?
You know, to be honest, all they need to do is monitor names and little catchphrases that are in Animal Crossing because, I mean, that's what people do anyway.
Oh, good point.
NintendoManiac64 in chat says, Sky, instead of PlayStation 3 on that console, try N-Gage.
That's good.
Burn!
Oh, snap.
I was going to say, as a joke, if you're supposed to submit things that are name-calling or whatever, let's all submit Bobby Blackwolf as a name-calling thing.
Funny.
Just kidding, Bobby, if you're listening.
Hearts.
All right, moving on.
One thing that they don't want you putting your opinions in and don't want you asking about anymore is Bioshock on the PlayStation 3.
Damn it, Sony fanboys.
2K Games has given you the smackdown.
It is not happening.
It's an official response on the 2K forums.
And this is what the moderator had to say, quote, Please don't tell me you made an account just for this question.
There will be no PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock.
It has been explained time and time again.
So if you were hoping to save some, what do they call them, little sisters on the PlayStation 3 version, not going to happen.
Sorry, kids.
Bioshock 2?
You never know.
I mean, you know there's got to be a Bioshock 2 at some point.
This game's getting amazing reviews, but Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3?
Well, if there's enough PlayStation 3s out there, they'll probably do it.
So, that's that.
No Bioshock for you PlayStation 3 kids.
But, but, but, we like... No!
Okay.
I said no!
Well, they are now putting out something very interesting for PlayStation 3.
I think this is very interesting.
Um...
Trend Micro Incorporated is putting out antivirus software for the Playstation 3.
It's
I don't know, that's sort of interesting, but they're saying that the home systems now are going to be vulnerable to spyware and viruses for being able to go on the internet.
Is that so my PlayStation 3 doesn't get herpes?
I don't know if it's antivirus software, but I think Trend Micro is doing the parental controls on the internet browser that they're going to add.
I think they've already added them with...
and DarkSakura.com
What?
Sad.
Anyways, I got it for free.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
They come out for like one or two games, and then they're not continued to be supported, therefore the peripherals never sell.
You have to make a ton of games for the peripherals in order for them to finally sell.
Like, for example, for example here, the Xbox Vision camera.
Yeah, exactly.
That is a piece of useless crap, and I'm sad to have made that mistake twice now with both the iToy and the Vision camera.
and that's why I haven't bought a PlayStation Eye yet because I don't want to buy another useless camera.
Exactly.
How many things can you use that stupid vision cam for?
One, to make your own icon on Xbox Live that only your friends can see.
Yay, Totem Ball!
That game was awesome!
I'm not even going to count Totem Ball because that's something against the Xbox Live camera.
And then there's Strip Uno.
That's it.
That's all the cam is good for.
And they also have strip, you know, checkers, strip chests.
Yeah, and I guess you also have hardwood hearts or whatever.
But who plays those games?
Hardwood hearts.
But seriously, did you play the spy glass games or whatever it was called?
It was kind of crap.
It was kind of sloppy.
I don't know.
I didn't like it at all.
Just because, you know, a game supports the fucking camera, which, to be honest, I think all of the games should support the damn camera.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Jason brings up a point, Texas Hold'em supports it now, I forgot about that Oh yeah, that is true I haven't played Texas Hold'em in a long time Which is too bad because I think we were invited to a tournament And that reminds me, I need to reply to that email Because we're being stuck up by not replying, my bad Alright, but we really suck at Hold'em Is anybody good at Hold'em?
I was okay Really, you should play for us then, I don't want to play I'm not that good
I'm okay at it.
We could all play.
We could all go to the same place and play together.
I have better things to play.
I played Hold'em once with Bobby for maybe 20 minutes and that was it.
All right, anyhow, very cool news for the PlayStation 3.
Yes, that's right.
Very cool news for the PlayStation 3.
I'm completely serious here.
Yeah, I know.
DivX is going to be partnering with Sony.
This is based on an announcement from DivX.
They're going to be integrating its video playback technology into the PlayStation 3.
So if you update your development kits to 2.0, you can already utilize the DivX technology for your games.
And hopefully...
If DivX gets enabled in a future PlayStation 3 firmware upgrade, which at this point, who's to say why wouldn't it, then you can actually watch all the porn that you download over the internet and all the pirated movies.
You'll be able to watch that over your local network.
That would be totally useful for someone who pirates.
Too bad that I will not be using that.
Yes, not that you should be pirating.
That's wrong.
And yeah, you should not be doing that.
Well, if it's on the internet, it must be okay to download, right?
I mean, they wouldn't put something illegal on the internet, would they?
No, of course not.
That's just completely... Question from OL Army Ninja in chat.
Did OLR really just go two whole stories about Sony and not bad talk them?
Look, we said a long time ago, when Sony does something right, we will give them credit for it.
And then we'll make fun of them for everything else.
I'm equally offensive against all consoles.
Like, for example, this week's live edition, fucking Shrek enroll in Screwjumper.
What the fuck is that shit?
Shrek enroll.
First of all, Shrek should never be on the fucking Xbox Live Arcade ever.
Orange Bucks
Portal.
That is no lie, unlike the cake.
Portal.
Yeah, are you saying just buy this game for Portal and the hell with everything else?
Just buy it for Portal and the hell with everything else.
Although I did find a very interesting thing on looking, because I was reading some of the forums about it, because people are trying to piece in where Portal is supposed to fit in the Half-Life story, which I thought was really cool speculation, because I love speculating about storylines and things.
Hold on.
Are you telling me there's Portal fanfic?
No.
It actually does fit.
There is.
And there's weighted companion cube fan art.
Ah!
As long as it's not weighted companion cube slash, then we're okay.
No, but I was reading just how they were speculating how it fitted in, and someone was saying that there's a way that you can import the Half-Life 2 maps into Portal, and you can use the Portal gun in Half-Life 2.
I think it's the other way around.
It was saying specifically that they moved the maps to the Portal folder.
It was using some program or something.
I think it's the other way around.
They imported the portal gun into Half-Life 2.
But yeah, you can do that.
Anyways, I was going to say there is... You can probably do both.
If you notice in the game, actually there's a few times where you can see through the window and there's a little slide projector.
They're showing Aperture Science versus I don't remember what the other corporation is in Half-Life 2, so forgive me there.
But a whole little thing about that.
I guess they're making competing technologies and stuff.
And it's even in the song, too.
They're talking about that whole thing.
Why are people in the chat saying Rule 34 and laughing?
Is that a Portal joke that I don't get?
I don't know.
I still haven't played it.
Maybe I'll download it on Steam this week.
We'll see.
I can't tear myself away from the MMOs long enough.
Forgive me.
So, Assassin's Creed, it's quite interesting.
There's been reports coming out now that the PlayStation 3 version, let's see here.
Oh, I'm sorry, that's your story.
Never mind.
PlayStation Store updates, yes.
Lots of cool stuff for the PlayStation Store this week, including actually one that I was kind of looking at, although I played something very similar to it.
I want to say it was actually on the PlayStation Network.
Toy Home, it's a little car racing game, kind of like Micro Machines or something like that.
High Velocity Bowling Time Crisis 4, Battlefield, Bad Company, Burnout Paradise Other than...
Dark Knight Teaser Trailer
DarkSakura.com
You might want to watch out for this, though, or maybe you won't get to access that PlayStation Store.
And that is the brand-newly-discovered white screen of death on the PlayStation 3.
And the cause?
Assassin's Creed.
Apparently, some folks who are using firmware 2.0 are getting the white screen of death while playing Assassin's Creed.
This is coming up on posts on the Ubisoft forums.
And apparently, there's a lot of folks that are posting about these freezing issues and bug glitch issues.
So, there you have it.
No real...
and DarkSakura.
Yeah, the game actually had a worse frame rate slightly than the Xbox 360 version.
And there's also some videos online of some pretty weird glitches in the game, like one where you fall through the earth.
There's another one where your character kind of clones himself.
And so you're controlling two copies of your character.
Now, someone on my friends list played both and actually said the PlayStation 3 is a little better.
So maybe if these issues don't come to haunt you, then you're...
You're fine.
It doesn't matter.
I was going to say also that the game ain't that good.
That's another thing.
You didn't like it, really?
No.
I've heard a lot of good things about it.
I've played a little bit of it.
I've played it, yeah, but a lot of people are really liking it.
What else was I going to say about that?
What is it you don't like about it?
It's boring.
It really is.
It's not as... You can kill people.
Okay.
Well, that's like any game.
So, I don't know.
I just didn't care for it.
I didn't see what the fuss was about.
All right.
Well, there was a rumor circulating around that Capcom was thinking about putting a Resident Evil 5 demo on the Blu-ray for Resident Evil Extinction.
And also another one saying that Devil May Cry 4 would have a demo on there.
But Capcom said, uh-uh, they're just putting trailers up.
That would have been so cool, though.
I know.
There's a lot of people very excited about Resident Evil 5.
Capcom should do it.
I'm still... The demo is a lie.
They should put like a really crappy demo for something.
Just have like, you know, a stick figure with like a... They should put Doom on there.
Yet another bastardization of Mega Man.
No, they should do like Resident Evil with Doom graphics.
With all pixel...
I like this.
Odd1 in chat says, God, I need that Resident Evil 5 demo.
Notice how it's not like I want, I wish they would put it out there.
He says, I need it.
I need it now.
I need Animal Crossing Wii, but I'm just going to have to wait a little longer.
Life sucks.
Wait.
Dennis Leary says, life sucks, wear a helmet.
Life's going to suck when you grow up.
That's all I know.
Anyways, well, there's a few games, though, that you're not going to have to wait much longer to play, and that's the stuff coming out this week.
So, in the U.S., starting off here... Oh, dear God, Friday.
I know, oh my God, the release dates for Japan are huge.
Everybody, give sympathy to our... Everybody, get a book, get a pillow, we're going to have a long segment for release dates this week.
Everybody, feel sorry for our retail workers this Friday.
No, it's not going to be a long segment, actually, there's not a lot coming out this week.
Oh my God, the Japanese ones are huge.
Anyways, I was just going to mention, I think this came out last week already, and I have kind of a last-minute story about it later on.
Avatar, the Burning Earth, now the new record holder for the fastest way to get achievements on Xbox 360.
Hooray.
So that's coming out now.
Baby Pals on the DS.
Yes, it's another fucking baby-raising sim.
Wait, did you say baby-raising or baby-racing?
Oh my god, a baby-racing game?
That would be awesome.
A baby-racing game would be hardcore.
I'd buy that shit.
Developers, are you listening?
Baby-racing.
More babies!
Babies versus kittens.
Who will win?
Anyways, Cabela's Monster Bass.
It's a bass fishing game on the PlayStation 2.
College Hoops 2K8 is coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360 this week.
CSI Dark Motives.
CSI game on the DS.
Apparently a venture game.
Kind of crappy.
The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific.
Another piece of shovelware on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3.
Did you call that shovelware?
Yeah.
What does that mean?
It means it's crap.
Oh, anyways.
No, actually, it's on PlayStation 2 this week because the other games got delayed.
Imagine Fashion Designer on the PC.
Yes, you too can design crap.
Mario Party DS.
That's going to be a good game, so pick that one up.
Medal of Honor Airborne for the PlayStation 3.
I guess better late than never.
Monster Jam on the Wii.
Same there.
Let's see... Time Crisis 4, which is including the Gun Con.
That's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 3.
So it might be worth picking up if you like gun games.
Unreal Tournament 3, coming out on PC.
So that should be pretty awesome.
No word on the PlayStation 3 version yet.
Let's see... World of Warcraft, March of the Legion.
You know, the card game.
I don't know if anyone's interested in the World of Warcraft card game.
Let's see here...
Soldier of Fortune Payback on the PlayStation 3 actually got delayed to this week, which I thought was kind of interesting.
AMF Bowling Pinbusters on the Wii.
I don't know if this is a good game or not, but it's only $20.
So if you like bowling and you're a little tired of Wii Sports bowling, you might want to check that out.
Then finally, Final Fantasy Online, they have the Vanadil Collection 2008 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, which is going to include, of course, all the previous expansions, the original game, and of course, the other thing that's coming out this week, the Final Fantasy XI Online Wings of the Goddess expansion, which should make some people happy.
Yay!
Let's see then.
Oh, and that's also coming on PC as well.
Then on...
on the DS, John Deere, Harvest in the Heartland.
It's a farming sim for real.
Take that, Harvest Moon.
Luxor Pharaoh's Challenge on PlayStation 2.
That'll probably suck.
Ghost Squad on the Wii, which I highly recommend you pick up.
That's only $29.99, so definitely a great gun game for the Wii.
And also uses the Wii Zapper, which is also coming out this week.
Soul Calibur Legends, which I heard sucked, has come out on the Wii.
Rock Band, of course, probably the biggest game this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, both the special edition and the game only.
And then Showtime Boxing on the Wii also sucked.
Star Trek Conquest on PlayStation 2 also sucked.
Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake, probably also sucks.
Final Fantasy XII, Revenant Wings, that game sucked.
Pretty good on the DS.
Godzilla Unleashed also sucked.
And I believe that is it.
And you said there's not a lot coming out this week.
Come on, that took like five minutes.
That's because I'm slow.
All right.
Wings of the Goddess
Anyhow, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally makes its way to the Xbox 360 as well this week in Japan.
Also coming out, Medal of Honor Airborne, also for the 360, and another 360 game.
And you didn't think there was anything for the 360 in Japan.
Winning Eleven 2008 makes its way to Japan.
Coming to the Wii this week in Japan, Dragon Blade comes out.
This is from D3, is publishing this.
Yep, looks like another role-playing game.
It's an action game like God of War.
It's a rip-off of God of War, but it's not even close to being as good as God of War.
Interesting, because from the box art and everything, it looks like your typical RPG, but there you have it.
Mario & Sonic at the Olympics makes its way to Japan, also on the Wii this week, the 22nd.
Coming out on PlayStation 3, another version of Harry Potter, because of course those games come out on every console.
Also, Remi no Oishi Restaurant, which you know better on these shores as Ratatouille.
That movie, Ratatouille, whatever.
PlayStation 2 Princess Osagasi
Dragon Quest IV
Dragon Quest IV
Uno Ikusi, IQ Breeder is coming out, and it looks like something between a dog sim and a brain training game.
So that's great.
Take your two biggest DS games, cram them together, and you have this game.
Lovely.
Maybe it's where you beat the dog until it's smart.
I somehow doubt that.
Aw.
All right, there it is, your Japanese releases.
P-p-p-puppies.
Okay, well, there's a crap load of stuff coming out in the U.K.,
On the 22nd, we have Final Fantasy XI, Wings of the Goddess.
Yay.
Smarty Pants on Wii.
23rd, Ace Combat 6, Fires of Liberation, which actually is not all that great.
I will tell you that from experience.
Beowulf, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II, Code Lyoko, I guess.
CSI, Crime Scene Investigation, Hard Evidence.
Dewey's Adventure, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock on a bunch of stuff, Jackass the Game, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, Kane and Lynch, Deadman, Lair, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, Mass Effect, Medal of Honor Heroes 2, My Horse and Me.
I just think that's a funny name.
Oh, how can I forget Mass Effect?
Boo Loki.
Boo you, whatever.
NBA 2K8, Need for Speed Pro Street, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance, Siphon Filter, Logan Shadow, Time Crisis 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Warhammer 40K, Squad Command.
I hate Warhammer.
Oh, we got some stories in there you'll like later.
Is that it?
Yeah.
Wow.
You just threw that mic down at the mere mention of Warhammer.
The fuck is Warhammer shit?
I have bad memories of Warhammer.
Do share.
I dated a guy who was a Warhammer player and all he did was play Warhammer.
Replace Warhammer with World of Warcraft and you have a lot of relationships in this day and age.
He would spend hours painting his stupid little models.
And where the stupid little models were kind of cool, I was like, dude, you are too obsessed with this shit.
I got too bored with painting the models, so I just, you know.
The models suck.
They're like a few millimeters tall.
It's like, fuck, I can't paint this shit.
My dog ended up eating a lot of them anyways.
So, wow.
But they were cool.
Yeah, for a while.
Anyways, one thing that's also cool, although it's a little late for it about now, is a new Terminator game.
Yes, Halcon is adapting Terminator for a brand new game.
Hopefully it's not based off the new Terminator series, which I'm sure is going to blow.
I'm sure tons.
I was just going to say this Terminator thing comes just in time for the Sarah Connor Chronicles, which I'm sure tons of people will be watching this winter on Fox during the writer's strike.
Yes, Sarah Connor Chronicles.
It's fucking emo shit, just like goddamn, um...
was it Smallville or something like that where they just there's Terminators coming after me it's like seriously they're just going to keep coming after you until you die so get used to it it also has the you better not make my character gay kid from Heroes in it who was then written out of the show remember that the management was like
and DarkSakura.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Terminator Salvation The Future Begins Lame!
But that's going to be coming out later.
I love this comment from Odd1 in our chat room, who's making a lot of win comments tonight.
Good job.
Odd1 says, Terminator without the Terminator.
Great.
Next up, Star Wars without lightsabers and Doctor Who based in South Central LA.
There you have it.
Doctor Who-ed.
Doctor Who-ed.
That's not funny.
Yes, it is.
You're smiling.
By the way, did you know I have to play Doctor Who this weekend at the show?
I need to go out and buy some Converse this weekend.
It kept going back and forth.
I was going to be Professor X, not Doctor Who.
Go to Payless and get Airwalks.
They're more comfortable.
We'll see.
All right, anyhow.
I just think the Terminator...
Seriously, it's like, I know why they announced that they're making a new Terminator game to kind of build off the hype of other announcements out there, but I mean, how can you get excited about a game that's going to come out for like two years about the Terminator?
Unless fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be back into it, which he's not because he's in the fucking political game now.
I don't know.
I just can't get all excited.
I mean, seriously, what good Terminator games have there been out there, excluding Terminator the arcade game, which was Terminator 2 the arcade game.
I was going to say Terminator 2 the arcade game.
Which was okay as a gun game, but really it wasn't that great.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Which is, you know, if you've listened to this game for any length of time, you know I have a lot of love for the very first Civilization game.
And the others that have come out since then have kind of turned me off.
And for that, I never touched Civ IV.
But I need to go give it a try now, because I have been playing GameTap.
I definitely want to go check that out.
The other ones are just too complicated.
I like my Civ Simple, which Civ I was.
So, anyhow, for the record, when the service started, there were only 300 games available on it.
Now there are a thousand.
So on GameTap.com is the information on all the games that are on the service, plus this interesting little picture.
You know those big pictures that are made up of little pictures?
They have one of those.
A mosaic?
Thank you, a mosaic.
The word escaped me.
They have that, but you can do a mouseover on all the little box arts and see what games they are.
Yay, box arts!
That's exactly what I said.
Yay, box arts.
DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week
The Guardian Legend The Guardian Legend
And, um, it starts off as a shooter, and then it's like an adventure RPG sort of thing.
And you talk to these little guys called Blue Landers, who look a lot like Lolo.
And, um, it's basically as you're going through it, you know, you have to pick up your power-ups, you actually, um...
As your score goes up, you earn different other power-ups and more chips.
This is how your power-ups are stored.
And then you earn more life, too, as you go through the game until you're the super-powered badass.
There were a couple of neat glitches in the game.
One of them where if you had a barrier up the middle, if you held diagonally, you could actually walk through the barrier.
DarkSakura,
I'm glad you didn't use this one video file that I linked you to because that person could not play the first level for shit.
No.
I did my own searching around YouTube to find this clip.
It's a little better.
So here's some overworld music, and then I'm going to switch to Jamie's favorite song in the game.
Yeah.
Play a little bit of it.
The one cool thing about this is, for anyone who doesn't know too much about it, the original game was actually on the MSX called Gartic.
And this is actually the sequel to that, Guarded Gaiden, which was what it was called in Japan.
It was also put out by Compile that gave us a bunch of really, really cool games.
Actually, another one of my favorite shooters was Robo Aleste, which is, you know, they just did a whole crap ton of shooters.
This is somebody shooting the gun repeatedly to open the corridor.
Because every corridor had its own little trick to open it.
Let me actually switch.
I'm going to switch to the music that Jamie says is her favorite in the game, which is the music to Corridor No.
6.
Here's the overworld music after that.
Oh, it's the overworld music.
The overworld music.
Yeah.
Well, this music's good, too.
I like this one, too, but the overworld music was my favorite.
Go ahead.
I'll skip ahead a little bit in the video.
Not that one.
Well, damn it.
It was right before that.
It was right before this?
I think it's right after here.
That's the destruction of Corridor 15.
You know, I love this game.
There's no easy way to say it.
I don't know what it is about this game.
I think it's the fact that it's like a little bit of everything, which for the ADD gamer like me is wonderful.
And like, I don't know like...
What we have to do to get a sequel to this game that doesn't suck.
I realize there might be licensing issues and who owns the works and such and such, but my god, I beg you, if you're out there and you have the power to make a sequel to this game happen that doesn't suck, please do.
What would technically be the third in the trilogy, then?
I guess that's true, because you do count Guardic, but Guardic, it's not nearly as memorable as this game.
If you've seen Guardic, it's not that exciting.
This really took it to a whole new level.
Well, um...
There is actually another glitch in the game, and I had actually remembered this because I had a glitched copy, my very first one was.
If you got your score to 10 million points, the game would crash and you couldn't play anymore.
So the later releases would only let you go up to a maximum score of 9,999,990, because the points were all multiples of 10.
and for anyone who's a big fan of the Compile games, the Blue Lander is actually one of their mascots and was also in the Sega Master System game called Govelius.
Nice.
So there you go.
Yes, it was not made by Square, chat room.
This is made by Compile, published by Broderbund here in the U.S.
Yep.
So there you have it.
And because none of those companies exist anymore, that's why it's sadly unlikely we're going to see this, but...
Possibly this game could make its way to Virtual Console only based on the fact that Lode Runner was also a Broderbund game and that did come out on Virtual Console for TurboGrafx.
So you never know.
Nothing is impossible, I suppose.
But this is one of my... Not only does Jamie love this game, I do too.
I don't know how Loki feels about it, but he better like it or he's fired.
So there you go.
Classic game of the week, Guardian Legend.
