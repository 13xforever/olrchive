Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now, the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 11th of 2007.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Remember, we are released in two parts every week.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
So if you missed part A, you can go check it out on our podcast feed in the archives.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Or, of course, there's always our live webcam feed on Operator 11.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Visit www.operator11.com.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
And sometimes we do some other little bonus shows, too.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
In fact, we're going to be showing off a new game tonight after the show.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
So check our Operator 11 archives for that.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
And Loki is going to start us off.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Anyways, some fun stuff, of course. We got to check this out a little bit during the break here.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
But the Check Me Out channel has finally been released on the Wii.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
So you can go download it now from the Wii shop there.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
And, of course, it's actually pretty cool.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
They have a bunch of different things you can do in there.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
You can browse the top voted... I guess it's like Hot or Not for Miis.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
You can browse the top voted Miis in there.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
You can check out some random ones, download the ones you like, which is pretty cool.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Post the ones you think are cool.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Other people will rate them.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Then they have themed contests.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
The one going on right now is Design a Mi that looks like Mario without his hat.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Which I've seen a Mi like that.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I think it's on my list. I should just submit that.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I should totally plagiarize. No, I won't do that.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Well, I think if they have the person's name on it, though, it's going to credit them.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
So it's not going to say you did it.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
But that's basically what it is.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
And it's pretty cool looking.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah, kind of interesting. We tape live on Sundays.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And literally, during the break between part A and B,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
because we take about a 10-15 minute break between the two parts when we're taping live,

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
is when the message came on the Wii that the channel was up.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
So, Loki and I briefly looked for like five minutes of the new channel during the break.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
And some pretty interesting Miis in there.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I like there was like a Jordy LaForge Mi that was in there.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Somebody had created a little miniature picture of like a penguin on somebody's face.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Like I thought that was really good skills.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
They have some pretty cool Miis on there.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't know if I could post some of the ones I've made, though.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, you might get rejected.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
What happens if you send penis head in? That might get rejected.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
That would not be good.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Very cool. So for those of you guys listening live,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
for those of you in our chat room and listening live to us on Sunday,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
go check that out if you have a Wii. It's up now.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And you can look at some Miis.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
And I was just looking at random Miis, and some of them are interesting.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
But I thought what was interesting is that one of the Miis that came in the random pool,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
because you could put just pool random 50 Miis,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
was exactly like a Mi one of my friends had created on my machine.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
It was the exact same thing, but it was somebody else's name.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm wearing a different color. It was so weird.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
So weird.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I guess certain faces are still popular. I don't know.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
But anyway, the Check Me Out channel is available right now.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
And by the time most of you guys hear this, it will have been out for actually quite some time.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Something moving on, speaking about the Wii.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
The Wii has been rumored earlier this week based on a comment from Reggie Fils-Aime

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
to have 200 virtual console games by the year's end.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And people were kind of freaking out, like, wait a minute.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
In order for the Wii to have that many games by the year's end,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
they're going to have to really step up their production

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
by putting out like four and a half games a week.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Four to five games every week.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Sorry, this week you're going to get the first half of...

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Some of those old games they put out should only count as half a game, honestly.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
But Nintendo put out an official statement that Reggie was only approximating,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
that there's not actually going to be 200 virtual console games by the year's end.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
But there will be about 180 if they keep up their current output.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
So there you have it.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Lots and lots of stuff to check out, the old school stuff.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
However, I would like to point out we are, what, 160 games in so far,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
and still no guardian legend.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
This makes me a sad panda.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
That is sad.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
It is a crime.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Awful.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
So I don't know what rights you have to get,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
but you better get those really quick.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
So that's all I have to say about the virtual console.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, for our friends in the UK,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Super Mario Brothers 3 is heading to virtual console.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Actually, we are getting it on Monday.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Is that correct?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
We got it this Monday.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah, we already...

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Yes.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
This Monday.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And it's going to be 500 Wii points.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Also coming out is Blue's Journey for the Neo Geo,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
and that will be 900.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
And also Power Golf for Turbo Graphics 16 for 600 points.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Well, I'm glad to see that Super Mario Brothers 3

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
is making the rounds worldwide, because it is a great game.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
It is one of the all-time great NES classics,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
so everybody gets to enjoy it now.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Hooray.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Yay.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Anyways.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
So apparently some best buys have been breaking the street

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
on Super Mario Galaxy and settling it early.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Shame on them.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
And apparently a few people have been buying

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
according to the Games Facts forum thread, I guess.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
They have pictures online, including stuff.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
But hey, you only have to wait a couple more days to play it,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
so hooray.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Now, if they had Super Smash Brothers,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
that would be a feat.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I somehow don't think they can get that right now.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
AZHP is in our chat room and is bragging,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I got a copy.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
So apparently somehow some folks were able to get one

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
from Best Buy, so good job to those folks.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Moving on.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Speaking of Super Mario Galaxy, right now,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
right this very minute, there is an event going on

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
at the Nintendo World Store in New York City.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
It is the Mario Galaxy Launch Party.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
It's going on right now.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
I think it started at 8 p.m. is when it started.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
But it's only been going until 10 p.m.,

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
so I guess it is going to end pretty soon here,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and then it's going to reopen again at midnight.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I guess the game officially goes on sale at midnight tonight.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
So the whole thing is going on right now.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
And apparently they've had a DJ, dancers, a Velcro wall,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
a bungee run, trivia contest,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and a laser light show inside the building.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
And apparently Mario himself, or at least a fat guy

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
in a Mario outfit, is there as well.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
250 Wii systems also on sale at the Nintendo World Store.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
And actually one of our listeners is there live

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
and is supposed to be calling us any minute now

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
with a call, a report from there,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
so we might have to interrupt.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Oh, here we go.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I think this is the call coming in right now.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Who's this?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Hi, this is Zaku.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Hey, Zaku, how are you doing?

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I'm just here in the rock right here

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
just seeing Mario Galaxy on screen

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
and people just going after T-shirts

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
and just freaking my ass off.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
So, yeah, that's pretty much it.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
What the hell's going on?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I mean, there's almost black right now.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
What the hell have they been doing there tonight, Zaku?

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
They've had a Velcro wall?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Large party.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
They have a live T-shirt right now.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
They're giving out free shit.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
There's people waiting in line for the launch,

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
and I know one of them is the one that actually got

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
the first Wii in this country last year

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
in front of us in Times Square.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
That same guy.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Wow.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
That same guy with the power glove on his right hand.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
There's some hard...

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
He's up on the line like one of the first two.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
There's some hardcore people out there right now.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, I can't hear that much right now.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
What?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I was just going to say, it sounds like there's some hardcore people there.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
There's like a few dozen people.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
But there's like, let me see,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
I count maybe 50 or 70,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
or like 60 people just waiting in line right now.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
So tell us more about...

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I've seen beyond the store and into the other buildings.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Tell us more about the special events that are going on.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Have you actually been able to get your hands on the game yet?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yes, I played it.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
They had like three guys with monitors

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
basically sticking out from like a rod

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
or something that they're carrying on their back with the game.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Kind of like how they did it last year with the segway.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
You know, the Wii hooked up to the segway,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
now they're basically walking.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
They're carrying all that gear, walking the game,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
you know, bringing the game to you by foot.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Wow.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Our chat room is just pretty excited to be hearing

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
the actual live report from the show going on right now.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
In fact, Frisbee in our chat room says,

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
this is the first time I've heard Zaku call in and not sound sleepy.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
So you definitely are excited to be there, right?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
No.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Oh, come on.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I had to bust my ass in the cold.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
What do you think?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I pretty much kept going to get some coffee

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
and taking a leak just to get this call through.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
But yeah, so far it's been good.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I mean, the game pretty much plays like Mario 64,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
only with motion control and slightly better depth.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Awesome.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
Well, can you give a shout out to the entire crowd

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
that Orange Launch Radio says hello?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm outside of the crowd.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
It's pretty thick right there.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
It's going to be hard to get inside there.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Can you give a big shout out to everybody around you

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
that Orange Launch Radio says hello?

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
Oh, man, random strangers just saying some crazy stuff.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
If I knew about this earlier, then I would have just done my whole body

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
with all our motion stuff.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
It's all good.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
It would have put the website down.

10:00.000 --> 10:08.000
It's all good.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Zaku, thanks so much for the report and have fun at the event.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And don't go too crazy, okay?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
All right.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Take care, buddy.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Have a good one.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
I'll see you guys later.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Later.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
Poor guy.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
That's one of our infamous callers, the legend of Zaku,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
calling us live from the Mario launch event

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
at the Nintendo World Headquarters in New York City.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Isn't that fun when we can do live reports like that?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
More stuff needs to happen on Sunday nights when we can do that.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Good times.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
You can definitely hear, like, in the background,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
like there's tons of people there.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
It's amazing.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
All right.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, let's move on then with the news.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Thank you, Zaku, again for that special report.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, in other news, and I think that this is pretty cool

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
because there are a lot of fans of this game.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
For anyone with a PSP, Disgaea is heading out to PSP.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
It will be called Afternoon of Darkness.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Oh, so it's like a new game in the series.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Sounds like.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Cool.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
They're putting in a few specific things for the PSP,

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
like a multiplayer mode where you can go against your friends worldwide

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
or share items from your shop.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
It has an exclusive storyline,

11:26.000 --> 11:33.000
and you're trying to become the beauty queen ultimate overlord.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Isn't that your goal in real life, Dark Sakura,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
to become the beauty queen overlord?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
No, my goal is just to be the overlord.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I see.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
I know a lot of people really love Disgaea for its quirky sense of humor,

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
and I played it once.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
It's fun.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I need to sit down and spend more time with it

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
if I could ever tear myself away from those damn MMOs.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, if you're in the U.S.,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
you're in luck because it came out a couple weeks ago.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Sweet.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Definitely worth picking up if you like Disgaea.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
So it's very typical that the Brits are getting in a couple weeks behind.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Sorry, guys.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
We still love you.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
PSP is a region free,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
so if you really, really, really, really, really need your Disgaea right away,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
then there you go.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Anyways, not the big surprise,

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
but Sony has released a custom theme maker for the PlayStation 3,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
much like they did with the PSP after they had theme support for that.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Of course, with the new firmware 2.0 allowing themes,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
you can now create your own.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
So yes, as soon as I get around to it,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
I will create new themes for the PSP website,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
and I'll also create a theme for the PlayStation 3 as well.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
It's about time.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Sheesh.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, whatever.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
I'm too busy playing stuff.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I just renewed the domain not that long ago,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
and I seriously considered just letting it expire,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
but then I remember that there were some people that were e-mailing us

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
saying, I listen to you on the PSP,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
and so I figured, all right, for them we'll keep the site up.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It was a really well done website.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
You don't see many PSP custom done websites.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
I did not renew the domain for OLRE

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
since I never made a site for that.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Damn you.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Whatever.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Who cares?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Let me forgive you.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
Well, also on the PlayStation 3, apparently,

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
if you had your firmware before version 2.0,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
you usually only used to be able to see videos

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
if it was supported in PlayStation 3's format.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Well, now after the 2.0 patch, apparently,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
the PlayStation 3 will now show you thumbnails,

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
running times, and file names for other supported,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
other non-supported formats, such as XVID and DivX.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Now, you can't play them.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
You can just see them,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
but certainly people are taking that one step further and saying,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
well, this is a sign that you're actually going to have support for DivX

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
and XVID in the near future on the PlayStation 3,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
which would certainly be a welcome addition.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Yeah.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
But for right now, you only get thumbnails,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
and you get to know they're there.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
It's just that it will say, you can't watch me,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
So there you have it.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh, poor baby.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
Well, so it's about, you know,

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
we've had this going on for years and years and years and years, you know.

14:08.000 --> 14:14.000
They have a preliminary settlement for the class action suit

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
against Take-Two Interactive for the hot coffee.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh, boy.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Oh, my God, this is years old.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Yeah.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
So basically the terms of the settlement,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
the ones who can benefit from that,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
as if they bought a copy of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
before July 20th, 2005.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
B, were offended by the game's content

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
that used the hot coffee modification.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
That means they would have had, I take...

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I was offended that I had to unlock it.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
I think, no, they said they were upset by the ability

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
to modify and alter the game.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Well, I was upset that you had to have an ability to do it

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
and it wasn't just there.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
So can I have money?

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
And that they would not have bought the game

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
had they known the ability was there

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
and would have returned the game

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
upon learning that the game could be modified

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
if they thought possible.

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
So they have to be able to prove all of this

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
and exchange their copy for a cash settlement

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
of up to $35 with their proof of purchase.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Wow.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
So the...

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
There's still more money than GameStop will give you for it,

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
so hey.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
Pretty much.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
Take-Two is committed to spend 1.025 million

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
on the settlement benefits

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
and their out-of-pocket cost total is 2.75 million.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So now you can...

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
And paying the court cost.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Now, Pete Caruno in our chatroom says,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You can get free money if I say I'm offended by something?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm in.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
You have to have your proof of purchase.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
You have to have the proof of purchase.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Who the hell has a proof of purchase that late?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
I know.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Well, that's how they get around it, you know.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
But I'm going to save it for granted without a fork

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
because I'm going to be highly offended by that someday.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I want to see how many people actually have it.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Highly offended that I didn't get my $35 sooner.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
There's a statement, by the way.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Oh, yes?

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
From Ben Fetter, who's the CEO of Take-Two.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
If the case had continued,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
we believe the court would have agreed that Take-Two

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
was not liable for consumers acting independently

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
to modify their games with third-party hardware and software

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
to access normally inaccessible content.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Nonetheless, we believe it is in the best interest of the company

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
to avoid protracted and costly litigation to prove our case

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
and to finally put this matter behind us.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Gerardimo says, I'm offended by your offense.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
ActDeft, our listener from Mexico who's listening,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
says, I'm suing the guys that made the Spanish training game.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I'm offended and I need money.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Spanish for everyone.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Awesome.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Wow.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
So, I don't know.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I would like to see if they're going to release figures

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
on exactly how many people actually went and got money over this.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I'd be kind of curious to see how many people actually had the proof of purchases

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
and actually went through the song and dance to do this.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I think that would be kind of an interesting figure.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I bet it's less than a couple thousand, if that, honestly.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
I mean, how many people are going to think to do this?

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
Most parents were pissed off and they moved on, right?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Well, you know, there's going to be letters that go out to anyone involved

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
that put their name in with the lawsuit.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I guess that's true.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
Anyways, so there's an interesting drama going on on the website The Consumerist.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
Apparently, a PS3 owner had a problem with their PS3 not working,

17:45.000 --> 17:51.000
so they sent it in to be repaired and I guess, according to them,

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
it was too dusty to be fixed and they considered that because of the dust,

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
it was not covered under the warranty.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
Uh-oh, my Wii is going to be out of warranty as well then

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
with a thick layer of dust on that thing because Mario Galaxy is not out yet.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
They said that it was an act of God or customer abuse.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
That would be under...

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
But it's funny though because there was a follow-up to this as well.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
God has smited my PlayStation 3 with a thick layer of dust.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
The horror, the horror.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
But there was also a follow-up to that.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
I remember reading that that whole statement, of course, is not really true.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
Yes, Sony does. Dust does not void your warranty as well,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
but that was in the later follow-up, I guess.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
But this one lady that was adamant,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
she said that she was the head of the customer service department

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
or something like that in any way that they called.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Oh, and then the other thing too is the guy said,

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
well then hell, take a picture of this dust

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
and let me see what exactly you're talking about if it's so detrimental.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And they said, oh no, we can't take any pictures of that

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
because all the pictures would be owned by Sony

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
and then you can't see them without a subpoena or something like that.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
You have to pay under $50 to repair it out of warranty or something like that.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
Our chat room is lighting up with conversation here.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Odd1 says, it was an act of shitty games.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
Frisbee says, God made dirt and dirt don't hurt.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.000
No, but basically, I was just going to read some sections of this here.

19:25.000 --> 19:31.000
The guy, I kept my 60-gig PS3 in an entertainment center since its purchase.

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
It is known within the PS3 community that the thing is a huge dust magnet.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I took good care of it.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I have ten Blu-ray discs that did not come free of my PS3.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Five games, five controllers.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Why the fuck do you have five controllers?

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
What the hell are you playing?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Maybe specialty controller?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
NBA Live, I'm guessing, because that game supports up to seven.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
Or not NBA Live, NBA 08 or whatever, or 07.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, we get it.

19:55.000 --> 20:02.000
Two 42-inch LCD TVs, one 50-inch Bravia LCD rear production TV air,

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
something like that, via desktop, via laptop, blah, blah, blah.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
Anyways, one day I turn it on, I put a disc in, and it doesn't show up,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
and it won't eject.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Finally, I get to eject, and I try to Blu-ray, and nothing.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
The CD is nothing.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
So I call customer support who originally told me they can't do anything

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
because I don't have the original sales receipt.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
It was a gift.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
I stayed on the phone for hours explaining to them that I have the receipt

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
or I don't have the receipt because it was a gift.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
Finally, the reps said that it was strange that the early reps hadn't let me

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
go through with the exchange.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
If it was a gift, it was a policy not to require receipt, blah, blah, blah.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Anyways, five days later, I have no updates.

20:43.000 --> 20:49.000
Six hours later, after calling them again, I get a call from someone from Nell

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
saying, unfortunately, they have opened the case and taken pictures inside

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
and outside the case, and it was too dirty to be eligible for replacement.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room says, was the owner Pigpen from Peanuts?

21:02.000 --> 21:07.000
And Azurameh says, I hope I pronounced that right, says PlayStation 3 weakness

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
is dust, which makes me think of the end of signs.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
It was water that was their weak point the whole time.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Now it's like dust.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
Anyway, he goes back and forth.

21:19.000 --> 21:29.000
The supervisor, who apparently was a bitch, named Daria Wu, extension 55682,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
basically told him that the picture of the PSP was the property of Sony

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Computer Entertainment of America and that they would have to subpoena

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
pictures in order to see them, and blah, blah, blah.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
And then, of course, at the very end, he says, I don't get it, so I'm using

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
it to be folding at home with their consoles.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
The auto start feature makes it so that it's running almost all the time.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Of course, it's going to be filled with dust.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
Few reps said the reason they couldn't replace it is because it looked like

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
it had been two years worth of dust rather than eight months.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.000
The console hasn't even been out for years, so obviously that's less than

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
a year's worth of dust.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
And, of course, he's all pissed off about it and wasn't going to stay quiet,

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
and that's why everybody ran it.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And then, apparently, like I said, the follow-up, another consumer rep

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
reported, I'm calling pretty much to clarify the PS3's warranty.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
If there's any clause in the warranty that makes it so that the PS3 is too

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
dusty, that the warranty is void.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And the rep said, no, no, and no.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
The only way that it voided is if it were neglected, views dropped,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
or anything like that, modification.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
Like, if you opened it up, if you don't have the sales receipt,

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
power failures, mother nature actually voids the warranty.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
Christ, there's a Bible written on this whole thing, isn't there?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Let me put it this way, why didn't they just fix it?

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
I mean, seriously, their, I don't know, the fucking system obviously

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
hadn't been opened up.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
So what?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
It's dusty.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
You're doing a horrible job of making it a dust magnet.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
All right.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
Well, anyhow, I'm sure we're getting lots of colorful comments on that one.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
If you have something to attribute, if your PlayStation 3 has died due to dust,

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
we'd love to hear from you.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
You know what?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
What?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I think this is a job for dust cap, too.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you'd like to send us an email.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
And Jamie will be opening up the mailbag very soon,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
but we have one more story for you guys before we get to that point.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
And that would be about Warner Brothers.

23:35.000 --> 23:39.000
Warner Brothers has decided to purchase Traveler's Tales

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
and the parent group TT Games.

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
You might know Traveler's Tales from the Lego franchise as well.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
So Warner Brothers just wants to own that shit.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
So there you have it.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
By the way, they'll be putting out Lego Batman very soon,

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
which looks kind of awesome because I love old school Batman.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
So there you have it.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
All right.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Well, like I said, every week you guys send us email to mailbag

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
at orangelaundry.com.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
And the one and only Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
dive on in and read her favorite emails

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
and maybe some of the ones she didn't like either.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Hopefully this is a good week.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I don't know, Dark Sakura.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Was it a good email week?

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
On a scale of 1 to 10, maybe a 6, a 7?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
R.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
It was an R.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Okay.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Well, anyway, I don't know how that works,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
but here goes Dark Sakura with this week's mail.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
The first email comes from Xenocore.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Hey, folks.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
I recently acquired a copy of Oreno Rioni for a PS1.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I love this game.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
However, the emulators I have used with the game

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
don't give me precise control on all analog sticks.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Do you know of the better method to play this game,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
whether emulated or mod chip?

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
I still have the initial launch PS2 and a 60-gigabyte PS3.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
What can I do?

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
I love this game and can't wait to play it.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Well, I'm not really the best person to tell you

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
because I actually have a Japanese PS2

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
and I have several modified...

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Well, not really that they're modified,

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
but I have the PS1 before they removed the back port

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
so that you couldn't use the GameShark thing on it.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
So I really, from experience, could not tell you.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
What game?

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
It's Oreno Rioni.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I had never even heard of that game, I'm sorry to say.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
So I know we love obscure titles, but...

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
Dear Wikipedia.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Yeah.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
No, not that one.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
You know, and I got to say, the PlayStation 1,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
that was kind of the period of my life

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
where I wasn't gaming a whole lot.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
I played a lot of the big games,

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
like Final Fantasy VII and Infinity of the Night,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
but I missed a lot of shit during that period

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
because that's when I was in college

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
and I was actually doing a little bit of work

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
here and there between Puzzle Fighter II.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I was back in the day when I was purchasing

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
HK copies of games,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
importing Ridge Racer 4 and shit like that.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, even Google can't find this.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I'll leave it to the chat room to say something about it, though.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The Flawless Bolt X says,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Funny how someone mentions a PlayStation 1 game

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
when last episode Loki said no one plays them anymore.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
Hey, there's some irony.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
In the U.S.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Sorry we don't have much more for you, my friend.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Hey, we're going to be playing Vibriven.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
True.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Right?

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Hey, but people that play PlayStation...

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Let me play it this way, though.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
If you want to play a PlayStation 1 game right now,

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
you're probably either playing it on a PSP,

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
whether it be modded or not,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
or, you know, you're probably playing it

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
on a PlayStation 1 that you already have.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
You know, I don't think people are out there.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Maybe there's people out there

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
that want to play Final Fantasy VII

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
or something like that to try it out,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
but I don't think there's actually people out there

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
that are like, you know what?

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
I think I'm going to buy a brand new PlayStation 1

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
and some PlayStation 1 games.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
You know, most people don't really go back that far.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Sorry, we weren't much help on that one.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
We're not experts on everything.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Just most things.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
But congratulations for stumping the host.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Dude, I couldn't...

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Here's some free Rice-A-Roni.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
I couldn't find anything about that game.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Anyway, we get an e-mail from Thomas that says

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
O-L-R equals win.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Well, thank you, Thomas.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
And we get one from Robert N.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
It says, I'm not sure if tonight's show

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
includes plans on discussing the harmonics iPod game phase.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Hey, you're psycho.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
I mean, psychic.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Maybe psycho, too.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Freudian slip.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
How dare you insult the listeners.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
You know what, whatever.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
But I did go ahead and purchase that on iTunes Store.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I have only two complaints,

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
which are issues with all iPods games so far.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
First of all, it uses a lot of battery power while playing.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
Secondly, any session between syncing the iPod with your computer with iTunes

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
in which phase is played even once

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
appears to clear out your play counts for all podcasts and songs,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
which isn't even an issue if you don't care about play counts,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
but it could be problematic for podcasts.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
It's playing phase to a podcast.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Wow, that might be interesting.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Or not.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Otherwise, the game is a lot of fun, simple, but addictive.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
Most of it uses the back, select, and forward buttons

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
tapped to the beat of the music,

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
following on-screen scrolling options

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
with a great artistic style surrounding it.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
A few parts use the scroll wheel to follow a line for bonus points,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
which build up stars needed to pass checkpoints.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
It usually works equally as well with songs you add to the playlist in iTunes

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
as it does with its built-in songs,

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
including new songs by Freezepop, Ben Camaro, among others.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
Sweet.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Highly recommended for fans of music games.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
Sounds kind of fun.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
I need to check that out still on my iPod, which I will at some point.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I didn't realize it came with some free songs.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
That I did not know.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Freezepop is cool.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Very cool.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
J-Rod.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I'm just glad that we missed that concert last week.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
I bought my PS3 from Kmart,

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
and now they stopped selling Blu-ray discs to those damn traders.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
This is the person with the really cool signature

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
that says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
home of Never Ending Salads.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
And breadsticks.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Don't forget breadsticks.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
I don't want any more salad.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
It's going to be more salad for you.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Oh, never mind.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I was going to say something, but I lost.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
My train derailed.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
My train of thought.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
The salad destroyed your train.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Because I started thinking about the Olive Garden,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
and the Olive Garden is awesome.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Well, we have a long one.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Hurray for long emails.

29:18.000 --> 29:24.000
It says this is actually being sent to us by,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
well, if I just say Rick,

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
because he didn't put a nickname in there,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
but it seems like he's from the UK.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
That's cool.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Hi, guys.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Let me know if you get the reference.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Okay.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
It started with GameSpot,

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
and then it expanded to IGN.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Then I found this link to OLR on a random podcast site.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
Now my crack-like habit of listening to gaming podcasts

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
creeps into my working day.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
Yours being the one I look forward to the most.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Oh, thank you.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Oh, thank you.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Cheerio.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Cheerio.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Now as my girlfriend is sleeping,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I must wait till tomorrow to download

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
and heat up my OLR fix on the spoon,

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
then inject it into my ears while striving to work

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
or pretending to concentrate on my PC screen at my desk,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
stifling a few good laughs, I might add.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
This guy is hardcore.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
I love it.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Rad.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
I own a Wii.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Now, I know it may not seem as a hardcore system,

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
but I love it.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I have owned every incarnation of Nintendo's system

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
and enjoyed them all.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Yes, even the N64 Dark was cool apart from the last level.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
And I have never had a hardware failure with any of them

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
apart from when I made Smoke come out of the back

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
of my Super NES after playing Desert Strike for 24 hours solid.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Wow.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Hardcore.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
I don't know if I'd say hardcore more so fanboy.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
It's all right.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
It's not a crime.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
I recently bought a nice 32-inch Panasonic LCD TV,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
and I was excited by the thought of mating my Wii

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
with my new tele.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
Yes, I'm from England.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
See, I told you.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
To make sweet love and produce a little bundle of gaming joy.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
To my confusion, I seemed to have funny little dots

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
all over the screen.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Then I played Resident Evil 4.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I was horrified to see it looked like a crusty pile

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
of burst hemorrhoids.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
That's beautiful.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Ew.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
After frantically searching the internet,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
I found that the problem was with the video card

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
on the Wii overheating.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I rang the nice people in Nintendo and sent it away.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And after two weeks, they returned it back to me all fixed.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Now, I am happy to say it all looks fab.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Is this a common fault?

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
I have never heard any of this on any podcast before.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
The 360 has its own podcast named

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
after its notorious issues.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Anyway, keep up the good work.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I would love to hear my email on your show,

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
as I am a big fan and you always seem to have fun.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
And you guys are very knowledgeable and,

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
more importantly, impartial.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Stay independent.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
I love how he says that after a previous listener stumped us.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
That's all right.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.000
Note to Loki and Sky.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
Every time Dark Soccer reads all the emails and says,

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
you should do the same.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
My response, though, back to that first one

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
about the PlayStation game.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
I played on the Dreamcast.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
It came out on the Dreamcast.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
It's a lot easier to get it to play on the Dreamcast.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Yes.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
What the?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
You found?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Why is it making that noise?

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Oh, because I forgot to hit stop earlier

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
and it was playing the Portal song from earlier.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
But anyway, I did find that...

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Sorry, the show.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
The show was a lie.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
No, but what it was is that apparently

32:11.000 --> 32:14.000
we found some information on the game on IGN.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Apparently it was a cooking simulator

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
and it was the first DualShock enhanced cooking simulator on the market.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
No, it wasn't on the Dreamcast.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
It just came out the same day as the Dreamcast.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
But they did have a demo in the US.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Whatever.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
On the PlayStation Underground.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
There you have it.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
So it was a cooking game.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Maybe that's why they thought you would know

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
because you are a Cooking Mama fan extraordinaire.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
So maybe this is one of those classic games

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
you need to go back and find.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
I've been over Cooking Mama for about a month now, you know.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Dude, the sequel's out.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I know. I have to get it.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Anyway, I wanted to say...

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
I want to make a cake.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
I wanted to say to our hardcore fan overseas

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
that you are not the first person to have an exploding Wii.

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
That particular issue, I think, is the first time I've heard of that.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
Certainly nobody else I've ever heard compares it to hemorrhoid, whatever.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
That was kind of weird.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
But, you know, every system is going to have some that break.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
You know, there's just some faulty stuff on the assembly line.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Anything that comes off an assembly line

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
is going to have a fault once in a while.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
That game Counter Force kind of looked like a bursting hemorrhoid,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
but, you know, that's just that game, I guess.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
So...

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
But the problem was, at least with the Xbox 360,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
that Red Rings of Death was very prevalent.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
A lot of people had that issue,

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
and that's why it's become almost like a pop culture gag

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
within the gaming scene.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
And you do have...

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I didn't know there was a podcast called Red Rings of Death,

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
but I'm somehow not surprised.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
I mean, that's why it's become such a phenomenon

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
and why Microsoft had to specifically extend the warranty.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
To Nintendo's credit, they've managed to kind of squelch

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
a lot of the people complaining about this

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
because apparently their customer service is very good.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
And as you say, they got your Wii back to you

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
in a couple weeks there, just brand spanking new,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
and I'm imagining they didn't charge you anything for it, so...

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
And they also take out hits on people that complain.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
Yes.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Nintendo has their own ninja task force.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
If you dare talk smack about Reggie,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
those guys will come to your door and say,

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
Wii would like to play with guns.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
And your head.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
So there's more.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
More.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Can I finish the email?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
More.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Thank you.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Spelled M-O-A-R.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
P.S.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Where the fuck is my strategy game for the Wii?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Surely it's perfect for Command & Conquer.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
I would even settle for Red Alert Graphics.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
Is that asking too much?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Yes.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
Okay, then Tiberium Wars?

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Okay.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Are there any strategy games bound for the Wii?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Battle Advance Wars?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Battalion Wars 2, maybe.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
And then Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Nice.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
But Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, unfortunately,

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
is apparently very much like the last game that came out on the GameCube,

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
almost exactly the same.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
But we like Fire Emblem.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
I just hate playing strategy games myself.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Oh, and a question for me.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Did you ever play Cannon Fodder?

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
This is an awesome game, also should be remade for the Wii.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
War has never been so much fun, and so on.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
I know of it.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I actually have not played it.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
That sounds familiar.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
I've never played it either.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
Yet another game stumping the panel here at Orange Line.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
No, I think I did play it, but I just...

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
We've talked about Cannon Fodder on the show before.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I thought, hmm?

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
Back in a while, but I do believe that we have.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
As in our chat room, Cannon Fodder was good, General Chaos was better.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
See, when in doubt, when we're stumped, we always have the chat room

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
and plenty of people there to rely on their gaming knowledge as well.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
There's one more last bit to this email.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Wow, this goes on forever.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Bye.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
It's capitalized, so I'd say it that way.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
All right.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Goodbye.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Last email.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Dearest OLR.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Oh, well, that's so sweet of you.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
I know.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
A journey of dreams and a new samba de amigo coming to Wii

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
and Rez coming to Xbox Live Arcade, which I think was Sega.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
It seems Sega is what?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
They published it.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah, they published it, yeah.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
It seems Sega is giving gamers a chance to play some of their better games

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
that were probably missed by most people.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Ow.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Some of those that should have been missed.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Should have remained missed, yes.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
If this is the case, I was wondering what Sega games you would like to see remade

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
slash sequelized slash playable again.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Originally, I would love to see Space Channel 5 on Wii,

36:20.000 --> 36:23.000
and it's one of the few games I would like to play by shaking the Wii mode around,

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
but only if Space Michael still has a part in it.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
You took my answer, Jerardimo.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
You took my answer, Jerardimo, you jerk.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
That's exactly what I would have said to Space Channel 5.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.000
Now what am I going to say?

36:34.000 --> 36:35.000
Space Channel 5, too.

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
No, for real, because the Space Michael levels are so much better.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I love the Pudding Guitar battle.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
That's my favorite.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
Yeah, but the Space Michael levels are versus battles

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
where each side does different dances from the different videos.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
They even do the freaking thriller dance, and I think that's fantastic.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
How about another Crazy Taxi game, but like a good one, not a cheap knockoff.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Crazy Taxi kind of jumped the shark because there was sequel after sequel.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
How about a remade really good Crazy Taxi

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
that has more than just the offspring as the music?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
They had bad religion.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Oh, sorry.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Jet Set Radio.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Yeah.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Good answer.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
That's another thing that we need is definitely another Jet Set Radio

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
because I freaking love that game.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Odd One agrees with that, Jet Set Radio.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.000
Doing the graffiti with the Wiimote would be awesome in the chat room there.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
GS68 says...

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Well, because you'd have to do it in that pattern, right?

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
GS68 says Space Harrier and fuck Planet Harrier.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Planet Harrier, okay.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
I love Space Harrier, but the thing is that I could not imagine

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Space Harrier updated.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
The best version, now...

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
They did Space Harrier for the Sega Aegis 2900, didn't they?

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
Yeah, because I think I have that one, but I love playing, actually.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
My favorite thing to play Space Harrier on at home is the 32X

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
because it is the arcade version.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
You can even reset some of the modes in that

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
to where it brings up all the arcade attract stuff.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
I got one for you that's perfect for Xbox Live, Fantasy Zone.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Oh, hell yeah.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
They probably need to put out Fantasy Zone.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Except, I think that would be kind of...

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
You would have to do it, though, classic controller only, I think.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Or, how about...

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
You know what game we haven't seen an incarnation of in a long time is Alex Kidd.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Bring me some Alex Kidd.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
You know what's actually going to be coming out here pretty soon in January, I think,

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
is that Sega Bass Fishing.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Sounds like fun.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Well, let's remember the one on the Dreamcast with the fishing rod.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Yeah, with the rod caliber.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Yeah, that game gave us rod caliber.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Good times.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I know that I've mentioned this on the show a bunch of times,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
but you could play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod, and it was really cool.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
You know, you can actually play that Soul Calibur Legends.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
They have that fishing rod that comes with Hooked, real motion fishing.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Have you tried it?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
No, I have not tried that game because...

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
Well, one, I don't want to buy Hooked because it's a fishing game.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
I don't fish.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I don't find fishing fun.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
Simulating fishing, I think, would be even less fun.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
Yeah.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
I don't know.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
Anyways, any more emails?

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
We actually got one from RobWithTwoBees

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
that's a link to a story about a boy who hired a hitman

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
to kill his parents for PlayStation punishment.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
That's funny.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
A boy, these parents told their son they couldn't play his PlayStation

39:33.000 --> 39:38.000
for poor grades and bad behavior, and the son tried to hire a hitman.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
Oh my god! What's this world coming to?

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
These people in Maryland,

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
Shannon and Joey Troiano from Maryland

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
punished their son Cory by confiscating their PlayStation

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
and hiding it and banned him from watching TV.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
So he tried to hire a hitman.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
And his mom actually set him up for a sting.

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
God, that kid's retarded. What in the hell is wrong with this family?

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000
He promised that he would give him his stepfather's new pickup

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
as payment for killing his parents.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And then he was arrested.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And somebody was actually going to kill these people over a pickup?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
No, it was... What's this world coming to?

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Maybe it was a really nice pickup.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
I somehow doubt that. That's crazy talk.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Wow. Wow. And she's quoted as saying,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
I miss him being at home, and I miss us joking around and kidding around,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
but in the same breath, I don't know what this kid will do

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
because that's not my son.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
That can't be my little boy sitting there.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Wow.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
It said that his behavior got worse ever since his father left.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
It's like Rosemary's Baby or the omen or something crazy there.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Wow.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Any more emails to depress us?

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
It said he dropped out of school and stole 45 bucks.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Wow. This guy sounds like a real winner.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah, that's it.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
That's it for emails.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
If you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Meanwhile, more news.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
News.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Anyways, so some pretty cool stuff.

41:12.000 --> 41:18.000
According to Valve, they're adding the Orange Box games

41:18.000 --> 41:21.000
to the Source Software Development Kit.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
So that means that you guys can go out there

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
and make some cool new levels and mods and whatnot

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
for Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and all sorts of fun stuff.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Let's see here.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
God, we're going to see shitloads of portal mods.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
Included in the Software Development Kit

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
are the Hammer World Editor,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
which provides the capability of creating custom levels

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
for Source Engine-based games,

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
Valve's custom Face Poser tool that allows users

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
to produce choreographed sequences in the Source Engine,

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
a Model Viewer that allows artists

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
to preview models and animations quickly,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
a Source Code that allows mod makers

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
to create their own games based off of Half-Life 2

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
or Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
and all the tools required to make, build custom textures

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
and models for Source Engine games.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
So, that's a whole lot of cool stuff.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
And I've actually seen, there were some custom maps out there,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
or mods or something like that, with a portal

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
that actually had some gravity modifiers in there as well,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
like different sections of the map had different gravity and whatnot.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
So that'd be kind of cool.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Wow, all right.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Well, I definitely, you know, I'm looking forward to seeing

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
some of the mods you're going to do,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
and I would say it's only a matter of time

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
before we get a mod for Portal,

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
where the cake will, in fact, be truth.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Actually...

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
What?

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
And people are saying these are Easter eggs,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
but I think they're more in-game glitches.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
You can actually get to their room at the end of the credits

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
where the cake is.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Hmm. Interesting.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Yeah.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Hacks, mad hacks, game genies.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
No, there's ways, if you put in the code

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
where you can shoot portals anywhere on any surface,

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
you can actually get it to where you can clip through the walls sometimes.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Yeah.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
But there's also, I think it is kind of cool

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
that the whole credit sequence,

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
when you're going through where the pipes are,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
you can actually...

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
There is a glitch where you can go into that area

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
because it is fully rendered and in the game.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Well, there's been a healthy donation

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
of some SimCity made by EA.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
You've probably heard of the One Laptop Per Child program.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
This is something where, like,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
they were going to actually put laptops in classrooms

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
in other countries for children in the classroom.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
Well, EA has actually donated the original version of SimCity

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
to be pre-installed on all machines.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
So, kind of interesting, a very classic game, SimCity.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
It kind of teaches you something about city management

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
and certainly uses logic and a lot of other skills in the game.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
So there you have it.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Being donated by Electronic Arts

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
for every one of those $100 laptops.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
That's pretty cool.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
Donations are cool, but seriously,

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
couldn't they have pwned in the money for SimCity 2000?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
No, I'm just kidding.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
The classic is way better.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
I hate SimCity 2000.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Well, it's also the laptop's pretty old.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
I mean, well, not $100.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
They're 100 bucks. Hello.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
The processor in it is not exactly powerful and stuff, so...

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Okay, look, as long as they play Oregon Trail,

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
what else do you need?

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
That's what kids need in this school.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Exactly. That should have been Oregon Trail.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
So then they would need a Mac.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
Or just an Apple IIe with the green monitor.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Apple IIe.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Those things for the shit.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
And I want all these kids to learn Logo.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Oh.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
Pen down.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Forward 20.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Right 90.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Forward 20.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Right 90.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
Hey, guess what?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Atari 2600 News.

44:46.000 --> 44:53.000
The Atari 2600 has been inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
at the Strong National Museum of Play.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
You know what the other two things that were inducted were along with it?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Raggedy Ann.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
No, Raggedy Andy.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Sorry.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
And the kite.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
Like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but with toys.

45:09.000 --> 45:16.000
The museum's curator has said that the Atari system paved the way for today's gaming consoles

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
and quote mesmerized a generation with games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Frogger.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
The kite.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
So that's pretty cool.

45:26.000 --> 45:37.000
Yeah, apparently it's also in there with the teddy bear roller skates and Mr. Potato Head.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Is Light Bright in the Toy Hall of Fame?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I don't know, but it should be, dammit.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
It should be, absolutely.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.000
And before they made them crappy, I want the Light Brights that could like set on fire

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
if you played Light Bright for too long.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Because Light Bright is the greatest toy of all time.

45:49.000 --> 45:58.000
And by the way, by the way, my classic computer love goes towards the Texas Instruments computer.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
I want a Light Bright.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Let's make that happen.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I want a Light Bright so we can put O.L.R.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
I had a Light Bright.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
Did I tell you?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I swear to God we're going to like the flea market soon.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
But the thing is that my peers would always get mad at me because I would have them buy

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
me extra dots and I would make my own pictures.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
I would never use the things that came with them.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
I made my own pictures.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
I made patterns.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
Patterns are my thing.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
But you know what I found?

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
At a yard sale like a year ago, I found Transformers Light Bright patterns.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
That's awesome.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
So I kept them.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
I bought them.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
I totally want a Light Bright.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Can't you imagine putting a Light Bright here on the shelf?

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Guys, listeners, find us a Light Bright.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
We implore.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
eBay?

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I swear to God I'm going to yard sales.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
I'm going to eBay right now.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Please do.

46:39.000 --> 46:45.200
Anyways, in case you've been living under a rock, the Writers Guild of America is striking

46:45.200 --> 46:46.200
right now.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.200
I mean, it's just a surprise.

46:49.200 --> 46:56.200
Anyways, so what that means is a lot of movie productions have halted and one of those movies

46:56.200 --> 47:04.380
that's kind of been put on the brakes, I guess, Wolfenstein and Sci-Fi Wire apparently is

47:04.380 --> 47:11.040
reporting that the script is almost done, but everything as far as the production date

47:11.040 --> 47:16.280
and that kind of thing won't be decided until after all of this is over.

47:16.280 --> 47:25.180
And of course, you know, Roger Avery fully supports the strike and yeah.

47:25.180 --> 47:31.000
So darn, I guess we have to wait for a Wolfenstein movie.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Just a thought.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.400
It's probably going to suck.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.400
So take your time.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.400
It's alright.

47:36.400 --> 47:40.800
And if the movie sucks, I will go on strike from doing this program.

47:40.800 --> 47:44.800
There was somebody commented, I want to say this on Any Cool News or something like that,

47:44.800 --> 47:49.960
and I'm sure people have made the same kind of comments, that TV watchers and movie watchers

47:49.960 --> 47:54.360
should have their own guild and strike when there's like crappy movies.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.360
Refuse to watch them.

47:55.360 --> 47:59.280
Why the hell does a light bright have $52 shipping on it?

47:59.280 --> 48:00.280
Christ.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.280
Sorry.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.520
That's a light truck.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.000
And then the ones, I found a light bright for 25 bucks.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
Well, I think the whole Rider Strike thing does kind of, I mean, it's unfortunate.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.960
Well, the reason why it has $52 shipping is probably because the sale price, if it's cheap

48:14.960 --> 48:19.800
enough, they don't have to pay as much of an eBay tax, I guess, on that thing or the,

48:19.800 --> 48:24.160
you know, eBay doesn't get as big of a portion and then that way they can just make it all

48:24.160 --> 48:25.360
up in shipping.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.240
That's cheap.

48:27.240 --> 48:28.240
That's working the system.

48:28.240 --> 48:31.520
They need to have one with a buy it now on here.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.520
Alright.

48:32.520 --> 48:37.840
And I would like to point out that Marissa in our chat room says light bright has become

48:37.840 --> 48:40.120
modern with light bright flat screen.

48:40.120 --> 48:43.680
Yeah, and I want an old one, like the one I had from 1982.

48:43.680 --> 48:47.880
Can you find an Etch A Sketch while you're at it?

48:47.880 --> 48:50.440
Okay, I found a 1986 light bright refill pack.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.440
Rad.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.720
We might have to get that so we get plenty of orange pegs.

48:53.720 --> 48:57.800
Anyhow, something else from the 80s that is awesome is The Last Starfighter.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.040
Yes.

48:59.040 --> 49:02.840
And remember how The Last Starfighter had like a video game kind of in it, but it was

49:02.840 --> 49:03.840
never actually a game?

49:03.840 --> 49:06.720
It was supposed to be a game, but it wasn't.

49:06.720 --> 49:13.000
Well, what happened is that this guy actually put together a copy of the Starfighter game

49:13.000 --> 49:15.680
and actually put it in the cabinet.

49:15.680 --> 49:19.680
Atari had made this full final version of the game, but they never actually put it out.

49:19.680 --> 49:25.800
But thanks to the love and hardcoreness, for lack of a better term, of this guy, he can

49:25.800 --> 49:27.160
now play Starfighter in his house.

49:27.160 --> 49:29.600
I mean, this comes complete with like the levers and everything.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.120
This isn't just in any old cabinet.

49:31.120 --> 49:34.480
This isn't like an actual cabinet like the one from the movie.

49:34.480 --> 49:44.000
If you want to see this for yourself, Roguesynapse.com, let me spell that for you guys, R-O-G-U-E-S-Y-N-A-P-S-E.com.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.840
You found a virtual light bright?

49:45.840 --> 49:47.520
One of our chatters linked it.

49:47.520 --> 49:48.520
That's just not as cool.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.520
I'm sorry to say.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.800
I appreciate the effort.

49:51.800 --> 49:52.800
So that's pretty cool.

49:52.800 --> 49:57.120
So if you want to play Starfighter for yourself, head on over because they have a download

49:57.120 --> 50:02.140
link on that page, Roguesynapse.com.

50:02.140 --> 50:03.640
So moving on with the gaming news.

50:03.640 --> 50:06.360
Dude, I was playing light bright, Rob.

50:06.360 --> 50:07.360
Sorry.

50:07.360 --> 50:08.360
Sorry.

50:08.360 --> 50:11.760
Anyhoo, moving on.

50:11.760 --> 50:18.560
For our anime fans in the chat room, there is a Persona 3 anime to be out in January.

50:18.560 --> 50:24.680
Being put out by Aniplex's A-1 Pictures, they are adapting it for a...

50:24.680 --> 50:30.320
It's actually going to be called Persona Trinity Soul in January 2008, which is set a decade

50:30.320 --> 50:39.340
after the game and will center around three brothers in a city where the dead have turned

50:39.340 --> 50:40.960
their skins inside out.

50:40.960 --> 50:41.960
Ew.

50:41.960 --> 50:42.960
Yeah.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.080
I'll probably watch it.

50:44.080 --> 50:45.080
That sounds really cool.

50:45.080 --> 50:48.160
Is that kind of like that guy in PBS?

50:48.160 --> 50:49.400
I don't think so.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.920
There's a lot of people that love their Persona, so this is, I'm sure, good news to a lot of

50:52.920 --> 50:55.360
the fans of Persona 3.

50:55.360 --> 50:57.600
I think so.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.600
Inside out, man.

50:59.600 --> 51:00.600
Anyways.

51:00.600 --> 51:10.080
So, speaking of eBay earlier, if you're desperate for some celebrity memorabilia, eBay of course

51:10.080 --> 51:16.600
is the place to find it, and since this is vaguely game-related, Gary Coleman is selling

51:16.600 --> 51:17.600
his GameCube.

51:17.600 --> 51:25.800
Yes, times are pretty hard for old Gary, and of course he is signing his GameCube as well

51:25.800 --> 51:32.320
as the games coming with it, which if I remember correctly there was one from Robots, the movie

51:32.320 --> 51:34.840
of the game, and some other crap in there.

51:34.840 --> 51:38.960
So let's see here.

51:38.960 --> 51:46.040
So if you're interested in it, only $510 right now is the going price for it.

51:46.040 --> 51:51.720
Let's see, it includes Mortal Kombat Deception, Super Smash Brothers Melee, Mario Kart Double

51:51.720 --> 51:58.960
Dash, Sonic 2, Adventure Battle, and Sonic Gems Collection.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.760
Nice.

52:00.760 --> 52:07.680
And Gary Coleman has signed each one of those things, so now you can own a piece of Gary.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.160
A little itty bitty piece.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.720
He's welcome to keep it.

52:10.720 --> 52:15.120
Former mayoral candidate, or I mean, gubernatorial candidate here in California.

52:15.120 --> 52:17.720
You might remember when Gary Coleman ran for governor, remember?

52:17.720 --> 52:19.480
He didn't even freakin' make the top ten.

52:19.480 --> 52:20.480
I know.

52:20.480 --> 52:25.680
Although, that one porn star did, she was in the top ten, the Mary Carey or whatever

52:25.680 --> 52:26.680
she was.

52:26.680 --> 52:30.160
Hey, I totally supported her because- Wasn't she like promising like a blowjob for everyone

52:30.160 --> 52:32.160
that voted for her?

52:32.160 --> 52:33.160
Probably.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.160
That's my vote.

52:34.160 --> 52:38.240
I would like to point out that, and I apologize if I'm butchering this name in our chat room,

52:38.240 --> 52:42.520
Necro Arca in our chat room linked us to a Lite Brite Cube.

52:42.520 --> 52:45.480
It's a modern version of the Lite Brite that's available on Amazon.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.160
It's actually like four sides to it.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.560
I know a cube has six sides, but the top and bottom don't actually do anything.

52:50.560 --> 52:52.840
But that's kind of neat because you can put a pattern on every side.

52:52.840 --> 52:53.840
That is pretty cool.

52:53.840 --> 52:55.520
But I want an old school one, yo.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.880
15 bucks for that.

52:56.880 --> 52:57.880
No way.

52:57.880 --> 52:58.880
I want an old, old one.

52:58.880 --> 52:59.880
Yeah, I want an old school one.

52:59.880 --> 53:02.080
Like the kind that gets so hot that you can't touch it.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.080
I know.

53:03.080 --> 53:04.640
Yeah, but you know what you can do with that?

53:04.640 --> 53:06.680
Lite Brite companion cube.

53:06.680 --> 53:07.680
Yes.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.680
Good time.

53:09.680 --> 53:12.840
You know what I'm going to do as soon as I learn how to sew?

53:12.840 --> 53:15.960
I'm going to make myself a weighted companion cube purse.

53:15.960 --> 53:19.600
People are crazy about their weighted companion cube.

53:19.600 --> 53:25.040
I still have not played Portal, so these jokes go over my head.

53:25.040 --> 53:29.120
But this joke I get, and I think it's hilarious, because one of the first games I ever remember

53:29.120 --> 53:32.560
playing on the Commodore 64 was Zork.

53:32.560 --> 53:38.800
And Zork has apparently been smooshed with Pac-Man to create this homegrown game, Packed

53:38.800 --> 53:45.040
TXT, and it's available for play at pac-txt.com.

53:45.040 --> 53:47.000
It's Pac-Man meets Zork.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.640
And yes, it's as stupid as it sounds.

53:49.640 --> 53:52.480
You actually play Pac-Man, but it's in Zork format.

53:52.480 --> 53:56.920
In other words, you go, eat, and it says, you have eaten another glowing dot, and you

53:56.920 --> 53:57.920
type forward.

53:57.920 --> 54:00.360
You have moved forward.

54:00.360 --> 54:06.540
So stupid, it's hilarious, but I'm sure it will get old in about five minutes.

54:06.540 --> 54:07.880
There you have it.

54:07.880 --> 54:14.880
Anyhow, if you would like to give us a call, our Skype line is now open for business, 1-877-game-over.

54:14.880 --> 54:21.880
I doubt we'll have anything as exciting as the Nintendo World Store call from earlier,

54:21.880 --> 54:25.000
and Zaku actually sounding not high this week.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.280
But who knows?

54:27.280 --> 54:28.640
I'm sure our folks will try.

54:28.640 --> 54:31.920
So meanwhile, while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a delay, let's

54:31.920 --> 54:36.520
see if there's any last minute stories from here in chat, or here in studio.

54:36.520 --> 54:38.240
Hey, I'm not a chat.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.240
I'm a me.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.240
Sorry.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
My bad.

54:41.240 --> 54:49.480
Here's an interesting one, Eiji Onomura was interviewed in the last issue of Official

54:49.480 --> 54:55.240
Nintendo Magazine, of course that's in the UK, talking about what his interests are in

54:55.240 --> 54:58.200
the Legend of Zelda series and how he'd like to continue it.

54:58.200 --> 55:02.560
One thing he's interested in doing is a 3D remake of A Link to the Past, which would

55:02.560 --> 55:03.560
be fucking awesome.

55:03.560 --> 55:04.560
So I hope they do that.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.560
That would be fucking awesome.

55:05.560 --> 55:09.200
And do it in the Wind Waker Engine, none of this fucking Twilight Princess shit.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.400
Alright, we're getting a phone call.

55:10.400 --> 55:11.400
Let's go take it.

55:11.400 --> 55:12.400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

55:12.400 --> 55:13.400
Who's this?

55:13.400 --> 55:14.400
Oh my god, I'm on.

55:14.400 --> 55:17.240
This is Odd1 from the chat room.

55:17.240 --> 55:19.760
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

55:19.760 --> 55:20.760
Wow.

55:20.760 --> 55:21.760
Odd1.

55:21.760 --> 55:22.760
Odd1.

55:22.760 --> 55:23.760
O-D-D-O-N-E.

55:23.760 --> 55:24.760
Yeah.

55:24.760 --> 55:25.760
You made it.

55:25.760 --> 55:26.760
You're a first time live listener tonight, right?

55:26.760 --> 55:30.960
Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for years while I was working.

55:30.960 --> 55:36.280
You guys got me through some really tough, long hours, and I'm so grateful to you guys.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.280
Wow.

55:37.280 --> 55:38.280
I just want to say thanks.

55:38.280 --> 55:39.280
Thank you.

55:39.280 --> 55:43.880
It's words like that that seriously keep us motivated, because we do this.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.960
We don't make any money off of it, unlike some of the other podcasts out there that

55:46.960 --> 55:50.320
are just out there to support their magazines and websites and stuff.

55:50.320 --> 55:51.920
So thank you very much.

55:51.920 --> 55:52.920
That's very flattering.

55:52.920 --> 55:53.920
I do this for Monopoly money.

55:53.920 --> 55:54.920
Oh, sorry.

55:54.920 --> 55:56.920
I do this for Monopoly money.

55:56.920 --> 56:00.680
Yeah, you take beer for the love, and it shows.

56:00.680 --> 56:01.680
That's true.

56:01.680 --> 56:02.680
Dark Soccer gets free beer out of this.

56:02.680 --> 56:03.680
I get free beer.

56:03.680 --> 56:07.240
So when we have extra beer, Dark Soccer comes to my house and drinks all my beer.

56:07.240 --> 56:10.360
Anyway, what's on your mind, Audwin?

56:10.360 --> 56:13.160
Honestly, I didn't think I'd get through.

56:13.160 --> 56:14.160
I don't have much on my mind.

56:14.160 --> 56:18.560
I just wanted to say thanks, and now that I get free time, I'm going to be listening

56:18.560 --> 56:20.160
live every week.

56:20.160 --> 56:23.200
Seriously, you guys are just the best.

56:23.200 --> 56:24.200
You're welcome.

56:24.200 --> 56:25.200
Thank you so much.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.200
Well, then tell us about your gaming week real quick.

56:26.200 --> 56:27.200
We'll ask you questions.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.200
Oh, my God.

56:28.200 --> 56:29.200
How is your gaming week?

56:29.200 --> 56:31.200
What games have you been playing?

56:31.200 --> 56:35.000
Man, all I got here is a GameCube right now.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.280
Is it Gary Coleman's GameCube?

56:38.280 --> 56:41.880
It's no good at all.

56:41.880 --> 56:44.600
Okay, well, the GameCube's not horrible.

56:44.600 --> 56:48.560
I'm assuming it's a money thing, which is why you don't have the next-gen systems.

56:48.560 --> 56:52.520
It's a money thing.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.160
It's a stolen system thing.

56:55.160 --> 56:56.760
I don't even want to go into it.

56:56.760 --> 57:01.480
All right, well, let's say you had $400 in your pocket right now, enough to buy any of

57:01.480 --> 57:02.500
the next-gen systems.

57:02.500 --> 57:04.500
Which one would you buy and why?

57:04.500 --> 57:11.440
You know, I'd probably buy a Wii and about 20 million of those Wii points because, especially

57:11.440 --> 57:15.520
with the Neo Geo, the Virtual Console is just hot.

57:15.520 --> 57:17.160
I need that in my life.

57:17.160 --> 57:18.160
It is hot.

57:18.160 --> 57:22.120
Like, seriously, my Wii wasn't even plugged in for about three weeks.

57:22.120 --> 57:24.920
And I finally went and plugged it back in today because I wanted to check out some of

57:24.920 --> 57:28.160
the new stuff like the Check Me Out channel and Mario 3.

57:28.160 --> 57:32.200
And I went back on, and I saw that Simon's Quest was on Virtual Console, and I completely

57:32.200 --> 57:33.200
forgot about it.

57:33.200 --> 57:36.440
And when I saw it, I seriously, I think I got a semi.

57:36.440 --> 57:39.480
Like, that game is so awesome.

57:39.480 --> 57:42.320
Even with the shitty translation, it's fun.

57:42.320 --> 57:44.840
What a terrible night to have a curse.

57:44.840 --> 57:45.840
That game.

57:45.840 --> 57:46.840
The game is awesome.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.520
Seriously, one of the best soundtracks of all time.

57:49.520 --> 57:52.960
So yeah, just lots of choice.

57:52.960 --> 57:56.360
And I know people say, just play them in emulators for free and blah, blah, blah.

57:56.360 --> 57:57.360
But I don't know.

57:57.360 --> 58:01.080
There's something rewarding about having the authentic experience because you know Nintendo,

58:01.080 --> 58:05.560
you know, it's coming from the official source, and the fact that I can play it on my HDTV,

58:05.560 --> 58:06.560
like in the old school Nintendo.

58:06.560 --> 58:07.560
I don't know.

58:07.560 --> 58:10.600
There's something about that that for whatever reason, maybe I'm just lazy and don't want

58:10.600 --> 58:14.760
to hook up the whole like Dreamcast and burn the CD or whatever.

58:14.760 --> 58:19.320
There's something about it that just, I don't know, is worth the five bucks.

58:19.320 --> 58:23.960
Well I mean, and also, you know, I associate my computer with work.

58:23.960 --> 58:28.880
I'll play on it, but you know, when I want to relax, I get on my couch and turn on my

58:28.880 --> 58:29.880
TV.

58:29.880 --> 58:30.880
That's a good point.

58:30.880 --> 58:31.880
That's a good point.

58:31.880 --> 58:35.480
Like I don't like to play games on the computer that were originally designed for the console.

58:35.480 --> 58:38.720
Something like World of Warcraft or PC develop games, I have no problem playing those on

58:38.720 --> 58:39.720
the PC.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.940
Why do you think I have so many video game systems?

58:42.940 --> 58:44.440
So you can sit on the couch.

58:44.440 --> 58:50.880
So I can sit on my couch and use my original controller and play the game.

58:50.880 --> 58:52.880
There you have it.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.880
Exactly.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.960
Alright, well I'm going to let you go.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.520
Thank you so much for taking my call.

58:57.520 --> 58:58.880
No problem Odd1.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.040
It's very nice to hear such enthusiasm.

59:01.040 --> 59:02.320
It makes us even more excited.

59:02.320 --> 59:03.440
So thank you Odd1 for your call.

59:03.440 --> 59:04.440
We appreciate it.

59:04.440 --> 59:05.440
Have a good one.

59:05.440 --> 59:06.440
Bye.

59:06.440 --> 59:07.440
Bye bye.

59:07.440 --> 59:10.840
He had just had so much enthusiasm, like was generally happy to be on the show.

59:10.840 --> 59:11.840
I love that.

59:11.840 --> 59:12.840
So great.

59:12.840 --> 59:13.840
Thank you so much.

59:13.840 --> 59:14.840
Let's go to another call.

59:14.840 --> 59:15.840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

59:15.840 --> 59:16.840
Who's this?

59:16.840 --> 59:17.840
This is Zormay.

59:17.840 --> 59:18.840
Hello, it's Zormay.

59:18.840 --> 59:19.840
What's up with mine?

59:19.840 --> 59:28.520
Yeah, I just wanted to talk about just like an overall gaming this year.

59:28.520 --> 59:33.400
You know it's like this week, Mario Galaxy and Assassin's Creed is coming out.

59:33.400 --> 59:38.440
Do y'all find it hard to keep up with all these games?

59:38.440 --> 59:47.360
Like I know we have like, you're married, Loki, along with Dr. Kara.

59:47.360 --> 59:49.160
This is a huge week for games.

59:49.160 --> 59:50.400
Yeah, this is feedback.

59:50.400 --> 59:53.840
I know this is, with Christmas and everything, it's just like everything is coming out this

59:53.840 --> 59:54.840
week.

59:54.840 --> 01:00:01.080
Well, I'm trying to say, do you need a chance to actually play them all?

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:06.560
Do you find yourself able to play them like as if you would play it, like do you get all

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.840
your fun out of them, like your money for it?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.400
Do we have time to play all these games?

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400
Oh, no.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.360
Well, given all the other projects that I have going on myself, I don't have time.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.360
Hold on.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.560
We're getting the really bad echo, Zormay, so we're going to have to let you go, but

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.600
we'll answer your questions or keep listening to the show.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.680
But unfortunately, we're getting the really bad echo, I'm sorry, buddy.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.240
But let's answer the question, do we have time to play all these games that come out?

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.440
I personally do not, just given that I have a very busy schedule.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.920
I know I'm also, I haven't gone into a lot of detail on this, but I'm working on an illustration

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920
project.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.920
I'm still going to classes as a massage therapist.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.840
I work as a massage therapist, too.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.320
And with my full-time job, I don't have as much time as I would like to play some of

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.440
these games, although I am dedicating time to Portal next week.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.440
I wish I had more time for games, but I find myself the same problem with the day job and

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.400
relationships and everything, but here's my problem is that I keep coming back to the

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.280
freaking MMOs that suck my life away, and I'm talking about WoW, Final Fantasy XI, if

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.720
Jamie gets her way, Ragnarok, my friends trying to get me into Tabula Rasa, which I really

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720
want to check out.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.240
You know, there's just all these freaking MMOs I keep getting sucked into, and those

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.840
are games that never finish, so you just keep going back for more, and I never have time

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.160
to play the console games.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.560
But I do try to play a little bit of everything.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.160
That's what makes it so easy to stay on top of the Xbox Live Arcade releases and everything.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.240
You know, those are delivered right to your doorstep, and they're usually really short

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.240
games.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.380
I try to sample as much as I can, but I may not play everything.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.640
For example, right now, when I was playing Portal, I wasn't playing Halo 3 or anything

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640
else like that.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.400
In Assassin's Creed, to be honest, I only played about 15 minutes of it today, and same

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.860
with Super Mario Galaxy, I think I maybe played half an hour of it.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:51.720
I used to buy games left and right that I would probably only end up playing for like

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.060
an hour, but I've really learned to curb that this year, and I've seriously been a good

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.480
boy and not bought games that I don't plan on spending serious time with.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.200
So that's my other problem, is that, you know, remember, we do this for the love of the game

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.280
because we're fans of gaming and everything.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.080
We don't get a lot of free games from companies.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.740
Once in a great while, we've gotten free games, and so, you know, if we had more free games,

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.500
we could easily dedicate, you know, an hour between three of us, you know, each playing

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.500
games or whatever.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.080
The last free game I got was Dragon's Lair HD.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.360
I can't remember the last free game we got.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:28.000
Last free game I got, and I don't want it, and I will be selling it back, Viva Pinata

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Party Animals.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Aw, sorry to hear it.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Well, I'll take that back.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.680
Dan got us our Halo 3 for free, and a bunch of other stuff.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:39.040
The last free one I can remember getting was the mid-way- a mid-way rep I met at a show

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:43.400
was kind enough to give me one of those arcade classics, which was great for me because I

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.920
loved that shit, those AD games, so that was cool, but that was a long time ago.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:47.920
Oh no.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.920
Play Overlord.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.960
Folks in chat are suggesting Gamefly.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.920
Yes, I will play Overlord, I swear.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.960
I will step away from Final Fantasy XI this week, the crack, the crack, and play some

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.960
Overlord.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960
All right.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.720
Skype line is still open if you want to give us a call.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.040
Just a word of advice, call Echo 1-2-3 before you call us on the Skype, and that way you

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.580
can hear what you sound like, and you can hear if there's any, like, echoing or any

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.580
of that stuff.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.180
If your microphone is really close to your speakers, that's what causes the echo, so

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.180
sorry.

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.180
It's okay.

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:19.000
Any other last minute stories real quick while we wait for some more calls?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.480
Yeah, of course I do.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.680
Anyways, Attack of the Show is now in the Guinness Book of World Records for creating

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.280
the largest arcade machine.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:36.880
It is 1,300 pounds, has 150 arcade games built into it, 14 feet tall, and has a 75 inch screen,

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.440
plus it requires quarters that are 3 inches big.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.840
They like big things on that program, don't they, because they made a big Nintendo once,

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:43.840
didn't they?

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.840
I remember that at 1E3.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:45.840
They had that out there.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.200
And I will one-up everything they do.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.440
All right, let's go to the phones.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440
We have another call.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.440
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.440
Who's this?

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.440
Hello.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.440
Hi.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.440
Who is this?

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.440
Hello.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.440
This is Marissa.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:57.440
Hello.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.440
Marissa!

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.440
Marissa!

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.440
Hey.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.440
What's on your mind?

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.440
I was calling to say hello.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:06.160
It's so nice to be able to hear the show this evening.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160
Yes.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160
It's a blast.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160
Very random that you're listening to us live.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.160
Hello?

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.160
We love it.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160
I said it's very random that you're listening to us live.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.160
We love it.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160
That's very cool.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.560
I actually finally came across this thing known as a computer, and I purchased one.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.000
I had been out of one for about a year because I just didn't have the money, but now I'm

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
back.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.720
But I unfortunately have Windows Vista on a budget laptop, so I'm kind of screwed game

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.720
wise.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.720
Excellent.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.520
Now, since you have a new computer, has your gaming on the PC consisted of Solitaire and

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520
Minesweeper?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.600
Well, especially on Vista.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.280
With what bloatware Vista is, yeah, because it eats all my memory.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:50.880
Although I was lucky enough, I went to Target before going to Seattle to try to get some

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.880
games because I took a train trip to Seattle.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.280
And so I wanted to have something to pass the time because it's like 38 hours.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.280
And I got King's Quest.

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280
Awesome.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.280
King's Quest is the shit.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:11.280
They re-released all of them onto, you know, it's supposed to be compatible with Windows

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.760
2000, but it doesn't work for Vista very well, but oh well, that was cool.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.440
That sucks because the King's Quest series was amazing.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.200
I loved those games when I was younger, especially King's Quest IV.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.800
That was always my favorite because it was based on the fairy tales.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.800
That was cool.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.880
I basically bought a laptop and went backwards in time because the first thing I did was

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.800
get King's Quest and then the new Simon Max.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800
Very, very cool.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800
Very cool.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.920
That was really cool, but I don't like these episodic games because I don't like paying

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.200
$20 for like half an hour worth of games.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200
Here's the thing.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.280
You've got to get GameTap because not only are all the King's Quest games available on

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.440
there, but they also have the Sam and Max, but the only bummer is you have to have an

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.960
internet connection, so it's not so great for the train.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.320
But you know, you can play for like $9.85 a month all the new Sam and Max games.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:59.160
God, I sound like a commercial, but I wouldn't hype it up if it wasn't good.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.160
I mean, it is good.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.160
I think they've done a good thing, and I know a lot of people are rightfully so skeptical

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.840
about GameTap, but I think overall in the big picture, I mean, they've got like a thousand

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.960
games on there, classics, new stuff.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.360
I mean, Overlord is available on GameTap and some other stuff, so it's good.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.360
It's a good thing.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.360
Oh, sweet.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.360
Old stuff for me.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.360
Otherwise, the dude bought an Xbox.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.360
Oh, really?

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:26.640
Yeah, so now I've spent my evenings falling asleep in front of the TV while he plays Medal

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.640
of Honor.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.640
Good times.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640
Good times.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.640
Good times.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:31.640
He dates up in a 360, right?

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.640
Yes.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.800
I'm going to have to talk to you later to get his gamertag, and I'll give you Dan's

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800
and mine.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800
Oh, quite simple.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800
Long hair Chris.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.800
Long hair Chris.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800
Oh, that makes...

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.800
That's a castle, my boyfriend.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.800
There you go.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.120
You do know like thousands of people that hear our show just heard that, right?

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.840
If you get some more friend requests this week, you'll know why.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:56.000
Well, okay, I'll go ahead and put Dan's on there, except I can't remember if it's with

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.800
an underscore or not, but it would be Gunstar Hero.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800
Okay.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.800
So, I'll let you know for sure later, and mine I never use, so I'll let you know later.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:09.280
But if he's got Halo 3, he should totally play with Dan so I can see Dan get punked.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280
Let's all play Uno.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.280
He's waiting for that, yeah.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.840
I'm not trying to talk him into getting the orange box, because I really want to play

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.840
Portal.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.840
Yeah.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.840
And he won't stop singing the song.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.840
Isn't the song great?

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.680
Okay, I didn't get it at first, and it was when I finally saw it that I was like, this

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.680
is the best song ever.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680
Seriously, Jamie was...

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.720
I remember when that song was in the cage match, and Jamie was like, this song is stupid.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:29.720
Why do people love this song?

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.840
Well, no, I said as a song without a frame of reference, it wasn't a very good song,

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.520
but now that I have the framework, now that I logged into that stupid site and took the

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:42.800
quiz that was on it, the personality thing, I was like, holy crap, this is messed up.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800
I love it.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:48.480
Okay, yes, I think that's why it is so cool, although it does bring a different dimension

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.520
of weird when your coworker is singing it in a high-pitched falsetto while you're on

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.520
the phone with a client.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.520
Oh, that's cool.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.520
Nice.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.520
Well, Marissa...

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.520
Oh, how'd you guys go?

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.520
It was great catching up.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.800
Marissa, please, please log into Xbox Live sometime and we'll play Uno.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.480
Oh, sweet.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.520
And I'll hook up my webcam and play Strip Uno.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:05.520
No, just kidding.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.520
Do you have an Amazon wish list ready?

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.520
I can't wait.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.520
All right.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.520
Come on, baby.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.200
Marissa, thanks so much for calling.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.200
We love you.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200
Bye, Marissa.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.200
Come back and be in the studio soon, okay?

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.200
Okay, bye.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200
All right, bye.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:27.440
She has to come back soon so we can hear more stories about the Wunderbra.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.040
These Wunderbra ears.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.040
That was it.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.040
I thought it was the Wunderbra.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.040
Great.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:35.720
All right, more last-minute stories.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.800
We'll take one more call if anybody calls in, 877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.800
Launch Radio.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:47.480
Anyways, there's apparently a new Bioshock achievement that someone spotted on Live.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:54.000
The rumor is the 51st achievement, which is actually on the list there, is 100 points

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.520
and it is from...

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.520
It's called Bulletproof.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:00.840
Complete the game on hard difficulty without using a Vited Chamber.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.280
So be interesting to see if this actually surfaces maybe in a new update or something

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:07.280
like that.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.160
Anyways, let's see here.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.160
Benjokazooie3, not coming out in 360 anymore.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.160
It's been axed.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.160
So, hooray.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.160
Oh, wait.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:19.920
There was something about...

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.980
I saw on Twitter that there was going to be big news coming out about a 360 exclusive

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:24.980
being axed.

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:25.980
This must be it.

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.980
This is the one.

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:27.980
Oh, snap.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:28.980
All right.

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:29.980
We're getting one more call.

01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:30.980
Oh, it went away.

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:31.980
Never mind.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:35.640
One more thing to kind of go back to the MAME cabinet we were talking about earlier.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.640
Game Raider.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.380
It brings together MAME and beer.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:42.360
It's a beer tap in a MAME cabinet.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360
Hold that thought.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360
We got a call coming in.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.360
I do want to hear more about the beer thing, but this is a conference call, so I'm always

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
worried about these calls.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.360
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.360
Who's this?

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360
Tekken Game Podcast.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.360
Hi.

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:53.580
The Bucket, Toki's and Raiden's Dolphin.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.280
What's up, you guys?

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280
Not much.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.280
You were talking about Sam & Max?

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280
Yes.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.800
Our last caller, Marissa, is a Sam & Max fan.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800
I am huge.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:07.080
I beat the new one today, and oh my God, it's awesome.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080
Is it?

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.160
About how long of gaming was it?

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.340
About five hours, but they really changed up some things about it.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:18.520
They added Stinky's Tavern as a restaurant, 50's theme.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.520
Really nice.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.520
I really love it.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.320
And Santa goes nuts.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.320
Can't go wrong with that.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.320
Lots of fun.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.320
Lots of fun stuff.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.880
Those are great.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.720
Is this taking a lot of time on your show recently, the Sam & Max series?

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720
No.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.720
Call of Duty.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.720
Call of Duty.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.720
Well that's cool.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.720
Sam & Max is a good franchise.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.640
One of those ones I need to spend more time with, but those damn MMOs, you know how it

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640
goes.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.640
No.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.720
Yeah, but this one has a hit feature, so it's much easier for the noobs to get in.

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.320
Marissa, in our chat room, actually follows up and says, Sam & Max rules, but Indiana

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:57.640
Jones and the fate of Atlantis is still number one in my heart.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:58.640
How about Loom?

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640
That's fine.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640
Where's the love for Loom?

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640
Loom is great.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640
Loom is awesome.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640
Loom.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.280
Well, what else did you guys want to share with us?

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.280
Anything else?

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.360
Over alerts on GameTap, download it from there.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.720
Well, I have a copy on Xbox 360, and that way I can get achievement points because I'm

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.800
a whore for achievement points.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.800
Ah, you're right.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.800
Yep.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.800
I can play Jericho or something on GameTap.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.800
Ah, Jericho.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.800
Didn't Jericho suck?

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.240
Well, I've heard that, but I want to see that firsthand, if it does suck.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.360
Okay, because that's what everyone said to me, like, big disappointment, it sucks, stay

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360
away.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.080
Yeah, that's what I keep hearing, but I like to see these things firsthand.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.000
I will tell you what kind of cool zombie game I've been playing on GameTap is Typing of

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
the Dead.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000
That game is shit.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Oh, that's awesome.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I've been playing that a little.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.840
It's a steep learning curve to get all those letters in.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.040
I can type uber fast.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.920
Maybe because you can't type, Raven.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.800
You type with two fingers, Raven, that you're not going to get very far doing that.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.800
Nah, you're right.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.800
All right.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.560
Well, kids, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.560
so much for calling.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560
Thanks for taking our call.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560
You're welcome.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.560
Have a good one, you guys.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.560
Have fun with your show.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
All right.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.920
Raven and DeBucket from Tekken Games, which I think is beating us on Op 11 still.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:03.920
You go, boys.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.920
All right.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.920
Any other last minute stories?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.920
We're talking about the beer and maim machine.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:07.920
Yes.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920
Skypline is now closed, kids.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.360
Sorry if those didn't get through.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:17.080
The Gamerator, it's $2,000, but it's a custom-built maim cabinet, and it comes preloaded, of course,

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.080
with 180 games.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:24.960
Plus, it's got an internal AV hookups, lets you throw your PC or console in there as well.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.160
And then, of course, it doubles as a keg.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.960
It's got tap and everything, so that's awesome.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.000
Beer and maim together.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.840
Another interesting thing, I guess, there is a sequel to Dig Dug 2 coming.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:43.640
I guess it's called Dig Dug Islands.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:51.920
It's actually being, Namco Bandai has partnered with Verx to produce it as an online PC game.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:56.160
So if you're interested in more Dig Dug, there you go.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160
Some last bits.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.120
There already was like a Dig Dug one and a half on DS.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.440
I had it.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.320
Yeah, Dig Dug DS.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.840
I have it.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:12.400
Anyways, Nexon, of course, that South Korean company doing a lot of MMOs and stuff, they're

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:18.000
developing a couple games for, well, one for the Xbox 360 and one for the DS.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.540
MapleStory is coming to the DS, so that's the one that's being worked on right now.

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:28.040
The other one is a MMO called Mabinogi, and that's coming to the 360.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:35.400
So I guess Mabinogi is a cel-shaded MMO that looks interesting.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:38.560
And then MapleStory, you know, I think a lot of people are familiar with MapleStory, so

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.520
for the DS that would be pretty cool.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.800
And then I guess Live is doing something for their 5th anniversary starting November 15th.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.400
Lots of parties online.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.400
Uno for everybody.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.880
Well, you know, that's interesting because that's starting on Wednesday.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.320
I wonder if they got any really kick-ass Xbox Live arcade games for that day.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.240
They haven't said what's coming out this week, have they?

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.240
No, not yet.

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.700
Maybe they're sitting on something good.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.680
What are some really like highly anticipated games we haven't got yet?

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680
Rez?

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680
Rez would be fucking awesome.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680
Yeah, that's true.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680
It could be that.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.680
Hell no.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.680
Oh, the hella famous shooter, Treasure.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.680
Omega 5?

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.680
Omega 5?

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.680
No, the one that's...

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.680
Igaruga?

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.680
Radiant Silver Gun.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:19.680
Igaruga is the one that...

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.680
Igaruga.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.680
Yeah.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.040
But Omega 5, they've been pimping that out for a while now.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.480
That'd be kind of cool.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.200
Well, the party starts on Microsoft this week.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.520
I thought Screw Jumper was coming out.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.160
Did that already come out, Screw Jumper?

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:33.600
Oh, I think they have confirmed that is this week's title, Screw Jumper, but there could

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600
be a second one that's really cool.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.600
Yeah, there could be a second one.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.600
Screw Jumper looks stupid.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.600
It might be okay.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.600
It might be okay.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.600
All right.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.080
Well, if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then we're going to go around and wrap up

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.520
this show by going around and getting everybody's final thought.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.960
DarkSakura, thank you as always for blessing us with your presence.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960
What's your final thought?

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.080
My final thought is I can't find where I can save this wallpaper to so that I can make

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.320
it fit my desktop.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.840
And I'll thank myself for blessing the show with my presence, and my final thought is

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:04.400
I want enchiladas really bad, because looking at this Aldoberto's mug makes me crave horchata's.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.880
Loki, thank you as always for being here, and what's your final thought?

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:11.520
Final thought is there's plenty of games for me to play this week.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.520
All right.

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520
Sounds good.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.520
Lots of stuff to play.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.280
If only there were like 30 hours in the day as opposed to 24.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.040
I'm glad I've made special arrangements for my consoles early on.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.920
All right, folks, that's... Oh, what?

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.920
My PC is still down, so did I pump up the volume for the immediate future?

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:28.920
Yeah.

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:33.480
The only weekly shows we have going regularly right now are Thursday night, DMN is still

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:38.800
doing the Insanest Hour, and Saturday I believe Travis Donovan is back up and running after

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.120
a little bit of a summer hiatus.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.860
I know he had a show this week.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.500
So hopefully by the new year we'll be up and running with lots of shows.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:51.520
We are in talks to do some stuff, so we'll get back to you with that.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:57.200
And just also the FYI, next week, week after I will not be here.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.200
Cry.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.460
And the week after that.

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.920
You may get the... Well, one of those weeks-

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.920
I'll be in Alabama.

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:02.920
We're not going to be here at all.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.920
Yeah.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920
We're going to take a break from the show.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.520
I believe the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I think we agreed we can just not have a show

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.520
that week.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.840
Although that's going to be a big gaming week with Rock Band and everything.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.560
I think we'll live if we take a week off.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.720
Well, hopefully we'll talk about that earlier.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720
We'll see.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.720
I'm crossing my fingers.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.400
But you can get the Loki and Rob show the week after.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.360
We'll hold down the fort, even though Dark Soccer will be on a plane back from Alabama.

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.880
I'll be fine to go that Sunday anyways.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.880
No, we'll see.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880
Maybe we'll do.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.880
We haven't decided yet.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880
I don't know.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.880
We could use a break though.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:33.480
I take that time during Thanksgiving to travel somewhere, so I kind of want to go back to

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.480
Magic Mountain.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.480
We'll see.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.480
I've got to find somebody to go with me though.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.280
Hopefully it hasn't burned down yet.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.280
Hope not.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.280
Hope not.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280
All right.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280
Well, that's it.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.120
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting and

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.120
independent radio.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.120
We've said that a lot tonight.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.360
Again, if you guys like what you hear, or even if you don't like what you hear, please

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.660
still help us out by telling two people you know about the program.

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:58.240
If you can't think of anybody to tell, then spread the word on the internet.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.600
You can do that through iTunes by leaving us a positive reviewer or one of those many,

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:06.360
many sites like Podcast Alley, Yahoo Podcasts, Digg, whatever the hell.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.720
Just help us spread the word.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.720
We really appreciate it.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.920
You guys are awesome.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:13.940
Until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:14.940
That is Loki.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:15.940
She is Dark Sakura.

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:19.160
And together, we are not Captain Planet.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.620
No, we are not Captain Planet, but we are Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:43.780
So take care, and we'll see you next week.

01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.620
Bye.
