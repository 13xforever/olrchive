00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:25,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, November 25th, 2007, Guitar Hero gets sued for sounding too good, Super Mario Galaxy has super sales, and Captain Kirk officially endorses World of Warcraft.

2
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everybody out there on the Internet.

3
00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:35,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:41,265
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that video game program dedicated, of course, to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:45,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me not tonight is DarkSakura.

7
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:46,227
[SPEAKER_06]: She has the night off.

8
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:48,709
[SPEAKER_06]: She's off for the holidays in Alabama.

9
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:50,850
[SPEAKER_06]: We might hear from her a little bit later, though.

10
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,230
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

11
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,312
[SPEAKER_06]: But joining us in studio, say hello to the one and only Loki.

12
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:54,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

13
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,313
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Loki?

14
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:57,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

15
00:00:57,613 --> 00:00:57,893
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

16
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:00,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And since we had an extra seat tonight, we thought we'd bring back

17
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:04,212
[SPEAKER_06]: A familiar guest for those that have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for some time.

18
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Intern Drew is here tonight.

19
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:07,252
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, guys?

20
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:07,892
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

21
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:08,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, fair.

22
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:09,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

23
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:15,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Drew, since DarkSakura's not here tonight, we are going to be relying on you to present the female perspective of gaming.

24
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:16,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be your job, Rob?

25
00:01:17,214 --> 00:01:17,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no.

26
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,155
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you trying to imply?

27
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:20,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to say something?

28
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:21,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, nothing.

29
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:22,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing at all.

30
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:23,156
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought.

31
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:23,476
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

32
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:25,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get us started tonight.

33
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:27,697
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about how is your gaming week.

34
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:29,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And since Jamie's not here, we'll start with Loki.

35
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:33,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, let's see.

36
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,436
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was not filled with Rock Band.

37
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,336
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be surprised.

38
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:39,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really play Rock Band this week.

39
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:50,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, like Guitar Hero and all the other music games before them, they are sitting in a nice bundle in a box or whatever in the corner of the room while I play other things.

40
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we played actually some Project Gotham Racing 3 this week.

41
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:56,146
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a little multiplayer on that.

42
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, Project Gotham Racing 3?

43
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:57,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Three.

44
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:58,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Old school.

45
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:07,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the reason why we played that one instead of 4 is because I have 5 copies of Project Gotham Racing 3 and not 5 copies of Project Gotham Racing 4.

46
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes it a little difficult to play that game multiplayer otherwise.

47
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so we did that, and then Saints Row, of course, as usual.

48
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:21,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And a little bit of Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, which is fun.

49
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:24,914
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of Catan, because that's also fun.

50
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:43,870
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the game I've been mainly playing the last few days is Zelda Phantom Hourglass because I, you know, originally I had a DS and then it was a nice, you know, silver fat one, you know, like it came out at launch and then the music came on and everything went to hell.

51
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to God, everything's broken tonight.

52
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Those who are listening live tonight, we had to do three retakes to start the show tonight.

53
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:50,453
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Jamie's not here.

54
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:51,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It all falls apart.

55
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:51,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the hell's going on.

56
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:52,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

57
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:53,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go again.

58
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:54,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

59
00:02:55,788 --> 00:03:16,217
[SPEAKER_05]: So then, let's see, so yeah, basically ended up trading my silver DS fat for a pink DS light for my wife, and then I bought a non-pink DS light for myself, a black one, so now I have my true official game for myself, because my wife has claimed all the other ones.

60
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:19,879
[SPEAKER_05]: What else did I play this week?

61
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:20,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's

62
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:27,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine because of the holidays and all, everybody's gaming weeks was a little bit abbreviated.

63
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:29,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I guess.

64
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a good turkey day?

65
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:32,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, we had two turkeys.

66
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:34,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Pig?

67
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:35,569
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

68
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,730
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not eat two turkeys.

69
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We had two turkeys.

70
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

71
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:41,311
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them was at the table.

72
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:45,073
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we had, we had, um, because it's an interesting story.

73
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:45,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, um,

74
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:54,574
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Thanksgiving over at Nellie's parents' house, and they had bought a turkey, and then Nellie's dad won a turkey at work.

75
00:03:54,654 --> 00:04:01,039
[SPEAKER_05]: The ironic thing is he doesn't like turkey, but he won one anyways, so they had two turkeys there.

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,123
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's funny, because I don't like turkey either, so they always have to make ham.

77
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:07,284
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, turkey's not bad.

78
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:11,868
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I don't want to... They were trying to feed me tons of that turkey, and I'm like...

79
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not eating all that.

80
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, then they wanted me to carve the turkey.

81
00:04:15,764 --> 00:04:17,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I don't know how to fucking carve a turkey.

82
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give it my best try, but shit.

83
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that was my gaming week.

84
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

85
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:25,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew, intern Drew, you want to go next?

86
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:26,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

87
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:30,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I haven't been playing much World of Warcraft since my subscription expired.

88
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:31,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Cry.

89
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,401
[SPEAKER_08]: But surprisingly, I've been involved in FPS.

90
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Battlefield 2 and getting my ranking up.

91
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,291
[SPEAKER_08]: All the way to Sergeant so far, which is kind of cool.

92
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I like playing a medic.

93
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:54,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, second playthrough of Tales of Symphonia, catching in some Twilight Princess and a little Wild Arms 4.

94
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much spectacular, but it's fun stuff.

95
00:04:59,216 --> 00:04:59,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

96
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:01,397
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week.

97
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:01,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

98
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:06,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing the brand new Final Fantasy XI expansion, Wings of the Goddess, which...

99
00:05:07,731 --> 00:05:11,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Square Enix, I mean, you really blew it with this.

100
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know what to say.

101
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the game itself is cool.

102
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get to that in a minute.

103
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:15,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about the launch.

104
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:29,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, when you have an MMO and you're going to launch an expansion, you can expect that, like, all your freaking players who are addicted to this game, especially Final Fantasy XI people who are pretty rabid about Final Fantasy XI, are going to be in on this game trying to register the game.

105
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:32,180
[SPEAKER_06]: You can expect they're going to all be on at once.

106
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what happens?

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Their registration servers go down.

108
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:36,699
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

109
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:53,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuck at authenticating.

110
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically, it was just lots of people were hammering the servers and it was basically breaking it.

111
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:03,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they just thought that your copy was not authentic enough.

112
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm looking right at it.

113
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this not look like the real deal?

114
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:07,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

115
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:10,247
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks like the real deal forgery to me.

116
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:10,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

117
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:14,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the other thing is that the PC version of the game was delayed.

118
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,653
[SPEAKER_06]: The game was supposed to hit shelves on what, like Tuesday or, no, ship Tuesday to shelf Wednesday, right?

119
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:20,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what happens?

120
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:25,476
[SPEAKER_06]: The PC version gets delayed by a day, which means that in reality it didn't come out on Thanksgiving, obviously.

121
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:26,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out on Black Friday.

122
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:27,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

123
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:27,577
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

124
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:31,951
[SPEAKER_05]: What Final Fantasy game would it be if it weren't delayed a little bit?

125
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:36,217
[SPEAKER_06]: But the fun thing is, it was only the PC version in the US that got delayed.

126
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody's playing Dancer and Scholar, all the people in Japan and Europe are playing the new classes, and all the PC players are just...

127
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:43,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Tear.

128
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:46,569
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, this is how rabid people are, okay?

129
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,613
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at the Final Fantasy XI forums, and people are like, okay, here's what you can do.

130
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:54,758
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game.

131
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:56,821
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a real threat I saw on Wednesday, the workaround.

132
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:59,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game.

133
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:02,473
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

134
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:23,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking addicts, just wait your turn.

135
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:27,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to wait for our... This is what I finally decided to do, is wait.

136
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:29,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess people are still having problems getting on there.

137
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:31,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I did finally get my copy registered yesterday.

138
00:07:31,656 --> 00:07:34,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they fixed some servers, but they kind of botched the launch.

139
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:45,402
[SPEAKER_06]: As for the game itself, I was kind of hoping for a little bit more for the users that are not at the endgame level yet, like me, because I've been playing this game for how many years yet?

140
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:49,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I can never seem to level a job past like 55, because I have extreme ADD.

141
00:07:50,454 --> 00:07:53,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that and all the fucking level cap quests suck.

142
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:58,921
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got to say, you know, with all the changes they made to Final Fantasy XI, they've made a lot of changes for the better.

143
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:02,584
[SPEAKER_06]: They've made items not so impossible to get in many ways.

144
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,346
[SPEAKER_06]: The economy's eh.

145
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

146
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the game's made a lot of improvements.

147
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:10,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Classes have gotten changes that needed it.

148
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:12,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And the new classes are pretty cool.

149
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:15,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Dancer's pretty awesome and helps with small parties.

150
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:16,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And Scholar's kind of cool, too.

151
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:19,698
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean I don't have to compete with bots to get a frickin' pair of lizard boots anymore?

152
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:24,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're Rare EX now, so it does them no good to camp Lizzie because the boots are Rare EX.

153
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they get it, they can't sell it.

154
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:29,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I would camp it and drop the boots just to piss people off.

155
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:31,625
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome.

156
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,108
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of time, though.

157
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,413
[SPEAKER_06]: You call me sad for clicking retry over and over.

158
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:36,215
[SPEAKER_05]: You should play WoW.

159
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:37,638
[SPEAKER_05]: They welcome people like you.

160
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have time to do that stuff.

161
00:08:39,242 --> 00:08:39,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

162
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:40,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at my gaming week.

163
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:42,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

164
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:18,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, the game itself, I need a little more time to explore the new areas, but I like some of the new music and some of the old areas I went into.

165
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any new areas?

166
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:23,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're the old areas 20 years ago.

167
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:27,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's different mobs and the, you know, it's not the exact same thing with different colors.

168
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:34,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for instance, one of the areas I traveled to in the past, Rollinberry Fields, you go to it in the past and you see, like, destruction.

169
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:37,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's supposed to be, like, 20 years ago when the war was going on, the Crystal War was going on.

170
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:38,888
[SPEAKER_06]: You see destruction.

171
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:42,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there'll be holes in the path where it looks like cannonballs have struck the path and things like that.

172
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:44,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not, like, the exact same thing with different colors.

173
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:46,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you go to the towns and stuff when they're like that, too?

174
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't go to Juno, but apparently you can go to the other big three, Sandoria and

175
00:09:50,563 --> 00:09:52,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, Caverns of Time!

176
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:59,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but the Crystal War thing was written in the XI story long before WoW was out, so you can't say they did off WoW.

177
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,113
[SPEAKER_06]: That's debatable.

178
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch the intro movie sometime.

179
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:06,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but they've had that in since Warcraft 2.

180
00:10:06,978 --> 00:10:07,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't we have both?

181
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't there room for both?

182
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Why has it always got to be WoW versus whatever?

183
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:11,702
[SPEAKER_06]: There's room for both.

184
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:14,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing both right now, and not much else.

185
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:15,666
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because you're a double addict.

186
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:17,127
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did play Rock Band.

187
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought Rock Band.

188
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:24,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not spend $170 on the Deluxe Bundle.

189
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:32,020
[SPEAKER_06]: After our preview last week, I was like, you know, I just don't think I'm going to want to go through the setup of setting up the drums and everything this much.

190
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,742
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I love that guitar, I thought the guitar was a great controller, I'm kind of pissed off.

191
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:39,436
[SPEAKER_06]: The companies can't play together.

192
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,399
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how that guitar won't work with Guitar Hero?

193
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It will.

194
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:44,662
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some compatibility.

195
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:45,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Only on PlayStation 3.

196
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:46,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Only on PS3.

197
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that does me a fuck of a lot of good.

198
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:51,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, if I remember correctly, I think it was...

199
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:58,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say the Rock Band ones weren't working on Guitar Hero 3 or something like that.

200
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,041
[SPEAKER_06]: All I know is that the Guitar Hero 2 controller works with both.

201
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:02,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, you know what?

202
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just continue to use that.

203
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:06,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though my yellow button is starting to stick a little bit, I'll just use that.

204
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the Rock Band songs aren't particularly hard.

205
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:13,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I notice I'm doing way better on hard level on Rock Band than I do on Guitar Hero.

206
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,228
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's just because... I think...

207
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:27,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit better of a learning curve than Guitar Hero because in the hard difficulty on Rock Band, I noticed they add the fifth button, but they don't use it a lot, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero.

208
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:30,165
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get some time to adjust to that.

209
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:30,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

210
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Because your pinkies are weak.

211
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:36,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I haven't had as much problems adjusting to Rock Band at all.

212
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:39,208
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be honest, I've only explored single player mode.

213
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I have yet to make a band.

214
00:11:42,096 --> 00:11:43,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have yet to explore that mode.

215
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:47,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't really give a full review on the game, other than I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.

216
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,303
[SPEAKER_08]: That's because you don't have any friends, because of how unlikable you are.

217
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to be able to make a band for single player.

218
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I want to be able to make my bandmates, you know?

219
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:08,037
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I kind of... I was under the impression that's what you were going to be able to do, was to make your own, like, bands, and make your characters, and you can, like, play each one individually, and then have them all come together, but I guess not.

220
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:10,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there would be no bass man.

221
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:16,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, because there's no base single player mode, which I was surprised to find out too.

222
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:18,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I guess there's little places they can improve.

223
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love the presentation of Rock Band.

224
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:25,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the way it looks and how your characters get integrated into like the loading screens.

225
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:25,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's hilarious.

226
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,357
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very cool.

227
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:31,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, not a whole lot else I've been playing because of Thanksgiving and all.

228
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And mine was great, thanks for asking.

229
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:34,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Very small.

230
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,759
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not have two turkeys like Loki's house did.

231
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,480
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

232
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:42,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I said at the end of last week's show we were going to be here after all, but maybe not, I don't know

233
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:10,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we were kind of going back and forth, so we are here this week, but only for one part.

234
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:12,154
[SPEAKER_06]: There will not be two parts to this week's show.

235
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:18,775
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I do believe, in lieu of a Part B, I believe the Wii Zapper Challenge is happening tonight.

236
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:19,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

237
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:19,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

238
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:23,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will be on Op 11 after the show, and of course this will be archived.

239
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:31,817
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be doing the Wii Zapper Challenge where Loki has said that he does not need the Wii Zapper to do good in the game, so he's going to play with just the normal Wiimote.

240
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:35,258
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be using the Wii Zapper, and whoever gets the higher score or what have you...

241
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:36,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

242
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:40,025
[SPEAKER_06]: If I win, you have to take me out.

243
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:41,848
[SPEAKER_06]: If you win, I have to take Nellie out.

244
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:42,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if she won't go out with me?

245
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

246
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:45,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll buy you guys dinner or something.

247
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:46,413
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll make it a lot easier.

248
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,554
[SPEAKER_05]: If I win, you get me a $20 gift card to some

249
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:57,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I still haven't seen the MPD I actually have seen the MPD numbers come up for October but

250
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the eye judgment was just within that.

251
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:34,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, in a few more weeks, we'll have the NPD numbers for November, and I'll let you guys know where eye judgment is standing as far as sales go.

252
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,534
[SPEAKER_06]: On its way to a million in six months.

253
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:37,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

254
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:37,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

255
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,736
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, chat, who said you guys could come up with what the terms of the bet are?

256
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:46,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the chat is expressing some disappointment because they were looking forward to the Loki-Rob date.

257
00:14:47,338 --> 00:14:48,299
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll work something out.

258
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make them buy me dinner still.

259
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

260
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,060
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

261
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So stay tuned for that after the show tonight.

262
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:58,285
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really all I got for housekeeping other than, you know, stay on top of our communities.

263
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:03,830
[SPEAKER_06]: We love having more folks on our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal and our MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.

264
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:11,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I always neglect to mention Facebook, but we do have a group on there, the OL Army, so just search for OLRMY, you'll find it, or Orange Lounge Radio, it'll come up as well.

265
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:15,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Facebook, but there's just so goddamn many apps on Facebook.

266
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, every day I'm getting some freaking request for, like, so-and-so wants to play vampire with you and suck your blood.

267
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:20,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like...

268
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:22,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

269
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks, Drew.

270
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:25,314
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so there you have it.

271
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:31,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the Guitar Hero OL Army fell out of the top 100 this week, and that makes me a sad panda.

272
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need more recruits for the Guitar Hero OL Army.

273
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:35,438
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find us on GuitarHero.com.

274
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,939
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just search for OL Army.

275
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:41,336
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I will say that Richie Maniac still has the number one spot on my Xbox Live list.

276
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:46,180
[SPEAKER_06]: He's on my list, and he's on the Guitar Hero All-Army, and he has like a million groupies.

277
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn you and your achievement horrors.

278
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:52,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he has 2,500 groupies, which is definitely the highest I've seen, so good job.

279
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:56,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news then.

280
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:57,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's going to start us off tonight?

281
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

282
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I will start us off.

283
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:02,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, as we kind of teased in the intro there...

284
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:08,073
[SPEAKER_05]: The Romantics, a wonderful 80s band, I guess.

285
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:12,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm being sarcastic there.

286
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:21,561
[SPEAKER_05]: They are suing over a cover version of their song What I Like About You that appeared in Guitar Hero Encore, Rocks the 80s.

287
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:25,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Because apparently, the song sounds too much like them.

288
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:31,066
[SPEAKER_05]: They want the game sales to be halted, and want...

289
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:39,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Accounting of all profits from the game along with unspecified compensation and punitive damages.

290
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:49,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently their claim is that the song is virtually indistinguishable from the authentic version and therefore would confuse the consumer.

291
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:55,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I don't know.

292
00:16:55,175 --> 00:17:00,599
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I'm just thinking if it's virtually indistinguishable then what's it matter?

293
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:05,248
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like, you know, it sounds like crap and, you know, people are thinking that's the real song.

294
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,449
[SPEAKER_08]: And after that, they're going to sue everyone who five stars on an expert.

295
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:19,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I would think that in the court of law, it's going to come down and the judge is going to say, can we just all agree that this song is so 20 years ago and you all need to get over it?

296
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:23,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the fact that they probably paid to have the licensing of that song?

297
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, I'm sure even though they didn't get the real artist to sing it,

298
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:30,497
[SPEAKER_05]: They have, you know, the license, the rights to the song.

299
00:17:30,777 --> 00:17:35,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's one of those cases where, like, the record company signed it over without them knowing?

300
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that type of thing?

301
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not surprised there.

302
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:39,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

303
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't a similar thing happen in DDR?

304
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:42,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Possibly.

305
00:17:42,243 --> 00:17:48,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone was saying, like, Strictly Business, but I don't see how that... That's a licensed song off of Dance Mania.

306
00:17:48,386 --> 00:17:56,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing with Strictly Business is that the original artist of the song never consented to the song being in the game, and one of the artists went into an arcade one day and saw people playing the song...

307
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,283
[SPEAKER_06]: and was like, what the hell is this?

308
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,124
[SPEAKER_06]: We never said the song could be in the game.

309
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,384
[SPEAKER_06]: But the record company did it.

310
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:06,485
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Rob, they didn't raise much of a fuss when it was in Karaoke Revolution Party.

311
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

312
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,405
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it wasn't a very good cover.

313
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:15,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And plus, Karaoke Revolution doesn't quite have that pop culture recognizability that Guitar Hero does.

314
00:18:16,267 --> 00:18:17,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's actually listen.

315
00:18:17,307 --> 00:18:18,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear some clips.

316
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:21,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the original version of What I Like About You by The Romantics.

317
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:23,528
[SPEAKER_06]: It's buffering.

318
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:24,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little slow.

319
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:39,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that song's still kind of fun, I have to admit.

320
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I bounce up and down.

321
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's listen to what the cover sounds like.

322
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:46,030
[SPEAKER_06]: This is by The Wave Group, and you actually can get this on iTunes.

323
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just getting the clips actually right out of iTunes as well.

324
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:09,417
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I gotta say, it really does sound a lot similar.

325
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:10,197
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't.

326
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,118
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit, a little bit.

327
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:13,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even close.

328
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Pursuing over that?

329
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,400
[SPEAKER_05]: What a crock.

330
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's see, let's see.

331
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:21,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, keep in mind, there's other bands that cover this.

332
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I just had a curiosity, just as like a, what do you call that, a control?

333
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you're doing a science experiment, you have to have a control?

334
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,867
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's actually take a look at a completely different cover.

335
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:34,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So, from the band Kid Pop Rock and Roll Hits...

336
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:37,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, here's the hit crew with What I Like About You.

337
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:40,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit, it's buffering.

338
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:42,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

339
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Virtually undistinguishable.

340
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:57,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, honestly, that's pretty similar too.

341
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:04,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought Kidz Bop was reserved for cage match punishment.

342
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:05,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Make the hurting stop.

343
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not Kidz Bop, it was Kidz Pop.

344
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Same damn thing.

345
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:10,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Big difference.

346
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,690
[SPEAKER_06]: No, big fucking difference.

347
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,351
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a P, not a B, okay?

348
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:17,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also like to point out, okay, I got one more for you guys.

349
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:22,356
[SPEAKER_06]: This song was also covered on an album called The Barbie Hit Mix.

350
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,349
[SPEAKER_07]: See, that's Barbie singing.

351
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I have one question.

352
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:36,675
[SPEAKER_07]: How effective is this mic as a bludgeoning instrument of death?

353
00:20:41,318 --> 00:20:44,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the guitars and everything sound very similar.

354
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:46,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does Barbie look like one of the Olsen twins?

355
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:47,703
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm wondering, too.

356
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at the cover of this going, wow, Barbie got really slutty.

357
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:51,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

358
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:53,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Got really slutty?

359
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:58,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Nim in chat says, Barbie is made of plastic, no mouth.

360
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,022
[SPEAKER_06]: How does she talk?

361
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:02,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Same the way Britney Spears does.

362
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,888
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, given the same circumstances.

363
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:07,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you a hint, kids.

364
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:08,570
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the devil.

365
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

366
00:21:13,394 --> 00:21:14,175
[SPEAKER_06]: They're being sued.

367
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:15,476
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

368
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:16,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew, what do you think?

369
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:18,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any weight to this lawsuit?

370
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:20,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think the romantics have a claim here or what?

371
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,101
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

372
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:26,302
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is not even remotely similar.

373
00:21:27,423 --> 00:21:30,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It's similar as me singing this song, okay?

374
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:31,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

375
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:32,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, would you?

376
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,010
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I won't.

377
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Rob.

378
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:35,951
[SPEAKER_05]: You will.

379
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:39,014
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's just, it's stupid.

380
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:40,836
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stupid.

381
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:47,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I say yes, it's similar, but at the same time, somebody who had the rights to this song agreed to let the song in the game.

382
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:55,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if it came out that the developers got no permission to use this song whatsoever, then I would say they have a case.

383
00:21:56,705 --> 00:22:05,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing as I'm pretty sure they got the rights somewhere, whether that be they went directly to the record label and never approached the band, well, then the band should take that up with the record label.

384
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you signing our stuff over to video games that are going to remake our songs too similarly?

385
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:12,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Or why didn't you just let them use the original version for more money or what have you?

386
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:19,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if the song was licensed, then go QQ some more, Romantics.

387
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:23,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Or perhaps the band should have a more unique voice that can't be copied so easily.

388
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,266
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is wrong with them?

389
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:30,888
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN Nourishment says in chat, bottom line, sue the record company for signing and not Activision.

390
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop fucking whining.

391
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:35,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Nim says, there's a difference between similar and same.

392
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,991
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a cover, then it's different, and they are going to be made a fool of.

393
00:22:40,231 --> 00:22:43,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Escapist says, I want to see Loki pop advertised on late night TV.

394
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: And Radink360 says, Loki should sing it in the Tingle costume.

395
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:49,374
[SPEAKER_06]: There you have it.

396
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of love for Loki singing.

397
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:54,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you could put out an album that would be bigger than Shatner.

398
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to do that.

399
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:01,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not that I could tell you where you can find clips on the internet of Loki singing, but I'll give you a hint.

400
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:04,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock Band is the topic of our next story.

401
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:07,517
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did something with Rock Band very recently.

402
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:12,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, Rock Band has opened up a store.

403
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:12,939
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

404
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:14,539
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new store with accessories.

405
00:23:14,899 --> 00:23:18,020
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole drum bag you can actually buy on this store.

406
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,421
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a $50 bag.

407
00:23:20,014 --> 00:23:22,315
[SPEAKER_06]: to basically keep that whole drum set in.

408
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I want that.

409
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:24,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It is kind of nice, but it's $50.

410
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:25,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

411
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:26,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I want that.

412
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:28,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it worth $50, though?

413
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:29,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It is worth $50.

414
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:29,739
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why, though?

415
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Because have you ever tried buying a bag for consoles?

416
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, I have numerous times.

417
00:23:35,322 --> 00:23:39,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Those fucking backpacks that they have for the Xbox 360 are like $70.

418
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:40,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking ridiculous.

419
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:41,825
[SPEAKER_05]: That looks nice.

420
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:49,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I gotta admit, it does look kinda nice, but I don't know, I mean, like, god, you already spent $170 on the game, do you really need to spend $50 more?

421
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:59,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they have, like, you can buy actual guitars on that website and shit, like... Yeah, I know, there's other members... It's like, I just bought $169 worth of fake instruments, let's buy some real ones too, yay!

422
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:05,426
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, before we get to the next story, speaking of Guitar Hero, I'm a little...

423
00:24:05,964 --> 00:24:07,665
[SPEAKER_06]: A little more Guitar Hero, a little less Rock Band.

424
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that thing?

425
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:13,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tiger Claw was sharing this with our forum people, and he was asking me about this before the show.

426
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that whole Guitar Hero in the blender thing?

427
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:16,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that website.

428
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,070
[SPEAKER_06]: They put that on the Will It Blend.

429
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,710
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the question.

430
00:24:20,651 --> 00:24:22,492
[SPEAKER_06]: And they actually put the controller in the blender.

431
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:23,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, half of it.

432
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:25,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to post spoilers, but yes.

433
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:29,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything blends, except for Norris.

434
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:30,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that website now.

435
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,356
[SPEAKER_05]: You should check that out.

436
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:33,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I giggled my head off watching that.

437
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:37,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, I like how Loki used the appropriate verb.

438
00:24:37,718 --> 00:24:41,220
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't laugh, he giggled when he watched Will It Blend.

439
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:41,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob?

440
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:42,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

441
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:45,844
[SPEAKER_08]: They did put Chuck Norris in the blender on that segment.

442
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,345
[SPEAKER_08]: What, like a cardboard cutout or something?

443
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:49,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Action figure.

444
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:51,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.

445
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:58,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize to all listeners for bringing up Chuck, but it had to be done.

446
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:03,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, those people that are behind the marketing of that blender...

447
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:05,319
[SPEAKER_05]: are fucking geniuses.

448
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,401
[SPEAKER_05]: It is absolutely the best thing.

449
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:10,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the entry-level blender.

450
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:12,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get one that's more powerful than that.

451
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:14,565
[SPEAKER_05]: You can dispose bodies in that thing.

452
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:17,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, it's $250.

453
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:18,467
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's buying it.

454
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:19,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was like $600.

455
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:20,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was $600.

456
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:21,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be $600.

457
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:24,151
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be a restaurant-caliber thing.

458
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:25,072
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it used to be $600.

459
00:25:25,312 --> 00:25:25,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's $399.

460
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:27,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like the PS3.

461
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,575
[SPEAKER_05]: But it can be yours for four low payments of $99.99.

462
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:30,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Four low payments.

463
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like the PS3 or the iPhone.

464
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:33,057
Yeah.

465
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Nim in chat, chat.orangelandre.com if you're listening to us live on this Sunday evening says, Chuck Norris doesn't blend.

466
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:41,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Chuck Norris blends blenders.

467
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not start this.

468
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

469
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:46,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please let's not.

470
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:48,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to the next story quickly.

471
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:57,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, speaking of blending, someone I'd love to throw into that wonderful high-powered blender.

472
00:25:58,832 --> 00:26:02,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Senator Hillary Clinton and of course some other folks.

473
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:08,660
[SPEAKER_06]: The views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the station or other staff members of Orange Lingerie.

474
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,122
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are the majority of the studio.

475
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:28,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, Senator Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Sam Brownback, and even Bay, I guess, have sent letters to the ESRB asking for a thorough review of Manhunt 2 following the whole unlock

476
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:31,237
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, content, do the hacking the game.

477
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:41,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, apparently they think because they're like political types that the ESRB would go, okie dokie, we didn't do our job the first time or something.

478
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:58,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and actually, the other thing that they're also wanting, um, done is because they're a little bit pissed off with the whole Wii controls and how you can murder people using the Wii remote, they want the Wii games to be rated differently because of such things like that.

479
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:02,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So they want that taken into consideration for future ratings.

480
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know you can still aim a gun with a mouse.

481
00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:10,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Escapist in chat says, Sweet Jesus, is Manhunt 2 even selling that well?

482
00:27:10,937 --> 00:27:12,037
[SPEAKER_06]: My thoughts exactly.

483
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,578
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can tell you right now it's not.

484
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't understand the point of it.

485
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:21,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, doesn't fucking Hillary Clinton have better things to do?

486
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:23,041
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

487
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:23,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

488
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I heard she's running for president.

489
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:29,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope she wins!

490
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:30,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, doesn't she have better things to do?

491
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:33,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope she wins.

492
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:38,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I remember right, though, it's not just her, but she did band together with these other folks.

493
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:40,706
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a multi-partisan thing.

494
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:41,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, it's four people then.

495
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:46,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this goes back to the fact that politicians generally are a little bit ignorant about this stuff.

496
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:56,640
[SPEAKER_05]: See, this is what I don't understand is, you know, four letters from politicians and they want results, yet, you know, if I send them four letters to shut the fuck up, they're not going to do it either, so...

497
00:27:57,185 --> 00:27:58,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Why should they listen to them?

498
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:03,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe someone the ESRB should listen to is Mr. T!

499
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:16,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Because goddammit, everybody should listen to Mr. T. And if that is true, then everybody will soon own a copy of World of Warcraft because there are brand new commercials featuring Mr. T and William Shatner for World of Warcraft.

500
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:25,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're pretty... They're very interesting because, yeah, in the commercial, and I'm not going to play it because Blizzard isn't paying us to play it, but...

501
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:33,278
[SPEAKER_06]: In the commercial, Mr. T talks about how he fantasizes himself as a night elf mohawk, even though there isn't actually a mohawk in the game.

502
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:37,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And William Shatner is a shaman, a torn shaman.

503
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:39,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure, he's been nerfed to hell.

504
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:44,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Mini-Me has filmed a commercial as well.

505
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,727
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Vern Troyer has also filmed one.

506
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:48,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to God he's a gnome.

507
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:51,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You better believe he's a gnome.

508
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,029
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have to say.

509
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:52,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to God he's a gnome.

510
00:28:52,729 --> 00:28:55,810
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think they're going to do the ironic thing where he's going to play a very tall character.

511
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Make him a dry.

512
00:28:58,011 --> 00:28:59,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Lame.

513
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:01,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I already got Shatner as a tauren.

514
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:03,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

515
00:29:04,413 --> 00:29:08,835
[SPEAKER_05]: On a completely different note, Warcraft may be taking...

516
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Warhawk Operation Omega Dawn

517
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:41,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's going to be some nighttime base battles as well.

518
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:47,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Few cliched titles.

519
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's nice to see that they're expanding their games.

520
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:51,833
[SPEAKER_05]: What few they have.

521
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:53,814
[SPEAKER_05]: More power to them.

522
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:54,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

523
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:59,798
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of dumb titles out there in video gaming, so titles aren't everything.

524
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:02,640
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the gameplay that's going to be important in this expansion.

525
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I never played the first Warhawk, so...

526
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,540
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

527
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:06,980
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

528
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,761
[SPEAKER_06]: What did they say in chat room?

529
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:08,561
[SPEAKER_06]: They're already subverting it.

530
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:08,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Who?

531
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:10,242
[SPEAKER_08]: They're already subverting the call name.

532
00:30:10,282 --> 00:30:10,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Who and what?

533
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat room.

534
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:13,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Who specifically and what?

535
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:20,966
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Nim calling it Omega Dump, Sashiel Omega Dumb, Omega Dong, Omega Gong.

536
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:22,206
[SPEAKER_08]: How mature.

537
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:25,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Omega Penis.

538
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:29,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, did we just make our first penis joke?

539
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not the last.

540
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:39,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of jokes, the PlayStation 3 version of the Orange Box may be pretty hilarious.

541
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:44,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently... Thank you, Drew, for that very scary maniacal laughter.

542
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,641
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was that?

543
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:47,021
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my evil laugh.

544
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:49,322
[SPEAKER_06]: That apparently was the evil... Wow.

545
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:51,622
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the evil, I am laughing at you, PS3.

546
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:53,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little scared about this.

547
00:30:54,463 --> 00:30:54,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow...

548
00:30:55,726 --> 00:31:02,696
[SPEAKER_06]: The Orange Box is actually, it's not being ported by Valve, who were doing the PC and 360 versions.

549
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:07,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently another team at EA has taken upon it to actually port this game over to the PlayStation 3.

550
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:09,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And the early reports are saying...

551
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:12,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that great.

552
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:15,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they the team behind Superman Returns?

553
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:16,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God, I hope not.

554
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:30,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there are a number of frame rate hiccups and other technical issues which, quote, at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable.

555
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:38,142
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what's interesting is if you think about other things you might have read about, Gabe Newell, who's one of the co-founders of Valve, he's

556
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:39,125
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

557
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:54,753
[SPEAKER_06]: The Orange Box is a pretty awesome game, going off what I've heard.

558
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,034
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki certainly said a lot of great things about Orange Box.

559
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:58,995
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura loves her some Portal.

560
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:00,675
[SPEAKER_06]: She's gone freaking crazy with Portal.

561
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:04,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be playing Orange Box this week, though, because Loki's Lomi is copy, so I'll let you know next week.

562
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:10,979
[SPEAKER_06]: But whenever great games get disgraced like that, it makes us a little bit angsty.

563
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:15,181
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we get angsty, the FU music comes in and we do our rants.

564
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd actually like to start tonight because I'm reading chat.

565
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:38,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give an F you to Nim, who said, Omega, two girls, one cup.

566
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:39,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

567
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:41,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it go.

568
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, let it go on both ends of that.

569
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have anything else to really say F you to, so I guess you get that.

570
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,900
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to sleeping until one today.

571
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,280
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty awesome.

572
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:51,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

573
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,561
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to being sick.

574
00:32:55,961 --> 00:32:59,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuffed up and all the other fun stuff that goes along with it.

575
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:00,643
[SPEAKER_05]: F.U.

576
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:00,963
[SPEAKER_05]: to Loki's SARS?

577
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:01,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's not contagious.

578
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:54,874
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to people in Battlefield 2 who insist I fly a helicopter even though I have no idea how to fly a helicopter FU to not having all these wonderful PC games that are coming out lately and FU to not being able to feed my WoW addiction Well you just need to have Tank upload a program for you to learn how to fly a combat helicopter Ooh, points for the Matrix reference Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the FUs of the week

579
00:33:55,595 --> 00:33:57,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredibly nerdy, thanks to Drew being here.

580
00:33:57,596 --> 00:33:58,257
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

581
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:01,258
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having that guy, Joe Pantalone, I think, coming in.

582
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy that played Cypher.

583
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,761
[SPEAKER_05]: He's coming into our work.

584
00:34:04,861 --> 00:34:05,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that guy.

585
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:06,281
[SPEAKER_06]: He's that guy.

586
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:10,064
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really know his name, but in every mob movie, he plays a mob guy.

587
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:13,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Or he plays... Or he... No.

588
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:15,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened.

589
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,288
[SPEAKER_06]: He was in... What was that movie?

590
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:17,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Memento.

591
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:19,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he was in Memento.

592
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:25,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sopranos, and oddly enough, The Princess Diaries.

593
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't wanna watch this again!

594
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:52,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I still vote for the steak dinner.

595
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:52,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

596
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:16,001
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

597
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:37,257
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

598
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:39,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the actual company?

599
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm sorry, but this is the actual company.

600
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Developed by Champagne for the Ladies is the name.

601
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, this sounds right up your alley.

602
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:48,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Champagne for the Ladies?

603
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,562
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of a fucking development team is that?

604
00:35:52,462 --> 00:35:56,123
[SPEAKER_06]: This sounds like the candy that strangers use to get people in their cars.

605
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:57,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, oh, but it gets better.

606
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I got champagne for the ladies.

607
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:05,581
[SPEAKER_05]: It replaces all the boyish drug running and random violence with stuff girls like.

608
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:07,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Like experimenting with drugs.

609
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:08,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Using sex... What?

610
00:36:09,865 --> 00:36:12,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Using sexuality for personal gain.

611
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:16,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And clawing to the top of the social order by any means necessary.

612
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut the fuck up.

613
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is this from?

614
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:19,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this for real?

615
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:25,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's, um... You can gossip, shoplift... Shoplifting.

616
00:36:25,096 --> 00:36:25,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

617
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Game, you know, all sorts of things like that.

618
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:39,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, apparently, this being chat says, Grand Theft Auto, Ho Island.

619
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that's degrading.

620
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:42,982
[SPEAKER_06]: That's degrading.

621
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:46,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there's a report, though, on Canada.com.

622
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:48,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they're so cool, they have their own .com.

623
00:36:49,944 --> 00:36:54,826
[SPEAKER_05]: They're writing that while the Australian Family Association deems the game toxic,

624
00:36:55,978 --> 00:37:02,122
[SPEAKER_05]: and Christine Devitt of the Montreal's Concordia University calls it corrosive.

625
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:06,104
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not really a description for a game.

626
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Insert blame Canada judge here.

627
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:10,906
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the actual development name for the company.

628
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:14,148
[SPEAKER_05]: The folks at Champagne for the Ladies say it's all in good fun.

629
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:20,892
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I'm sorry, but no one's going to take a company named Champagne for the Ladies seriously.

630
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:23,273
[SPEAKER_08]: GS191 has an interesting point.

631
00:37:23,553 --> 00:37:25,034
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Winona Riders Simulator.

632
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:30,711
[SPEAKER_06]: This is more of like a Britney Spears simulator.

633
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Drugs ruin your life and all that stuff.

634
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:33,872
[SPEAKER_06]: My God.

635
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,053
[SPEAKER_06]: But, like, I don't know.

636
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:40,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me if it's just me, but isn't there, like, a sick side of you that, like, kind of wants to play it?

637
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:42,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll set it done.

638
00:37:42,455 --> 00:37:47,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm kind of like... You know, it's like one of those things, like, I have to play it, like, before I die.

639
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:48,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what?

640
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:49,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Take two.

641
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:51,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Pay attention to what they're doing in this game.

642
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:55,179
[SPEAKER_05]: That way you can add a female character into Grand Theft Auto that you can play.

643
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:56,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you go.

644
00:37:56,178 --> 00:37:57,320
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what women like.

645
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Women like using sexuality for personal gain.

646
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:00,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Pulling each other's hair.

647
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:02,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And doing all stuff like that.

648
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:04,251
[SPEAKER_08]: When Jamie's not here.

649
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:05,718
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what happens.

650
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Frisbee asks, what would Jamie's comments on this be?

651
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:33,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a clue.

652
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:35,645
[SPEAKER_06]: If we get her on the phone later, we'll have to watch.

653
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:36,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know.

654
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:41,130
[SPEAKER_06]: She would probably be making some sort of noise similar to this.

655
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, I think, what Jamie would do.

656
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:50,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Call me crazy.

657
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's get back into some real games.

658
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:57,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Such as a real gamer girl, Lara Croft.

659
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:00,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say that because Lara Croft has big boobs.

660
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,581
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just kidding.

661
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:06,343
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, Lara Croft is much more of a hero than any of the characters in that other game ever will be.

662
00:39:08,837 --> 00:39:13,960
[SPEAKER_06]: has come out with Tomb Raider Anniversary on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

663
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:17,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually available for 1,200 Microsoft points.

664
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,024
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to set you back about 15 bucks.

665
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:19,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, though.

666
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:25,428
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to own Tomb Raider Legend in order to play it because it's technically downloadable content for that.

667
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:28,410
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to download the Tomb Raider Anniversary, check that out.

668
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,331
[SPEAKER_06]: It's available on the Xbox 360 right now.

669
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think that's only the first half of the game.

670
00:39:33,053 --> 00:39:34,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be two halves.

671
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:35,334
[SPEAKER_05]: They're about 1,200 points each.

672
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:35,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

673
00:39:36,535 --> 00:39:37,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then there you have it.

674
00:39:37,896 --> 00:39:38,276
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh,

675
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:42,305
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't like that, you can spend an extra $10 and buy the disc.

676
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:46,607
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what's Lara Croft's equivalent of Horse Armor?

677
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:52,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Or better yet, just wait a few months because this game isn't that great to begin with and wait for the drop in price.

678
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Does download content drop in price that much?

679
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:56,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess so.

680
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:59,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought Carcassonne and it was free like four months later.

681
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:02,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about buying the disc version of the game.

682
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I gotcha.

683
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:07,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of Xbox Live stuff...

684
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:19,807
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live in Europe, they're going to be offering you, instead of Halo 3 for buying an Xbox 360, 10 free Xbox Live Arcade games for new European Xbox 360 owners and a friend.

685
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:22,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

686
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:26,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what you can do... Let's see.

687
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:37,353
[SPEAKER_05]: If you buy a console between October 1st and December 14th, you fill out a form and then both you and a friend can get 10 free Xbox Live Arcade games.

688
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:38,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And which...

689
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:40,577
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, aren't that bad.

690
00:40:41,198 --> 00:40:59,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty good selection, including Every Extent Extra Extreme, Sonic the Hedgehog, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting, Bomberman Live, Marble Blast Ultra, Spyglass Board Games, Small Arms, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures, Assault Heroes, and Zuma Deluxe.

691
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:01,216
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, it's free.

692
00:41:01,296 --> 00:41:01,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not bad.

693
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:03,166
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

694
00:41:15,817 --> 00:41:19,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, let's get into some release dates and talk about Europe first.

695
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:22,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's not here, but I've got you covered on what is coming out in Europe.

696
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:28,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And I imagine now that the holidays are over, things are slowing down in terms of release dates, but apparently not.

697
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:32,244
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a lot of stuff coming out on the 30th over in Europe.

698
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:40,308
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a port of Alvin and the Chipmunks, which is that, I'm sure, a translation of that, I'm sure, Oscar award-winning movie.

699
00:41:40,328 --> 00:41:41,148
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a music game.

700
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:42,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a music game for real?

701
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:45,190
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not karaoke, though, but it's a rhythm music game.

702
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:51,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but... You know, there's rhythm music games that are good, like DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero.

703
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there's these types of music games.

704
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,660
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't going to be one of them.

705
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

706
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Alvin and Chipmunks comes out on the 30th on the DS and the Wii.

707
00:41:59,181 --> 00:42:03,462
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackSci Area 51 makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360, also on the 30th.

708
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:07,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Boogie finally makes its way to Europe on PlayStation 2 and the DS this week.

709
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:09,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Cruisin' comes out on the Wii.

710
00:42:09,283 --> 00:42:10,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you can skip that.

711
00:42:10,683 --> 00:42:16,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Football Manager for the PSP comes out as well as Guitar Hero 3 comes out on the PC this week.

712
00:42:16,713 --> 00:42:24,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it already came out on the consoles last week because I've seen, yeah, it must have come out last week because I saw some British folks joining the OL Army.

713
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:27,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Jenga comes out on the DS on the 30th.

714
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:31,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Medal of Honor for the PSP also comes out on the 30th.

715
00:42:31,745 --> 00:42:34,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Pro Evo Soccer 2008 for the PSP also on the 30th.

716
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzle Quest comes out on the PlayStation 2.

717
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:40,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Resident Evil The Umbrella Chronicles on the Wii.

718
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:42,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Speedball 2 on the PC.

719
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:44,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Syphon Filter on the PSP.

720
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:47,090
[SPEAKER_06]: The Golden Compass on damn near every system.

721
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, another kind of gaming port of a movie.

722
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:55,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, but certainly not leastly, My Horse and Me on the PC.

723
00:42:55,902 --> 00:42:57,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Developed by Atari.

724
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And you wonder why their CEO recently left the company.

725
00:43:22,926 --> 00:43:24,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, and it's fucking full-priced?

726
00:43:25,947 --> 00:43:28,428
[SPEAKER_05]: We just stole $34 out of your wallet.

727
00:43:28,448 --> 00:43:29,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It's magic!

728
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:33,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if you're buying it from GameStop, it's full-priced, but it's supposed to be $20.

729
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:35,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Two words.

730
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:37,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Ping pals.

731
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:45,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Cranium Kabuki, if you like that trivia game, normally a board game, you can buy that from Ubisoft on the Wii.

732
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:49,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Boogie is coming out in the DS this week.

733
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:52,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Geometry Wars Galaxies on the DS.

734
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,412
[SPEAKER_05]: History Channel Battle for the Pacific on the Wii.

735
00:43:57,273 --> 00:43:58,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see.

736
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:04,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And Indoor Sports from Konami, although that's not coming out.

737
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,597
[SPEAKER_05]: That's next year.

738
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:13,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they list it as because we have some more current dates than they do.

739
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:15,702
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

740
00:44:16,249 --> 00:44:20,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really... I imagine it's probably a much slower week here, thanks to Black Friday being over.

741
00:44:22,211 --> 00:44:24,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Did anybody actually venture out on Black Friday?

742
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:28,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, like, later on in the evening.

743
00:44:28,253 --> 00:44:32,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to GameStop around 2 to pick up the Wings of the Goddess, and it wasn't that bad.

744
00:44:33,615 --> 00:44:35,876
[SPEAKER_06]: They were adequately staffed, I'll tell you that.

745
00:44:35,896 --> 00:44:37,496
[SPEAKER_06]: They had, like, people walking the floor and everything.

746
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:41,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and bought Zola and the Zapper.

747
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,498
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's weird, though?

748
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:42,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm?

749
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,603
[SPEAKER_05]: The Zapper, from what we've, you know, the press release said it was supposed to be $20.

750
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:53,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, my company, we're selling it at $20 retail.

751
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:55,349
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop's selling it for $25.

752
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:57,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, ho, ho.

753
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere.

754
00:44:58,051 --> 00:44:59,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

755
00:44:59,932 --> 00:45:00,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Shop around for the best deal?

756
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:02,994
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I spent $25 because I'm lazy.

757
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's wasted $25 right there.

758
00:45:07,217 --> 00:45:08,498
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we'll get into that later.

759
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:10,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get into some Japanese release dates.

760
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:17,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed comes out in Japan, the localized version for the Xbox 360 from Ubisoft.

761
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:21,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Apocalypse Desire Next is a new game on the Xbox 360.

762
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:26,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a strategy-based game, and it doesn't look like anything we have over here.

763
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trying to take a look at some screenshots real quick.

764
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:33,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it might be a tactical type of game.

765
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:35,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to look here.

766
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:39,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it's definitely more of a tactical-based type of game, so check that out.

767
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,608
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like those games, Apocalypse Desire next.

768
00:45:41,668 --> 00:45:45,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out this week in Japan on the Wii, Swing Golf!

769
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:52,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Panjia Second Shot is coming out, which I'm sure is just kind of Nintendo's version of Hot Shots Golf, or who are we trying to kid?

770
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:55,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just another rip-off of a Wii sports title.

771
00:45:55,732 --> 00:46:01,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out on the Wii, Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes on the Wii, coming out from Capcom.

772
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:06,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out in Japan, Tony Hawk's Project 8 on the PlayStation 3.

773
00:46:07,752 --> 00:46:12,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Train, Your Past Makes Your Future on the PlayStation 2 from Princess Soft.

774
00:46:14,117 --> 00:46:19,161
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can get a limited edition of that game as well if you follow every Princess Soft title.

775
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:27,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of princesses on the Nintendo DS, Disney Princesses Magical Jewels comes out in Japan.

776
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:31,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly what their magical jewels are, but I don't want to find out.

777
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:34,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats 2 comes out of the Nintendo DS in Japan.

778
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:36,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Another cat simulation game.

779
00:46:37,075 --> 00:46:42,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Because apparently Cats 1 with a Z, that's Cats with a Z, was so popular there is now a Cats 2.

780
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:49,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Fukumori, Mori No Unhappy Project is coming out from Bandai, also on the Nintendo DS.

781
00:46:49,938 --> 00:46:52,619
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have no idea what this game's all about.

782
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:55,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it could be another mix of minigames.

783
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to tell from the screenshots.

784
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an action-based game.

785
00:46:59,841 --> 00:47:01,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a typical platformer.

786
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:02,197
[SPEAKER_06]: What's so damn funny?

787
00:47:02,478 --> 00:47:02,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it chat?

788
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:03,918
[SPEAKER_08]: It's chat.

789
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:05,439
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they saying in chat, Drew?

790
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:07,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, typical DMN.

791
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Princess off.

792
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:09,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't Rob work for them?

793
00:47:10,101 --> 00:47:11,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha, funny.

794
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:16,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out on the PSP, Disgaea Hour of Darkness Portable.

795
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:20,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out, the portable version of the popular strategy game.

796
00:47:20,026 --> 00:47:22,147
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for Japanese release dates.

797
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:23,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

798
00:47:24,096 --> 00:47:36,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, one thing that's supposedly coming soon to the Wii, which is weird because I never thought it would, but the Unreal 3 engine is apparently being adapted for the Wii by some unnamed company.

799
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:41,072
[SPEAKER_05]: They're porting it over much like I guess they did with the Unreal 2 engine.

800
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:45,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Ubisoft ported over the Unreal 2 engine for Red Steel.

801
00:47:47,804 --> 00:47:48,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

802
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:51,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it coming over for Red Steel 2, maybe?

803
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I don't know.

804
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:54,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Because isn't the rumor that that game is supposed to be being made?

805
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:55,970
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

806
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:57,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it doesn't suck as much as the first one.

807
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:58,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe they can make it right this time.

808
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:00,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

809
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:01,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

810
00:48:01,675 --> 00:48:05,417
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you've heard my opinion on Ubisoft ports for Wii.

811
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:05,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

812
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:11,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to stay away from them.

813
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,832
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't know for sure it's them.

814
00:48:12,912 --> 00:48:18,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an unnamed company that's doing it, but it's just kind of one of those, you know, if you were betting, odds would favor this.

815
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:23,889
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think they could probably do it if they, you know, did something like Cell Shaded or something like that.

816
00:48:23,949 --> 00:48:26,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Very simple, like, you know, Wind Waker type graphics.

817
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:27,706
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

818
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:57,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they can sell that to other companies, you know, to make Wii versions of stuff using the Unreal 3 engine.

819
00:48:58,183 --> 00:49:06,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And plus, you know, with just the Wii selling as crazy as it is, you know, if you've probably seen the stories on Black Friday, people are still going crazy about the Nintendo Wii.

820
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, you know, it's kind of a different demographic.

821
00:49:09,388 --> 00:49:12,849
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the more family household, quote unquote, is where the Nintendo Wiis are going.

822
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:21,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So certainly if there is a particular game that they want to try and get a piece of that audience with that type of, you know, share the marketplace, they'll go for it.

823
00:49:23,214 --> 00:49:30,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's take this opportunity to dive into the mailbag and take a look at some of the emails that we've gotten this week.

824
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:34,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

825
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:41,303
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura will usually take on these responsibilities, but since she's not here, I stole the password to the mailbag and I'm looking in her place.

826
00:49:46,665 --> 00:49:48,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's look at email number one tonight.

827
00:49:49,306 --> 00:49:50,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Four emails we're reading tonight.

828
00:49:51,007 --> 00:49:52,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Email number one comes to us from

829
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:56,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Arvid, who didn't use a handle, so I called him by his real name.

830
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:57,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Arvid said, Greetings!

831
00:49:58,508 --> 00:49:59,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick question.

832
00:49:59,368 --> 00:50:03,069
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the song called that you play at the end of the show, and from what game is it?

833
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry if this has already been answered in the forums.

834
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,372
[SPEAKER_06]: The song at the end of the program that you will hear in a little while when we finish.

835
00:50:10,392 --> 00:50:14,333
[SPEAKER_02]: That's iFutureList by Akira Yamaoka, which I believe appeared in DDR...

836
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:24,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Supernova in the US for a console game.

837
00:50:24,971 --> 00:50:26,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was Extreme 2 also.

838
00:50:27,072 --> 00:50:27,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it in Extreme 2?

839
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:29,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was Supernova.

840
00:50:29,713 --> 00:50:33,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure one of the Bombani nerds in chat knows for sure, but it made its first appearance in one of the 2DX games.

841
00:50:34,436 --> 00:50:37,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say 2DX 13th?

842
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:39,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

843
00:50:40,058 --> 00:50:41,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I stopped tracking after 8th.

844
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It shows up in various Bombani games.

845
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:49,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the next email coming to us from Charred.

846
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Also known as Rick, the UK fanboy.

847
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:54,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, do you have a postage address?

848
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:58,025
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going through a mass tidy at our house and I have to throw out a lot of my stuff.

849
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:00,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I've come across some things that might be fun to send you.

850
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:01,649
[SPEAKER_06]: A Christmas present maybe.

851
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:03,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, maybe I'll... I like presents.

852
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:04,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I like presents.

853
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:09,698
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it's not a B-O-M-B, then I guess I'm okay with giving out the address.

854
00:51:10,198 --> 00:51:10,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

855
00:51:11,552 --> 00:51:14,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, sure, I'll reply to that and find out, but there's another part of this.

856
00:51:15,634 --> 00:51:16,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have read this on air if that was it.

857
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:17,935
[SPEAKER_06]: There is another part of this.

858
00:51:18,316 --> 00:51:19,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I also have a question.

859
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:24,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Which game were you so excited to get, and when it came out was the biggest disappointment?

860
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:30,862
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could go back in time and hit the developer over the head with a big comedy inflatable hammer, what would you get them to change?

861
00:51:31,542 --> 00:51:35,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheerio, Govna, Chimney, Cup of Tea, Telly, and all that stuff.

862
00:51:38,286 --> 00:51:40,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he is our UK fanboy, so... You forgot Crumpets!

863
00:51:41,288 --> 00:51:41,788
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

864
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Guilty Gear Dust Strikers DS Game

865
00:52:36,305 --> 00:52:37,246
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

866
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:06,792
[SPEAKER_08]: But they screwed up the fighting system, they screwed up the plot, and they made a joke of a last boss.

867
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:09,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy, easy, easy for me.

868
00:53:09,913 --> 00:53:14,054
[SPEAKER_06]: The game that was the biggest disappointment where I wanted to go back and smack the developers upside the head, Nintendogs.

869
00:53:14,754 --> 00:53:15,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember E3?

870
00:53:15,214 --> 00:53:17,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I freaking fell in love with this game.

871
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:21,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I said it's going to be the greatest game that comes out this year, and then when the game comes out, I was bored with it in an hour.

872
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:21,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Woof.

873
00:53:22,438 --> 00:53:26,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, because there was nothing really else to do besides those three contests.

874
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:31,880
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a lot of competitive stuff, and there wasn't much you could do with the dogs.

875
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I realized it was supposed to be a sim, but I don't know.

876
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:39,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking there would be more of a game to it, and there wasn't, and that was kind of sad.

877
00:53:40,082 --> 00:53:41,362
[SPEAKER_05]: How about We Connect 24?

878
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:43,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that count as a game?

879
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:43,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of.

880
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:46,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Crossing DS would be a close second for me, honestly.

881
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:54,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I was expecting so much more from that, and I think it felt more like a port than a sequel, and that was what was ultimately disappointing.

882
00:53:55,283 --> 00:53:55,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

883
00:53:56,143 --> 00:54:07,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the other disappointing thing about Nintendogs is the fact that it's been selling like crazy, and now we have all of these knockoff games to thank, such as like Cats 2, which I think we said earlier, Imagine Babies, all those stuff.

884
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:17,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see they had, what was it, a bundle, I think, through, I want to see maybe, it was like one of the big retail chains.

885
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:23,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was the Nintendogs, like that metallic red or rose DS.

886
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:27,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two or three other versions of Nintendogs.

887
00:54:27,115 --> 00:54:28,936
[SPEAKER_05]: You get like four of the same game.

888
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:29,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

889
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:31,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

890
00:54:32,538 --> 00:54:36,040
[SPEAKER_06]: DMNourishment said it was designed to be played like 15 minutes a day, Rob.

891
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,560
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want?

892
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then it got boring after two days.

893
00:54:39,581 --> 00:54:40,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that was the problem.

894
00:54:40,582 --> 00:54:42,023
[SPEAKER_06]: There was not a lot to come back for.

895
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:44,764
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a lot to kind of like earn or work towards in that game.

896
00:54:44,784 --> 00:54:46,165
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a freaking Tamagotchi.

897
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:47,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of.

898
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:48,467
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

899
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:13,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see how this is actually related to games, but that's how it is spun.

900
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:16,013
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ask me, the violent act was done solely for money.

901
00:55:16,353 --> 00:55:22,576
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that it was for four pounds sterling doesn't make it more tragic because the kid didn't know how much she had.

902
00:55:22,936 --> 00:55:30,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, he's sending us a link to the story about how, you know, let's see, boy murders old woman for game money.

903
00:55:30,438 --> 00:55:32,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and this is a story that was dug and everything.

904
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:38,832
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a 13-year-old kid in Vietnam robbed an 81-year-old woman, and he used the money to play online games.

905
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:39,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

906
00:55:40,453 --> 00:55:43,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously where Rob's kind of going is that, isn't this really about a robbery?

907
00:55:43,854 --> 00:55:45,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does it necessarily have to be about games?

908
00:55:45,295 --> 00:55:46,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares what they spent it on?

909
00:55:46,735 --> 00:55:47,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't me, I swear.

910
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:51,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but if he spent it on crack, it wouldn't have made the news.

911
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:57,339
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's sad that that woman got robbed, but we really want to know, what did he spend the money on?

912
00:55:57,419 --> 00:55:59,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get in the mind of this criminal.

913
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:01,298
[SPEAKER_05]: How did he spend that money?

914
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:05,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And then let's prove that gamers are completely worthless moral rejects.

915
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:18,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this, too, is that the story makes reference to the story from earlier this month when that kid beat up his mom over Halo 3 when she tried to take it away from him, like call the cops, that whole thing we read on a previous show.

916
00:56:20,185 --> 00:56:21,366
[SPEAKER_06]: They remind folks of that.

917
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:24,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's just call it bad parenting and leave it at that.

918
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:26,068
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your Jamie angle, I imagine.

919
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:28,854
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

920
00:56:57,563 --> 00:57:01,485
[SPEAKER_05]: My PS3 is being borrowed by a friend who likes Ratchet & Clank a lot more than I do.

921
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:02,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

922
00:57:02,846 --> 00:57:05,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's playing it, and he loves the game.

923
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:09,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a no, but... To be honest, I don't even think I want to play the game.

924
00:57:09,749 --> 00:57:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks fun.

925
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:11,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Ratchet & Clank.

926
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Why'd you buy it?

927
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:15,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order.

928
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:18,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I just said, fuck it, I'm going to pick it up because it's supposed to be a good game.

929
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:19,974
[SPEAKER_05]: You tool.

930
00:57:20,914 --> 00:57:21,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks good.

931
00:57:21,815 --> 00:57:23,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks fun, but no, it's just...

932
00:57:24,807 --> 00:57:27,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play any of the Ratchet & Clank games, and there's probably a reason for that.

933
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,051
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because I didn't want to play them.

934
00:57:29,331 --> 00:57:31,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And why the fuck did I buy the new one?

935
00:57:31,232 --> 00:57:34,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, because I'm desperate for good games for the PS3.

936
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:36,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And which you don't play.

937
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:47,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now I'm loaning it to a friend right now, because he's going to get his own PS3 soon, and probably when he does that, I'm probably going to sell him the game, so... Ranma says, Damn, Loki, you're sad.

938
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:51,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Dartitsuya says, Loki, do you think Mario Galaxy ripped them off, as they claim?

939
00:57:51,809 --> 00:57:52,049
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

940
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:53,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

941
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:55,456
[SPEAKER_06]: More of the email from Marissimo here.

942
00:57:55,836 --> 00:57:59,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, have you guys tried Super Stardust HD or any other PSN titles?

943
00:58:00,338 --> 00:58:05,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that even though the selection is pretty slim, most of the games are worth trying, especially if you've got a Japanese account.

944
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,481
[SPEAKER_06]: GT Prologue looks fucking amazing.

945
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:11,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for consistently putting on such great shows.

946
00:58:11,762 --> 00:58:12,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

947
00:58:12,883 --> 00:58:13,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

948
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:21,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a Japanese account, and I do play GT Prologue, and I still don't like Gran Turismo, no matter how pretty they make it, but that's just my personal preference.

949
00:58:22,307 --> 00:58:22,827
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks pretty.

950
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:25,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say it's any better than Project Gotham Racing 3.

951
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:28,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

952
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:37,546
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get the cars looking that good, it's not like leaps and bounds better than anything that's out there right now.

953
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:40,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have Flow.

954
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:41,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Flow's fun.

955
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:50,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, the only thing that's really stopping me from buying games on the PlayStation Network is I hate their fucking account system where you have to put money on this account and then

956
00:58:52,025 --> 00:58:58,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but even with Xbox Live Marketplace, you get a little bit of that, where you always have some points left over, you know?

957
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but at least there's stuff I can download on there.

958
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:07,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and also a lot of the download stuff that they have on the PlayStation Network is a little bit more expensive.

959
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:23,863
[SPEAKER_05]: or like less production value or whatever.

960
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:28,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's good stuff on there like Everyday Shooter and some of the stuff like that.

961
00:59:28,246 --> 00:59:31,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's nothing really that's jumped out at me other than Flow.

962
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:32,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Flow is kind of fun.

963
00:59:32,709 --> 00:59:33,529
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

964
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:34,090
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

965
00:59:35,131 --> 00:59:36,031
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

966
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:36,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's it for the mailbag.

967
00:59:37,152 --> 00:59:40,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, if you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

968
00:59:43,016 --> 00:59:43,296
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

969
00:59:43,676 --> 00:59:45,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, on to some other stuff.

970
00:59:47,201 --> 00:59:51,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it's no surprise that Super Mario Galaxy is selling well.

971
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:55,823
[SPEAKER_05]: It has sold 500,000 copies in the U.S.

972
00:59:56,243 --> 00:59:59,264
[SPEAKER_05]: in the first week alone, which is pretty awesome.

973
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:05,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it's probably going to be continuing to sell well all throughout the holidays.

974
01:00:05,946 --> 01:00:10,827
[SPEAKER_05]: We also know that it sold 250,000 units in Japan in its first week as well, so.

975
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:12,471
[SPEAKER_05]: HALO 3 HALO 3

976
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:32,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Teetered off, like, really quick, I think.

977
01:00:32,844 --> 01:00:34,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, it had a huge launch.

978
01:00:35,025 --> 01:00:36,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, everybody that had Halo 2.

979
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:39,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like, earlier in the show, I was talking about the whole MMO thing.

980
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:43,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in a way, it's kind of similar with fans, you know, hardcore fans of a series.

981
01:00:44,193 --> 01:00:46,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's going to be out there day one buying it.

982
01:00:46,474 --> 01:00:51,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine if Halo 3's multiplayer servers had gone down going, oh, sorry, we didn't think so many people would try to get on.

983
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is basically what, you know, Squeenix did with Final Fantasy.

984
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:57,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the difference is there's a single player element to Halo.

985
01:00:59,545 --> 01:01:00,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

986
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:01,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, anyhow.

987
01:01:01,777 --> 01:01:03,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you can play single player in Final Fantasy XI.

988
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:07,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That's funny.

989
01:01:07,479 --> 01:01:10,562
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new device out there called the Cyber Famulator.

990
01:01:11,082 --> 01:01:14,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows you to play your Famicom games on your DS Lite.

991
01:01:14,485 --> 01:01:17,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Also with this device, you can use a TV Out.

992
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:20,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, keep in mind that is a Famicom emulator.

993
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:21,692
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not actually an emulator.

994
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:22,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an actual device.

995
01:01:22,552 --> 01:01:25,635
[SPEAKER_06]: You put your DS on top of it and it does this whole thing.

996
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:31,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep in mind it's Japanese, so you can't use it for NES games.

997
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But just out of curiosity, is this something you guys would want?

998
01:01:36,612 --> 01:01:38,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you want it like it is now to play Japanese imports?

999
01:01:38,873 --> 01:01:43,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think it might be kind of cool to have something to use your old school NES cartridges on?

1000
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:45,136
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks kind of cool.

1001
01:01:45,156 --> 01:01:47,657
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like almost the DS version of the Super 8.

1002
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd get it just for nostalgia's sake.

1003
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:53,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish there was more you could do with it, kind of like with the Super Game Boy and stuff.

1004
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you could change the colors and all that dumb shit.

1005
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:57,642
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be cool if you could like, I don't know,

1006
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:58,651
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN Fuck Your Warranty FYI

1007
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:22,348
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point, if you're going to get something like this, and then some people still have warranties.

1008
01:02:22,368 --> 01:02:23,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would it fuck your warranty?

1009
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:27,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's something you have to attach there with... No, it just plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot.

1010
01:02:28,131 --> 01:02:28,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1011
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:32,153
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it's only on one screen, because it's plugging into the Game Boy Advance slot.

1012
01:02:32,173 --> 01:02:33,914
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably could fucking use it on a Game Boy Advance.

1013
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1014
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:36,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know... Oh, it's for the DS, I'm sorry.

1015
01:02:37,516 --> 01:02:37,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1016
01:02:38,077 --> 01:02:41,939
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's not like something you have to mod your system for, that'd be stupid.

1017
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:42,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1018
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways.

1019
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, let's see here.

1020
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:50,451
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually been a series that just started on TV, and I gotta mention this.

1021
01:02:51,212 --> 01:02:53,654
[SPEAKER_05]: The Discovery Channel's Rise of the Video Game.

1022
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually pretty good.

1023
01:02:54,715 --> 01:02:55,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched the first episode of it.

1024
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:59,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me if you've ever watched G4's Icon series that they have.

1025
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:05,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Very similar to that kind of thing, but it's, you know, kind of the whole history of video games.

1026
01:03:05,344 --> 01:03:11,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just started with, like, you know, the very first computer game to, you know, the 70s, like Pac-Man and

1027
01:03:12,341 --> 01:03:13,522
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that.

1028
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:14,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

1029
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:16,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And a really fascinating series.

1030
01:03:17,123 --> 01:03:23,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're going to replay the hell out of this all throughout the week, so I recommend catching it on TV or YouTube.

1031
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:28,709
[SPEAKER_06]: DMM would like to remind you that any third-party thingamajig not licensed fucks your warranty, apparently.

1032
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,752
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean I avoided my warranty by using a game gene in my NES?

1033
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:37,654
[SPEAKER_05]: How would they prove that you fucked it up by plugging it in there?

1034
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:40,275
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no physical evidence, they're not going to be like...

1035
01:03:40,774 --> 01:03:42,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, I sense residue from this thing.

1036
01:03:42,996 --> 01:03:44,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're not fucking CSI.

1037
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:46,480
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of dust on this.

1038
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,602
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go, my DS broke, you know, fix it.

1039
01:03:48,843 --> 01:03:49,663
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going to do it.

1040
01:03:49,864 --> 01:03:52,767
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be able to tell unless you actually broke it open.

1041
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:53,888
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll never know.

1042
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:55,249
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not CSI.

1043
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:56,571
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have the snappy one-liners.

1044
01:03:58,613 --> 01:03:58,913
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1045
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:00,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go...

1046
01:04:02,076 --> 01:04:05,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I actually want to ask real quick about the rise of the video game.

1047
01:04:05,057 --> 01:04:06,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something you actually watched?

1048
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:06,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.

1049
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:07,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good.

1050
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:09,940
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the format of it?

1051
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I forgot to TiVo it.

1052
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:15,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically a reminder, like I said, of the Icon series.

1053
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:24,167
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of discuss different things that went on, and then they would have developers and major key figures and stuff commenting on it.

1054
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:27,929
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the president of IGN, they had some of the...

1055
01:04:29,642 --> 01:04:54,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The creator of Pac-Man and stuff And they were talking about all the phenomenon, the pop culture stuff Related with video games And just the mentality and all that stuff They went and talked about Tetris It's just very well done It's a really cool series I think it's worth checking out The last documentary I watched on games was that PBS one That was in high def, it was kind of neat

1056
01:04:55,103 --> 01:04:57,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this, like I said, I love the Icon series.

1057
01:04:57,832 --> 01:05:01,985
[SPEAKER_05]: That was probably my favorite show on G4, but, you know...

1058
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:04,404
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1059
01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, this week's classic game of the week is a game called Equinox.

1060
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:46,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the classic game of the week.

1061
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:52,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Equinox was actually the sequel to another game on the NES called Solstice 2.

1062
01:05:52,831 --> 01:05:55,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'm sorry, Solstice was the game on NES.

1063
01:05:56,054 --> 01:05:58,797
[SPEAKER_06]: This was kind of Solstice 2 in many ways.

1064
01:05:59,237 --> 01:06:04,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of the reason I like totally dig this game is the fact that it was kind of like...

1065
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the ambience and the music in this game.

1066
01:06:07,382 --> 01:06:08,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It really set the mood.

1067
01:06:08,823 --> 01:06:13,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, you have this isometric view of the game.

1068
01:06:13,927 --> 01:06:16,388
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't played Solstice on the NES, it was very similar.

1069
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You had this isometric view of the game.

1070
01:06:21,512 --> 01:06:25,555
[SPEAKER_06]: You were going through these dungeons and trying to solve all these different puzzles in the game.

1071
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:30,620
[SPEAKER_06]: The ambience that the music set was just, like, awesome.

1072
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And you got these different items, and you had to fight the bosses, and it had, like, really cool boss music in the game.

1073
01:06:36,506 --> 01:06:43,032
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, ironically, one of the things that was really cool about Equinox was that it was actually developed by Sony.

1074
01:06:44,114 --> 01:06:48,418
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the Sony spin-offs companies, Sony ImagineSoft, was actually the company that made this game.

1075
01:06:48,718 --> 01:06:51,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was kind of like Sony making a game for the Super Nintendo.

1076
01:06:52,782 --> 01:06:52,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Equinox

1077
01:07:10,621 --> 01:07:12,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It required a hell of a lot of patience.

1078
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:16,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It had kind of a steep learning curve, but it was a little fun once you got used to it.

1079
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:16,365
[SPEAKER_06]: It did.

1080
01:07:16,605 --> 01:07:19,947
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a real steep learning curve to it, and it was fucking hard.

1081
01:07:19,987 --> 01:07:27,572
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing about it is that it had a really precise way to kind of get through the game, and it was not very forgiving in regards to running into people and stuff.

1082
01:07:27,893 --> 01:07:29,173
[SPEAKER_06]: You pop up on the overworld.

1083
01:07:29,193 --> 01:07:35,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's maybe the YouTube guy playing it on an emulator or something, but why the fuck is all the text in front of... Because it's a demo.

1084
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:36,678
[SPEAKER_05]: You're looking at a demo.

1085
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:37,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1086
01:07:37,459 --> 01:07:37,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1087
01:07:38,078 --> 01:07:40,439
[SPEAKER_08]: You pop up on the overworld and within two minutes you're dead.

1088
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:41,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's tough.

1089
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:42,421
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough.

1090
01:07:42,441 --> 01:07:43,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there were little bosses around the overworld.

1091
01:07:43,782 --> 01:07:46,083
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this game was actually originally developed to be an RPG.

1092
01:07:46,123 --> 01:07:52,227
[SPEAKER_06]: If you actually look on YouTube, you can find YouTube clips of this game as like an RPG.

1093
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:55,469
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually see like text that was cut from the game.

1094
01:07:55,929 --> 01:07:57,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So, kind of interesting the way it's set up.

1095
01:07:58,277 --> 01:07:58,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

1096
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:06,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And being asked in chat room, DMN under the guys, your mom, says, Rob, will this be on virtual console?

1097
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say, Lordy, I hope so.

1098
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:09,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

1099
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:13,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, you'll be bringing in a classic game next week in Jamie's absence, correct?

1100
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:13,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1101
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,001
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1102
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:16,572
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, this is the part of the show then.

1103
01:08:16,752 --> 01:08:17,812
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a short show tonight.

1104
01:08:17,852 --> 01:08:21,514
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to cram it all into one segment, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype lines.

1105
01:08:21,834 --> 01:08:28,656
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1106
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:30,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And folks have been hammering the phones already.

1107
01:08:30,737 --> 01:08:32,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we already have a call on the line.

1108
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:34,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Caller, are you there?

1109
01:08:35,099 --> 01:08:35,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Rob.

1110
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:36,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1111
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this Jamie?

1112
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:38,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

1113
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Jamie.

1114
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:40,101
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

1115
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:43,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the rain right now.

1116
01:08:43,773 --> 01:08:44,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it raining where you're at?

1117
01:08:45,714 --> 01:08:46,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it's raining.

1118
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:47,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1119
01:08:47,855 --> 01:08:50,717
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure... I am... I'm sorry, I know you're... Oh, go ahead.

1120
01:08:50,737 --> 01:08:53,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just saying, I'm calling from Alabama.

1121
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:54,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how has things been going out there?

1122
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:55,580
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your Thanksgiving?

1123
01:08:57,081 --> 01:09:03,465
[SPEAKER_03]: We had it yesterday, and Mom cooked for a small army, but thankfully a small army showed up, and then they went off to kick butt for me.

1124
01:09:04,486 --> 01:09:04,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1125
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:07,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was pretty cool, and...

1126
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:08,391
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1127
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:27,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that movie's cool.

1128
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Hypercube and Cube Zero, which I'm supposed to be watching while I'm here.

1129
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:48,357
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

1130
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:01,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much else, you know.

1131
01:10:01,982 --> 01:10:05,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost logged into Ragnarok once at this Wi-Fi place that we found.

1132
01:10:06,384 --> 01:10:06,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1133
01:10:06,964 --> 01:10:07,944
[SPEAKER_03]: To check my vending.

1134
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:09,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't.

1135
01:10:09,064 --> 01:10:09,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I resisted the urge.

1136
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:16,066
[SPEAKER_06]: If I sounded a little distracted during the Classic Game of the Week segment, that's because I was actually trying to pick up Jamie's call.

1137
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:18,707
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was curious, did you hear the Classic Game of the Week segment?

1138
01:10:18,907 --> 01:10:20,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I pick a worthy game this week?

1139
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:22,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say you picked Psychonauts?

1140
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was Equinox, which was Solstice 2 on the Super Nintendo, basically.

1141
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:31,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that wasn't on Super Nintendo.

1142
01:10:33,299 --> 01:10:34,399
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, Equinox.

1143
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

1144
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Equinox, which was much, well, I like Psychonauts 2.

1145
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say it's much cooler, but it was a very cool game, so.

1146
01:10:43,104 --> 01:10:43,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1147
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:46,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just curious if I picked a worthy game this week.

1148
01:10:47,475 --> 01:10:48,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say you did.

1149
01:10:48,176 --> 01:10:48,916
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good one.

1150
01:10:49,236 --> 01:10:50,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1151
01:10:51,017 --> 01:10:52,638
[SPEAKER_03]: You gave my stamp of approval.

1152
01:10:53,519 --> 01:10:54,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good.

1153
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:55,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always looking for that.

1154
01:10:56,481 --> 01:11:00,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, tell Jamie a little bit about the story we covered earlier in the evening.

1155
01:11:01,283 --> 01:11:04,985
[SPEAKER_06]: There's apparently a girl Grand Theft Auto type of game coming out.

1156
01:11:05,045 --> 01:11:06,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki, what is it you can do in this game?

1157
01:11:07,027 --> 01:11:08,407
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do drugs.

1158
01:11:08,888 --> 01:11:12,770
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also have sex with people for your own personal gain.

1159
01:11:14,047 --> 01:11:16,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Spread Rumors, stuff like that.

1160
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:18,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this sound like the female Grand Theft Auto to you?

1161
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:20,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing drugs and pulling people's hair?

1162
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:22,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no.

1163
01:11:22,892 --> 01:11:29,575
[SPEAKER_03]: See, my perfect version would be like this hardcore chick with like an... We actually just got done watching Planet Terror, so it would be Rose McGowan.

1164
01:11:29,975 --> 01:11:34,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and it's developed by a company called Champagne for the Ladies.

1165
01:11:35,138 --> 01:11:36,078
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so stupid.

1166
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,521
[SPEAKER_06]: What about... Wait, who would be cooler, Rose McGowan or Tank Girl?

1167
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a hard one.

1168
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:46,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hard, hard one.

1169
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:50,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Tank Girl's pretty hardcore, but she has to have the tank.

1170
01:11:51,013 --> 01:11:51,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

1171
01:11:53,234 --> 01:11:55,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they should just make a Tank Girl video game, honestly.

1172
01:11:55,975 --> 01:11:56,816
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

1173
01:11:56,956 --> 01:11:58,616
[SPEAKER_06]: They were going to, and it got cancelled.

1174
01:11:59,257 --> 01:11:59,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't!

1175
01:11:59,637 --> 01:12:00,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Stuart has to do all the artwork.

1176
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:02,198
[SPEAKER_05]: On the original PlayStation.

1177
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:02,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

1178
01:12:04,065 --> 01:12:06,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already been challenged by a Wii Zapper.

1179
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:07,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It fell on my foot before I left.

1180
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:08,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually watching Eddie Izzard right now.

1181
01:12:08,709 --> 01:12:09,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then go enjoy the Eddie Izzard.

1182
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:30,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, take care.

1183
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye everybody.

1184
01:12:32,491 --> 01:12:32,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1185
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:34,212
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you when we get back in two weeks.

1186
01:12:34,753 --> 01:12:35,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1187
01:12:36,514 --> 01:12:40,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie was very patient waiting on hold while I was doing the classic game of the week, so I appreciate that.

1188
01:12:40,697 --> 01:12:42,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to the phones again.

1189
01:12:42,418 --> 01:12:47,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you can call or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

1190
01:12:47,121 --> 01:12:48,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1191
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:48,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1192
01:12:49,422 --> 01:12:50,503
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Raven Stolfen.

1193
01:12:50,543 --> 01:12:51,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Raven Stolfen.

1194
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:52,004
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

1195
01:12:52,985 --> 01:12:53,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I am okay.

1196
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:54,926
[SPEAKER_09]: A little cramped in here.

1197
01:12:55,266 --> 01:12:55,927
[SPEAKER_09]: A little cramped?

1198
01:12:56,967 --> 01:12:58,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my house is being renovated.

1199
01:12:58,706 --> 01:12:59,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you have control over it?

1200
01:12:59,927 --> 01:13:01,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you just say, Hey!

1201
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:01,688
[SPEAKER_09]: No more orange boxes!

1202
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:32,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried, and then they go like, no, we gotta play Portal.

1203
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:33,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Portal's awesome!

1204
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they're like, Team Fortress is awesome.

1205
01:13:35,672 --> 01:13:37,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm like, you haven't played it very much.

1206
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:39,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yeah, it's very hardcore.

1207
01:13:39,775 --> 01:13:40,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's very hardcore!

1208
01:13:41,557 --> 01:13:43,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Offer them a cake if they shut up.

1209
01:13:43,558 --> 01:13:49,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, now, so did you just call in tonight to bitch about your own show's politics, or what's the deal?

1210
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:50,383
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, not at all.

1211
01:13:50,604 --> 01:13:52,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what else is up?

1212
01:13:53,045 --> 01:13:54,967
[SPEAKER_06]: You talked about Portal and all those games.

1213
01:13:55,754 --> 01:13:56,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's true.

1214
01:13:56,194 --> 01:13:57,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really played them still yet.

1215
01:13:57,575 --> 01:13:59,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like the least coolest kid on the block.

1216
01:13:59,595 --> 01:14:00,315
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're just like me.

1217
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1218
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're in the same boat.

1219
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:05,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, except Loki, one of the cool kids on the block, is loaning me his copy.

1220
01:14:05,977 --> 01:14:12,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe by next week I'll be sitting here giggling going, hee hee, the cake is alive, hee hee hee, you know, and all that stuff that everybody else is doing.

1221
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:14,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1222
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:18,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think, does this kind of stuff kind of irritate you when people go too far?

1223
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It pisses me off.

1224
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:20,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1225
01:14:20,821 --> 01:14:21,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1226
01:14:21,181 --> 01:14:24,582
[SPEAKER_09]: It pisses me off, especially when a commercial that goes the greatest game of all time.

1227
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:25,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1228
01:14:26,631 --> 01:14:31,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And with the PlayStation 3 version being very unplayable, Gabe Newell must really hate that thing.

1229
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:37,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there's not a lot of nice things to say about it from Valve.

1230
01:14:38,535 --> 01:14:38,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

1231
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:42,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Technically it's like, I hate the PlayStation 3.

1232
01:14:42,176 --> 01:14:43,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to gimp it.

1233
01:14:45,317 --> 01:14:46,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently a lot of folks are doing that.

1234
01:14:48,578 --> 01:14:50,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, any final thoughts for our listeners, RavensDolphin?

1235
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:54,300
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but don't be in a cramped room.

1236
01:14:54,793 --> 01:14:55,433
[SPEAKER_06]: ZENICOR ZENICOR ZENICOR

1237
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:27,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Same old stuff, different day, man.

1238
01:15:27,408 --> 01:15:27,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

1239
01:15:28,509 --> 01:15:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your gaming week been like?

1240
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:31,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, first off, did you have a good Thanksgiving?

1241
01:15:32,772 --> 01:15:34,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got turkey for days, dude.

1242
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:35,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1243
01:15:35,594 --> 01:15:36,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Leftovers.

1244
01:15:36,175 --> 01:15:38,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Turkey and then turkey everything for a whole week.

1245
01:15:39,477 --> 01:15:42,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing but turkey and sleeping for the next half week or so.

1246
01:15:42,559 --> 01:15:43,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

1247
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So how was your gaming week?

1248
01:15:44,201 --> 01:15:45,321
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we owe the call to tonight?

1249
01:15:46,382 --> 01:15:49,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've been getting all of my November 20th gaming out of the way.

1250
01:15:49,685 --> 01:15:52,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So I finally managed to finish Assassin's Creed and saw the...

1251
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:53,300
[SPEAKER_04]: O.M.G.

1252
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:53,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoilers!

1253
01:16:12,754 --> 01:16:14,334
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1254
01:16:40,891 --> 01:16:43,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like they already know there's going to be an Assassin's Creed at some point.

1255
01:16:43,313 --> 01:16:44,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they were talking about the sequel.

1256
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:45,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

1257
01:16:45,394 --> 01:16:45,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1258
01:16:46,154 --> 01:16:47,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you've been playing, Xenocor?

1259
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:48,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1260
01:16:48,776 --> 01:16:50,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been getting Mass Effect out the way.

1261
01:16:51,117 --> 01:16:51,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, how is that?

1262
01:16:51,978 --> 01:16:53,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I have yet to check that out.

1263
01:16:53,098 --> 01:16:55,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very curious about Mass Effect.

1264
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:02,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Loki, did you play the beta version or the demo version they had at the trade shows, or did you actually play a full version of it?

1265
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:03,965
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I played a full version of it.

1266
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:05,386
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, because...

1267
01:17:06,053 --> 01:17:12,156
[SPEAKER_04]: After the review I heard last week, I'm not sure if you were playing the same game I am, because there wasn't that much talking before I started shooting anyway.

1268
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:13,697
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there was quite a bit of talking.

1269
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:15,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree.

1270
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:19,440
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I'm used to Bioware stuff, so I guess I sort of gloss over it.

1271
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,622
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I didn't play anything from Bioware.

1272
01:17:21,642 --> 01:17:23,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play Jade Empire or anything like that.

1273
01:17:23,603 --> 01:17:26,584
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, maybe this... I could have been nitpicking.

1274
01:17:26,644 --> 01:17:28,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have 30 minutes of my lunch, and I just want to kill me.

1275
01:17:29,026 --> 01:17:30,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, there you go.

1276
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:34,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, hey, 25 minutes of that lunch has spent talking...

1277
01:17:36,866 --> 01:17:38,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You missed alien sex.

1278
01:17:39,207 --> 01:17:39,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't miss it.

1279
01:17:39,987 --> 01:17:41,668
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no fucking alien sex in there.

1280
01:17:41,728 --> 01:17:43,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It's implied sex.

1281
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:45,369
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bullshit.

1282
01:17:45,429 --> 01:17:49,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki says fucking lifetime TV implied sex is what that is.

1283
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Penetration or it didn't happen.

1284
01:17:52,511 --> 01:18:00,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I can't confirm or deny that right now because apparently, based off how far I've gotten into the game, the scene they show isn't from a party member.

1285
01:18:00,813 --> 01:18:01,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from an NPC.

1286
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:04,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there is some party member...

1287
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:06,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll eventually get around to playing it.

1288
01:18:06,911 --> 01:18:10,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just right now there's, like you said, too many things to play.

1289
01:18:10,612 --> 01:18:11,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get rid of some of this, like,

1290
01:18:31,178 --> 01:18:32,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you play a lot of RPGs, Xenocore.

1291
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:34,641
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about the conversation style in Mass Effect?

1292
01:18:34,661 --> 01:18:35,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it really cool?

1293
01:18:35,481 --> 01:18:37,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it something you'd like to see in more games?

1294
01:18:47,694 --> 01:18:48,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1295
01:19:07,529 --> 01:19:07,709
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1296
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:08,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, I'm like Loki.

1297
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play the previous games.

1298
01:19:10,211 --> 01:19:11,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be good in a Star Trek game.

1299
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:12,513
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, guys?

1300
01:19:12,754 --> 01:19:20,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I need to introduce you to Knights of the Old Republic, to Neverwinter Knights, to Jade Empire, all these bioware games that you haven't played.

1301
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,361
[SPEAKER_06]: None of those games I've played.

1302
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:22,422
[SPEAKER_06]: None of those games I've played.

1303
01:19:22,442 --> 01:19:22,902
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to.

1304
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:31,870
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just too... You know, and I gotta say, and I realize there's a lot of folks listening to this show think we're experts on everything, but, you know, we're gamers just like you guys, and we don't have time for everything.

1305
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:35,133
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely want to at least look at everything if I have a chance.

1306
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:40,779
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I miss E3, because at E3 you could at least look at everything and kind of go, yeah, I'm more interested in this, or I'm not so interested in this.

1307
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:46,040
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, Xenocor, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1308
01:19:46,841 --> 01:19:49,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just one other point on Mass Effect.

1309
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:50,921
[SPEAKER_04]: The rover kicks ass.

1310
01:19:51,382 --> 01:19:54,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Warthog is shit now.

1311
01:19:54,742 --> 01:19:58,123
[SPEAKER_04]: The Land Rover you get to use in Mass Effect is the new ride I want, man.

1312
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1313
01:19:59,941 --> 01:20:02,943
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much detail put into the way that vehicle just operates.

1314
01:20:03,063 --> 01:20:05,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just drive it all day on the planets and stuff.

1315
01:20:05,165 --> 01:20:05,485
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1316
01:20:06,086 --> 01:20:06,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1317
01:20:07,227 --> 01:20:14,853
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of interesting hearing about a lot of big games of the year getting compared to Halo 3, where it looks like Halo 3 may not be the game of the year.

1318
01:20:14,913 --> 01:20:20,638
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all these other games that are doing these other little things, whereas a lot of folks kind of thought Halo 3 may take the crown.

1319
01:20:20,658 --> 01:20:21,819
[SPEAKER_06]: It may not, but we'll see.

1320
01:20:21,999 --> 01:20:24,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's because it's Halo 2.5 and not Halo 3.

1321
01:20:24,221 --> 01:20:24,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1322
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:27,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Omega 5 is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.

1323
01:20:55,135 --> 01:20:56,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for a kick-ass shooter.

1324
01:20:57,337 --> 01:21:01,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, that's not the same thing as the Omega Warhawk expansion.

1325
01:21:01,779 --> 01:21:02,000
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1326
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Omega 5.

1327
01:21:03,661 --> 01:21:06,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Hudson shooter.

1328
01:21:06,943 --> 01:21:07,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1329
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:08,624
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1330
01:21:09,324 --> 01:21:10,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1331
01:21:10,645 --> 01:21:11,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1332
01:21:11,706 --> 01:21:12,106
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

1333
01:21:12,246 --> 01:21:13,247
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Dillinger.

1334
01:21:13,487 --> 01:21:14,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Dillinger.

1335
01:21:14,127 --> 01:21:18,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually Ryoma, but I kind of felt like a name change.

1336
01:21:18,806 --> 01:21:20,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, hey, you know what?

1337
01:21:20,447 --> 01:21:22,249
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's your nickname, you have the right to do that.

1338
01:21:22,509 --> 01:21:26,031
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a little bit quiet, so make sure you get a little closer to your mic and tell us what's on your mind.

1339
01:21:27,473 --> 01:21:30,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I wanted to talk a bit about Mario Galaxy.

1340
01:21:30,955 --> 01:21:34,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I've basically been playing it over the entire Thanksgiving break.

1341
01:21:35,438 --> 01:21:40,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got to say that if you've got a Wii, you have to buy this game.

1342
01:21:40,883 --> 01:21:45,386
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of childish, and it's a bit easy at the beginning.

1343
01:21:45,902 --> 01:22:15,346
[SPEAKER_01]: but once you really get into the game especially the later stuff like you only have to have it's another one of the you have to or there's 120 stars that you can get and you only have to have 60 to go to the final boss but the final 60 is just it is better than everything else in the game it is better than a lot of the stuff in Mario 64 in my opinion there's some really innovative stuff in there I think that Mario Galaxy is basically the definite game to get for the Wii

1344
01:22:16,115 --> 01:22:20,738
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's kind of interesting because I can hear the excitement in your voice when you're talking about games.

1345
01:22:21,018 --> 01:22:24,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you hear that excitement, it makes other people excited.

1346
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:29,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So certainly I liked the bits of Mario Galaxy that I have played so far.

1347
01:22:29,564 --> 01:22:31,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't bought the full game yet, but I'm kind of curious.

1348
01:22:32,305 --> 01:22:34,887
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think about the motion in that game?

1349
01:22:34,947 --> 01:22:37,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Meaning like, you know how it was more of a round environment?

1350
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:43,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of thought it was a game where I'd be able to get disoriented very easily, even more so than most 3D games.

1351
01:22:43,753 --> 01:22:44,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you find that?

1352
01:22:44,573 --> 01:22:45,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, was it kind of hard to...

1353
01:22:48,896 --> 01:22:51,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

1354
01:22:52,156 --> 01:22:54,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that you get used to it after a bit.

1355
01:22:55,097 --> 01:22:57,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've had a couple of friends over that have played it.

1356
01:22:57,418 --> 01:22:58,418
[SPEAKER_01]: My brothers played it.

1357
01:22:59,258 --> 01:23:04,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little weird in the beginning, obviously, because you're getting used to this whole new orientation.

1358
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,860
[SPEAKER_01]: But after a little bit, you really get used to it.

1359
01:23:09,501 --> 01:23:10,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you tried any of the co-op mode?

1360
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:12,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know you said you had your friends over.

1361
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:15,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed in a commercial I saw the other day, they were really hype in the co-op mode.

1362
01:23:15,302 --> 01:23:15,662
[SPEAKER_06]: How is it?

1363
01:23:16,377 --> 01:23:18,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Co-op isn't really anything great.

1364
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:23,841
[SPEAKER_01]: All that you can do is you can move your Wiimote around and you can collect the stars for them.

1365
01:23:24,362 --> 01:23:26,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can stun the enemies.

1366
01:23:26,423 --> 01:23:27,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually you can make them jump.

1367
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:31,186
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great because you can really mess around with your friends.

1368
01:23:31,526 --> 01:23:34,948
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll likely try to jump somewhere and you can tell them to jump earlier.

1369
01:23:35,348 --> 01:23:38,330
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty stupid, but it's good for a laugh.

1370
01:23:39,608 --> 01:23:40,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1371
01:23:40,649 --> 01:23:43,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on the Wii that you're looking forward to this holiday season?

1372
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:44,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides Super Mario?

1373
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:44,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Trauma Center.

1374
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:46,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge Trauma Center guy.

1375
01:23:46,812 --> 01:23:48,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved Second Opinion.

1376
01:23:49,253 --> 01:23:50,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I never played the DS one.

1377
01:23:50,533 --> 01:23:52,134
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold my DS before it came out.

1378
01:23:53,135 --> 01:23:56,316
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really looking forward to New Blood.

1379
01:23:56,336 --> 01:23:59,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's already out, but I also really want to get Geometry Wars.

1380
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:06,801
[SPEAKER_01]: I played it once at my friend's house on Xbox on the 360 off of the Live Arcade or whatever the hell it's called.

1381
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:08,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was

1382
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:11,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I vaguely remember you guys doing an interview in Part B of 251

1383
01:24:39,338 --> 01:24:42,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember if it was that or what, but yeah, it's somewhere in there, so check it out.

1384
01:24:42,902 --> 01:24:44,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, what was the other thing I said?

1385
01:24:44,143 --> 01:24:53,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Trauma Center is a game I like as well, and that reminds me, that's something I want to look at, too, is the new Trauma Center game, because it's not just a DS port, like it was actually made for the Wii, so I'm excited about it.

1386
01:24:53,412 --> 01:24:54,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard it got great reviews.

1387
01:24:54,453 --> 01:24:55,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm excited, I've got to check that out.

1388
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Force is the greatest band ever.

1389
01:24:57,265 --> 01:24:57,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean,

1390
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:31,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I freaked out when I heard that they were going to be in Guitar Hero 3 even though I can't be through the fire and the plan's an expert.

1391
01:25:32,047 --> 01:25:32,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Rock on.

1392
01:25:32,968 --> 01:25:33,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

1393
01:25:33,388 --> 01:25:34,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Force is amazing.

1394
01:25:35,069 --> 01:25:35,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want them on the show.

1395
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:36,631
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1396
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:38,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that'll be my Christmas present.

1397
01:25:39,193 --> 01:25:39,513
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1398
01:25:39,613 --> 01:25:40,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great.

1399
01:25:40,614 --> 01:25:41,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well take care, Dillinger.

1400
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:43,016
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice to have you on the program.

1401
01:25:43,636 --> 01:25:43,997
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1402
01:25:44,357 --> 01:25:49,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And have fun with Mario Galaxy and good luck in getting all those 120 what-have-you stars that are in that game.

1403
01:25:50,222 --> 01:25:50,863
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nuts.

1404
01:25:51,683 --> 01:25:53,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other last-minute stories you got for us, Loki?

1405
01:25:54,706 --> 01:25:54,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1406
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,194
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one I forgot.

1407
01:25:56,214 --> 01:25:58,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't make show role for some reason.

1408
01:25:58,135 --> 01:26:02,759
[SPEAKER_05]: But Knights Journey into Dreams is coming to the PlayStation 2.

1409
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:06,041
[SPEAKER_05]: The original Knights that was on the Saturn.

1410
01:26:06,582 --> 01:26:06,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1411
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:10,725
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think probably didn't make the show role because we had a short show tonight.

1412
01:26:10,805 --> 01:26:12,747
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm glad that's what I didn't put on there.

1413
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:15,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So, oh, well, then I forgot.

1414
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:17,511
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do remember reading that, though.

1415
01:26:17,611 --> 01:26:18,251
[SPEAKER_06]: So very cool.

1416
01:26:18,671 --> 01:26:20,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to one more call for tonight.

1417
01:26:20,533 --> 01:26:21,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1418
01:26:21,394 --> 01:26:21,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1419
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:26,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Caller, are you there?

1420
01:26:27,153 --> 01:26:28,313
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1421
01:26:28,674 --> 01:26:29,654
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're there, say hello.

1422
01:26:29,674 --> 01:26:35,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

1423
01:26:38,558 --> 01:26:39,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Caller's not there.

1424
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:43,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, folks, you want to use Echo 123 to test your connection before you give us a call.

1425
01:26:44,061 --> 01:26:45,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can just use a regular telephone as well.

1426
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:46,742
[SPEAKER_06]: That always works.

1427
01:26:50,424 --> 01:26:53,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Always got to love when the last call of the night is something that fails.

1428
01:26:55,819 --> 01:26:58,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's go ahead and wrap up.

1429
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,761
[SPEAKER_06]: On that note, let's wrap up the show tonight.

1430
01:27:02,862 --> 01:27:05,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to do our challenge on Op 11, yes?

1431
01:27:05,123 --> 01:27:06,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do our crossbow challenge?

1432
01:27:06,403 --> 01:27:06,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you're welcome.

1433
01:27:06,983 --> 01:27:07,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1434
01:27:07,924 --> 01:27:09,624
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1435
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:11,145
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no other last-minute stories?

1436
01:27:11,345 --> 01:27:12,085
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no last-minute stories.

1437
01:27:12,145 --> 01:27:13,446
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1438
01:27:13,486 --> 01:27:14,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew, thanks for filling in tonight.

1439
01:27:15,307 --> 01:27:18,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry you got robbed of half a show, but come back.

1440
01:27:19,321 --> 01:27:19,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I am impressed.

1441
01:27:20,162 --> 01:27:20,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that...

1442
01:27:32,162 --> 01:27:32,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I need my WoW!

1443
01:27:32,843 --> 01:27:33,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

1444
01:27:59,994 --> 01:28:02,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel hot and I hope I don't have a fever because that would suck.

1445
01:28:04,657 --> 01:28:07,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought is I want more pumpkin pie.

1446
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:12,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I want pumpkin coffee and pumpkin everything.

1447
01:28:12,061 --> 01:28:13,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I want pumpkin everything.

1448
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:15,203
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want.

1449
01:28:16,144 --> 01:28:16,444
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1450
01:28:17,349 --> 01:28:21,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for tuning in, supporting Orange Lounge Radio and downloading us this week.

1451
01:28:21,152 --> 01:28:25,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, there is no Part B this week, but we will be back next week with a full show.

1452
01:28:25,955 --> 01:28:29,137
