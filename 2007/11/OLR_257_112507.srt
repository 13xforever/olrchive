00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Tonight, November 25th, 2007, Guitar Hero gets sued for sounding too good, Super Mario Galaxy

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,880
has super sales, and Captain Kirk officially endorses World of Warcraft.

3
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,800
Hello everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,080
We are that video game program dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,520
culture and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,880
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me not tonight is Dark Sakura, she has the night off, she's

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,320
off for the holidays in Alabama.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,760
We might hear from her a little bit later though, we'll see.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
But joining us in studio, say hello to the one and only Loki.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Hello.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,680
How you doing, Loki?

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
I'm doing fine.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,440
Alright, and since we had an extra seat tonight, we thought we'd bring back a familiar guest.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,320
For those that have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for some time, say hello to intern

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,720
Drew is here tonight.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
What's up guys?

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
How you doing?

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Ah, fair.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Good.

20
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,760
So Drew, since Dark Sakura's not here tonight, we are going to be relying on you to present

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,700
the female perspective of gaming.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,400
Wouldn't that be your job, Rob?

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
No.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
What are you trying to imply?

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Trying to say something?

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Oh, nothing.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Nothing at all.

28
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
That's what I thought.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Alright.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Let's get it started tonight.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,600
We're going to talk about how is your gaming week, and since Jamie's not here, we'll start

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,160
with Loki.

33
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Well, let's see.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,520
My gaming week was not filled with Rock Band.

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,080
You'd be surprised I didn't really play Rock Band this week, and instead, like Guitar Hero

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,420
and all the other music games before them, they are sitting in a nice bundle in a box

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,480
or whatever in the corner of the room while I play other things.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,800
We played actually some Project Gotham Racing 3 this week, and we did a little multiplayer

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
on that.

40
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Wait.

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Project Gotham Racing 3?

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
3.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
Old school.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,400
Well, it's the reason why we played that one instead of 4 is because I have five copies

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,240
of Project Gotham Racing 3 and not five copies of Project Gotham Racing 4.

46
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,280
It makes it a little difficult to play that game multiplayer otherwise.

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,760
Anyways, so we did that, and then scenes were, of course, as usual, and a little bit of Call

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,960
of Duty 4 multiplayer, which is fun, a little bit of Catan, because that's also fun, and

49
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,960
then the game I've been mainly playing the last few days is Zelda Phantom Hourglass,

50
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:40,880
because originally I had DS, and then it was a nice silver fat one that came out at launch,

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,840
and then the music came on and everything went to hell.

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
I sort of got everything's broken tonight.

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,920
Those who were listening live tonight, we had to do three retakes to start the show

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
tonight.

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
It's like Jamie's not here.

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
It all falls apart.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
I don't know what the hell's going on.

58
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Sorry.

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
Here we go again.

60
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:03,100
Anyways, so then, let's see, so yeah, basically I ended up trading my silver DS fat for a

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:12,160
pink DS Lite for my wife, and then I bought a non-pink DS Lite for myself, a black one,

62
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,160
so now I have my true official game for myself, because my wife has claimed all the other

63
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
ones.

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,040
What else did I play this week?

65
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,200
I think that's about it, really.

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,960
I haven't been playing too much stuff.

67
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,320
I imagine because of the holidays and all, everybody's gaming weeks was a little bit

68
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
abbreviated.

69
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,440
Did you have a good turkey day?

71
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,240
Yeah, we had two turkeys.

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
A pig?

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
No, no, no.

74
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Show off.

75
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,120
We did not eat two turkeys.

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,440
We had two turkeys.

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
I see.

78
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
One of them was at the table.

79
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,920
No, we had, because it's an interesting story.

80
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,640
We had things given over at Nellie's parents' house, and they had bought a turkey, and then

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Nellie's dad won a turkey at work.

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,960
The ironic thing is he doesn't like turkey, but he won one anyways, so they had two turkeys

83
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
there.

84
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,760
You know, that's funny, because I don't like turkey either, so they always have to make

85
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
ham.

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600
You know, turkey's not bad, it's just like, I don't want to, you know, they were trying

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,120
to feed me tons of that turkey, and I'm like, fuck this, I'm not eating all that.

88
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh, then they wanted me to carve the turkey, and I'm like, I don't know how to fucking

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
carve a turkey.

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,120
I'll give them my best try, but shit.

91
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,520
So yeah, that was my gaming week.

92
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,520
Nice.

93
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Drew, Intern Drew, you want to go next?

94
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Sure.

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,360
Well, I haven't been playing much World of Warcraft since my subscription expired, cry,

96
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,560
but surprisingly I've been involved in FPS.

97
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,080
I've been playing Battlefield 2 and getting my ranking up all the way to Sergeant so far,

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
which is kind of cool, I like playing a medic.

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,900
Other than that, second playthrough of Tales of Symphonia, catching in some Twilight Princess

100
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,880
and a little Wild Arms 4, not much spectacular, but it's fun stuff.

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,680
Alrighty.

102
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,280
My gaming week, let's see, I've been playing the brand new Final Fantasy XI expansion,

103
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,840
Wings of the Goddess, which, dear Square Enix, I mean, you really blew it with this, I mean,

104
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
I don't know what to say, now the game itself is cool, let me get to that in a minute, I'm

105
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,040
talking about the launch, okay, when you have an MMO, and you're going to launch an expansion,

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,220
you can expect that all your freaking players who are addicted to this game, especially

107
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,960
Final Fantasy XI people who are pretty rabid about Final Fantasy XI are going to be in

108
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,720
on this game trying to register the game, you can expect they're going to all be on

109
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
it once, and so what happens?

110
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,240
Their registration servers go down when it's time to get people on this game, is that literally

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,420
I'm sitting there having to click retry over and over and over again for like a half hour

112
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,680
and nothing happens, and that's the point where I'm like, Rob, this is really sad, you're

113
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
sitting here clicking your retry button over and over, and can't register the game, what?

114
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
Stuck at authenticating.

115
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,320
Well, basically, it was just, lots of people were hammering the servers and it was basically

116
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,760
breaking it, but I mean, you could do it.

117
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,480
Or they just thought that your copy was not authentic enough.

118
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,600
No, well, I'm looking right at it, does this not look like the real deal, hello?

119
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,360
That looks like the real deal forgery to me.

120
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,680
Here's the other thing, is that the PC version of the game was delayed, the game was supposed

121
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
to hit shelves on Tuesday, no, shipped Tuesday to shelf Wednesday, right?

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,920
And then what happens, the PC version gets delayed by a day, which means that in reality

123
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,640
it didn't come out on Thanksgiving, obviously, it came out on Black Friday, Rob, what?

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,160
What Final Fantasy game would it be if it weren't delayed a little bit?

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,720
But the fun thing is, it was only the PC version in the US that got delayed, so everybody's

126
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,040
playing Dancer and Scholar, all the people in Japan and Europe playing the new classes,

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,400
and all the PC players are just, hmm, tear.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,480
But I mean, this is how rabid people are, okay, you look at the Final Fantasy XI forums,

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,960
and people are like, okay, here's what you can do.

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,080
You can go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game, this is a real threat I saw on

131
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,640
Wednesday, the workaround, go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game, use the key

132
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,120
to register, if you can get through the registration server, download a torrent of the European

133
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,320
PC version, and then hack the initialization file to make the European game think it's

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
the US.

135
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
That's the workaround.

136
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
That's what people were doing.

137
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
That's the workaround.

138
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
That's a workaround.

139
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
That is a hell of a workaround.

140
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Or you just fucking wait.

141
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,640
I swear to God, you just wait.

142
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Fucking addicts.

143
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Just wait your turn.

144
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,920
We have to wait for our loud extension.

145
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,680
This is what I finally decided to do, was wait, but I guess people are still having

146
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
problems getting on there.

147
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,160
I did finally get my copy registered yesterday, I guess they fixed some servers, but they

148
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,720
kind of botched the launch.

149
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,240
As for the game itself, I was kind of hoping for a little bit more for the users that are

150
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,920
not at the end game level yet, like me, because I've been playing this game for how many

151
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,680
years yet, I can never seem to level a job past like 55 because I have extreme ADD.

152
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,660
Well, that and all the fucking level cap quests suck.

153
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,600
But I've got to say, with all the changes they've made to Final Fantasy XI, they've

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,320
made a lot of changes for the better.

155
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,100
They've made items not so impossible to get in many ways.

156
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,200
The economy's eh, but I don't know.

157
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,720
I think the game's made a lot of improvements, like classes have gotten changes that needed

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
it.

159
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,320
And the new classes are pretty cool, Dancer's pretty awesome and helps with small parties

160
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
and Scholar's kind of cool too.

161
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,640
You mean I don't have to compete with bots to get a freaking pair of lizard boots anymore?

162
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,920
Well, they're Rari X now, so it does them no good to camp Lizzie, because the boots

163
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,560
are Rari X, so if they get it, they can't sell it.

164
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,120
I would camp it and drop the boots just to piss people off.

165
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,760
That'd be awesome.

166
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,400
That's a lot of time though, you call me sad for clicking retry over and over.

167
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,560
You should play well, they'd welcome people like you.

168
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,600
I don't have time to do that stuff, I mean come on, look at my gaming week.

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,960
Let us go to the chat room for some comments, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,320
Rama says the World of Warcraft fans are probably just as bad, Rob.

171
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,440
I bet to some extent yes, but at least I don't remember Blizzard like buckling under pressure

172
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,100
when Burning Crusade launched.

173
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,080
They knew, okay, six million people are going to be registering the game today.

174
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,540
And I think they did alright.

175
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,600
I seem to remember when WoW first launched, they kind of had some bumps, but I guess they

176
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,040
didn't realize how big the game was going to be.

177
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Huge.

178
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Yeah.

179
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,520
Anyhow, the game itself, I need a little more time to explore the new areas, but I like

180
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
some of the new music and some of the old areas I went into.

181
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Did they add any new areas?

182
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,960
Well, they're the old areas 20 years ago, so there's different mobs, and it's not the

183
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,800
exact same thing with different colors.

184
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,680
For instance, one of the areas I traveled to in the past, Roland Barry Fields, you go

185
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,440
to it in the past and you see like destruction, because it's supposed to be like 20 years

186
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,020
ago when the war was going on, the Crystal War was going on.

187
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,960
You see destruction, like there'll be holes in the path where it looks like cannonballs

188
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,100
have struck the path, and things like that, so it's not like the exact same thing with

189
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
different colors.

190
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,240
Can you go to the towns and stuff on there like that, too?

191
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,280
You can't go to Juno, but apparently you can go to the other big three, Sandoria and Winderset

192
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
and all that.

193
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Yay, caverns of time.

194
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,920
Yes, but the Crystal War thing was written in the 11 story long before WoW was out, so

195
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
you can't say they did off WoW.

196
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,040
Yes, watch the intro movie sometime.

197
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,080
I know, but they've had that in since Warcraft II.

198
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Can't we have both?

199
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Isn't there room for both?

200
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,120
Why's it always got to be WoW versus whatever?

201
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
There's room for both.

202
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm playing both right now, and not much else because of it.

203
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,080
That's because you're a double addict.

204
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,080
But I did play Rock Band, and I bought Rock Band.

205
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,960
I did not spend $170 on the Deluxe Bundle, because I just knew, like after our preview

206
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,280
last week, I was like, you know, I just don't think I'm going to want to go through the

207
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,080
setup of setting up the drums and everything this much.

208
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,080
As much as I love that guitar, I thought the guitar was a great controller, I'm kind of

209
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,320
pissed off that the companies can't play together.

210
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,480
Like, you know how that guitar won't work with Guitar Hero?

211
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
It will.

212
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,800
I heard there was some compatibility chart I saw.

213
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Only on Playstation 3.

214
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Only on PS3.

215
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Well, that's actually a fuck of a lot of good.

216
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,160
Actually, if I remember correctly, I think it was, I want to say the Rock Band ones weren't

217
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,520
working on Guitar Hero 3 or something like that.

218
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,080
All I know is that the Guitar Hero 2 controller works with both, so I'm like, you know what,

219
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
I'll just continue to use that.

220
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,880
Even though my yellow button is starting to stick a little bit, I'll just use that.

221
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,400
Because the Rock Band songs aren't particularly hard.

222
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,040
Like I notice I'm doing way better on hard level on Rock Band than I do in Guitar Hero.

223
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,280
But I think that's just because I think it's a little bit better of a learning curve than

224
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,600
Guitar Hero, because like, in the hard difficulty on Rock Band, I notice they add the fifth

225
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,880
button, but they don't use it a lot, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero.

226
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,520
So you get some time to adjust to that.

227
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
I don't know.

228
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,840
Because your pinkies are weak.

229
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,500
Yeah, I haven't had as much problems adjusting to Rock Band at all.

230
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,320
But to be honest, I've only explored single player mode.

231
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,500
I have yet to make a band, so I have yet to explore that mode.

232
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,680
So I can't really give a full review on the game, other than I've enjoyed what I've seen

233
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
so far.

234
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,280
That's because you don't have any friends, because of how unlikable you are.

235
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,200
I want to be able to make a band for single player.

236
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,640
Like I want to be able to make my bandmates, you know?

237
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,080
That's what I was under the impression that's what you were going to be able to do, was

238
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,360
to make your own bands, and make your characters, and you can play each one individually, and

239
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
then have them all come together, but I guess not.

240
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Because there would be no bass man.

241
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Yeah, because there's no bass single player mode, which I was surprised to find out too.

242
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,740
So I guess there's little places they can improve.

243
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,480
But I love the presentation of Rock Band.

244
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,080
I love the way it looks, and how your characters get integrated into the loading screens.

245
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,480
I think that's hilarious, so very cool.

246
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,360
Other than that, not a whole lot else I've been playing because of Thanksgiving and all,

247
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
and mine was great.

248
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Thanks for asking.

249
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Very small.

250
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,200
We did not have two turkeys like at Loki's house did.

251
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
All right.

252
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,840
Well, that being said, let's go to some housekeeping for tonight before we get into the gaming

253
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
news tonight.

254
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,720
First thing we should say is that we're only going to be one part tonight.

255
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,160
There's not going to be a part B this week, reason being that because of the holidays,

256
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,960
because of Jamie's absence, and there just really wasn't a lot of gaming news this week,

257
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
so we decided we'd just make it a short show.

258
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,680
Apparently a lot of folks didn't think we were going to be on at all, and maybe that's

259
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,360
because I thought I said at the end of last week's show we were going to be here after

260
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
all, but maybe not.

261
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
I don't know.

262
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,120
So I know we were kind of going back and forth, so we are here this week, but only for one

263
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
part.

264
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
There will not be two parts to this week's show.

265
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,440
However, I do believe in lieu of a part B, I believe the Wee Zapper Challenge is happening

266
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
tonight.

267
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Yes.

268
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Yes.

269
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,680
So after the show, and of course this will be archived, we will be doing the Wee Zapper

270
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,080
Challenge where Loki has said that he does not need the Wee Zapper to do good in a game,

271
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,800
so he's going to play with just the normal emote.

272
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,160
I will be using the Wee Zapper, and whoever gets the higher score or what have you.

273
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,480
I don't know.

274
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,360
If I win, you have to take me out.

275
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,240
If you win, I have to take Nellie out, but what if she won't go out with me?

276
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
I don't know.

277
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
All right.

278
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Then I'll buy you guys dinner or something.

279
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
We'll just think of something.

280
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
How about this?

281
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
We'll make it a lot easier.

282
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,280
If I win, you get me a $20 gift card to some place, restaurant or something, and if you

283
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,920
win, I'll give you a $20 gift card to some place or something.

284
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
All right.

285
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
That makes it easy.

286
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Loser wears the tingle outfit.

287
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,520
No, I don't think so.

288
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,120
Well, there would have to be a tingle outfit first off.

289
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
No.

290
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
We will make one.

291
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
No.

292
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
I will get Ken to make one.

293
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
You kids know better.

294
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,280
You know the tingle outfit is reserved for one million copies of Eye of Judgment sold.

295
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Ready?

296
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
Go.

297
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Still waiting.

298
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Still waiting.

299
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
I still haven't seen the MPD.

300
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,640
I actually have seen the MPD numbers come over for October, but I believe the Eye of

301
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,280
Judgment was just within that.

302
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,240
Although, in a few more weeks, we'll have the MPD numbers for November, and I'll let

303
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,040
you guys know where Eye of Judgment is standing as far as sales go.

304
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640
On its way to a million in six months.

305
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Yeah, right.

306
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Sounds good.

307
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
All right.

308
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,000
Chat, who said you guys could come up with what the terms of the bet are?

309
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,680
Now, the chat is expressing some disappointment because they were looking forward to the Loki

310
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Rob date.

311
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Have I won?

312
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
I'll work something out.

313
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,280
I'll make them buy me dinner still.

314
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
Don't worry.

315
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
All right.

316
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,480
So, stay tuned for that after the show tonight.

317
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,520
That's really all I got for housekeeping other than, you know, stay on top of our communities.

318
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,360
We love having more folks on our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal

319
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,120
and our MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.

320
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,680
I always neglect to mention Facebook, but we do have a group on there at the OL Army,

321
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,200
so just search for OLRMY.

322
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,400
You'll find it, or Orange Lounge Radio will come up as well.

323
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,440
Sorry, Facebook, but there's just so goddamn many apps on Facebook.

324
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,520
Every day I'm getting some freaking request for, like, so-and-so wants to play Vampire

325
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,680
with you and suck your blood.

326
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
I'm like, bleh!

327
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Sorry.

328
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
It's like, yeah.

329
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
Thanks, Drew.

330
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
All right.

331
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
So, there you have it.

332
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,080
Also, the Guitar Hero OL Army fell out of the top 100 this week, and that makes me a

333
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
sad panda.

334
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,440
So, we need more recruits for the Guitar Hero OL Army.

335
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,560
You can find us on GuitarHero.com.

336
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,320
You can just search for OL Army.

337
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,080
However, I will say that Richie Maniac still has the number one spot on my Xbox Live list.

338
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,160
He's on my list, and he's on the Guitar Hero OL Army, and he has, like, a million groupies.

339
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,040
Damn you and your achievement horse.

340
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,320
I think he has 2,500 groupies, which is definitely the highest I've seen, so good job.

341
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,520
All right.

342
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,040
Let's get into some gaming news, then.

343
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,680
Who's gonna start us off tonight?

344
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Loki?

345
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Yeah.

346
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
I'm gonna start us off.

347
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,640
Anyways, as we kind of teased in the intro there, the Romantics, a wonderful 80s band,

348
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:15,160
I guess, I'll, yeah, I'm being sarcastic there, they are suing over a cover version

349
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,180
of their song, What I Like About You, that appeared in Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s,

350
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,520
because apparently, the song sounds too much like them.

351
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:34,120
They want the game sales to be halted, and want accounting of all profits from the game,

352
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,640
along with unspecified compensation and punitive damages.

353
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,000
So apparently, their claim is that the song is virtually indistinguishable from the authentic

354
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,800
version, and therefore would confuse the consumer.

355
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:59,720
But, you know, I don't know, it's like, I'm just thinking, if it's virtually indistinguishable,

356
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
then what's it matter?

357
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,640
It sounds like crap, and people are thinking that's the real song.

358
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,880
And after that, they're going to sue everyone who five stars on an expert.

359
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,400
You know, I would think that in the court of law, it's gonna come down, and the judge

360
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,160
is gonna say, can't we just all agree that this song is so 20 years ago, and you all

361
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,560
need to get over it?

362
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Or the fact that they probably paid to have the licensing of that song, because I'm sure

363
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,880
even though they didn't get the real artist to sing it, they have the license, the rights

364
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
to the song.

365
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,360
Do you think it's one of those cases where, like, the record company signed it over without

366
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
them knowing?

367
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Like, that type of thing?

368
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
Well, I'm not surprised there.

369
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Exactly.

370
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,120
Didn't a similar thing happen in DDR?

371
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Um, possibly.

372
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,760
Someone was saying, like, Strictly Business, but I don't see how that, that's a licensed

373
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,760
song off of, um, well, the thing was, well, the thing was Strictly Business is that the

374
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,320
original artist of the song never consented to the song being in the game, and one of

375
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,560
the artists went into an arcade one day and saw people playing the song, and was like,

376
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,860
what the hell is this?

377
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,680
We never said the song could be in the game, so it was, but the record company did it.

378
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,160
You know, Rob, they didn't raise much of a fuss when it was in, uh, Karaoke Revolution

379
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Party.

380
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Interesting.

381
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,200
And again, it wasn't a very good cover.

382
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,200
And plus, Karaoke Revolution doesn't quite have that pop culture recognizability that

383
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Guitar Hero does.

384
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,440
Let's actually listen.

385
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Let's hear some clips.

386
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,100
Here's the original version of What I Like About You by The Romantics.

387
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
It's buffering.

388
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
It's a little slow.

389
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay, that song's still kind of fun.

390
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
I have to admit.

391
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll bounce up and down.

392
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,600
All right, let's listen to what the cover sounds like.

393
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,080
This is by The Wave Group, and you actually can't get this in iTunes.

394
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,560
I'm just getting the clips actually right out of iTunes as well.

395
00:18:49,560 --> 00:19:09,400
You know, I've got to say, it really does sound a lot similar.

396
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
No, it doesn't.

397
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
A little bit.

398
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,520
A little bit.

399
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Not even close.

400
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Pursuing over that?

401
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
What a crock.

402
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,920
Well, let's see.

403
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Let's see.

404
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,240
Now, keep in mind, there's other bands that cover this.

405
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
So I just had a curiosity.

406
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,320
Just like a control, like when you're doing a science degree, you have to have a control.

407
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,400
So let's actually take a look at a completely different cover.

408
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,400
So from the band Kid Pop Rock and Roll Hits, here's the hit crew with What I Like About

409
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
You.

410
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Oh, shit.

411
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
It's buffering.

412
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Here we go.

413
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:59,360
I know, honestly, that's pretty similar too.

414
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,720
I thought Kidz Bop was reserved for cage match punishment.

415
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Make the wording stop.

416
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
That wasn't Kidz Bop.

417
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
That was not Kidz Bop.

418
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
It was Kidz Pop.

419
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Same damn thing.

420
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Big difference.

421
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
That's a big fucking difference.

422
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,880
That's a P, not a B. I would also like to point out, ok, I've got one more for you

423
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
guys.

424
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,520
This song was also covered on an album called The Barbie Hit Mix.

425
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,600
See, that's Barbie singing.

426
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,280
Ok, I have one question.

427
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,280
How effective is this mic as a bludgeoning instrument of death?

428
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,840
Honestly, the guitars and everything sound very similar.

429
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,400
Why does Barbie look like one of the Olsen twins?

430
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm wondering too.

431
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,040
I'm looking at the cover of this going, wow, Barbie got really slutty.

432
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,760
So there you have it.

433
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Got really slutty?

434
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,120
Nim in chat says, Barbie is made of plastic, no mouth.

435
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
How does she talk?

436
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,240
Same in the way Britney Spears does, you know, all in the same circumstances.

437
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,400
I'll give you a hint kids, it's the devil.

438
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,520
So there you have it.

439
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,400
They're being sued and what do you think, Drew, what do you think, is there any weight

440
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
to this lawsuit?

441
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,920
Do you think the romantics have a claim here or what?

442
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,920
No.

443
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,560
No, it is not even remotely similar.

444
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,280
It's similar as me singing this song, okay, I mean, seriously.

445
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Oh, oh, would you?

446
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
No, I won't.

447
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Sorry, Rob.

448
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
You will.

449
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,280
No, it's just, it's stupid.

450
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,800
I say yes, it's similar, but at the same time, somebody who had the rights to this song agreed

451
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,280
to let the song in the game.

452
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,240
I don't, now, if it came out that, you know, the developers got no permission to use this

453
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,840
song whatsoever, then I would say they have a case, but seeing as I'm pretty sure they

454
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,560
got the rights somewhere, you know, whether that be they went directly to the record label

455
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,200
and never approached the band, well, then the band should take that up with the record

456
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
label.

457
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,640
Why are you signing our stuff over to video games that are going to remake our songs too

458
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,140
similarly or why didn't you just let them use the original version for more money or

459
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,140
what have you?

460
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,400
I think, you know, if the song was licensed, then go QQ some more romantics.

461
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,440
Or perhaps the band should have a more unique voice that can't be copied so easily.

462
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,800
What the fuck is wrong with that?

463
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,280
DMN Nourishment says in chat, bottom line, sue the record company for signing and not

464
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Activision.

465
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,640
Stop fucking whining.

466
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,040
Nim says there's a difference between similar and same.

467
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,200
If it's a cover, then it's different and they are going to be made a fool of.

468
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,720
Escapist says I want to see Loki pop advertised on late night TV.

469
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,160
And Riddink 360 says Loki should sing it in the Tingle costume.

470
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,960
There you have it.

471
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,320
Lots of love for Loki singing.

472
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,680
I think you could put out an album that would be bigger than Shatner.

473
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,600
I don't want to do that.

474
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,280
Well, not that I could tell you where he can find clips on the internet of Loki singing,

475
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,760
but I'll give you a hint.

476
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,080
Rock band is the topic of our next story and we did something with rock band very recently.

477
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,680
Anyhow, rock band has opened up a store.

478
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
That's right.

479
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,040
There's a new store with accessories.

480
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,120
There's a whole drum bag you can actually buy on this story.

481
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,480
It's a $50 bag to basically keep that whole drum set in.

482
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
I want that.

483
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,040
It is kind of nice, but it's $50.

484
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I don't care.

485
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I want that.

486
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Is it worth $50, though?

487
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
It is worth $50.

488
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Do you know why, though?

489
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,800
Because have you ever tried buying a bag for, like, consoles?

490
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,440
Trust me, I have numerous times.

491
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,880
Those fucking backpacks that they have for the Xbox 360 are, like, $70.

492
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,380
It's fucking ridiculous.

493
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
That looks nice.

494
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,920
Yeah, I got to admit, it does look kind of nice, but I don't know.

495
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,440
I mean, like, God, you already spent $170 on the game.

496
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,480
Do you really need to spend $50 more on some stupid characters?

497
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Well, they have.

498
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
Like, you can buy actual guitars on that website and shit, like...

499
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Yeah, I know.

500
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
There's other memorabilia.

501
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,800
It's like, I just bought $169 worth of fake instruments.

502
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,160
Let's buy some real ones, too.

503
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
Yay!

504
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,280
Uh, by the way, before we get to the next story, speaking of Guitar Hero, a little more

505
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,480
Guitar Hero, a little less rock band, did you see that thing?

506
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,280
And Tiger Claw was sharing this with our forum people, and he was asking me about this before

507
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
the show.

508
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
Did you see that whole Guitar Hero in the blender thing?

509
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
I love that website.

510
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,520
They put down the Will It Blend?

511
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
They've done Guitar Hero.

512
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
That is the question.

513
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,520
And they actually put the controller in the blender.

514
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,960
Well, half of it.

515
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,040
I don't mean to pose spoilers, but yes.

516
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,480
Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.

517
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,680
I love that website now.

518
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
You should check that out.

519
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,080
I giggled my head off watching that.

520
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Rob.

521
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,760
I like how Loki used the appropriate verb.

522
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,000
He didn't laugh.

523
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,600
He giggled when he watched Will It Blend.

524
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Rob?

525
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Yes.

526
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,200
They did put Chuck Norris in the blender on that segment.

527
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,680
Like a cardboard cutout or something?

528
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Action figure.

529
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,480
Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.

530
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,680
I apologize to all listeners for bringing up Chuck, but it had to be done.

531
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,240
I'm telling you, Hail Marys, those people that are behind the marketing of that blender

532
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
are fucking geniuses.

533
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,040
That is absolutely the best thing.

534
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,620
That's the entry level blender.

535
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,560
You can get one that's more powerful than that.

536
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,640
You can dispose bodies in that thing.

537
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,640
It's $250.

538
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,640
No one's buying it.

539
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Everyone's watching it.

540
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
I thought it was $600.

541
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
It used to be $600.

542
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,160
It could be a restaurant caliber thing.

543
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,680
No, it used to be $600 and now it's $399, just like the PS3.

544
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:34,240
But it can be yours for four low payments of $99.99, just like the PS3 or the iPhone.

545
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,560
Nim in chat, chat.orangelandrager.com, if you're listening to us live on this Sunday

546
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,040
evening says, Chuck Norris doesn't blend.

547
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,000
Chuck Norris blends blenders.

548
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,460
Let's not start this.

549
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
I'm sorry.

550
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Yes, please.

551
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,460
Let's not.

552
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,800
Let's move on to the next story, quickly.

553
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:56,960
Anyways, speaking of blending, someone I'd love to throw into that wonderful high powered

554
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,480
blender, Senator Hillary Clinton and of course some other folks like Joe Lieberman.

555
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,720
These opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the station or other staff

556
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,800
members of Warren's Laundry.

557
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,160
But they're the majority of the studio.

558
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:20,080
Senator Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Sam Brownback, and even Bay, I guess, have sent

559
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:28,040
letters to the ESRB asking for a thorough review of Manhunt 2 following the whole, you

560
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:33,480
know, unlocked content, do the hack in the game.

561
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,760
Apparently they think because they're like political types that the ESRB would go, okey

562
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
dokey.

563
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,480
They couldn't do her job the first time or something.

564
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,120
And actually the other thing that they're also wanting done is because they're a little

565
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,560
bit pissed off at the whole Wii controls and how you can murder people using the Wii remote,

566
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,840
they want the Wii games to be rated differently because of such things like that.

567
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,320
So they want that taken into consideration for future ratings.

568
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,240
Because you know you can still aim a gun with a mouse.

569
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,960
Escapist in chat says, sweet Jesus, is Manhunt 2 even selling that well?

570
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,960
My thoughts exactly.

571
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,280
No, I can tell you right now it's not.

572
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,960
Honestly, I don't understand the point of it.

573
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,160
I mean, and doesn't fucking Hillary Clinton have better things to do?

574
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
No.

575
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Seriously.

576
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,080
Well, I heard she's running for president.

577
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,000
I know, doesn't she have better things to do?

578
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,080
I really hope she wins.

579
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,360
Well, if I remember right though, it's not just her, but she did band together with these

580
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
other folks.

581
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
It's a multi-partisan thing.

582
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,560
I think this goes back to the fact that politicians generally are a little bit ignorant about

583
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
this stuff.

584
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,120
See, that's why I don't understand this.

585
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,220
Four letters from politicians and they want results, yet if I send them four letters to

586
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,640
shut the fuck up, then you're not going to do it either, so why should they listen to

587
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
them?

588
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
I don't know.

589
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,080
Well, maybe someone the ESRB should listen to is Mr. T, because goddamn it, everybody

590
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
should listen to Mr. T.

591
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
Right.

592
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
Boom.

593
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,000
And if that is true, then everybody will soon own a copy of World of Warcraft, because there

594
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,680
are brand new commercials featuring Mr. T and William Shatner for World of Warcraft.

595
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Hilarious.

596
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
And they're pretty...

597
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Like the Night Elf Mohawk.

598
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,240
They're very interesting, because yeah, in the commercial, and I'm not going to play

599
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,680
it because Blizzard isn't paying us to play it, but in the commercial, Mr. T talks about

600
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,800
how he fantasizes himself as a Night Elf Mohawk, even though there isn't actually a Mohawk

601
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
in the game.

602
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,800
And William Shatner is a shaman, a torn shaman, which is a very interesting one.

603
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,960
Go figure, he's been nerfed to hell.

604
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,000
Apparently Mini-Me has filmed a commercial as well.

605
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,080
Verne Troyer has also filmed one.

606
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,960
I hope to God he's a gnome.

607
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,320
You better believe he's a gnome.

608
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
That's all I have to say.

609
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
I hope to God he's a gnome.

610
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
No, I think they're going to do the ironic thing where he's going to play a very tall

611
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
character.

612
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,920
He's going to die.

613
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Lame.

614
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,360
I already got Shatner as a Torrin.

615
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:11,000
See here, on a completely different note, Warcraft may be taking over PCs, but one game

616
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,480
that's taking over PlayStation 3 would be Warhawk, and they're getting their first expansion

617
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
here pretty soon.

618
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,480
It's supposed to be out sometime during December, and it's going to be called Operation Omega

619
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Dawn.

620
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
Lame title.

621
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:34,640
And it's going to be filled with some cool stuff, including new vehicles, a KT-424 combat

622
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,600
drop ship, and a new battlefield, the Omega Factory, and there's going to be some nighttime

623
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,520
based battles as well.

624
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
So...

625
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Oh.

626
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,920
A few cliched titles.

627
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,440
Well, it's nice to see that they're expanding their games, what few they have, so more power

628
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
to them.

629
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
I agree.

630
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,240
I mean, there's a lot of dumb titles out there in video gaming, so titles aren't everything,

631
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,280
it's the gameplay that's going to be important in this expansion.

632
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,200
And Chat, I love you guys, we're already subverting it.

633
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
What?

634
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
What did they say in Chatroom?

635
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
They're already subverting it.

636
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
Who?

637
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
They're already subverting the title name.

638
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Who and what?

639
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Chatroom.

640
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Who, specifically, and what?

641
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:21,600
We have Nim calling it Omega Dump, Sashil Omega Dumb, Omega Dong, Omega Gong.

642
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,520
How mature!

643
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,000
Omega Penis!

644
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,560
Whoa, did we just make our first penis joke.

645
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,440
Probably not the last.

646
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:40,360
Speaking of jokes, the PlayStation 3 version of the Orange Box may be pretty hilarious.

647
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,560
Apparently the...

648
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,720
Thank you, Drew, for that very scary maniacal laughter.

649
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,040
What the hell was that?

650
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,280
That was my evil laugh.

651
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
That apparently was the evil...

652
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Wow.

653
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,480
That was the evil, I am laughing at you, PS3.

654
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Oh, I'm a little scared about this.

655
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,360
Anyhow, the Orange Box is actually, it's not being ported by Valve, who were doing the

656
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
PC and 360 versions.

657
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,160
Apparently another team at EA has taken upon it to actually port this game over to the

658
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,640
PlayStation 3, and the earlier reports are saying, not that great.

659
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,200
Were they the team behind, like, Superman Returns?

660
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,240
Oh, God, I hope not.

661
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,440
Apparently there are a number of frame rate hiccups and other technical issues, which,

662
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:31,680
quote, at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable.

663
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,840
You know, what's interesting is if you think about other things you might have read about,

664
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,320
Gabe Newell, who's one of the co-founders of Valve, he's openly voiced previously, he's

665
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,200
not really big on the PlayStation 3.

666
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,600
He's called it directly a waste of everybody's time.

667
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,760
Oh, snap.

668
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,080
However, you know, the Orange Box is a pretty awesome game, which, well, going off of what

669
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
I've heard.

670
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,360
But Loki certainly said a lot of great things about Orange Box.

671
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,000
Dark Sakura loves her some Portal, she's gone frickin' crazy with Portal.

672
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,200
I will be playing Orange Box this week, though, because Loki's loamiest copy, so I'll let

673
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,000
you know next week.

674
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,560
But you know, whenever great games get disgraced like that, it makes us a little bit angsty.

675
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:30,440
And when we get angsty, the F.U. music comes in and we do our rants.

676
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,260
I'd actually like to start tonight because I'm reading chat.

677
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:39,280
I'm gonna give an F.U. to Nim, who said, Omega, two girls, one cup.

678
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,880
Seriously.

679
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Let it go.

680
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,340
Seriously, let it go on both ends of that.

681
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't really have anything else to really say F.U. to, so I guess you get that.

682
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,560
F.U. to sleeping until one today, that was pretty awesome.

683
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:59,000
Loki, F.U. to being sick, being stuffed up and all the other fun stuff that goes along

684
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
with it.

685
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,240
But, I'm gonna take tomorrow off, because I'm not feeling that well, so, you know.

686
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,040
You show them, I'm gonna take tomorrow off, damn straight.

687
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,440
Are you gonna play games while you're sick, or are you just gonna sleep, or what?

688
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,160
Fuck yeah, I'm playing games, that's probably what I'm gonna do.

689
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,880
Drew, do you have any F.U.s of the week you'd like to share?

690
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,120
F.U. to Loki's SARS.

691
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,120
I don't have SARS.

692
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
I hope it's not contagious.

693
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,600
F.U. to people in Battlefield 2 who insist I fly a helicopter even though I have no idea

694
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,040
how to fly a helicopter.

695
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,840
F.U. to not having all these wonderful PC games that are coming out lately, and F.U.

696
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
to not being able to feed my wow addiction.

697
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,400
Well, you just need to have, you know, Tank upload a program for you to learn how to fly

698
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
a combat helicopter.

699
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,360
Ooh, points for the Matrix reference.

700
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,600
Alright, I guess that's gonna do it for the F.U.s of the week.

701
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,480
Incredibly nerdy, thanks to Drew being here.

702
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,320
You know what's funny is, we're having that guy, Joe Pantalone, I think, coming in.

703
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,000
The guy that played Cypher.

704
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
He's coming in to our work.

705
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,240
But that guy, he's that guy, you don't really know his name, but like in every mob movie

706
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
he plays.

707
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
A mob guy.

708
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
A mob guy, yeah, yeah.

709
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Or he plays, or he, no.

710
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,680
Well, I don't know where, how do you put it?

711
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
What was that movie?

712
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Memento.

713
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:26,320
Yes, he's in Memento, and Sopranos, and, oddly enough, The Princess Diaries.

714
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,200
Not that I watched that movie or anything.

715
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,680
The wife probably made you do it.

716
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:37,640
It was one of those, uh, remotes way over there, it's stuck on the family channel, and

717
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,520
I'm like, fuck, I don't want to get up, but, lazy!

718
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,840
I almost watched The Princess Diaries.

719
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,080
I finally got up when it, you know, finished the movie, and then it started playing The

720
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
Princess Diaries again.

721
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
And you were crying.

722
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,720
I was like, I don't want to watch this again!

723
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
Horrible.

724
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Okay, so what, he's going to your work?

725
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,440
Are you going to get an Orange Lounge Radio autograph?

726
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
You should.

727
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,200
Um, I don't know why he's autographing, he's coming in for this movie.

728
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,640
We need more stuff in the studio.

729
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
I know.

730
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
Future studio.

731
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
I know.

732
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,240
Coolists are fucking, like, lame.

733
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
They don't want him autographing certain things.

734
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,120
I wanted to bring in, like, a Matrix poster for him to sign, but...

735
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,640
I still vote for the steak dinner.

736
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
I don't know.

737
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,440
Alright, let's get back to the news.

738
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,760
So, yeah, you know, there's not a lot of games for girls out there that are really good,

739
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,880
but guess what?

740
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,000
That's not going to be the case anymore, Fleece, if you own a phone.

741
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,840
There's going to be a game called The Coolest Girl in School, which is being pitched as

742
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,200
Grand Theft Auto for girls, and it's being developed by, um, Champagne...

743
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
What?

744
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,760
Is that the actual company?

745
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,040
Okay, I'm sorry, but this is the actual company.

746
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,280
Developed by Champagne for the Ladies is the name of the...

747
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,960
Loki, this sounds right up your alley.

748
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Champagne for the Ladies?

749
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,960
What kind of a fucking development team is that?

750
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,280
This sounds like the candy that strangers use to get people in their cars.

751
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
I mean...

752
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Oh, but it gets better.

753
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,760
I got Champagne for the Ladies.

754
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,800
Every place is all the boyish drug running and random violence with stuff girls like.

755
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,840
Like experimenting with drugs, using sex...

756
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
What?

757
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Using sexuality for personal gain, inclined to the top of the social order, by any means

758
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
necessary.

759
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,900
Shut the fuck up, where is this from?

760
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,900
Is this for real?

761
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:28,720
Yeah, it's, um, you can gossip, shoplifting, uh, game, you know, all sorts of things like

762
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,720
that.

763
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:40,840
Anyways, uh, Grisby in chat says, uh, Grand Theft Auto, Ho Island.

764
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Now that's degrading.

765
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,200
Uh, it's degrading.

766
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,360
Apparently there's a report, though, on Canada.com, yes, they are so cool, they have their own

767
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
.com.

768
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,720
Um, they're writing that, uh, while the Australian Family Association deems the game toxic, uh,

769
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:03,360
and Christine Devitt of the Montreal's Concordia University calls it corrosive, that's not

770
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,880
really a description for a game, the folks at Champ...

771
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Insert blame Canada jokes here.

772
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,960
Oh my god, it is, that is the actual development name for the company.

773
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,360
The folks at Champagne for the Ladies say it's all good fun.

774
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,320
First off, I'm sorry, but no one's going to take a company named Champagne for the Ladies,

775
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
seriously.

776
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,880
GS-191 has an interesting point, it's the Winona Ryder Simulator.

777
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,840
Uh, this is more of like a Britney Spears simulator, drugs ruin your life and all that

778
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
stuff, my god.

779
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,480
But, like, I don't know, tell me if it's just me, but isn't there, like, a sick side of

780
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,360
you that, like, kind of wants to play it when it's all said and done, like, I'm kinda like,

781
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,000
you know, it's like one of those things, like, I have to play it, like, before I die.

782
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You know what?

783
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,840
Take two, pay attention to what they're doing in this game, that way you can add a female

784
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,240
character into Grand Theft Auto that you can play, and there you go, that's what women

785
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
like.

786
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,200
Women like using sexuality for personal games, and doing all this stuff like that.

787
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,640
When Jamie's not here, this is what happens.

788
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,640
The show gets ruined.

789
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Alright, uh...

790
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,160
Since the girl-centered role-playing game puts magnifying glass into the darker side

791
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,960
of school life with participants encouraged to experiment with fashion, oh, experiment

792
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:27,040
with fashion, oh no, fashion, drugs, sexuality, cutting class, and spreading rumors, oh, spreading

793
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
rumors.

794
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Anyways.

795
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,880
Frisbee asks, what would Jamie's comments on this be?

796
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
I don't have a clue.

797
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,520
If we get her on the phone later, we'll have to watch, I really don't know.

798
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:45,600
She would probably be making some sort of noise similar to this.

799
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,640
That's I think what Jamie would do.

800
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Call me crazy.

801
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,400
Anyhow, let's get back into some real games, such as a real gamer girl, Lara Croft.

802
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,600
And I say that because Lara Croft has big boobs.

803
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,240
No, just kidding.

804
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,500
But of course, Lara Croft is much more of a hero than any of the characters in that

805
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,640
other game ever will be.

806
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,880
Lara Croft has come out with Tomb Raider Anniversary on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

807
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,320
It's actually available for 1,200 Microsoft points, that's going to set you back about

808
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
15 bucks.

809
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,980
Here's the thing though, you need to own Tomb Raider Legend in order to play it because

810
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,520
it's technically downloadable content for that.

811
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,560
But if you want to download the Tomb Raider Anniversary, check that out.

812
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,360
It's available on the Xbox 360 right now.

813
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Yay.

814
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,960
Actually, I think that's only the first half of the game.

815
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,880
I think it's going to be two halves, they're about 1,200 points each.

816
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,000
Well, then there you have it.

817
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,480
But if you don't like that, you can spend an extra 10 bucks and buy the disc.

818
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,560
So what's Lara Croft's equivalent of horse armor?

819
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,440
Or better yet, just wait a few months because this game isn't that great to begin with and

820
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,280
wait for the drop in price.

821
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
Does download content drop in price that much?

822
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
I guess so.

823
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
No, I'm talking about buying...

824
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
I bought Carcassonne and then it was free like four months later.

825
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
I'm talking about buying the disc version of the game.

826
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,320
Oh, I gotcha.

827
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:11,000
Anyways, speaking of Xbox Live stuff, if you live in Europe, they're going to be offering

828
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,720
you instead of Halo 3 for buying an Xbox 360, 10 free Xbox Live arcade games for new European

829
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,760
Xbox 360 owners and a friend.

830
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
Let's see here.

831
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:31,320
Now, what you can do, if you buy a console between October 1st and December 14th, you

832
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,240
can fill out a form and then both you and a friend can get 10 free Xbox Live arcade

833
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,320
games, which, to be honest, aren't that bad.

834
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:47,440
It's a pretty good selection, including Every Extend Extra Extreme, Sonic the Hedgehog,

835
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,400
Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting, Bomberman Live, Marble Blast Ultra, Spy Glass Board

836
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:00,600
Games, Small Arms, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures, Assault Heroes, and Zuma Deluxe.

837
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Hey, it's free.

838
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
It's not bad.

839
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
That's not bad at all.

840
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,680
We don't have anything comparable like here in the U.S.

841
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,320
Well, maybe like the arcade bundle has the five games with it.

842
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,960
Yeah, but a little different.

843
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Interesting.

844
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,560
Well, lucky those folks over in Europe.

845
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,080
Also, let's get into some release dates and talk about Europe first.

846
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,760
Jamie's not here, but I've got you covered on what is coming out in Europe.

847
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,420
I imagine now that the holidays are over, things are slowing down in terms of release

848
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,040
dates, but apparently not.

849
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,320
There's still a lot of stuff coming out on the 30th over in Europe.

850
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:40,060
We have a port of Alvin and the Chipmunks, which is a translation of that Oscar award-winning

851
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
movie that's coming out.

852
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,060
It's a music game.

853
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,060
Is it a music game for real?

854
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,240
It's not karaoke though, but it's a rhythm music game.

855
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,840
There's rhythm music games that are good, like DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, then there's

856
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
these types of music games.

857
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
This isn't going to be one of them.

858
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Yeah, exactly.

859
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,200
Alvin and Chipmunks comes out on the 30th on the DS and the Wii.

860
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,080
BlackSight Area 51 makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360, also on the 30th.

861
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,920
Boogie finally makes its way to Europe on PlayStation 2 and the DS this week.

862
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,720
Cruisin comes out on the Wii, I'm sure you can skip that.

863
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,960
Football Manager for the PSP comes out, as well as Guitar Hero 3 comes out on the PC

864
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
this week.

865
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,400
I believe it already came out on the consoles last week, because I've seen, yeah, it must

866
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,800
come out last week, because I saw some British folks joining the OL Army.

867
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,240
Genga comes out on the DS on the 30th.

868
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,920
Medal of Honor for the PSP also comes out on the 30th.

869
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,360
Pro Evo Soccer 2008 for the PSP also on the 30th.

870
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:39,760
Puzzle Quest comes out on the PlayStation 2, Resident Evil the Umbrella Chronicles on

871
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,240
the Wii, Speedball 2 on the PC, Siphon Filter on the PSP, The Golden Compass on Damn Near

872
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,600
Every System, again another kind of gaming port of a movie, and lastly, but certainly

873
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:59,440
not leastly, My Horse and Me on the PC, developed by Atari, and you wonder why their CEO recently

874
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,440
left the company.

875
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,360
Anyways, for the US there's really not a whole lot coming out this week.

876
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,360
On the DS, I don't know why they're releasing this game, but Master of Illusion, it's a

877
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,440
magic trick training sim or something like that.

878
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,960
It teaches you how to do card tricks, and you do magic with your DS.

879
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Who's gonna be...

880
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,720
Oh my god, and it's fucking full-priced?

881
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
That's got to be different.

882
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,640
We just stole $34 out of your wallet.

883
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
That's magic!

884
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
That's a...

885
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,040
Well, if you're buying it from GameStop, it's full-priced, but it's not...

886
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,040
Two words.

887
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
It's supposed to be $20.

888
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,040
Two words.

889
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,440
Ping Pals.

890
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,760
Cranium Kabuki, if you like that trivia game, normally a board game, you can buy that from

891
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,280
Ubisoft on the Wii, Boogie is coming out on the DS this week, also Geometry Wars Galaxies

892
00:43:51,280 --> 00:44:02,440
on the DS, History Channel Battle for the Pacific on the Wii, and indoor sports from

893
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,720
Konami, although that's not coming out, that's next year.

894
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:16,320
Well, they list it as, because we have some more current dates than they do, that's it.

895
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
It's really...

896
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,200
I imagine it's probably a much slower week here, thanks to Black Friday being over.

897
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,680
Did they actually venture out on Black Friday, out of curiosity?

898
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,120
I did later on in the evening.

899
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:33,640
I went to GameStop around 2 to pick up the Wings of the Goddess, and it wasn't that bad.

900
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,920
They were adequately staffed, I'll tell you that.

901
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,600
They had people walking the floor and everything.

902
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,480
I went and bought Zola, and the Zapper, you know what's weird though?

903
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,600
The Zapper, from what we've, you know, the press release said it was supposed to be $20,

904
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:56,560
and my company, we're selling it, it's $20 retail, GameStop is selling it for $25.

905
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,080
Oh ho ho ho!

906
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Everywhere.

907
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Interesting.

908
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Chop around for the best deal?

909
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,240
No, I spent $25 because I'm lazy.

910
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,720
I don't know, it's wasted $25 right there, but yeah, we'll get into that later.

911
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,920
Alright, let's get into some Japanese release dates.

912
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:18,680
Assassin's Creed comes out in Japan, the localized version for the Xbox 360 from Ubisoft.

913
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,120
Apocalypse Desire Next is a new game on the Xbox 360.

914
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,440
It is a strategy-based game, and it doesn't look like anything we have over here.

915
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,920
Just trying to take a look at some screenshots real quick.

916
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,760
Looks like it might be a tactical type of game.

917
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
Trying to look here.

918
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,520
Oh yes, definitely more of a tactical-based type of game, so check that out.

919
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,640
If you like those games, Apocalypse Desire Next, also coming out this week in Japan.

920
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:50,080
On the Wii, Swing Golf, Pangea Second Shot is coming out, which I'm sure is just kind

921
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:53,960
of Nintendo's version of Hot Shots Golf, or Who We Trying to Kid is just another rip-off

922
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,860
of a Wii Sports title.

923
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:02,820
Also coming out on the Wii, Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes on the Wii, coming out from Capcom.

924
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,080
Also coming out in Japan, Tony Hawk's Project 8 on the PlayStation 3.

925
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:13,400
Star Train Your Past Makes Your Future on the PlayStation 2 from Princess Soft.

926
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,440
Yep, you can get a limited edition of that game as well if you follow every Princess

927
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,680
Soft title.

928
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:26,360
Speaking of Princesses on the Nintendo DS, Disney Princesses Magical Jewels comes out

929
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,840
in Japan.

930
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,960
I don't know exactly what their magical jewels are, but I don't want to find out.

931
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,600
Cats 2 comes out of the Nintendo DS in Japan, another cat simulation game, because apparently

932
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,920
Cats 1 with a Z, that's Cats with a Z, was so popular there is now a Cats 2.

933
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,800
Fuku Mori, Mori No Unhappy Project is coming out from Bandai also on the Nintendo DS, and

934
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,860
I have no idea what this game is all about.

935
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,160
Looks like it could be another mix of mini-games, it's hard to tell from the screenshots, it's

936
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,520
an action-based game, probably a typical platformer.

937
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
What's so damn funny?

938
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Is it chat?

939
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
It's chat.

940
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,080
What are they saying in chat, Drew?

941
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh, typical DMN.

942
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,480
Princess Soft, doesn't Rob work for them?

943
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,760
Hahaha, funny.

944
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,560
Coming on the PSP, Disgaea Hour of Darkness Portable coming out, the portable version

945
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,160
of the popular strategy game, that's going to do it for Japanese release dates.

946
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Awesome.

947
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,840
Anyways, one thing that's supposedly coming soon to the Wii, which is weird because I

948
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:35,160
never thought I would, but the Unreal 3 engine is apparently being adapted for the Wii by

949
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,560
some unnamed company.

950
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,880
They're porting it over much like I guess they did with the Unreal 2 engine.

951
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,480
Oh, Ubisoft ported over the Unreal 2 engine for Red Steel.

952
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,280
So is it coming over for Red Steel 2, maybe?

953
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,280
I don't know.

954
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,560
Because isn't the rumors that that game is supposed to be made?

955
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,560
It is.

956
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,560
Hopefully it doesn't suck as much as the first one.

957
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,760
Yeah, maybe they can make it right this time.

958
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
I don't know.

959
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:10,040
You know, you've heard my opinion on Ubisoft ports for Wii.

960
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,400
I tried to stay away from them.

961
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,000
But we don't know for sure it's them.

962
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,060
It's an unnamed company that's doing it, but it's just kind of one of those, you know,

963
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,040
if you were betting, odds would favor this.

964
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,440
I think they could probably do it if they did something like cel-shaded or something

965
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,640
like that, very simple like Wind Waker type graphics, where you simplify and you'll have

966
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,280
all these textures and stuff you have to worry about, you could probably pump some interesting

967
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,200
stuff out on the Unreal engine.

968
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,060
Xenocore in chat says, why adapt Unreal Tournament 3 for the Wii?

969
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,060
What the fuck?

970
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,600
I'm obviously speaking about the engine in general, not the game.

971
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,560
Again, it's money.

972
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,280
If a company can port their game to multiple systems this way, they'll do it.

973
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:53,520
And if they can successfully port Unreal Engine over for the Wii, then they can sell that

974
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,280
to other companies, you know, to make Wii versions of stuff using the Unreal 3 engine.

975
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,480
And plus, you know, with just the Wii selling as crazy as it is, you know, if you've probably

976
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,120
seen the stories on Black Friday, people are still going crazy about the Nintendo Wii,

977
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,400
and it's, you know, it's kind of a different demographic.

978
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,300
You know, the more family household, quote unquote, is where the Nintendo Wiis are going.

979
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,920
So certainly if there is a particular game that they want to try and get a piece of that

980
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:22,720
audience with that type of, you know, share of the marketplace, they'll go for it.

981
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,960
Anyhow, let's take this opportunity to dive into the mailbag and take a look at some of

982
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,320
the emails that we've gotten this week.

983
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,320
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbagorangelaunchradio.com.

984
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,480
Mark Sakura will usually take on these responsibilities, but since she's not here, I stole the password

985
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:46,800
to the mailbag and I'm looking in her place.

986
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,160
Let's look at email number one tonight of four emails we're reading tonight.

987
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:56,280
Email number one comes to us from Arvid, who didn't use a handle, so I called him by his

988
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,280
real name.

989
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,480
And Arvid says, greetings, just a quick question.

990
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,560
What is the song called that you play at the end of the show, and from what game is it?

991
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,760
Sorry if this has already been answered in the forums.

992
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,280
The song at the end of the program that you will hear in a little while when we finish

993
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:23,960
is iFutureList by Kiriyama Oka, which I believe appeared in DDR Supernova in the US for a

994
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,960
console game.

995
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,200
I thought it was Xtreme 2 also.

996
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,200
Was it in Xtreme 2?

997
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,840
I thought it was Supernova.

998
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,460
And I'm sure one of the Bahmani nerds in the chat knows for sure, but it made its first

999
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,440
appearance in one of the 2DX games.

1000
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,400
I want to say 2DX 13th?

1001
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,400
I don't remember.

1002
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,400
It's been a long time.

1003
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
I stopped tracking after 8th.

1004
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,540
And it shows up in various Bahmani games.

1005
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:52,480
Let's go to the next email coming to us from Chard, also known as Rick the UK fanboy.

1006
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,720
Hey guys, do you have a postage address?

1007
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,360
We're going through a mass tidy at our house and I have to throw out a lot of my stuff.

1008
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,640
I've come across some things that might be fun to send you.

1009
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,360
A Christmas present maybe.

1010
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,840
Oh, I like presents.

1011
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:10,240
As long as it's not a B-O-M-B, then I guess I'm okay with giving out the address.

1012
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
So we'll see.

1013
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,560
Yeah, sure, I'll reply to that and find out, but there's another part of this.

1014
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,120
I wouldn't have read this on air if that was it.

1015
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,120
There is another part of this.

1016
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,080
Anyway, I also have a question.

1017
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,840
Which game were you so excited to get and when it came out was the biggest disappointment?

1018
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,760
If you could go back in time and hit the developer over the head with a big comedy inflatable

1019
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,480
hammer, what would you get them to change?

1020
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,080
Cheerio, governor, chimney, cup of tea, telly, and all that stuff.

1021
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,920
Well, he is our UK fanboy, so you forgot crumpets.

1022
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,920
You forgot crumpets.

1023
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,680
Hope you had a good turkey day or whatever the devil it is you Americans celebrate.

1024
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,680
This is Thanksgiving.

1025
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,240
I don't know.

1026
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,840
A game that came out and you were extremely disappointed in it.

1027
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
Actually I can...

1028
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,840
It's easy.

1029
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,840
I know right off the top of my head what it is.

1030
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,720
I can think of one right now.

1031
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,720
Red Seal.

1032
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:07,440
You know, it was really hyped up, it was supposed to be really awesome, and really was not awesome.

1033
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,000
It was controlled by poop.

1034
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,560
It was one of those things that sounded great on paper, huh?

1035
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:12,560
It did.

1036
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Yes.

1037
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,000
And I don't know, it was just exciting.

1038
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,760
The whole concept of, you know, people call you on your phone in the game and you pick

1039
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,400
it up, you know, your remote like a phone.

1040
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:28,480
Apparently though, your phone has really shitty sound on it because, you know, those controllers.

1041
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,880
Very good.

1042
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,880
Drew?

1043
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,880
I have two.

1044
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,880
Okay.

1045
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,480
Guilty Gear Dust Strikers, the DS game.

1046
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,280
And the second almost everyone can agree with, the Matrix Path of Neo.

1047
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,680
It had such promise too.

1048
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,360
And then they went and screwed it up just like they did Enter the Matrix.

1049
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
Which one was the Matrix Path of Neo?

1050
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
I don't remember that one.

1051
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,360
I remember Enter the Matrix.

1052
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,360
It came out a couple years ago.

1053
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,080
It came out a couple years ago where you actually played as Neo, which is what all the Matrix

1054
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,920
fans wanted, you know, to play as Neo.

1055
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,520
But they screwed up the fighting system, they screwed up the plot, and they made a joke

1056
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,080
of a last boss.

1057
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,920
Easy, easy, easy for me.

1058
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,600
The game that was the biggest disappointment where I wanted to go back and smack the developers

1059
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,600
upside the head.

1060
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,040
And then 10 Dogs.

1061
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,040
Remember E3?

1062
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,200
I freaking fell in love with this game.

1063
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,400
I said it's going to be the greatest game that comes out this year and then when the

1064
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,760
game comes out I was bored with it in an hour.

1065
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,760
Woof.

1066
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,000
I know because there was nothing really else to do besides those three contests.

1067
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,760
There wasn't a lot of, like, competitive stuff and there wasn't much you could do with the

1068
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,760
dogs.

1069
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,280
Yes, I realized it was supposed to be a sim, but I don't know.

1070
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,520
I was thinking there would be more of a game to it and there wasn't and that was kind of

1071
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,520
sad.

1072
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,520
How about We Connect 24?

1073
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,720
Does that count as a game?

1074
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
Kind of.

1075
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,240
Animal Crossing DS would be a close second for me, honestly.

1076
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,040
Because I was expecting so much more from that and I think it felt more like a port

1077
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,360
than a sequel and that was what was ultimately disappointing.

1078
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,360
So there you have it.

1079
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,720
And the other disappointing thing about Nintendogs is the fact that it's been selling like crazy

1080
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,840
and now we have all of these knockoff games to thank, such as, like, Cats 2, which I think

1081
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
we said earlier.

1082
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,640
Imagine Babies, all those stuff.

1083
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:16,280
Did you see they had, what was it, a bundle, I think, through, honestly, maybe, it was

1084
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,240
like one of the big retail chains.

1085
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,660
But it was the Nintendogs, like that metallic red or rose DS, and then two or three other

1086
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,660
versions of Nintendogs.

1087
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,640
You get, like, four of the same game.

1088
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,640
Nice.

1089
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,560
Very nice.

1090
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,120
Diemen Nourishment said it was designed to be played like 15 minutes a day, Rob.

1091
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,120
What do you want?

1092
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,120
Yeah!

1093
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,120
And then it got boring after two days.

1094
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,620
I mean, that was the problem.

1095
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,240
There was not a lot to come back for.

1096
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,720
There wasn't a lot to kind of, like, earn or work towards in that game.

1097
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,720
It's a frickin' Tamagotchi.

1098
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
Kinda.

1099
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,720
I don't know.

1100
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,680
It just, I was expecting so much more based on what I saw at E3.

1101
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,000
I was so excited and I was just so disappointed.

1102
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,800
Transformers The Game.

1103
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,800
Yeah.

1104
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,000
That would be one I was extremely disappointed in.

1105
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,720
All right, let's move on.

1106
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,800
Here's a story tip from our old buddy, RobWithTwoBees.

1107
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,960
Here is a link to a boy killing an old woman for money.

1108
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,480
He just happened to admit that it was to pay for an MMORPG time.

1109
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,480
I don't see how this is actually related to games, but that's how it is spun.

1110
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,380
If you ask me, the violent act was done solely for money.

1111
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,040
The fact that it was for four pounds sterling doesn't make it more tragic because the kid

1112
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,000
didn't know how much she had.

1113
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,920
So in other words, he's sending us a link to the story about how, you know, let's see,

1114
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,200
boy murders old woman for game money.

1115
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,440
Oh, and this is a story that was Doug and everything.

1116
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,520
It was a 13-year-old kid in Vietnam robbed an 81-year-old woman and he used the money

1117
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,200
to play online games.

1118
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,560
I see.

1119
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,880
And obviously where Rob's kinda going is that, isn't this really about a robbery?

1120
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,240
Why does it necessarily have to be about games?

1121
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,740
Who cares what they spin it on?

1122
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,480
It wasn't me, I swear.

1123
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,480
I mean, it's like, if he spin it on crack, it wouldn't have made the news.

1124
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,760
You know, it's sad that that woman got robbed, but we really want to know, what did he spend

1125
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,760
the money on?

1126
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,160
Let's get in the mind of this criminal.

1127
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,440
How did he spend that money?

1128
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,040
And then, let's prove that gamers are completely worthless moral rejects.

1129
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:11,760
I love this too, is that the story makes reference to the story from earlier this month when

1130
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,380
that kid beat up his mom over Halo 3 when she tried to take it away from him, like call

1131
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,200
the cops, that whole thing we read on a previous show.

1132
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,680
They remind folks of that.

1133
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,480
Yeah, let's just call it bad parenting and leave it at that.

1134
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,420
That's your Jamie angle, I imagine.

1135
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,560
Thank you, you do a very good job for filling in for Jamie when she's not here.

1136
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,560
I appreciate that.

1137
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,140
All right, we got one more email for you guys this week, and then if you want to contribute

1138
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,960
an email in the future, it's mailbag at orangelaunchrader.com.

1139
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,420
Our last email tonight comes from Rissimo, and Rissimo asks, hey guys, I love the show,

1140
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,280
and I always make sure to tell my friends about it.

1141
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,280
Thank you.

1142
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,440
I recall Loki saying that he had Ratchet and Clank.

1143
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,640
He hasn't said anything else about the game in a while.

1144
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,640
I love the game and was wondering if it's even been in his PS3 yet.

1145
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,160
My PS3 is being borrowed by a friend who likes Ratchet and Clank a lot more than I do.

1146
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,160
Nice.

1147
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,560
And he's playing it, and he loves the game.

1148
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,800
So that's a no, but to be honest, I don't even think I want to play the game.

1149
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,800
It looks fun.

1150
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
It looks like Ratchet and Clank.

1151
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
Then why'd you buy it?

1152
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,400
Because I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order, and I just said fuck it, I'm going to pick

1153
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,400
it up because it's supposed to be a good game.

1154
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,960
New tool.

1155
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:21,960
It looks good.

1156
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,800
It looks fun, but you know, it's just, I didn't play any of the Ratchet and Clank games, and

1157
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,160
there's probably a reason for that, because I didn't want to play them, and why the fuck

1158
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,160
did I buy the new one?

1159
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,360
I know, because I'm desperate for good games for the PS3.

1160
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,920
And which you don't play.

1161
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,160
Well, now I'm loaned it to a friend right now because he's going to get his own PS3

1162
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,440
soon, and probably when he does that, I'm probably going to sell him the game, so.

1163
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,920
Rama says, damn, Loki, you're sad.

1164
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,120
And Artitsuya says, Loki, do you think Mario Galaxy ripped them off as they claim?

1165
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,120
No.

1166
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,120
Alright.

1167
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,040
More of the email from Marisimo here.

1168
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,120
Also if you guys tried Super Stardust HD or any other PSN titles, I think that even though

1169
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,680
the selection is pretty slim, most of the games are worth trying, especially if you've

1170
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,360
got a Japanese account.

1171
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,080
GTProlog looks fucking amazing.

1172
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,680
Thanks for consistently putting on such great shows, we appreciate it.

1173
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,680
Thank you.

1174
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,880
I do have a Japanese account, and I do play GTProlog, and I still don't like Gran Turismo,

1175
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,320
no matter how pretty they make it, but that's just my personal preference.

1176
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,320
It looks pretty.

1177
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,540
I wouldn't say it's any better than Project Anthem Racing 3.

1178
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:33,200
I don't know, it's just, it's, when the, get the cars looking that good, it really, at

1179
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,280
this point, it's not like leaps and bounds better than anything that's out there right

1180
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
now.

1181
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,440
So, you know, whatever.

1182
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,000
I do have Flow.

1183
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Flow's fun.

1184
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,840
I, personally, the only thing that's really stopping me from buying games on the Playstation

1185
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,640
Network is I hate their fucking account system, where you have to put money on this account

1186
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,080
or whatever, and then you download games with that, and you end up with this like five cent

1187
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:00,080
remainders and shit on there, because everything's like, you know, this 99 or whatever, instead

1188
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,040
of rounding them out, it's like, you know, Xbox Live Marketplace.

1189
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:09,280
So I just, even with Xbox Live Marketplace, so you get a little bit of that, where like

1190
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,320
you always have some points left over, you know?

1191
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,160
Yeah, but at least there's stuff I can download on there, I mean, and also a lot of the download

1192
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:22,160
stuff that they have on the Playstation Network is a little bit more expensive, or like less

1193
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,840
production value or whatever.

1194
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:29,240
I know there's good stuff on there, like Everyday Shooter and some of the stuff like that, but

1195
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,680
there's nothing really that's jumped out at me, other than Flow.

1196
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,840
Flow's kind of fun, but I don't know.

1197
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,840
Alright.

1198
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,160
Alright, well that's it for the mailbag, so again, if you want to email us sometime, mailbag

1199
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,560
at orangelaungeradio.com.

1200
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:47,200
Alright, anyways, on to some other stuff.

1201
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,760
Of course, it's no surprise that Super Mario Galaxy is selling well.

1202
00:59:51,760 --> 01:00:01,360
It has sold 500,000 copies in the US in the first week alone, which is pretty awesome,

1203
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:06,000
and of course it's probably going to be continuing to sell well all throughout the holidays.

1204
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,320
We also know that it sold 250,000 units in Japan in its first week as well, so definitely

1205
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,120
one of the more popular games for the Wii out there, but I think it's no surprise that

1206
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,560
it's selling that well.

1207
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,040
Although not millions and millions of copies, though, kind of like Halo 3.

1208
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,360
Yeah, but wait for the Christmas season to be over.

1209
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,360
True.

1210
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,880
And this is also a game that people are going to constantly buy going forward.

1211
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,640
Halo 3, I don't know, it just kind of teetered off, like really quick, I think.

1212
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:38,040
Well, I mean, it had a huge launch, and everybody that had Halo 2, it's kind of like earlier

1213
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,240
in the show, it's like about the whole MMO thing.

1214
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,520
In a way, it's kind of similar with hardcore fans of a series.

1215
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,360
Everybody's going to be out there day one buying it.

1216
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,120
Can you imagine if Halo 3's multiplayer servers have gone down going, oh, sorry, we didn't

1217
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,680
think so many people would try to get on, which is basically what Squeenix did with

1218
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,680
Final Fantasy.

1219
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,560
Well, the difference is there's a single player element to Halo.

1220
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,960
I guess that's true.

1221
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,920
All right, well, anyhow, you can play single player in Final Fantasy XI.

1222
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,640
That's fine.

1223
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,120
There's a new device out there called the Cyber Familator.

1224
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,680
It allows you to play your Famicom games on your DS Lite.

1225
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,400
Also with this device, you can use a TV Out.

1226
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,760
Now, keep in mind that is a Famicom emulator, and it's not actually an emulator, it's

1227
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:22,760
an actual device.

1228
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,560
You put your DS on top of it, and it does this whole thing, so keep in mind it's

1229
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:32,440
not, it's Japanese, so you can't use it for NES games.

1230
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,680
But just out of curiosity, is this something you guys would want?

1231
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,320
Would you want it like it is now to play Japanese imports, or do you think it might be kind

1232
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,080
of cool to have something to use your old school NES cartridges on?

1233
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,320
It looks kind of cool.

1234
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,880
Looks like almost the DS version of the Super 8.

1235
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,640
I'd get it just for nostalgia's sake.

1236
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,840
I wish there was more you could do with it, kind of like with the Super Game Boy and stuff,

1237
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,680
like you could change the colors and all that dumb shit.

1238
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,480
It would be cool if you could like, I don't know, hack the NES games and change the sprites

1239
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,760
like you can on the PC.

1240
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,000
Honestly, if I were just going to buy something like that extra from my DS, I'd just buy

1241
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,760
one of those cards to load ROMs on there and just play it off that.

1242
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,500
It would probably be a lot cheaper anyways.

1243
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,240
This person who I believe is DMN under one of his many nicknames will warn you though,

1244
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,880
it will fuck your warranty, FYI.

1245
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,440
That's a good point, if you're going to get something like this and install a game

1246
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,440
that still has warranties.

1247
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,640
Why would it fuck your warranty?

1248
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,800
I think it's something you have to attach there.

1249
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,620
No, it just plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot.

1250
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:32,200
That's why it's only on one screen, because it's plugging into the Game Boy Advance slot.

1251
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,000
You probably can fucking use it on a Game Boy Advance.

1252
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
But you know.

1253
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,560
Oh, it's for the DS, I'm sorry.

1254
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,560
Interesting.

1255
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:44,600
But yeah, it's not like something you have to mod your system for, that'd be stupid.

1256
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,680
Anyways, let's see here.

1257
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,280
There's actually been a series that just started on TV, and I've got to mention this.

1258
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,760
The Discovery Channel's Rise of the Video Game, it's actually pretty good.

1259
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,320
I watched the first episode of it, it reminds me if you've ever watched G4's Icon series

1260
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,560
that they have.

1261
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:05,400
Very similar to that kind of thing, but it's kind of the whole history of video games,

1262
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:11,880
and they just started with the very first computer game to the 70s, like Pac-Man, and

1263
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,880
stuff like that.

1264
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,520
Yeah, exactly, and a really fascinating series, I mean, they're going to replay the hell out

1265
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:23,360
of this all throughout the week, so I recommend catching it on TV, or YouTube.

1266
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,280
DMN would like to remind you that any third party thingamajig.license fucks your warranty,

1267
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,280
apparently.

1268
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
Oh.

1269
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,280
Oh.

1270
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,120
You mean I avoided my warranty by using the Game Genie on my NES?

1271
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,840
How would they prove that you fucked it up by plugging it in there?

1272
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,400
If there's no physical evidence, they're not going to be like, hmm, I sense residue from

1273
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
this thing.

1274
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,480
I mean, they're not fucking CSI.

1275
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,480
There's a lot of dust on this.

1276
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,760
My DS broke, you know, fix it, and they're just going to do it.

1277
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,000
They're not going to be able to tell unless you actually broke it open.

1278
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You'll never know.

1279
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I'm not CSI.

1280
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
They don't have the snappy one-liners.

1281
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,080
All right.

1282
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,080
Let's go.

1283
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,080
Wait, I actually want to ask real quick about the rise of the video game.

1284
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,320
Is that something you actually watched?

1285
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,320
Yeah, I did.

1286
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320
It was good.

1287
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,200
What was the format of it?

1288
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,880
Because I forgot to TiVo it.

1289
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,280
It's basically a reminder, like I said, of the Icon series.

1290
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,720
They kind of discussed different things that went on, and then they would have developers

1291
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,240
and major key figures and stuff commenting on it.

1292
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,640
They had the president of IGN.

1293
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,560
They had some of the first, the creator of Pac-Man and stuff, and they were talking about

1294
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:38,480
just all the phenomenon, the pop culture stuff related with video games, and just the mentality

1295
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,480
and all that stuff.

1296
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,720
They went and talked about Tetris.

1297
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,340
It just is very well done.

1298
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,200
It's a really cool series.

1299
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,480
I think it's worth checking out.

1300
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,720
The last documentary I watched on games was that PBS one that was in high def.

1301
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,720
It was kind of neat.

1302
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,760
I mean, this, like I said, I love the Icon series.

1303
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:05,120
That was probably my favorite show on G4, but now they do it about everything.

1304
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,920
It's no longer good.

1305
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,800
Well, speaking of paying tribute to the elders, this is the part of the show, because we are

1306
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,040
getting towards the end of the show.

1307
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,120
We are going to get into the Skype line soon, but first we want to cover this week's classic

1308
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,120
game of the week.

1309
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,840
Now, Dark Soccer is not here this week, so I've taken it upon myself to select a classic

1310
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,040
game of the week.

1311
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,760
I believe Loki will do one for next week.

1312
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,760
Okay.

1313
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,760
You better.

1314
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,760
All right.

1315
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,760
Here is this week's classic game of the week.

1316
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,760
Oops, wrong music.

1317
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:46,360
All right, this week's classic game of the week is a game called Equinox is the classic

1318
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,360
game of the week.

1319
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:54,320
Equinox was actually the sequel to another game on the NES called Solstice 2.

1320
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,120
Solstice was the game on NES.

1321
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,520
This was kind of Solstice 2 in many ways.

1322
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:05,000
Part of the reason I totally dig this game is the fact that it was kind of like...

1323
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,520
I love the ambiance and the music in this game.

1324
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,280
It really set the mood.

1325
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,960
Basically, you have this kind of isometric view of the game.

1326
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,920
If you ever played Solstice on the NES, it was kind of very similar.

1327
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:23,200
You had this isometric view of the game, and you were going through these dungeons and

1328
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,680
kind of trying to solve all these different puzzles in the game.

1329
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,820
The ambiance that the music set was just awesome.

1330
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,700
You got these different items, and you had to fight the bosses, and they had really cool

1331
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,760
boss music in the game.

1332
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,480
I think, ironically, one of the things that was really cool about Equinox was that it

1333
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,120
was actually developed by Sony.

1334
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,800
One of the Sony spin-offs companies, Sony ImagineSoft, was actually the company that

1335
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,800
made this game.

1336
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,560
It was kind of like Sony making a game for the Super Nintendo, which is kind of cool.

1337
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,280
Of course, obviously, Sony ImagineSoft was phased out a little while later, and they

1338
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,720
went on to make games for the PlayStation.

1339
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,200
If you enjoyed Solstice on the NES, you may not even know this game existed, so it's my

1340
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,960
pick for the game of the week is Equinox.

1341
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,640
Did you guys ever play this game?

1342
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
Lowkey?

1343
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
Nope.

1344
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,640
Yeah.

1345
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,040
It required a hell of a lot of patience.

1346
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,120
It had kind of a steep learning curve, but it was a little fun once you got used to it.

1347
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,120
It did.

1348
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,240
It had a real steep learning curve to it, and it was fucking hard.

1349
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,520
The other thing about it is that it had a really precise way to kind of get through

1350
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,960
the game, and it was not very forgiving in regards to running into people and stuff.

1351
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:33,040
I don't know if it's maybe the YouTube guy playing it on an emulator or something, but

1352
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,960
why the fuck is all the text in front of...

1353
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,960
Because it's a demo.

1354
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,960
You're looking at a demo.

1355
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,960
Oh.

1356
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,960
So.

1357
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,840
You pop up on the overworld, and within two minutes you're dead.

1358
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,840
Yeah, it's tough.

1359
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,840
It's tough.

1360
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
Yeah, there were little bosses around the overworld.

1361
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,160
You know this game was actually originally developed to be an RPG.

1362
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:52,920
If you actually look on YouTube, you can find YouTube clips of this game as an RPG.

1363
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,960
You can actually see text that was cut from the game.

1364
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,320
So kind of interesting the way it's set up.

1365
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,200
So there you have it.

1366
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,840
Being asked in chat room, DMN under the guise, your mom, says, Rob, will this be on virtual

1367
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
console?

1368
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,200
And I say, Lordy, I hope so.

1369
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,360
I hope so.

1370
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,400
So Loki, you'll be bringing a classic game next week in Jamie's Absence, correct?

1371
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,400
Yeah.

1372
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,400
All right.

1373
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,400
All right.

1374
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,400
This is the part of the show then.

1375
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,400
It is a short show tonight.

1376
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,120
We want to cram it all into one segment, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype

1377
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,120
lines.

1378
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:29,180
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1379
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,720
And folks have been hammering the phones already.

1380
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,440
I believe we already have a call on the line.

1381
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,440
Call are you there?

1382
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,440
Hi, Rob.

1383
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,440
Hi.

1384
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,440
Is this Jamie?

1385
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,440
Yes, it is.

1386
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,440
Hi, Jamie.

1387
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,440
How are you?

1388
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,780
I'm looking at the rain right now.

1389
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,400
Is it raining where you're at?

1390
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,040
Oh, yeah, it's raining.

1391
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,040
Of course.

1392
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,040
So I'm sure...

1393
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,040
I am...

1394
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,040
I'm sorry.

1395
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,040
I know you're...

1396
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,040
I'm...

1397
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,040
Oh, go ahead.

1398
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,040
I'm just saying I'm calling from Alabama.

1399
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,040
Well, how has things been going out there?

1400
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,040
How was your Thanksgiving?

1401
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,560
We had it yesterday, and the mom cooked for a small army, but thankfully a small army

1402
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,960
showed up, and then they went off to kick butt for me.

1403
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,960
Nice.

1404
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,240
And it was pretty cool.

1405
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,400
And we've just been doing a lot of hanging out.

1406
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:15,760
I haven't gotten much played, but I did watch a movie that a lot of people on the Half-Life

1407
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,000
and Portal boards were saying that they thought Portal might have been based off of.

1408
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,160
I had mentioned to you earlier it was Cube.

1409
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,040
Oh, the movie Cube.

1410
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,360
Yeah, that movie's cool.

1411
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,360
I love that movie.

1412
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,360
I saw it a long time ago.

1413
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,440
But there are some real bastardized sequels to the movie, from what I understand.

1414
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,200
I haven't seen them, so I guess I should withhold my final opinion until I see them, but I've

1415
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,360
heard the sequels are not good.

1416
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,960
Hypercube is a mindfuck.

1417
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,480
Hypercube and Cube Zero.

1418
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,480
Yes.

1419
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,480
I'm supposed to be watching while I'm here.

1420
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,480
Oh, nice.

1421
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,480
Very nice.

1422
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,480
Have you gotten any gaming done while you've been out there?

1423
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,480
Not really.

1424
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,880
I haven't had much of a chance to.

1425
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:55,840
I did bring my Game Boy with me, and actually on the plane, I tried to play Olendan, because

1426
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,840
I've got puppies.

1427
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,840
Copy.

1428
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,840
Nice.

1429
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,840
Olendan's a fun game play.

1430
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,840
Not much else.

1431
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,560
I almost logged into Ragnarok once at this Wi-Fi place that we found.

1432
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,560
Very cool.

1433
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,560
It was pending.

1434
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,560
No, it didn't.

1435
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,560
I resisted the urge.

1436
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,920
If I sounded a little distracted during the Classic Game of the Week segment, that's because

1437
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,920
I was actually trying to pick up Jamie's call, but I was curious, did you hear the Classic

1438
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,920
Game of the Week segment?

1439
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,480
Did I pick a worthy game this week?

1440
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,520
Did you say you picked Psychonauts?

1441
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:28,400
No, it was Equinox, which was Solstice II on the Super Nintendo, basically.

1442
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,960
I was like, that wasn't on Super Nintendo.

1443
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,360
No, no, Equinox.

1444
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,360
No.

1445
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,360
How?

1446
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,760
Equinox, which was much, well, I like Psychonauts, too.

1447
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,440
I can't say it's much cooler, but it was a very cool game.

1448
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,760
I was just curious if I picked a worthy game this week.

1449
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,160
I'd say you did.

1450
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,440
That's a pretty good one.

1451
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,440
Awesome.

1452
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,440
The other thing-

1453
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,440
Get my Samsung approval.

1454
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,440
Good.

1455
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:55,440
Good.

1456
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,440
I'm always looking for that.

1457
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:01,420
Loki, tell Jamie a little bit about the story we covered earlier in the evening.

1458
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:05,600
There's apparently a girl Grand Theft Auto type of game coming out, and Loki, what is

1459
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,080
it you can do in this game?

1460
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,960
You can do drugs.

1461
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:16,040
You can also have sex with people for your own personal gain, spread rumors, stuff like

1462
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,040
that.

1463
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,200
Does this sound like the female Grand Theft Auto to you, doing drugs and pulling people's

1464
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,200
hair?

1465
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,200
No.

1466
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:28,040
See, my perfect version would be this hardcore chick with an- we actually described him watching

1467
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,040
Planet Terrace.

1468
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,040
It would be worth a gallon.

1469
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,360
And it's developed by a company called Champagne for the Ladies.

1470
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,740
That's so stupid.

1471
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,740
What about-

1472
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,740
Okay.

1473
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:41,960
Wait, who would be cooler, Rose McGowan or Tank Girl?

1474
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,320
Ooh, that's a hard one.

1475
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,800
That's a hard, hard one.

1476
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,120
I don't know, Tank Girl's pretty hardcore, but she'd have to have the tanks.

1477
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,120
That's true.

1478
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,080
I think they should just make a Tank Girl video game, honestly.

1479
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,080
That would be great.

1480
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,080
Yeah, we were going to when it got canceled.

1481
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,080
Doh.

1482
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,080
Of course, she would have to do all the art work.

1483
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,080
Yeah, I'm an original PlayStation.

1484
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,080
All right.

1485
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,760
Well, Ms. Dark Sakura, sorry you couldn't be here tonight, but you're going to miss

1486
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,280
the great Wee Zapper Challenge, which is taking place after the show.

1487
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,240
But we'll look forward to your return in a couple weeks.

1488
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,520
Is there anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

1489
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:18,520
I've already been challenged by Wee Zapper.

1490
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,360
I fell on my foot before I left.

1491
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,120
Well, congratulations on that.

1492
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,380
I'm actually watching Eddie Izzard right now.

1493
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:27,040
I hope the same doesn't happen to me.

1494
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,440
Well, then go enjoy the Eddie Izzard.

1495
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,440
All right.

1496
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,440
All right.

1497
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,440
Take care.

1498
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,440
Bye, everybody.

1499
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,440
Bye.

1500
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,440
We'll be back in two weeks.

1501
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,440
Bye-bye.

1502
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,520
Jamie was very patient waiting on hold while I was doing the Classic Game of the Week,

1503
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,520
so I appreciate that.

1504
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,520
All right.

1505
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
Let's go to the phones again.

1506
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,040
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you can call, or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

1507
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,360
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1508
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,520
Who's this?

1509
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:50,520
It's Ravenstaufen.

1510
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:51,520
Hello, Ravenstaufen.

1511
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,880
How are you?

1512
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,880
I am okay.

1513
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,440
A little cramped in here.

1514
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,440
Little cramped?

1515
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,440
Yeah.

1516
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,560
My house is being renovated.

1517
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,320
It's worked on, so I'm in a cramped little room right now.

1518
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,640
Oh, I thought maybe you had the whole Thanksgiving family thing going on.

1519
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,720
No, it was quiet, but enough about that.

1520
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:14,440
My show can't stop talking about the damn Orange Box since it damn came out pissing

1521
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,440
me off.

1522
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,440
Why is that?

1523
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,440
Well, damn.

1524
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,440
What's so damn great about it?

1525
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,240
Because I haven't been playing it.

1526
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,320
That's all they've been talking about.

1527
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,080
Don't you have control over it?

1528
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,520
Can't you just say, hey, no more Orange Box?

1529
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,560
I tried, and then they go like, no.

1530
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,560
We got to play Portal.

1531
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,560
Portal is awesome.

1532
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:34,560
Ravenstaufen.

1533
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,560
And then Game Portraits is awesome.

1534
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,760
And then I'm like, you haven't played it very much.

1535
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,400
It's like, yeah, it's very hardcore.

1536
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,680
Yeah, it's very hardcore.

1537
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,520
Offer them a cake if they shut up.

1538
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,280
Wait, now, so did you just call in tonight to bitch about your own show's politics, or

1539
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,280
what's the deal?

1540
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,280
Oh, no.

1541
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,280
Not at all.

1542
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,280
All right.

1543
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,280
What else is up?

1544
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,080
You talked about Portal and all those games.

1545
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
I guess it's your...

1546
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,560
I haven't really played them still yet.

1547
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,600
I'm like the least coolest kid on the block.

1548
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,600
So you're just like me.

1549
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,600
OK.

1550
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,600
Now you're in the same boat.

1551
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,040
Well, except Loki, one of the cool kids on the block is loaning me his copy.

1552
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,560
So maybe by next week, I'll be sitting here giggling, going, hee hee, the cake is a lie.

1553
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,480
You know, and all that stuff that everybody else is doing.

1554
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,320
So we'll see.

1555
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,040
Do you think, does this kind of stuff kind of irritate you when people go too far?

1556
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,040
It does.

1557
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,040
It pisses me off.

1558
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,040
Really?

1559
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
I'm sorry.

1560
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,840
It pisses me off, especially when a commercial that goes, the greatest game of all time.

1561
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,400
And with the PlayStation 3 version being very unplayable, Gabe Newell must really hate that

1562
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,400
thing.

1563
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:38,440
Apparently, there's not a lot of nice things to say about it from Valve.

1564
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,440
I love it.

1565
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,160
Technically, it's like, I hate the PlayStation 3.

1566
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,400
I'm just going to gimp it.

1567
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,400
Apparently, a lot of folks are doing that.

1568
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,400
All right.

1569
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,880
Well, any final thoughts for our listeners, Ravensdolphin?

1570
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,680
No, but don't be in a cramped room.

1571
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:55,680
All right.

1572
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,400
We'll try to avoid that, even though the studio is a little cramped.

1573
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,400
All right.

1574
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,400
Take care.

1575
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,400
Bye.

1576
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:05,240
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1577
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,280
How are you enjoying Jamie's chair tonight, Loki?

1578
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,400
I never asked.

1579
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,720
The big fluffy blue chair.

1580
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,720
It's warm.

1581
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:11,720
I don't know.

1582
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,760
But then again, that might be my cold.

1583
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,760
All right.

1584
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,000
Let's go over to the phones, take some more calls.

1585
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1586
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Who's this?

1587
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Yo, this is Preston.

1588
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
How you doing?

1589
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Hey, how you doing?

1590
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Better known as Xenocore.

1591
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Yep.

1592
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
What's up, Xenocore?

1593
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,800
Same old stuff, different day, man.

1594
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,800
Gotcha.

1595
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,800
What's your gaming week been like?

1596
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,600
Actually, first off, did you have a good Thanksgiving?

1597
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,240
Yeah, I got turkey for days, dude.

1598
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,240
Awesome.

1599
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,240
Leftovers.

1600
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,240
Turkey and then turkey everything for a whole week.

1601
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,760
Got turkey and nothing but turkey and sleeping for the next half week or so.

1602
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Gotcha.

1603
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,760
So how was your gaming week?

1604
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:45,760
What do we owe the call to tonight?

1605
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,760
Well, I've been getting all of my November 20th gaming out of the way.

1606
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,400
So finally managed to finish Assassin's Creed and saw the little cliffhanger ending they

1607
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,400
gave us there.

1608
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,960
That was kind of upsetting.

1609
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:57,960
Interesting.

1610
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,920
So did they set it up totally for a sequel, as many games do these days?

1611
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,200
Well, yeah, but there was no end of the chapter, so to speak.

1612
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,720
You just fall right off the cliff.

1613
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,600
It's pitch black and you just walk right off the cliff.

1614
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,600
OMG spoilers.

1615
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,600
Next one.

1616
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,000
Can we not spoil this?

1617
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,600
No, it doesn't sound major.

1618
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,880
What they did do is interesting.

1619
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,160
You're definitely drawn to the story, so you still want to find out what's going on, but

1620
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,040
you just hit that wall flat out.

1621
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,280
There's no gentle slope to say, okay, now wait for the next one.

1622
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,080
It's like, oh shit, now I got to go buy number two to figure out what's going on, but it's

1623
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,120
kind of interesting what they did.

1624
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,120
Interesting.

1625
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:38,440
And Assassin's Creed apparently, since it's a brand new IP, right, and it's doing very

1626
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,400
well for being a brand new IP, so it sounds like they already know there's going to be

1627
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,400
an Assassin's Creed at some point.

1628
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,720
Yeah, they're talking about the sequel.

1629
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,720
Oh, wow.

1630
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:46,720
Very cool.

1631
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,720
Anything else you've been playing as Unicorn?

1632
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,360
Yeah, I've been getting Mass Effect out the way.

1633
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,360
How is that?

1634
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Let's check that out.

1635
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,520
I'm very, very curious about Mass Effect.

1636
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,120
Well, Loki, did you play the beta version or the demo version they had at the trade

1637
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,840
shows, or did you actually play a full version of it?

1638
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,720
No, I played a full version of it.

1639
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:08,800
All right, because after the review I heard last week, I'm not sure if you were playing

1640
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,360
the same game I am, because there wasn't that much talking before I started shooting anyway.

1641
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,280
No, there's quite a bit of talking.

1642
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,640
I disagree, but anyway, I'm used to Bioware stuff, so I guess I sort of gloss over it.

1643
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,600
See, I didn't play anything from Bioware.

1644
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,600
I didn't play Jade Empire or anything like that, so maybe this...

1645
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,600
I could have been nitpicking.

1646
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:32,320
I only had 30 minutes in my lunch, and I just want to kill you while there you go, and hey,

1647
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,520
25 minutes of that lunch is spent talking.

1648
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,160
Loki, you missed alien sex.

1649
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,160
I didn't miss it.

1650
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,800
There's no fucking alien sex in there.

1651
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,760
It's implied sex.

1652
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,360
That's bullshit.

1653
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,680
Loki says fucking lifetime TV implied sex is what that is.

1654
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,760
Penetration or it didn't happen.

1655
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:56,960
Well, I can't confirm or deny that right now, because apparently, based off how far I've

1656
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,840
gotten into the game, the scene they show isn't from a party member.

1657
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,920
It's from an NPC, so if there is some party member fornicating, we haven't seen what it

1658
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,920
looks like yet.

1659
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,560
The plot thing is, apparently my friends...

1660
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,260
See, the reason why I haven't bought Mass Effect is that there's just too many games

1661
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:18,120
and not enough money in the wallet, however, one of my friends who got Mass Effect is already

1662
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,360
halfway through the game and said he'll let me borrow it as soon as he finishes it, so

1663
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,800
I'm hoping I can take a look at it for a future show.

1664
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,080
I'll eventually get around to playing it.

1665
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,000
I mean, it's just right now there's, like you said, too many things to play.

1666
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,120
I'm trying to get rid of some of this, like, I looked at Crackdown, oh yeah, my copy of

1667
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,440
Crackdown stopped working for some reason.

1668
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,720
I fucking love Crackdown.

1669
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,120
It refuses to work now.

1670
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,480
What do you think about, I know you play a lot of RPGs, Xenocore, what do you think about

1671
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,720
the conversation style in Mass Effect?

1672
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,720
Is it really cool?

1673
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,800
Is it something you'd like to see in more games?

1674
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,960
Well, it's not anything different from what they've done previously.

1675
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,840
It's still the same BioWare chat interface, they just put more visual cues and stuff in

1676
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,700
it, so there's more interaction with the characters since everybody speaks, and there's more facial

1677
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,440
animation so you can see emotion, but other than that, it's the same BioWare engine they've

1678
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,440
always been using.

1679
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,440
Nice.

1680
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,440
All right.

1681
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,880
Well, again, I'm like Loki, I didn't play the previous games, so Star Trek Amy.

1682
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:12,880
You know what, guys?

1683
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,240
I think I need to introduce you to Knights of the Old Republic, to Neverwinter Knights,

1684
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:21,440
to Jade Empire, all these BioWare games that you haven't played.

1685
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,440
None of those games I've played.

1686
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,440
You need to.

1687
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,280
And I gotta say, I realize there's a lot of folks listening to this show who think we're

1688
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:32,520
experts on everything, but we're gamers just like you guys and we don't have time for everything,

1689
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,560
but I definitely want to at least look at everything if I have a chance.

1690
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,720
That's why I miss E3, because at E3 you can at least look at everything and kind of go,

1691
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,960
yeah, I'm more interested in this or I'm not so interested in this, so yeah.

1692
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,960
All right.

1693
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,760
Well, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1694
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,320
Yeah, just one other point on Mass Effect, the rover kicks ass.

1695
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,760
I mean, the Warthog is shit now.

1696
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,840
The Land Rover you get to use in Mass Effect is the new ride I want, man.

1697
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,840
Interesting.

1698
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,000
There's so much detail put into the way that vehicle just operates.

1699
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,240
I can just drive it all day on the planets and stuff, it's great.

1700
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,240
Very cool.

1701
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:11,320
I mean, it's kind of interesting hearing about a lot of big games of the year getting compared

1702
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:15,040
to Halo 3 where it looks like Halo 3 may not be the game of the year.

1703
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,740
There's all these other games that are doing these other little things, whereas a lot of

1704
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:20,640
folks kind of thought Halo 3 may take the ground.

1705
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,040
It may not, but we'll see.

1706
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,880
Yeah, it's because it's Halo 2.5 and not Halo 3.

1707
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,120
That may be it right there.

1708
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,120
All right.

1709
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,200
Well, Xenocore, we got to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in before we go,

1710
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
but thank you so much for calling, okay?

1711
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,200
No problem.

1712
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,200
Take it easy, guys.

1713
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,200
All right.

1714
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,200
Take care, buddy.

1715
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,720
If you want to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

1716
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,320
Don't be deterred if you go straight to voicemail.

1717
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,000
If you're going straight to voicemail, it's just because we're on another call, so don't

1718
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,720
cry if you get voicemail.

1719
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,880
Meanwhile, some last-minute stories real quick if we have any.

1720
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,560
Omega 5 is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.

1721
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,560
Oh.

1722
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,120
Looking for a kick-ass shooter.

1723
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,920
Wait, that's not the same thing as the Omega Warhawk expansion.

1724
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:02,920
No.

1725
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:03,920
Omega 5.

1726
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:04,920
Oh.

1727
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,320
It's a Hudson shooter.

1728
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,320
Interesting.

1729
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,320
All right.

1730
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,320
Hello.

1731
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,320
You're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

1732
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,320
Who's this?

1733
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,320
What's up?

1734
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,320
This is Dillinger.

1735
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,320
Hi, Dillinger.

1736
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,320
I'm usually 3ama, but I kind of felt like a name change.

1737
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,320
All right.

1738
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,320
Well, hey.

1739
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,320
You know what?

1740
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,320
When it's your nickname, you have the right to do that.

1741
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,520
You're a little bit quiet, so make sure you get a little closer to your mic and tell us

1742
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,520
what's on your mind.

1743
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,520
All right.

1744
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,880
I wanted to talk a bit about Mario Galaxy.

1745
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:37,960
I've basically been playing it over the entire Thanksgiving break, and I've got to say that

1746
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,200
if you've got a Wii, you have to buy this game.

1747
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:46,840
It is kind of childish, and it's a bit easy at the beginning, but once you really get

1748
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:51,000
into the game, especially the later stuff, you only have to have... It's another one

1749
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,920
of the... There's 120 stars that you can get, and you only have to have 60 to go to

1750
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:03,480
the final boss, but the final 60 is just... It is better than everything else in the game.

1751
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,360
It is better than a lot of the stuff in Mario 64, in my opinion.

1752
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,200
There's some really innovative stuff in there.

1753
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:16,180
I think that Mario Galaxy is basically the definite game to get for the Wii.

1754
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:19,760
You know, it's kind of interesting because I can hear the excitement in your voice when

1755
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,240
you're talking about games, and when you hear that excitement, it makes other people excited,

1756
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:29,520
so certainly I liked the bits of Mario Galaxy that I have played so far.

1757
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,400
I haven't bought the full game yet, but I'm kind of curious.

1758
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,560
What did you think about the motion in that game, meaning like, you know how it was more

1759
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,120
of a round environment?

1760
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,280
I kind of thought it was a game where I'd be able to get disoriented very easily, even

1761
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,000
more so than most 3D games.

1762
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Do you find that?

1763
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,920
Was it kind of hard to kind of figure out where you were at in the game, or was it something

1764
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,440
you just kind of pick up as you go?

1765
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,440
Not really.

1766
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,040
I found that you get used to it after a bit.

1767
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:59,440
I mean, I've had a couple of friends over that have played it, my brothers played it,

1768
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:03,680
and it's a little weird in the beginning, obviously, because you're getting used to

1769
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:09,600
this whole new orientation, but after a little bit, you really get used to it.

1770
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,600
Have you tried any of the co-op mode?

1771
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,320
Because I know you said you had your friends over, and I noticed in a commercial I saw

1772
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,340
the other day, they were really hyped in the co-op mode.

1773
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,800
How is it?

1774
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,560
Co-op isn't really anything great.

1775
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:24,360
All that you can do is you can move your wiimote around and you can collect the stars for them,

1776
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:29,440
or you can stun the enemies, or actually you can make them jump, so it's great, because

1777
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,520
you can really mess around with your friends.

1778
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,440
They'll be trying to jump somewhere, and you can tell them to jump earlier.

1779
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,740
It's pretty stupid, but it's good for a lot.

1780
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:40,880
Very cool.

1781
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,960
Anything else on the Wii that you're looking forward to this holiday season, besides Super

1782
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:44,960
World?

1783
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:45,960
Trauma Center.

1784
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:46,960
I'm a huge Trauma Center guy.

1785
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,200
I loved Second Opinion.

1786
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,520
I never played the DS one.

1787
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:56,320
I sold my DS before it came out, but I'm really looking forward to New Blood.

1788
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,160
I know it's already out, but I also really want to get Geometry Wars.

1789
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:06,040
I played it once at my friend's house on Xbox, the 360 off of the live arcade or whatever

1790
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,600
the hell it's called, and it was tons of fun.

1791
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,220
I'm a really huge Gretsch guy, so I'm looking forward to that.

1792
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,880
We interviewed the developers a couple weeks ago on the show, and it's going to be interesting,

1793
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:22,800
because they are changing the way it works for the Wii, incorporating the motion control,

1794
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,680
so I'm kind of excited to see how that works.

1795
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,680
Oh, god.

1796
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,240
Was that episode 251?

1797
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,080
I don't remember which episode it was.

1798
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,080
About three weeks ago.

1799
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,080
Try 254, 253.

1800
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,080
I think it was in there somewhere.

1801
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,280
It's probably still on iTunes.

1802
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,120
I vaguely remember you guys doing an interview in Part B of 251.

1803
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,440
I don't remember if it was that or what, but yeah, it's somewhere in there, so check it

1804
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,440
out.

1805
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,440
What was the other thing I wanted to say?

1806
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,320
Trauma Center is a game I like as well, and that reminds me, that's something I want to

1807
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:52,120
look at, too, is the new Trauma Center game, because it's not just a DS port, like it was

1808
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,120
actually made for the Wii.

1809
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,120
Yeah, I heard it got good reviews.

1810
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,120
Oh, I'm excited.

1811
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,120
I got to check that out.

1812
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,640
Above average reviews.

1813
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,320
That was a great game for the Wii.

1814
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,120
I will never forget, because I didn't really play the DS one either.

1815
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,240
I kind of skipped it when it came on DS, but I played it on Wii.

1816
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:07,440
I will never forget the first time you have to use the defibrillators, and you're like

1817
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,720
clear, and you have to actually push towards the screen.

1818
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:11,720
It's great.

1819
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:12,720
I love Trauma Center.

1820
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,720
I need to check that out, too.

1821
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,720
All right.

1822
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,720
Well, Dillinger, thanks so much for the call.

1823
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:20,360
We've got to take a couple more calls, but any quick final thoughts for our listeners?

1824
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,360
Quick final thoughts.

1825
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,280
Dragon Force is the greatest band ever.

1826
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,680
I mean, I freaked out when I heard that they were going to be in Guitar Hero 3, even though

1827
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,200
I can't be through the fire and the plans aren't expert.

1828
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,200
Rock on.

1829
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,200
I agree.

1830
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,200
Dragon Force is amazing.

1831
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,360
I still want them on the show.

1832
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,360
We'll see.

1833
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,760
Maybe that'll be my Christmas present.

1834
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,760
We'll see.

1835
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,760
That'd be great.

1836
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:41,760
All right.

1837
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,760
We'll see you later.

1838
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,760
It was nice to have you on the program.

1839
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:44,760
You, too.

1840
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,920
And have fun with Mario Galaxy, and good luck in getting all those 120 what-have-you stars

1841
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,320
that are in that game.

1842
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,740
It's nuts.

1843
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:55,480
Any other last-minute stories you got for us, Logie?

1844
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:56,480
There's one I forgot.

1845
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:02,240
I didn't make show roll for some reason, but Night's Journey into Dreams is coming to the

1846
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,760
PlayStation 2, the original Night's that was on the Saturn.

1847
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:07,760
Nice.

1848
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,360
You know, I think probably it didn't make the show roll because we had a short show

1849
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,360
tonight, but I'm glad.

1850
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,120
Well, I didn't put it on there, so.

1851
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,120
Oh, well, then.

1852
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,120
I forgot.

1853
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,120
All right.

1854
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,760
No, I do remember reading that, though, so very cool.

1855
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,440
Let's go to one more call for tonight.

1856
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:21,440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1857
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,440
Who's this?

1858
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,320
Aww, caller, are you there?

1859
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,720
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1860
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:30,920
If you're there, say hello.

1861
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:38,760
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

1862
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,760
Caller's not there.

1863
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,120
Folks, you want to use Echo 1-2-3 to test your connection before you give us a call,

1864
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,160
or you could just use a regular telephone as well.

1865
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,160
That always works.

1866
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:54,800
Always got to love when the last call tonight is something that fails.

1867
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,800
Anyhow, let's go ahead and wrap up.

1868
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,920
On that note, let's wrap up the show tonight.

1869
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,880
So we're going to do our challenge on Op 11, yes?

1870
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,280
We're going to do our crossbow challenge?

1871
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,280
Yes, you're welcome.

1872
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,280
Awesome.

1873
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,840
Let's go around and hear everybody's final thought.

1874
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,400
If there's no other last minute stories, let's go around and hear everybody's final

1875
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,400
thought.

1876
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,400
Drew, thanks for filling in tonight.

1877
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,040
Sorry you got robbed of half a show, but come back.

1878
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,040
Oh, I will.

1879
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,040
I will.

1880
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:26,040
And you did get to peek at what we have coming in 2008 out in the, well, we don't call it

1881
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,040
a garage.

1882
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,040
We call it a new studio.

1883
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,040
What do you think?

1884
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,040
It'll be interesting.

1885
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,040
I am impressed.

1886
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,920
I hope that it all goes well.

1887
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:33,920
I hope so.

1888
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:34,920
We'll see.

1889
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,720
Did you change something since I last looked for it?

1890
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,720
No.

1891
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,800
It's kind of funny stuff, but kind of just explaining the concepts and what we hope to

1892
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,800
have up.

1893
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,800
So this would be very cool.

1894
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,240
It's kind of like, remember when you and I shared a place, we had a lot of cool stuff

1895
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,240
there we haven't had since?

1896
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:47,240
Yeah.

1897
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,240
Like a TV and stuff?

1898
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,240
We had to destroy that.

1899
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,240
We're going to have it back.

1900
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,240
Oh, poor thing.

1901
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,240
All right, your final thoughts.

1902
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,240
Drew, did I get your final thoughts?

1903
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,240
No.

1904
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,240
Then what's your final thoughts, Drew?

1905
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,640
I needs my wow.

1906
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,640
Addict.

1907
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,640
Loki.

1908
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:04,720
I feel hot and I hope I don't have a fever because that would suck.

1909
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:11,280
And my final thought is I want more pumpkin pie and then I don't like pumpkin coffee and

1910
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,280
pumpkin everything.

1911
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,720
I want pumpkin everything.

1912
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,720
That's what I want.

1913
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:20,460
