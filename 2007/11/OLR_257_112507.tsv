0	21000	Tonight, November 25th, 2007, Guitar Hero gets sued for sounding too good, Super Mario Galaxy
21000	31880	has super sales, and Captain Kirk officially endorses World of Warcraft.
31880	35800	Hello everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35800	40080	We are that video game program dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming
40080	41520	culture and the gamer lifestyle.
41520	46880	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me not tonight is Dark Sakura, she has the night off, she's
46880	49320	off for the holidays in Alabama.
49320	51760	We might hear from her a little bit later though, we'll see.
51760	54320	But joining us in studio, say hello to the one and only Loki.
54320	55320	Hello.
55320	56680	How you doing, Loki?
56680	57680	I'm doing fine.
57680	62440	Alright, and since we had an extra seat tonight, we thought we'd bring back a familiar guest.
62440	65320	For those that have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for some time, say hello to intern
65320	66720	Drew is here tonight.
66720	67720	What's up guys?
67720	68720	How you doing?
68720	69720	Ah, fair.
69720	70720	Good.
70720	73760	So Drew, since Dark Sakura's not here tonight, we are going to be relying on you to present
73760	75700	the female perspective of gaming.
75700	77400	Wouldn't that be your job, Rob?
77400	78400	No.
78400	79400	What are you trying to imply?
79400	80400	Trying to say something?
80400	81400	Oh, nothing.
81400	82400	Nothing at all.
82400	83400	That's what I thought.
83400	84400	Alright.
84400	85400	Let's get it started tonight.
85400	89600	We're going to talk about how is your gaming week, and since Jamie's not here, we'll start
89600	91160	with Loki.
91160	93160	Well, let's see.
93160	96520	My gaming week was not filled with Rock Band.
96520	102080	You'd be surprised I didn't really play Rock Band this week, and instead, like Guitar Hero
102080	107420	and all the other music games before them, they are sitting in a nice bundle in a box
107420	112480	or whatever in the corner of the room while I play other things.
112480	115800	We played actually some Project Gotham Racing 3 this week, and we did a little multiplayer
115800	116800	on that.
116800	117800	Wait.
117800	118800	Project Gotham Racing 3?
118800	119800	3.
119800	120800	Old school.
120800	124400	Well, it's the reason why we played that one instead of 4 is because I have five copies
124400	128240	of Project Gotham Racing 3 and not five copies of Project Gotham Racing 4.
128240	132280	It makes it a little difficult to play that game multiplayer otherwise.
132280	139760	Anyways, so we did that, and then scenes were, of course, as usual, and a little bit of Call
139760	145960	of Duty 4 multiplayer, which is fun, a little bit of Catan, because that's also fun, and
145960	151960	then the game I've been mainly playing the last few days is Zelda Phantom Hourglass,
151960	160880	because originally I had DS, and then it was a nice silver fat one that came out at launch,
160880	163840	and then the music came on and everything went to hell.
163840	165680	I sort of got everything's broken tonight.
165680	168920	Those who were listening live tonight, we had to do three retakes to start the show
168920	169920	tonight.
169920	170920	It's like Jamie's not here.
170920	171920	It all falls apart.
171920	172920	I don't know what the hell's going on.
172920	173920	Sorry.
173920	174920	Here we go again.
174920	183100	Anyways, so then, let's see, so yeah, basically I ended up trading my silver DS fat for a
183100	192160	pink DS Lite for my wife, and then I bought a non-pink DS Lite for myself, a black one,
192160	196160	so now I have my true official game for myself, because my wife has claimed all the other
196160	197160	ones.
197160	200040	What else did I play this week?
200040	202200	I think that's about it, really.
202200	203960	I haven't been playing too much stuff.
203960	207320	I imagine because of the holidays and all, everybody's gaming weeks was a little bit
207320	208320	abbreviated.
208320	209320	Yeah, yeah, I guess.
209320	211440	Did you have a good turkey day?
211440	213240	Yeah, we had two turkeys.
213240	214240	A pig?
214240	215240	No, no, no.
215240	216240	Show off.
216240	218120	We did not eat two turkeys.
218120	219440	We had two turkeys.
219440	220440	I see.
220440	221440	One of them was at the table.
221440	226920	No, we had, because it's an interesting story.
226920	232640	We had things given over at Nellie's parents' house, and they had bought a turkey, and then
232640	234720	Nellie's dad won a turkey at work.
234720	240960	The ironic thing is he doesn't like turkey, but he won one anyways, so they had two turkeys
240960	241960	there.
241960	244760	You know, that's funny, because I don't like turkey either, so they always have to make
244760	245760	ham.
245760	249600	You know, turkey's not bad, it's just like, I don't want to, you know, they were trying
249600	254120	to feed me tons of that turkey, and I'm like, fuck this, I'm not eating all that.
254120	256680	Oh, then they wanted me to carve the turkey, and I'm like, I don't know how to fucking
256680	257680	carve a turkey.
257680	260120	I'll give them my best try, but shit.
260120	263520	So yeah, that was my gaming week.
263520	264520	Nice.
264520	266520	Drew, Intern Drew, you want to go next?
266520	267520	Sure.
267520	272360	Well, I haven't been playing much World of Warcraft since my subscription expired, cry,
272360	276560	but surprisingly I've been involved in FPS.
276560	282080	I've been playing Battlefield 2 and getting my ranking up all the way to Sergeant so far,
282080	285840	which is kind of cool, I like playing a medic.
285840	292900	Other than that, second playthrough of Tales of Symphonia, catching in some Twilight Princess
292900	298880	and a little Wild Arms 4, not much spectacular, but it's fun stuff.
298880	300680	Alrighty.
300680	305280	My gaming week, let's see, I've been playing the brand new Final Fantasy XI expansion,
305280	311840	Wings of the Goddess, which, dear Square Enix, I mean, you really blew it with this, I mean,
311840	315280	I don't know what to say, now the game itself is cool, let me get to that in a minute, I'm
315280	319040	talking about the launch, okay, when you have an MMO, and you're going to launch an expansion,
319040	323220	you can expect that all your freaking players who are addicted to this game, especially
323220	327960	Final Fantasy XI people who are pretty rabid about Final Fantasy XI are going to be in
327960	331720	on this game trying to register the game, you can expect they're going to all be on
331720	333320	it once, and so what happens?
333320	340240	Their registration servers go down when it's time to get people on this game, is that literally
340240	344420	I'm sitting there having to click retry over and over and over again for like a half hour
344420	347680	and nothing happens, and that's the point where I'm like, Rob, this is really sad, you're
347680	351840	sitting here clicking your retry button over and over, and can't register the game, what?
351840	353520	Stuck at authenticating.
353520	359320	Well, basically, it was just, lots of people were hammering the servers and it was basically
359320	360760	breaking it, but I mean, you could do it.
360760	363480	Or they just thought that your copy was not authentic enough.
363480	367600	No, well, I'm looking right at it, does this not look like the real deal, hello?
367600	370360	That looks like the real deal forgery to me.
370360	375680	Here's the other thing, is that the PC version of the game was delayed, the game was supposed
375680	380000	to hit shelves on Tuesday, no, shipped Tuesday to shelf Wednesday, right?
380000	383920	And then what happens, the PC version gets delayed by a day, which means that in reality
383920	388640	it didn't come out on Thanksgiving, obviously, it came out on Black Friday, Rob, what?
388640	392160	What Final Fantasy game would it be if it weren't delayed a little bit?
392160	396720	But the fun thing is, it was only the PC version in the US that got delayed, so everybody's
396720	401040	playing Dancer and Scholar, all the people in Japan and Europe playing the new classes,
401040	404400	and all the PC players are just, hmm, tear.
404400	408480	But I mean, this is how rabid people are, okay, you look at the Final Fantasy XI forums,
408480	410960	and people are like, okay, here's what you can do.
410960	416080	You can go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game, this is a real threat I saw on
416080	421640	Wednesday, the workaround, go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game, use the key
421640	427120	to register, if you can get through the registration server, download a torrent of the European
427120	432320	PC version, and then hack the initialization file to make the European game think it's
432320	433320	the US.
433320	434320	That's the workaround.
434320	435320	That's what people were doing.
435320	436320	That's the workaround.
436320	437320	That's a workaround.
437320	438320	That is a hell of a workaround.
438320	439320	Or you just fucking wait.
439320	441640	I swear to God, you just wait.
441640	442640	Fucking addicts.
442640	443640	Just wait your turn.
443640	444920	We have to wait for our loud extension.
444920	448680	This is what I finally decided to do, was wait, but I guess people are still having
448680	449680	problems getting on there.
449680	453160	I did finally get my copy registered yesterday, I guess they fixed some servers, but they
453160	454720	kind of botched the launch.
454720	461240	As for the game itself, I was kind of hoping for a little bit more for the users that are
461240	464920	not at the end game level yet, like me, because I've been playing this game for how many
464920	469680	years yet, I can never seem to level a job past like 55 because I have extreme ADD.
469680	474660	Well, that and all the fucking level cap quests suck.
474660	477600	But I've got to say, with all the changes they've made to Final Fantasy XI, they've
477600	479320	made a lot of changes for the better.
479320	484100	They've made items not so impossible to get in many ways.
484100	487200	The economy's eh, but I don't know.
487200	490720	I think the game's made a lot of improvements, like classes have gotten changes that needed
490720	491720	it.
491720	495320	And the new classes are pretty cool, Dancer's pretty awesome and helps with small parties
495320	496320	and Scholar's kind of cool too.
496320	499640	You mean I don't have to compete with bots to get a freaking pair of lizard boots anymore?
499640	503920	Well, they're Rari X now, so it does them no good to camp Lizzie, because the boots
503920	506560	are Rari X, so if they get it, they can't sell it.
506560	510120	I would camp it and drop the boots just to piss people off.
510120	511760	That'd be awesome.
511760	515400	That's a lot of time though, you call me sad for clicking retry over and over.
515400	517560	You should play well, they'd welcome people like you.
517560	522600	I don't have time to do that stuff, I mean come on, look at my gaming week.
522600	526960	Let us go to the chat room for some comments, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
526960	530320	Rama says the World of Warcraft fans are probably just as bad, Rob.
530320	534440	I bet to some extent yes, but at least I don't remember Blizzard like buckling under pressure
534440	536100	when Burning Crusade launched.
536100	541080	They knew, okay, six million people are going to be registering the game today.
541080	542540	And I think they did alright.
542540	547600	I seem to remember when WoW first launched, they kind of had some bumps, but I guess they
547600	550040	didn't realize how big the game was going to be.
550040	551040	Huge.
551040	552040	Yeah.
552040	556520	Anyhow, the game itself, I need a little more time to explore the new areas, but I like
556520	558520	some of the new music and some of the old areas I went into.
558520	560520	Did they add any new areas?
560520	565960	Well, they're the old areas 20 years ago, so there's different mobs, and it's not the
565960	567800	exact same thing with different colors.
567800	571680	For instance, one of the areas I traveled to in the past, Roland Barry Fields, you go
571680	575440	to it in the past and you see like destruction, because it's supposed to be like 20 years
575440	578020	ago when the war was going on, the Crystal War was going on.
578020	580960	You see destruction, like there'll be holes in the path where it looks like cannonballs
580960	584100	have struck the path, and things like that, so it's not like the exact same thing with
584100	585100	different colors.
585100	586240	Can you go to the towns and stuff on there like that, too?
586240	591280	You can't go to Juno, but apparently you can go to the other big three, Sandoria and Winderset
591280	592280	and all that.
592280	593280	Yay, caverns of time.
593280	597920	Yes, but the Crystal War thing was written in the 11 story long before WoW was out, so
597920	599920	you can't say they did off WoW.
599920	604040	Yes, watch the intro movie sometime.
604040	607080	I know, but they've had that in since Warcraft II.
607080	608080	Can't we have both?
608080	609080	Isn't there room for both?
609080	611120	Why's it always got to be WoW versus whatever?
611120	612120	There's room for both.
612120	614720	I'm playing both right now, and not much else because of it.
614720	616080	That's because you're a double addict.
616080	619080	But I did play Rock Band, and I bought Rock Band.
619080	624960	I did not spend $170 on the Deluxe Bundle, because I just knew, like after our preview
624960	629280	last week, I was like, you know, I just don't think I'm going to want to go through the
629280	632080	setup of setting up the drums and everything this much.
632080	636080	As much as I love that guitar, I thought the guitar was a great controller, I'm kind of
636080	639320	pissed off that the companies can't play together.
639320	642480	Like, you know how that guitar won't work with Guitar Hero?
642480	643480	It will.
643480	644800	I heard there was some compatibility chart I saw.
644800	645800	Only on Playstation 3.
645800	646800	Only on PS3.
646800	648800	Well, that's actually a fuck of a lot of good.
648800	655160	Actually, if I remember correctly, I think it was, I want to say the Rock Band ones weren't
655160	658520	working on Guitar Hero 3 or something like that.
658520	662080	All I know is that the Guitar Hero 2 controller works with both, so I'm like, you know what,
662080	663520	I'll just continue to use that.
663520	666880	Even though my yellow button is starting to stick a little bit, I'll just use that.
666880	670400	Because the Rock Band songs aren't particularly hard.
670400	674040	Like I notice I'm doing way better on hard level on Rock Band than I do in Guitar Hero.
674040	679280	But I think that's just because I think it's a little bit better of a learning curve than
679280	683600	Guitar Hero, because like, in the hard difficulty on Rock Band, I notice they add the fifth
683600	687880	button, but they don't use it a lot, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero.
687880	690520	So you get some time to adjust to that.
690520	691520	I don't know.
691520	692840	Because your pinkies are weak.
692840	696500	Yeah, I haven't had as much problems adjusting to Rock Band at all.
696500	699320	But to be honest, I've only explored single player mode.
699320	703500	I have yet to make a band, so I have yet to explore that mode.
703500	706680	So I can't really give a full review on the game, other than I've enjoyed what I've seen
706680	707680	so far.
707680	710280	That's because you don't have any friends, because of how unlikable you are.
710280	713200	I want to be able to make a band for single player.
713200	716640	Like I want to be able to make my bandmates, you know?
716640	720080	That's what I was under the impression that's what you were going to be able to do, was
720080	725360	to make your own bands, and make your characters, and you can play each one individually, and
725360	729440	then have them all come together, but I guess not.
729440	731360	Because there would be no bass man.
731360	736360	Yeah, because there's no bass single player mode, which I was surprised to find out too.
736360	738740	So I guess there's little places they can improve.
738740	740480	But I love the presentation of Rock Band.
740480	745080	I love the way it looks, and how your characters get integrated into the loading screens.
745080	748480	I think that's hilarious, so very cool.
748480	752360	Other than that, not a whole lot else I've been playing because of Thanksgiving and all,
752360	753360	and mine was great.
753360	754360	Thanks for asking.
754360	755360	Very small.
755360	758200	We did not have two turkeys like at Loki's house did.
758200	759200	All right.
759200	762840	Well, that being said, let's go to some housekeeping for tonight before we get into the gaming
762840	763840	news tonight.
763840	766720	First thing we should say is that we're only going to be one part tonight.
766720	772160	There's not going to be a part B this week, reason being that because of the holidays,
772160	775960	because of Jamie's absence, and there just really wasn't a lot of gaming news this week,
775960	778960	so we decided we'd just make it a short show.
778960	781680	Apparently a lot of folks didn't think we were going to be on at all, and maybe that's
781680	784360	because I thought I said at the end of last week's show we were going to be here after
784360	785360	all, but maybe not.
785360	786360	I don't know.
786360	790120	So I know we were kind of going back and forth, so we are here this week, but only for one
790120	791120	part.
791120	792480	There will not be two parts to this week's show.
792480	798440	However, I do believe in lieu of a part B, I believe the Wee Zapper Challenge is happening
798440	799440	tonight.
799440	800440	Yes.
800440	801440	Yes.
801440	804680	So after the show, and of course this will be archived, we will be doing the Wee Zapper
804680	810080	Challenge where Loki has said that he does not need the Wee Zapper to do good in a game,
810080	811800	so he's going to play with just the normal emote.
811800	816160	I will be using the Wee Zapper, and whoever gets the higher score or what have you.
816160	818480	I don't know.
818480	820360	If I win, you have to take me out.
820360	823240	If you win, I have to take Nellie out, but what if she won't go out with me?
823240	824240	I don't know.
824240	825240	All right.
825240	826240	Then I'll buy you guys dinner or something.
826240	827240	We'll just think of something.
827240	828240	How about this?
828240	829240	We'll make it a lot easier.
829240	835280	If I win, you get me a $20 gift card to some place, restaurant or something, and if you
835280	837920	win, I'll give you a $20 gift card to some place or something.
837920	838920	All right.
838920	839920	That makes it easy.
839920	840920	Loser wears the tingle outfit.
840920	842520	No, I don't think so.
842520	845120	Well, there would have to be a tingle outfit first off.
845120	846120	No.
846120	847120	We will make one.
847120	848120	No.
848120	849120	I will get Ken to make one.
849120	850120	You kids know better.
850120	853280	You know the tingle outfit is reserved for one million copies of Eye of Judgment sold.
853280	854280	Ready?
854280	855280	Go.
855280	856280	Still waiting.
856280	857280	Still waiting.
857280	858280	I still haven't seen the MPD.
858280	862640	I actually have seen the MPD numbers come over for October, but I believe the Eye of
862640	865280	Judgment was just within that.
865280	871240	Although, in a few more weeks, we'll have the MPD numbers for November, and I'll let
871240	875040	you guys know where Eye of Judgment is standing as far as sales go.
875040	876640	On its way to a million in six months.
876640	877640	Yeah, right.
877640	878640	Sounds good.
878640	879640	All right.
879640	882000	Chat, who said you guys could come up with what the terms of the bet are?
882000	885680	Now, the chat is expressing some disappointment because they were looking forward to the Loki
885680	886680	Rob date.
886680	887680	Have I won?
887680	888680	I'll work something out.
888680	890280	I'll make them buy me dinner still.
890280	891280	Don't worry.
891280	892280	All right.
892280	894480	So, stay tuned for that after the show tonight.
894480	898520	That's really all I got for housekeeping other than, you know, stay on top of our communities.
898520	902360	We love having more folks on our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal
902360	904120	and our MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.
904120	907680	I always neglect to mention Facebook, but we do have a group on there at the OL Army,
907680	909200	so just search for OLRMY.
909200	911400	You'll find it, or Orange Lounge Radio will come up as well.
911400	915440	Sorry, Facebook, but there's just so goddamn many apps on Facebook.
915440	919520	Every day I'm getting some freaking request for, like, so-and-so wants to play Vampire
919520	920680	with you and suck your blood.
920680	921680	I'm like, bleh!
921680	922680	Sorry.
922680	923680	It's like, yeah.
923680	924680	Thanks, Drew.
924680	925680	All right.
925680	926680	So, there you have it.
926680	931080	Also, the Guitar Hero OL Army fell out of the top 100 this week, and that makes me a
931080	932080	sad panda.
932080	934440	So, we need more recruits for the Guitar Hero OL Army.
934440	935560	You can find us on GuitarHero.com.
935560	937320	You can just search for OL Army.
937320	942080	However, I will say that Richie Maniac still has the number one spot on my Xbox Live list.
942080	946160	He's on my list, and he's on the Guitar Hero OL Army, and he has, like, a million groupies.
946160	948040	Damn you and your achievement horse.
948040	953320	I think he has 2,500 groupies, which is definitely the highest I've seen, so good job.
953320	954520	All right.
954520	956040	Let's get into some gaming news, then.
956040	957680	Who's gonna start us off tonight?
957680	958680	Loki?
958680	959680	Yeah.
959680	960680	I'm gonna start us off.
960680	967640	Anyways, as we kind of teased in the intro there, the Romantics, a wonderful 80s band,
967640	975160	I guess, I'll, yeah, I'm being sarcastic there, they are suing over a cover version
975160	982180	of their song, What I Like About You, that appeared in Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s,
982180	986520	because apparently, the song sounds too much like them.
986520	994120	They want the game sales to be halted, and want accounting of all profits from the game,
994120	1001640	along with unspecified compensation and punitive damages.
1001640	1007000	So apparently, their claim is that the song is virtually indistinguishable from the authentic
1007000	1010800	version, and therefore would confuse the consumer.
1010800	1019720	But, you know, I don't know, it's like, I'm just thinking, if it's virtually indistinguishable,
1019720	1020720	then what's it matter?
1020720	1025640	It sounds like crap, and people are thinking that's the real song.
1025640	1030880	And after that, they're going to sue everyone who five stars on an expert.
1030880	1035400	You know, I would think that in the court of law, it's gonna come down, and the judge
1035400	1039160	is gonna say, can't we just all agree that this song is so 20 years ago, and you all
1039160	1040560	need to get over it?
1040560	1044960	Or the fact that they probably paid to have the licensing of that song, because I'm sure
1044960	1049880	even though they didn't get the real artist to sing it, they have the license, the rights
1049880	1050880	to the song.
1050880	1055360	Do you think it's one of those cases where, like, the record company signed it over without
1055360	1056360	them knowing?
1056360	1057360	Like, that type of thing?
1057360	1058360	Well, I'm not surprised there.
1058360	1059360	Exactly.
1059360	1061120	Didn't a similar thing happen in DDR?
1061120	1062120	Um, possibly.
1062120	1065760	Someone was saying, like, Strictly Business, but I don't see how that, that's a licensed
1065760	1069760	song off of, um, well, the thing was, well, the thing was Strictly Business is that the
1069760	1073320	original artist of the song never consented to the song being in the game, and one of
1073320	1077560	the artists went into an arcade one day and saw people playing the song, and was like,
1077560	1078860	what the hell is this?
1078860	1082680	We never said the song could be in the game, so it was, but the record company did it.
1082680	1086160	You know, Rob, they didn't raise much of a fuss when it was in, uh, Karaoke Revolution
1086160	1087160	Party.
1087160	1088160	Interesting.
1088160	1090200	And again, it wasn't a very good cover.
1090200	1095200	And plus, Karaoke Revolution doesn't quite have that pop culture recognizability that
1095200	1096200	Guitar Hero does.
1096200	1097440	Let's actually listen.
1097440	1098440	Let's hear some clips.
1098440	1103100	Here's the original version of What I Like About You by The Romantics.
1103100	1104100	It's buffering.
1104100	1105100	It's a little slow.
1105100	1118640	Okay, that song's still kind of fun.
1118640	1119640	I have to admit.
1119640	1120920	I'll bounce up and down.
1120920	1123600	All right, let's listen to what the cover sounds like.
1123600	1126080	This is by The Wave Group, and you actually can't get this in iTunes.
1126080	1129560	I'm just getting the clips actually right out of iTunes as well.
1129560	1149400	You know, I've got to say, it really does sound a lot similar.
1149400	1150400	No, it doesn't.
1150400	1151400	A little bit.
1151400	1152520	A little bit.
1152520	1153520	Not even close.
1153520	1154520	Pursuing over that?
1154520	1156520	What a crock.
1156520	1157920	Well, let's see.
1157920	1158920	Let's see.
1158920	1162240	Now, keep in mind, there's other bands that cover this.
1162240	1164080	So I just had a curiosity.
1164080	1168320	Just like a control, like when you're doing a science degree, you have to have a control.
1168320	1171400	So let's actually take a look at a completely different cover.
1171400	1177400	So from the band Kid Pop Rock and Roll Hits, here's the hit crew with What I Like About
1177400	1178400	You.
1178400	1179400	Oh, shit.
1179400	1180400	It's buffering.
1180400	1181400	Here we go.
1181400	1199360	I know, honestly, that's pretty similar too.
1199360	1204720	I thought Kidz Bop was reserved for cage match punishment.
1204720	1205720	Make the wording stop.
1205720	1206720	That wasn't Kidz Bop.
1206720	1207720	That was not Kidz Bop.
1207720	1208720	It was Kidz Pop.
1208720	1209720	Same damn thing.
1209720	1210720	Big difference.
1210720	1211720	That's a big fucking difference.
1211720	1216880	That's a P, not a B. I would also like to point out, ok, I've got one more for you
1216880	1217880	guys.
1217880	1223520	This song was also covered on an album called The Barbie Hit Mix.
1223520	1229600	See, that's Barbie singing.
1229600	1233280	Ok, I have one question.
1233280	1238280	How effective is this mic as a bludgeoning instrument of death?
1238280	1244840	Honestly, the guitars and everything sound very similar.
1244840	1246400	Why does Barbie look like one of the Olsen twins?
1246400	1247400	I'm wondering too.
1247400	1251040	I'm looking at the cover of this going, wow, Barbie got really slutty.
1251040	1252760	So there you have it.
1252760	1254760	Got really slutty?
1254760	1258120	Nim in chat says, Barbie is made of plastic, no mouth.
1258120	1259120	How does she talk?
1259120	1266240	Same in the way Britney Spears does, you know, all in the same circumstances.
1266240	1271400	I'll give you a hint kids, it's the devil.
1271400	1273520	So there you have it.
1273520	1277400	They're being sued and what do you think, Drew, what do you think, is there any weight
1277400	1278400	to this lawsuit?
1278400	1281920	Do you think the romantics have a claim here or what?
1281920	1282920	No.
1282920	1287560	No, it is not even remotely similar.
1287560	1291280	It's similar as me singing this song, okay, I mean, seriously.
1291280	1292280	Oh, oh, would you?
1292280	1293280	No, I won't.
1293280	1294280	Sorry, Rob.
1294280	1295280	You will.
1295280	1301280	No, it's just, it's stupid.
1301280	1306800	I say yes, it's similar, but at the same time, somebody who had the rights to this song agreed
1306800	1308280	to let the song in the game.
1308280	1313240	I don't, now, if it came out that, you know, the developers got no permission to use this
1313240	1317840	song whatsoever, then I would say they have a case, but seeing as I'm pretty sure they
1317840	1321560	got the rights somewhere, you know, whether that be they went directly to the record label
1321560	1325200	and never approached the band, well, then the band should take that up with the record
1325200	1326200	label.
1326200	1328640	Why are you signing our stuff over to video games that are going to remake our songs too
1328640	1332140	similarly or why didn't you just let them use the original version for more money or
1332140	1333140	what have you?
1333140	1339400	I think, you know, if the song was licensed, then go QQ some more romantics.
1339400	1343440	Or perhaps the band should have a more unique voice that can't be copied so easily.
1343440	1345800	What the fuck is wrong with that?
1345800	1350280	DMN Nourishment says in chat, bottom line, sue the record company for signing and not
1350280	1351280	Activision.
1351280	1353640	Stop fucking whining.
1353640	1356040	Nim says there's a difference between similar and same.
1356040	1360200	If it's a cover, then it's different and they are going to be made a fool of.
1360200	1364720	Escapist says I want to see Loki pop advertised on late night TV.
1364720	1368160	And Riddink 360 says Loki should sing it in the Tingle costume.
1368160	1370960	There you have it.
1370960	1372320	Lots of love for Loki singing.
1372320	1374680	I think you could put out an album that would be bigger than Shatner.
1374680	1376600	I don't want to do that.
1376600	1380280	Well, not that I could tell you where he can find clips on the internet of Loki singing,
1380280	1381760	but I'll give you a hint.
1381760	1388080	Rock band is the topic of our next story and we did something with rock band very recently.
1388080	1392680	Anyhow, rock band has opened up a store.
1392680	1393680	That's right.
1393680	1395040	There's a new store with accessories.
1395040	1398120	There's a whole drum bag you can actually buy on this story.
1398120	1402480	It's a $50 bag to basically keep that whole drum set in.
1402480	1403480	I want that.
1403480	1405040	It is kind of nice, but it's $50.
1405040	1406040	I don't care.
1406040	1407040	I want that.
1407040	1408040	Is it worth $50, though?
1408040	1409040	It is worth $50.
1409040	1410040	Do you know why, though?
1410040	1412800	Because have you ever tried buying a bag for, like, consoles?
1412800	1415440	Trust me, I have numerous times.
1415440	1419880	Those fucking backpacks that they have for the Xbox 360 are, like, $70.
1419880	1421380	It's fucking ridiculous.
1421380	1422380	That looks nice.
1422380	1424920	Yeah, I got to admit, it does look kind of nice, but I don't know.
1424920	1427440	I mean, like, God, you already spent $170 on the game.
1427440	1429480	Do you really need to spend $50 more on some stupid characters?
1429480	1430480	Well, they have.
1430480	1432720	Like, you can buy actual guitars on that website and shit, like...
1432720	1433720	Yeah, I know.
1433720	1434720	There's other memorabilia.
1434720	1437800	It's like, I just bought $169 worth of fake instruments.
1437800	1440160	Let's buy some real ones, too.
1440160	1441160	Yay!
1441160	1446280	Uh, by the way, before we get to the next story, speaking of Guitar Hero, a little more
1446280	1449480	Guitar Hero, a little less rock band, did you see that thing?
1449480	1453280	And Tiger Claw was sharing this with our forum people, and he was asking me about this before
1453280	1454280	the show.
1454280	1456080	Did you see that whole Guitar Hero in the blender thing?
1456080	1457080	I love that website.
1457080	1458520	They put down the Will It Blend?
1458520	1459520	They've done Guitar Hero.
1459520	1460760	That is the question.
1460760	1462520	And they actually put the controller in the blender.
1462520	1463960	Well, half of it.
1463960	1467040	I don't mean to pose spoilers, but yes.
1467040	1468480	Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.
1468480	1470680	I love that website now.
1470680	1471680	You should check that out.
1471680	1474080	I giggled my head off watching that.
1474080	1475080	Rob.
1475080	1477760	I like how Loki used the appropriate verb.
1477760	1479000	He didn't laugh.
1479000	1481600	He giggled when he watched Will It Blend.
1481600	1482600	Rob?
1482600	1483600	Yes.
1483600	1486200	They did put Chuck Norris in the blender on that segment.
1486200	1488680	Like a cardboard cutout or something?
1488680	1489680	Action figure.
1489680	1493480	Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.
1493480	1498680	I apologize to all listeners for bringing up Chuck, but it had to be done.
1498680	1504240	I'm telling you, Hail Marys, those people that are behind the marketing of that blender
1504240	1505640	are fucking geniuses.
1505640	1509040	That is absolutely the best thing.
1509040	1510620	That's the entry level blender.
1510620	1512560	You can get one that's more powerful than that.
1512560	1514640	You can dispose bodies in that thing.
1514640	1517640	It's $250.
1517640	1518640	No one's buying it.
1518640	1519640	Everyone's watching it.
1519640	1520640	I thought it was $600.
1520640	1521640	It used to be $600.
1521640	1524160	It could be a restaurant caliber thing.
1524160	1527680	No, it used to be $600 and now it's $399, just like the PS3.
1527680	1534240	But it can be yours for four low payments of $99.99, just like the PS3 or the iPhone.
1534240	1537560	Nim in chat, chat.orangelandrager.com, if you're listening to us live on this Sunday
1537560	1540040	evening says, Chuck Norris doesn't blend.
1540040	1543000	Chuck Norris blends blenders.
1543000	1544460	Let's not start this.
1544460	1545460	I'm sorry.
1545460	1546460	Yes, please.
1546460	1547460	Let's not.
1547460	1549800	Let's move on to the next story, quickly.
1549800	1556960	Anyways, speaking of blending, someone I'd love to throw into that wonderful high powered
1556960	1563480	blender, Senator Hillary Clinton and of course some other folks like Joe Lieberman.
1563480	1567720	These opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the station or other staff
1567720	1568800	members of Warren's Laundry.
1568800	1572160	But they're the majority of the studio.
1572160	1580080	Senator Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Sam Brownback, and even Bay, I guess, have sent
1580080	1588040	letters to the ESRB asking for a thorough review of Manhunt 2 following the whole, you
1588040	1593480	know, unlocked content, do the hack in the game.
1593480	1598760	Apparently they think because they're like political types that the ESRB would go, okey
1598760	1599760	dokey.
1599760	1604480	They couldn't do her job the first time or something.
1604480	1609120	And actually the other thing that they're also wanting done is because they're a little
1609120	1613560	bit pissed off at the whole Wii controls and how you can murder people using the Wii remote,
1613560	1618840	they want the Wii games to be rated differently because of such things like that.
1618840	1623320	So they want that taken into consideration for future ratings.
1623320	1627240	Because you know you can still aim a gun with a mouse.
1627240	1630960	Escapist in chat says, sweet Jesus, is Manhunt 2 even selling that well?
1630960	1631960	My thoughts exactly.
1631960	1635280	No, I can tell you right now it's not.
1635280	1637960	Honestly, I don't understand the point of it.
1637960	1642160	I mean, and doesn't fucking Hillary Clinton have better things to do?
1642160	1643160	No.
1643160	1644160	Seriously.
1644160	1649080	Well, I heard she's running for president.
1649080	1652000	I know, doesn't she have better things to do?
1652000	1654080	I really hope she wins.
1654080	1658360	Well, if I remember right though, it's not just her, but she did band together with these
1658360	1659360	other folks.
1659360	1661360	It's a multi-partisan thing.
1661360	1666560	I think this goes back to the fact that politicians generally are a little bit ignorant about
1666560	1667560	this stuff.
1667560	1669120	See, that's why I don't understand this.
1669120	1674220	Four letters from politicians and they want results, yet if I send them four letters to
1674220	1678640	shut the fuck up, then you're not going to do it either, so why should they listen to
1678640	1679640	them?
1679640	1680640	I don't know.
1680640	1685080	Well, maybe someone the ESRB should listen to is Mr. T, because goddamn it, everybody
1685080	1686080	should listen to Mr. T.
1686080	1687080	Right.
1687080	1688080	Boom.
1688080	1691000	And if that is true, then everybody will soon own a copy of World of Warcraft, because there
1691000	1695680	are brand new commercials featuring Mr. T and William Shatner for World of Warcraft.
1695680	1696680	Hilarious.
1696680	1697680	And they're pretty...
1697680	1698680	Like the Night Elf Mohawk.
1698680	1702240	They're very interesting, because yeah, in the commercial, and I'm not going to play
1702240	1707680	it because Blizzard isn't paying us to play it, but in the commercial, Mr. T talks about
1707680	1712800	how he fantasizes himself as a Night Elf Mohawk, even though there isn't actually a Mohawk
1712800	1713800	in the game.
1713800	1717800	And William Shatner is a shaman, a torn shaman, which is a very interesting one.
1717800	1721960	Go figure, he's been nerfed to hell.
1721960	1725000	Apparently Mini-Me has filmed a commercial as well.
1725000	1727080	Verne Troyer has also filmed one.
1727080	1728960	I hope to God he's a gnome.
1728960	1731320	You better believe he's a gnome.
1731320	1732320	That's all I have to say.
1732320	1733320	I hope to God he's a gnome.
1733320	1735320	No, I think they're going to do the ironic thing where he's going to play a very tall
1735320	1736320	character.
1736320	1737920	He's going to die.
1737920	1738920	Lame.
1738920	1743360	I already got Shatner as a Torrin.
1743360	1751000	See here, on a completely different note, Warcraft may be taking over PCs, but one game
1751000	1756480	that's taking over PlayStation 3 would be Warhawk, and they're getting their first expansion
1756480	1757480	here pretty soon.
1757480	1763480	It's supposed to be out sometime during December, and it's going to be called Operation Omega
1763480	1764480	Dawn.
1764480	1765480	Lame title.
1765480	1774640	And it's going to be filled with some cool stuff, including new vehicles, a KT-424 combat
1774640	1780600	drop ship, and a new battlefield, the Omega Factory, and there's going to be some nighttime
1780600	1782520	based battles as well.
1782520	1783520	So...
1783520	1784520	Oh.
1784520	1786920	A few cliched titles.
1786920	1793440	Well, it's nice to see that they're expanding their games, what few they have, so more power
1793440	1794440	to them.
1794440	1795440	I agree.
1795440	1800240	I mean, there's a lot of dumb titles out there in video gaming, so titles aren't everything,
1800240	1803280	it's the gameplay that's going to be important in this expansion.
1803280	1806200	And Chat, I love you guys, we're already subverting it.
1806200	1807200	What?
1807200	1808200	What did they say in Chatroom?
1808200	1809200	They're already subverting it.
1809200	1810200	Who?
1810200	1811200	They're already subverting the title name.
1811200	1812200	Who and what?
1812200	1813200	Chatroom.
1813200	1814200	Who, specifically, and what?
1814200	1821600	We have Nim calling it Omega Dump, Sashil Omega Dumb, Omega Dong, Omega Gong.
1821600	1824520	How mature!
1824520	1826000	Omega Penis!
1826000	1830560	Whoa, did we just make our first penis joke.
1830560	1832440	Probably not the last.
1832440	1840360	Speaking of jokes, the PlayStation 3 version of the Orange Box may be pretty hilarious.
1840360	1841560	Apparently the...
1841560	1844720	Thank you, Drew, for that very scary maniacal laughter.
1844720	1846040	What the hell was that?
1846040	1847280	That was my evil laugh.
1847280	1848280	That apparently was the evil...
1848280	1849280	Wow.
1849280	1851480	That was the evil, I am laughing at you, PS3.
1851480	1854480	Oh, I'm a little scared about this.
1854480	1861360	Anyhow, the Orange Box is actually, it's not being ported by Valve, who were doing the
1861360	1863360	PC and 360 versions.
1863360	1867160	Apparently another team at EA has taken upon it to actually port this game over to the
1867160	1872640	PlayStation 3, and the earlier reports are saying, not that great.
1872640	1875200	Were they the team behind, like, Superman Returns?
1875200	1878240	Oh, God, I hope not.
1878240	1884440	Apparently there are a number of frame rate hiccups and other technical issues, which,
1884440	1891680	quote, at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable.
1891680	1894840	You know, what's interesting is if you think about other things you might have read about,
1894840	1900320	Gabe Newell, who's one of the co-founders of Valve, he's openly voiced previously, he's
1900320	1903200	not really big on the PlayStation 3.
1903200	1906600	He's called it directly a waste of everybody's time.
1906600	1908760	Oh, snap.
1908760	1914080	However, you know, the Orange Box is a pretty awesome game, which, well, going off of what
1914080	1915080	I've heard.
1915080	1917360	But Loki certainly said a lot of great things about Orange Box.
1917360	1921000	Dark Sakura loves her some Portal, she's gone frickin' crazy with Portal.
1921000	1924200	I will be playing Orange Box this week, though, because Loki's loamiest copy, so I'll let
1924200	1926000	you know next week.
1926000	1931560	But you know, whenever great games get disgraced like that, it makes us a little bit angsty.
1931560	1950440	And when we get angsty, the F.U. music comes in and we do our rants.
1950440	1953260	I'd actually like to start tonight because I'm reading chat.
1953260	1959280	I'm gonna give an F.U. to Nim, who said, Omega, two girls, one cup.
1959280	1960880	Seriously.
1960880	1961880	Let it go.
1961880	1964340	Seriously, let it go on both ends of that.
1964340	1968000	I don't really have anything else to really say F.U. to, so I guess you get that.
1968000	1971560	F.U. to sleeping until one today, that was pretty awesome.
1971560	1979000	Loki, F.U. to being sick, being stuffed up and all the other fun stuff that goes along
1979000	1980000	with it.
1980000	1987240	But, I'm gonna take tomorrow off, because I'm not feeling that well, so, you know.
1987240	1991040	You show them, I'm gonna take tomorrow off, damn straight.
1991040	1994440	Are you gonna play games while you're sick, or are you just gonna sleep, or what?
1994440	1998160	Fuck yeah, I'm playing games, that's probably what I'm gonna do.
1998160	2000880	Drew, do you have any F.U.s of the week you'd like to share?
2000880	2004120	F.U. to Loki's SARS.
2004120	2005120	I don't have SARS.
2005120	2007120	I hope it's not contagious.
2007120	2013600	F.U. to people in Battlefield 2 who insist I fly a helicopter even though I have no idea
2013600	2015040	how to fly a helicopter.
2015040	2020840	F.U. to not having all these wonderful PC games that are coming out lately, and F.U.
2020840	2022840	to not being able to feed my wow addiction.
2022840	2027400	Well, you just need to have, you know, Tank upload a program for you to learn how to fly
2027400	2028400	a combat helicopter.
2028400	2031360	Ooh, points for the Matrix reference.
2031360	2035600	Alright, I guess that's gonna do it for the F.U.s of the week.
2035600	2037480	Incredibly nerdy, thanks to Drew being here.
2037480	2041320	You know what's funny is, we're having that guy, Joe Pantalone, I think, coming in.
2041320	2044000	The guy that played Cypher.
2044000	2045000	He's coming in to our work.
2045000	2048240	But that guy, he's that guy, you don't really know his name, but like in every mob movie
2048240	2049240	he plays.
2049240	2050240	A mob guy.
2050240	2051240	A mob guy, yeah, yeah.
2051240	2053240	Or he plays, or he, no.
2053240	2056680	Well, I don't know where, how do you put it?
2056680	2057680	What was that movie?
2057680	2058680	Memento.
2058680	2066320	Yes, he's in Memento, and Sopranos, and, oddly enough, The Princess Diaries.
2066320	2069200	Not that I watched that movie or anything.
2069200	2071680	The wife probably made you do it.
2071680	2077640	It was one of those, uh, remotes way over there, it's stuck on the family channel, and
2077640	2081520	I'm like, fuck, I don't want to get up, but, lazy!
2081520	2083840	I almost watched The Princess Diaries.
2083840	2087080	I finally got up when it, you know, finished the movie, and then it started playing The
2087080	2088080	Princess Diaries again.
2088080	2089080	And you were crying.
2089080	2091720	I was like, I don't want to watch this again!
2091720	2092720	Horrible.
2092720	2093720	Okay, so what, he's going to your work?
2093720	2095440	Are you going to get an Orange Lounge Radio autograph?
2095440	2096440	You should.
2096440	2098200	Um, I don't know why he's autographing, he's coming in for this movie.
2098200	2099640	We need more stuff in the studio.
2099640	2100640	I know.
2100640	2101640	Future studio.
2101640	2102640	I know.
2102640	2104240	Coolists are fucking, like, lame.
2104240	2106240	They don't want him autographing certain things.
2106240	2109120	I wanted to bring in, like, a Matrix poster for him to sign, but...
2109120	2110640	I still vote for the steak dinner.
2110640	2111640	I don't know.
2111640	2113440	Alright, let's get back to the news.
2113440	2119760	So, yeah, you know, there's not a lot of games for girls out there that are really good,
2119760	2120880	but guess what?
2120880	2125000	That's not going to be the case anymore, Fleece, if you own a phone.
2125000	2129840	There's going to be a game called The Coolest Girl in School, which is being pitched as
2129840	2135200	Grand Theft Auto for girls, and it's being developed by, um, Champagne...
2135200	2136200	What?
2136200	2138760	Is that the actual company?
2138760	2142040	Okay, I'm sorry, but this is the actual company.
2142040	2146280	Developed by Champagne for the Ladies is the name of the...
2146280	2147960	Loki, this sounds right up your alley.
2147960	2148960	Champagne for the Ladies?
2148960	2151960	What kind of a fucking development team is that?
2151960	2156280	This sounds like the candy that strangers use to get people in their cars.
2156280	2157280	I mean...
2157280	2158280	Oh, but it gets better.
2158280	2160760	I got Champagne for the Ladies.
2160760	2165800	Every place is all the boyish drug running and random violence with stuff girls like.
2165800	2168840	Like experimenting with drugs, using sex...
2168840	2169840	What?
2169840	2175840	Using sexuality for personal gain, inclined to the top of the social order, by any means
2175840	2176840	necessary.
2176840	2178900	Shut the fuck up, where is this from?
2178900	2179900	Is this for real?
2179900	2188720	Yeah, it's, um, you can gossip, shoplifting, uh, game, you know, all sorts of things like
2188720	2189720	that.
2189720	2200840	Anyways, uh, Grisby in chat says, uh, Grand Theft Auto, Ho Island.
2200840	2201840	Now that's degrading.
2201840	2203200	Uh, it's degrading.
2203200	2208360	Apparently there's a report, though, on Canada.com, yes, they are so cool, they have their own
2208360	2209360	.com.
2209360	2215720	Um, they're writing that, uh, while the Australian Family Association deems the game toxic, uh,
2215720	2223360	and Christine Devitt of the Montreal's Concordia University calls it corrosive, that's not
2223360	2226880	really a description for a game, the folks at Champ...
2226880	2227880	Insert blame Canada jokes here.
2227880	2230960	Oh my god, it is, that is the actual development name for the company.
2230960	2235360	The folks at Champagne for the Ladies say it's all good fun.
2235360	2240320	First off, I'm sorry, but no one's going to take a company named Champagne for the Ladies,
2240320	2241320	seriously.
2241320	2245880	GS-191 has an interesting point, it's the Winona Ryder Simulator.
2245880	2252840	Uh, this is more of like a Britney Spears simulator, drugs ruin your life and all that
2252840	2253840	stuff, my god.
2253840	2259480	But, like, I don't know, tell me if it's just me, but isn't there, like, a sick side of
2259480	2264360	you that, like, kind of wants to play it when it's all said and done, like, I'm kinda like,
2264360	2268000	you know, it's like one of those things, like, I have to play it, like, before I die.
2268000	2269000	You know what?
2269000	2272840	Take two, pay attention to what they're doing in this game, that way you can add a female
2272840	2277240	character into Grand Theft Auto that you can play, and there you go, that's what women
2277240	2278240	like.
2278240	2283200	Women like using sexuality for personal games, and doing all this stuff like that.
2283200	2285640	When Jamie's not here, this is what happens.
2285640	2286640	The show gets ruined.
2286640	2287640	Alright, uh...
2287640	2291160	Since the girl-centered role-playing game puts magnifying glass into the darker side
2291160	2296960	of school life with participants encouraged to experiment with fashion, oh, experiment
2296960	2307040	with fashion, oh no, fashion, drugs, sexuality, cutting class, and spreading rumors, oh, spreading
2307040	2308040	rumors.
2308040	2310040	Anyways.
2310040	2312880	Frisbee asks, what would Jamie's comments on this be?
2312880	2313880	I don't have a clue.
2313880	2318520	If we get her on the phone later, we'll have to watch, I really don't know.
2318520	2325600	She would probably be making some sort of noise similar to this.
2325600	2329640	That's I think what Jamie would do.
2329640	2330640	Call me crazy.
2330640	2338400	Anyhow, let's get back into some real games, such as a real gamer girl, Lara Croft.
2338400	2340600	And I say that because Lara Croft has big boobs.
2340600	2342240	No, just kidding.
2342240	2345500	But of course, Lara Croft is much more of a hero than any of the characters in that
2345500	2346640	other game ever will be.
2346640	2354880	Lara Croft has come out with Tomb Raider Anniversary on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
2354880	2358320	It's actually available for 1,200 Microsoft points, that's going to set you back about
2358320	2359320	15 bucks.
2359320	2362980	Here's the thing though, you need to own Tomb Raider Legend in order to play it because
2362980	2365520	it's technically downloadable content for that.
2365520	2368560	But if you want to download the Tomb Raider Anniversary, check that out.
2368560	2370360	It's available on the Xbox 360 right now.
2370360	2371360	Yay.
2371360	2372960	Actually, I think that's only the first half of the game.
2372960	2375880	I think it's going to be two halves, they're about 1,200 points each.
2375880	2378000	Well, then there you have it.
2378000	2383480	But if you don't like that, you can spend an extra 10 bucks and buy the disc.
2383480	2386560	So what's Lara Croft's equivalent of horse armor?
2386560	2391440	Or better yet, just wait a few months because this game isn't that great to begin with and
2391440	2394280	wait for the drop in price.
2394280	2395880	Does download content drop in price that much?
2395880	2396880	I guess so.
2396880	2397880	No, I'm talking about buying...
2397880	2398880	I bought Carcassonne and then it was free like four months later.
2398880	2402720	I'm talking about buying the disc version of the game.
2402720	2404320	Oh, I gotcha.
2404320	2411000	Anyways, speaking of Xbox Live stuff, if you live in Europe, they're going to be offering
2411000	2417720	you instead of Halo 3 for buying an Xbox 360, 10 free Xbox Live arcade games for new European
2417720	2421760	Xbox 360 owners and a friend.
2421760	2422760	Let's see here.
2422760	2431320	Now, what you can do, if you buy a console between October 1st and December 14th, you
2431320	2437240	can fill out a form and then both you and a friend can get 10 free Xbox Live arcade
2437240	2441320	games, which, to be honest, aren't that bad.
2441320	2447440	It's a pretty good selection, including Every Extend Extra Extreme, Sonic the Hedgehog,
2447440	2453400	Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting, Bomberman Live, Marble Blast Ultra, Spy Glass Board
2453400	2460600	Games, Small Arms, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures, Assault Heroes, and Zuma Deluxe.
2460600	2461600	Hey, it's free.
2461600	2462600	It's not bad.
2462600	2463600	That's not bad at all.
2463600	2465680	We don't have anything comparable like here in the U.S.
2465680	2469320	Well, maybe like the arcade bundle has the five games with it.
2469320	2471960	Yeah, but a little different.
2471960	2472960	Interesting.
2472960	2475560	Well, lucky those folks over in Europe.
2475560	2479080	Also, let's get into some release dates and talk about Europe first.
2479080	2482760	Jamie's not here, but I've got you covered on what is coming out in Europe.
2482760	2487420	I imagine now that the holidays are over, things are slowing down in terms of release
2487420	2489040	dates, but apparently not.
2489040	2492320	There's still a lot of stuff coming out on the 30th over in Europe.
2492320	2500060	We have a port of Alvin and the Chipmunks, which is a translation of that Oscar award-winning
2500060	2501060	movie that's coming out.
2501060	2502060	It's a music game.
2502060	2503060	Is it a music game for real?
2503060	2507240	It's not karaoke though, but it's a rhythm music game.
2507240	2512840	There's rhythm music games that are good, like DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, then there's
2512840	2513840	these types of music games.
2513840	2514840	This isn't going to be one of them.
2514840	2515840	Yeah, exactly.
2515840	2519200	Alvin and Chipmunks comes out on the 30th on the DS and the Wii.
2519200	2524080	BlackSight Area 51 makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360, also on the 30th.
2524080	2527920	Boogie finally makes its way to Europe on PlayStation 2 and the DS this week.
2527920	2530720	Cruisin comes out on the Wii, I'm sure you can skip that.
2530720	2535960	Football Manager for the PSP comes out, as well as Guitar Hero 3 comes out on the PC
2535960	2536960	this week.
2536960	2541400	I believe it already came out on the consoles last week, because I've seen, yeah, it must
2541400	2545800	come out last week, because I saw some British folks joining the OL Army.
2545800	2548240	Genga comes out on the DS on the 30th.
2548240	2551920	Medal of Honor for the PSP also comes out on the 30th.
2551920	2555360	Pro Evo Soccer 2008 for the PSP also on the 30th.
2555360	2559760	Puzzle Quest comes out on the PlayStation 2, Resident Evil the Umbrella Chronicles on
2559760	2566240	the Wii, Speedball 2 on the PC, Siphon Filter on the PSP, The Golden Compass on Damn Near
2566240	2571600	Every System, again another kind of gaming port of a movie, and lastly, but certainly
2571600	2579440	not leastly, My Horse and Me on the PC, developed by Atari, and you wonder why their CEO recently
2579440	2581440	left the company.
2581440	2586360	Anyways, for the US there's really not a whole lot coming out this week.
2586360	2592360	On the DS, I don't know why they're releasing this game, but Master of Illusion, it's a
2592360	2597440	magic trick training sim or something like that.
2597440	2601960	It teaches you how to do card tricks, and you do magic with your DS.
2601960	2602960	Who's gonna be...
2602960	2605720	Oh my god, and it's fucking full-priced?
2605720	2606720	That's got to be different.
2606720	2608640	We just stole $34 out of your wallet.
2608640	2609640	That's magic!
2609640	2610640	That's a...
2610640	2613040	Well, if you're buying it from GameStop, it's full-priced, but it's not...
2613040	2614040	Two words.
2614040	2615040	It's supposed to be $20.
2615040	2616040	Two words.
2616040	2617440	Ping Pals.
2617440	2624760	Cranium Kabuki, if you like that trivia game, normally a board game, you can buy that from
2624760	2631280	Ubisoft on the Wii, Boogie is coming out on the DS this week, also Geometry Wars Galaxies
2631280	2642440	on the DS, History Channel Battle for the Pacific on the Wii, and indoor sports from
2642440	2646720	Konami, although that's not coming out, that's next year.
2646720	2656320	Well, they list it as, because we have some more current dates than they do, that's it.
2656320	2657320	It's really...
2657320	2661200	I imagine it's probably a much slower week here, thanks to Black Friday being over.
2661200	2665680	Did they actually venture out on Black Friday, out of curiosity?
2665680	2668120	I did later on in the evening.
2668120	2673640	I went to GameStop around 2 to pick up the Wings of the Goddess, and it wasn't that bad.
2673640	2675920	They were adequately staffed, I'll tell you that.
2675920	2677600	They had people walking the floor and everything.
2677600	2683480	I went and bought Zola, and the Zapper, you know what's weird though?
2683480	2688600	The Zapper, from what we've, you know, the press release said it was supposed to be $20,
2688600	2696560	and my company, we're selling it, it's $20 retail, GameStop is selling it for $25.
2696560	2698080	Oh ho ho ho!
2698080	2699080	Everywhere.
2699080	2700080	Interesting.
2700080	2701080	Chop around for the best deal?
2701080	2704240	No, I spent $25 because I'm lazy.
2704240	2708720	I don't know, it's wasted $25 right there, but yeah, we'll get into that later.
2708720	2710920	Alright, let's get into some Japanese release dates.
2710920	2718680	Assassin's Creed comes out in Japan, the localized version for the Xbox 360 from Ubisoft.
2718680	2723120	Apocalypse Desire Next is a new game on the Xbox 360.
2723120	2727440	It is a strategy-based game, and it doesn't look like anything we have over here.
2727440	2729920	Just trying to take a look at some screenshots real quick.
2729920	2734760	Looks like it might be a tactical type of game.
2734760	2735760	Trying to look here.
2735760	2739520	Oh yes, definitely more of a tactical-based type of game, so check that out.
2739520	2743640	If you like those games, Apocalypse Desire Next, also coming out this week in Japan.
2743640	2750080	On the Wii, Swing Golf, Pangea Second Shot is coming out, which I'm sure is just kind
2750080	2753960	of Nintendo's version of Hot Shots Golf, or Who We Trying to Kid is just another rip-off
2753960	2755860	of a Wii Sports title.
2755860	2762820	Also coming out on the Wii, Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes on the Wii, coming out from Capcom.
2762820	2768080	Also coming out in Japan, Tony Hawk's Project 8 on the PlayStation 3.
2768080	2773400	Star Train Your Past Makes Your Future on the PlayStation 2 from Princess Soft.
2773400	2778440	Yep, you can get a limited edition of that game as well if you follow every Princess
2778440	2779680	Soft title.
2779680	2786360	Speaking of Princesses on the Nintendo DS, Disney Princesses Magical Jewels comes out
2786360	2788840	in Japan.
2788840	2791960	I don't know exactly what their magical jewels are, but I don't want to find out.
2791960	2797600	Cats 2 comes out of the Nintendo DS in Japan, another cat simulation game, because apparently
2797600	2803920	Cats 1 with a Z, that's Cats with a Z, was so popular there is now a Cats 2.
2803920	2810800	Fuku Mori, Mori No Unhappy Project is coming out from Bandai also on the Nintendo DS, and
2810800	2812860	I have no idea what this game is all about.
2812860	2818160	Looks like it could be another mix of mini-games, it's hard to tell from the screenshots, it's
2818160	2821520	an action-based game, probably a typical platformer.
2821520	2822520	What's so damn funny?
2822520	2823520	Is it chat?
2823520	2824520	It's chat.
2824520	2826080	What are they saying in chat, Drew?
2826080	2828000	Oh, typical DMN.
2828000	2830480	Princess Soft, doesn't Rob work for them?
2830480	2832760	Hahaha, funny.
2832760	2838560	Coming on the PSP, Disgaea Hour of Darkness Portable coming out, the portable version
2838560	2843160	of the popular strategy game, that's going to do it for Japanese release dates.
2843160	2844160	Awesome.
2844160	2849840	Anyways, one thing that's supposedly coming soon to the Wii, which is weird because I
2849840	2855160	never thought I would, but the Unreal 3 engine is apparently being adapted for the Wii by
2855160	2857560	some unnamed company.
2857560	2861880	They're porting it over much like I guess they did with the Unreal 2 engine.
2861880	2867480	Oh, Ubisoft ported over the Unreal 2 engine for Red Steel.
2867480	2871280	So is it coming over for Red Steel 2, maybe?
2871280	2872280	I don't know.
2872280	2875560	Because isn't the rumors that that game is supposed to be made?
2875560	2876560	It is.
2876560	2877560	Hopefully it doesn't suck as much as the first one.
2877560	2880760	Yeah, maybe they can make it right this time.
2880760	2881760	I don't know.
2881760	2890040	You know, you've heard my opinion on Ubisoft ports for Wii.
2890040	2891400	I tried to stay away from them.
2891400	2893000	But we don't know for sure it's them.
2893000	2896060	It's an unnamed company that's doing it, but it's just kind of one of those, you know,
2896060	2899040	if you were betting, odds would favor this.
2899040	2903440	I think they could probably do it if they did something like cel-shaded or something
2903440	2907640	like that, very simple like Wind Waker type graphics, where you simplify and you'll have
2907640	2911280	all these textures and stuff you have to worry about, you could probably pump some interesting
2911280	2913200	stuff out on the Unreal engine.
2913200	2917060	Xenocore in chat says, why adapt Unreal Tournament 3 for the Wii?
2917060	2918060	What the fuck?
2918060	2921600	I'm obviously speaking about the engine in general, not the game.
2921600	2923560	Again, it's money.
2923560	2928280	If a company can port their game to multiple systems this way, they'll do it.
2928280	2933520	And if they can successfully port Unreal Engine over for the Wii, then they can sell that
2933520	2938280	to other companies, you know, to make Wii versions of stuff using the Unreal 3 engine.
2938280	2941480	And plus, you know, with just the Wii selling as crazy as it is, you know, if you've probably
2941480	2947120	seen the stories on Black Friday, people are still going crazy about the Nintendo Wii,
2947120	2949400	and it's, you know, it's kind of a different demographic.
2949400	2953300	You know, the more family household, quote unquote, is where the Nintendo Wiis are going.
2953300	2956920	So certainly if there is a particular game that they want to try and get a piece of that
2956920	2962720	audience with that type of, you know, share of the marketplace, they'll go for it.
2962720	2968960	Anyhow, let's take this opportunity to dive into the mailbag and take a look at some of
2968960	2971320	the emails that we've gotten this week.
2971320	2974320	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbagorangelaunchradio.com.
2974320	2979480	Mark Sakura will usually take on these responsibilities, but since she's not here, I stole the password
2979480	2986800	to the mailbag and I'm looking in her place.
2986800	2991160	Let's look at email number one tonight of four emails we're reading tonight.
2991160	2996280	Email number one comes to us from Arvid, who didn't use a handle, so I called him by his
2996280	2997280	real name.
2997280	2999480	And Arvid says, greetings, just a quick question.
2999480	3003560	What is the song called that you play at the end of the show, and from what game is it?
3003560	3005760	Sorry if this has already been answered in the forums.
3005760	3010280	The song at the end of the program that you will hear in a little while when we finish
3010280	3023960	is iFutureList by Kiriyama Oka, which I believe appeared in DDR Supernova in the US for a
3023960	3024960	console game.
3024960	3027200	I thought it was Xtreme 2 also.
3027200	3028200	Was it in Xtreme 2?
3028200	3029840	I thought it was Supernova.
3029840	3032460	And I'm sure one of the Bahmani nerds in the chat knows for sure, but it made its first
3032460	3034440	appearance in one of the 2DX games.
3034440	3039400	I want to say 2DX 13th?
3039400	3040400	I don't remember.
3040400	3041400	It's been a long time.
3041400	3042400	I stopped tracking after 8th.
3042400	3045540	And it shows up in various Bahmani games.
3045540	3052480	Let's go to the next email coming to us from Chard, also known as Rick the UK fanboy.
3052480	3054720	Hey guys, do you have a postage address?
3054720	3058360	We're going through a mass tidy at our house and I have to throw out a lot of my stuff.
3058360	3060640	I've come across some things that might be fun to send you.
3060640	3062360	A Christmas present maybe.
3062360	3064840	Oh, I like presents.
3064840	3070240	As long as it's not a B-O-M-B, then I guess I'm okay with giving out the address.
3070240	3071240	So we'll see.
3071240	3075560	Yeah, sure, I'll reply to that and find out, but there's another part of this.
3075560	3077120	I wouldn't have read this on air if that was it.
3077120	3078120	There is another part of this.
3078120	3080080	Anyway, I also have a question.
3080080	3084840	Which game were you so excited to get and when it came out was the biggest disappointment?
3084840	3088760	If you could go back in time and hit the developer over the head with a big comedy inflatable
3088760	3091480	hammer, what would you get them to change?
3091480	3096080	Cheerio, governor, chimney, cup of tea, telly, and all that stuff.
3096080	3100920	Well, he is our UK fanboy, so you forgot crumpets.
3100920	3101920	You forgot crumpets.
3101920	3106680	Hope you had a good turkey day or whatever the devil it is you Americans celebrate.
3106680	3107680	This is Thanksgiving.
3107680	3109240	I don't know.
3109240	3112840	A game that came out and you were extremely disappointed in it.
3112840	3113840	Actually I can...
3113840	3114840	It's easy.
3114840	3115840	I know right off the top of my head what it is.
3115840	3117720	I can think of one right now.
3117720	3119720	Red Seal.
3119720	3127440	You know, it was really hyped up, it was supposed to be really awesome, and really was not awesome.
3127440	3129000	It was controlled by poop.
3129000	3131560	It was one of those things that sounded great on paper, huh?
3131560	3132560	It did.
3132560	3133560	Yes.
3133560	3135000	And I don't know, it was just exciting.
3135000	3139760	The whole concept of, you know, people call you on your phone in the game and you pick
3139760	3142400	it up, you know, your remote like a phone.
3142400	3148480	Apparently though, your phone has really shitty sound on it because, you know, those controllers.
3148480	3149880	Very good.
3149880	3150880	Drew?
3150880	3151880	I have two.
3151880	3152880	Okay.
3152880	3156480	Guilty Gear Dust Strikers, the DS game.
3156480	3162280	And the second almost everyone can agree with, the Matrix Path of Neo.
3162280	3164680	It had such promise too.
3164680	3169360	And then they went and screwed it up just like they did Enter the Matrix.
3169360	3170360	Which one was the Matrix Path of Neo?
3170360	3171360	I don't remember that one.
3171360	3172360	I remember Enter the Matrix.
3172360	3173360	It came out a couple years ago.
3173360	3177080	It came out a couple years ago where you actually played as Neo, which is what all the Matrix
3177080	3179920	fans wanted, you know, to play as Neo.
3179920	3185520	But they screwed up the fighting system, they screwed up the plot, and they made a joke
3185520	3187080	of a last boss.
3187080	3189920	Easy, easy, easy for me.
3189920	3192600	The game that was the biggest disappointment where I wanted to go back and smack the developers
3192600	3193600	upside the head.
3193600	3195040	And then 10 Dogs.
3195040	3196040	Remember E3?
3196040	3197200	I freaking fell in love with this game.
3197200	3199400	I said it's going to be the greatest game that comes out this year and then when the
3199400	3201760	game comes out I was bored with it in an hour.
3201760	3202760	Woof.
3202760	3207000	I know because there was nothing really else to do besides those three contests.
3207000	3211760	There wasn't a lot of, like, competitive stuff and there wasn't much you could do with the
3211760	3212760	dogs.
3212760	3216280	Yes, I realized it was supposed to be a sim, but I don't know.
3216280	3219520	I was thinking there would be more of a game to it and there wasn't and that was kind of
3219520	3220520	sad.
3220520	3221520	How about We Connect 24?
3221520	3223720	Does that count as a game?
3223720	3224720	Kind of.
3224720	3227240	Animal Crossing DS would be a close second for me, honestly.
3227240	3232040	Because I was expecting so much more from that and I think it felt more like a port
3232040	3235360	than a sequel and that was what was ultimately disappointing.
3235360	3236360	So there you have it.
3236360	3240720	And the other disappointing thing about Nintendogs is the fact that it's been selling like crazy
3240720	3244840	and now we have all of these knockoff games to thank, such as, like, Cats 2, which I think
3244840	3245840	we said earlier.
3245840	3247640	Imagine Babies, all those stuff.
3247640	3256280	Did you see they had, what was it, a bundle, I think, through, honestly, maybe, it was
3256280	3258240	like one of the big retail chains.
3258240	3265660	But it was the Nintendogs, like that metallic red or rose DS, and then two or three other
3265660	3266660	versions of Nintendogs.
3266660	3269640	You get, like, four of the same game.
3269640	3270640	Nice.
3270640	3272560	Very nice.
3272560	3276120	Diemen Nourishment said it was designed to be played like 15 minutes a day, Rob.
3276120	3277120	What do you want?
3277120	3278120	Yeah!
3278120	3279120	And then it got boring after two days.
3279120	3280620	I mean, that was the problem.
3280620	3282240	There was not a lot to come back for.
3282240	3284720	There wasn't a lot to kind of, like, earn or work towards in that game.
3284720	3285720	It's a frickin' Tamagotchi.
3285720	3286720	Kinda.
3286720	3287720	I don't know.
3287720	3290680	It just, I was expecting so much more based on what I saw at E3.
3290680	3293000	I was so excited and I was just so disappointed.
3293000	3294800	Transformers The Game.
3294800	3295800	Yeah.
3295800	3298000	That would be one I was extremely disappointed in.
3298000	3299720	All right, let's move on.
3299720	3302800	Here's a story tip from our old buddy, RobWithTwoBees.
3302800	3305960	Here is a link to a boy killing an old woman for money.
3305960	3309480	He just happened to admit that it was to pay for an MMORPG time.
3309480	3313480	I don't see how this is actually related to games, but that's how it is spun.
3313480	3316380	If you ask me, the violent act was done solely for money.
3316380	3321040	The fact that it was for four pounds sterling doesn't make it more tragic because the kid
3321040	3323000	didn't know how much she had.
3323000	3327920	So in other words, he's sending us a link to the story about how, you know, let's see,
3327920	3330200	boy murders old woman for game money.
3330200	3332440	Oh, and this is a story that was Doug and everything.
3332440	3337520	It was a 13-year-old kid in Vietnam robbed an 81-year-old woman and he used the money
3337520	3339200	to play online games.
3339200	3340560	I see.
3340560	3343880	And obviously where Rob's kinda going is that, isn't this really about a robbery?
3343880	3345240	Why does it necessarily have to be about games?
3345240	3346740	Who cares what they spin it on?
3346740	3348480	It wasn't me, I swear.
3348480	3351480	I mean, it's like, if he spin it on crack, it wouldn't have made the news.
3351480	3356760	You know, it's sad that that woman got robbed, but we really want to know, what did he spend
3356760	3357760	the money on?
3357760	3360160	Let's get in the mind of this criminal.
3360160	3361440	How did he spend that money?
3361440	3366040	And then, let's prove that gamers are completely worthless moral rejects.
3366040	3371760	I love this too, is that the story makes reference to the story from earlier this month when
3371760	3376380	that kid beat up his mom over Halo 3 when she tried to take it away from him, like call
3376380	3380200	the cops, that whole thing we read on a previous show.
3380200	3381680	They remind folks of that.
3381680	3384480	Yeah, let's just call it bad parenting and leave it at that.
3384480	3388420	That's your Jamie angle, I imagine.
3388420	3391560	Thank you, you do a very good job for filling in for Jamie when she's not here.
3391560	3392560	I appreciate that.
3392560	3396140	All right, we got one more email for you guys this week, and then if you want to contribute
3396140	3398960	an email in the future, it's mailbag at orangelaunchrader.com.
3398960	3404420	Our last email tonight comes from Rissimo, and Rissimo asks, hey guys, I love the show,
3404420	3406280	and I always make sure to tell my friends about it.
3406280	3407280	Thank you.
3407280	3409440	I recall Loki saying that he had Ratchet and Clank.
3409440	3411640	He hasn't said anything else about the game in a while.
3411640	3417640	I love the game and was wondering if it's even been in his PS3 yet.
3417640	3422160	My PS3 is being borrowed by a friend who likes Ratchet and Clank a lot more than I do.
3422160	3423160	Nice.
3423160	3425560	And he's playing it, and he loves the game.
3425560	3429800	So that's a no, but to be honest, I don't even think I want to play the game.
3429800	3430800	It looks fun.
3430800	3431800	It looks like Ratchet and Clank.
3431800	3432800	Then why'd you buy it?
3432800	3437400	Because I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order, and I just said fuck it, I'm going to pick
3437400	3439400	it up because it's supposed to be a good game.
3439400	3440960	New tool.
3440960	3441960	It looks good.
3441960	3446800	It looks fun, but you know, it's just, I didn't play any of the Ratchet and Clank games, and
3446800	3450160	there's probably a reason for that, because I didn't want to play them, and why the fuck
3450160	3451160	did I buy the new one?
3451160	3455360	I know, because I'm desperate for good games for the PS3.
3455360	3456920	And which you don't play.
3456920	3461160	Well, now I'm loaned it to a friend right now because he's going to get his own PS3
3461160	3465440	soon, and probably when he does that, I'm probably going to sell him the game, so.
3465440	3467920	Rama says, damn, Loki, you're sad.
3467920	3472120	And Artitsuya says, Loki, do you think Mario Galaxy ripped them off as they claim?
3472120	3473120	No.
3473120	3474120	Alright.
3474120	3476040	More of the email from Marisimo here.
3476040	3481120	Also if you guys tried Super Stardust HD or any other PSN titles, I think that even though
3481120	3484680	the selection is pretty slim, most of the games are worth trying, especially if you've
3484680	3486360	got a Japanese account.
3486360	3489080	GTProlog looks fucking amazing.
3489080	3492680	Thanks for consistently putting on such great shows, we appreciate it.
3492680	3493680	Thank you.
3493680	3497880	I do have a Japanese account, and I do play GTProlog, and I still don't like Gran Turismo,
3497880	3502320	no matter how pretty they make it, but that's just my personal preference.
3502320	3503320	It looks pretty.
3503320	3508540	I wouldn't say it's any better than Project Anthem Racing 3.
3508540	3513200	I don't know, it's just, it's, when the, get the cars looking that good, it really, at
3513200	3517280	this point, it's not like leaps and bounds better than anything that's out there right
3517280	3518280	now.
3518280	3519440	So, you know, whatever.
3519440	3521000	I do have Flow.
3521000	3522000	Flow's fun.
3522000	3525840	I, personally, the only thing that's really stopping me from buying games on the Playstation
3525840	3530640	Network is I hate their fucking account system, where you have to put money on this account
3530640	3535080	or whatever, and then you download games with that, and you end up with this like five cent
3535080	3540080	remainders and shit on there, because everything's like, you know, this 99 or whatever, instead
3540080	3544040	of rounding them out, it's like, you know, Xbox Live Marketplace.
3544040	3549280	So I just, even with Xbox Live Marketplace, so you get a little bit of that, where like
3549280	3551320	you always have some points left over, you know?
3551320	3555160	Yeah, but at least there's stuff I can download on there, I mean, and also a lot of the download
3555160	3562160	stuff that they have on the Playstation Network is a little bit more expensive, or like less
3562160	3563840	production value or whatever.
3563840	3569240	I know there's good stuff on there, like Everyday Shooter and some of the stuff like that, but
3569240	3571680	there's nothing really that's jumped out at me, other than Flow.
3571680	3573840	Flow's kind of fun, but I don't know.
3573840	3574840	Alright.
3574840	3579160	Alright, well that's it for the mailbag, so again, if you want to email us sometime, mailbag
3579160	3580560	at orangelaungeradio.com.
3580560	3587200	Alright, anyways, on to some other stuff.
3587200	3591760	Of course, it's no surprise that Super Mario Galaxy is selling well.
3591760	3601360	It has sold 500,000 copies in the US in the first week alone, which is pretty awesome,
3601360	3606000	and of course it's probably going to be continuing to sell well all throughout the holidays.
3606000	3612320	We also know that it sold 250,000 units in Japan in its first week as well, so definitely
3612320	3617120	one of the more popular games for the Wii out there, but I think it's no surprise that
3617120	3618560	it's selling that well.
3618560	3622040	Although not millions and millions of copies, though, kind of like Halo 3.
3622040	3624360	Yeah, but wait for the Christmas season to be over.
3624360	3625360	True.
3625360	3627880	And this is also a game that people are going to constantly buy going forward.
3627880	3632640	Halo 3, I don't know, it just kind of teetered off, like really quick, I think.
3632640	3638040	Well, I mean, it had a huge launch, and everybody that had Halo 2, it's kind of like earlier
3638040	3640240	in the show, it's like about the whole MMO thing.
3640240	3644520	In a way, it's kind of similar with hardcore fans of a series.
3644520	3646360	Everybody's going to be out there day one buying it.
3646360	3650120	Can you imagine if Halo 3's multiplayer servers have gone down going, oh, sorry, we didn't
3650120	3653680	think so many people would try to get on, which is basically what Squeenix did with
3653680	3654680	Final Fantasy.
3654680	3657560	Well, the difference is there's a single player element to Halo.
3657560	3659960	I guess that's true.
3659960	3664920	All right, well, anyhow, you can play single player in Final Fantasy XI.
3664920	3666640	That's fine.
3666640	3671120	There's a new device out there called the Cyber Familator.
3671120	3674680	It allows you to play your Famicom games on your DS Lite.
3674680	3677400	Also with this device, you can use a TV Out.
3677400	3681760	Now, keep in mind that is a Famicom emulator, and it's not actually an emulator, it's
3681760	3682760	an actual device.
3682760	3686560	You put your DS on top of it, and it does this whole thing, so keep in mind it's
3686560	3692440	not, it's Japanese, so you can't use it for NES games.
3692440	3696680	But just out of curiosity, is this something you guys would want?
3696680	3700320	Would you want it like it is now to play Japanese imports, or do you think it might be kind
3700320	3704080	of cool to have something to use your old school NES cartridges on?
3704080	3705320	It looks kind of cool.
3705320	3707880	Looks like almost the DS version of the Super 8.
3707880	3710640	I'd get it just for nostalgia's sake.
3710640	3713840	I wish there was more you could do with it, kind of like with the Super Game Boy and stuff,
3713840	3715680	like you could change the colors and all that dumb shit.
3715680	3720480	It would be cool if you could like, I don't know, hack the NES games and change the sprites
3720480	3721760	like you can on the PC.
3721760	3726000	Honestly, if I were just going to buy something like that extra from my DS, I'd just buy
3726000	3729760	one of those cards to load ROMs on there and just play it off that.
3729760	3732500	It would probably be a lot cheaper anyways.
3732500	3736240	This person who I believe is DMN under one of his many nicknames will warn you though,
3736240	3737880	it will fuck your warranty, FYI.
3737880	3741440	That's a good point, if you're going to get something like this and install a game
3741440	3742440	that still has warranties.
3742440	3743640	Why would it fuck your warranty?
3743640	3745800	I think it's something you have to attach there.
3745800	3749620	No, it just plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot.
3749620	3752200	That's why it's only on one screen, because it's plugging into the Game Boy Advance slot.
3752200	3755000	You probably can fucking use it on a Game Boy Advance.
3755000	3756000	But you know.
3756000	3757560	Oh, it's for the DS, I'm sorry.
3757560	3758560	Interesting.
3758560	3764600	But yeah, it's not like something you have to mod your system for, that'd be stupid.
3764600	3766680	Anyways, let's see here.
3766680	3771280	There's actually been a series that just started on TV, and I've got to mention this.
3771280	3774760	The Discovery Channel's Rise of the Video Game, it's actually pretty good.
3774760	3779320	I watched the first episode of it, it reminds me if you've ever watched G4's Icon series
3779320	3780560	that they have.
3780560	3785400	Very similar to that kind of thing, but it's kind of the whole history of video games,
3785400	3791880	and they just started with the very first computer game to the 70s, like Pac-Man, and
3791880	3793880	stuff like that.
3793880	3798520	Yeah, exactly, and a really fascinating series, I mean, they're going to replay the hell out
3798520	3803360	of this all throughout the week, so I recommend catching it on TV, or YouTube.
3803360	3808280	DMN would like to remind you that any third party thingamajig.license fucks your warranty,
3808280	3809280	apparently.
3809280	3810280	Oh.
3810280	3811280	Oh.
3811280	3815120	You mean I avoided my warranty by using the Game Genie on my NES?
3815120	3817840	How would they prove that you fucked it up by plugging it in there?
3817840	3822400	If there's no physical evidence, they're not going to be like, hmm, I sense residue from
3822400	3823400	this thing.
3823400	3825480	I mean, they're not fucking CSI.
3825480	3826480	There's a lot of dust on this.
3826480	3829760	My DS broke, you know, fix it, and they're just going to do it.
3829760	3833000	They're not going to be able to tell unless you actually broke it open.
3833000	3834000	You'll never know.
3834000	3835000	I'm not CSI.
3835000	3837000	They don't have the snappy one-liners.
3837000	3840080	All right.
3840080	3841080	Let's go.
3841080	3845080	Wait, I actually want to ask real quick about the rise of the video game.
3845080	3846320	Is that something you actually watched?
3846320	3847320	Yeah, I did.
3847320	3848320	It was good.
3848320	3850200	What was the format of it?
3850200	3851880	Because I forgot to TiVo it.
3851880	3855280	It's basically a reminder, like I said, of the Icon series.
3855280	3859720	They kind of discussed different things that went on, and then they would have developers
3859720	3864240	and major key figures and stuff commenting on it.
3864240	3866640	They had the president of IGN.
3866640	3872560	They had some of the first, the creator of Pac-Man and stuff, and they were talking about
3872560	3878480	just all the phenomenon, the pop culture stuff related with video games, and just the mentality
3878480	3879480	and all that stuff.
3879480	3881720	They went and talked about Tetris.
3881720	3884340	It just is very well done.
3884340	3887200	It's a really cool series.
3887200	3889480	I think it's worth checking out.
3889480	3893720	The last documentary I watched on games was that PBS one that was in high def.
3893720	3894720	It was kind of neat.
3894720	3897760	I mean, this, like I said, I love the Icon series.
3897760	3905120	That was probably my favorite show on G4, but now they do it about everything.
3905120	3906920	It's no longer good.
3906920	3911800	Well, speaking of paying tribute to the elders, this is the part of the show, because we are
3911800	3913040	getting towards the end of the show.
3913040	3917120	We are going to get into the Skype line soon, but first we want to cover this week's classic
3917120	3918120	game of the week.
3918120	3923840	Now, Dark Soccer is not here this week, so I've taken it upon myself to select a classic
3923840	3925040	game of the week.
3925040	3926760	I believe Loki will do one for next week.
3926760	3927760	Okay.
3927760	3928760	You better.
3928760	3929760	All right.
3929760	3930760	Here is this week's classic game of the week.
3930760	3931760	Oops, wrong music.
3931760	3946360	All right, this week's classic game of the week is a game called Equinox is the classic
3946360	3947360	game of the week.
3947360	3954320	Equinox was actually the sequel to another game on the NES called Solstice 2.
3954320	3956120	Solstice was the game on NES.
3956120	3959520	This was kind of Solstice 2 in many ways.
3959520	3965000	Part of the reason I totally dig this game is the fact that it was kind of like...
3965000	3967520	I love the ambiance and the music in this game.
3967520	3969280	It really set the mood.
3969280	3973960	Basically, you have this kind of isometric view of the game.
3973960	3977920	If you ever played Solstice on the NES, it was kind of very similar.
3977920	3983200	You had this isometric view of the game, and you were going through these dungeons and
3983200	3987680	kind of trying to solve all these different puzzles in the game.
3987680	3990820	The ambiance that the music set was just awesome.
3990820	3994700	You got these different items, and you had to fight the bosses, and they had really cool
3994700	3996760	boss music in the game.
3996760	4001480	I think, ironically, one of the things that was really cool about Equinox was that it
4001480	4004120	was actually developed by Sony.
4004120	4007800	One of the Sony spin-offs companies, Sony ImagineSoft, was actually the company that
4007800	4008800	made this game.
4008800	4013560	It was kind of like Sony making a game for the Super Nintendo, which is kind of cool.
4013560	4018280	Of course, obviously, Sony ImagineSoft was phased out a little while later, and they
4018280	4020720	went on to make games for the PlayStation.
4020720	4025200	If you enjoyed Solstice on the NES, you may not even know this game existed, so it's my
4025200	4026960	pick for the game of the week is Equinox.
4026960	4028640	Did you guys ever play this game?
4028640	4029640	Lowkey?
4029640	4030640	Nope.
4030640	4031640	Yeah.
4031640	4033040	It required a hell of a lot of patience.
4033040	4036120	It had kind of a steep learning curve, but it was a little fun once you got used to it.
4036120	4037120	It did.
4037120	4040240	It had a real steep learning curve to it, and it was fucking hard.
4040240	4043520	The other thing about it is that it had a really precise way to kind of get through
4043520	4047960	the game, and it was not very forgiving in regards to running into people and stuff.
4047960	4053040	I don't know if it's maybe the YouTube guy playing it on an emulator or something, but
4053040	4054960	why the fuck is all the text in front of...
4054960	4055960	Because it's a demo.
4055960	4056960	You're looking at a demo.
4056960	4057960	Oh.
4057960	4058960	So.
4058960	4060840	You pop up on the overworld, and within two minutes you're dead.
4060840	4061840	Yeah, it's tough.
4061840	4062840	It's tough.
4062840	4063840	Yeah, there were little bosses around the overworld.
4063840	4066160	You know this game was actually originally developed to be an RPG.
4066160	4072920	If you actually look on YouTube, you can find YouTube clips of this game as an RPG.
4072920	4075960	You can actually see text that was cut from the game.
4075960	4078320	So kind of interesting the way it's set up.
4078320	4080200	So there you have it.
4080200	4085840	Being asked in chat room, DMN under the guise, your mom, says, Rob, will this be on virtual
4085840	4086840	console?
4086840	4089200	And I say, Lordy, I hope so.
4089200	4090360	I hope so.
4090360	4093400	So Loki, you'll be bringing a classic game next week in Jamie's Absence, correct?
4093400	4094400	Yeah.
4094400	4095400	All right.
4095400	4096400	All right.
4096400	4097400	This is the part of the show then.
4097400	4098400	It is a short show tonight.
4098400	4101120	We want to cram it all into one segment, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype
4101120	4102120	lines.
4102120	4109180	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
4109180	4110720	And folks have been hammering the phones already.
4110720	4113440	I believe we already have a call on the line.
4113440	4114440	Call are you there?
4114440	4115440	Hi, Rob.
4115440	4116440	Hi.
4116440	4117440	Is this Jamie?
4117440	4118440	Yes, it is.
4118440	4119440	Hi, Jamie.
4119440	4120440	How are you?
4120440	4123780	I'm looking at the rain right now.
4123780	4125400	Is it raining where you're at?
4125400	4127040	Oh, yeah, it's raining.
4127040	4128040	Of course.
4128040	4129040	So I'm sure...
4129040	4130040	I am...
4130040	4131040	I'm sorry.
4131040	4132040	I know you're...
4132040	4133040	I'm...
4133040	4134040	Oh, go ahead.
4134040	4135040	I'm just saying I'm calling from Alabama.
4135040	4136040	Well, how has things been going out there?
4136040	4137040	How was your Thanksgiving?
4137040	4141560	We had it yesterday, and the mom cooked for a small army, but thankfully a small army
4141560	4143960	showed up, and then they went off to kick butt for me.
4143960	4144960	Nice.
4144960	4147240	And it was pretty cool.
4147240	4149400	And we've just been doing a lot of hanging out.
4149400	4155760	I haven't gotten much played, but I did watch a movie that a lot of people on the Half-Life
4155760	4160000	and Portal boards were saying that they thought Portal might have been based off of.
4160000	4164160	I had mentioned to you earlier it was Cube.
4164160	4166040	Oh, the movie Cube.
4166040	4168360	Yeah, that movie's cool.
4168360	4169360	I love that movie.
4169360	4170360	I saw it a long time ago.
4170360	4173440	But there are some real bastardized sequels to the movie, from what I understand.
4173440	4177200	I haven't seen them, so I guess I should withhold my final opinion until I see them, but I've
4177200	4178360	heard the sequels are not good.
4178360	4179960	Hypercube is a mindfuck.
4179960	4181480	Hypercube and Cube Zero.
4181480	4182480	Yes.
4182480	4184480	I'm supposed to be watching while I'm here.
4184480	4185480	Oh, nice.
4185480	4186480	Very nice.
4186480	4187480	Have you gotten any gaming done while you've been out there?
4187480	4188480	Not really.
4188480	4189880	I haven't had much of a chance to.
4189880	4195840	I did bring my Game Boy with me, and actually on the plane, I tried to play Olendan, because
4195840	4196840	I've got puppies.
4196840	4197840	Copy.
4197840	4198840	Nice.
4198840	4199840	Olendan's a fun game play.
4199840	4200840	Not much else.
4200840	4206560	I almost logged into Ragnarok once at this Wi-Fi place that we found.
4206560	4207560	Very cool.
4207560	4208560	It was pending.
4208560	4209560	No, it didn't.
4209560	4210560	I resisted the urge.
4210560	4213920	If I sounded a little distracted during the Classic Game of the Week segment, that's because
4213920	4217920	I was actually trying to pick up Jamie's call, but I was curious, did you hear the Classic
4217920	4218920	Game of the Week segment?
4218920	4220480	Did I pick a worthy game this week?
4220480	4222520	Did you say you picked Psychonauts?
4222520	4228400	No, it was Equinox, which was Solstice II on the Super Nintendo, basically.
4228400	4231960	I was like, that wasn't on Super Nintendo.
4231960	4234360	No, no, Equinox.
4234360	4235360	No.
4235360	4236360	How?
4236360	4239760	Equinox, which was much, well, I like Psychonauts, too.
4239760	4243440	I can't say it's much cooler, but it was a very cool game.
4243440	4246760	I was just curious if I picked a worthy game this week.
4246760	4248160	I'd say you did.
4248160	4250440	That's a pretty good one.
4250440	4251440	Awesome.
4251440	4252440	The other thing-
4252440	4253440	Get my Samsung approval.
4253440	4254440	Good.
4254440	4255440	Good.
4255440	4256440	I'm always looking for that.
4256440	4261420	Loki, tell Jamie a little bit about the story we covered earlier in the evening.
4261420	4265600	There's apparently a girl Grand Theft Auto type of game coming out, and Loki, what is
4265600	4267080	it you can do in this game?
4267080	4268960	You can do drugs.
4268960	4276040	You can also have sex with people for your own personal gain, spread rumors, stuff like
4276040	4277040	that.
4277040	4280200	Does this sound like the female Grand Theft Auto to you, doing drugs and pulling people's
4280200	4281200	hair?
4281200	4282200	No.
4282200	4288040	See, my perfect version would be this hardcore chick with an- we actually described him watching
4288040	4289040	Planet Terrace.
4289040	4291040	It would be worth a gallon.
4291040	4294360	And it's developed by a company called Champagne for the Ladies.
4294360	4297740	That's so stupid.
4297740	4298740	What about-
4298740	4299740	Okay.
4299740	4301960	Wait, who would be cooler, Rose McGowan or Tank Girl?
4301960	4305320	Ooh, that's a hard one.
4305320	4307800	That's a hard, hard one.
4307800	4311120	I don't know, Tank Girl's pretty hardcore, but she'd have to have the tanks.
4311120	4312120	That's true.
4312120	4316080	I think they should just make a Tank Girl video game, honestly.
4316080	4317080	That would be great.
4317080	4319080	Yeah, we were going to when it got canceled.
4319080	4320080	Doh.
4320080	4321080	Of course, she would have to do all the art work.
4321080	4324080	Yeah, I'm an original PlayStation.
4324080	4325080	All right.
4325080	4328760	Well, Ms. Dark Sakura, sorry you couldn't be here tonight, but you're going to miss
4328760	4332280	the great Wee Zapper Challenge, which is taking place after the show.
4332280	4334240	But we'll look forward to your return in a couple weeks.
4334240	4336520	Is there anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
4336520	4338520	I've already been challenged by Wee Zapper.
4338520	4341360	I fell on my foot before I left.
4341360	4343120	Well, congratulations on that.
4343120	4345380	I'm actually watching Eddie Izzard right now.
4345380	4347040	I hope the same doesn't happen to me.
4347040	4348440	Well, then go enjoy the Eddie Izzard.
4348440	4349440	All right.
4349440	4350440	All right.
4350440	4351440	Take care.
4351440	4352440	Bye, everybody.
4352440	4353440	Bye.
4353440	4354440	We'll be back in two weeks.
4354440	4355440	Bye-bye.
4355440	4359520	Jamie was very patient waiting on hold while I was doing the Classic Game of the Week,
4359520	4360520	so I appreciate that.
4360520	4361520	All right.
4361520	4362520	Let's go to the phones again.
4362520	4367040	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you can call, or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
4367040	4368360	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4368360	4369520	Who's this?
4369520	4370520	It's Ravenstaufen.
4370520	4371520	Hello, Ravenstaufen.
4371520	4372880	How are you?
4372880	4373880	I am okay.
4373880	4375440	A little cramped in here.
4375440	4376440	Little cramped?
4376440	4377440	Yeah.
4377440	4379560	My house is being renovated.
4379560	4382320	It's worked on, so I'm in a cramped little room right now.
4382320	4385640	Oh, I thought maybe you had the whole Thanksgiving family thing going on.
4385640	4389720	No, it was quiet, but enough about that.
4389720	4394440	My show can't stop talking about the damn Orange Box since it damn came out pissing
4394440	4395440	me off.
4395440	4396440	Why is that?
4396440	4397440	Well, damn.
4397440	4399440	What's so damn great about it?
4399440	4401240	Because I haven't been playing it.
4401240	4403320	That's all they've been talking about.
4403320	4405080	Don't you have control over it?
4405080	4408520	Can't you just say, hey, no more Orange Box?
4408520	4411560	I tried, and then they go like, no.
4411560	4412560	We got to play Portal.
4412560	4413560	Portal is awesome.
4413560	4414560	Ravenstaufen.
4414560	4415560	And then Game Portraits is awesome.
4415560	4417760	And then I'm like, you haven't played it very much.
4417760	4419400	It's like, yeah, it's very hardcore.
4419400	4421680	Yeah, it's very hardcore.
4421680	4423520	Offer them a cake if they shut up.
4423520	4428280	Wait, now, so did you just call in tonight to bitch about your own show's politics, or
4428280	4429280	what's the deal?
4429280	4430280	Oh, no.
4430280	4431280	Not at all.
4431280	4432280	All right.
4432280	4433280	What else is up?
4433280	4435080	You talked about Portal and all those games.
4435080	4436080	I guess it's your...
4436080	4437560	I haven't really played them still yet.
4437560	4439600	I'm like the least coolest kid on the block.
4439600	4440600	So you're just like me.
4440600	4441600	OK.
4441600	4442600	Now you're in the same boat.
4442600	4446040	Well, except Loki, one of the cool kids on the block is loaning me his copy.
4446040	4450560	So maybe by next week, I'll be sitting here giggling, going, hee hee, the cake is a lie.
4450560	4452480	You know, and all that stuff that everybody else is doing.
4452480	4455320	So we'll see.
4455320	4459040	Do you think, does this kind of stuff kind of irritate you when people go too far?
4459040	4460040	It does.
4460040	4461040	It pisses me off.
4461040	4462040	Really?
4462040	4463040	I'm sorry.
4463040	4466840	It pisses me off, especially when a commercial that goes, the greatest game of all time.
4466840	4471400	And with the PlayStation 3 version being very unplayable, Gabe Newell must really hate that
4471400	4472400	thing.
4472400	4478440	Apparently, there's not a lot of nice things to say about it from Valve.
4478440	4479440	I love it.
4479440	4482160	Technically, it's like, I hate the PlayStation 3.
4482160	4484400	I'm just going to gimp it.
4484400	4487400	Apparently, a lot of folks are doing that.
4487400	4488400	All right.
4488400	4491880	Well, any final thoughts for our listeners, Ravensdolphin?
4491880	4494680	No, but don't be in a cramped room.
4494680	4495680	All right.
4495680	4498400	We'll try to avoid that, even though the studio is a little cramped.
4498400	4499400	All right.
4499400	4500400	Take care.
4500400	4501400	Bye.
4501400	4505240	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4505240	4507280	How are you enjoying Jamie's chair tonight, Loki?
4507280	4508400	I never asked.
4508400	4509720	The big fluffy blue chair.
4509720	4510720	It's warm.
4510720	4511720	I don't know.
4511720	4514760	But then again, that might be my cold.
4514760	4515760	All right.
4515760	4517000	Let's go over to the phones, take some more calls.
4517000	4518000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4518000	4519000	Who's this?
4519000	4520000	Yo, this is Preston.
4520000	4521000	How you doing?
4521000	4522000	Hey, how you doing?
4522000	4523000	Better known as Xenocore.
4523000	4524000	Yep.
4524000	4525000	What's up, Xenocore?
4525000	4527800	Same old stuff, different day, man.
4527800	4528800	Gotcha.
4528800	4529800	What's your gaming week been like?
4529800	4532600	Actually, first off, did you have a good Thanksgiving?
4532600	4535240	Yeah, I got turkey for days, dude.
4535240	4536240	Awesome.
4536240	4537240	Leftovers.
4537240	4538240	Turkey and then turkey everything for a whole week.
4538240	4542760	Got turkey and nothing but turkey and sleeping for the next half week or so.
4542760	4543760	Gotcha.
4543760	4544760	So how was your gaming week?
4544760	4545760	What do we owe the call to tonight?
4545760	4549760	Well, I've been getting all of my November 20th gaming out of the way.
4549760	4554400	So finally managed to finish Assassin's Creed and saw the little cliffhanger ending they
4554400	4555400	gave us there.
4555400	4556960	That was kind of upsetting.
4556960	4557960	Interesting.
4557960	4561920	So did they set it up totally for a sequel, as many games do these days?
4561920	4566200	Well, yeah, but there was no end of the chapter, so to speak.
4566200	4568720	You just fall right off the cliff.
4568720	4570600	It's pitch black and you just walk right off the cliff.
4570600	4571600	OMG spoilers.
4571600	4572600	Next one.
4572600	4574000	Can we not spoil this?
4574000	4575600	No, it doesn't sound major.
4575600	4578880	What they did do is interesting.
4578880	4583160	You're definitely drawn to the story, so you still want to find out what's going on, but
4583160	4585040	you just hit that wall flat out.
4585040	4588280	There's no gentle slope to say, okay, now wait for the next one.
4588280	4592080	It's like, oh shit, now I got to go buy number two to figure out what's going on, but it's
4592080	4594120	kind of interesting what they did.
4594120	4595120	Interesting.
4595120	4598440	And Assassin's Creed apparently, since it's a brand new IP, right, and it's doing very
4598440	4602400	well for being a brand new IP, so it sounds like they already know there's going to be
4602400	4603400	an Assassin's Creed at some point.
4603400	4604720	Yeah, they're talking about the sequel.
4604720	4605720	Oh, wow.
4605720	4606720	Very cool.
4606720	4607720	Anything else you've been playing as Unicorn?
4607720	4611360	Yeah, I've been getting Mass Effect out the way.
4611360	4612360	How is that?
4612360	4613360	Let's check that out.
4613360	4615520	I'm very, very curious about Mass Effect.
4615520	4621120	Well, Loki, did you play the beta version or the demo version they had at the trade
4621120	4622840	shows, or did you actually play a full version of it?
4622840	4624720	No, I played a full version of it.
4624720	4628800	All right, because after the review I heard last week, I'm not sure if you were playing
4628800	4632360	the same game I am, because there wasn't that much talking before I started shooting anyway.
4632360	4635280	No, there's quite a bit of talking.
4635280	4639640	I disagree, but anyway, I'm used to Bioware stuff, so I guess I sort of gloss over it.
4639640	4641600	See, I didn't play anything from Bioware.
4641600	4645600	I didn't play Jade Empire or anything like that, so maybe this...
4645600	4646600	I could have been nitpicking.
4646600	4652320	I only had 30 minutes in my lunch, and I just want to kill you while there you go, and hey,
4652320	4655520	25 minutes of that lunch is spent talking.
4655520	4659160	Loki, you missed alien sex.
4659160	4660160	I didn't miss it.
4660160	4661800	There's no fucking alien sex in there.
4661800	4663760	It's implied sex.
4663760	4665360	That's bullshit.
4665360	4669680	Loki says fucking lifetime TV implied sex is what that is.
4669680	4671760	Penetration or it didn't happen.
4671760	4676960	Well, I can't confirm or deny that right now, because apparently, based off how far I've
4676960	4680840	gotten into the game, the scene they show isn't from a party member.
4680840	4686920	It's from an NPC, so if there is some party member fornicating, we haven't seen what it
4686920	4687920	looks like yet.
4687920	4690560	The plot thing is, apparently my friends...
4690560	4694260	See, the reason why I haven't bought Mass Effect is that there's just too many games
4694260	4698120	and not enough money in the wallet, however, one of my friends who got Mass Effect is already
4698120	4701360	halfway through the game and said he'll let me borrow it as soon as he finishes it, so
4701360	4703800	I'm hoping I can take a look at it for a future show.
4703800	4705080	I'll eventually get around to playing it.
4705080	4709000	I mean, it's just right now there's, like you said, too many things to play.
4709000	4713120	I'm trying to get rid of some of this, like, I looked at Crackdown, oh yeah, my copy of
4713120	4715440	Crackdown stopped working for some reason.
4715440	4716720	I fucking love Crackdown.
4716720	4718120	It refuses to work now.
4718120	4721480	What do you think about, I know you play a lot of RPGs, Xenocore, what do you think about
4721480	4723720	the conversation style in Mass Effect?
4723720	4724720	Is it really cool?
4724720	4726800	Is it something you'd like to see in more games?
4726800	4730960	Well, it's not anything different from what they've done previously.
4730960	4735840	It's still the same BioWare chat interface, they just put more visual cues and stuff in
4735840	4741700	it, so there's more interaction with the characters since everybody speaks, and there's more facial
4741700	4745440	animation so you can see emotion, but other than that, it's the same BioWare engine they've
4745440	4746440	always been using.
4746440	4747440	Nice.
4747440	4748440	All right.
4748440	4751880	Well, again, I'm like Loki, I didn't play the previous games, so Star Trek Amy.
4751880	4752880	You know what, guys?
4752880	4757240	I think I need to introduce you to Knights of the Old Republic, to Neverwinter Knights,
4757240	4761440	to Jade Empire, all these BioWare games that you haven't played.
4761440	4762440	None of those games I've played.
4762440	4764440	You need to.
4764440	4767280	And I gotta say, I realize there's a lot of folks listening to this show who think we're
4767280	4772520	experts on everything, but we're gamers just like you guys and we don't have time for everything,
4772520	4775560	but I definitely want to at least look at everything if I have a chance.
4775560	4778720	That's why I miss E3, because at E3 you can at least look at everything and kind of go,
4778720	4782960	yeah, I'm more interested in this or I'm not so interested in this, so yeah.
4782960	4783960	All right.
4783960	4786760	Well, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
4786760	4791320	Yeah, just one other point on Mass Effect, the rover kicks ass.
4791320	4794760	I mean, the Warthog is shit now.
4794760	4798840	The Land Rover you get to use in Mass Effect is the new ride I want, man.
4798840	4799840	Interesting.
4799840	4803000	There's so much detail put into the way that vehicle just operates.
4803000	4806240	I can just drive it all day on the planets and stuff, it's great.
4806240	4807240	Very cool.
4807240	4811320	I mean, it's kind of interesting hearing about a lot of big games of the year getting compared
4811320	4815040	to Halo 3 where it looks like Halo 3 may not be the game of the year.
4815040	4818740	There's all these other games that are doing these other little things, whereas a lot of
4818740	4820640	folks kind of thought Halo 3 may take the ground.
4820640	4822040	It may not, but we'll see.
4822040	4826880	Yeah, it's because it's Halo 2.5 and not Halo 3.
4826880	4828120	That may be it right there.
4828120	4829120	All right.
4829120	4831200	Well, Xenocore, we got to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in before we go,
4831200	4833200	but thank you so much for calling, okay?
4833200	4834200	No problem.
4834200	4835200	Take it easy, guys.
4835200	4836200	All right.
4836200	4837200	Take care, buddy.
4837200	4841720	If you want to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.
4841720	4843320	Don't be deterred if you go straight to voicemail.
4843320	4848000	If you're going straight to voicemail, it's just because we're on another call, so don't
4848000	4849720	cry if you get voicemail.
4849720	4851880	Meanwhile, some last-minute stories real quick if we have any.
4851880	4854560	Omega 5 is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.
4854560	4855560	Oh.
4855560	4857120	Looking for a kick-ass shooter.
4857120	4861920	Wait, that's not the same thing as the Omega Warhawk expansion.
4861920	4862920	No.
4862920	4863920	Omega 5.
4863920	4864920	Oh.
4864920	4866320	It's a Hudson shooter.
4866320	4867320	Interesting.
4867320	4868320	All right.
4868320	4869320	Hello.
4869320	4870320	You're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
4870320	4871320	Who's this?
4871320	4872320	What's up?
4872320	4873320	This is Dillinger.
4873320	4874320	Hi, Dillinger.
4874320	4878320	I'm usually 3ama, but I kind of felt like a name change.
4878320	4879320	All right.
4879320	4880320	Well, hey.
4880320	4881320	You know what?
4881320	4882320	When it's your nickname, you have the right to do that.
4882320	4885520	You're a little bit quiet, so make sure you get a little closer to your mic and tell us
4885520	4886520	what's on your mind.
4886520	4887520	All right.
4887520	4890880	I wanted to talk a bit about Mario Galaxy.
4890880	4897960	I've basically been playing it over the entire Thanksgiving break, and I've got to say that
4897960	4902200	if you've got a Wii, you have to buy this game.
4902200	4906840	It is kind of childish, and it's a bit easy at the beginning, but once you really get
4906840	4911000	into the game, especially the later stuff, you only have to have... It's another one
4911000	4916920	of the... There's 120 stars that you can get, and you only have to have 60 to go to
4916920	4923480	the final boss, but the final 60 is just... It is better than everything else in the game.
4923480	4927360	It is better than a lot of the stuff in Mario 64, in my opinion.
4927360	4930200	There's some really innovative stuff in there.
4930200	4936180	I think that Mario Galaxy is basically the definite game to get for the Wii.
4936180	4939760	You know, it's kind of interesting because I can hear the excitement in your voice when
4939760	4944240	you're talking about games, and when you hear that excitement, it makes other people excited,
4944240	4949520	so certainly I liked the bits of Mario Galaxy that I have played so far.
4949520	4952400	I haven't bought the full game yet, but I'm kind of curious.
4952400	4956560	What did you think about the motion in that game, meaning like, you know how it was more
4956560	4958120	of a round environment?
4958120	4962280	I kind of thought it was a game where I'd be able to get disoriented very easily, even
4962280	4964000	more so than most 3D games.
4964000	4965000	Do you find that?
4965000	4968920	Was it kind of hard to kind of figure out where you were at in the game, or was it something
4968920	4971440	you just kind of pick up as you go?
4971440	4972440	Not really.
4972440	4975040	I found that you get used to it after a bit.
4975040	4979440	I mean, I've had a couple of friends over that have played it, my brothers played it,
4979440	4983680	and it's a little weird in the beginning, obviously, because you're getting used to
4983680	4989600	this whole new orientation, but after a little bit, you really get used to it.
4989600	4990600	Have you tried any of the co-op mode?
4990600	4993320	Because I know you said you had your friends over, and I noticed in a commercial I saw
4993320	4995340	the other day, they were really hyped in the co-op mode.
4995340	4996800	How is it?
4996800	4998560	Co-op isn't really anything great.
4998560	5004360	All that you can do is you can move your wiimote around and you can collect the stars for them,
5004360	5009440	or you can stun the enemies, or actually you can make them jump, so it's great, because
5009440	5011520	you can really mess around with your friends.
5011520	5015440	They'll be trying to jump somewhere, and you can tell them to jump earlier.
5015440	5019740	It's pretty stupid, but it's good for a lot.
5019740	5020880	Very cool.
5020880	5023960	Anything else on the Wii that you're looking forward to this holiday season, besides Super
5023960	5024960	World?
5024960	5025960	Trauma Center.
5025960	5026960	I'm a huge Trauma Center guy.
5026960	5029200	I loved Second Opinion.
5029200	5030520	I never played the DS one.
5030520	5036320	I sold my DS before it came out, but I'm really looking forward to New Blood.
5036320	5040160	I know it's already out, but I also really want to get Geometry Wars.
5040160	5046040	I played it once at my friend's house on Xbox, the 360 off of the live arcade or whatever
5046040	5049600	the hell it's called, and it was tons of fun.
5049600	5054220	I'm a really huge Gretsch guy, so I'm looking forward to that.
5054220	5057880	We interviewed the developers a couple weeks ago on the show, and it's going to be interesting,
5057880	5062800	because they are changing the way it works for the Wii, incorporating the motion control,
5062800	5064680	so I'm kind of excited to see how that works.
5064680	5065680	Oh, god.
5065680	5067240	Was that episode 251?
5067240	5069080	I don't remember which episode it was.
5069080	5070080	About three weeks ago.
5070080	5071080	Try 254, 253.
5071080	5073080	I think it was in there somewhere.
5073080	5075280	It's probably still on iTunes.
5075280	5079120	I vaguely remember you guys doing an interview in Part B of 251.
5079120	5082440	I don't remember if it was that or what, but yeah, it's somewhere in there, so check it
5082440	5083440	out.
5083440	5084440	What was the other thing I wanted to say?
5084440	5087320	Trauma Center is a game I like as well, and that reminds me, that's something I want to
5087320	5092120	look at, too, is the new Trauma Center game, because it's not just a DS port, like it was
5092120	5093120	actually made for the Wii.
5093120	5094120	Yeah, I heard it got good reviews.
5094120	5095120	Oh, I'm excited.
5095120	5096120	I got to check that out.
5096120	5097640	Above average reviews.
5097640	5099320	That was a great game for the Wii.
5099320	5102120	I will never forget, because I didn't really play the DS one either.
5102120	5104240	I kind of skipped it when it came on DS, but I played it on Wii.
5104240	5107440	I will never forget the first time you have to use the defibrillators, and you're like
5107440	5110720	clear, and you have to actually push towards the screen.
5110720	5111720	It's great.
5111720	5112720	I love Trauma Center.
5112720	5114720	I need to check that out, too.
5114720	5115720	All right.
5115720	5116720	Well, Dillinger, thanks so much for the call.
5116720	5120360	We've got to take a couple more calls, but any quick final thoughts for our listeners?
5120360	5122360	Quick final thoughts.
5122360	5125280	Dragon Force is the greatest band ever.
5125280	5129680	I mean, I freaked out when I heard that they were going to be in Guitar Hero 3, even though
5129680	5132200	I can't be through the fire and the plans aren't expert.
5132200	5133200	Rock on.
5133200	5134200	I agree.
5134200	5135200	Dragon Force is amazing.
5135200	5136360	I still want them on the show.
5136360	5137360	We'll see.
5137360	5138760	Maybe that'll be my Christmas present.
5138760	5139760	We'll see.
5139760	5140760	That'd be great.
5140760	5141760	All right.
5141760	5142760	We'll see you later.
5142760	5143760	It was nice to have you on the program.
5143760	5144760	You, too.
5144760	5148920	And have fun with Mario Galaxy, and good luck in getting all those 120 what-have-you stars
5148920	5150320	that are in that game.
5150320	5151740	It's nuts.
5151740	5155480	Any other last-minute stories you got for us, Logie?
5155480	5156480	There's one I forgot.
5156480	5162240	I didn't make show roll for some reason, but Night's Journey into Dreams is coming to the
5162240	5166760	PlayStation 2, the original Night's that was on the Saturn.
5166760	5167760	Nice.
5167760	5170360	You know, I think probably it didn't make the show roll because we had a short show
5170360	5171360	tonight, but I'm glad.
5171360	5173120	Well, I didn't put it on there, so.
5173120	5174120	Oh, well, then.
5174120	5175120	I forgot.
5175120	5176120	All right.
5176120	5178760	No, I do remember reading that, though, so very cool.
5178760	5180440	Let's go to one more call for tonight.
5180440	5181440	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5181440	5183440	Who's this?
5183440	5187320	Aww, caller, are you there?
5187320	5188720	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5188720	5190920	If you're there, say hello.
5190920	5198760	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
5198760	5199760	Caller's not there.
5199760	5204120	Folks, you want to use Echo 1-2-3 to test your connection before you give us a call,
5204120	5206160	or you could just use a regular telephone as well.
5206160	5207160	That always works.
5207160	5214800	Always got to love when the last call tonight is something that fails.
5214800	5218800	Anyhow, let's go ahead and wrap up.
5218800	5222920	On that note, let's wrap up the show tonight.
5222920	5224880	So we're going to do our challenge on Op 11, yes?
5224880	5226280	We're going to do our crossbow challenge?
5226280	5227280	Yes, you're welcome.
5227280	5228280	Awesome.
5228280	5229840	Let's go around and hear everybody's final thought.
5229840	5233400	If there's no other last minute stories, let's go around and hear everybody's final
5233400	5234400	thought.
5234400	5235400	Drew, thanks for filling in tonight.
5235400	5239040	Sorry you got robbed of half a show, but come back.
5239040	5240040	Oh, I will.
5240040	5241040	I will.
5241040	5246040	And you did get to peek at what we have coming in 2008 out in the, well, we don't call it
5246040	5247040	a garage.
5247040	5248040	We call it a new studio.
5248040	5249040	What do you think?
5249040	5250040	It'll be interesting.
5250040	5251040	I am impressed.
5251040	5252920	I hope that it all goes well.
5252920	5253920	I hope so.
5253920	5254920	We'll see.
5254920	5256720	Did you change something since I last looked for it?
5256720	5257720	No.
5257720	5260800	It's kind of funny stuff, but kind of just explaining the concepts and what we hope to
5260800	5261800	have up.
5261800	5262800	So this would be very cool.
5262800	5265240	It's kind of like, remember when you and I shared a place, we had a lot of cool stuff
5265240	5266240	there we haven't had since?
5266240	5267240	Yeah.
5267240	5268240	Like a TV and stuff?
5268240	5269240	We had to destroy that.
5269240	5270240	We're going to have it back.
5270240	5271240	Oh, poor thing.
5271240	5272240	All right, your final thoughts.
5272240	5274240	Drew, did I get your final thoughts?
5274240	5275240	No.
5275240	5276240	Then what's your final thoughts, Drew?
5276240	5277640	I needs my wow.
5277640	5278640	Addict.
5278640	5279640	Loki.
5279640	5284720	I feel hot and I hope I don't have a fever because that would suck.
5284720	5291280	And my final thought is I want more pumpkin pie and then I don't like pumpkin coffee and
5291280	5292280	pumpkin everything.
5292280	5294720	I want pumpkin everything.
5294720	5295720	That's what I want.
