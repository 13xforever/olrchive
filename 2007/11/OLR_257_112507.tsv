13987	25642	Tonight, November 25th, 2007, Guitar Hero gets sued for sounding too good, Super Mario Galaxy has super sales, and Captain Kirk officially endorses World of Warcraft.
31820	33261	Hello, everybody out there on the Internet.
33321	35742	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35782	41265	We are that video game program dedicated, of course, to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41485	42505	My name is Rob Roberts.
42866	45327	Joining me not tonight is DarkSakura.
45387	46227	She has the night off.
46307	48709	She's off for the holidays in Alabama.
49269	50850	We might hear from her a little bit later, though.
50890	51230	We'll see.
51670	54312	But joining us in studio, say hello to the one and only Loki.
54712	54932	Hello.
54972	56313	How are you doing, Loki?
56753	57353	I'm doing fine.
57613	57893	All right.
57973	60815	And since we had an extra seat tonight, we thought we'd bring back
61411	64212	A familiar guest for those that have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for some time.
64272	66392	Say hello to Intern Drew is here tonight.
66612	67252	What's up, guys?
67372	67892	How you doing?
68412	68833	Ah, fair.
69073	69333	Good.
69413	75294	So, Drew, since DarkSakura's not here tonight, we are going to be relying on you to present the female perspective of gaming.
75614	76934	Wouldn't that be your job, Rob?
77214	77634	Um, no.
78315	79155	What are you trying to imply?
80055	80815	Trying to say something?
81315	81855	Oh, nothing.
81895	82515	Nothing at all.
82635	83156	That's what I thought.
83216	83476	All right.
84176	85476	Let's get us started tonight.
85516	87697	We're going to talk about how is your gaming week.
87877	89977	And since Jamie's not here, we'll start with Loki.
91413	93034	Um, well, let's see.
93134	96436	My gaming week was not filled with Rock Band.
96476	97336	You'd be surprised.
97356	99918	I didn't really play Rock Band this week.
99978	110784	Instead, like Guitar Hero and all the other music games before them, they are sitting in a nice bundle in a box or whatever in the corner of the room while I play other things.
111584	114786	Um, we played actually some Project Gotham Racing 3 this week.
114966	116146	We did a little multiplayer on that.
116527	117447	Wait, Project Gotham Racing 3?
117527	117847	Three.
118108	118888	Old school.
119246	127969	Well, it's the reason why we played that one instead of 4 is because I have 5 copies of Project Gotham Racing 3 and not 5 copies of Project Gotham Racing 4.
128869	131630	Makes it a little difficult to play that game multiplayer otherwise.
132210	136651	Anyways, so we did that, and then Saints Row, of course, as usual.
137432	141373	And a little bit of Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, which is fun.
142413	144914	A little bit of Catan, because that's also fun.
145763	163870	and then the game I've been mainly playing the last few days is Zelda Phantom Hourglass because I, you know, originally I had a DS and then it was a nice, you know, silver fat one, you know, like it came out at launch and then the music came on and everything went to hell.
163990	165411	I swear to God, everything's broken tonight.
165531	169172	Those who are listening live tonight, we had to do three retakes to start the show tonight.
169192	170453	It's like Jamie's not here.
170473	171113	It all falls apart.
171133	171994	I don't know what the hell's going on.
172014	172434	Sorry.
172454	173074	Here we go again.
173874	174174	Anyways...
175788	196217	So then, let's see, so yeah, basically ended up trading my silver DS fat for a pink DS light for my wife, and then I bought a non-pink DS light for myself, a black one, so now I have my true official game for myself, because my wife has claimed all the other ones.
198778	199879	What else did I play this week?
200439	200779	I think that's
201743	207786	I imagine because of the holidays and all, everybody's gaming weeks was a little bit abbreviated.
208266	209826	Yeah, yeah, I guess.
210067	211047	Did you have a good turkey day?
211687	212848	Uh, yeah, we had two turkeys.
214048	214408	Pig?
214428	215569	No, no, no, no.
215929	217730	We did not eat two turkeys.
218070	219450	We had two turkeys.
219630	220051	I see.
220111	221311	One of them was at the table.
221671	225073	No, we had, we had, um, because it's an interesting story.
225133	225473	It's like, um,
226848	234574	We had Thanksgiving over at Nellie's parents' house, and they had bought a turkey, and then Nellie's dad won a turkey at work.
234654	241039	The ironic thing is he doesn't like turkey, but he won one anyways, so they had two turkeys there.
242200	245123	You know, that's funny, because I don't like turkey either, so they always have to make ham.
246023	247284	You know, turkey's not bad.
247304	251868	It's just like, I don't want to... They were trying to feed me tons of that turkey, and I'm like...
252561	254002	I'm not eating all that.
254183	255724	Oh, then they wanted me to carve the turkey.
255764	257385	I'm like, I don't know how to fucking carve a turkey.
257725	260127	I'll give it my best try, but shit.
262109	263070	So yeah, that was my gaming week.
263830	264091	Nice.
264151	265572	Drew, intern Drew, you want to go next?
266292	266613	Sure.
267353	270396	Actually, I haven't been playing much World of Warcraft since my subscription expired.
271196	271597	Cry.
272257	276401	But surprisingly, I've been involved in FPS.
276661	279303	I've been playing Battlefield 2 and getting my ranking up.
279870	283291	All the way to Sergeant so far, which is kind of cool.
283451	284251	I like playing a medic.
285792	294255	Other than that, second playthrough of Tales of Symphonia, catching in some Twilight Princess and a little Wild Arms 4.
295095	297776	Not much spectacular, but it's fun stuff.
299216	299536	Alrighty.
300697	301397	My gaming week.
301457	301897	Let's see.
302217	306899	I've been playing the brand new Final Fantasy XI expansion, Wings of the Goddess, which...
307731	311052	Dear Square Enix, I mean, you really blew it with this.
311252	312953	I mean, I don't know what to say.
313093	314413	Now, the game itself is cool.
314433	315134	Let me get to that in a minute.
315154	315954	I'm talking about the launch.
316034	329759	Okay, when you have an MMO and you're going to launch an expansion, you can expect that, like, all your freaking players who are addicted to this game, especially Final Fantasy XI people who are pretty rabid about Final Fantasy XI, are going to be in on this game trying to register the game.
330019	332180	You can expect they're going to all be on at once.
332280	333000	And so what happens?
333300	335181	Their registration servers go down.
336118	336699	DarkSakura.com
351747	353669	Stuck at authenticating.
354370	359936	Well, basically, it was just lots of people were hammering the servers and it was basically breaking it.
360717	363440	Or they just thought that your copy was not authentic enough.
364101	365542	Well, I'm looking right at it.
365582	367024	Does this not look like the real deal?
367084	367424	Hello?
367504	370247	That looks like the real deal forgery to me.
370328	370668	Here's the thing.
370748	374490	Here's the other thing is that the PC version of the game was delayed.
374890	379653	The game was supposed to hit shelves on what, like Tuesday or, no, ship Tuesday to shelf Wednesday, right?
379933	380513	And then what happens?
380553	385476	The PC version gets delayed by a day, which means that in reality it didn't come out on Thanksgiving, obviously.
385496	386797	It came out on Black Friday.
386997	387277	Rob.
387417	387577	What?
388507	391951	What Final Fantasy game would it be if it weren't delayed a little bit?
392072	396217	But the fun thing is, it was only the PC version in the US that got delayed.
396237	402505	So everybody's playing Dancer and Scholar, all the people in Japan and Europe are playing the new classes, and all the PC players are just...
403365	403746	Tear.
404326	406569	But I mean, this is how rabid people are, okay?
406629	410613	You look at the Final Fantasy XI forums, and people are like, okay, here's what you can do.
410914	414758	You can go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game.
414798	416821	This is a real threat I saw on Wednesday, the workaround.
417101	419003	Go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game.
421192	422473	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
441352	443533	Fucking addicts, just wait your turn.
443593	447455	We have to wait for our... This is what I finally decided to do, is wait.
447635	449676	I guess people are still having problems getting on there.
449696	451636	I did finally get my copy registered yesterday.
451656	454197	I guess they fixed some servers, but they kind of botched the launch.
454678	465402	As for the game itself, I was kind of hoping for a little bit more for the users that are not at the endgame level yet, like me, because I've been playing this game for how many years yet?
465442	469524	I can never seem to level a job past like 55, because I have extreme ADD.
470454	473617	Well, that and all the fucking level cap quests suck.
474598	478921	But I got to say, you know, with all the changes they made to Final Fantasy XI, they've made a lot of changes for the better.
479201	482584	They've made items not so impossible to get in many ways.
483324	485346	The economy's eh.
486233	487233	I don't know.
487253	488854	I think the game's made a lot of improvements.
488894	490715	Classes have gotten changes that needed it.
491035	492275	And the new classes are pretty cool.
492315	495336	Dancer's pretty awesome and helps with small parties.
495377	496337	And Scholar's kind of cool, too.
496377	499698	You mean I don't have to compete with bots to get a frickin' pair of lizard boots anymore?
499718	504580	Well, they're Rare EX now, so it does them no good to camp Lizzie because the boots are Rare EX.
504720	506521	So if they get it, they can't sell it.
506681	509582	I would camp it and drop the boots just to piss people off.
511104	511625	That'd be awesome.
511645	513108	That's a lot of time, though.
513128	515413	You call me sad for clicking retry over and over.
515433	516215	You should play WoW.
516436	517638	They welcome people like you.
517819	519202	I don't have time to do that stuff.
519242	519863	I mean, come on.
519923	520745	Look at my gaming week.
521912	522492	I don't know.
551843	558410	Anyhow, the game itself, I need a little more time to explore the new areas, but I like some of the new music and some of the old areas I went into.
558450	560292	Are there any new areas?
560902	563403	Well, they're the old areas 20 years ago.
563443	567544	So there's different mobs and the, you know, it's not the exact same thing with different colors.
567584	574006	Like, for instance, one of the areas I traveled to in the past, Rollinberry Fields, you go to it in the past and you see, like, destruction.
574026	577647	Because it's supposed to be, like, 20 years ago when the war was going on, the Crystal War was going on.
577967	578888	You see destruction.
578908	582649	Like, there'll be holes in the path where it looks like cannonballs have struck the path and things like that.
582709	584509	So it's not, like, the exact same thing with different colors.
584529	586230	Can you go to the towns and stuff when they're like that, too?
586250	589911	You can't go to Juno, but apparently you can go to the other big three, Sandoria and
590563	592225	Yay, Caverns of Time!
593526	599811	Yes, but the Crystal War thing was written in the XI story long before WoW was out, so you can't say they did off WoW.
599831	602113	That's debatable.
602133	603675	Watch the intro movie sometime.
604155	606738	I know, but they've had that in since Warcraft 2.
606978	607718	Can't we have both?
607899	608779	Isn't there room for both?
608859	610601	Why has it always got to be WoW versus whatever?
611021	611702	There's room for both.
611742	614224	I'm playing both right now, and not much else.
614244	615666	That's because you're a double addict.
616026	617127	But I did play Rock Band.
618356	619116	I bought Rock Band.
619176	624138	I did not spend $170 on the Deluxe Bundle.
624338	632020	After our preview last week, I was like, you know, I just don't think I'm going to want to go through the setup of setting up the drums and everything this much.
632060	636742	As much as I love that guitar, I thought the guitar was a great controller, I'm kind of pissed off.
637293	639436	The companies can't play together.
639696	642399	You know how that guitar won't work with Guitar Hero?
642479	643701	It will.
643821	644662	There was some compatibility.
644722	645583	Only on PlayStation 3.
645663	646524	Only on PS3.
646725	648707	Well, that does me a fuck of a lot of good.
648787	651010	Actually, if I remember correctly, I think it was...
653117	658079	I want to say the Rock Band ones weren't working on Guitar Hero 3 or something like that.
658480	661041	All I know is that the Guitar Hero 2 controller works with both.
661221	662061	So I'm like, you know what?
662141	663362	I'll just continue to use that.
663422	666463	Even though my yellow button is starting to stick a little bit, I'll just use that.
666723	669905	Because the Rock Band songs aren't particularly hard.
670325	673587	Like, I notice I'm doing way better on hard level on Rock Band than I do on Guitar Hero.
673967	676228	But I think that's just because... I think...
677239	687944	It's a little bit better of a learning curve than Guitar Hero because in the hard difficulty on Rock Band, I noticed they add the fifth button, but they don't use it a lot, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero.
687964	690165	So you get some time to adjust to that.
690565	690865	I don't know.
691165	692786	Because your pinkies are weak.
693066	696067	Yeah, I haven't had as much problems adjusting to Rock Band at all.
696367	699208	But to be honest, I've only explored single player mode.
699228	700469	I have yet to make a band.
702096	703317	So I have yet to explore that mode.
703437	707080	So I can't really give a full review on the game, other than I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.
707441	710303	That's because you don't have any friends, because of how unlikable you are.
710323	712525	I want to be able to make a band for single player.
713125	715607	Like, I want to be able to make my bandmates, you know?
716468	728037	That's what I kind of... I was under the impression that's what you were going to be able to do, was to make your own, like, bands, and make your characters, and you can, like, play each one individually, and then have them all come together, but I guess not.
729278	730419	Because there would be no bass man.
731892	736133	So, yeah, because there's no base single player mode, which I was surprised to find out too.
736273	738634	So, I guess there's little places they can improve.
738654	740435	But I love the presentation of Rock Band.
740475	745016	I love the way it looks and how your characters get integrated into like the loading screens.
745056	745896	I think that's hilarious.
746176	747357	So, very cool.
748377	751818	Other than that, not a whole lot else I've been playing because of Thanksgiving and all.
752278	753679	And mine was great, thanks for asking.
753699	754259	Very small.
754599	756759	We did not have two turkeys like Loki's house did.
758140	758480	All right.
759062	762985	I thought I said at the end of last week's show we were going to be here after all, but maybe not, I don't know
786413	790454	I know we were kind of going back and forth, so we are here this week, but only for one part.
790494	792154	There will not be two parts to this week's show.
792214	798775	However, I do believe, in lieu of a Part B, I believe the Wii Zapper Challenge is happening tonight.
798915	799195	Yes.
799335	799595	Yes.
800035	803396	So we will be on Op 11 after the show, and of course this will be archived.
803716	811817	We will be doing the Wii Zapper Challenge where Loki has said that he does not need the Wii Zapper to do good in the game, so he's going to play with just the normal Wiimote.
811917	815258	I will be using the Wii Zapper, and whoever gets the higher score or what have you...
816241	816601	I don't know.
818463	820025	If I win, you have to take me out.
820346	821848	If you win, I have to take Nellie out.
821868	822889	But what if she won't go out with me?
823830	824611	I don't know.
824651	825852	Then I'll buy you guys dinner or something.
825872	826413	We'll make it a lot easier.
826433	827554	If I win, you get me a $20 gift card to some
833479	837340	I still haven't seen the MPD I actually have seen the MPD numbers come up for October but
862128	864989	I believe the eye judgment was just within that.
866230	874993	Although, in a few more weeks, we'll have the NPD numbers for November, and I'll let you guys know where eye judgment is standing as far as sales go.
875033	876534	On its way to a million in six months.
876654	877494	Yeah, right.
877514	877995	Sounds good.
878295	881736	All right, chat, who said you guys could come up with what the terms of the bet are?
882116	886318	Now, the chat is expressing some disappointment because they were looking forward to the Loki-Rob date.
887338	888299	We'll work something out.
888799	889939	I'll make them buy me dinner still.
889959	890280	Don't worry.
890800	891060	All right.
892020	894022	So stay tuned for that after the show tonight.
894342	898285	That's really all I got for housekeeping other than, you know, stay on top of our communities.
898485	903830	We love having more folks on our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal and our MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.
904190	911136	I always neglect to mention Facebook, but we do have a group on there, the OL Army, so just search for OLRMY, you'll find it, or Orange Lounge Radio, it'll come up as well.
911516	915159	Sorry, Facebook, but there's just so goddamn many apps on Facebook.
915179	920664	Like, every day I'm getting some freaking request for, like, so-and-so wants to play vampire with you and suck your blood.
920704	920944	I'm like...
922173	922553	Sorry.
923134	924154	Yeah, thanks, Drew.
924614	925314	All right, so there you have it.
926935	931757	Also, the Guitar Hero OL Army fell out of the top 100 this week, and that makes me a sad panda.
931797	933898	So we need more recruits for the Guitar Hero OL Army.
934418	935438	You can find us on GuitarHero.com.
935458	936939	You can just search for OL Army.
937492	941336	However, I will say that Richie Maniac still has the number one spot on my Xbox Live list.
942016	946180	He's on my list, and he's on the Guitar Hero All-Army, and he has like a million groupies.
946760	948302	Damn you and your achievement horrors.
948382	952665	I think he has 2,500 groupies, which is definitely the highest I've seen, so good job.
953826	956209	Alright, let's get into some gaming news then.
956269	957169	Who's going to start us off tonight?
957189	957470	Loki?
958130	959351	Yeah, I will start us off.
959872	962714	Anyways, as we kind of teased in the intro there...
964431	968073	The Romantics, a wonderful 80s band, I guess.
970074	972195	Yeah, I'm being sarcastic there.
972716	981561	They are suing over a cover version of their song What I Like About You that appeared in Guitar Hero Encore, Rocks the 80s.
982021	985763	Because apparently, the song sounds too much like them.
986503	991066	They want the game sales to be halted, and want...
991519	999364	Accounting of all profits from the game along with unspecified compensation and punitive damages.
1001586	1009832	So apparently their claim is that the song is virtually indistinguishable from the authentic version and therefore would confuse the consumer.
1010572	1015155	But, you know, I don't know.
1015175	1020599	It's like, I'm just thinking if it's virtually indistinguishable then what's it matter?
1021067	1025248	It's not like, you know, it sounds like crap and, you know, people are thinking that's the real song.
1025608	1029449	And after that, they're going to sue everyone who five stars on an expert.
1030829	1039871	You know, I would think that in the court of law, it's going to come down and the judge is going to say, can we just all agree that this song is so 20 years ago and you all need to get over it?
1040551	1043652	Or the fact that they probably paid to have the licensing of that song?
1043752	1046973	Because, I mean, I'm sure even though they didn't get the real artist to sing it,
1047435	1050497	They have, you know, the license, the rights to the song.
1050777	1055939	Do you think it's one of those cases where, like, the record company signed it over without them knowing?
1056300	1057000	Like, that type of thing?
1057040	1058221	Well, I'm not surprised there.
1058741	1059101	Exactly.
1059121	1060562	Didn't a similar thing happen in DDR?
1061622	1062143	Possibly.
1062243	1068366	Someone was saying, like, Strictly Business, but I don't see how that... That's a licensed song off of Dance Mania.
1068386	1076550	Well, the thing with Strictly Business is that the original artist of the song never consented to the song being in the game, and one of the artists went into an arcade one day and saw people playing the song...
1076983	1078283	and was like, what the hell is this?
1078783	1080124	We never said the song could be in the game.
1081184	1082384	But the record company did it.
1082604	1086485	You know, Rob, they didn't raise much of a fuss when it was in Karaoke Revolution Party.
1087545	1088045	Interesting.
1088065	1089405	But again, it wasn't a very good cover.
1090045	1095906	And plus, Karaoke Revolution doesn't quite have that pop culture recognizability that Guitar Hero does.
1096267	1097067	Let's actually listen.
1097307	1098207	Let's hear some clips.
1098247	1101928	Here's the original version of What I Like About You by The Romantics.
1103008	1103528	It's buffering.
1103568	1104188	It's a little slow.
1107297	1119185	Okay, that song's still kind of fun, I have to admit.
1119685	1120406	I bounce up and down.
1120746	1123388	Alright, let's listen to what the cover sounds like.
1123488	1126030	This is by The Wave Group, and you actually can get this on iTunes.
1126070	1128632	I'm just getting the clips actually right out of iTunes as well.
1147136	1149417	You know, I gotta say, it really does sound a lot similar.
1149477	1150197	No, it doesn't.
1150638	1152118	A little bit, a little bit.
1152379	1153219	Not even close.
1153259	1154440	Pursuing over that?
1154660	1155400	What a crock.
1156901	1158181	Well, let's see, let's see.
1158982	1161663	Now, keep in mind, there's other bands that cover this.
1162203	1165945	So, I just had a curiosity, just as like a, what do you call that, a control?
1166165	1167926	Like when you're doing a science experiment, you have to have a control?
1168266	1170867	So, let's actually take a look at a completely different cover.
1171348	1174049	So, from the band Kid Pop Rock and Roll Hits...
1174557	1177580	Rob, here's the hit crew with What I Like About You.
1179862	1180743	Oh shit, it's buffering.
1181704	1182065	Here we go.
1193416	1194798	Virtually undistinguishable.
1194938	1197581	I know, honestly, that's pretty similar too.
1199443	1204006	I thought Kidz Bop was reserved for cage match punishment.
1204546	1205967	Make the hurting stop.
1206007	1208448	I was not Kidz Bop, it was Kidz Pop.
1209108	1210029	Same damn thing.
1210089	1210589	Big difference.
1210629	1211690	No, big fucking difference.
1211850	1214351	That's a P, not a B, okay?
1215032	1217213	I would also like to point out, okay, I got one more for you guys.
1218153	1222356	This song was also covered on an album called The Barbie Hit Mix.
1228208	1229349	See, that's Barbie singing.
1230350	1232551	Okay, I have one question.
1233212	1236675	How effective is this mic as a bludgeoning instrument of death?
1241318	1244581	Honestly, the guitars and everything sound very similar.
1244601	1246322	Why does Barbie look like one of the Olsen twins?
1246342	1247703	That's what I'm wondering, too.
1247743	1250125	I'm looking at the cover of this going, wow, Barbie got really slutty.
1250986	1251686	So there you have it.
1252527	1253548	Got really slutty?
1254718	1258021	Nim in chat says, Barbie is made of plastic, no mouth.
1258081	1259022	How does she talk?
1260804	1262685	Same the way Britney Spears does.
1263726	1265888	You know, given the same circumstances.
1266268	1267329	I'll give you a hint, kids.
1267609	1268570	It's the devil.
1271312	1272193	So there you have it.
1273394	1274175	They're being sued.
1274875	1275476	What do you think?
1275696	1276517	Drew, what do you think?
1276757	1278178	Is there any weight to this lawsuit?
1278218	1280520	Do you think the romantics have a claim here or what?
1280860	1281101	No.
1282879	1286302	No, it is not even remotely similar.
1287423	1290466	It's similar as me singing this song, okay?
1290486	1291167	I mean, seriously.
1291187	1292008	Oh, oh, would you?
1292508	1294010	No, I won't.
1294870	1295391	Sorry, Rob.
1295411	1295951	You will.
1295971	1299014	No, it's just, it's stupid.
1300255	1300836	It's stupid.
1301554	1307939	I say yes, it's similar, but at the same time, somebody who had the rights to this song agreed to let the song in the game.
1308639	1315504	Now, if it came out that the developers got no permission to use this song whatsoever, then I would say they have a case.
1316705	1325490	Seeing as I'm pretty sure they got the rights somewhere, whether that be they went directly to the record label and never approached the band, well, then the band should take that up with the record label.
1325530	1329212	Why are you signing our stuff over to video games that are going to remake our songs too similarly?
1329292	1332654	Or why didn't you just let them use the original version for more money or what have you?
1333134	1339298	I think if the song was licensed, then go QQ some more, Romantics.
1339378	1343080	Or perhaps the band should have a more unique voice that can't be copied so easily.
1344226	1345266	What the fuck is wrong with them?
1345726	1350888	DMN Nourishment says in chat, bottom line, sue the record company for signing and not Activision.
1350968	1351988	Stop fucking whining.
1353629	1355970	Nim says, there's a difference between similar and same.
1356010	1358991	If it's a cover, then it's different, and they are going to be made a fool of.
1360231	1363932	Escapist says, I want to see Loki pop advertised on late night TV.
1364592	1367934	And Radink360 says, Loki should sing it in the Tingle costume.
1368894	1369374	There you have it.
1370871	1372171	Lots of love for Loki singing.
1372392	1374632	I think you could put out an album that would be bigger than Shatner.
1375052	1376153	I don't want to do that.
1376833	1381055	Well, not that I could tell you where you can find clips on the internet of Loki singing, but I'll give you a hint.
1381555	1384616	Rock Band is the topic of our next story.
1385496	1387517	And we did something with Rock Band very recently.
1388517	1392438	Anyhow, Rock Band has opened up a store.
1392519	1392939	That's right.
1392979	1394539	There's a new store with accessories.
1394899	1398020	There's a whole drum bag you can actually buy on this store.
1398060	1398421	It's a $50 bag.
1400014	1402315	to basically keep that whole drum set in.
1402535	1403036	I want that.
1403256	1404156	It is kind of nice, but it's $50.
1404276	1405417	I don't care.
1405457	1406417	I want that.
1406437	1408058	Is it worth $50, though?
1408118	1409019	It is worth $50.
1409179	1409739	You know why, though?
1409759	1412180	Because have you ever tried buying a bag for consoles?
1412760	1414841	Trust me, I have numerous times.
1415322	1419304	Those fucking backpacks that they have for the Xbox 360 are like $70.
1419804	1420824	It's fucking ridiculous.
1421285	1421825	That looks nice.
1422512	1429236	Yeah, I gotta admit, it does look kinda nice, but I don't know, I mean, like, god, you already spent $170 on the game, do you really need to spend $50 more?
1429256	1439963	Well, they have, like, you can buy actual guitars on that website and shit, like... Yeah, I know, there's other members... It's like, I just bought $169 worth of fake instruments, let's buy some real ones too, yay!
1442244	1445426	By the way, before we get to the next story, speaking of Guitar Hero, I'm a little...
1445964	1447665	A little more Guitar Hero, a little less Rock Band.
1448085	1449065	Did you see that thing?
1449386	1453588	And Tiger Claw was sharing this with our forum people, and he was asking me about this before the show.
1453608	1455709	Did you see that whole Guitar Hero in the blender thing?
1456069	1456649	I love that website.
1456669	1458070	They put that on the Will It Blend.
1458410	1459710	That is the question.
1460651	1462492	And they actually put the controller in the blender.
1463192	1463892	Well, half of it.
1464052	1465913	I don't mean to post spoilers, but yes.
1466914	1469175	Everything blends, except for Norris.
1469195	1470455	I love that website now.
1470636	1471356	You should check that out.
1471376	1473577	I giggled my head off watching that.
1474716	1477438	Rob, I like how Loki used the appropriate verb.
1477718	1481220	He didn't laugh, he giggled when he watched Will It Blend.
1481361	1481641	Rob?
1481961	1482201	Yes.
1483322	1485844	They did put Chuck Norris in the blender on that segment.
1485884	1488345	What, like a cardboard cutout or something?
1488485	1489026	Action figure.
1489386	1491648	Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.
1493589	1498712	I apologize to all listeners for bringing up Chuck, but it had to be done.
1498732	1503936	I'm telling you, those people that are behind the marketing of that blender...
1504298	1505319	are fucking geniuses.
1506079	1508401	It is absolutely the best thing.
1508861	1510482	And that's the entry-level blender.
1510562	1512243	You can get one that's more powerful than that.
1512503	1514565	You can dispose bodies in that thing.
1515706	1517086	Loki, it's $250.
1517587	1518467	No one's buying it.
1518487	1519368	I thought it was like $600.
1519428	1520329	I thought it was $600.
1520849	1521249	It used to be $600.
1521329	1524151	It could be a restaurant-caliber thing.
1524391	1525072	No, it used to be $600.
1525312	1525672	Now it's $399.
1525712	1527433	Just like the PS3.
1527613	1529575	But it can be yours for four low payments of $99.99.
1529655	1530575	Four low payments.
1530655	1532797	Just like the PS3 or the iPhone.
1532957	1533057	Yeah.
1534203	1539604	Nim in chat, chat.orangelandre.com if you're listening to us live on this Sunday evening says, Chuck Norris doesn't blend.
1539904	1541225	Chuck Norris blends blenders.
1542845	1544205	Let's not start this.
1544585	1545485	I'm sorry.
1545645	1546446	Yes, please let's not.
1547186	1548786	Let's move on to the next story quickly.
1549226	1557008	Anyways, speaking of blending, someone I'd love to throw into that wonderful high-powered blender.
1558832	1562835	Senator Hillary Clinton and of course some other folks.
1562855	1568660	The views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the station or other staff members of Orange Lingerie.
1568740	1571122	But they are the majority of the studio.
1571382	1588535	Anyways, Senator Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Sam Brownback, and even Bay, I guess, have sent letters to the ESRB asking for a thorough review of Manhunt 2 following the whole unlock
1589276	1591237	uh, content, do the hacking the game.
1593277	1601780	Uh, apparently they think because they're like political types that the ESRB would go, okie dokie, we didn't do our job the first time or something.
1602561	1618066	Um, and actually, the other thing that they're also wanting, um, done is because they're a little bit pissed off with the whole Wii controls and how you can murder people using the Wii remote, they want the Wii games to be rated differently because of such things like that.
1618792	1622714	So they want that taken into consideration for future ratings.
1623054	1625174	Because you know you can still aim a gun with a mouse.
1627255	1630877	Escapist in chat says, Sweet Jesus, is Manhunt 2 even selling that well?
1630937	1632037	My thoughts exactly.
1632197	1634578	No, I can tell you right now it's not.
1636219	1637679	Honestly, I don't understand the point of it.
1638039	1641461	I mean, doesn't fucking Hillary Clinton have better things to do?
1642721	1643041	No.
1643141	1643562	Seriously.
1644242	1647223	Well, I heard she's running for president.
1649076	1649376	I hope she wins!
1649396	1650798	I know, doesn't she have better things to do?
1652179	1653200	I really hope she wins.
1654941	1658985	Well, if I remember right, though, it's not just her, but she did band together with these other folks.
1659205	1660706	It's a multi-partisan thing.
1660726	1661527	Oh, well, it's four people then.
1661567	1666791	And I think this goes back to the fact that politicians generally are a little bit ignorant about this stuff.
1666811	1676640	See, this is what I don't understand is, you know, four letters from politicians and they want results, yet, you know, if I send them four letters to shut the fuck up, they're not going to do it either, so...
1677185	1678986	Why should they listen to them?
1680828	1683690	Well, maybe someone the ESRB should listen to is Mr. T!
1684050	1696358	Because goddammit, everybody should listen to Mr. T. And if that is true, then everybody will soon own a copy of World of Warcraft because there are brand new commercials featuring Mr. T and William Shatner for World of Warcraft.
1696619	1705305	And they're pretty... They're very interesting because, yeah, in the commercial, and I'm not going to play it because Blizzard isn't paying us to play it, but...
1706010	1713278	In the commercial, Mr. T talks about how he fantasizes himself as a night elf mohawk, even though there isn't actually a mohawk in the game.
1713698	1717142	And William Shatner is a shaman, a torn shaman.
1717362	1719224	Go figure, he's been nerfed to hell.
1721385	1724686	Apparently, Mini-Me has filmed a commercial as well.
1724766	1726727	You know, Vern Troyer has also filmed one.
1727487	1728628	I hope to God he's a gnome.
1728908	1731169	You better believe he's a gnome.
1731229	1732029	That's all I have to say.
1732049	1732709	I hope to God he's a gnome.
1732729	1735810	No, I think they're going to do the ironic thing where he's going to play a very tall character.
1735830	1736631	Make him a dry.
1738011	1739792	Lame.
1739852	1741272	I already got Shatner as a tauren.
1742313	1743993	Let's see here.
1744413	1748835	On a completely different note, Warcraft may be taking...
1749719	1751380	Warhawk Operation Omega Dawn
1779024	1781726	And there's going to be some nighttime base battles as well.
1782447	1787370	Few cliched titles.
1787670	1789771	Well, it's nice to see that they're expanding their games.
1790932	1791833	What few they have.
1793194	1793814	More power to them.
1793954	1794394	I agree.
1794475	1799798	There's a lot of dumb titles out there in video gaming, so titles aren't everything.
1800178	1802640	It's the gameplay that's going to be important in this expansion.
1803200	1804881	Of course, I never played the first Warhawk, so...
1806280	1806540	What?
1806740	1806980	What?
1807100	1807761	What did they say in chat room?
1807781	1808561	They're already subverting it.
1808721	1808881	Who?
1808901	1810242	They're already subverting the call name.
1810282	1810762	Who and what?
1810842	1811322	Chat room.
1811982	1813163	Who specifically and what?
1813283	1820966	We have Nim calling it Omega Dump, Sashiel Omega Dumb, Omega Dong, Omega Gong.
1821526	1822206	How mature.
1824587	1825448	Omega Penis.
1825568	1829149	Whoa, did we just make our first penis joke?
1830470	1831430	Probably not the last.
1832397	1839339	Speaking of jokes, the PlayStation 3 version of the Orange Box may be pretty hilarious.
1840479	1844600	Apparently... Thank you, Drew, for that very scary maniacal laughter.
1844640	1845641	What the hell was that?
1845961	1847021	That was my evil laugh.
1847141	1849322	That apparently was the evil... Wow.
1849362	1851622	That was the evil, I am laughing at you, PS3.
1851722	1853002	I'm a little scared about this.
1854463	1854803	Anyhow...
1855726	1862696	The Orange Box is actually, it's not being ported by Valve, who were doing the PC and 360 versions.
1863076	1867723	Apparently another team at EA has taken upon it to actually port this game over to the PlayStation 3.
1868404	1869846	And the early reports are saying...
1870606	1872367	Not that great.
1872587	1875169	Were they the team behind Superman Returns?
1875589	1876610	Oh God, I hope not.
1877870	1890678	Apparently there are a number of frame rate hiccups and other technical issues which, quote, at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable.
1891638	1898142	You know, what's interesting is if you think about other things you might have read about, Gabe Newell, who's one of the co-founders of Valve, he's
1898544	1899125	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1910451	1914753	The Orange Box is a pretty awesome game, going off what I've heard.
1914833	1917034	But Loki certainly said a lot of great things about Orange Box.
1917314	1918995	DarkSakura loves her some Portal.
1919035	1920675	She's gone freaking crazy with Portal.
1921155	1924877	I will be playing Orange Box this week, though, because Loki's Lomi is copy, so I'll let you know next week.
1925837	1930979	But whenever great games get disgraced like that, it makes us a little bit angsty.
1931479	1935181	And when we get angsty, the FU music comes in and we do our rants.
1950515	1952896	I'd actually like to start tonight because I'm reading chat.
1953496	1958017	I'm going to give an F you to Nim, who said, Omega, two girls, one cup.
1959197	1959937	Seriously.
1960797	1961358	Let it go.
1961378	1964038	Seriously, let it go on both ends of that.
1964398	1967859	I don't really have anything else to really say F you to, so I guess you get that.
1968039	1969900	F you to sleeping until one today.
1969920	1971280	That was pretty awesome.
1971600	1971900	Loki.
1972420	1975561	F you to being sick.
1975961	1979382	Stuffed up and all the other fun stuff that goes along with it.
1980523	1980643	F.U.
1980663	1980963	to Loki's SARS?
1981003	1981864	I hope it's not contagious.
2008379	2034874	FU to people in Battlefield 2 who insist I fly a helicopter even though I have no idea how to fly a helicopter FU to not having all these wonderful PC games that are coming out lately and FU to not being able to feed my WoW addiction Well you just need to have Tank upload a program for you to learn how to fly a combat helicopter Ooh, points for the Matrix reference Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the FUs of the week
2035595	2037416	Incredibly nerdy, thanks to Drew being here.
2037596	2038257	You know what's funny?
2038277	2041258	We're having that guy, Joe Pantalone, I think, coming in.
2041359	2042639	The guy that played Cypher.
2043940	2044761	He's coming into our work.
2044861	2045781	Oh, that guy.
2045801	2046281	He's that guy.
2046301	2050064	You don't really know his name, but in every mob movie, he plays a mob guy.
2050324	2053646	Or he plays... Or he... No.
2054667	2055747	I don't know what happened.
2055787	2057288	He was in... What was that movie?
2057328	2057808	Memento.
2058229	2059289	Yes, he was in Memento.
2059429	2065273	And Sopranos, and oddly enough, The Princess Diaries.
2066300	2067220	I don't wanna watch this again!
2091585	2092746	I still vote for the steak dinner.
2092766	2092966	So, yeah.
2115421	2116001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2136957	2137257	What?
2137757	2139098	Is that the actual company?
2139438	2141239	Okay, I'm sorry, but this is the actual company.
2141539	2145360	Developed by Champagne for the Ladies is the name.
2146320	2147881	Loki, this sounds right up your alley.
2147901	2148941	Champagne for the Ladies?
2149441	2151562	What kind of a fucking development team is that?
2152462	2156123	This sounds like the candy that strangers use to get people in their cars.
2156343	2157784	I mean, oh, but it gets better.
2158636	2160317	I got champagne for the ladies.
2160598	2165581	It replaces all the boyish drug running and random violence with stuff girls like.
2165722	2167263	Like experimenting with drugs.
2167643	2168944	Using sex... What?
2169865	2172467	Using sexuality for personal gain.
2172847	2176430	And clawing to the top of the social order by any means necessary.
2176830	2177731	Shut the fuck up.
2177791	2178791	Where is this from?
2178891	2179712	Is this for real?
2180012	2185076	Yeah, it's, um... You can gossip, shoplift... Shoplifting.
2185096	2185136	Uh...
2186517	2188738	Game, you know, all sorts of things like that.
2192119	2199521	Anyways, apparently, this being chat says, Grand Theft Auto, Ho Island.
2200782	2201682	Now that's degrading.
2202362	2202982	That's degrading.
2203182	2206023	Apparently, there's a report, though, on Canada.com.
2206183	2208844	Yes, they're so cool, they have their own .com.
2209944	2214826	They're writing that while the Australian Family Association deems the game toxic,
2215978	2222122	and Christine Devitt of the Montreal's Concordia University calls it corrosive.
2223002	2226104	That's not really a description for a game.
2226744	2228745	Insert blame Canada judge here.
2228865	2230906	That is the actual development name for the company.
2230926	2234148	The folks at Champagne for the Ladies say it's all in good fun.
2235109	2240892	First off, I'm sorry, but no one's going to take a company named Champagne for the Ladies seriously.
2241532	2243273	GS191 has an interesting point.
2243553	2245034	It's the Winona Riders Simulator.
2247189	2250711	This is more of like a Britney Spears simulator.
2251351	2253111	Drugs ruin your life and all that stuff.
2253191	2253872	My God.
2255952	2257053	But, like, I don't know.
2257133	2260694	Tell me if it's just me, but isn't there, like, a sick side of you that, like, kind of wants to play it?
2261214	2262114	I'll set it done.
2262455	2267876	Like, I'm kind of like... You know, it's like one of those things, like, I have to play it, like, before I die.
2268117	2268777	Hey, you know what?
2268837	2269357	Take two.
2269717	2271138	Pay attention to what they're doing in this game.
2271218	2275179	That way you can add a female character into Grand Theft Auto that you can play.
2275697	2276158	And there you go.
2276178	2277320	That's what women like.
2277380	2279763	Women like using sexuality for personal gain.
2279804	2280825	Pulling each other's hair.
2281606	2282708	And doing all stuff like that.
2283089	2284251	When Jamie's not here.
2285017	2285718	This is what happens.
2309980	2312542	Frisbee asks, what would Jamie's comments on this be?
2312983	2313703	I don't have a clue.
2313743	2315645	If we get her on the phone later, we'll have to watch.
2316025	2316746	I really don't know.
2318447	2321130	She would probably be making some sort of noise similar to this.
2325413	2326694	That's, I think, what Jamie would do.
2329557	2330197	Call me crazy.
2330598	2333660	Anyhow, let's get back into some real games.
2334481	2337824	Such as a real gamer girl, Lara Croft.
2338339	2340280	And I say that because Lara Croft has big boobs.
2341060	2341581	No, just kidding.
2342181	2346343	But of course, Lara Croft is much more of a hero than any of the characters in that other game ever will be.
2348837	2353960	has come out with Tomb Raider Anniversary on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
2354801	2357383	It's actually available for 1,200 Microsoft points.
2357423	2359024	That's going to set you back about 15 bucks.
2359324	2359964	Here's the thing, though.
2360004	2365428	You need to own Tomb Raider Legend in order to play it because it's technically downloadable content for that.
2365468	2368410	But if you want to download the Tomb Raider Anniversary, check that out.
2368510	2370331	It's available on the Xbox 360 right now.
2370951	2372532	Actually, I think that's only the first half of the game.
2373053	2374193	I think it's going to be two halves.
2374233	2375334	They're about 1,200 points each.
2375634	2375734	Ah.
2376535	2377255	Well, then there you have it.
2377896	2378276	But, uh,
2379384	2382305	If you don't like that, you can spend an extra $10 and buy the disc.
2383266	2386607	So, what's Lara Croft's equivalent of Horse Armor?
2386727	2392710	Or better yet, just wait a few months because this game isn't that great to begin with and wait for the drop in price.
2394211	2395872	Does download content drop in price that much?
2395952	2396452	I guess so.
2396472	2399453	I bought Carcassonne and it was free like four months later.
2399473	2402494	I'm talking about buying the disc version of the game.
2402835	2404535	Oh, I gotcha.
2405256	2407217	Speaking of Xbox Live stuff...
2408863	2419807	If you live in Europe, they're going to be offering you, instead of Halo 3 for buying an Xbox 360, 10 free Xbox Live Arcade games for new European Xbox 360 owners and a friend.
2421607	2422188	Let's see here.
2422708	2426029	Now, what you can do... Let's see.
2426089	2437353	If you buy a console between October 1st and December 14th, you fill out a form and then both you and a friend can get 10 free Xbox Live Arcade games.
2438033	2438293	And which...
2439076	2440577	To be honest, aren't that bad.
2441198	2459935	It's a pretty good selection, including Every Extent Extra Extreme, Sonic the Hedgehog, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting, Bomberman Live, Marble Blast Ultra, Spyglass Board Games, Small Arms, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures, Assault Heroes, and Zuma Deluxe.
2460476	2461216	But hey, it's free.
2461296	2461817	It's not bad.
2462605	2463166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2475817	2479058	Also, let's get into some release dates and talk about Europe first.
2479139	2482680	Jamie's not here, but I've got you covered on what is coming out in Europe.
2482700	2488623	And I imagine now that the holidays are over, things are slowing down in terms of release dates, but apparently not.
2488963	2492244	There's still a lot of stuff coming out on the 30th over in Europe.
2492284	2500308	We have a port of Alvin and the Chipmunks, which is that, I'm sure, a translation of that, I'm sure, Oscar award-winning movie.
2500328	2501148	It's a music game.
2501708	2502749	Is it a music game for real?
2502769	2505190	It's not karaoke, though, but it's a rhythm music game.
2505618	2511859	Yeah, but... You know, there's rhythm music games that are good, like DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero.
2512159	2513780	Then there's these types of music games.
2513800	2514660	This isn't going to be one of them.
2514760	2515220	Yeah, exactly.
2515820	2519141	Alvin and Chipmunks comes out on the 30th on the DS and the Wii.
2519181	2523462	BlackSci Area 51 makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360, also on the 30th.
2524042	2527422	Boogie finally makes its way to Europe on PlayStation 2 and the DS this week.
2527802	2529223	Cruisin' comes out on the Wii.
2529283	2530243	I'm sure you can skip that.
2530683	2536613	Football Manager for the PSP comes out as well as Guitar Hero 3 comes out on the PC this week.
2536713	2544627	I believe it already came out on the consoles last week because I've seen, yeah, it must have come out last week because I saw some British folks joining the OL Army.
2545683	2547744	Jenga comes out on the DS on the 30th.
2548184	2551085	Medal of Honor for the PSP also comes out on the 30th.
2551745	2554926	Pro Evo Soccer 2008 for the PSP also on the 30th.
2555286	2557167	Puzzle Quest comes out on the PlayStation 2.
2557967	2560728	Resident Evil The Umbrella Chronicles on the Wii.
2560828	2562389	Speedball 2 on the PC.
2562509	2564049	Syphon Filter on the PSP.
2564469	2567090	The Golden Compass on damn near every system.
2567650	2569831	Again, another kind of gaming port of a movie.
2570391	2575073	And lastly, but certainly not leastly, My Horse and Me on the PC.
2575902	2577443	Developed by Atari.
2577923	2580085	And you wonder why their CEO recently left the company.
2602926	2604967	Oh my god, and it's fucking full-priced?
2605947	2608428	We just stole $34 out of your wallet.
2608448	2609288	It's magic!
2609908	2613849	Well, if you're buying it from GameStop, it's full-priced, but it's supposed to be $20.
2613909	2615549	Two words.
2615909	2617130	Ping pals.
2617330	2625952	Cranium Kabuki, if you like that trivia game, normally a board game, you can buy that from Ubisoft on the Wii.
2627107	2629328	Boogie is coming out in the DS this week.
2629529	2632130	Also, Geometry Wars Galaxies on the DS.
2632910	2635412	History Channel Battle for the Pacific on the Wii.
2637273	2638573	And let's see.
2640594	2644436	And Indoor Sports from Konami, although that's not coming out.
2644476	2645597	That's next year.
2648438	2653721	Well, they list it as because we have some more current dates than they do.
2655382	2655702	That's it.
2656249	2660831	It's really... I imagine it's probably a much slower week here, thanks to Black Friday being over.
2662211	2664572	Did anybody actually venture out on Black Friday?
2665812	2668073	I did, like, later on in the evening.
2668253	2672875	I went to GameStop around 2 to pick up the Wings of the Goddess, and it wasn't that bad.
2673615	2675876	They were adequately staffed, I'll tell you that.
2675896	2677496	They had, like, people walking the floor and everything.
2677656	2681558	I went and bought Zola and the Zapper.
2681578	2682498	You know what's weird, though?
2682518	2682838	Hmm?
2683440	2687603	The Zapper, from what we've, you know, the press release said it was supposed to be $20.
2688444	2693347	And, you know, my company, we're selling it at $20 retail.
2694168	2695349	GameStop's selling it for $25.
2696409	2697130	Oh, ho, ho.
2697710	2698031	Everywhere.
2698051	2699552	Interesting.
2699932	2700973	Shop around for the best deal?
2701193	2702994	No, I spent $25 because I'm lazy.
2704435	2706537	I don't know, it's wasted $25 right there.
2707217	2708498	But, you know, we'll get into that later.
2708885	2710846	Alright, let's get into some Japanese release dates.
2710886	2717108	Assassin's Creed comes out in Japan, the localized version for the Xbox 360 from Ubisoft.
2718669	2721710	Apocalypse Desire Next is a new game on the Xbox 360.
2722070	2726392	It is a strategy-based game, and it doesn't look like anything we have over here.
2727333	2729354	Just trying to take a look at some screenshots real quick.
2729814	2733275	Looks like it might be a tactical type of game.
2734616	2735236	Trying to look here.
2735666	2739047	Oh yeah, it's definitely more of a tactical-based type of game, so check that out.
2739487	2741608	If you like those games, Apocalypse Desire next.
2741668	2745149	Also coming out this week in Japan on the Wii, Swing Golf!
2745809	2752911	Panjia Second Shot is coming out, which I'm sure is just kind of Nintendo's version of Hot Shots Golf, or who are we trying to kid?
2752951	2755032	It's just another rip-off of a Wii sports title.
2755732	2761694	Also coming out on the Wii, Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes on the Wii, coming out from Capcom.
2762628	2766291	Also coming out in Japan, Tony Hawk's Project 8 on the PlayStation 3.
2767752	2772976	Star Train, Your Past Makes Your Future on the PlayStation 2 from Princess Soft.
2774117	2779161	And you can get a limited edition of that game as well if you follow every Princess Soft title.
2779641	2787067	Speaking of princesses on the Nintendo DS, Disney Princesses Magical Jewels comes out in Japan.
2788868	2791450	I don't know exactly what their magical jewels are, but I don't want to find out.
2791874	2794575	Cats 2 comes out of the Nintendo DS in Japan.
2794995	2796475	Another cat simulation game.
2797075	2802557	Because apparently Cats 1 with a Z, that's Cats with a Z, was so popular there is now a Cats 2.
2803837	2809278	Fukumori, Mori No Unhappy Project is coming out from Bandai, also on the Nintendo DS.
2809938	2812619	And I have no idea what this game's all about.
2812739	2815820	Looks like it could be another mix of minigames.
2816600	2817960	It's hard to tell from the screenshots.
2818020	2819041	It's an action-based game.
2819841	2821001	Probably a typical platformer.
2821397	2822197	What's so damn funny?
2822478	2822978	Is it chat?
2823438	2823918	It's chat.
2823958	2825439	What are they saying in chat, Drew?
2826279	2827580	Oh, typical DMN.
2827940	2828741	Princess off.
2828781	2829941	Doesn't Rob work for them?
2830101	2831562	Ha ha ha, funny.
2832623	2836244	Coming out on the PSP, Disgaea Hour of Darkness Portable.
2836525	2840006	Coming out, the portable version of the popular strategy game.
2840026	2842147	That's going to do it for Japanese release dates.
2842968	2843228	Awesome.
2844096	2856708	Anyways, one thing that's supposedly coming soon to the Wii, which is weird because I never thought it would, but the Unreal 3 engine is apparently being adapted for the Wii by some unnamed company.
2857489	2861072	They're porting it over much like I guess they did with the Unreal 2 engine.
2862333	2865196	Oh, Ubisoft ported over the Unreal 2 engine for Red Steel.
2867804	2868444	Hmm.
2868464	2871086	So is it coming over for Red Steel 2, maybe?
2871667	2872307	Uh, I don't know.
2872387	2874509	Because isn't the rumor that that game is supposed to be being made?
2875550	2875970	It is.
2876190	2877711	Hopefully it doesn't suck as much as the first one.
2877731	2878992	Yeah, maybe they can make it right this time.
2879753	2880033	Hmm.
2880834	2881294	I don't know.
2881675	2885417	You know, you've heard my opinion on Ubisoft ports for Wii.
2885578	2885658	Uh...
2890188	2891350	I try to stay away from them.
2891390	2892832	But we don't know for sure it's them.
2892912	2898721	It's an unnamed company that's doing it, but it's just kind of one of those, you know, if you were betting, odds would favor this.
2898761	2903889	You know, I think they could probably do it if they, you know, did something like Cell Shaded or something like that.
2903949	2906092	Very simple, like, you know, Wind Waker type graphics.
2906545	2907706	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2932341	2937863	Then they can sell that to other companies, you know, to make Wii versions of stuff using the Unreal 3 engine.
2938183	2946287	And plus, you know, with just the Wii selling as crazy as it is, you know, if you've probably seen the stories on Black Friday, people are still going crazy about the Nintendo Wii.
2946947	2949348	And it's, you know, it's kind of a different demographic.
2949388	2952849	You know, the more family household, quote unquote, is where the Nintendo Wiis are going.
2953270	2961553	So certainly if there is a particular game that they want to try and get a piece of that audience with that type of, you know, share the marketplace, they'll go for it.
2963214	2970598	Anyhow, let's take this opportunity to dive into the mailbag and take a look at some of the emails that we've gotten this week.
2971238	2974119	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
2974219	2981303	DarkSakura will usually take on these responsibilities, but since she's not here, I stole the password to the mailbag and I'm looking in her place.
2986665	2988446	Let's look at email number one tonight.
2989306	2990587	Four emails we're reading tonight.
2991007	2992548	Email number one comes to us from
2993286	2996627	Arvid, who didn't use a handle, so I called him by his real name.
2996727	2997948	Arvid said, Greetings!
2998508	2999328	Just a quick question.
2999368	3003069	What is the song called that you play at the end of the show, and from what game is it?
3003590	3005590	Sorry if this has already been answered in the forums.
3005690	3010372	The song at the end of the program that you will hear in a little while when we finish.
3010392	3014333	That's iFutureList by Akira Yamaoka, which I believe appeared in DDR...
3021549	3024751	Supernova in the US for a console game.
3024971	3026732	I thought it was Extreme 2 also.
3027072	3027792	Was it in Extreme 2?
3027952	3029233	I thought it was Supernova.
3029713	3033955	And I'm sure one of the Bombani nerds in chat knows for sure, but it made its first appearance in one of the 2DX games.
3034436	3037817	I want to say 2DX 13th?
3039478	3039998	I don't remember.
3040058	3041699	I stopped tracking after 8th.
3042520	3043900	It shows up in various Bombani games.
3045461	3049223	Let's go to the next email coming to us from Charred.
3050256	3052018	Also known as Rick, the UK fanboy.
3052439	3054441	Hey guys, do you have a postage address?
3054621	3058025	We're going through a mass tidy at our house and I have to throw out a lot of my stuff.
3058405	3060668	I've come across some things that might be fun to send you.
3060708	3061649	A Christmas present maybe.
3062089	3063571	Oh, maybe I'll... I like presents.
3064072	3064752	I like presents.
3064832	3069698	As long as it's not a B-O-M-B, then I guess I'm okay with giving out the address.
3070198	3070679	So we'll see.
3071552	3074934	Uh, yeah, sure, I'll reply to that and find out, but there's another part of this.
3075634	3076975	I wouldn't have read this on air if that was it.
3077035	3077935	There is another part of this.
3078316	3079476	Anyway, I also have a question.
3079976	3084419	Which game were you so excited to get, and when it came out was the biggest disappointment?
3084839	3090862	If you could go back in time and hit the developer over the head with a big comedy inflatable hammer, what would you get them to change?
3091542	3095444	Cheerio, Govna, Chimney, Cup of Tea, Telly, and all that stuff.
3098286	3100747	Well, he is our UK fanboy, so... You forgot Crumpets!
3101288	3101788	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3126089	3127450	Guilty Gear Dust Strikers DS Game
3156305	3157246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3179810	3186792	But they screwed up the fighting system, they screwed up the plot, and they made a joke of a last boss.
3188552	3189873	Easy, easy, easy for me.
3189913	3194054	The game that was the biggest disappointment where I wanted to go back and smack the developers upside the head, Nintendogs.
3194754	3195194	Remember E3?
3195214	3197235	I freaking fell in love with this game.
3197295	3201256	I said it's going to be the greatest game that comes out this year, and then when the game comes out, I was bored with it in an hour.
3201576	3201816	Woof.
3202438	3206659	I know, because there was nothing really else to do besides those three contests.
3206939	3211880	There wasn't a lot of competitive stuff, and there wasn't much you could do with the dogs.
3211920	3215361	Yes, I realized it was supposed to be a sim, but I don't know.
3216501	3219742	I was thinking there would be more of a game to it, and there wasn't, and that was kind of sad.
3220082	3221362	How about We Connect 24?
3222422	3223302	Does that count as a game?
3223482	3223862	Kind of.
3224282	3226783	Animal Crossing DS would be a close second for me, honestly.
3228161	3234543	I was expecting so much more from that, and I think it felt more like a port than a sequel, and that was what was ultimately disappointing.
3235283	3235823	So there you have it.
3236143	3247427	Yeah, and the other disappointing thing about Nintendogs is the fact that it's been selling like crazy, and now we have all of these knockoff games to thank, such as like Cats 2, which I think we said earlier, Imagine Babies, all those stuff.
3247527	3257830	Did you see they had, what was it, a bundle, I think, through, I want to see maybe, it was like one of the big retail chains.
3258171	3263654	But it was the Nintendogs, like that metallic red or rose DS.
3264034	3267095	And then two or three other versions of Nintendogs.
3267115	3268936	You get like four of the same game.
3269436	3269757	Nice.
3271317	3271798	Very nice.
3272538	3276040	DMNourishment said it was designed to be played like 15 minutes a day, Rob.
3276060	3276560	What do you want?
3276920	3278941	Yeah, and then it got boring after two days.
3279581	3280542	I mean, that was the problem.
3280582	3282023	There was not a lot to come back for.
3282183	3284764	There wasn't a lot to kind of like earn or work towards in that game.
3284784	3286165	It's a freaking Tamagotchi.
3286605	3287025	Kind of.
3287446	3288467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3309611	3313072	I don't see how this is actually related to games, but that's how it is spun.
3313452	3316013	If you ask me, the violent act was done solely for money.
3316353	3322576	The fact that it was for four pounds sterling doesn't make it more tragic because the kid didn't know how much she had.
3322936	3330178	So in other words, he's sending us a link to the story about how, you know, let's see, boy murders old woman for game money.
3330438	3332399	Oh, and this is a story that was dug and everything.
3332830	3338832	It was a 13-year-old kid in Vietnam robbed an 81-year-old woman, and he used the money to play online games.
3339332	3339693	I see.
3340453	3343794	And obviously where Rob's kind of going is that, isn't this really about a robbery?
3343854	3345275	Why does it necessarily have to be about games?
3345295	3346375	Who cares what they spent it on?
3346735	3347716	It wasn't me, I swear.
3348576	3351297	I mean, but if he spent it on crack, it wouldn't have made the news.
3351417	3357339	You know, it's sad that that woman got robbed, but we really want to know, what did he spend the money on?
3357419	3359340	Let's get in the mind of this criminal.
3360097	3361298	How did he spend that money?
3361398	3365859	And then let's prove that gamers are completely worthless moral rejects.
3366100	3378865	I love this, too, is that the story makes reference to the story from earlier this month when that kid beat up his mom over Halo 3 when she tried to take it away from him, like call the cops, that whole thing we read on a previous show.
3380185	3381366	They remind folks of that.
3381826	3384347	Yeah, let's just call it bad parenting and leave it at that.
3384367	3386068	That's your Jamie angle, I imagine.
3388254	3388854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3417563	3421485	My PS3 is being borrowed by a friend who likes Ratchet & Clank a lot more than I do.
3422225	3422505	Nice.
3422846	3425247	And he's playing it, and he loves the game.
3425467	3429509	So that's a no, but... To be honest, I don't even think I want to play the game.
3429749	3430930	It looks fun.
3430950	3431770	It looks like Ratchet & Clank.
3431790	3432310	Why'd you buy it?
3433231	3435412	Because I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order.
3435892	3438893	I just said, fuck it, I'm going to pick it up because it's supposed to be a good game.
3439314	3439974	You tool.
3440914	3441595	It looks good.
3441815	3443936	It looks fun, but no, it's just...
3444807	3447910	I didn't play any of the Ratchet & Clank games, and there's probably a reason for that.
3447930	3449051	It's because I didn't want to play them.
3449331	3451072	And why the fuck did I buy the new one?
3451232	3454715	I know, because I'm desperate for good games for the PS3.
3455175	3456757	And which you don't play.
3457457	3467325	Well, now I'm loaning it to a friend right now, because he's going to get his own PS3 soon, and probably when he does that, I'm probably going to sell him the game, so... Ranma says, Damn, Loki, you're sad.
3467926	3471348	Dartitsuya says, Loki, do you think Mario Galaxy ripped them off, as they claim?
3471809	3472049	No.
3473130	3473350	Alright.
3473775	3475456	More of the email from Marissimo here.
3475836	3479938	Also, have you guys tried Super Stardust HD or any other PSN titles?
3480338	3485860	I think that even though the selection is pretty slim, most of the games are worth trying, especially if you've got a Japanese account.
3486480	3488481	GT Prologue looks fucking amazing.
3488881	3491682	Thanks for consistently putting on such great shows.
3491762	3492483	We appreciate it.
3492883	3493083	Thank you.
3493103	3501346	I do have a Japanese account, and I do play GT Prologue, and I still don't like Gran Turismo, no matter how pretty they make it, but that's just my personal preference.
3502307	3502827	It looks pretty.
3503294	3505336	I wouldn't say it's any better than Project Gotham Racing 3.
3508619	3508959	I don't know.
3510440	3517546	When you get the cars looking that good, it's not like leaps and bounds better than anything that's out there right now.
3519728	3520589	I do have Flow.
3520889	3521469	Flow's fun.
3522650	3530917	Personally, the only thing that's really stopping me from buying games on the PlayStation Network is I hate their fucking account system where you have to put money on this account and then
3532025	3538170	Yeah, but even with Xbox Live Marketplace, you get a little bit of that, where you always have some points left over, you know?
3538190	3540651	Yeah, but at least there's stuff I can download on there.
3540671	3547456	I mean, and also a lot of the download stuff that they have on the PlayStation Network is a little bit more expensive.
3561241	3563863	or like less production value or whatever.
3563943	3568126	I know there's good stuff on there like Everyday Shooter and some of the stuff like that.
3568246	3571808	But there's nothing really that's jumped out at me other than Flow.
3571828	3572529	Flow is kind of fun.
3572709	3573529	But I don't know.
3573810	3574090	All right.
3575131	3576031	All right.
3576051	3576972	Well, that's it for the mailbag.
3577152	3580634	So again, if you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
3583016	3583296	All right.
3583676	3585978	Anyways, on to some other stuff.
3587201	3591122	Of course, it's no surprise that Super Mario Galaxy is selling well.
3592542	3595823	It has sold 500,000 copies in the U.S.
3596243	3599264	in the first week alone, which is pretty awesome.
3601225	3605926	And of course, it's probably going to be continuing to sell well all throughout the holidays.
3605946	3610827	We also know that it sold 250,000 units in Japan in its first week as well, so.
3611991	3612471	HALO 3 HALO 3
3630802	3632643	Teetered off, like, really quick, I think.
3632844	3634565	Well, I mean, it had a huge launch.
3635025	3636627	And, you know, everybody that had Halo 2.
3636927	3639809	It's kind of like, earlier in the show, I was talking about the whole MMO thing.
3639909	3643792	I mean, in a way, it's kind of similar with fans, you know, hardcore fans of a series.
3644193	3646214	Everybody's going to be out there day one buying it.
3646474	3651558	Can you imagine if Halo 3's multiplayer servers had gone down going, oh, sorry, we didn't think so many people would try to get on.
3652079	3654380	Which is basically what, you know, Squeenix did with Final Fantasy.
3654781	3657143	Well, the difference is there's a single player element to Halo.
3659545	3660045	I guess that's true.
3660854	3661757	Alright, well, anyhow.
3661777	3663984	Oh, you can play single player in Final Fantasy XI.
3666639	3667279	That's funny.
3667479	3670562	There's a new device out there called the Cyber Famulator.
3671082	3674105	It allows you to play your Famicom games on your DS Lite.
3674485	3677328	Also with this device, you can use a TV Out.
3677708	3680711	Now, keep in mind that is a Famicom emulator.
3680851	3681692	It's not actually an emulator.
3681712	3682532	It's an actual device.
3682552	3685635	You put your DS on top of it and it does this whole thing.
3685695	3691040	So keep in mind it's Japanese, so you can't use it for NES games.
3692270	3694992	But just out of curiosity, is this something you guys would want?
3696612	3698813	Would you want it like it is now to play Japanese imports?
3698873	3703796	Or do you think it might be kind of cool to have something to use your old school NES cartridges on?
3704416	3705136	It looks kind of cool.
3705156	3707657	It looks like almost the DS version of the Super 8.
3707837	3709758	I'd get it just for nostalgia's sake.
3710699	3713760	I wish there was more you could do with it, kind of like with the Super Game Boy and stuff.
3713780	3715641	Like you could change the colors and all that dumb shit.
3715941	3717642	It would be cool if you could like, I don't know,
3717950	3718651	DMN Fuck Your Warranty FYI
3738646	3742348	That's a good point, if you're going to get something like this, and then some people still have warranties.
3742368	3743689	Why would it fuck your warranty?
3743729	3747891	I think it's something you have to attach there with... No, it just plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot.
3748131	3748391	Yeah.
3749512	3752153	That's why it's only on one screen, because it's plugging into the Game Boy Advance slot.
3752173	3753914	You probably could fucking use it on a Game Boy Advance.
3754215	3754435	Hmm.
3754815	3756896	But, you know... Oh, it's for the DS, I'm sorry.
3757516	3757957	Interesting.
3758077	3761939	But yeah, it's not like something you have to mod your system for, that'd be stupid.
3761959	3762459	Alright.
3762759	3763099	But anyways.
3764520	3765861	Anyways, let's see here.
3766548	3770451	There's actually been a series that just started on TV, and I gotta mention this.
3771212	3773654	The Discovery Channel's Rise of the Video Game.
3774074	3774695	It's actually pretty good.
3774715	3775936	I watched the first episode of it.
3775956	3779799	It reminds me if you've ever watched G4's Icon series that they have.
3780420	3785284	Very similar to that kind of thing, but it's, you know, kind of the whole history of video games.
3785344	3791829	And they just started with, like, you know, the very first computer game to, you know, the 70s, like Pac-Man and
3792341	3793522	and stuff like that.
3793902	3794742	Yeah, exactly.
3794962	3796943	And a really fascinating series.
3797123	3803467	I mean, they're going to replay the hell out of this all throughout the week, so I recommend catching it on TV or YouTube.
3803847	3808709	DMM would like to remind you that any third-party thingamajig not licensed fucks your warranty, apparently.
3811170	3814752	You mean I avoided my warranty by using a game gene in my NES?
3815072	3817654	How would they prove that you fucked it up by plugging it in there?
3817834	3820275	If there's no physical evidence, they're not going to be like...
3820774	3822936	Hmm, I sense residue from this thing.
3822996	3824598	I mean, they're not fucking CSI.
3824979	3826480	There's a lot of dust on this.
3826560	3828602	If you go, my DS broke, you know, fix it.
3828843	3829663	They're just going to do it.
3829864	3832767	They're not going to be able to tell unless you actually broke it open.
3832967	3833888	You'll never know.
3834669	3835249	They're not CSI.
3835269	3836571	They don't have the snappy one-liners.
3838613	3838913	All right.
3839934	3840295	Let's go...
3842076	3845017	Wait, I actually want to ask real quick about the rise of the video game.
3845057	3846238	Is that something you actually watched?
3846278	3846718	Yeah, I did.
3847319	3847699	It was good.
3848019	3849940	What was the format of it?
3849960	3851561	Because I forgot to TiVo it.
3851761	3855222	It's basically a reminder, like I said, of the Icon series.
3855262	3864167	They kind of discuss different things that went on, and then they would have developers and major key figures and stuff commenting on it.
3864207	3867929	They had the president of IGN, they had some of the...
3869642	3894348	The creator of Pac-Man and stuff And they were talking about all the phenomenon, the pop culture stuff Related with video games And just the mentality and all that stuff They went and talked about Tetris It's just very well done It's a really cool series I think it's worth checking out The last documentary I watched on games was that PBS one That was in high def, it was kind of neat
3895103	3897812	I mean, this, like I said, I love the Icon series.
3897832	3901985	That was probably my favorite show on G4, but, you know...
3903524	3904404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3940859	3945263	Alright, this week's classic game of the week is a game called Equinox.
3945283	3946885	It's the classic game of the week.
3947365	3952310	Equinox was actually the sequel to another game on the NES called Solstice 2.
3952831	3955734	I don't know, I'm sorry, Solstice was the game on NES.
3956054	3958797	This was kind of Solstice 2 in many ways.
3959237	3964222	And part of the reason I like totally dig this game is the fact that it was kind of like...
3965080	3967322	I love the ambience and the music in this game.
3967382	3968763	It really set the mood.
3968823	3973246	Basically, you have this isometric view of the game.
3973927	3976388	If you haven't played Solstice on the NES, it was very similar.
3977930	3979911	You had this isometric view of the game.
3981512	3985555	You were going through these dungeons and trying to solve all these different puzzles in the game.
3987677	3990620	The ambience that the music set was just, like, awesome.
3990660	3995665	And you got these different items, and you had to fight the bosses, and it had, like, really cool boss music in the game.
3996506	4003032	And I think, ironically, one of the things that was really cool about Equinox was that it was actually developed by Sony.
4004114	4008418	One of the Sony spin-offs companies, Sony ImagineSoft, was actually the company that made this game.
4008718	4011381	So it was kind of like Sony making a game for the Super Nintendo.
4012782	4012942	Equinox
4030621	4032963	It required a hell of a lot of patience.
4033023	4036065	It had kind of a steep learning curve, but it was a little fun once you got used to it.
4036125	4036365	It did.
4036605	4039947	It had a real steep learning curve to it, and it was fucking hard.
4039987	4047572	The other thing about it is that it had a really precise way to kind of get through the game, and it was not very forgiving in regards to running into people and stuff.
4047893	4049173	You pop up on the overworld.
4049193	4055578	I don't know if it's maybe the YouTube guy playing it on an emulator or something, but why the fuck is all the text in front of... Because it's a demo.
4055798	4056678	You're looking at a demo.
4057059	4057139	Oh.
4057459	4057579	So...
4058078	4060439	You pop up on the overworld and within two minutes you're dead.
4061020	4061880	Yeah, it's tough.
4062161	4062421	It's tough.
4062441	4063762	Yeah, there were little bosses around the overworld.
4063782	4066083	You know this game was actually originally developed to be an RPG.
4066123	4072227	If you actually look on YouTube, you can find YouTube clips of this game as like an RPG.
4072887	4075469	You can actually see like text that was cut from the game.
4075929	4077730	So, kind of interesting the way it's set up.
4078277	4078978	So there you have it.
4079519	4086429	And being asked in chat room, DMN under the guys, your mom, says, Rob, will this be on virtual console?
4086449	4088352	And I say, Lordy, I hope so.
4089294	4089754	I hope so.
4090355	4093340	So, Loki, you'll be bringing in a classic game next week in Jamie's absence, correct?
4093360	4093580	Yeah.
4093760	4094001	All right.
4094631	4096572	All right, well, this is the part of the show then.
4096752	4097812	It is a short show tonight.
4097852	4101514	We want to cram it all into one segment, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype lines.
4101834	4108656	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
4109137	4110697	And folks have been hammering the phones already.
4110737	4112918	I believe we already have a call on the line.
4113298	4114099	Caller, are you there?
4115099	4115739	Hi, Rob.
4116179	4116680	Hi.
4116740	4117480	Is this Jamie?
4118340	4118860	Yes, it is.
4119040	4119641	Hi, Jamie.
4119681	4120101	How are you?
4121731	4123152	I'm looking at the rain right now.
4123773	4124833	Is it raining where you're at?
4125714	4126695	Oh yeah, it's raining.
4127035	4127495	Of course.
4127855	4130717	So I'm sure... I am... I'm sorry, I know you're... Oh, go ahead.
4130737	4133139	I was just saying, I'm calling from Alabama.
4133479	4134800	Well, how has things been going out there?
4134820	4135580	How was your Thanksgiving?
4137081	4143465	We had it yesterday, and Mom cooked for a small army, but thankfully a small army showed up, and then they went off to kick butt for me.
4144486	4144706	Nice.
4144726	4147228	And it was pretty cool, and...
4147930	4148391	DarkSakura.com
4166610	4167050	Yeah, that movie's cool.
4167070	4169531	Hypercube and Cube Zero, which I'm supposed to be watching while I'm here.
4187816	4188357	and DarkSakura.com.
4200362	4201902	Not much else, you know.
4201982	4205403	I almost logged into Ragnarok once at this Wi-Fi place that we found.
4206384	4206844	Very cool.
4206964	4207944	To check my vending.
4208024	4209044	And I didn't.
4209064	4209884	I resisted the urge.
4210345	4216066	If I sounded a little distracted during the Classic Game of the Week segment, that's because I was actually trying to pick up Jamie's call.
4216626	4218707	But I was curious, did you hear the Classic Game of the Week segment?
4218907	4220207	Did I pick a worthy game this week?
4221112	4222473	Did you say you picked Psychonauts?
4222733	4228416	No, it was Equinox, which was Solstice 2 on the Super Nintendo, basically.
4228876	4231958	I was like, that wasn't on Super Nintendo.
4233299	4234399	No, no, Equinox.
4235600	4236240	Huh?
4236360	4239602	Equinox, which was much, well, I like Psychonauts 2.
4239802	4242063	I can't say it's much cooler, but it was a very cool game, so.
4243104	4243304	Yeah.
4243493	4246655	I was just curious if I picked a worthy game this week.
4247475	4248156	I'd say you did.
4248176	4248916	That's a pretty good one.
4249236	4250517	Awesome.
4251017	4252638	You gave my stamp of approval.
4253519	4254159	Good, good.
4254219	4255080	I'm always looking for that.
4256481	4260923	Loki, tell Jamie a little bit about the story we covered earlier in the evening.
4261283	4264985	There's apparently a girl Grand Theft Auto type of game coming out.
4265045	4266526	And Loki, what is it you can do in this game?
4267027	4268407	You can do drugs.
4268888	4272770	You can also have sex with people for your own personal gain.
4274047	4276088	Spread Rumors, stuff like that.
4276649	4278790	Does this sound like the female Grand Theft Auto to you?
4278990	4280330	Doing drugs and pulling people's hair?
4281871	4282592	Um, no.
4282892	4289575	See, my perfect version would be like this hardcore chick with like an... We actually just got done watching Planet Terror, so it would be Rose McGowan.
4289975	4294237	Oh, and it's developed by a company called Champagne for the Ladies.
4295138	4296078	That's so stupid.
4297679	4301521	What about... Wait, who would be cooler, Rose McGowan or Tank Girl?
4303070	4303910	Oh, that's a hard one.
4305131	4306431	That's a hard, hard one.
4307852	4310493	I don't know, Tank Girl's pretty hardcore, but she has to have the tank.
4311013	4311413	That's true.
4313234	4315675	I think they should just make a Tank Girl video game, honestly.
4315975	4316816	That would be great.
4316956	4318616	They were going to, and it got cancelled.
4319257	4319537	Don't!
4319637	4320997	Of course, Stuart has to do all the artwork.
4321017	4322198	On the original PlayStation.
4322698	4322778	Ah.
4324065	4326407	I've already been challenged by a Wii Zapper.
4326447	4327408	It fell on my foot before I left.
4327448	4328689	We're actually watching Eddie Izzard right now.
4328709	4329990	Well, then go enjoy the Eddie Izzard.
4349689	4350390	Alright, take care.
4351150	4351971	Bye everybody.
4352491	4352611	Bye.
4352631	4354212	We'll see you when we get back in two weeks.
4354753	4355033	Bye-bye.
4356514	4360216	Jamie was very patient waiting on hold while I was doing the classic game of the week, so I appreciate that.
4360697	4362338	Alright, let's go to the phones again.
4362418	4367101	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you can call or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
4367121	4368282	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4368302	4368642	Who's this?
4369422	4370503	It's Raven Stolfen.
4370543	4371564	Hello, Raven Stolfen.
4371584	4372004	How are you?
4372985	4373825	I am okay.
4373845	4374926	A little cramped in here.
4375266	4375927	A little cramped?
4376967	4378148	Yeah, my house is being renovated.
4378706	4379887	Don't you have control over it?
4379927	4381048	Can't you just say, Hey!
4381088	4381688	No more orange boxes!
4408607	4412390	I tried, and then they go like, no, we gotta play Portal.
4412410	4413050	Portal's awesome!
4413070	4415012	And then they're like, Team Fortress is awesome.
4415672	4417854	And then I'm like, you haven't played it very much.
4417934	4419635	It's like, yeah, it's very hardcore.
4419775	4420896	Yeah, it's very hardcore!
4421557	4423038	Offer them a cake if they shut up.
4423558	4429022	Wait, now, so did you just call in tonight to bitch about your own show's politics, or what's the deal?
4429042	4430383	No, no, not at all.
4430604	4432005	Alright, what else is up?
4433045	4434967	You talked about Portal and all those games.
4435754	4436174	I guess it's true.
4436194	4437555	I haven't really played them still yet.
4437575	4439575	I'm like the least coolest kid on the block.
4439595	4440315	So you're just like me.
4440575	4441296	Okay.
4441336	4442196	Now you're in the same boat.
4442356	4445937	Well, except Loki, one of the cool kids on the block, is loaning me his copy.
4445977	4452278	So maybe by next week I'll be sitting here giggling going, hee hee, the cake is alive, hee hee hee, you know, and all that stuff that everybody else is doing.
4452399	4454019	So we'll see.
4455039	4458740	Do you think, does this kind of stuff kind of irritate you when people go too far?
4458760	4459360	It pisses me off.
4459801	4460061	Really?
4460821	4461161	I'm sorry.
4461181	4464582	It pisses me off, especially when a commercial that goes the greatest game of all time.
4464602	4465182	Mm-hmm.
4466631	4471693	And with the PlayStation 3 version being very unplayable, Gabe Newell must really hate that thing.
4473433	4477555	Apparently there's not a lot of nice things to say about it from Valve.
4478535	4478955	I love it.
4479775	4482076	Technically it's like, I hate the PlayStation 3.
4482176	4483036	I'm just going to gimp it.
4485317	4486758	Apparently a lot of folks are doing that.
4488578	4490879	Alright, well, any final thoughts for our listeners, RavensDolphin?
4492459	4494300	No, but don't be in a cramped room.
4494793	4495433	ZENICOR ZENICOR ZENICOR
4525727	4527128	Same old stuff, different day, man.
4527408	4527849	Gotcha.
4528509	4529670	What's your gaming week been like?
4529930	4531331	Actually, first off, did you have a good Thanksgiving?
4532772	4534454	Yeah, I got turkey for days, dude.
4534754	4535014	Awesome.
4535594	4536135	Leftovers.
4536175	4538116	Turkey and then turkey everything for a whole week.
4539477	4542279	Nothing but turkey and sleeping for the next half week or so.
4542559	4543000	Gotcha.
4543440	4544181	So how was your gaming week?
4544201	4545321	What do we owe the call to tonight?
4546382	4549625	Well, I've been getting all of my November 20th gaming out of the way.
4549685	4552647	So I finally managed to finish Assassin's Creed and saw the...
4553240	4553300	O.M.G.
4553320	4553520	Spoilers!
4572754	4574334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4600891	4603293	It sounds like they already know there's going to be an Assassin's Creed at some point.
4603313	4604333	Yeah, they were talking about the sequel.
4604713	4605094	Oh, wow.
4605394	4605874	Very cool.
4606154	4607315	Anything else you've been playing, Xenocor?
4608336	4608716	Oh, yeah.
4608776	4610437	I've been getting Mass Effect out the way.
4611117	4611918	Ah, how is that?
4611978	4613058	I have yet to check that out.
4613098	4615100	I'm very, very curious about Mass Effect.
4615920	4622864	Well, Loki, did you play the beta version or the demo version they had at the trade shows, or did you actually play a full version of it?
4622884	4623965	No, I played a full version of it.
4624886	4625386	All right, because...
4626053	4632156	After the review I heard last week, I'm not sure if you were playing the same game I am, because there wasn't that much talking before I started shooting anyway.
4632657	4633697	No, there was quite a bit of talking.
4635378	4635858	I disagree.
4635898	4639440	But anyway, I'm used to Bioware stuff, so I guess I sort of gloss over it.
4639460	4641622	See, I didn't play anything from Bioware.
4641642	4643523	I didn't play Jade Empire or anything like that.
4643603	4646584	So, you know, maybe this... I could have been nitpicking.
4646644	4648966	I only have 30 minutes of my lunch, and I just want to kill me.
4649026	4650627	Oh, well, there you go.
4650747	4654889	And, you know, hey, 25 minutes of that lunch has spent talking...
4656866	4658107	You missed alien sex.
4659207	4659947	I didn't miss it.
4659987	4661668	There's no fucking alien sex in there.
4661728	4663348	It's implied sex.
4663368	4665369	That's bullshit.
4665429	4669650	Loki says fucking lifetime TV implied sex is what that is.
4669690	4671110	Penetration or it didn't happen.
4672511	4680673	Well, I can't confirm or deny that right now because apparently, based off how far I've gotten into the game, the scene they show isn't from a party member.
4680813	4681833	It's from an NPC.
4682273	4684314	So if there is some party member...
4685211	4686871	I'll eventually get around to playing it.
4686911	4690472	I mean, it's just right now there's, like you said, too many things to play.
4690612	4691532	I'm trying to get rid of some of this, like,
4711178	4712219	I know you play a lot of RPGs, Xenocore.
4712239	4714641	What do you think about the conversation style in Mass Effect?
4714661	4715161	Is it really cool?
4715481	4717403	Is it something you'd like to see in more games?
4727694	4728535	Thanks for watching!
4747529	4747709	All right.
4747809	4748870	Well, again, I'm like Loki.
4748890	4750191	I didn't play the previous games.
4750211	4751593	It'd be good in a Star Trek game.
4751833	4752513	You know what, guys?
4752754	4760340	I think I need to introduce you to Knights of the Old Republic, to Neverwinter Knights, to Jade Empire, all these bioware games that you haven't played.
4760360	4761361	None of those games I've played.
4761441	4762422	None of those games I've played.
4762442	4762902	You need to.
4763383	4771870	There's just too... You know, and I gotta say, and I realize there's a lot of folks listening to this show think we're experts on everything, but, you know, we're gamers just like you guys, and we don't have time for everything.
4772391	4775133	But I definitely want to at least look at everything if I have a chance.
4775438	4780779	That's why I miss E3, because at E3 you could at least look at everything and kind of go, yeah, I'm more interested in this, or I'm not so interested in this.
4781359	4786040	All right, well, Xenocor, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
4786841	4789181	Yeah, just one other point on Mass Effect.
4789221	4790921	The rover kicks ass.
4791382	4794222	I mean, the Warthog is shit now.
4794742	4798123	The Land Rover you get to use in Mass Effect is the new ride I want, man.
4798880	4799240	Interesting.
4799941	4802943	There's so much detail put into the way that vehicle just operates.
4803063	4805125	I could just drive it all day on the planets and stuff.
4805165	4805485	It's great.
4806086	4806686	Very cool.
4807227	4814853	It's kind of interesting hearing about a lot of big games of the year getting compared to Halo 3, where it looks like Halo 3 may not be the game of the year.
4814913	4820638	There's all these other games that are doing these other little things, whereas a lot of folks kind of thought Halo 3 may take the crown.
4820658	4821819	It may not, but we'll see.
4821999	4824181	Yeah, it's because it's Halo 2.5 and not Halo 3.
4824221	4824301	Cool.
4826365	4827986	Omega 5 is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.
4855135	4856396	I'm looking for a kick-ass shooter.
4857337	4861459	Wait, that's not the same thing as the Omega Warhawk expansion.
4861779	4862000	No.
4863000	4863340	Omega 5.
4863661	4866402	It's a Hudson shooter.
4866943	4867443	Interesting.
4868364	4868624	All right.
4869324	4870625	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4870645	4871045	Who's this?
4871706	4872106	What's up?
4872246	4873247	This is Dillinger.
4873487	4874107	Hi, Dillinger.
4874127	4878310	I'm usually Ryoma, but I kind of felt like a name change.
4878806	4880227	Alright, well, hey, you know what?
4880447	4882249	When it's your nickname, you have the right to do that.
4882509	4886031	You're a little bit quiet, so make sure you get a little closer to your mic and tell us what's on your mind.
4887473	4890275	Alright, I wanted to talk a bit about Mario Galaxy.
4890955	4894498	I've basically been playing it over the entire Thanksgiving break.
4895438	4900482	And I've got to say that if you've got a Wii, you have to buy this game.
4900883	4905386	It is kind of childish, and it's a bit easy at the beginning.
4905902	4935346	but once you really get into the game especially the later stuff like you only have to have it's another one of the you have to or there's 120 stars that you can get and you only have to have 60 to go to the final boss but the final 60 is just it is better than everything else in the game it is better than a lot of the stuff in Mario 64 in my opinion there's some really innovative stuff in there I think that Mario Galaxy is basically the definite game to get for the Wii
4936115	4940738	You know, it's kind of interesting because I can hear the excitement in your voice when you're talking about games.
4941018	4944080	And when you hear that excitement, it makes other people excited.
4944180	4949544	So certainly I liked the bits of Mario Galaxy that I have played so far.
4949564	4951625	I haven't bought the full game yet, but I'm kind of curious.
4952305	4954887	What did you think about the motion in that game?
4954947	4957969	Meaning like, you know how it was more of a round environment?
4958309	4963713	I kind of thought it was a game where I'd be able to get disoriented very easily, even more so than most 3D games.
4963753	4964533	Do you find that?
4964573	4965614	Like, was it kind of hard to...
4968896	4971936	Not really.
4972156	4974997	I found that you get used to it after a bit.
4975097	4977378	I mean, I've had a couple of friends over that have played it.
4977418	4978418	My brothers played it.
4979258	4984959	And it's a little weird in the beginning, obviously, because you're getting used to this whole new orientation.
4985480	4987860	But after a little bit, you really get used to it.
4989501	4990701	Have you tried any of the co-op mode?
4990721	4992021	Because I know you said you had your friends over.
4992041	4995262	And I noticed in a commercial I saw the other day, they were really hype in the co-op mode.
4995302	4995662	How is it?
4996377	4998398	Co-op isn't really anything great.
4998498	5003841	All that you can do is you can move your Wiimote around and you can collect the stars for them.
5004362	5006183	Or you can stun the enemies.
5006423	5007984	Or actually you can make them jump.
5008404	5011186	So it's great because you can really mess around with your friends.
5011526	5014948	They'll likely try to jump somewhere and you can tell them to jump earlier.
5015348	5018330	It's pretty stupid, but it's good for a laugh.
5019608	5020508	Very cool.
5020649	5023210	Anything else on the Wii that you're looking forward to this holiday season?
5023450	5024270	Besides Super Mario?
5024290	5024971	Trauma Center.
5025271	5026731	I'm a huge Trauma Center guy.
5026812	5028873	I loved Second Opinion.
5029253	5030493	I never played the DS one.
5030533	5032134	I sold my DS before it came out.
5033135	5036316	But I'm really looking forward to New Blood.
5036336	5039478	I know it's already out, but I also really want to get Geometry Wars.
5040238	5046801	I played it once at my friend's house on Xbox on the 360 off of the Live Arcade or whatever the hell it's called.
5047341	5048342	And it was
5048917	5051558	I vaguely remember you guys doing an interview in Part B of 251
5079338	5082241	I don't remember if it was that or what, but yeah, it's somewhere in there, so check it out.
5082902	5084123	Also, what was the other thing I said?
5084143	5093392	Trauma Center is a game I like as well, and that reminds me, that's something I want to look at, too, is the new Trauma Center game, because it's not just a DS port, like it was actually made for the Wii, so I'm excited about it.
5093412	5094112	Yeah, I heard it got great reviews.
5094453	5095754	Oh, I'm excited, I've got to check that out.
5096124	5097245	Dragon Force is the greatest band ever.
5097265	5097405	I mean,
5126542	5131566	I freaked out when I heard that they were going to be in Guitar Hero 3 even though I can't be through the fire and the plan's an expert.
5132047	5132587	Rock on.
5132968	5133328	I agree.
5133388	5134709	Dragon Force is amazing.
5135069	5135990	I still want them on the show.
5136310	5136631	We'll see.
5137331	5138652	Maybe that'll be my Christmas present.
5139193	5139513	We'll see.
5139613	5140194	That'd be great.
5140614	5141795	Alright, well take care, Dillinger.
5141975	5143016	It was nice to have you on the program.
5143636	5143997	You too.
5144357	5149682	And have fun with Mario Galaxy and good luck in getting all those 120 what-have-you stars that are in that game.
5150222	5150863	It's nuts.
5151683	5153365	Any other last-minute stories you got for us, Loki?
5154706	5154806	Um...
5155333	5156194	There's one I forgot.
5156214	5158075	I didn't make show role for some reason.
5158135	5162759	But Knights Journey into Dreams is coming to the PlayStation 2.
5163800	5166041	The original Knights that was on the Saturn.
5166582	5166902	Nice.
5167863	5170725	You know, I think probably didn't make the show role because we had a short show tonight.
5170805	5172747	But I'm glad that's what I didn't put on there.
5172807	5175469	So, oh, well, then I forgot.
5176230	5177511	No, I do remember reading that, though.
5177611	5178251	So very cool.
5178671	5180473	Let's go to one more call for tonight.
5180533	5181374	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5181394	5181714	Who's this?
5185932	5186753	Caller, are you there?
5187153	5188313	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5188674	5189654	If you're there, say hello.
5189674	5195877	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
5198558	5199218	Caller's not there.
5199278	5203640	Remember, folks, you want to use Echo 123 to test your connection before you give us a call.
5204061	5205982	Or you can just use a regular telephone as well.
5206042	5206742	That always works.
5210424	5213145	Always got to love when the last call of the night is something that fails.
5215819	5218680	Anyhow, let's go ahead and wrap up.
5218760	5221761	On that note, let's wrap up the show tonight.
5222862	5225103	So we're going to do our challenge on Op 11, yes?
5225123	5226383	We're going to do our crossbow challenge?
5226403	5226823	Yes, you're welcome.
5226983	5227364	Awesome.
5227924	5229624	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5230025	5231145	If there's no other last-minute stories?
5231345	5232085	No, no last-minute stories.
5232145	5233446	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5233486	5234646	Drew, thanks for filling in tonight.
5235307	5238708	Sorry you got robbed of half a show, but come back.
5239321	5239942	I am impressed.
5240162	5240723	I hope that...
5252162	5252823	I need my WoW!
5252843	5253043	Loki!
5279994	5282956	I feel hot and I hope I don't have a fever because that would suck.
5284657	5287859	And my final thought is I want more pumpkin pie.
5289400	5292041	And then I want pumpkin coffee and pumpkin everything.
5292061	5293322	I want pumpkin everything.
5294583	5295203	That's what I want.
5296144	5296444	All right.
