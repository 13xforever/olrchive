14184	25974	Tonight, November 18th, 2007, Xbox 360 is getting its own virtual console of sorts, DivX is coming to PlayStation 3, and is the Nintendo DS redesigned on its way next year?
31863	35606	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35646	41371	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41612	42572	My name is Rob Roberts.
42673	48317	Joining me as always, the co-host that make this shiz happen, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48938	51120	Rob gave me chocolate that has booze in it.
51884	57086	I hate to say it, but they didn't card me for it, so the alcohol is presumably cooked out.
57706	60627	I'm pretty sure of it, but I still think that it's very, very tasty.
60687	62487	I've had some that has lots of alcohol in it, though.
62607	63007	That's cool.
63067	63608	I want that.
65008	69309	The ones that had the Grand Marnier in it, and they also had Johnny Walker.
70050	70930	I have not heard of this.
71650	74891	I'll have to find out where Julie got them from, but they do card you for those.
74911	75831	I think you should do that now.
76832	77772	Maybe you can get them at BevMo.
78359	78879	I bet you could.
79760	80000	All right.
80060	82342	Say hello as well to the one and only Loki.
82722	82923	Hello.
82963	84063	How are you doing, Loki?
85004	86786	I'm okay other than a headache.
87146	87386	Okay.
87446	88467	Oh, I'm sorry to hear you have a headache.
88487	90088	Do you need some Tylenol?
90188	90829	No, I already took some.
91169	91549	Profen?
91790	92090	Hammer?
92110	93431	I already took stuff.
93711	93991	All right.
94512	99756	By the way, for the lovely folks watching our webcam feed on Operator 11, you can see Loki's shirt.
99896	100977	Didn't you get this at Fonamay?
101257	102298	Yeah, I got this at Fonamay.
102538	105160	Grand Theft Amish, Penn State, Dutch.
105480	105580	Yes.
105620	105961	Lovely.
107001	107682	Very nice shirt.
108160	109181	DarkSakura.com
137737	139058	and DarkSakura.
153411	168540	Dan came too, and we played a bunch of ticket games at that John's Not Very Amazing Pizza It's John's Incredible Pizza, but we now call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza I can't see the name of it, but it's the new Afterburner that came out like, what, a year ago?
168600	178066	It looked pretty rad, I didn't even know it was there Oh, it's really, really cool, and we played like a bunch of that And I went on this Twister thing Oh my god, William was so funny
178789	186115	and a big hello to the person that worked there, Chris, who stopped us and was like, you're the guys from Original Radio, huh?
186135	187136	And that was kind of cool.
187396	189518	I was like, I need to write this thing first.
189738	190399	Ego++.
191120	191360	What?
191600	192101	Level up.
192141	195383	Yeah, we got recognized from the show by some guy who worked there.
195624	196344	It was pretty awesome.
196905	200768	So he recognized me because DarkSakura was on the ride and then I was like, oh, you gotta go meet Jamie's mom.
200788	202009	Well, she's never on camera anyways.
202029	202610	That's true.
202810	204731	You're not on Op 11, so they don't know what you look like.
204771	206513	But she's in the album art, so I'm sure if
206894	207894	If they've done their homework, they know.
207934	209275	And she's on the All Games page.
209295	210175	There's a picture and all that stuff.
210195	211616	And I've got pictures of me on my MySpace.
211836	212576	Yeah, that's right.
212596	216017	Because I take them with my own camera of myself.
216758	219199	Sadly, I was not able to get free things from the ticket counter.
220399	227702	Because William wanted one of those, it was something really fruity, like a princess backpack or something stupid just to make me buy it for him.
227962	231103	I don't think it was so much that he probably wanted it, but he wanted me to buy it for him.
231542	233824	I wanted the Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
233884	234445	Those were cool.
234485	238688	I wanted the little mini pinball game, because I'm not cool like Jamie, and I have like 20 pinball machines in my house.
238708	240250	Oh, yeah, we traded out one of our pinballs.
240290	243272	We're actually holding some pinball machines for a friend.
243833	246675	And so we got rid of Time Machine, which made me sad, but we have a Black Knight now.
247276	247496	Oh, rad.
247516	249198	Not Black Knight 2000, but the old Black Knight.
249398	249678	That's so cool.
249698	250299	Which is still a cool table.
250319	250799	Yeah, I know.
251520	252501	Oh, sorry, go ahead.
252521	252761	Go ahead.
255021	261564	I'm posting a link in the chat room right now, which apparently I noticed my t-shirt had a web URL on it.
261644	263085	So this is where you can find it.
263125	264165	I had to go through a few links.
264205	273650	But this guy has some other wonderful shirts, including one that's a spoof of the Clerks shirt, or I guess box art from the movie, Clerics.
274110	277672	It says, just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.
278900	280041	I played a lot more Ragnarok of course
305923	312426	I had a really nice game of World Cup Soccer, 94, which was a very, very good game.
314487	319229	I actually watched the entire playthrough of Portal just because I watched it twice.
321070	322210	Did the cake ever come true?
323451	323631	No.
324311	324791	Sorry to hear it.
325912	326092	But
326647	344345	I also, after the show when I got home last week, because I had a three day weekend, because I work for a bank, I was really bored and had bad insomnia, so I completely redid my live journal, and I now have a portal theme.
345206	346446	with a companion cube on it.
346486	348207	With a big old weighted companion cube on it.
348227	350708	I did watch the YouTube of the poor companion.
350768	353189	It was like a companion cube tribute on YouTube.
353229	355269	Yeah, that was... People have the dumbest shit on YouTube.
355289	356210	You were laughing though.
356250	356610	No, I was.
356650	357070	It was funny.
357350	361391	That one part though where they played the... You must now incinerate the cube or whatever.
362072	362552	Oh yeah, didn't they?
362872	363572	Oh yeah.
363592	369414	No, they played the one image in heap song that they always play for like every death scene ever that I've ever seen.
369474	370214	That was great.
370494	371955	Yeah, so like the video is like...
373550	376312	You know, it's doing its thing and it's showing, like, it's like a tribute.
376352	379055	And, like, I was expecting Journey to come in or something.
379475	383418	But then, like, you know, they have to throw the cube in the incinerator because that's what you do in one of the missions.
383778	386761	And then suddenly, you know, the definitive death song comes in.
386781	393967	No, not the companion cube.
394087	399171	And then they kept repeating it and speeding it up.
399231	400452	That was the best ever.
405811	406632	Forget it, I tried.
406973	407974	iTunes just isn't friendly to do that.
408034	409977	It's just like that one SNL digital short that they have.
409997	410177	It is.
410238	411620	It's a total parody of that one short.
412301	413623	It was just the best thing ever.
415865	420890	Dear Sister, thank you, TigerClaw, in the chat room, chat.northshelter.com.
422692	436446	I'll try to find the walkthrough I was watching, but I was watching part seven of the walkthrough, because that's my favorite one, because that's the one where the computer starts going nuts and says, you know, you must lay down in the party retrieval position.
437990	438270	Wow.
438550	439971	Alright, we gotta move on.
440011	441291	We don't have a portal show tonight.
441351	442852	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
443452	444653	My gaming week was okay.
445153	448914	I played Earth Defense Force 2017 again.
449314	454756	We went back to that and actually did pretty well on the Inferno levels.
456357	458698	Hopefully gonna try to finish that game eventually.
459558	464220	I tried a little bit of Mass Effect and there's a whole lot of talking in that game.
464884	469547	They really like to just, you know, use that.
469647	473029	They're like, man, we made a really cool conversation system.
473269	475051	Let's constantly use it.
475451	477772	It's like, my God, shut the hell up.
478153	479854	I want to go on a mission already.
480174	482015	You have the best game reviews, Loki.
482635	486278	Yeah, so I play Mass Effect and it's a lot of talking.
487116	488237	It seriously is.
488417	491438	It's just like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
492059	492859	Oh, my God.
493499	499662	You're here for some reason that's not, you know, good or something, and there's something going on.
499762	500443	I wonder what it is.
500523	504725	And, like, to this point, I'm like, I don't know who you are, nor do I care what's going on.
504885	506346	I just want to go fight something.
507106	512869	And, you know, when I did go fight something, there were these stupid little flying things that shot lasers at me, and...
513957	527823	My guys basically... I had one of my away team members that must have been Sergeant I'm Gonna Die or something because fucker just ran up, started shooting at it, and just stood out in the middle of the open instead of taking cover like a smart person and died instantly.
528603	530824	Naturally, there's feedback from the chat room here.
531785	535346	Odd1 says, Dear God, an RPG where I have to talk to people?
535647	536227	What the hell?
536407	540008	No, but they go on and on and on and on and on.
540649	542750	And I actually was skimming through it.
542910	543170	I mean...
544062	548204	If I wanted to talk to everybody, I could do that as well, and it's just, huh.
548464	552705	SSJ100Matt in chat.orange.studio.com says, They spend a lot on voice actors, Loki.
552725	553345	They gotta use them.
553726	554406	Well, yeah, true.
554806	555746	But no, don't get me wrong.
555766	559628	Speaker Uno invokes Elvis and says, A little more conversation.
559648	561268	Or no, a little less conversation.
561288	562469	A little more action, please.
562629	562849	Get it?
563331	563491	Get it?
563511	569733	I mean, but, you know, to be fair... Okay, to be fair, I played this game, you know, during a lunch, okay?
569893	572534	So, and only half of a lunch, so about 30 minutes.
572874	576796	But, dude, it took me 25 minutes to actually see some action in this game.
577256	578476	So, I mean, that's pretty bad.
578736	580657	But, you know, hey, it's gonna be pretty cool.
580797	591040	So, you know, I'm looking forward to playing a little bit more of the game when I stop playing other games, which one of those other games, of course, would be Rock Band.
591601	592681	And, you know...
594173	602776	I don't want to sound like a fanboy for Rock Band, because I don't really play... I bought Guitar Hero 2 a long time ago and didn't play that much of it.
604037	606457	Rock Band, though, has actually got me excited about music games again.
606797	608818	So, it's, you know, worth playing.
609438	609859	I like it.
609919	610679	I think it's pretty fun.
610699	612159	That's a big fucking statement there.
612500	618422	I mean, I'm actually working my way through the game on, you know, starting on Easy and then, you know, kind of building up from there.
618942	619402	But, um...
620049	620749	Thanks for watching!
642967	644347	I was actually playing on that one time.
644788	652130	Anyways, the drums are good, although I cannot play drums in the house anymore because my wife has told me not to because it's too loud.
652170	653931	They are very loud, those drums.
654451	655571	But it's fun.
656111	657952	I really like the drums in the game.
658499	663681	I have not touched the vocal part of the game yet, but the microphone that comes with it is really nice.
663901	668943	And I hear, though, you can use any USB microphone and it'll work just fine.
669123	673644	Also, I hear the rumor about the Guitar Hero 3 controllers not working in the game is false.
673724	675005	They do work in the game.
675265	675625	Oh, wow.
676605	677346	Oh, yeah.
677806	681407	I was going to say, that's what they were using for the demo unit at the Best Buy near my house.
682728	682828	Oh.
683108	683368	Yeah.
683548	683728	Yes.
684324	687186	I had known I had seen them before somewhere, and I didn't remember.
687366	689788	But I like the guitars that came with the Rock Band game.
689828	690509	Those were nice guitars.
690529	690809	They're nice.
690949	691830	They are really nice.
692730	693871	But yeah, the drums are pretty cool.
693911	696453	They get put together pretty fast.
696533	698335	I mean, it's okay.
699255	703419	I'm still having trouble coordinating both drums and the kick drum, but I have that problem with...
704861	705362	Drum Mania
730489	731509	Thanks for watching!
758078	761120	And it's a good 20 pounds when it's full of all the equipment.
761140	763842	It's a big, big box, and it's not even full right now.
764302	765303	That makes sense, though.
765683	765923	Yeah, I know.
766163	778831	But, yeah, the other bad thing about it, and I had to cut a hole in the side of the box, because right now I'm using up the carry stuff back and forth, is once you put the guitar together, because the little top part kind of snaps on, it doesn't fit in the box anymore.
778851	780472	So I had to cut a hole in the box for the guitar.
781981	783802	Anyway, so yeah, you can create your own characters.
783842	789246	I actually created an emo goth guy called Azrael for my guitarist.
790047	790947	Azrael Abyss!
791187	797512	That's what I was trying to do, but you couldn't fit Azrael Abyss, Prince of Sorrow in there, so I just had to stick with Azrael.
797792	798393	That's great!
799393	800654	It's pretty cool, though.
800694	804998	He looks, I don't know, kind of neat now.
805018	808100	Then my main character, Loki, who's playing drums...
808727	811613	has the Doctor Who jacket, which is kind of neat.
812495	814379	And then, I don't know.
815336	816416	There's a lot of things.
816576	820297	One of the guitars in the game is actually a chainsaw, which is kind of neat.
820857	827019	And then you can create probably a lot of characters that look like Sephiroth or Vincent and stuff.
827139	831060	Because there's a lot of outfits that look like you could make characters look like other things.
831220	837181	I loved the way that the custom characters interface themselves so well into the flow of the game.
837201	840662	They actually... They look like they're in pre-rendered movies.
840862	846385	Well, they actually, in the game, their mouths are synced up with the lyrics and everything.
846826	849327	Their playing is synced up with the song.
849587	853470	So they're not just like fake strumming of the guitar and stuff.
853490	854850	It's actually synced up with the song.
855431	857692	And the drummer actually drums to the song.
857792	859233	So it's pretty realistic.
860194	860494	I like...
861164	863887	The film, you know, graines on it.
877335	883160	But it is funny, though, watching this really emo-looking guy singing Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
884321	885802	Timmy, Timmy!
886203	886903	For East Pop Song, A++.
887564	889445	Yeah, it's a pretty cool game.
889565	890987	You can unlock the tracks pretty easy, too.
891007	895591	They have a bonus little venue that you play that unlocks all the unlockable tracks.
895991	901015	But in order to be able to play the songs in practice mode or whatever, you have to play them through the game.
901375	902677	I don't know, it's pretty nice, but...
904645	906727	I really recommend picking it up if you can find it.
906907	908328	I just know they're going to be really hard to find.
909048	920077	But if you can't find the game with all the instruments and you don't really care about drums too much, you can always pick up a USB microphone and just use your normal Guitar Hero guitar with the game only and save yourself some money that way.
920137	921818	I'll tell you right now where to get Rock Band.
922058	924340	If you go there the morning of the 20th when it comes out, right?
924360	925221	It's Tuesday when it comes out?
925481	926081	Morning of the 20th?
926662	927082	Kmart.
927402	928243	No one shops Kmart.
930084	931405	They might not be getting that many, though.
931625	932206	See, that's the thing.
932971	933412	Get there first.
933432	937334	Everyone's allocations are cut, so go to Best Buy or something like that if you can.
938815	939816	Anything else for your gaming week?
941958	943499	Uh... No.
944660	950564	My gaming week, not too incredibly exciting because I've been going back and forth between Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft.
950584	951264	I've been playing both.
951685	954266	I got my Corsair up to level 19 in Final Fantasy XI.
954286	954407	And, uh...
957123	957924	World of Warcraft 2.3
976464	976724	and so on.
1001069	1002050	It's sort of how dancers are in Ragnarok
1012185	1017888	Yes, and I think in the... Well, no, because in Tactics they were just female bards.
1017968	1018848	They were more buffers.
1019328	1023630	Well, yeah, they do more buffing, but they have range healing and stuff like that.
1023690	1031434	That's exactly how they made them in Final Fantasy XI, is that they're kind of like buffers, but with that range healing, but yet they can provoke the monster, and they're like tanks.
1031714	1032354	It's crazy.
1032904	1034564	Do they dance fight?
1034604	1035865	They just shake their ass.
1036025	1038805	Dude, you can be a Galka dancer.
1038845	1040725	There's videos on YouTube of the Galka dances.
1040785	1041326	It's awesome.
1041626	1049527	You use your TP to do attacks, but the thing is it's like the first job I can think of where you don't have to have 100% TP to do the special attacks.
1049827	1051907	There's things you can do with like 30 TP or 60.
1052628	1054548	And TP is the stuff you build up as you attack.
1054628	1055508	It's toilet paper.
1055848	1056728	Not that kind of TP.
1056768	1057488	Not for your bunghole.
1057648	1059669	You throw your toilet paper at them.
1059809	1060009	Yes.
1060809	1062190	Oh, I was... But then they do little jigs.
1062290	1062770	It's cute.
1062950	1064430	I also forgot, if you don't mind.
1064731	1064891	Sure.
1064971	1066551	I did make the guild for Ragnarok.
1067512	1070473	I would like to congratulate Ranma as being our first member.
1072654	1073214	Congrats.
1074074	1077255	And if you... The guild is just Orange Lounge Radio.
1078756	1079236	Very cool.
1079276	1080056	So look for the icon.
1080316	1080817	Check that out.
1081557	1081837	All right.
1082557	1085119	I'll have to show you the YouTube-age of the Galka dances later.
1085159	1085899	I have to see that.
1086339	1090802	Because Op 11 is slowing down our stream a little bit because we're doing too much bandwidth.
1090842	1091422	I can't handle it.
1091923	1092643	What else did I play?
1092723	1097266	Really quickly, I played that new word-searching game on Xbox 360, just the demo.
1097866	1101448	I was a little disappointed that it's just basically an over-glorified word-search game.
1101548	1105331	It just kind of seems like a casual game, something that Mom might like.
1105371	1105631	I don't know.
1107071	1110652	Mutant Storm Empire, though, much improved over the first Mutant Storm.
1110712	1112632	I think I need to go back and buy that one.
1113232	1126355	I think the greatest change they made to it is that they made levels feel more like levels, where it's almost like Smash TV, kind of, where you're walking through from room to room, and it doesn't have that really slow loading time transition between the different rooms.
1126375	1130176	Did you now buy the, or not buy, but download the free Casserone?
1130856	1131396	Carcassone?
1132296	1134297	Casserone is something you cook for dinner, I think.
1134377	1135097	Casserole!
1135117	1135437	Casserole.
1136678	1137859	Carcassonne, I already had it.
1138099	1138779	Calzone?
1138799	1139560	I got ripped off.
1139580	1147703	I already bought Carcassonne like two weeks ago, or not two weeks ago, like two months ago when it was, not when it was first out, but about a month after it was first out, I bought Carcassonne.
1147723	1151105	So I was kind of pissed when I heard that it was out for free.
1151145	1151785	But what can you do?
1152025	1152886	That kind of stuff happens.
1154547	1155387	That's pretty much it.
1156427	1159709	Pete Caruno played Screwjumper and said it sucks balls.
1160521	1163182	Well, yeah, this week's releases kind of suck balls.
1163262	1167665	All I heard is that Picaruno beat my Boom Boom Rocket score, so I know what game I've got to play this week.
1168205	1170506	And maybe, maybe I will use the guitar.
1170526	1172007	You know what we have to do, Rob?
1173007	1174348	What we didn't do last week?
1174388	1174908	Metroid!
1174928	1176189	We haven't done it in the past three months.
1176209	1181212	And I'm leaving on Thursday, so we'll have to do it early this week.
1181252	1181592	Soon?
1182372	1186134	I don't work Thursday and Friday, thankfully, but you're like, oh, I'm going to leave because I can't.
1186214	1189136	I'm leaving midnight, like when it turns midnight.
1189196	1189456	Right.
1190322	1192983	Yeah, so we'll have to do it on Tuesday.
1193003	1193724	All right.
1194524	1196285	Well, let's get into some housekeeping.
1196645	1203929	Speaking of Jamie leaving, Jamie will be on vacation for the next two weeks from the show, so she's not going to be here next week or the week after.
1204009	1204489	Cry.
1205130	1205710	How dare she?
1205770	1207191	Maybe she'll... But, Rob.
1207411	1207611	What?
1207771	1208371	Fried chicken.
1208792	1211093	Maybe she'll bless us with her presence via the telephone.
1211133	1211473	Who knows?
1211553	1211993	Maybe.
1212233	1212674	We'll see.
1212694	1215035	And, you know, monkeys might... Never mind.
1216587	1220469	I don't know if we'll have somebody else here or if it'll just be the Loki and Rob show.
1221029	1226632	I'm going to try to reach out to Rice Princess so we can have a female perspective of Jamie's absence, but I don't know if she can make it.
1226772	1229533	I'll have you know, Rob, the Wii Zapper comes out next week.
1229993	1230754	Oh, I have one.
1231614	1232494	How'd you do that already?
1233115	1236276	Freebies from the Game Crazy Manager thing.
1236376	1237476	How does that work?
1237617	1238677	What do we have that uses it?
1240118	1240758	But we have one!
1242242	1243083	We have a Wii Zapper.
1243403	1243783	All right.
1244083	1245984	But there's Link's crossbow training.
1246445	1248046	Oh, yeah, but I didn't care about that.
1249266	1253889	So, yeah, the great Loki and Rob challenge with the Wii Zapper might go down.
1254509	1256451	You should have Nellie come on the show.
1257831	1258432	Eh, she doesn't want to.
1258532	1258952	Perhaps.
1259172	1260553	She's got to watch Cesper Housewives.
1260613	1261173	We'll bribe her.
1261494	1266096	What few episodes are left while the Writers Guild's striking?
1266457	1269659	I told Dan to come on the show with me after I get back.
1269679	1269879	You should.
1269899	1270159	You should.
1271415	1273817	Dan on the show is... Comedy.
1274999	1275920	Yeah, it's hilarity.
1276040	1278142	Dan at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza was pretty funny.
1278763	1281466	I think, didn't he coin the phrase John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
1281586	1282127	No, that was me.
1282747	1283749	He had another term for it.
1283789	1285370	Incredibly Sucky Pizza.
1285450	1287252	Yeah, John's Incredible World of Suck or something.
1288674	1289215	Alright, anyway.
1291037	1292138	Our poor friend who works there.
1292725	1294568	Orange Lounge Radio Gamer Pick
1307165	1307926	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1326172	1327693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1354662	1355463	Thank you for watching.
1355483	1356024	See you next time.
1370863	1388378	Might I also add, there is lots of other great podcasts in Community Gamer Picks 1, and hopefully someday there'll be a Community Gamer Picks 3, but more of you guys have to download them and use them, and then they go, oh, people like this stuff, so we should get more blogs and more indie shows and that stuff in there.
1388478	1390019	So, very cool.
1391482	1397326	Also, after tonight's show, I think I already mentioned this, on Operator 11, a special live preview for Rock Band.
1397806	1404711	And last week we did one for Mario Galaxy, and the folks in chat really seemed to like that, and it was very well received.
1404991	1409934	So I'm hoping we can do more of these in the future, in these live preview shows on Sundays, and other Op 11 specials.
1410655	1410895	Alright.
1411937	1412217	Sky, DrunkShow
1439497	1442439	No, because I have to work the Monday after the four-day weekend, so not likely.
1442499	1443040	But you never know.
1443140	1445121	Stay tuned to the station.
1445942	1447463	You never know when we'll go live randomly.
1448684	1449664	And let's see.
1449704	1450265	What else do we have?
1450285	1451265	I thought there was another one I wanted to see.
1451345	1453607	Oh, Gerardimo says, Can Loki sing in the preview?
1453627	1455428	I don't know.
1455448	1456329	I don't know.
1456349	1457149	You're going to have to bribe him.
1457169	1458530	I don't know, Loki.
1458550	1458971	What do you think?
1460572	1462773	Could you at least read us some news in a Tingle outfit?
1464474	1464734	No.
1464754	1465355	All right.
1465375	1466435	Could you at least read us some news?
1466876	1468157	Yeah.
1468317	1468597	Anyways.
1469261	1474742	So there was a big announcement about the fall update, or winter update, I guess now.
1476983	1483405	Actually, it kind of leaked out first that the Xbox Originals are going to be made available to download.
1484265	1491187	What those are basically going to be is just a selection of original Xbox games that you can download straight to your hard drive and play.
1492167	1496028	So this is actually going to be happening, it has been confirmed, and...
1496673	1498054	HALO, PSYCHONAUTS, KRIMSOM SKIES, FABLE
1523746	1537031	There were some other third-party ones that were also reported, which were Indigo Prophecy, Crash Bandicoot, Wrath of the Cortex, and Burnout 3 Takedown, which I thought was a pretty good Burnout game.
1539252	1539873	Let's see here.
1540093	1547215	Also, as part of the follow-up, they have, of course, that parental timer, and then who knows what else they'll throw in there as well.
1547375	1549376	But that's mainly the big thing.
1549616	1551137	Although, if you're expecting, you know,
1552193	1554454	Some wonderful things from these Xbox originals.
1556334	1563496	Time to kind of calm down a little bit because they're really just downloadable Xbox games.
1563516	1563876	That's it.
1563916	1569137	I mean, they're emulated through the same software that emulates the current Xbox games that you can just pop a disc in there.
1569637	1576019	So all the bugs that were in those emulations are going to be the same thing on these download titles.
1576259	1581080	So in other words, if you thought Microsoft was going to take the virtual console idea and do it better...
1582183	1582463	Wrong.
1583203	1583383	Yeah.
1583843	1588185	Basically, you know, they're going to have choppiness when the game's loading up.
1589005	1594006	Also, if there's content like demos and stuff, selecting them might actually crash the game.
1594646	1597527	You know, stuff that's on these original Xbox games.
1597547	1601388	So it's really just straight port, and they're just available to download.
1601688	1604069	No achievements, no nothing.
1604369	1605549	So that's it.
1605749	1607790	It's a little bit of a big deal.
1608490	1608650	But...
1609820	1615644	Cool news for people that maybe missed it, because there's some people who didn't buy an Xbox One who have an Xbox 360, you know what I mean?
1616044	1617165	So that might be good for them.
1617305	1620467	So, I mean, if you're up to it, they will be made available.
1620748	1622509	Obviously, this is an optional purchase.
1622529	1627372	You don't necessarily need to buy it, but I don't know.
1628227	1630989	VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV
1656952	1660134	But still, I probably wouldn't buy these things if I still have the discs sitting around.
1660554	1663376	Exactly, and the other thing too is, I mean, some of these games are pretty old.
1663416	1666717	I mean, you can probably find them really cheap if you really want to look for them.
1666858	1681185	Maybe this will be incentive, if they make money off this, maybe this will be incentive for them to go back to the, in the Xbox archive and make, because they haven't touched the backwards compatibility in a long time and made some more games like backwards compatible, like DDR, like still not backwards compatible, right?
1682266	1685728	Maybe this will be incentive for them to go dip in the library and make some old stuff backwards compatible.
1686778	1691662	But I swear to God, if they make things like Silent Hill 2 and Silent... Was Silent Hill 3 on Xbox?
1691722	1692122	I think it was.
1692883	1694624	I only had 2 and 4, so I don't know.
1694825	1696146	No, I don't think it was.
1696586	1698047	I was playing it on PS2.
1698327	1705473	But my copies have vanished probably when I moved, so I would download that shit in a heartbeat just to have the load times and stuff.
1706274	1707615	Some of that stuff's going to be cool, I think.
1707755	1708075	We'll see.
1709556	1715301	Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to mention during housekeeping that I totally forgot because we forgot to note it on our little notes thingy.
1715749	1735196	This is great what's been released from our community and it's on the forums and it's something called OL Revolution and it's basically a Stepmania pack with all these songs that are based on like inside jokes from the show and there's some completely horrid stuff in there like
1736187	1745013	Like five years ago when we would go on the stream randomly and I would sing over DDR songs, like people recorded that shit somehow and have stepped it.
1745633	1754919	And some of those like god-awful DMN remixes that he's taken, and I say that with love, that he's taken like bits and pieces of our show and put them over DDR songs, they're like all in there with steps.
1754999	1760703	And then like things that are in jokes to like other shows on the station, like just hilarious.
1761143	1762064	It's all in the forums.
1762796	1764297	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1793123	1798371	But I swear to God, if that shit gets out, that karaoke stuff gets out there too much, I'm going to have issues.
1798631	1800634	We're going to have words, Dark Tetsuya, in the parking lot.
1802076	1805378	I'll kick your butt in Rock Band, which we were talking about a little earlier in the game.
1805538	1812583	Lots and lots of news coming out on Rock Band as the game gets closer and closer to release, including information about the download packs.
1813083	1819207	And Rock Band has decided they've got to stick it to Guitar Hero 3 by making the packs a little bit cheaper.
1819287	1823750	Instead of 500 points for Guitar Hero 3 packs, 440 Microsoft points.
1824131	1825932	That equates to, do the math in your head,
1827980	1831241	$5.49.
1828080	1831241	But you don't just have to buy songs in packs.
1831681	1833502	You can buy individual songs.
1833922	1838424	It could go anywhere from 80 Microsoft points to 240 Microsoft points.
1838584	1840444	That's $0.99 to just under $3.
1841405	1845466	Most of them, they say, will be $1.99, 159 Microsoft points.
1846346	1848407	Okay, 159 Microsoft points.
1848887	1851448	I'm going to have all these leftover stupid points somewhere.
1851668	1852889	Just do like...
1853986	1858307	160.
1854886	1858307	But I mean, they have so much stuff coming out just when the game comes out.
1858607	1868190	They have on November 20th, the Metallica Pack, the Police Pack, the Queens of the Stone Age Pack, and some individual tracks such as My Sharona and Cherry Bomb.
1868810	1875092	I would also like to point out that the week of November 27th, while Jamie is gone and she can't play it, there's a David Bowie pack coming out.
1875652	1875992	Ha ha.
1876352	1877352	Who says I can't play it?
1877372	1879373	Are you going to have Rock Band in Alabama?
1881434	1881754	Ha ha.
1882134	1882914	I think I want to get back.
1884341	1886702	Black Sabbath Pack comes out on December 4th.
1886722	1887982	That is so getting downloaded.
1889022	1893403	And December 18th, look at this, some individual tracks.
1893824	1903406	First you get a Pretender song, Brass in Pocket, Weezer, Buddy Holly, and just for you, DarkSakura, God is Listening, My Iron Lung by Radiohead on December 18th.
1903926	1904406	There you have it.
1904647	1905787	I loves me some Radiohead.
1906407	1908748	But see, it's kind of cool that they have stuff coming out each week.
1909548	1910168	That is very cool.
1910188	1911308	I hope it continues.
1912129	1913289	I hope we get stuff on Christmas.
1914192	1914492	We'll see.
1916113	1916433	I don't know.
1916593	1918094	I don't want to buy some of these.
1918435	1920776	Fortunate Son actually sounded kind of cool.
1921196	1924358	I like the fact that they have some individual pricing to it as well.
1924378	1924978	That's very cool.
1925199	1926960	Yeah, not all this I'm going to want to buy.
1927980	1930682	But I'm very happy.
1931542	1940228	Well, for anyone who is looking for these on Guitar Hero 3, there is a free Boss Battle download pack that's basically...
1941391	1947615	Just the devil went down to Georgia and all the other three boss battle songs, so that's pretty cool.
1948616	1951258	But I think that the best part about it is that it's free.
1951998	1952519	I like free.
1952859	1953639	Free is good.
1953659	1955861	So you can play these outside of career mode.
1956802	1957042	Awesome.
1958143	1960304	Anyways, something not... Wait, wait, wait.
1961345	1963306	Yeah, I ran out real quick, but I wanted to comment on that.
1963686	1963746	It...
1965166	1971210	I'm glad they did it for free because otherwise we all would have been screaming that it was pay-to-unlock content because those songs were kind of already in the game.
1971650	1973592	But I think it's a nice little extra.
1974132	1975133	It's nothing huge.
1975493	1979756	But The Devil Went Down to Georgia is an awesome song, so I'm really glad they made that available to play whenever I want.
1979896	1980596	I like that cover.
1980997	1981957	Yes, so good jobs.
1982077	1982878	Okay, now, Loki, you can go.
1983706	1997130	Anyways, so UK retailer Tesco actually slipped up because on their online store they were selling the Xbox 360 Hollative Bundle, which is normally 340 pounds.
1998250	2001231	They were selling it for only 33 pounds.
2001971	2003712	Whoopsie!
2004612	2010554	And apparently it was long enough for a number of customers to order the system and
2012126	2020288	Although Sky News is saying that once the payment is accepted, trading standards rules in the UK state that the retailer must comply and deliver the product.
2021109	2036753	However, they have said, despite the rules, Tesco site maintains that they do not have to conform to erroneously marked prices unless they fail to notice before shipment.
2038773	2040394	That's going to cause a stink.
2042423	2049204	but there was apparently some consumers like one that ordered 39 consoles although none of them have been delivered yet.
2051925	2054205	They'd have to do at least a full refund on price.
2054805	2058706	Yeah, especially like, you know, you consider that guy probably thought he was doing a smart thing.
2058766	2063367	Hopefully they won't try to like charge him for all those Xbox 360s or he's not going to be happy.
2064447	2065467	I don't think they can do that.
2066087	2066627	Probably not.
2067148	2067528	Probably not.
2068648	2069248	I want to point out
2070094	2078220	In response to the last story, because there's a bit of a delay from when we say it to when the live listeners hear it, Actdeft says, Free is good, except for Yaris.
2080422	2080842	Good point.
2083064	2084885	You do pay in time, don't you?
2085906	2091890	I have more Rock Band stuff, and this is not going to be free, sadly, but this sounds like really cool.
2092551	2099396	This came from an interview with the official Xbox magazine, and some more details have surfaced from Harmonix about Rock Band, and apparently...
2100296	2103697	You're going to be able to take your band and export it to a webpage.
2104177	2114519	And from there, you can take band avatars, pose your band avatars, make album covers with your band logo, make all these different scenes, and then you can turn that into real world stuff.
2115500	2125122	You can make figurines based on these rock band characters, t-shirts that have the fake album art on them, and then tour dates that are just basically the accomplishments from the game.
2125791	2127132	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2150525	2151526	It's still kind of neat.
2151726	2155048	There is the Madden thing where you can buy a fucking ring for like $500.
2155088	2156209	That's true.
2156249	2157110	That's a little crazy.
2157490	2164455	I'm excited to see how this plays out because obviously it's not up there yet, but it must be coming soon because the game is out on Tuesday.
2165716	2167517	I will say, though, there are some pretty interesting scenes.
2167637	2169439	There are some of the load screens on there.
2169479	2177124	They will have fake album art and stuff like that and fake little portraits and stuff with your characters that you design in it.
2177985	2181066	I thought the trivia was interesting.
2181606	2187668	We played the Freeze Pop song and it said something about Freeze Pop once got arrested in Canada and ate lots of poutine.
2188249	2191830	And I was like, that's completely random.
2192070	2193630	I'm like, wow.
2194731	2197292	I'm like, do people outside of Canada even know what poutine is?
2197352	2197912	I don't think so.
2198332	2198632	We'll see.
2198932	2199172	Anyway.
2199512	2200293	I don't know what it is.
2200553	2202253	It's basically french fries and gravy.
2202833	2203674	That sounds really yummy.
2203934	2204094	Fuck.
2204813	2207654	I have Canadian friends online that blog about it.
2207734	2208754	It's so good, apparently.
2209494	2209795	I don't know.
2209935	2211255	I know we've got Canadian listeners.
2211715	2214916	I kind of do that with my leftover chips from the British food store.
2216277	2216517	All right.
2217117	2218897	I put chip shop curry on it.
2219418	2221638	Why is it this show always turns into the food show?
2222118	2223439	Because we're hungry.
2223459	2225459	Does food and gaming go hand in hand like that?
2225980	2226260	Yes.
2226540	2226820	All right.
2227440	2227740	Anyhow.
2228720	2232842	Well, for other stuff, Rob, the
2234212	2244241	For anyone who is familiar with Atlas USA, they are bringing out Spectral Force 3 and Operation Darkness for Xbox 360, which is pretty cool.
2244761	2250626	Atlas gave us Trauma Center on Wii, so we are getting their new localizations.
2251347	2257432	And they made the cute little tactical game with the voice acting on PS2.
2258173	2259394	God damn it, why can't I think of it?
2259494	2261256	Really popular, just got a sequel recently.
2261829	2262450	Disgaea.
2262470	2263290	Thank you, Disgaea.
2263310	2263971	Disgaea, yeah.
2264291	2265552	And Persona, they made that too.
2265812	2266994	Yep, and we like Persona.
2267114	2267914	Well, they published it.
2268235	2269456	So we're getting more.
2269476	2270156	Oh, true, true.
2270416	2272538	Yes, they're publishing, but yeah, we're getting more fun.
2272558	2273319	Big difference, my bad.
2274680	2279364	But I was going to say that Operation Darkness looked like crap, by the way.
2280265	2284609	It's like, I don't know, it looked dumb from when I remember when they were first showing video of that.
2285469	2288892	Anywho, so Lionhead...
2290336	2292917	You may remember them from the Fable series.
2293217	2297399	Well, they're looking for some custom insults for Fable 2.
2298079	2306942	So they actually have a whole thing where you can submit your insults to them, and apparently if they like it, they will put it in the game.
2307863	2309023	So that's kind of neat.
2312104	2312684	I have one.
2313925	2316466	Your gameplay makes me want to go play a PlayStation 3.
2318126	2318567	Is that good?
2318967	2319087	No.
2319107	2319167	No.
2319972	2333138	Some of the ones that they were saying that were on there already, Groin Crab, Loner McLonleyton, and Big Girls Blouse, which I don't understand that.
2334979	2339641	What do you think would happen if I submitted their names to call people?
2340660	2348667	You know, to be honest, all they need to do is monitor names and little catchphrases that are in Animal Crossing because, I mean, that's what people do anyway.
2348747	2349227	Oh, good point.
2349307	2353431	NintendoManiac64 in chat says, Sky, instead of PlayStation 3 on that console, try N-Gage.
2353991	2354431	That's good.
2354672	2355152	Burn!
2355572	2356073	Oh, snap.
2356333	2364179	I was going to say, as a joke, if you're supposed to submit things that are name-calling or whatever, let's all submit Bobby Blackwolf as a name-calling thing.
2365300	2365621	Funny.
2366922	2368163	Just kidding, Bobby, if you're listening.
2368323	2368563	Hearts.
2369551	2370452	All right, moving on.
2371433	2378702	One thing that they don't want you putting your opinions in and don't want you asking about anymore is Bioshock on the PlayStation 3.
2379803	2381485	Damn it, Sony fanboys.
2381525	2383408	2K Games has given you the smackdown.
2383728	2385010	It is not happening.
2385350	2387673	It's an official response on the 2K forums.
2388616	2394020	And this is what the moderator had to say, quote, Please don't tell me you made an account just for this question.
2394440	2397242	There will be no PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock.
2397663	2399824	It has been explained time and time again.
2401285	2408990	So if you were hoping to save some, what do they call them, little sisters on the PlayStation 3 version, not going to happen.
2409051	2409591	Sorry, kids.
2409971	2410532	Bioshock 2?
2411733	2412273	You never know.
2412493	2414675	I mean, you know there's got to be a Bioshock 2 at some point.
2414695	2419057	This game's getting amazing reviews, but Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3?
2419177	2422499	Well, if there's enough PlayStation 3s out there, they'll probably do it.
2423900	2424600	So, that's that.
2425060	2426701	No Bioshock for you PlayStation 3 kids.
2427121	2428782	But, but, but, we like... No!
2429142	2429783	Okay.
2430183	2430743	I said no!
2431083	2435926	Well, they are now putting out something very interesting for PlayStation 3.
2436366	2438407	I think this is very interesting.
2438427	2438467	Um...
2440362	2445352	Trend Micro Incorporated is putting out antivirus software for the Playstation 3.
2445392	2445472	It's
2449255	2458284	I don't know, that's sort of interesting, but they're saying that the home systems now are going to be vulnerable to spyware and viruses for being able to go on the internet.
2458364	2461207	Is that so my PlayStation 3 doesn't get herpes?
2461227	2470556	I don't know if it's antivirus software, but I think Trend Micro is doing the parental controls on the internet browser that they're going to add.
2471116	2472378	I think they've already added them with...
2473997	2474637	and DarkSakura.com
2505051	2505291	What?
2505732	2505972	Sad.
2506692	2507773	Anyways, I got it for free.
2520896	2521837	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2547847	2548467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2577759	2583780	They come out for like one or two games, and then they're not continued to be supported, therefore the peripherals never sell.
2584260	2588561	You have to make a ton of games for the peripherals in order for them to finally sell.
2589341	2594463	Like, for example, for example here, the Xbox Vision camera.
2595503	2595983	Yeah, exactly.
2596003	2604105	That is a piece of useless crap, and I'm sad to have made that mistake twice now with both the iToy and the Vision camera.
2607028	2611711	and that's why I haven't bought a PlayStation Eye yet because I don't want to buy another useless camera.
2614332	2614933	Exactly.
2614973	2618335	How many things can you use that stupid vision cam for?
2618675	2622077	One, to make your own icon on Xbox Live that only your friends can see.
2622457	2623418	Yay, Totem Ball!
2623438	2624538	That game was awesome!
2624558	2629241	I'm not even going to count Totem Ball because that's something against the Xbox Live camera.
2629701	2632743	And then there's Strip Uno.
2633283	2633703	That's it.
2634964	2636105	That's all the cam is good for.
2636479	2639260	And they also have strip, you know, checkers, strip chests.
2639500	2641780	Yeah, and I guess you also have hardwood hearts or whatever.
2641840	2643040	But who plays those games?
2643140	2644080	Hardwood hearts.
2646161	2650182	But seriously, did you play the spy glass games or whatever it was called?
2650242	2651142	It was kind of crap.
2651982	2653082	It was kind of sloppy.
2653142	2653442	I don't know.
2653462	2654062	I didn't like it at all.
2654082	2659723	Just because, you know, a game supports the fucking camera, which, to be honest, I think all of the games should support the damn camera.
2661904	2662204	I don't know.
2662524	2662744	Yeah.
2663874	2684887	Jason brings up a point, Texas Hold'em supports it now, I forgot about that Oh yeah, that is true I haven't played Texas Hold'em in a long time Which is too bad because I think we were invited to a tournament And that reminds me, I need to reply to that email Because we're being stuck up by not replying, my bad Alright, but we really suck at Hold'em Is anybody good at Hold'em?
2684947	2688449	I was okay Really, you should play for us then, I don't want to play I'm not that good
2689259	2691540	I'm okay at it.
2691580	2692481	We could all play.
2692501	2695062	We could all go to the same place and play together.
2695082	2696143	I have better things to play.
2697163	2701486	I played Hold'em once with Bobby for maybe 20 minutes and that was it.
2703325	2706986	All right, anyhow, very cool news for the PlayStation 3.
2707866	2708546	Yes, that's right.
2708626	2710166	Very cool news for the PlayStation 3.
2710366	2711447	I'm completely serious here.
2711467	2712327	Yeah, I know.
2712767	2715508	DivX is going to be partnering with Sony.
2715748	2717488	This is based on an announcement from DivX.
2717768	2721389	They're going to be integrating its video playback technology into the PlayStation 3.
2722849	2730491	So if you update your development kits to 2.0, you can already utilize the DivX technology for your games.
2731351	2732291	And hopefully...
2733357	2743764	If DivX gets enabled in a future PlayStation 3 firmware upgrade, which at this point, who's to say why wouldn't it, then you can actually watch all the porn that you download over the internet and all the pirated movies.
2744064	2747006	You'll be able to watch that over your local network.
2747046	2749488	That would be totally useful for someone who pirates.
2750969	2753050	Too bad that I will not be using that.
2753090	2754671	Yes, not that you should be pirating.
2754811	2756212	That's wrong.
2757493	2759795	And yeah, you should not be doing that.
2760956	2763017	Well, if it's on the internet, it must be okay to download, right?
2763882	2766326	I mean, they wouldn't put something illegal on the internet, would they?
2766586	2767608	No, of course not.
2768550	2773418	That's just completely... Question from OL Army Ninja in chat.
2774998	2778980	Did OLR really just go two whole stories about Sony and not bad talk them?
2779461	2784323	Look, we said a long time ago, when Sony does something right, we will give them credit for it.
2785283	2786824	And then we'll make fun of them for everything else.
2787184	2789765	I'm equally offensive against all consoles.
2789825	2797049	Like, for example, this week's live edition, fucking Shrek enroll in Screwjumper.
2797069	2798229	What the fuck is that shit?
2798930	2799610	Shrek enroll.
2799650	2803592	First of all, Shrek should never be on the fucking Xbox Live Arcade ever.
2803866	2805027	Orange Bucks
2832947	2833127	Portal.
2833147	2834528	That is no lie, unlike the cake.
2834568	2834768	Portal.
2860390	2862831	Yeah, are you saying just buy this game for Portal and the hell with everything else?
2862851	2864351	Just buy it for Portal and the hell with everything else.
2865011	2878455	Although I did find a very interesting thing on looking, because I was reading some of the forums about it, because people are trying to piece in where Portal is supposed to fit in the Half-Life story, which I thought was really cool speculation, because I love speculating about storylines and things.
2878495	2878835	Hold on.
2879155	2880715	Are you telling me there's Portal fanfic?
2881195	2881376	No.
2881856	2882536	It actually does fit.
2882556	2883096	There is.
2884356	2886137	And there's weighted companion cube fan art.
2886597	2886697	Ah!
2887634	2890736	As long as it's not weighted companion cube slash, then we're okay.
2891336	2905904	No, but I was reading just how they were speculating how it fitted in, and someone was saying that there's a way that you can import the Half-Life 2 maps into Portal, and you can use the Portal gun in Half-Life 2.
2906704	2907604	I think it's the other way around.
2907825	2911867	It was saying specifically that they moved the maps to the Portal folder.
2912607	2914308	It was using some program or something.
2914810	2916130	I think it's the other way around.
2916150	2918371	They imported the portal gun into Half-Life 2.
2918431	2921092	But yeah, you can do that.
2922032	2924813	Anyways, I was going to say there is... You can probably do both.
2924913	2932596	If you notice in the game, actually there's a few times where you can see through the window and there's a little slide projector.
2932656	2940338	They're showing Aperture Science versus I don't remember what the other corporation is in Half-Life 2, so forgive me there.
2940882	2943404	But a whole little thing about that.
2943524	2946346	I guess they're making competing technologies and stuff.
2947086	2948507	And it's even in the song, too.
2948747	2952570	They're talking about that whole thing.
2952650	2955292	Why are people in the chat saying Rule 34 and laughing?
2955332	2957333	Is that a Portal joke that I don't get?
2957353	2960235	I don't know.
2962556	2963357	I still haven't played it.
2964978	2966879	Maybe I'll download it on Steam this week.
2966899	2967159	We'll see.
2967199	2969101	I can't tear myself away from the MMOs long enough.
2969141	2969541	Forgive me.
2971529	2974551	So, Assassin's Creed, it's quite interesting.
2974591	2980413	There's been reports coming out now that the PlayStation 3 version, let's see here.
2980633	2981574	Oh, I'm sorry, that's your story.
2981914	2982434	Never mind.
2983575	2984995	PlayStation Store updates, yes.
2985596	2992759	Lots of cool stuff for the PlayStation Store this week, including actually one that I was kind of looking at, although I played something very similar to it.
2992819	2995860	I want to say it was actually on the PlayStation Network.
2996000	3000182	Toy Home, it's a little car racing game, kind of like Micro Machines or something like that.
3000882	3003823	High Velocity Bowling Time Crisis 4, Battlefield, Bad Company, Burnout Paradise Other than...
3024938	3026079	Dark Knight Teaser Trailer
3050006	3050346	DarkSakura.com
3075391	3080015	You might want to watch out for this, though, or maybe you won't get to access that PlayStation Store.
3080055	3085179	And that is the brand-newly-discovered white screen of death on the PlayStation 3.
3086200	3086880	And the cause?
3087521	3088622	Assassin's Creed.
3089269	3096914	Apparently, some folks who are using firmware 2.0 are getting the white screen of death while playing Assassin's Creed.
3097694	3100736	This is coming up on posts on the Ubisoft forums.
3101397	3108361	And apparently, there's a lot of folks that are posting about these freezing issues and bug glitch issues.
3108981	3109902	So, there you have it.
3109982	3110663	No real...
3113434	3113855	and DarkSakura.
3124144	3129385	Yeah, the game actually had a worse frame rate slightly than the Xbox 360 version.
3129605	3134146	And there's also some videos online of some pretty weird glitches in the game, like one where you fall through the earth.
3134166	3138488	There's another one where your character kind of clones himself.
3139248	3141368	And so you're controlling two copies of your character.
3141648	3146910	Now, someone on my friends list played both and actually said the PlayStation 3 is a little better.
3148050	3152371	So maybe if these issues don't come to haunt you, then you're...
3153644	3154124	You're fine.
3154764	3155245	It doesn't matter.
3156385	3159946	I was going to say also that the game ain't that good.
3161006	3161667	That's another thing.
3161687	3162507	You didn't like it, really?
3162907	3163027	No.
3163047	3164007	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
3164027	3165048	I've played a little bit of it.
3165348	3168829	I've played it, yeah, but a lot of people are really liking it.
3169029	3170369	What else was I going to say about that?
3170389	3171330	What is it you don't like about it?
3171850	3172410	It's boring.
3173210	3173710	It really is.
3173851	3175091	It's not as... You can kill people.
3176091	3176511	Okay.
3176911	3177872	Well, that's like any game.
3178672	3179652	So, I don't know.
3180673	3181493	I just didn't care for it.
3182798	3184579	I didn't see what the fuss was about.
3184599	3185700	All right.
3187020	3198866	Well, there was a rumor circulating around that Capcom was thinking about putting a Resident Evil 5 demo on the Blu-ray for Resident Evil Extinction.
3199827	3203128	And also another one saying that Devil May Cry 4 would have a demo on there.
3203589	3206330	But Capcom said, uh-uh, they're just putting trailers up.
3207651	3209011	That would have been so cool, though.
3209712	3209852	I know.
3209872	3211793	There's a lot of people very excited about Resident Evil 5.
3212691	3213492	Capcom should do it.
3215274	3216935	I'm still... The demo is a lie.
3217756	3220198	They should put like a really crappy demo for something.
3220579	3224082	Just have like, you know, a stick figure with like a... They should put Doom on there.
3224502	3226685	Yet another bastardization of Mega Man.
3227846	3230949	No, they should do like Resident Evil with Doom graphics.
3232410	3233051	With all pixel...
3234025	3234365	I like this.
3234765	3238726	Odd1 in chat says, God, I need that Resident Evil 5 demo.
3239046	3241647	Notice how it's not like I want, I wish they would put it out there.
3241667	3243047	He says, I need it.
3244467	3245248	I need it now.
3247228	3250509	I need Animal Crossing Wii, but I'm just going to have to wait a little longer.
3250689	3251289	Life sucks.
3252669	3252909	Wait.
3254370	3256210	Dennis Leary says, life sucks, wear a helmet.
3257190	3259491	Life's going to suck when you grow up.
3260131	3260711	That's all I know.
3261161	3267245	Anyways, well, there's a few games, though, that you're not going to have to wait much longer to play, and that's the stuff coming out this week.
3267806	3271868	So, in the U.S., starting off here... Oh, dear God, Friday.
3272389	3274791	I know, oh my God, the release dates for Japan are huge.
3274811	3280695	Everybody, give sympathy to our... Everybody, get a book, get a pillow, we're going to have a long segment for release dates this week.
3280795	3284037	Everybody, feel sorry for our retail workers this Friday.
3284777	3287639	No, it's not going to be a long segment, actually, there's not a lot coming out this week.
3287720	3289741	Oh my God, the Japanese ones are huge.
3290376	3296039	Anyways, I was just going to mention, I think this came out last week already, and I have kind of a last-minute story about it later on.
3296479	3302582	Avatar, the Burning Earth, now the new record holder for the fastest way to get achievements on Xbox 360.
3302822	3303102	Hooray.
3303442	3304223	So that's coming out now.
3305473	3306874	Baby Pals on the DS.
3306934	3309035	Yes, it's another fucking baby-raising sim.
3310176	3313458	Wait, did you say baby-raising or baby-racing?
3314779	3316800	Oh my god, a baby-racing game?
3316820	3317481	That would be awesome.
3317501	3319662	A baby-racing game would be hardcore.
3319722	3321464	I'd buy that shit.
3322464	3323725	Developers, are you listening?
3323925	3324806	Baby-racing.
3324846	3325646	More babies!
3326587	3327948	Babies versus kittens.
3329048	3329629	Who will win?
3330427	3332528	Anyways, Cabela's Monster Bass.
3332688	3334868	It's a bass fishing game on the PlayStation 2.
3335689	3340410	College Hoops 2K8 is coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360 this week.
3341550	3343171	CSI Dark Motives.
3344551	3346412	CSI game on the DS.
3346712	3347712	Apparently a venture game.
3348152	3348693	Kind of crappy.
3349873	3351753	The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific.
3352254	3355154	Another piece of shovelware on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3.
3356075	3357355	Did you call that shovelware?
3357535	3357735	Yeah.
3357895	3358495	What does that mean?
3358656	3360056	It means it's crap.
3360516	3362137	Oh, anyways.
3363097	3366298	No, actually, it's on PlayStation 2 this week because the other games got delayed.
3368478	3370619	Imagine Fashion Designer on the PC.
3371359	3373100	Yes, you too can design crap.
3374240	3375400	Mario Party DS.
3375840	3377781	That's going to be a good game, so pick that one up.
3378741	3380522	Medal of Honor Airborne for the PlayStation 3.
3380842	3382142	I guess better late than never.
3383542	3384623	Monster Jam on the Wii.
3384803	3385483	Same there.
3386872	3390795	Let's see... Time Crisis 4, which is including the Gun Con.
3391496	3393117	That's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 3.
3393337	3395239	So it might be worth picking up if you like gun games.
3396340	3398561	Unreal Tournament 3, coming out on PC.
3399282	3400343	So that should be pretty awesome.
3400523	3402304	No word on the PlayStation 3 version yet.
3403706	3407969	Let's see... World of Warcraft, March of the Legion.
3408389	3409270	You know, the card game.
3410331	3412753	I don't know if anyone's interested in the World of Warcraft card game.
3414294	3415115	Let's see here...
3418930	3424395	Soldier of Fortune Payback on the PlayStation 3 actually got delayed to this week, which I thought was kind of interesting.
3426037	3428699	AMF Bowling Pinbusters on the Wii.
3429180	3431001	I don't know if this is a good game or not, but it's only $20.
3432403	3438088	So if you like bowling and you're a little tired of Wii Sports bowling, you might want to check that out.
3439251	3460023	Then finally, Final Fantasy Online, they have the Vanadil Collection 2008 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, which is going to include, of course, all the previous expansions, the original game, and of course, the other thing that's coming out this week, the Final Fantasy XI Online Wings of the Goddess expansion, which should make some people happy.
3461184	3461604	Yay!
3463105	3463805	Let's see then.
3464166	3466047	Oh, and that's also coming on PC as well.
3466947	3467708	Then on...
3469722	3472744	on the DS, John Deere, Harvest in the Heartland.
3473664	3476086	It's a farming sim for real.
3477787	3479247	Take that, Harvest Moon.
3480308	3482809	Luxor Pharaoh's Challenge on PlayStation 2.
3484070	3484971	That'll probably suck.
3487492	3489893	Ghost Squad on the Wii, which I highly recommend you pick up.
3490434	3494756	That's only $29.99, so definitely a great gun game for the Wii.
3495497	3497738	And also uses the Wii Zapper, which is also coming out this week.
3499022	3501985	Soul Calibur Legends, which I heard sucked, has come out on the Wii.
3502725	3510812	Rock Band, of course, probably the biggest game this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, both the special edition and the game only.
3511653	3514695	And then Showtime Boxing on the Wii also sucked.
3515075	3518819	Star Trek Conquest on PlayStation 2 also sucked.
3520120	3524103	Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake, probably also sucks.
3525704	3528026	Final Fantasy XII, Revenant Wings, that game sucked.
3528305	3529546	Pretty good on the DS.
3530407	3532870	Godzilla Unleashed also sucked.
3533971	3539497	And I believe that is it.
3541900	3543641	And you said there's not a lot coming out this week.
3543681	3544843	Come on, that took like five minutes.
3545423	3546224	That's because I'm slow.
3546725	3546985	All right.
3547383	3548264	Wings of the Goddess
3566246	3571950	Anyhow, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally makes its way to the Xbox 360 as well this week in Japan.
3572410	3577393	Also coming out, Medal of Honor Airborne, also for the 360, and another 360 game.
3577693	3579934	And you didn't think there was anything for the 360 in Japan.
3580015	3583517	Winning Eleven 2008 makes its way to Japan.
3584197	3588440	Coming to the Wii this week in Japan, Dragon Blade comes out.
3589100	3591442	This is from D3, is publishing this.
3593443	3595304	Yep, looks like another role-playing game.
3595976	3597476	It's an action game like God of War.
3597496	3601217	It's a rip-off of God of War, but it's not even close to being as good as God of War.
3601377	3605259	Interesting, because from the box art and everything, it looks like your typical RPG, but there you have it.
3605719	3610220	Mario & Sonic at the Olympics makes its way to Japan, also on the Wii this week, the 22nd.
3610820	3615341	Coming out on PlayStation 3, another version of Harry Potter, because of course those games come out on every console.
3615821	3623043	Also, Remi no Oishi Restaurant, which you know better on these shores as Ratatouille.
3623664	3625284	That movie, Ratatouille, whatever.
3626298	3627919	PlayStation 2 Princess Osagasi
3655069	3655449	Dragon Quest IV
3680199	3680579	Dragon Quest IV
3706724	3715949	Uno Ikusi, IQ Breeder is coming out, and it looks like something between a dog sim and a brain training game.
3716209	3716849	So that's great.
3716949	3721011	Take your two biggest DS games, cram them together, and you have this game.
3722452	3722832	Lovely.
3723393	3725414	Maybe it's where you beat the dog until it's smart.
3726894	3727915	I somehow doubt that.
3728795	3728976	Aw.
3729236	3731437	All right, there it is, your Japanese releases.
3731497	3732497	P-p-p-puppies.
3733658	3735499	Okay, well, there's a crap load of stuff coming out in the U.K.,
3736622	3740024	On the 22nd, we have Final Fantasy XI, Wings of the Goddess.
3740664	3741144	Yay.
3742625	3746186	Smarty Pants on Wii.
3746366	3749628	23rd, Ace Combat 6, Fires of Liberation, which actually is not all that great.
3750088	3751429	I will tell you that from experience.
3753390	3759432	Beowulf, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II, Code Lyoko, I guess.
3760773	3762854	CSI, Crime Scene Investigation, Hard Evidence.
3763833	3781787	Dewey's Adventure, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock on a bunch of stuff, Jackass the Game, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, Kane and Lynch, Deadman, Lair, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, Mass Effect, Medal of Honor Heroes 2, My Horse and Me.
3782367	3783688	I just think that's a funny name.
3783908	3786450	Oh, how can I forget Mass Effect?
3788852	3789753	Boo Loki.
3790273	3791174	Boo you, whatever.
3793816	3808899	NBA 2K8, Need for Speed Pro Street, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance, Siphon Filter, Logan Shadow, Time Crisis 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Warhammer 40K, Squad Command.
3808959	3809860	I hate Warhammer.
3811820	3813760	Oh, we got some stories in there you'll like later.
3814541	3814941	Is that it?
3815901	3816121	Yeah.
3816361	3816521	Wow.
3817588	3820549	You just threw that mic down at the mere mention of Warhammer.
3820569	3822569	The fuck is Warhammer shit?
3822669	3826030	I have bad memories of Warhammer.
3827411	3827871	Do share.
3828571	3831632	I dated a guy who was a Warhammer player and all he did was play Warhammer.
3832852	3838554	Replace Warhammer with World of Warcraft and you have a lot of relationships in this day and age.
3838834	3841215	He would spend hours painting his stupid little models.
3841835	3846296	And where the stupid little models were kind of cool, I was like, dude, you are too obsessed with this shit.
3846883	3850167	I got too bored with painting the models, so I just, you know.
3852810	3853651	The models suck.
3853671	3855873	They're like a few millimeters tall.
3855933	3857755	It's like, fuck, I can't paint this shit.
3858396	3860418	My dog ended up eating a lot of them anyways.
3861519	3862280	So, wow.
3862921	3863702	But they were cool.
3864222	3864883	Yeah, for a while.
3865410	3871772	Anyways, one thing that's also cool, although it's a little late for it about now, is a new Terminator game.
3871952	3875873	Yes, Halcon is adapting Terminator for a brand new game.
3876053	3879594	Hopefully it's not based off the new Terminator series, which I'm sure is going to blow.
3880914	3881734	I'm sure tons.
3881754	3889996	I was just going to say this Terminator thing comes just in time for the Sarah Connor Chronicles, which I'm sure tons of people will be watching this winter on Fox during the writer's strike.
3890296	3893057	Yes, Sarah Connor Chronicles.
3893948	3895070	It's fucking emo shit, just like goddamn, um...
3911997	3930884	was it Smallville or something like that where they just there's Terminators coming after me it's like seriously they're just going to keep coming after you until you die so get used to it it also has the you better not make my character gay kid from Heroes in it who was then written out of the show remember that the management was like
3931511	3931952	and DarkSakura.
3955782	3959847	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3968325	3971386	Terminator Salvation The Future Begins Lame!
3971766	3972966	But that's going to be coming out later.
3973326	3977667	I love this comment from Odd1 in our chat room, who's making a lot of win comments tonight.
3977707	3978068	Good job.
3978688	3981088	Odd1 says, Terminator without the Terminator.
3981448	3981768	Great.
3982109	3987150	Next up, Star Wars without lightsabers and Doctor Who based in South Central LA.
3989871	3990391	There you have it.
3992571	3993772	Doctor Who-ed.
3994472	3995232	Doctor Who-ed.
3996522	3997403	That's not funny.
3998003	3998524	Yes, it is.
3998544	3999204	You're smiling.
3999685	4003287	By the way, did you know I have to play Doctor Who this weekend at the show?
4003427	4005289	I need to go out and buy some Converse this weekend.
4005989	4007110	It kept going back and forth.
4007170	4009152	I was going to be Professor X, not Doctor Who.
4009192	4011714	Go to Payless and get Airwalks.
4011734	4012415	They're more comfortable.
4012675	4013015	We'll see.
4014056	4014736	All right, anyhow.
4018199	4019220	I just think the Terminator...
4020411	4033916	Seriously, it's like, I know why they announced that they're making a new Terminator game to kind of build off the hype of other announcements out there, but I mean, how can you get excited about a game that's going to come out for like two years about the Terminator?
4034216	4039217	Unless fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be back into it, which he's not because he's in the fucking political game now.
4040698	4040978	I don't know.
4041840	4042681	I just can't get all excited.
4042781	4049566	I mean, seriously, what good Terminator games have there been out there, excluding Terminator the arcade game, which was Terminator 2 the arcade game.
4049586	4051308	I was going to say Terminator 2 the arcade game.
4051368	4054871	Which was okay as a gun game, but really it wasn't that great.
4056874	4057514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4080149	4085574	Which is, you know, if you've listened to this game for any length of time, you know I have a lot of love for the very first Civilization game.
4085994	4088416	And the others that have come out since then have kind of turned me off.
4088796	4090838	And for that, I never touched Civ IV.
4091158	4094021	But I need to go give it a try now, because I have been playing GameTap.
4094541	4095662	I definitely want to go check that out.
4096563	4097824	The other ones are just too complicated.
4097864	4099986	I like my Civ Simple, which Civ I was.
4100606	4105370	So, anyhow, for the record, when the service started, there were only 300 games available on it.
4105831	4107172	Now there are a thousand.
4107785	4114691	So on GameTap.com is the information on all the games that are on the service, plus this interesting little picture.
4116572	4119335	You know those big pictures that are made up of little pictures?
4119875	4120556	They have one of those.
4120756	4121717	A mosaic?
4122037	4122898	Thank you, a mosaic.
4122998	4123799	The word escaped me.
4124699	4129583	They have that, but you can do a mouseover on all the little box arts and see what games they are.
4130644	4132046	Yay, box arts!
4133787	4135148	That's exactly what I said.
4135208	4136069	Yay, box arts.
4137355	4140536	DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week
4166533	4167834	The Guardian Legend The Guardian Legend
4188716	4194001	And, um, it starts off as a shooter, and then it's like an adventure RPG sort of thing.
4194522	4198005	And you talk to these little guys called Blue Landers, who look a lot like Lolo.
4199787	4206334	And, um, it's basically as you're going through it, you know, you have to pick up your power-ups, you actually, um...
4207498	4212941	As your score goes up, you earn different other power-ups and more chips.
4212961	4215323	This is how your power-ups are stored.
4215663	4220385	And then you earn more life, too, as you go through the game until you're the super-powered badass.
4222727	4224548	There were a couple of neat glitches in the game.
4225088	4231652	One of them where if you had a barrier up the middle, if you held diagonally, you could actually walk through the barrier.
4232577	4232817	DarkSakura,
4263008	4267350	I'm glad you didn't use this one video file that I linked you to because that person could not play the first level for shit.
4268931	4269131	No.
4269672	4272113	I did my own searching around YouTube to find this clip.
4272513	4273113	It's a little better.
4273594	4276615	So here's some overworld music, and then I'm going to switch to Jamie's favorite song in the game.
4277556	4277856	Yeah.
4278836	4279857	Play a little bit of it.
4282338	4289362	The one cool thing about this is, for anyone who doesn't know too much about it, the original game was actually on the MSX called Gartic.
4290544	4294886	And this is actually the sequel to that, Guarded Gaiden, which was what it was called in Japan.
4298328	4303830	It was also put out by Compile that gave us a bunch of really, really cool games.
4304490	4311474	Actually, another one of my favorite shooters was Robo Aleste, which is, you know, they just did a whole crap ton of shooters.
4314235	4316716	This is somebody shooting the gun repeatedly to open the corridor.
4316836	4318737	Because every corridor had its own little trick to open it.
4320489	4321190	Let me actually switch.
4321210	4325913	I'm going to switch to the music that Jamie says is her favorite in the game, which is the music to Corridor No.
4325933	4325913	6.
4325953	4328214	Here's the overworld music after that.
4328855	4329555	Oh, it's the overworld music.
4329615	4330296	The overworld music.
4330316	4330536	Yeah.
4330556	4333418	Well, this music's good, too.
4333998	4336280	I like this one, too, but the overworld music was my favorite.
4336300	4336720	Go ahead.
4336740	4338181	I'll skip ahead a little bit in the video.
4338842	4339302	Not that one.
4340783	4341264	Well, damn it.
4341464	4342184	It was right before that.
4342204	4342865	It was right before this?
4346467	4347348	I think it's right after here.
4348735	4349896	That's the destruction of Corridor 15.
4373069	4374491	You know, I love this game.
4374531	4375632	There's no easy way to say it.
4375712	4377053	I don't know what it is about this game.
4377093	4382359	I think it's the fact that it's like a little bit of everything, which for the ADD gamer like me is wonderful.
4382779	4385082	And like, I don't know like...
4386101	4389142	What we have to do to get a sequel to this game that doesn't suck.
4389242	4400404	I realize there might be licensing issues and who owns the works and such and such, but my god, I beg you, if you're out there and you have the power to make a sequel to this game happen that doesn't suck, please do.
4400424	4402824	What would technically be the third in the trilogy, then?
4402904	4407665	I guess that's true, because you do count Guardic, but Guardic, it's not nearly as memorable as this game.
4407765	4409965	If you've seen Guardic, it's not that exciting.
4410626	4412226	This really took it to a whole new level.
4412446	4412826	Well, um...
4414033	4420636	There is actually another glitch in the game, and I had actually remembered this because I had a glitched copy, my very first one was.
4420817	4426419	If you got your score to 10 million points, the game would crash and you couldn't play anymore.
4427600	4432242	So the later releases would only let you go up to a maximum score of 9,999,990, because the points were all multiples of 10.
4437194	4444898	and for anyone who's a big fan of the Compile games, the Blue Lander is actually one of their mascots and was also in the Sega Master System game called Govelius.
4446819	4447099	Nice.
4447139	4447799	So there you go.
4448400	4450501	Yes, it was not made by Square, chat room.
4450521	4454002	This is made by Compile, published by Broderbund here in the U.S.
4454082	4454263	Yep.
4454663	4455303	So there you have it.
4455963	4461026	And because none of those companies exist anymore, that's why it's sadly unlikely we're going to see this, but...
4461869	4471011	Possibly this game could make its way to Virtual Console only based on the fact that Lode Runner was also a Broderbund game and that did come out on Virtual Console for TurboGrafx.
4471531	4472311	So you never know.
4472411	4473791	Nothing is impossible, I suppose.
4474651	4479172	But this is one of my... Not only does Jamie love this game, I do too.
4479192	4482013	I don't know how Loki feels about it, but he better like it or he's fired.
4482813	4483353	So there you go.
4485653	4487214	Classic game of the week, Guardian Legend.
4488374	4488754	Well done.
