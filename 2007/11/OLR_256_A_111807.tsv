0	21240	Today, November 18th, 2007, Xbox 360 is getting its own virtual console of sorts, Divx is
21240	31920	coming to PlayStation 3, and is Nintendo DS redesign on its way next year?
31920	35240	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35240	36240	Radio.
36240	40120	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
40120	41640	and the gamer lifestyle.
41640	46520	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, the co-hosts that make this shiz happen, say
46520	48600	hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48600	51760	And Rob gave me chocolate that has booze in it.
51760	56800	I hate to say it, but they didn't card me for it, so the alcohol is presumably cooked
56800	57800	out of the Malibu chocolate.
57800	60640	I'm pretty sure of it, but I still think that it's very, very tasty.
60640	62760	I've had some that has lots of alcohol in it though.
62760	63760	That's cool.
63760	64760	I want that.
64760	65760	No bears.
65760	69960	The ones that had the Grand Marnier in it, and they also had Johnny Walker.
69960	71360	I have not heard of this.
71360	72360	This sounds yummy.
72360	74800	I'll have to find out where Julie got them from, but they do card you for those.
74800	75800	I think you should do that now.
75800	76800	No.
76800	77800	Maybe you can get them at BevMo.
77800	79240	I bet you could.
79240	80240	All right.
80240	82080	Say hello as well to the one and only Loki.
82080	83080	Hello.
83080	85080	How are you doing, Loki?
85080	86880	I'm okay other than a headache.
86880	88520	Oh, I'm sorry to hear you have a headache.
88520	89520	Do you need some Tylenol?
89520	90520	No, I already took some.
90520	91520	Ibuprofen?
91520	92520	Hammer?
92520	94520	I already took stuff.
94520	99040	By the way, for the lovely folks watching our webcam feed on Operator 11, you can see
99040	100040	Loki's shirt.
100040	102040	Didn't you get this at Fonamy when we were in your life?
102040	103040	Yeah, I got this at Fonamy.
103040	105840	Grand Theft Amish, Penn State Dutch.
105840	106840	Lovely.
106840	109400	Very nice shirt there.
109400	110400	Nerd.
110400	111600	All right.
111600	113600	Let's get into the show tonight.
113600	115880	We'll start it off as we always do.
115880	118440	You notice this is episode 256, though, I must say.
118440	119800	That is kind of a landmark number.
119800	120800	You know why?
120800	127800	Well, not only is like two to a certain power, 256, but also that's one color for every color
127800	130280	in a VGA monitor.
130280	131280	Impressive, no?
131280	134280	You're a geek.
134280	135880	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
135880	137760	I played shit.
137760	138760	Did you now?
138760	141160	But I'm trying to remember what exactly I played.
141160	142160	Oh, yeah.
142160	143160	I played the After Burner.
143160	144160	What was it?
144160	145160	The After Burner arcade game.
145160	146160	Yeah.
146160	147160	No, it was the new one.
147160	150200	The name's on my stupid iPhone.
150200	152320	Jamie and I went on a double date this week.
152320	153320	Sort of.
153320	159680	Yeah, Dan came, too, and we played a bunch of ticket games at that John's Not Very Amazing
159680	160680	Pizza or Incredible.
160680	164600	It's John's Incredible Pizza, but we now call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is what
164600	165600	it's called.
165600	168600	I love it, but it's the new After Burner that came out, what, a year ago?
168600	169600	It looked pretty rad.
169600	170600	I didn't even know it was there.
170600	175120	It's really, really cool, and we played a bunch of that, and I went on this Twister
175120	176120	thing.
176120	177120	The ride.
177120	178120	Oh, my God.
178120	179120	William was so funny.
179120	184680	A big hello to the person that worked there, Chris, who stopped us and was like, you're
184680	186240	the guy from Horizontal Radio, huh?
186240	187240	That was kind of cool.
187240	189640	I was like, I need to write this thing first.
189640	190640	Ego++.
190640	191640	What?
191640	192640	Level up.
192640	195640	He was recognized from the show by some guy who worked there.
195640	196920	It was pretty awesome.
196920	199840	So he recognized me because Dark Soccer was on the ride, and then I was like, oh, you
199840	200840	got to go meet Janie's mom.
200840	202160	Well, she's never on camera anyways, so I mean...
202160	203160	That's true.
203160	206000	You're not on Op 11, so they don't know what you look like, but she's in the album art,
206000	209080	so I'm sure if they've done their homework, they know, and she's on the All Games page.
209080	210080	There's a picture and all that stuff.
210080	211720	And I've got pictures of me on my Myspace.
211720	212720	Yeah, that's right.
212720	215140	Because I take them with my own camera.
215140	216140	That was awesome.
216140	217140	Of myself.
217140	221280	Sadly, I was not able to get free things from the ticket counter because William wanted
221280	226480	one of those... It was something really fruity, like a princess backpack or something stupid
226480	228240	just to make me buy it for him.
228240	230880	I don't think it was so much that he probably wanted it, but he wanted me to buy it for
230880	231880	him with hardware tickets.
231880	233960	I wanted the Rock'em Sock'em robots.
233960	234960	Those are cool.
234960	237920	I wanted the little mini pinball game because I'm not cool like Janie, and I have 20 pinball
237920	238920	machines in my house.
238920	239920	Oh, yeah.
239920	240920	We traded out one of our pinballs.
240920	245000	We're actually holding some pinball machines for a friend, and so we got rid of Time Machine,
245000	248880	which made me sad, but we have a Black Knight now, not Black Knight 2000, but the old Black
248880	250880	Knight, which is still a cool table.
250880	251880	Oh, sorry.
251880	252880	Go ahead.
252880	253880	Go ahead.
253880	257480	I was going to say, I'd like to mention, I'm posting a link in the chat room right now,
257480	262600	which apparently I noticed my t-shirt had a web URL on it, so this is where you can
262600	263600	find it.
263600	267040	I had to go through a few links, but this guy has some other wonderful shirts, including
267040	274100	one that's a spoof of the Clerks shirt, or I guess box art from the movie, Clerks.
274100	278840	It says, just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.
278840	282440	I think that's the same place I got my shirt that's the parody of the movie 300 that has
282440	283440	that one guy's face on it.
283440	284920	It says, this is Zelda.
284920	292120	It might be from some other guy, but he also has another one from, it says, gaming is as
292120	296160	addictive as sex, but there's no orgasm to let you know when to stop.
296160	297720	Wow, that's classy.
297720	298720	Okay.
298720	300920	Back to Jamie's Gaming Week, please.
300920	302200	Loki, Rude.
302200	308520	So I played a lot more Ragnarok, of course, and I had a really nice game of World Cup
308520	316200	Soccer 94, which was a very, very good game, and I actually watched the entire play through
316200	321160	of Portal just because I watched it twice.
321160	322800	Did the cake ever come true?
322800	323800	No.
323800	326080	Sorry to hear it.
326080	331800	But I also, after the show, when I got home last week, because I had a three day weekend,
331800	334560	because I work for a bank.
334560	336000	Whatever.
336000	341480	I was really bored and had bad insomnia, so I completely redid my live journal, and I
341480	348080	now have a Portal theme with a big old lady companion cube on it.
348080	350760	I did watch the YouTube of the poor companion.
350760	353120	It was like a companion cube tribute on YouTube.
353120	354120	Yeah, that was...
354120	355120	People have the dumbest shit on YouTube.
355120	356120	You were laughing though.
356120	357120	I was.
357120	358120	It was funny.
358120	359560	That one part, though, where they played the...
359560	361560	You must now incinerate the cube or whatever.
361560	362560	Oh, yeah, didn't they?
362560	363560	Oh, yeah.
363560	368320	They played the one Imogen Heap song that they always play for every death scene ever
368320	369520	that I've ever seen.
369520	370520	That was great.
370520	374120	Yeah, so the video is like...
374120	375600	It's doing its thing, and it's showing...
375600	380380	It's like a tribute, and I was expecting Journey to come in or something, but then they have
380380	383820	to throw the cube in the incinerator, because that's what you do in one of the missions,
383820	386680	and then suddenly the definitive death song comes in.
386680	394480	No, it's not the companion cube.
394480	399320	And then they kept repeating it and speeding it up.
399320	401320	That was the best ever.
401320	403840	It's just like that.
403840	406880	Forget it, I tried.
406880	407880	iTunes just isn't friendly to do that.
407880	409920	It's just like that one SNL digital short that they have.
409920	410920	It is.
410920	412280	It's a total parody of that one short.
412280	416020	It was just the best thing ever.
416020	417020	But I was just...
417020	420840	Dear sister, thank you Tiger Claw in the chat room, chat.orangelester.com.
420840	421840	But I have...
421840	426260	And I'll try to find the walkthrough I was watching, but I was watching part seven of
426260	430560	the walkthrough, because that's my favorite one, because that's the one where the computer
430560	436640	goes starts going nuts and says, you must lay down in the party retrieval position.
436640	437640	Wow.
437640	438640	All right.
438640	440000	We got to move on.
440000	441240	We don't want to have a portal show tonight.
441240	442240	That was great.
442240	443240	All right.
443240	444240	Loki, how was your gaming week?
444240	445240	My gaming week was okay.
445240	449360	We played Earth Defense Force 2017 again.
449360	456600	We went back to that and actually did pretty well on the Inferno levels.
456600	459160	Hopefully going to try to finish that game eventually.
459160	465720	I tried a little bit of Mass Effect and there's a whole lot of talking in that game.
465720	469740	They really like to just use that.
469740	473480	They're like, man, we made a really cool conversation system.
473480	475480	Let's constantly use it.
475480	478040	It's like, my God, shut the hell up.
478040	480200	I want to go on a mission already.
480200	482320	You have the best game reviews, Loki.
482320	483320	Yeah.
483320	487080	So I play Mass Effect and it's a lot of talking.
487080	488480	It seriously is.
488480	491840	It's just like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
491840	493600	Oh my God.
493600	499680	You're here for some reason that's not good or something and there's something going on.
499680	500680	I wonder what it is.
500680	504800	To this point I'm like, I don't know who you are, nor do I care what's going on.
504800	508600	I just want to go fight something.
508600	511880	When I did go fight something, there were these stupid little flying things that shot
511880	513960	lasers at me.
513960	518760	My guys basically, I had one of my away team members, it must have been Sergeant I'm going
518760	523280	to die or something because fucker just ran up, started shooting at it and just stood
523280	528480	out in the middle of the open instead of taking cover like a smart person and died instantly.
528480	531640	Naturally there's feedback from the chat room here.
531640	535720	Odd One says, Dear God, an RPG where I have to talk to people?
535720	536720	What the hell?
536720	540920	No, but they go on and on and on and on and on.
540920	544100	I actually was skimming through it.
544100	548440	If I wanted to talk to everybody, I could do that as well and it's just, huh.
548440	552760	SSJ100Matt in chat.orangelshooter.com says, They spent a lot on voice actors, Loki.
552760	553760	They got to use them.
553760	554760	Oh yeah, true.
554760	555760	But no, they got me wrong.
555760	561120	Dr. Uno invokes Elvis and says, A little more conversation, or no, a little less conversation,
561120	562600	a little more action please.
562600	563600	Get it?
563600	564600	Get it?
564600	571760	I mean, but to be fair, I played this game during a lunch, only half of a lunch, so about
571760	572960	30 minutes.
572960	578000	But dude, it took me 25 minutes to actually see some action in this game.
578000	579000	That's pretty bad.
579000	583840	But hey, it's going to be pretty cool, so I'm looking forward to playing a little more
583840	589360	of the game when I stop playing other games, which one of those other games, of course,
589360	594080	would be Rock Band.
594080	599720	I don't want to sound like a fanboy for Rock Band because I bought Guitar Hero 2 a long
599720	604000	time ago and didn't play that much of it.
604000	607800	Rock Band, though, has actually got me excited about music games again.
607800	609000	It's worth playing.
609000	610000	I like it.
610000	611000	I think it's pretty fun.
611000	612440	That's a big fucking statement there.
612440	617880	I mean, I'm actually working my way through the game on starting on easy and kind of building
617880	621560	up from there, but it's pretty awesome.
621560	626760	The equipment that comes with it, the controllers and stuff, they look quality.
626760	629200	Let me put it this way.
629200	634280	I know they still are kind of like toys, but they look a lot less like toys than, say,
634280	640760	the Guitar Hero controllers, which look like fucking KB toy shit, because you put them
640760	642920	side by side and you're like, oh my god.
642920	645720	I was actually playing on that one time.
645720	650000	The drums are good, although I cannot play drums in the house anymore because my wife
650000	651960	has told me not to because it's too loud.
651960	655160	They are very loud, those drums.
655160	656160	It's fun.
656160	658400	I really like the drums in the game.
658400	663000	I have not touched the vocal part of the game yet, but the microphone that comes with it
663000	664000	is really nice.
664000	669080	I hear, though, you can use any USB microphone and it will work just fine.
669080	673760	Also, I hear the rumor about the Guitar Hero 3 controllers not working in the game is false.
673760	677640	They do work in the game.
677640	680960	I was going to say, that's what they were using for the demo unit at the Best Buy near
680960	684200	my house.
684200	687440	I had known I had seen them before somewhere.
687440	689920	But I like the guitars that came with the Rock Band game.
689920	690920	Those are nice guitars.
690920	691920	They are nice.
691920	692920	They are really nice.
692920	694560	The drums are pretty cool.
694560	697280	They get put together pretty fast.
697280	702920	I'm still having trouble coordinating both the drums and the kick drum, but I have that
702920	706920	problem with drum mania as well.
706920	711160	But compared to the drum mania home game, this thing, once again, looks less like a
711160	712160	toy.
712160	714280	Can I bring the box in here for the OP11 people?
714280	715280	Nothing is huge.
715280	717960	I want to show the people how epic it is.
717960	719080	Keep talking about your game week.
719080	723080	By the way, for those folks on OP11, after tonight's program, we're going to be back
723080	724080	going live.
724080	727000	We'll actually show you Rock Band and everything that's in it and play the game a little bit.
727000	728280	Loki is sworn up and down though.
728280	729280	He won't sing though.
729280	732240	We'll try our best.
732240	735400	One of the other things that's neat about the game is you can actually create your own
735400	736400	character in it.
736400	740040	I know that sounds stupid, but you actually want to play the game more so you unlock more
740040	743320	money so that you can buy more things for your character.
743320	747080	It's funny because I actually created a guy that's my guitarist because apparently you
747080	750800	can't use the same character for everything.
750800	754960	That box is fucking huge, I must say.
754960	758280	When I saw that, I'm like, holy crap, that thing is huge.
758280	761240	It's a good 20 pounds when it's full of all the equipment.
761240	764440	It's a big, big box, and it's not even full right now.
764440	765440	That makes sense though.
765440	766440	Yeah, I know.
766440	770400	The other bad thing about it, and I had to cut a hole in the side of that box because
770400	774280	right now I'm using up the carry stuff back and forth, is once you put the guitar together
774280	779280	because the little top part snaps on, it doesn't fit in the box anymore, so I had to cut a
779280	782760	hole in the box for the guitar.
782760	788040	You can create your own characters, I actually created an emo goth guy called Azrael for
788040	795320	my guitarist because that's what I was trying to do, but you couldn't fit Azrael the best
795320	799480	Prince of Sorrow in there, so I just had to stick with Azrael.
799480	805360	It's pretty cool though, he looks kind of neat now.
805360	815480	My main character, Loki, who's playing drums, has the Dr. Who jacket, which is kind of neat.
815480	819640	There's a lot of things though, like one of the guitars in the game is actually a chainsaw,
819640	824920	which is kind of neat, and then you can create probably a lot of characters that look like
824920	829260	Sephiroth or Vincent and stuff, because there's a lot of outfits that look like you could
829260	831120	make characters that look like other things.
831120	836680	I loved the way that the custom characters interface themselves so well into the flow
836680	838800	of the game.
838800	842040	They look like they're in pre-rendered movies.
842040	848140	In the game, their mouths are synced up with the lyrics and everything, their plane is
848140	853520	synced up with the song, so they're not just fake strumming of the guitar and stuff, it's
853520	858400	actually synced up with the song, and the drummer actually drums to the song, so it's
858400	860160	pretty realistic.
860160	863520	I like the film grainy design.
863520	868120	I think that's how they get away with it, because I think by using that grainy film
868120	870360	thing, they're not doing it as high of a resolution as you think.
870360	873520	I think that's their way of getting around it, but it works.
873520	877460	Hats off to them for finding a cheap trick that works.
877460	882420	But it is funny, they're watching this really emo-looking guy singing Timmy and the Lords
882420	886280	of the Underworld.
886280	888820	Freeze pop song, A++.
888820	889820	It's a pretty cool game.
889820	894120	They unlock the tracks pretty easy too, they have a bonus little venue that you play that
894120	899320	unlocks all the unlockable tracks, but in order to be able to play the songs in practice
899320	901240	mode or whatever, you have to play them through the game.
901240	906840	I don't know, it's pretty nice, but I really recommend picking it up if you can find it,
906840	909160	I just know they're going to be really hard to find.
909160	913180	But if you can't find the game with all the instruments, and you don't really care about
913180	916920	drums too much, you can always pick up a USB microphone and just use your normal Guitar
916920	920080	Hero guitar with the game only, and save yourself some money that way.
920080	922080	I'll tell you right now where to get Rock Band.
922080	930080	If you go there the morning of the 20th, Tuesday when it comes out, Kmart, no one shops Kmart.
930080	934200	They might not be getting that many though, see that's the thing, everyone's allocations
934200	939000	are cut, so go to Best Buy or something like that if you can.
939000	944680	Anything else for your gaming week?
944680	948840	My gaming week, not too incredibly exciting because I've been going back and forth between
948840	951600	Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I've been playing both.
951600	959680	I got my Corsair up to level 19 in Final Fantasy XI, and World of Warcraft, the 2.3 patch came
959680	962880	out, so I've just been trying to get used to all the changes with that, but I've got
962880	967560	to say they did a lot of really good subtle things that are great.
967560	970400	For instance, you know how there were fetch quests?
970400	974600	Go around and collect the weeds, or go around and find the empty boxes.
974600	978720	Sometimes you would have to wave your mouse around the screen until it turns that little
978720	980920	gear icon so you could find where the things are.
980920	984200	Now those items sparkle when you're on the quest, so it makes it a lot easier to see,
984200	985200	which is cool.
985200	986720	Little subtle things like that are neat.
986720	990320	When you're looking at the map and you get attacked, the screen flashes red, so you know
990320	991560	you're being beat up.
991560	994680	It's cool, good times.
994680	997920	The patch was very cool, and Final Fantasy XI, I'm just looking forward to the Wings
997920	1001760	of the Goddess expansion because Dancer sounds awesome.
1001760	1005440	I never thought I'd say that, but Dancer, it's a battle healer.
1005440	1006440	How cool is that?
1006440	1008520	Dancers are battle healers.
1008520	1009960	Scholars seems kind of interesting too.
1009960	1012080	That's sort of how dancers are in Ragnarok.
1012080	1018040	Yes, and I think in the, well no, because in Tactics they were just female bards.
1018040	1019040	They were more buffers.
1019040	1023840	Oh yeah, they do more buffing, but they have like range healing and stuff like that.
1023840	1027080	That's exactly how they made them in Final Fantasy XI, is that they're kind of like buffers,
1027080	1031720	but with that range healing, but yet they can provoke the monster and they're like tanks.
1031720	1032720	It's crazy.
1032720	1033720	That's interesting.
1033720	1034720	Do they dance, fight?
1034720	1037600	They just shake their ass.
1037600	1038960	You can be a Galka dancer.
1038960	1040840	There's videos on YouTube of the Galka dances.
1040840	1042280	It's awesome.
1042280	1046560	You use your TP to do attacks, but the thing is, it's like the first job I can think of
1046560	1050400	where you don't have to have 100% TP to do the special attacks, there's scenes you can
1050400	1054680	do with like 30 TP or 60, and TP is the stuff you build up as you attack.
1054680	1056000	It's toilet paper.
1056000	1057720	Not that kind of TP, not for your bunk hole.
1057720	1060160	You throw your toilet paper at them.
1060160	1062360	But then they do little jigs.
1062360	1063360	It's cute.
1063360	1064480	I also forgot, if you don't mind.
1064480	1065480	I'm sure.
1065480	1067480	I did make the guild for Ragnarok.
1067480	1072240	I would like to congratulate Ranma as being our first member.
1072240	1074200	Congrats.
1074200	1078880	And the guild is just Orange Lounge Radio.
1078880	1079880	Very cool.
1079880	1080880	So look for the icon.
1080880	1081880	Check that out.
1081880	1082880	All right.
1082880	1085120	I'll have to show you the YouTube edge of the Galka dances later.
1085120	1086120	I have to see that.
1086120	1090720	Op 11 is slowing down our stream a little bit because we're doing too much bandwidth.
1090720	1092000	I can't handle it.
1092000	1093000	What else did I play?
1093000	1097480	Really quickly, I played that new word searching game on Xbox 360, just the demo.
1097480	1101680	I was a little disappointed that it's just basically an over-glorified word search game.
1101680	1103960	Just kind of seems like a casual game.
1103960	1107000	Something that Mom might like, I don't know.
1107000	1111160	Mutant Storm Empire, though, much improved over the first Mutant Storm.
1111160	1112960	I think I need to go back and buy that one.
1112960	1117920	I think the greatest change they made to it is that they made levels feel more like levels
1117920	1122680	where it's almost like Smash TV kind of where you're walking through from room to room,
1122680	1126280	and it doesn't have that really slow loading time transition between the different rooms.
1126280	1130720	Did you download the free Carcassone?
1130720	1131720	Carcassone?
1131720	1132720	Carcassone.
1132720	1134840	Carcassone is something you cook for dinner, I think.
1134840	1135840	Carcassone.
1135840	1136840	Carcassone.
1136840	1138840	Carcassone, I already had it.
1138840	1139840	I got ripped off.
1139840	1146400	I bought Carcassone like two months ago, not when it was first out, but about a month after
1146400	1150440	it was first out I bought Carcassone, so I was kind of pissed when I heard that it was
1150440	1151440	out for free.
1151440	1152440	But what can you do?
1152440	1154720	That kind of stuff happens.
1154720	1156520	That's pretty much it.
1156520	1160160	Pika Uno played Screwjumper and said it sucks balls.
1160160	1163360	Oh yeah, this week's releases kind of suck balls.
1163360	1166960	All I heard is that Pika Uno beat my Boom Boom Rocket score, so I know what game I got
1166960	1168320	to play this week.
1168320	1170480	And maybe, maybe I will use the guitar.
1170480	1174560	You know what we have to do, Rob, what we didn't do last week?
1174560	1175560	Metroid!
1175560	1176560	We haven't done the play for the past three months.
1176560	1181640	And I'm leaving on Thursday, so we'll have to do it like early this week.
1181640	1182640	Soon.
1182640	1186240	I don't work Thursday and Friday, thankfully, but you're like, oh, I'm going to leave.
1186240	1191120	I'm leaving midnight, like when it turns midnight.
1191120	1193200	So we'll have to do it on Tuesday.
1193200	1198840	Well, let's get into some housekeeping, speaking of Jamie leaving.
1198840	1202760	Jamie will be on vacation for the next two weeks from the show, so she's not going to
1202760	1204440	be here next week or the week after.
1204440	1205440	Cry.
1205440	1206440	How dare she.
1206440	1207440	But Rob!
1207440	1208440	What?
1208440	1209440	Fried chicken.
1209440	1211160	Maybe she'll bless us with her presence via the telephone.
1211160	1212160	Who knows?
1212160	1213160	Maybe.
1213160	1214160	We'll see.
1214160	1216460	You know, monkeys might, never mind.
1216460	1220980	I don't know if we'll have somebody else here or if it'll just be the Loki and Rob show.
1220980	1224960	I'm going to try to reach out to Rice Princess so we can have a female perspective of Jamie's
1224960	1225960	absence.
1225960	1226960	I'll have you know.
1226960	1227960	But I don't know if she can make it.
1227960	1228960	I'll have you know, Rob.
1228960	1229960	The Wee Zapper comes out next week.
1229960	1230960	Oh!
1230960	1231960	Oh, I have one.
1231960	1233160	Oh, how'd you do that already?
1233160	1236400	Freebies from the Game Crazy Manager thing.
1236400	1237680	How does that work?
1237680	1239240	What do we have that uses it?
1239240	1242260	But we have one!
1242260	1243260	We have a Wee Zapper.
1243260	1244260	All right.
1244260	1245960	But there's Link's crossbow training.
1245960	1249320	Oh yeah, I didn't care about that.
1249320	1254240	So yeah, the great Loki and Rob challenge with the Wee Zapper might go down in Jamie's
1254240	1255240	absence.
1255240	1256520	You should have Nellie come on the show.
1256520	1258520	Yeah, she doesn't want to.
1258520	1259520	Perhaps.
1259520	1260520	She's got to watch The Desperate Housewives.
1260520	1261520	A little briber.
1261520	1266360	What few episodes are left while the writer's guild's striking?
1266360	1269920	I told Dan to come on the show with me after I get back.
1269920	1270920	You should.
1270920	1271920	Have him do that.
1271920	1272920	Dan on the show is...
1272920	1273920	Comedy.
1273920	1275920	Yeah, it's hilarity.
1275920	1278640	Dan at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza was pretty funny.
1278640	1281440	I think, didn't he coin the phrase John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?
1281440	1282440	No, that was me.
1282440	1283440	That was you.
1283440	1284440	He had another term for it.
1284440	1285440	I don't remember what it was.
1285440	1286440	Incredibly Sucky Pizza.
1286440	1287440	Yeah, John's Incredible World of Suck or something.
1287440	1288440	Yeah.
1288440	1291040	All right, anyway.
1291040	1293000	Our poor friend who works there.
1293000	1298760	Also housekeeping, muy importante, big news, huge, did you hear?
1298760	1303300	It's like all over a lot of podcast sites that you probably listen to.
1303300	1308760	There is now an official Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic on Xbox Live Marketplace.
1308760	1315480	It was part of the Xbox Live 5 celebration because Xbox has turned five years old last
1315480	1322040	week and a shitload of free gamer pics went up, 15 of them all from the AllGames.com family.
1322040	1323160	We are one of those.
1323160	1328800	Big thanks to Afro Guy who kind of like, he made the icons for us initially, but unfortunately
1328800	1330980	when they resized they didn't look right.
1330980	1336200	So Loki kind of took them, took the idea and redid it and did it in this pixel art thing.
1336200	1338640	So it kind of gives it a cool little retro look to it.
1338640	1340320	So it's an OLR gamer pic.
1340320	1342920	Actually that's now our Guild emblem too.
1342920	1346680	And it's actually the emblem for the Guitar Hero 3 band too.
1346680	1347680	So check that out.
1347680	1350120	Good job, Loki, and good job Afro Guy for making the...
1350120	1354640	Although resizing it to 24 by 24 was a pain in the ass.
1354640	1357360	It was, yeah, resizing the picture was horrendous.
1357360	1358360	That's not the size, but...
1358360	1361120	Well, I mean, but that's the size I had to use for Ragnarok.
1361120	1362120	Oh, for Ragnarok.
1362120	1363600	Oh, I thought you meant the gamer pic.
1363600	1364600	No.
1364600	1365600	I was like, oh, oh.
1365600	1366600	All right.
1366600	1367600	So check that out.
1367600	1371040	Please go to the marketplace and look for Community Gamer Picks 2 and check that out.
1371040	1377660	Might I also add there is lots of other great podcasts in Community Gamer Picks 1 and hopefully
1377660	1381520	someday there'll be a Community Gamer Picks 3, but more you guys have to download them
1381520	1386160	and use them and then they go, oh, people like this stuff, so we should get more blogs
1386160	1391680	and more indie shows and that stuff in there, so very cool.
1391680	1395360	Also after tonight's show, I think I already mentioned this, on Operator 11, a special
1395360	1400900	live preview for Rock Band, and last week we did one for Mario Galaxy and the folks
1400900	1405020	in chat really seemed to like that and it was very well received.
1405020	1408740	So I'm hoping we can do more of these in the future in these live preview shows on Sundays
1408740	1410520	and other Op 11 specials.
1410520	1412100	All right.
1412100	1413840	That's all I can think of for housekeeping.
1413840	1416080	If no one else has anything, then we go to...
1416080	1421520	Actually, yeah, because I did get asked a question, just to let you know, my character
1421520	1425520	in Ragnarok that I've got the guild on, her name is Cecily, C-S-S-I-L-Y, if you look
1425520	1430880	for that character, if I'm on it, then you'll find me.
1430880	1435200	So if you want to be added to the guild, I got asked.
1435200	1438440	Also other questions from chat, Mac Man says, Sky, drunk show?
1438440	1442680	No, because I have to work the Monday after the four-day weekend, so not likely, but you
1442680	1448840	never know, stay tuned to the station, you never know when we'll go live randomly.
1448840	1450320	And let's see, what else do we have?
1450320	1451320	I thought there was another one I wanted to see.
1451320	1453680	Oh, Gerardo Mo says, can Loki sing in the preview?
1453680	1454680	I don't know.
1454680	1457440	I don't know, you're going to have to bribe him.
1457440	1460680	I don't know, Loki, what do you think?
1460680	1463320	Could you at least read us some news in a tingle outfit?
1463320	1464320	No.
1464320	1467440	All right, could you at least read us some news?
1467440	1468440	Yeah.
1468440	1476000	Anyways, so there was a big announcement about the fall update, or winter update, I guess,
1476000	1477000	now.
1477000	1482680	Actually, it kind of leaked out first that the Xbox originals are going to be made available
1482680	1483680	to download.
1483680	1489720	What those are basically going to be is just a selection of original Xbox games that you
1489720	1492240	can download straight to your hard drive and play.
1492240	1497360	So this is actually going to be happening, it has been confirmed, and let's see, each
1497360	1504060	one is going to be approximately $15, or 1200 Microsoft points, and will be made available
1504060	1508000	on December 4th as part of the fall update, of course.
1508000	1512720	The first batch of these games, I guess, and I'm not sure if they're all going to be available
1512720	1519600	day one, Halo, Psychonauts, Crimson Skies, and Fable.
1519600	1524320	So those are ones that have been confirmed.
1524320	1531560	There were some other third party ones that were also reported, which were Indigo Prophecy,
1531560	1536440	Crash Bandicoot, Wrath of the Cortex, and Burnout 3, which I thought was a pretty good
1536440	1539400	Burnout game.
1539400	1545160	Let's see here, also as part of the fall update, of course, that Parental Timer, and then who
1545160	1549640	knows what else they'll throw in there as well, but that's mainly the big thing.
1549640	1557320	Although if you're expecting some wonderful things from these Xbox originals, time to
1557320	1563720	kind of calm down a little bit, because they're really just downloadable Xbox games, that's
1563720	1564720	it.
1564720	1567760	I mean, they're emulated through the same software that emulates the current Xbox games
1567760	1572640	that you can just pop a disk in there, so all the bugs that were in those emulations
1572640	1576320	are going to be the same thing on these download titles.
1576320	1580180	So in other words, if you thought Microsoft was going to take the Virtual Console idea
1580180	1582960	and do it better, wrong.
1582960	1589200	Yeah, basically, they're going to have choppiness when the game's loading up.
1589200	1594160	Also if there's content like demos and stuff, selecting them might actually crash the game.
1594160	1599600	You know, stuff that's on these original Xbox games, so it's really just straight port and
1599600	1601720	they're just available to download.
1601720	1604440	No achievements, no nothing.
1604440	1605440	So that's it.
1605440	1608640	It's a little bit of a big deal.
1608640	1612520	But cool news for people that maybe missed it, because there's some people who didn't
1612520	1616080	buy an Xbox One who have an Xbox 360, you know what I mean?
1616080	1617360	So that might be good for them.
1617360	1620640	So I mean, if you're up to it, they will be made available.
1620640	1622560	Obviously this is an optional purchase.
1622560	1628040	You don't necessarily need to buy it, but I don't know.
1628040	1632920	Now our favorite webmaster in the whole wide world, VXJsonXV, brings up a good point and
1632920	1636320	says, but they're on the HD, which means they're fast.
1636320	1641920	HD-based gaming equals heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.
1641920	1642920	That's true, right?
1642920	1645360	If they're on the hard drive, they ought to at least load a little faster, right?
1645360	1650840	Possibly, but then again, they're being emulated, remember, and emulation can be slower sometimes.
1650840	1653560	I guess that's true, but they're being emulated anyway if you put a disk in there.
1653560	1654560	True, yeah.
1654560	1657040	So I guess versus a disk, it would be a little bit faster.
1657040	1660360	But still, I probably wouldn't buy these things if I still have the disk sitting around.
1660360	1661360	Exactly.
1661360	1663720	The other thing too is some of these games are pretty old.
1663720	1667120	You can probably find them really cheap if you really wanted to look for them.
1667120	1670000	Maybe this would be incentive, if they make money off this, maybe this would be incentive
1670000	1675460	for them to go back in the Xbox archive, because they haven't touched the backwards compatibility
1675460	1680600	in a long time and made some more games backwards compatible, like DDR, still not backwards
1680600	1682440	compatible, right?
1682440	1685000	Maybe this would be incentive for them to go dip in the library and make some old stuff
1685000	1686000	backwards compatible.
1686000	1691480	But I swear to God, if they make things like Silent Hill 2 and Silent... Was Silent Hill
1691480	1692480	3 on Xbox?
1692480	1693480	I think it was.
1693480	1694880	I only had 2 and 4, so I don't know.
1694880	1698440	No, I don't think it was, because I was playing it on PS2.
1698440	1703920	But my copies vanished probably when I moved, so I would download that shit in a heartbeat,
1703920	1705720	just to have the load times and stuff.
1705720	1708520	Some of that stuff is going to be cool, I think.
1708520	1709520	We'll see.
1709520	1713120	Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to mention during housekeeping that I totally forgot,
1713120	1718840	because we forgot to note it on our little notes thingy internally here, is that this
1718840	1721240	is great, what's been released from our community.
1721240	1725720	It's on the forums, and it's something called OL Revolution.
1725720	1731400	It's basically a step mania pack with all these songs that are based on inside jokes
1731400	1733000	from the show.
1733000	1738200	There's some completely horrid stuff in there, like five years ago when we would go on the
1738200	1741360	stream randomly and I would sing over DDR songs.
1741360	1745720	People recorded that shit somehow and have stepped it.
1745720	1750240	And some of those god-awful DMN remixes that he's taken, and I say that with love, that
1750240	1754320	he's taken bits and pieces of our show and put them over DDR songs, they're all in there
1754320	1755320	with steps.
1755320	1761200	And then things that are in-jokes to other shows on the station, just hilarious.
1761200	1765660	It's all in the forums, check it out, ask Dark Tetsuya, I think he spearheaded the whole
1765660	1766660	thing.
1766660	1767660	I just think that was very cool.
1767660	1768960	I think this has been, what, two years in the making?
1768960	1774200	It's been a long time in the making, but they even, somebody did the voices, it wasn't us,
1774200	1778080	but I think it was DMN, I don't know, or Travis, I can't tell, because they actually have somebody
1778080	1780800	in the opening going, Orange Lounge Revolution.
1780800	1781800	That's our Tetsuya.
1781800	1782800	Is it really?
1782800	1783800	Yeah, I think so.
1783800	1784800	Oh wow.
1784800	1787800	And they actually have little incidental musics that we use on our station, and some of the
1787800	1790000	shit I don't even know where they found, but they got it.
1790000	1793160	So props to them.
1793160	1797360	But I swear to god, if that shit gets out, that karaoke stuff gets out there too much,
1797360	1798360	I'm gonna have issues.
1798360	1802080	We're gonna have words, Dark Tetsuya, in the parking lot.
1802080	1803080	I'll kick your butt in.
1803080	1806080	Rock Band, which you were talking about a little earlier in the game, and lots and lots
1806080	1810240	of news coming out on Rock Band as the game gets closer and closer to release, including
1810240	1815600	information about the download packs, and Rock Band has decided they've gotta stick
1815600	1820360	it to Guitar Hero 3 by making the packs a little bit cheaper, instead of 500 points
1820360	1824320	for Guitar Hero 3 packs, 440 Microsoft points.
1824320	1828280	That equates to, do the math in your head, $5.49.
1828280	1831760	But you don't just have to buy songs in packs.
1831760	1833960	You can buy individual songs.
1833960	1838400	It could go anywhere from 80 Microsoft points to 240 Microsoft points.
1838400	1841680	That's 99 cents to just under three bucks.
1841680	1846080	Most of them, they say, will be $1.99, 159 Microsoft points.
1846080	1848280	159 Microsoft points?
1848280	1851960	I'm gonna have all these leftover stupid points somewhere.
1851960	1855000	Just do 160.
1855000	1858680	And I mean, they have so much stuff coming out just when the game comes out.
1858680	1863320	They have on November 20th, the Metallica pack, the Police pack, the Queens of the Stone
1863320	1868760	Age pack, and some individual tracks such as My Sharona and Cherry Bomb.
1868760	1872600	I would also like to point out that the week of November 27th, while Jamie is gone and
1872600	1875440	she can't play it, there's a David Bowie pack coming out.
1875440	1876440	Haha.
1876440	1877440	Who says I can't play it?
1877440	1879960	Are you gonna have Rock Band in Alabama?
1879960	1880960	Haha.
1880960	1884400	I really wanna get back.
1884400	1886840	Black Sabbath pack comes out on December 4th.
1886840	1889120	That is so getting downloaded.
1889120	1892520	And December 18th, look at this.
1892520	1893520	Some individual tracks.
1893520	1898800	First, you get a Pretender song, Brass in Pocket, Weezer, Buddy Holly, Just For You,
1898800	1903160	Dark Sakura, God Is Listening, My Iron Lung by Radiohead on December 18th.
1903160	1904160	Yee!
1904160	1905160	There you have it.
1905160	1906160	I loves me some Radiohead.
1906160	1908960	But see, it's kinda cool that they have stuff coming out each week.
1908960	1910480	That is very cool.
1910480	1911480	I hope it continues.
1911480	1914240	I hope it gets stuff on Christmas.
1914240	1915240	We'll see.
1915240	1916520	I don't know.
1916520	1918520	I don't wanna buy like some of these.
1918520	1921000	Fortunate Son actually sounded kinda cool.
1921000	1924520	I like the fact that they have some individual pricing to it as well.
1924520	1925520	That's very cool.
1925520	1927160	Cuz you got, yeah, not all this I'm gonna wanna buy.
1927160	1930000	Like, you know, but, yeah.
1930000	1931000	I'm very happy.
1931000	1938360	Well, for anyone who is looking for these on Guitar Hero 3, there is a free Boss Battle
1938360	1945080	download pack that's basically just the devil went down to Georgia and all the other three,
1945080	1946800	you know, the three Boss Battle songs.
1946800	1948800	So that's pretty cool.
1948800	1951920	But I think that the best part about it is that it's free.
1951920	1952960	I like free.
1952960	1953960	Free is good.
1953960	1956800	So you can play these outside of career mode.
1956800	1957960	Awesome.
1957960	1960040	Anyways, something not...
1960040	1961040	Wait, wait, wait.
1961040	1965080	Yeah, I ran out real quick but I wanted to comment on that.
1965080	1968140	I'm glad they did it for free cuz otherwise we all would have been screaming that it was
1968140	1971720	pay to unlock content because those songs were kind of already in the game.
1971720	1974180	But I think it's a nice little extra.
1974180	1975560	It's nothing huge.
1975560	1978840	But The Devil Went Down to Georgia is an awesome song so I'm really glad they made that available
1978840	1979840	to play whenever I want.
1979840	1980840	I like that cover.
1980840	1981840	Yes.
1981840	1982840	So, good jobs.
1982840	1984840	Okay, now, Loki, you can go.
1984840	1990640	Anyways, so UK retailer Tesco actually slipped up because on their online store they were
1990640	1998320	selling the Xbox 360 holiday bundle which is normally 340 pounds.
1998320	2002480	They were selling it for only 33 pounds.
2002480	2004720	Whoopsie.
2004720	2012300	And apparently it was long enough for a number of customers to order the system and although
2012300	2017040	Sky News is saying that once the payment is accepted, trading standards rules in the UK
2017040	2027920	state that the retailer must comply and deliver the product, however, they have said despite
2027920	2032800	the rules, Tesco site maintains that they do not have to conform to erroneously marked
2032800	2037820	prices unless they fail to notice before shipment.
2037820	2039200	So they may renege all of it.
2039200	2042500	That's gonna cause a stink.
2042500	2047960	But there was apparently some consumers, like one that ordered 39 consoles, although none
2047960	2052000	of them have been delivered yet, so good job.
2052000	2054480	They'd have to do at least a full refund on price.
2054480	2058640	Yeah, especially like, you know, you consider that guy probably thought he was doing a smart
2058640	2059640	thing.
2059640	2062880	Hopefully they won't try to like charge him for all those Xbox 360s or he's not gonna
2062880	2063880	be happy.
2063880	2066400	I don't think they can do that.
2066400	2067400	Probably not.
2067400	2068400	Probably not.
2068400	2072240	I want to point out in response to the last story, because there's a bit of a delay from
2072240	2077880	when we say it to one of the live listeners here, ActDeft says, free is good, except for
2077880	2079880	Yaris.
2079880	2083600	Good point.
2083600	2084600	Also
2084600	2085760	You do pay in time, don't you?
2085760	2091040	I have more rock band stuff, and this is not gonna be free, sadly, but this sounds like
2091040	2092600	really cool.
2092600	2096280	This came from an interview with the official Xbox magazine, and some more details have
2096280	2101480	surfaced from Harmonix about rock band, and apparently, okay, you're gonna be able to
2101480	2104240	take your band and export it to a webpage.
2104240	2110000	And from there, you can take band avatars, pose your band avatars, make album covers
2110000	2113840	with your band logo, make all these different scenes, and then you can turn that into real
2113840	2115560	world stuff.
2115560	2119720	You can make figurines based on these rock band characters, t-shirts that have the fake
2119720	2124720	album art on them, and then tour dates that are just basically the accomplishments from
2124720	2125720	the game.
2125720	2127480	Oh, I want fucking figures.
2127480	2128480	That would be awesome.
2128480	2129480	I think that's awesome.
2129480	2130480	That's a smart idiot.
2130480	2131480	It's like Spore.
2131480	2133880	It's like all that stuff you saw with Spore, like they were gonna let you do the printing
2133880	2134880	or whatever.
2134880	2137600	I think somebody saw that and thought that was a great idea.
2137600	2142320	And you know, I think some of it's probably gonna be kind of junky, like, you know, some
2142320	2145560	of the blogs have been saying, like, oh, this is basically gonna be, like, cafe e-press
2145560	2146560	quality.
2146560	2149200	True, but name me other games that do that.
2149200	2150200	There's not a lot.
2150200	2151200	Well, there is.
2151200	2152200	It's still kind of neat.
2152200	2155720	There is the Madden thing where you can buy a fucking ring for, like, $500.
2155720	2156720	That's true.
2156720	2157720	That's a little crazy.
2157720	2161480	I'm excited to see how this plays out, because obviously it's not up there yet, but it must
2161480	2165640	be coming soon, because the game is out on Tuesday.
2165640	2169160	I will say, though, there are some pretty interesting, there are some of the load screens
2169160	2170160	on there.
2170160	2174800	They will have fake album art and stuff like that, and fake little, like, portraits and
2174800	2179000	stuff with your characters that you design in it, like in different poses, which look
2179000	2180000	kind of neat.
2180000	2181680	I thought the trivia was interesting.
2181680	2185400	We played the Freeze Pop song, and it said something about Freeze Pop once got arrested
2185400	2188320	in Canada and ate lots of poutine.
2188320	2192000	And I was like, that's completely random.
2192000	2194720	I'm like, wow.
2194720	2197360	I'm like, do people outside of Canada even know what poutine is?
2197360	2198360	I don't think so.
2198360	2199360	We'll see.
2199360	2200360	Anyway.
2200360	2201360	I don't know what it is.
2201360	2202360	It's basically french fries and gravy.
2202360	2204680	That sounds really yummy.
2204680	2207840	I have Canadian friends online that, like, blog about it.
2207840	2209360	It's so good, apparently.
2209360	2210360	I don't know.
2210360	2211680	I know we've got Canadian listeners.
2211680	2215600	I kind of do that with my leftover chips from the British food store.
2215600	2216600	Alright.
2216600	2217600	I get it.
2217600	2219480	I put chip shop curry on it.
2219480	2222240	Why is it this show always turns into the food show?
2222240	2223240	Somebody asked me that.
2223240	2224240	Because we're hungry.
2224240	2226040	Did food and gaming go hand in hand like that?
2226040	2227040	Yes.
2227040	2228040	Alright.
2228040	2229040	Anyhow.
2229040	2238160	Well, for other stuff, Rob, for anyone who is familiar with Atlas USA, they are bringing
2238160	2244800	out Spectro Force 3 and Operation Darkness for Xbox 360, which is pretty cool.
2244800	2251440	Atlas gave us Trauma Center on Wii, so we are getting their new localizations.
2251440	2257240	And they made the cute little tactical game with the voice acting on PS2.
2257240	2258240	God damn it.
2258240	2259620	Why can't I think of it?
2259620	2260620	Really popular.
2260620	2261620	Just got a sequel recently.
2261620	2262620	Disgaea.
2262620	2263620	Thank you, Disgaea.
2263620	2264620	Disgaea.
2264620	2265620	Yeah.
2265620	2266620	And Persona.
2266620	2267620	They made that too.
2267620	2268620	They published it.
2268620	2269620	So we're getting more.
2269620	2270620	Oh, true.
2270620	2271620	True.
2271620	2272620	Yes.
2272620	2273620	They're publishing.
2273620	2274620	But yeah, we're getting more fun.
2274620	2275620	The difference.
2275620	2276620	My bad.
2276620	2280320	But I was going to say that Operation Darkness looked like crap, by the way.
2280320	2284040	It's like, I don't know, it looked dumb from what I remember when they were first showing
2284040	2286120	video of that.
2286120	2294080	Anywho, so Lionhead, you may remember them from the Fable series, well, they're looking
2294080	2298120	for some custom insults for Fable 2.
2298120	2304240	So they actually have a whole thing where you can submit your insults to them and apparently
2304240	2307920	if they like it, they will put it in the game.
2307920	2311980	So that's kind of neat.
2311980	2314000	I have one.
2314000	2317240	Your gameplay makes me want to go play a PlayStation 3.
2317240	2318960	Is that good?
2318960	2319960	No.
2319960	2327160	Some of the ones that they were saying, or that were on there already, Groin Crab, Loner
2327160	2335040	McLonelyton, and Big Girls Blouse, which I don't understand that.
2335040	2340720	What do you think would happen if I submitted, so they're names to call people?
2340720	2345880	You know, to be honest, all they need to do is monitor names and little catch phrases
2345880	2348640	that are in Animal Crossing, because I mean that's what people do anyway.
2348640	2349640	Oh, good point.
2349640	2360160	I was going to say like, as a joke, if you're supposed to submit things that are like name
2360160	2365240	calling or whatever, let's all submit Bobby Black Wolf as a name calling thing.
2365240	2367040	Funny.
2367040	2371480	Just kidding, Bobby, if you're listening, all right, moving on.
2371480	2375440	One thing that they don't want you putting your opinions in and don't want you asking
2375440	2379840	about anymore is Bioshock on the PlayStation 3.
2379840	2383360	Damn it, Sony fanboys, 2K Games has given you the smackdown.
2383360	2385440	It is not happening.
2385440	2390800	It's an official response on the 2K forums, and this is what the moderator had to say.
2390800	2394540	Quote, please don't tell me you made an account just for this question.
2394540	2397720	There will be no PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock.
2397720	2401360	It has been explained time and time again.
2401360	2407160	So if you were hoping to save some, what do they call them, little sisters on the PlayStation
2407160	2408480	3 version?
2408480	2409480	Not going to happen.
2409480	2410480	Sorry, kids.
2410480	2411800	Bioshock 2?
2411800	2412800	You never know.
2412800	2414800	I mean, you know there's got to be a Bioshock 2 at some point.
2414800	2420760	This game's getting amazing reviews, but Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3, well, if there's enough
2420760	2424000	PlayStation 3s out there, they'll probably do it.
2424000	2425100	So that's that.
2425100	2427320	No Bioshock for you PlayStation 3 kids.
2427320	2428920	But, but, but we like...
2428920	2429920	No.
2429920	2430920	Okay.
2430920	2436320	Well, they are now putting out something very interesting for PlayStation 3.
2436320	2440480	I think this is very interesting.
2440480	2449160	Trend Micro Incorporated is putting out antivirus software for the PlayStation 3.
2449160	2453620	I don't know if that's sort of interesting, but they're saying that the home systems now
2453620	2458360	are going to be vulnerable to spyware and viruses for being able to go on the internet.
2458360	2460720	Is that so my PlayStation 3 doesn't get herpes?
2460720	2461720	I thought...
2461720	2466680	I don't know if it's antivirus software, but I think Trend Micro is doing the parental
2466680	2471040	controls on the internet browser that they're going to add...
2471040	2476800	I think they've already added them with the last update, but it's basically just parental
2476800	2477800	controls, I think.
2477800	2482880	Yeah, it's to block the sites that are more notorious for providing the...
2482880	2484480	No porno for you, kiddies.
2484480	2489000	Well, they're saying that it's blocking malicious websites and also putting in the parental
2489000	2491520	lock-out.
2491520	2494440	I think that more parents should be locked out from their PlayStation 3.
2494440	2495960	I'm kidding.
2495960	2496960	Totally not serious.
2496960	2504120	Well, I used my PlayStation 3 the other day, unfortunately, to watch License to Wed.
2504120	2505120	What?
2505120	2506120	Sad.
2506120	2509580	Anyways, I got it for free.
2509580	2512480	So yeah, there was actually something pretty cool, and this is a little bit of a positive
2512480	2514040	spin on the PlayStation Eye now.
2514040	2517920	I think the Eye of Judgment is a piece of crap, however, the PlayStation Eye not so
2517920	2519640	bad because it's just a camera.
2519640	2525780	But they had a video that was posted on the official Sony blog that was showing off some
2525780	2528920	of their tech demos that they're making with the PlayStation Eye.
2528920	2530760	Why the fuck they haven't done this stuff yet?
2530760	2532640	Because it's actually pretty cool.
2532640	2539120	A guy made a little Lunar Lander kind of game just by drawing something on a piece of paper,
2539120	2542760	and the PlayStation Eye turned it into a game.
2542760	2548440	They also had another one that looked kind of like combat on the Atari 2600, but it was
2548440	2551800	done by scanning in tanks and stuff that you draw.
2551800	2555880	So I thought all that stuff was pretty cool, and that they should implement that, or at
2555880	2559360	least put it on their PlayStation Network.
2559360	2560520	Something to do with the PlayStation Eye.
2560520	2561800	I think it's good stuff.
2561800	2566160	Hopefully they'll have something later on, like in, say, Little Big Planet, where you
2566160	2568200	can draw things into the environment.
2568200	2571360	That would be pretty awesome.
2571360	2576160	You know, I think this is the problem with all these camera peripherals, peripherals
2576160	2581500	in general, they come out for like one or two games, and then they're not continued
2581500	2584320	to be supported, therefore the peripherals never sell.
2584320	2589400	You have to make a ton of games for the peripherals in order for them to finally sell.
2589400	2596120	Like for example here, the Xbox Vision camera.
2596120	2600760	That is a piece of useless crap, and I'm sad to have made that mistake twice now with both
2600760	2607080	the Eye toy and the vision camera.
2607080	2610720	And that's why I haven't bought a PlayStation Eye yet, because I don't want to buy another
2610720	2612920	useless camera.
2612920	2618700	Exactly, like how many things can you use that stupid vision cam for?
2618700	2622400	One to make your own icon on Xbox Live that only your friends can see.
2622400	2623400	Yay, Totem Ball!
2623400	2624400	That game was awesome!
2624400	2629760	I'm not going to count Totem Ball, because that's something against the Xbox Live camera.
2629760	2633480	And then there's Strip Uno.
2633480	2635120	That's it.
2635120	2636240	That's all the cam is good for.
2636240	2639800	And they also have strip checkers, strip chests.
2639800	2643580	And I guess you also have hardwood hearts or whatever, but who plays those games?
2643580	2644580	Hardwood hearts.
2644580	2650240	But seriously, did you play the Spyglass games or whatever it was called?
2650240	2651240	It was kind of crap.
2651240	2653480	It was kind of sloppy, I don't know.
2653480	2658340	Just because a game supports the fucking camera, which to be honest, I think all of the games
2658340	2661840	should support the damn camera.
2661840	2663800	I don't know.
2663800	2666560	Jason brings up a point, Texas Hold'em supports it now.
2666560	2667560	I forgot about that.
2667560	2668560	Oh, yay.
2668560	2669720	That is true.
2669720	2672600	I haven't played Texas Hold'em in a long time.
2672600	2675640	Which is too bad, because I think we were invited to a tournament, and that reminds
2675640	2680360	me, I need to reply to that email, because we're being stuck up by not replying.
2680360	2681360	My bad.
2681360	2682760	All right.
2682760	2683960	But we really suck at Hold'em.
2683960	2684960	Is anybody good at Hold'em?
2684960	2685960	I was okay.
2685960	2686960	Really?
2686960	2687960	You should play for us then.
2687960	2688960	Not that good.
2688960	2691640	Well, I'm okay at it.
2691640	2692640	We could all play.
2692640	2694960	We could all go to the same place and play together.
2694960	2697240	I have better things to play.
2697240	2702840	I played Hold'em once with Bobby for maybe 20 minutes, and that was it.
2702840	2703840	All right.
2703840	2707520	Anyhow, very cool news for the PlayStation 3.
2707520	2708800	Yes, that's right.
2708800	2710360	Very cool news for the PlayStation 3.
2710360	2711800	I'm completely serious here.
2711800	2712800	What?
2712800	2713800	Yeah, I know.
2713800	2715800	Divx is going to be partnering with Sony.
2715800	2717860	This is based on an announcement from Divx.
2717860	2723640	They're going to be integrating its video playback technology into the PlayStation 3.
2723640	2729440	If you update your development kits to 2.0, you can already utilize the Divx technology
2729440	2735960	for your games, and hopefully, if Divx gets enabled in a future PlayStation 3 firmware
2735960	2740120	upgrade, which at this point, who's to say why wouldn't it, then you can actually watch
2740120	2744120	all the porn that you download over the internet and all the pirated movies.
2744120	2747160	You'll be able to watch that over your local network.
2747160	2751080	That would be totally useful for someone who pirates.
2751080	2753200	Not too bad that I will not be using that.
2753200	2755040	Yes, not that you should be pirating.
2755040	2756040	That's wrong.
2756040	2757040	That's wrong.
2757040	2759840	R. And yeah, you should not be doing that.
2759840	2763280	R. Well, if it's on the internet, it must be okay to download, right?
2763280	2766640	I mean, they wouldn't put something illegal on the internet, would they?
2766640	2768720	No, of course not.
2768720	2771600	That's just completely...
2771600	2777480	Someone from OL Army Ninja in chat says, did OLR really just go two whole stories about
2777480	2780080	Sony and not bad talk them?
2780080	2784720	We said a long time ago, when Sony does something right, we will give them credit for it.
2784720	2785720	Hey, we're...
2785720	2787080	And then we'll make fun of them for everything else.
2787080	2790080	I'm equally offensive against all consoles.
2790080	2797440	For example, this week's live edition, fucking Shrek Enroll and Screwjumper, what the fuck
2797440	2799160	is that shit?
2799160	2805000	Shrek Enroll, first of all, Shrek should never be on the fucking Xbox Live Arcade ever, and
2805000	2806440	obviously this game sucks.
2806440	2808200	You know it was to make it more family friendly.
2808200	2809200	That was the point.
2809200	2814200	Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, was that really your response to that?
2814200	2815200	Yeah.
2815200	2819040	I'll tell you what, THQ needs to make better games then.
2819040	2821000	That's what needs to happen.
2821000	2825320	Stop fucking licensing shit and making crap, because that's what's going to happen when
2825320	2828240	you license shit and get crap.
2828240	2829880	I would also mean it's not crap.
2829880	2831200	How about it?
2831200	2834040	Orange Box, which is not crap.
2834040	2835480	It is not crap.
2835480	2839600	It's going to be on PS3 in December for our European fans.
2839600	2840600	Pretty cool.
2840600	2844040	You will see it on the 14th of December, to be specific.
2844040	2848360	It will not be 2008, like the rumors are said, you are going to see it this year.
2848360	2849360	Great.
2849360	2853760	And I believe it's on the 12th in the US as well.
2853760	2856680	But Portal, Portal...
2856680	2859080	That is no lie, unlike the cake.
2859080	2860080	Portal.
2860080	2862600	Yeah, are you saying just buy this game for Portal and the hell with everything else?
2862600	2864760	Just buy it for Portal, the hell with everything else.
2864760	2869360	Although, I did find a very interesting thing, because I was reading some of the forums about
2869360	2873040	it, because people are trying to piece in where Portal is supposed to fit in the Half-Life
2873040	2878120	story, which I thought was really cool speculation, because I love speculating about storylines
2878120	2879120	and things.
2879120	2880120	Well, hold on.
2880120	2881120	Are you telling me there's Portal fanfic?
2881120	2882120	No.
2882120	2883120	It actually does fanfic.
2883120	2884440	There is.
2884440	2886440	And there's weighted companion cube fan art.
2886440	2887440	Yeah.
2887440	2891080	As long as there's not weighted companion cube slash, then we're okay.
2891080	2892080	No.
2892080	2898520	No, but I was reading just how they were speculating how it fitted in, and someone was saying that
2898520	2905200	there's a way that you can import the Half-Life 2 maps into Portal, and you can use the Portal
2905200	2906440	gun in Half-Life 2.
2906440	2907680	I think it's the other way around.
2907680	2908680	You import...
2908680	2912600	No, it was saying specifically that they moved the maps to the Portal folder.
2912600	2914560	It was using some program or something.
2914560	2920620	I think it's the other way around, they imported the Portal gun into Half-Life 2, but yeah,
2920620	2921620	you can do that.
2921620	2927560	Anyways, I was going to say there is, if you notice in the game, actually there's a few
2927560	2932720	times where you can see through the window, and there's a little slide projector.
2932720	2937960	They're showing Aperture Science versus, I don't remember what the other corporation
2937960	2944040	is in Half-Life 2, so forgive me there, but a whole little thing about that, I guess they're
2944040	2948840	making competing technologies and stuff, and it's even in the song too.
2948840	2952680	They're talking about that whole thing.
2952680	2955360	Why are people in the chat saying Rule 34 and laughing?
2955360	2959840	Is that a Portal joke that I don't get?
2959840	2962480	I don't know.
2962480	2965160	I still haven't played it.
2965160	2966920	Maybe I'll download it on Steam this week.
2966920	2967920	We'll see.
2967920	2969360	I can't tear myself away from the MMOs long enough.
2969360	2972880	Forgive me.
2972880	2974720	This is Creed, it's quite interesting.
2974720	2980720	There's been reports coming out now that the PlayStation 3 version, let's see here, oh
2980720	2985760	I'm sorry that's your story, never mind, PlayStation Store updates, yes.
2985760	2989960	Lots of cool stuff for the PlayStation Store this week, including actually one that I was
2989960	2993880	kind of looking at, although I played something very similar to it, I want to say it was actually
2993880	2999120	on the PlayStation Network, Toy Home, it's a little car racing game, kind of like Micro
2999120	3002040	Machines or something like that, you can play that.
3002040	3005800	High Velocity Bowling, they have a trailer for that.
3005800	3009560	There is a demo now for Uncharted Drake's Fortune, so that's worth checking out, I actually
3009560	3014840	got some good reviews, and then of course trailers for Ratchet and Clank Future, and
3014840	3021500	Time Shift, and Time Crisis 4, oh and Battlefield, Bad Company, and Burnout Paradise.
3021500	3031600	Let's see here, then other than that, there's also a demo for Blazing Angels 2, okay I guess,
3031600	3038960	and then finally, un-game related videos, including The Dark Knight, which is just the
3038960	3047360	teaser trailer, and This Christmas, and Remember That Night.
3047360	3051200	The Dark Knight teaser trailer kind of sucks, I don't know if you've seen it, there's nothing
3051200	3057160	to it, that's the problem, I am so freaking ready for this movie, I can't wait to freaking
3057160	3062080	see it, it looks so awesome, but that trailer sucked, it didn't tell you anything, I had
3062080	3066720	some crappy voiceovers and a spinning card, whoopee doo, oh how would you download that?
3066720	3073640	There's also some Uncharted wallpapers, but no themes yet, so, hooray.
3073640	3079060	Anyhow, you might want to watch out for this though, or maybe you won't get to access that
3079060	3085100	PlayStation store, and that is the brand newly discovered White Screen of Death on the PlayStation
3085100	3093840	3, and the cause, Assassin's Creed, apparently some folks who are using firmware 2.0 are
3093840	3099000	getting the White Screen of Death while playing Assassin's Creed, this is coming up on posts
3099000	3106040	on the Ubisoft forums, and apparently there's a lot of folks that are posting about these
3106040	3114080	freezing issues and bug glitch issues, so there you have it, no real answer as to what
3114080	3118760	exactly causes this, it seems to be somewhat random, but they're saying it also has some
3118760	3124560	frame rate problems, screen tearing, geometry clipping, and lockups.
3124560	3130080	The game actually had a worse frame rate slightly than the Xbox 360 version, and there's also
3130080	3133720	some videos online of some pretty weird glitches in the game, like one where you fall through
3133720	3139960	the earth, there's another one where your character kind of clones himself, and so you're
3139960	3142320	controlling two copies of your character.
3142320	3146600	Now someone on my friends list played both, and actually said the PlayStation 3 is a little
3146600	3155000	better, so maybe if these issues don't come to haunt you, then you're fine, it doesn't
3155000	3156000	matter.
3156000	3161720	I was going to say also that the game ain't that good, that's another thing.
3161720	3162720	You didn't like it really?
3162720	3163720	No.
3163720	3164720	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
3164720	3165720	I've played a little bit of it.
3165720	3168400	I haven't played it yet, but a lot of people are really liking it.
3168400	3170400	What else was I going to say about that?
3170400	3171920	What is it you don't like about it?
3171920	3172920	It's boring.
3172920	3173920	Really?
3173920	3174920	It really is.
3174920	3175920	It's not as...
3175920	3176920	You're going to kill people.
3176920	3178720	Okay, well that's like any game.
3178720	3182660	So I don't know, I just didn't care for it.
3182660	3185360	I didn't see what the fuss was about.
3185360	3186360	Alright.
3186360	3193840	Well, there was a rumor circulating around that Capcom was thinking about putting a Resident
3193840	3201060	Evil 5 demo on the Blu-Ray for Resident Evil Extinction, and also another one saying that
3201060	3205760	Devil May Cry 4 would have a demo on there, but Capcom said, uh-uh, they're just putting
3205760	3207760	trailers up.
3207760	3209040	That would have been so cool, though.
3209040	3210040	I know.
3210040	3212960	I think there's a lot of people very excited about Resident Evil 5.
3212960	3216080	Capcom should do it.
3216080	3217080	The demo is a lie.
3217080	3223520	They should put a really crappy demo for something, just have a stick figure with a head.
3223520	3224680	They should put Doom on there.
3224680	3227120	Yet another bastardization of Mega Man.
3227120	3233960	No, they should do Resident Evil with Doom graphics, with all pixel.
3233960	3234960	I like this.
3234960	3239220	Odd1InChat says, God, I need that Resident Evil 5 demo.
3239220	3244440	Notice how it's not like, I want, I wish they would put it out there, he says, I need it.
3244440	3247080	I need it now.
3247080	3250800	I need Animal Crossing Wii, but I'm just going to have to wait a little longer.
3250800	3251800	Life sucks.
3251800	3252800	Wait.
3252800	3257280	Well, what is it, Dennis Leary says, life sucks, wear a helmet.
3257280	3260280	Life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up.
3260280	3261280	That's all I know.
3261280	3264300	Anyways, well, there's a few games, though, that you're not going to have to wait much
3264300	3267860	longer to play, and that's the stuff coming out this week.
3267860	3272260	So in the US, starting off here- Dear God Friday.
3272260	3275260	I know, oh my God, the release dates for Japan are here.
3275260	3278480	Everybody, give sympathy to our- Everybody, get a book, get a pillow, we're
3278480	3281240	going to have a long segment for release dates.
3281240	3283960	Everybody feel sorry for our retail workers this Friday.
3283960	3287360	No, that's not going to be a long segment, actually, there's not a lot coming out this
3287360	3288360	week.
3288360	3289360	Oh my God.
3289360	3290360	The Japanese ones is huge.
3290360	3293800	Anyways, I was just going to mention, I think this came out last week already, and I have
3293800	3296360	a kind of a last minute story about it later on.
3296360	3301600	Avatar, the Burning Earth, now the new record holder for the fastest way to get achievements
3301600	3302600	on Xbox 360.
3302600	3303600	Hooray.
3303600	3305720	So that's coming out now.
3305720	3309440	Baby Pals on the DS, yes, it's another fucking baby raising sim.
3309440	3312440	Wait, did you say baby raising?
3312440	3313440	Or baby racing?
3313440	3314440	Raising.
3314440	3315440	Dude, they should tell me baby racing.
3315440	3316440	Oh my God, a baby racing game?
3316440	3317440	That would be awesome.
3317440	3321320	A baby racing game would be hardcore, I'd buy that shit.
3321320	3324200	Developers, are you listening?
3324200	3325200	Baby racing.
3325200	3326960	More babies.
3326960	3328440	Babies versus kittens.
3328440	3330680	Who will win?
3330680	3335760	Anyways, Cabela's Monster Bass, it's a bass fishing game on the PlayStation 2.
3335760	3341640	College Hoops 2K8 is coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360 this week.
3341640	3349880	CSI Dark Motives, CSI game on the DS, apparently a venture game, kind of crappy.
3349880	3354440	The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific, another piece of shovelware on PlayStation
3354440	3355680	2, PlayStation 3.
3355680	3357240	Did you call that shovelware?
3357240	3358240	Yeah.
3358240	3359240	What does that mean?
3359240	3360240	It means it's crap.
3360240	3361240	Oh.
3361240	3362240	Anyways.
3362240	3368480	No, actually, it's on PlayStation 2 this week because the other games got delayed.
3368480	3374400	Imagine Fashion Designer on the PC, yes, you too can design crap.
3374400	3378760	Mario Party DS, that's going to be a good game, so pick that one up.
3378760	3383560	Medal of Honor Airborne for the PlayStation 3, I guess better late than never.
3383560	3387040	Monster Jam on the Wii, same there.
3387040	3388040	Let's see.
3388040	3392800	Genesis 4, which is including the GunCon, that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation
3392800	3396360	3, so it might be worth picking up if you like gun games.
3396360	3400540	Unreal Tournament 3, coming out on PC, so that should be pretty awesome.
3400540	3403840	No word on the PlayStation 3 version yet.
3403840	3405760	Let's see.
3405760	3411400	World of Warcraft, March of the Legion, the card game, I don't know if anyone's interested
3411400	3414560	in the World of Warcraft card game.
3414560	3421780	Let's see here, Soldier of Fortune Payback on the PlayStation 3 actually got delayed
3421780	3425320	to this week, which I thought was kind of interesting.
3425320	3430780	AMF Bowling Pin Busters on the Wii, I don't know if this is a good game or not, but it's
3430780	3437220	only 20 bucks, so if you like bowling and you're a little tired of Wii Sports bowling,
3437220	3439320	might want to check that out.
3439320	3445640	And then finally, Final Fantasy Online, they have the Vanadil Collection 2008 on PlayStation
3445640	3450880	2 and Xbox 360, which is going to include, of course, all the previous expansions, the
3450880	3455600	original game, and of course, the other thing that's coming out this week, the Final Fantasy
3455600	3461200	11 Online Wings of the Goddess expansion, which should make some people happy.
3461200	3463200	Yay!
3463200	3464200	Let's see then.
3464200	3467200	Oh, and that's also coming out on PC as well.
3467200	3473800	Then on the DS, John Deere Harvest in the Heartland.
3473800	3477920	It's a farming sim for real.
3477920	3480360	Take that, Harvest Moon.
3480360	3487520	Luxor Pharaoh's Challenge on PlayStation 2, that'll probably suck.
3487520	3490640	Ghost Squad on the Wii, which I highly recommend you pick up.
3490640	3496140	That's only $29.99, so definitely a great gun game for the Wii, and also uses the Wii
3496140	3499080	Zapper, which is also coming out this week.
3499080	3502560	Soul Calibur Legends, which I heard sucked, has come out on the Wii.
3502560	3508600	Rock Band, of course, probably the biggest game this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,
3508600	3511720	both the special edition and the game only.
3511720	3515280	And then Showtime Boxing on the Wii also sucked.
3515280	3520200	Star Trek Conquest on PlayStation 2 also sucked.
3520200	3525880	Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake, probably also sucks.
3525880	3530600	Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, that game's pretty good on the DS.
3530600	3541940	Godzilla Unleashed also sucked, and I believe that is it.
3541940	3545520	And you said there's not a lot coming out this week, come on, that took like five minutes.
3545520	3547560	That's because I'm slow.
3547560	3553480	Coming out over on the Japanese shores, Final Fantasy XI Wings of the Goddess comes out
3553480	3556840	for Xbox 360 this week on November 22nd.
3556840	3559560	I think it has a different name in Japan, though.
3559560	3563960	We're calling it Wings of the Goddess over here, but I want to say it's called Altana's
3563960	3566320	Heroes or something like that over there, I can't remember.
3566320	3570040	Anyhow, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally makes its way to the Xbox
3570040	3572560	360 as well this week in Japan.
3572560	3577840	Also coming out, Medal of Honor Airborne, also for the 360, and another 360 game, and
3577840	3580120	you didn't think there was anything for the 360 in Japan.
3580120	3584340	Winning XI 2008 makes its way to Japan.
3584340	3589160	Coming to the Wii this week in Japan, Dragon Blade comes out.
3589160	3595560	This is from D3, is publishing this, and yep, looks like another role-playing game.
3595560	3599720	It's an action game like God of War, it's a rip-off of God of War, but it's not even
3599720	3601760	close to being as good as God of War.
3601760	3604960	Interesting because from the box art and everything, it looks like your typical RPG, but there
3604960	3605960	you have it.
3605960	3610960	My own Sonic at the Olympics makes its way to Japan, also on the Wii this week, the 22nd.
3610960	3614240	Coming out on PlayStation 3, another version of Harry Potter, because of course those games
3614240	3616040	come out on every console.
3616040	3623760	Also Remi no Oishi Restaurant, which you know better on these shores as Ratatouille, that
3623760	3629160	movie Ratatouille, whatever, how do you say that, I don't even know.
3629160	3634480	PlayStation 2 gets a reduction in price on all of the Fatal Frame games this week, so
3634480	3638440	if you miss the Fatal Frame series, now's your chance.
3638440	3642000	Also coming out, another version of Wings of the Goddess for Final Fantasy XI hits the
3642000	3645920	PlayStation 2 as well, because they say in Japan most players are on the PS2, because
3645920	3649280	that's where the game came out first.
3649280	3656120	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Pre-Saga, Princess Osagasi, that's coming out from Able,
3656120	3662220	and it's an adventure game involving princesses, hooray!
3662220	3668440	Also coming out, Umisho, the limited edition, an adventure game coming out as well, I'm
3668440	3672440	trying to see if we have any, no, but it looks like it's based around the swimming team,
3672440	3676980	is this an anime I don't know about, probably, probably.
3676980	3681800	Also coming out on the DS, Dragon Quest IV, this isn't the new one, but this is a remake
3681800	3686860	of the old school Dragon Quest IV, so check that out on the DS, and yes, it looks like
3686860	3690900	it takes full advantage of the dual screen capabilities, for instance when you're battling
3690900	3694380	your party status shows on the top screen, and the monsters that you're fighting and
3694380	3696680	all the different commands show up on the bottom screen.
3696680	3701740	If you were hoping to import that one, I hope you read Japanese fluently, because there's
3701740	3704120	no Engrish in it.
3704120	3712340	Also coming out on the DS, Uno Ikusi, IQ Breeder is coming out, and it looks like something
3712340	3718440	between a dog sim and a brain training game, so that's great, take your two biggest DS
3718440	3724200	games, cram them together, and you have this game, lovely, maybe it's where you beat the
3724200	3731660	dog until it's smart, I somehow doubt that, aww, alright, there it is, your Japanese releases.
3731660	3737940	Puppies, okay, well there's a crap load of stuff coming out in the UK, on the 22nd we
3737940	3747140	have Final Fantasy XI, Wings of the Goddess, yay, Smarty Pants on Wii, 23rd Ace Combat
3747140	3750740	6, Fires of Liberation, which actually is not all that great, I will just tell you that
3750740	3759020	from experience, Beowulf, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II, Code Lyoko,
3759020	3765580	I guess, CSI Crime Scene Investigation, Hard Evidence, Dewey's Adventure, Ferrari Challenge
3765580	3771060	on Wii and DS, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock on a bunch of stuff, Jackass the Game, Juice
3771060	3777540	2, Hot Import Nights, Kane and Lynch, Deadman, Lair, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games,
3777540	3783660	Mass Effect, Medal of Honor, Heroes 2, My Horse and Me, I just think that's a funny
3783660	3795860	name, oh, how can I forget Mass Effect, Boo Loki, Boo You, whatever, NBA 2K8, Need for
3795860	3803740	Speed Pro Street, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance, Siphon Filter,
3803740	3810820	Logan's Shadow, Time Crisis 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Warhammer 40K, Squad Command, I hate Warhammer.
3810820	3814540	Oh, we got some stories in there you'll like later.
3814540	3815540	Is that it?
3815540	3816540	Yeah.
3816540	3817540	Wow.
3817540	3820620	You just threw that mic down at the mere mention of Warhammer.
3820620	3822140	The fuck is Warhammer shit?
3822140	3824140	Okay, it's the case it goes.
3824140	3827460	Bad memories of Warhammer.
3827460	3828460	Do share.
3828460	3832940	I dated a guy who was a Warhammer player and all he did was play Warhammer.
3832940	3838220	Replace Warhammer with World of Warcraft and you have a lot of relationships in this day
3838220	3839220	and age.
3839220	3842900	He would spend hours painting his stupid little models and where the stupid little models
3842900	3846820	were kind of cool, I was like, dude, you are too obsessed with this shit.
3846820	3852820	I got too bored with painting the models so I just, you know.
3852820	3857380	The models suck, they're like a few millimeters tall, I was like, fuck, I can't paint this
3857380	3858380	shit.
3858380	3865700	My dog ended up eating a lot of them anyways, so, wow, but they were cool, yeah, for a while.
3865700	3870780	Anyways, one thing that's also cool, although it's a little late for it about now, is a
3870780	3872020	new Terminator game.
3872020	3877140	Yeah, Halcon is adapting Terminator for a brand new game, hopefully it's not based off
3877140	3881980	the new Terminator series, which I'm sure is going to blow, but I'm sure tons, I was
3881980	3886620	just going to say this Terminator thing comes just in time for the Sarah Connor Chronicles,
3886620	3890420	which I'm sure tons of people will be watching this winter on FOX during the writer's strike.
3890420	3896140	Yes, Sarah Connor Chronicles, it's like, yeah, it's going to be a Terminator movie without
3896140	3897140	the Terminator.
3897140	3902140	Oh, but there's a chick who's a Terminator also, and she's, it's like, seriously.
3902140	3906600	But the chick Terminator was in Firefly and therefore it does have a couple points of
3906600	3908060	win attached.
3908060	3914500	It's fucking emo shit, just like goddamn, was it Smallville or something like that,
3914500	3919260	where they just, oh, there's Terminators coming after me, it's like, seriously, they're just
3919260	3922580	going to keep coming after you until you die, so get used to it.
3922580	3928060	It also has the, you better not make my character gay kid from Heroes in it, who was then written
3928060	3929060	out of the show.
3929060	3930060	Remember that?
3930060	3933980	The management was like, found the scripts where he was supposed to be gay and then like,
3933980	3936660	no, you need to write that he's in love with the cheerleader, and then he was in the show.
3936660	3940540	Why don't the Terminators go back in time, like way back in time, to like the Civil War
3940540	3945240	era and kill like their great, great, great, great grandparents or something like that,
3945240	3946240	you know?
3946240	3949940	Pick a fight with something, fuck, they can't even kill someone back in like the 80s and
3949940	3952860	shit with their superior technology.
3952860	3953860	Lame.
3953860	3959860	Anyways, so yeah, they're developing a game, it's going to be a Terminator game, and no
3959860	3964860	word on what the hell it is, but it's not going to come out until mid-2009, it's also
3964860	3971840	I guess based on their upcoming film, Terminator Salvation, the future begins, lame!
3971840	3973220	But that's going to be coming out later.
3973220	3977780	I love this comment from Odd1 in our chat room, who's making a lot of win comments tonight,
3977780	3978780	good job.
3978780	3982340	Odd1 says, Terminator without the Terminator, great.
3982340	3989980	Next up, Star Wars without lightsabers, and Doctor Who based in South Central LA.
3989980	3996700	There you have it, Doctor Who-ed, Doctor Who-ed.
3996700	3997700	That's not funny.
3997700	3999720	Yes it is, you're smiling.
3999720	4003180	By the way, did you know I have to play Doctor Who this weekend at the show?
4003180	4006020	I need to go out and buy some Converse this weekend.
4006020	4009020	It kept going back and forth, I was going to be Professor X, not Doctor Who.
4009020	4012700	Go to Payless and get air walks, they're more comfortable.
4012700	4013700	We'll see.
4013700	4022380	Anyhow, I just think the Terminator comment's great.
4022380	4026220	I know why they announced that they're making a new Terminator game to build off the hype
4026220	4031260	of other announcements out there, but I mean, how can you get excited about a game that's
4031260	4035740	going to come out for two years about the Terminator, unless fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger
4035740	4038900	is going to be back into it, which he's not because he's in the fucking political game
4038900	4039900	now.
4039900	4041780	I don't know.
4041780	4042780	I just can't get all excited.
4042780	4047820	I mean, seriously, what good Terminator games have there been out there, excluding the Terminator
4047820	4053180	the Arcade game, which was Terminator 2 the Arcade game, which was okay as a gun game,
4053180	4055900	but really it wasn't that great.
4055900	4061140	Alright, well maybe the Terminator 4 game will make its way to GameTap in the near future,
4061140	4063980	because that's probably the only way I'll actually pay to play it.
4063980	4069060	GameTap, by the way, passed a huge milestone this week, one thousand games now available
4069060	4070260	on the service.
4070260	4072320	What was the one thousandth game?
4072320	4074900	A big one, one that I need to go play right now.
4074900	4077960	I need to stop the show right now and go play this game.
4077960	4081980	Civilization 4 was the one thousandth game, which is, you know, if you've listened to
4081980	4085540	this game for any length of time, you know I have a lot of love for the very first Civilization
4085540	4089540	game, and the others that have come out since then have kind of turned me off, and for that
4089540	4093500	I never touched Civ 4, but I need to go give it a try now, because I have been playing
4093500	4094500	GameTap.
4094500	4096580	I definitely want to go check that out.
4096580	4097820	The other ones are just too complicated.
4097820	4100660	I liked my Civ Simple, which Civ 1 was.
4100660	4105020	So anyhow, for the record, when the service started, there were only 300 games available
4105020	4106020	on it.
4106020	4107840	Now there are a thousand.
4107840	4111980	So on GameTap.com is the information on all the games that are on the service, plus this
4111980	4116620	interesting little, you know, picture.
4116620	4119920	You know those big pictures that are made up of little pictures?
4119920	4120920	They have one of those.
4120920	4121920	A mosaic?
4121920	4122920	Thank you, a mosaic.
4122920	4124720	The word escaped me.
4124720	4129220	They have that, but you can do a mouseover on all the little box arts and see what games
4129220	4130220	they are.
4130220	4133940	Yay, box art!
4133940	4137420	That's exactly what I said, yay box art.
4137420	4142220	All right, anyhow, we are winding down part A of our show tonight, but we can't finish
4142220	4146100	up until we have Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
4146100	4150420	Yes, it's a way to pay homage to our elders, and from what I understand, because Dark Sakura
4150420	4154900	is leaving us for a couple weeks, she had to really pick a doozy to leave us with.
4154900	4161740	So here it is, Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
4161740	4167580	For the Classic Game of the Week, I have picked my favorite ever game, which everybody knows
4167580	4171420	me knows what my favorite game is, I picked The Guardian Legend.
4171420	4172900	When?
4172900	4173900	The Guardian Legend.
4173900	4177480	I'll bring up some gameplay clips right now.
4177480	4185940	So The Guardian Legend is basically a game where you fly into, you know, the planet's
4185940	4192780	name is Naju, N-A-J-U, and it starts off as a shooter, and then it's like an adventure
4192780	4194580	RPG sort of thing.
4194580	4201160	And you talk to these little guys called Blue Landers, who look a lot like Lolo, and it's
4201160	4205380	basically as you're going through it, you know, you have to pick up your power-ups,
4205380	4211740	you actually, as your score goes up, you earn, you know, different other power-ups and more
4211740	4217900	chips, is how your life is, is how your power-ups are stored, and then you earn more life too
4217900	4221340	as you go through the game until you're like the super-powered badass.
4221340	4228020	And there were a couple of neat glitches in the game, one of them where if you had a barrier
4228020	4232620	up the middle, if you held diagonally, you could actually sort of walk through the barrier,
4232620	4235380	which was my favorite trick to use also.
4235380	4240100	You also had, well this is in the glitch, but you had TGL mode, where it had this insane
4240100	4243380	password system, it was just crazy.
4243380	4247620	And although one time I actually put in one randomly and it took me to the end of the
4247620	4255580	game, so that was kind of cool, but you put in TGL, all in caps, and you play through
4255580	4259640	the entire game as a shooter, it gives you your power-ups in between, but it's very challenging
4259640	4260640	to do that.
4260640	4262900	It's really a challenge.
4262900	4265940	And I'm glad you didn't use this one video file that I linked you to, because that person
4265940	4268140	could not play the first level for shit.
4268140	4269140	No.
4269140	4273660	I did my own searching around YouTube to find this clip, it's a little better.
4273660	4276340	So here's some overworld music, and then I'm going to switch to Jamie's favorite song in
4276340	4277340	the game.
4277340	4278340	Yeah.
4278340	4282340	I'll tell you a little bit of it.
4282340	4286140	The one cool thing about this is, for anyone who doesn't know too much about it, the original
4286140	4292740	game was actually on the MSX called Gardick, and this is actually the sequel to that Gardick
4292740	4298500	Gaiden, which was what it was called in Japan.
4298500	4304740	It's also put out by Compile that gave us a bunch of really, really cool games.
4304740	4309860	Actually another one of my favorite shooters was Robo-Eleste, which is, you know, they
4309860	4314300	just did a whole crap ton of shooters.
4314300	4317460	This is somebody shooting the gun repeatedly to open the corridor, because every corridor
4317460	4320540	had its own little trick to open it.
4320540	4323680	Let me actually switch, I'm going to switch to the music that Jamie says is her favorite
4323680	4326180	in the game, which is the music to Corridor Number 6.
4326180	4328180	Here's the overworld music after that.
4328180	4330180	Oh, it's the overworld music after this.
4330180	4332180	The overworld music, yeah.
4332180	4333980	Oh, this music's good, too.
4333980	4336100	I like this one, too, but the overworld music was my favorite.
4336100	4338920	Let me go ahead, I'll skip ahead a little bit in the video.
4338920	4339920	Not that one.
4339920	4340920	Oh, damn it.
4340920	4341920	It was right before that.
4341920	4342920	It was right before this?
4342920	4348900	I think it's right after here.
4348900	4351140	That's the destruction of Corridor 15.
4351140	4354940	Sadly, this game is not on a virtual console, I'm sad to say.
4354940	4356140	It needs to be.
4356140	4358100	This game is freaking great.
4358100	4359380	I love this game.
4359380	4360380	I mean, there's no...
4360380	4362380	This is the music I like.
4362380	4373140	Oh, I remember this one.
4373140	4374660	You know, I love this game.
4374660	4375660	There's no easy way to say it.
4375660	4377060	I don't know what it is about this game.
4377060	4381300	I think it's the fact that it's a little bit of everything, which for the ADD gamer like
4381300	4388500	me is wonderful, and I don't know what we have to do to get a sequel to this game that
4388500	4389500	doesn't suck.
4389500	4394220	I realize there might be licensing issues and who owns the works and such and such,
4394220	4397980	but my God, I beg you, if you're out there and you have the power to make a sequel to
4397980	4400180	this game happen, that doesn't suck.
4400180	4402900	It would technically be the third trilogy, then.
4402900	4407100	I guess that's true, because you do count Gartic, but Gartic, it's not nearly as memorable
4407100	4408100	as this game.
4408100	4410780	If you've seen Gartic, it's not that exciting.
4410780	4413300	This really took it to a whole new level.
4413300	4417500	Well, there is actually another glitch in the game, and I had actually remembered this
4417500	4420860	because I had a glitched copy, my very first one was.
4420860	4426100	If you got your score to 10 million points, the game would crash and you couldn't play
4426100	4427100	any more.
4427100	4428100	Oh.
4428100	4433740	So the later releases would only let you go up to a maximum score of 9,999,990, because
4433740	4437320	the points were all multiples of 10.
4437320	4441380	And for anyone who's a big fan of the compiled games, the Blue Landers, actually one of their
4441380	4445100	mascots, was also in the Sega Master System game called Glovellius.
4445100	4446100	Nice.
4446100	4448060	So there you go.
4448060	4453420	Yes, it was not made by Square, Chatroom, this is compiled, published by Broderbund
4453420	4454420	here in the US.
4454420	4455420	Yep.
4455420	4456420	So there you have it.
4456420	4460180	And because none of those companies exist anymore, that's why it's sadly unlikely we're
4460180	4464540	going to see this, but possibly this game could make its way to Virtual Console, only
4464540	4468860	based on the fact that Lode Runner was also a Broderbund game, and that did come out on
4468860	4471580	Virtual Console for TurboGrafx.
4471580	4474860	So you never know, nothing is impossible, I suppose.
4474860	4479500	But this is one of my, not only does Jamie love this game, I do too, I don't know how
4479500	4482860	Loki feels about it, but he better like it, or he's fired.
4482860	4485660	So there you go.
4485660	4488460	Classic game of the week, Guardian Legend.
4488460	4489460	Well done.
4489460	4494220	Alright, well with that, we are going to wrap up Part A of tonight's show, and we'll be
