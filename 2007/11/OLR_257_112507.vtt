00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Tonight, November 25th, 2007, Guitar Hero gets sued for sounding too good, Super Mario Galaxy

00:21.000 --> 00:31.880
has super sales, and Captain Kirk officially endorses World of Warcraft.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.800
Hello everybody out there on the internet, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.800 --> 00:40.080
We are that video game program dedicated of course to video games, video gaming, gaming

00:40.080 --> 00:41.520
culture and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.880
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me not tonight is Dark Sakura, she has the night off, she's

00:46.880 --> 00:49.320
off for the holidays in Alabama.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.760
We might hear from her a little bit later though, we'll see.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.320
But joining us in studio, say hello to the one and only Loki.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.320
Hello.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.680
How you doing, Loki?

00:56.680 --> 00:57.680
I'm doing fine.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.440
Alright, and since we had an extra seat tonight, we thought we'd bring back a familiar guest.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.320
For those that have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for some time, say hello to intern

01:05.320 --> 01:06.720
Drew is here tonight.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.720
What's up guys?

01:07.720 --> 01:08.720
How you doing?

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
Ah, fair.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
Good.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.760
So Drew, since Dark Sakura's not here tonight, we are going to be relying on you to present

01:13.760 --> 01:15.700
the female perspective of gaming.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.400
Wouldn't that be your job, Rob?

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
No.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.400
What are you trying to imply?

01:19.400 --> 01:20.400
Trying to say something?

01:20.400 --> 01:21.400
Oh, nothing.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
Nothing at all.

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
That's what I thought.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
Alright.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.400
Let's get it started tonight.

01:25.400 --> 01:29.600
We're going to talk about how is your gaming week, and since Jamie's not here, we'll start

01:29.600 --> 01:31.160
with Loki.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.160
Well, let's see.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.520
My gaming week was not filled with Rock Band.

01:36.520 --> 01:42.080
You'd be surprised I didn't really play Rock Band this week, and instead, like Guitar Hero

01:42.080 --> 01:47.420
and all the other music games before them, they are sitting in a nice bundle in a box

01:47.420 --> 01:52.480
or whatever in the corner of the room while I play other things.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.800
We played actually some Project Gotham Racing 3 this week, and we did a little multiplayer

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
on that.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
Wait.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
Project Gotham Racing 3?

01:58.800 --> 01:59.800
3.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.800
Old school.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.400
Well, it's the reason why we played that one instead of 4 is because I have five copies

02:04.400 --> 02:08.240
of Project Gotham Racing 3 and not five copies of Project Gotham Racing 4.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.280
It makes it a little difficult to play that game multiplayer otherwise.

02:12.280 --> 02:19.760
Anyways, so we did that, and then scenes were, of course, as usual, and a little bit of Call

02:19.760 --> 02:25.960
of Duty 4 multiplayer, which is fun, a little bit of Catan, because that's also fun, and

02:25.960 --> 02:31.960
then the game I've been mainly playing the last few days is Zelda Phantom Hourglass,

02:31.960 --> 02:40.880
because originally I had DS, and then it was a nice silver fat one that came out at launch,

02:40.880 --> 02:43.840
and then the music came on and everything went to hell.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.680
I sort of got everything's broken tonight.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.920
Those who were listening live tonight, we had to do three retakes to start the show

02:48.920 --> 02:49.920
tonight.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.920
It's like Jamie's not here.

02:50.920 --> 02:51.920
It all falls apart.

02:51.920 --> 02:52.920
I don't know what the hell's going on.

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
Sorry.

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
Here we go again.

02:54.920 --> 03:03.100
Anyways, so then, let's see, so yeah, basically I ended up trading my silver DS fat for a

03:03.100 --> 03:12.160
pink DS Lite for my wife, and then I bought a non-pink DS Lite for myself, a black one,

03:12.160 --> 03:16.160
so now I have my true official game for myself, because my wife has claimed all the other

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
ones.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.040
What else did I play this week?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.200
I think that's about it, really.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.960
I haven't been playing too much stuff.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.320
I imagine because of the holidays and all, everybody's gaming weeks was a little bit

03:27.320 --> 03:28.320
abbreviated.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.320
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.440
Did you have a good turkey day?

03:31.440 --> 03:33.240
Yeah, we had two turkeys.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.240
A pig?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.240
No, no, no.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.240
Show off.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.120
We did not eat two turkeys.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.440
We had two turkeys.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
I see.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.440
One of them was at the table.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.920
No, we had, because it's an interesting story.

03:46.920 --> 03:52.640
We had things given over at Nellie's parents' house, and they had bought a turkey, and then

03:52.640 --> 03:54.720
Nellie's dad won a turkey at work.

03:54.720 --> 04:00.960
The ironic thing is he doesn't like turkey, but he won one anyways, so they had two turkeys

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
there.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.760
You know, that's funny, because I don't like turkey either, so they always have to make

04:04.760 --> 04:05.760
ham.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.600
You know, turkey's not bad, it's just like, I don't want to, you know, they were trying

04:09.600 --> 04:14.120
to feed me tons of that turkey, and I'm like, fuck this, I'm not eating all that.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.680
Oh, then they wanted me to carve the turkey, and I'm like, I don't know how to fucking

04:16.680 --> 04:17.680
carve a turkey.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.120
I'll give them my best try, but shit.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.520
So yeah, that was my gaming week.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.520
Nice.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.520
Drew, Intern Drew, you want to go next?

04:26.520 --> 04:27.520
Sure.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.360
Well, I haven't been playing much World of Warcraft since my subscription expired, cry,

04:32.360 --> 04:36.560
but surprisingly I've been involved in FPS.

04:36.560 --> 04:42.080
I've been playing Battlefield 2 and getting my ranking up all the way to Sergeant so far,

04:42.080 --> 04:45.840
which is kind of cool, I like playing a medic.

04:45.840 --> 04:52.900
Other than that, second playthrough of Tales of Symphonia, catching in some Twilight Princess

04:52.900 --> 04:58.880
and a little Wild Arms 4, not much spectacular, but it's fun stuff.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.680
Alrighty.

05:00.680 --> 05:05.280
My gaming week, let's see, I've been playing the brand new Final Fantasy XI expansion,

05:05.280 --> 05:11.840
Wings of the Goddess, which, dear Square Enix, I mean, you really blew it with this, I mean,

05:11.840 --> 05:15.280
I don't know what to say, now the game itself is cool, let me get to that in a minute, I'm

05:15.280 --> 05:19.040
talking about the launch, okay, when you have an MMO, and you're going to launch an expansion,

05:19.040 --> 05:23.220
you can expect that all your freaking players who are addicted to this game, especially

05:23.220 --> 05:27.960
Final Fantasy XI people who are pretty rabid about Final Fantasy XI are going to be in

05:27.960 --> 05:31.720
on this game trying to register the game, you can expect they're going to all be on

05:31.720 --> 05:33.320
it once, and so what happens?

05:33.320 --> 05:40.240
Their registration servers go down when it's time to get people on this game, is that literally

05:40.240 --> 05:44.420
I'm sitting there having to click retry over and over and over again for like a half hour

05:44.420 --> 05:47.680
and nothing happens, and that's the point where I'm like, Rob, this is really sad, you're

05:47.680 --> 05:51.840
sitting here clicking your retry button over and over, and can't register the game, what?

05:51.840 --> 05:53.520
Stuck at authenticating.

05:53.520 --> 05:59.320
Well, basically, it was just, lots of people were hammering the servers and it was basically

05:59.320 --> 06:00.760
breaking it, but I mean, you could do it.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.480
Or they just thought that your copy was not authentic enough.

06:03.480 --> 06:07.600
No, well, I'm looking right at it, does this not look like the real deal, hello?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.360
That looks like the real deal forgery to me.

06:10.360 --> 06:15.680
Here's the other thing, is that the PC version of the game was delayed, the game was supposed

06:15.680 --> 06:20.000
to hit shelves on Tuesday, no, shipped Tuesday to shelf Wednesday, right?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.920
And then what happens, the PC version gets delayed by a day, which means that in reality

06:23.920 --> 06:28.640
it didn't come out on Thanksgiving, obviously, it came out on Black Friday, Rob, what?

06:28.640 --> 06:32.160
What Final Fantasy game would it be if it weren't delayed a little bit?

06:32.160 --> 06:36.720
But the fun thing is, it was only the PC version in the US that got delayed, so everybody's

06:36.720 --> 06:41.040
playing Dancer and Scholar, all the people in Japan and Europe playing the new classes,

06:41.040 --> 06:44.400
and all the PC players are just, hmm, tear.

06:44.400 --> 06:48.480
But I mean, this is how rabid people are, okay, you look at the Final Fantasy XI forums,

06:48.480 --> 06:50.960
and people are like, okay, here's what you can do.

06:50.960 --> 06:56.080
You can go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game, this is a real threat I saw on

06:56.080 --> 07:01.640
Wednesday, the workaround, go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game, use the key

07:01.640 --> 07:07.120
to register, if you can get through the registration server, download a torrent of the European

07:07.120 --> 07:12.320
PC version, and then hack the initialization file to make the European game think it's

07:12.320 --> 07:13.320
the US.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.320
That's the workaround.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.320
That's what people were doing.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
That's the workaround.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.320
That's a workaround.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.320
That is a hell of a workaround.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.320
Or you just fucking wait.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.640
I swear to God, you just wait.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.640
Fucking addicts.

07:22.640 --> 07:23.640
Just wait your turn.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.920
We have to wait for our loud extension.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.680
This is what I finally decided to do, was wait, but I guess people are still having

07:28.680 --> 07:29.680
problems getting on there.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.160
I did finally get my copy registered yesterday, I guess they fixed some servers, but they

07:33.160 --> 07:34.720
kind of botched the launch.

07:34.720 --> 07:41.240
As for the game itself, I was kind of hoping for a little bit more for the users that are

07:41.240 --> 07:44.920
not at the end game level yet, like me, because I've been playing this game for how many

07:44.920 --> 07:49.680
years yet, I can never seem to level a job past like 55 because I have extreme ADD.

07:49.680 --> 07:54.660
Well, that and all the fucking level cap quests suck.

07:54.660 --> 07:57.600
But I've got to say, with all the changes they've made to Final Fantasy XI, they've

07:57.600 --> 07:59.320
made a lot of changes for the better.

07:59.320 --> 08:04.100
They've made items not so impossible to get in many ways.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.200
The economy's eh, but I don't know.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.720
I think the game's made a lot of improvements, like classes have gotten changes that needed

08:10.720 --> 08:11.720
it.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.320
And the new classes are pretty cool, Dancer's pretty awesome and helps with small parties

08:15.320 --> 08:16.320
and Scholar's kind of cool too.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.640
You mean I don't have to compete with bots to get a freaking pair of lizard boots anymore?

08:19.640 --> 08:23.920
Well, they're Rari X now, so it does them no good to camp Lizzie, because the boots

08:23.920 --> 08:26.560
are Rari X, so if they get it, they can't sell it.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.120
I would camp it and drop the boots just to piss people off.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.760
That'd be awesome.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.400
That's a lot of time though, you call me sad for clicking retry over and over.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.560
You should play well, they'd welcome people like you.

08:37.560 --> 08:42.600
I don't have time to do that stuff, I mean come on, look at my gaming week.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.960
Let us go to the chat room for some comments, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.320
Rama says the World of Warcraft fans are probably just as bad, Rob.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.440
I bet to some extent yes, but at least I don't remember Blizzard like buckling under pressure

08:54.440 --> 08:56.100
when Burning Crusade launched.

08:56.100 --> 09:01.080
They knew, okay, six million people are going to be registering the game today.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.540
And I think they did alright.

09:02.540 --> 09:07.600
I seem to remember when WoW first launched, they kind of had some bumps, but I guess they

09:07.600 --> 09:10.040
didn't realize how big the game was going to be.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.040
Huge.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.040
Yeah.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.520
Anyhow, the game itself, I need a little more time to explore the new areas, but I like

09:16.520 --> 09:18.520
some of the new music and some of the old areas I went into.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.520
Did they add any new areas?

09:20.520 --> 09:25.960
Well, they're the old areas 20 years ago, so there's different mobs, and it's not the

09:25.960 --> 09:27.800
exact same thing with different colors.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.680
For instance, one of the areas I traveled to in the past, Roland Barry Fields, you go

09:31.680 --> 09:35.440
to it in the past and you see like destruction, because it's supposed to be like 20 years

09:35.440 --> 09:38.020
ago when the war was going on, the Crystal War was going on.

09:38.020 --> 09:40.960
You see destruction, like there'll be holes in the path where it looks like cannonballs

09:40.960 --> 09:44.100
have struck the path, and things like that, so it's not like the exact same thing with

09:44.100 --> 09:45.100
different colors.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.240
Can you go to the towns and stuff on there like that, too?

09:46.240 --> 09:51.280
You can't go to Juno, but apparently you can go to the other big three, Sandoria and Winderset

09:51.280 --> 09:52.280
and all that.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.280
Yay, caverns of time.

09:53.280 --> 09:57.920
Yes, but the Crystal War thing was written in the 11 story long before WoW was out, so

09:57.920 --> 09:59.920
you can't say they did off WoW.

09:59.920 --> 10:04.040
Yes, watch the intro movie sometime.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.080
I know, but they've had that in since Warcraft II.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
Can't we have both?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.080
Isn't there room for both?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.120
Why's it always got to be WoW versus whatever?

10:11.120 --> 10:12.120
There's room for both.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.720
I'm playing both right now, and not much else because of it.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.080
That's because you're a double addict.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.080
But I did play Rock Band, and I bought Rock Band.

10:19.080 --> 10:24.960
I did not spend $170 on the Deluxe Bundle, because I just knew, like after our preview

10:24.960 --> 10:29.280
last week, I was like, you know, I just don't think I'm going to want to go through the

10:29.280 --> 10:32.080
setup of setting up the drums and everything this much.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.080
As much as I love that guitar, I thought the guitar was a great controller, I'm kind of

10:36.080 --> 10:39.320
pissed off that the companies can't play together.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.480
Like, you know how that guitar won't work with Guitar Hero?

10:42.480 --> 10:43.480
It will.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.800
I heard there was some compatibility chart I saw.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.800
Only on Playstation 3.

10:45.800 --> 10:46.800
Only on PS3.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.800
Well, that's actually a fuck of a lot of good.

10:48.800 --> 10:55.160
Actually, if I remember correctly, I think it was, I want to say the Rock Band ones weren't

10:55.160 --> 10:58.520
working on Guitar Hero 3 or something like that.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.080
All I know is that the Guitar Hero 2 controller works with both, so I'm like, you know what,

11:02.080 --> 11:03.520
I'll just continue to use that.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.880
Even though my yellow button is starting to stick a little bit, I'll just use that.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.400
Because the Rock Band songs aren't particularly hard.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.040
Like I notice I'm doing way better on hard level on Rock Band than I do in Guitar Hero.

11:14.040 --> 11:19.280
But I think that's just because I think it's a little bit better of a learning curve than

11:19.280 --> 11:23.600
Guitar Hero, because like, in the hard difficulty on Rock Band, I notice they add the fifth

11:23.600 --> 11:27.880
button, but they don't use it a lot, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.520
So you get some time to adjust to that.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.520
I don't know.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.840
Because your pinkies are weak.

11:32.840 --> 11:36.500
Yeah, I haven't had as much problems adjusting to Rock Band at all.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.320
But to be honest, I've only explored single player mode.

11:39.320 --> 11:43.500
I have yet to make a band, so I have yet to explore that mode.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.680
So I can't really give a full review on the game, other than I've enjoyed what I've seen

11:46.680 --> 11:47.680
so far.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.280
That's because you don't have any friends, because of how unlikable you are.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.200
I want to be able to make a band for single player.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.640
Like I want to be able to make my bandmates, you know?

11:56.640 --> 12:00.080
That's what I was under the impression that's what you were going to be able to do, was

12:00.080 --> 12:05.360
to make your own bands, and make your characters, and you can play each one individually, and

12:05.360 --> 12:09.440
then have them all come together, but I guess not.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.360
Because there would be no bass man.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.360
Yeah, because there's no bass single player mode, which I was surprised to find out too.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.740
So I guess there's little places they can improve.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.480
But I love the presentation of Rock Band.

12:20.480 --> 12:25.080
I love the way it looks, and how your characters get integrated into the loading screens.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.480
I think that's hilarious, so very cool.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.360
Other than that, not a whole lot else I've been playing because of Thanksgiving and all,

12:32.360 --> 12:33.360
and mine was great.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.360
Thanks for asking.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
Very small.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.200
We did not have two turkeys like at Loki's house did.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.200
All right.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.840
Well, that being said, let's go to some housekeeping for tonight before we get into the gaming

12:42.840 --> 12:43.840
news tonight.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.720
First thing we should say is that we're only going to be one part tonight.

12:46.720 --> 12:52.160
There's not going to be a part B this week, reason being that because of the holidays,

12:52.160 --> 12:55.960
because of Jamie's absence, and there just really wasn't a lot of gaming news this week,

12:55.960 --> 12:58.960
so we decided we'd just make it a short show.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.680
Apparently a lot of folks didn't think we were going to be on at all, and maybe that's

13:01.680 --> 13:04.360
because I thought I said at the end of last week's show we were going to be here after

13:04.360 --> 13:05.360
all, but maybe not.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.360
I don't know.

13:06.360 --> 13:10.120
So I know we were kind of going back and forth, so we are here this week, but only for one

13:10.120 --> 13:11.120
part.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.480
There will not be two parts to this week's show.

13:12.480 --> 13:18.440
However, I do believe in lieu of a part B, I believe the Wee Zapper Challenge is happening

13:18.440 --> 13:19.440
tonight.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.440
Yes.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.440
Yes.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.680
So after the show, and of course this will be archived, we will be doing the Wee Zapper

13:24.680 --> 13:30.080
Challenge where Loki has said that he does not need the Wee Zapper to do good in a game,

13:30.080 --> 13:31.800
so he's going to play with just the normal emote.

13:31.800 --> 13:36.160
I will be using the Wee Zapper, and whoever gets the higher score or what have you.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.480
I don't know.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.360
If I win, you have to take me out.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.240
If you win, I have to take Nellie out, but what if she won't go out with me?

13:43.240 --> 13:44.240
I don't know.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.240
All right.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.240
Then I'll buy you guys dinner or something.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.240
We'll just think of something.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.240
How about this?

13:48.240 --> 13:49.240
We'll make it a lot easier.

13:49.240 --> 13:55.280
If I win, you get me a $20 gift card to some place, restaurant or something, and if you

13:55.280 --> 13:57.920
win, I'll give you a $20 gift card to some place or something.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
All right.

13:58.920 --> 13:59.920
That makes it easy.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.920
Loser wears the tingle outfit.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.520
No, I don't think so.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.120
Well, there would have to be a tingle outfit first off.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.120
No.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.120
We will make one.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.120
No.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.120
I will get Ken to make one.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.120
You kids know better.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.280
You know the tingle outfit is reserved for one million copies of Eye of Judgment sold.

14:13.280 --> 14:14.280
Ready?

14:14.280 --> 14:15.280
Go.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.280
Still waiting.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.280
Still waiting.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.280
I still haven't seen the MPD.

14:18.280 --> 14:22.640
I actually have seen the MPD numbers come over for October, but I believe the Eye of

14:22.640 --> 14:25.280
Judgment was just within that.

14:25.280 --> 14:31.240
Although, in a few more weeks, we'll have the MPD numbers for November, and I'll let

14:31.240 --> 14:35.040
you guys know where Eye of Judgment is standing as far as sales go.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.640
On its way to a million in six months.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.640
Yeah, right.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.640
Sounds good.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.640
All right.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.000
Chat, who said you guys could come up with what the terms of the bet are?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.680
Now, the chat is expressing some disappointment because they were looking forward to the Loki

14:45.680 --> 14:46.680
Rob date.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.680
Have I won?

14:47.680 --> 14:48.680
I'll work something out.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.280
I'll make them buy me dinner still.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.280
Don't worry.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.280
All right.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.480
So, stay tuned for that after the show tonight.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.520
That's really all I got for housekeeping other than, you know, stay on top of our communities.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.360
We love having more folks on our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal

15:02.360 --> 15:04.120
and our MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.680
I always neglect to mention Facebook, but we do have a group on there at the OL Army,

15:07.680 --> 15:09.200
so just search for OLRMY.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.400
You'll find it, or Orange Lounge Radio will come up as well.

15:11.400 --> 15:15.440
Sorry, Facebook, but there's just so goddamn many apps on Facebook.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.520
Every day I'm getting some freaking request for, like, so-and-so wants to play Vampire

15:19.520 --> 15:20.680
with you and suck your blood.

15:20.680 --> 15:21.680
I'm like, bleh!

15:21.680 --> 15:22.680
Sorry.

15:22.680 --> 15:23.680
It's like, yeah.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.680
Thanks, Drew.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.680
All right.

15:25.680 --> 15:26.680
So, there you have it.

15:26.680 --> 15:31.080
Also, the Guitar Hero OL Army fell out of the top 100 this week, and that makes me a

15:31.080 --> 15:32.080
sad panda.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.440
So, we need more recruits for the Guitar Hero OL Army.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.560
You can find us on GuitarHero.com.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.320
You can just search for OL Army.

15:37.320 --> 15:42.080
However, I will say that Richie Maniac still has the number one spot on my Xbox Live list.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.160
He's on my list, and he's on the Guitar Hero OL Army, and he has, like, a million groupies.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.040
Damn you and your achievement horse.

15:48.040 --> 15:53.320
I think he has 2,500 groupies, which is definitely the highest I've seen, so good job.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.520
All right.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.040
Let's get into some gaming news, then.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.680
Who's gonna start us off tonight?

15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
Loki?

15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
Yeah.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.680
I'm gonna start us off.

16:00.680 --> 16:07.640
Anyways, as we kind of teased in the intro there, the Romantics, a wonderful 80s band,

16:07.640 --> 16:15.160
I guess, I'll, yeah, I'm being sarcastic there, they are suing over a cover version

16:15.160 --> 16:22.180
of their song, What I Like About You, that appeared in Guitar Hero Encore Rocks the 80s,

16:22.180 --> 16:26.520
because apparently, the song sounds too much like them.

16:26.520 --> 16:34.120
They want the game sales to be halted, and want accounting of all profits from the game,

16:34.120 --> 16:41.640
along with unspecified compensation and punitive damages.

16:41.640 --> 16:47.000
So apparently, their claim is that the song is virtually indistinguishable from the authentic

16:47.000 --> 16:50.800
version, and therefore would confuse the consumer.

16:50.800 --> 16:59.720
But, you know, I don't know, it's like, I'm just thinking, if it's virtually indistinguishable,

16:59.720 --> 17:00.720
then what's it matter?

17:00.720 --> 17:05.640
It sounds like crap, and people are thinking that's the real song.

17:05.640 --> 17:10.880
And after that, they're going to sue everyone who five stars on an expert.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.400
You know, I would think that in the court of law, it's gonna come down, and the judge

17:15.400 --> 17:19.160
is gonna say, can't we just all agree that this song is so 20 years ago, and you all

17:19.160 --> 17:20.560
need to get over it?

17:20.560 --> 17:24.960
Or the fact that they probably paid to have the licensing of that song, because I'm sure

17:24.960 --> 17:29.880
even though they didn't get the real artist to sing it, they have the license, the rights

17:29.880 --> 17:30.880
to the song.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.360
Do you think it's one of those cases where, like, the record company signed it over without

17:35.360 --> 17:36.360
them knowing?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.360
Like, that type of thing?

17:37.360 --> 17:38.360
Well, I'm not surprised there.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.360
Exactly.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.120
Didn't a similar thing happen in DDR?

17:41.120 --> 17:42.120
Um, possibly.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.760
Someone was saying, like, Strictly Business, but I don't see how that, that's a licensed

17:45.760 --> 17:49.760
song off of, um, well, the thing was, well, the thing was Strictly Business is that the

17:49.760 --> 17:53.320
original artist of the song never consented to the song being in the game, and one of

17:53.320 --> 17:57.560
the artists went into an arcade one day and saw people playing the song, and was like,

17:57.560 --> 17:58.860
what the hell is this?

17:58.860 --> 18:02.680
We never said the song could be in the game, so it was, but the record company did it.

18:02.680 --> 18:06.160
You know, Rob, they didn't raise much of a fuss when it was in, uh, Karaoke Revolution

18:06.160 --> 18:07.160
Party.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.160
Interesting.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.200
And again, it wasn't a very good cover.

18:10.200 --> 18:15.200
And plus, Karaoke Revolution doesn't quite have that pop culture recognizability that

18:15.200 --> 18:16.200
Guitar Hero does.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.440
Let's actually listen.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.440
Let's hear some clips.

18:18.440 --> 18:23.100
Here's the original version of What I Like About You by The Romantics.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.100
It's buffering.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.100
It's a little slow.

18:25.100 --> 18:38.640
Okay, that song's still kind of fun.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.640
I have to admit.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.920
I'll bounce up and down.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.600
All right, let's listen to what the cover sounds like.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.080
This is by The Wave Group, and you actually can't get this in iTunes.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.560
I'm just getting the clips actually right out of iTunes as well.

18:49.560 --> 19:09.400
You know, I've got to say, it really does sound a lot similar.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.400
No, it doesn't.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.400
A little bit.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.520
A little bit.

19:12.520 --> 19:13.520
Not even close.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.520
Pursuing over that?

19:14.520 --> 19:16.520
What a crock.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.920
Well, let's see.

19:17.920 --> 19:18.920
Let's see.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.240
Now, keep in mind, there's other bands that cover this.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.080
So I just had a curiosity.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.320
Just like a control, like when you're doing a science degree, you have to have a control.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.400
So let's actually take a look at a completely different cover.

19:31.400 --> 19:37.400
So from the band Kid Pop Rock and Roll Hits, here's the hit crew with What I Like About

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
You.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.400
Oh, shit.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
It's buffering.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
Here we go.

19:41.400 --> 19:59.360
I know, honestly, that's pretty similar too.

19:59.360 --> 20:04.720
I thought Kidz Bop was reserved for cage match punishment.

20:04.720 --> 20:05.720
Make the wording stop.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.720
That wasn't Kidz Bop.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.720
That was not Kidz Bop.

20:07.720 --> 20:08.720
It was Kidz Pop.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.720
Same damn thing.

20:09.720 --> 20:10.720
Big difference.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.720
That's a big fucking difference.

20:11.720 --> 20:16.880
That's a P, not a B. I would also like to point out, ok, I've got one more for you

20:16.880 --> 20:17.880
guys.

20:17.880 --> 20:23.520
This song was also covered on an album called The Barbie Hit Mix.

20:23.520 --> 20:29.600
See, that's Barbie singing.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.280
Ok, I have one question.

20:33.280 --> 20:38.280
How effective is this mic as a bludgeoning instrument of death?

20:38.280 --> 20:44.840
Honestly, the guitars and everything sound very similar.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.400
Why does Barbie look like one of the Olsen twins?

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
I'm wondering too.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.040
I'm looking at the cover of this going, wow, Barbie got really slutty.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.760
So there you have it.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.760
Got really slutty?

20:54.760 --> 20:58.120
Nim in chat says, Barbie is made of plastic, no mouth.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.120
How does she talk?

20:59.120 --> 21:06.240
Same in the way Britney Spears does, you know, all in the same circumstances.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.400
I'll give you a hint kids, it's the devil.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.520
So there you have it.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.400
They're being sued and what do you think, Drew, what do you think, is there any weight

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
to this lawsuit?

21:18.400 --> 21:21.920
Do you think the romantics have a claim here or what?

21:21.920 --> 21:22.920
No.

21:22.920 --> 21:27.560
No, it is not even remotely similar.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.280
It's similar as me singing this song, okay, I mean, seriously.

21:31.280 --> 21:32.280
Oh, oh, would you?

21:32.280 --> 21:33.280
No, I won't.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.280
Sorry, Rob.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.280
You will.

21:35.280 --> 21:41.280
No, it's just, it's stupid.

21:41.280 --> 21:46.800
I say yes, it's similar, but at the same time, somebody who had the rights to this song agreed

21:46.800 --> 21:48.280
to let the song in the game.

21:48.280 --> 21:53.240
I don't, now, if it came out that, you know, the developers got no permission to use this

21:53.240 --> 21:57.840
song whatsoever, then I would say they have a case, but seeing as I'm pretty sure they

21:57.840 --> 22:01.560
got the rights somewhere, you know, whether that be they went directly to the record label

22:01.560 --> 22:05.200
and never approached the band, well, then the band should take that up with the record

22:05.200 --> 22:06.200
label.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.640
Why are you signing our stuff over to video games that are going to remake our songs too

22:08.640 --> 22:12.140
similarly or why didn't you just let them use the original version for more money or

22:12.140 --> 22:13.140
what have you?

22:13.140 --> 22:19.400
I think, you know, if the song was licensed, then go QQ some more romantics.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.440
Or perhaps the band should have a more unique voice that can't be copied so easily.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.800
What the fuck is wrong with that?

22:25.800 --> 22:30.280
DMN Nourishment says in chat, bottom line, sue the record company for signing and not

22:30.280 --> 22:31.280
Activision.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.640
Stop fucking whining.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.040
Nim says there's a difference between similar and same.

22:36.040 --> 22:40.200
If it's a cover, then it's different and they are going to be made a fool of.

22:40.200 --> 22:44.720
Escapist says I want to see Loki pop advertised on late night TV.

22:44.720 --> 22:48.160
And Riddink 360 says Loki should sing it in the Tingle costume.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.960
There you have it.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.320
Lots of love for Loki singing.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.680
I think you could put out an album that would be bigger than Shatner.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.600
I don't want to do that.

22:56.600 --> 23:00.280
Well, not that I could tell you where he can find clips on the internet of Loki singing,

23:00.280 --> 23:01.760
but I'll give you a hint.

23:01.760 --> 23:08.080
Rock band is the topic of our next story and we did something with rock band very recently.

23:08.080 --> 23:12.680
Anyhow, rock band has opened up a store.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.680
That's right.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.040
There's a new store with accessories.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.120
There's a whole drum bag you can actually buy on this story.

23:18.120 --> 23:22.480
It's a $50 bag to basically keep that whole drum set in.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.480
I want that.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.040
It is kind of nice, but it's $50.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.040
I don't care.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.040
I want that.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.040
Is it worth $50, though?

23:28.040 --> 23:29.040
It is worth $50.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.040
Do you know why, though?

23:30.040 --> 23:32.800
Because have you ever tried buying a bag for, like, consoles?

23:32.800 --> 23:35.440
Trust me, I have numerous times.

23:35.440 --> 23:39.880
Those fucking backpacks that they have for the Xbox 360 are, like, $70.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.380
It's fucking ridiculous.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.380
That looks nice.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.920
Yeah, I got to admit, it does look kind of nice, but I don't know.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.440
I mean, like, God, you already spent $170 on the game.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.480
Do you really need to spend $50 more on some stupid characters?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.480
Well, they have.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.720
Like, you can buy actual guitars on that website and shit, like...

23:52.720 --> 23:53.720
Yeah, I know.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.720
There's other memorabilia.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.800
It's like, I just bought $169 worth of fake instruments.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.160
Let's buy some real ones, too.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.160
Yay!

24:01.160 --> 24:06.280
Uh, by the way, before we get to the next story, speaking of Guitar Hero, a little more

24:06.280 --> 24:09.480
Guitar Hero, a little less rock band, did you see that thing?

24:09.480 --> 24:13.280
And Tiger Claw was sharing this with our forum people, and he was asking me about this before

24:13.280 --> 24:14.280
the show.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.080
Did you see that whole Guitar Hero in the blender thing?

24:16.080 --> 24:17.080
I love that website.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.520
They put down the Will It Blend?

24:18.520 --> 24:19.520
They've done Guitar Hero.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.760
That is the question.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.520
And they actually put the controller in the blender.

24:22.520 --> 24:23.960
Well, half of it.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.040
I don't mean to pose spoilers, but yes.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.480
Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.680
I love that website now.

24:30.680 --> 24:31.680
You should check that out.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.080
I giggled my head off watching that.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.080
Rob.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.760
I like how Loki used the appropriate verb.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.000
He didn't laugh.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.600
He giggled when he watched Will It Blend.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
Rob?

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
Yes.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.200
They did put Chuck Norris in the blender on that segment.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.680
Like a cardboard cutout or something?

24:48.680 --> 24:49.680
Action figure.

24:49.680 --> 24:53.480
Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.

24:53.480 --> 24:58.680
I apologize to all listeners for bringing up Chuck, but it had to be done.

24:58.680 --> 25:04.240
I'm telling you, Hail Marys, those people that are behind the marketing of that blender

25:04.240 --> 25:05.640
are fucking geniuses.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.040
That is absolutely the best thing.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.620
That's the entry level blender.

25:10.620 --> 25:12.560
You can get one that's more powerful than that.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.640
You can dispose bodies in that thing.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.640
It's $250.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.640
No one's buying it.

25:18.640 --> 25:19.640
Everyone's watching it.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.640
I thought it was $600.

25:20.640 --> 25:21.640
It used to be $600.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.160
It could be a restaurant caliber thing.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.680
No, it used to be $600 and now it's $399, just like the PS3.

25:27.680 --> 25:34.240
But it can be yours for four low payments of $99.99, just like the PS3 or the iPhone.

25:34.240 --> 25:37.560
Nim in chat, chat.orangelandrager.com, if you're listening to us live on this Sunday

25:37.560 --> 25:40.040
evening says, Chuck Norris doesn't blend.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.000
Chuck Norris blends blenders.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.460
Let's not start this.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.460
I'm sorry.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.460
Yes, please.

25:46.460 --> 25:47.460
Let's not.

25:47.460 --> 25:49.800
Let's move on to the next story, quickly.

25:49.800 --> 25:56.960
Anyways, speaking of blending, someone I'd love to throw into that wonderful high powered

25:56.960 --> 26:03.480
blender, Senator Hillary Clinton and of course some other folks like Joe Lieberman.

26:03.480 --> 26:07.720
These opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the station or other staff

26:07.720 --> 26:08.800
members of Warren's Laundry.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.160
But they're the majority of the studio.

26:12.160 --> 26:20.080
Senator Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Sam Brownback, and even Bay, I guess, have sent

26:20.080 --> 26:28.040
letters to the ESRB asking for a thorough review of Manhunt 2 following the whole, you

26:28.040 --> 26:33.480
know, unlocked content, do the hack in the game.

26:33.480 --> 26:38.760
Apparently they think because they're like political types that the ESRB would go, okey

26:38.760 --> 26:39.760
dokey.

26:39.760 --> 26:44.480
They couldn't do her job the first time or something.

26:44.480 --> 26:49.120
And actually the other thing that they're also wanting done is because they're a little

26:49.120 --> 26:53.560
bit pissed off at the whole Wii controls and how you can murder people using the Wii remote,

26:53.560 --> 26:58.840
they want the Wii games to be rated differently because of such things like that.

26:58.840 --> 27:03.320
So they want that taken into consideration for future ratings.

27:03.320 --> 27:07.240
Because you know you can still aim a gun with a mouse.

27:07.240 --> 27:10.960
Escapist in chat says, sweet Jesus, is Manhunt 2 even selling that well?

27:10.960 --> 27:11.960
My thoughts exactly.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.280
No, I can tell you right now it's not.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.960
Honestly, I don't understand the point of it.

27:17.960 --> 27:22.160
I mean, and doesn't fucking Hillary Clinton have better things to do?

27:22.160 --> 27:23.160
No.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.160
Seriously.

27:24.160 --> 27:29.080
Well, I heard she's running for president.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.000
I know, doesn't she have better things to do?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.080
I really hope she wins.

27:34.080 --> 27:38.360
Well, if I remember right though, it's not just her, but she did band together with these

27:38.360 --> 27:39.360
other folks.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.360
It's a multi-partisan thing.

27:41.360 --> 27:46.560
I think this goes back to the fact that politicians generally are a little bit ignorant about

27:46.560 --> 27:47.560
this stuff.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.120
See, that's why I don't understand this.

27:49.120 --> 27:54.220
Four letters from politicians and they want results, yet if I send them four letters to

27:54.220 --> 27:58.640
shut the fuck up, then you're not going to do it either, so why should they listen to

27:58.640 --> 27:59.640
them?

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
I don't know.

28:00.640 --> 28:05.080
Well, maybe someone the ESRB should listen to is Mr. T, because goddamn it, everybody

28:05.080 --> 28:06.080
should listen to Mr. T.

28:06.080 --> 28:07.080
Right.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.080
Boom.

28:08.080 --> 28:11.000
And if that is true, then everybody will soon own a copy of World of Warcraft, because there

28:11.000 --> 28:15.680
are brand new commercials featuring Mr. T and William Shatner for World of Warcraft.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.680
Hilarious.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.680
And they're pretty...

28:17.680 --> 28:18.680
Like the Night Elf Mohawk.

28:18.680 --> 28:22.240
They're very interesting, because yeah, in the commercial, and I'm not going to play

28:22.240 --> 28:27.680
it because Blizzard isn't paying us to play it, but in the commercial, Mr. T talks about

28:27.680 --> 28:32.800
how he fantasizes himself as a Night Elf Mohawk, even though there isn't actually a Mohawk

28:32.800 --> 28:33.800
in the game.

28:33.800 --> 28:37.800
And William Shatner is a shaman, a torn shaman, which is a very interesting one.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.960
Go figure, he's been nerfed to hell.

28:41.960 --> 28:45.000
Apparently Mini-Me has filmed a commercial as well.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.080
Verne Troyer has also filmed one.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.960
I hope to God he's a gnome.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.320
You better believe he's a gnome.

28:51.320 --> 28:52.320
That's all I have to say.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.320
I hope to God he's a gnome.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.320
No, I think they're going to do the ironic thing where he's going to play a very tall

28:55.320 --> 28:56.320
character.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.920
He's going to die.

28:57.920 --> 28:58.920
Lame.

28:58.920 --> 29:03.360
I already got Shatner as a Torrin.

29:03.360 --> 29:11.000
See here, on a completely different note, Warcraft may be taking over PCs, but one game

29:11.000 --> 29:16.480
that's taking over PlayStation 3 would be Warhawk, and they're getting their first expansion

29:16.480 --> 29:17.480
here pretty soon.

29:17.480 --> 29:23.480
It's supposed to be out sometime during December, and it's going to be called Operation Omega

29:23.480 --> 29:24.480
Dawn.

29:24.480 --> 29:25.480
Lame title.

29:25.480 --> 29:34.640
And it's going to be filled with some cool stuff, including new vehicles, a KT-424 combat

29:34.640 --> 29:40.600
drop ship, and a new battlefield, the Omega Factory, and there's going to be some nighttime

29:40.600 --> 29:42.520
based battles as well.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.520
So...

29:43.520 --> 29:44.520
Oh.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.920
A few cliched titles.

29:46.920 --> 29:53.440
Well, it's nice to see that they're expanding their games, what few they have, so more power

29:53.440 --> 29:54.440
to them.

29:54.440 --> 29:55.440
I agree.

29:55.440 --> 30:00.240
I mean, there's a lot of dumb titles out there in video gaming, so titles aren't everything,

30:00.240 --> 30:03.280
it's the gameplay that's going to be important in this expansion.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.200
And Chat, I love you guys, we're already subverting it.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.200
What?

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
What did they say in Chatroom?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.200
They're already subverting it.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.200
Who?

30:10.200 --> 30:11.200
They're already subverting the title name.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.200
Who and what?

30:12.200 --> 30:13.200
Chatroom.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.200
Who, specifically, and what?

30:14.200 --> 30:21.600
We have Nim calling it Omega Dump, Sashil Omega Dumb, Omega Dong, Omega Gong.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.520
How mature!

30:24.520 --> 30:26.000
Omega Penis!

30:26.000 --> 30:30.560
Whoa, did we just make our first penis joke.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.440
Probably not the last.

30:32.440 --> 30:40.360
Speaking of jokes, the PlayStation 3 version of the Orange Box may be pretty hilarious.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.560
Apparently the...

30:41.560 --> 30:44.720
Thank you, Drew, for that very scary maniacal laughter.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.040
What the hell was that?

30:46.040 --> 30:47.280
That was my evil laugh.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
That apparently was the evil...

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
Wow.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.480
That was the evil, I am laughing at you, PS3.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.480
Oh, I'm a little scared about this.

30:54.480 --> 31:01.360
Anyhow, the Orange Box is actually, it's not being ported by Valve, who were doing the

31:01.360 --> 31:03.360
PC and 360 versions.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.160
Apparently another team at EA has taken upon it to actually port this game over to the

31:07.160 --> 31:12.640
PlayStation 3, and the earlier reports are saying, not that great.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.200
Were they the team behind, like, Superman Returns?

31:15.200 --> 31:18.240
Oh, God, I hope not.

31:18.240 --> 31:24.440
Apparently there are a number of frame rate hiccups and other technical issues, which,

31:24.440 --> 31:31.680
quote, at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.840
You know, what's interesting is if you think about other things you might have read about,

31:34.840 --> 31:40.320
Gabe Newell, who's one of the co-founders of Valve, he's openly voiced previously, he's

31:40.320 --> 31:43.200
not really big on the PlayStation 3.

31:43.200 --> 31:46.600
He's called it directly a waste of everybody's time.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.760
Oh, snap.

31:48.760 --> 31:54.080
However, you know, the Orange Box is a pretty awesome game, which, well, going off of what

31:54.080 --> 31:55.080
I've heard.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.360
But Loki certainly said a lot of great things about Orange Box.

31:57.360 --> 32:01.000
Dark Sakura loves her some Portal, she's gone frickin' crazy with Portal.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.200
I will be playing Orange Box this week, though, because Loki's loamiest copy, so I'll let

32:04.200 --> 32:06.000
you know next week.

32:06.000 --> 32:11.560
But you know, whenever great games get disgraced like that, it makes us a little bit angsty.

32:11.560 --> 32:30.440
And when we get angsty, the F.U. music comes in and we do our rants.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.260
I'd actually like to start tonight because I'm reading chat.

32:33.260 --> 32:39.280
I'm gonna give an F.U. to Nim, who said, Omega, two girls, one cup.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.880
Seriously.

32:40.880 --> 32:41.880
Let it go.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.340
Seriously, let it go on both ends of that.

32:44.340 --> 32:48.000
I don't really have anything else to really say F.U. to, so I guess you get that.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.560
F.U. to sleeping until one today, that was pretty awesome.

32:51.560 --> 32:59.000
Loki, F.U. to being sick, being stuffed up and all the other fun stuff that goes along

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
with it.

33:00.000 --> 33:07.240
But, I'm gonna take tomorrow off, because I'm not feeling that well, so, you know.

33:07.240 --> 33:11.040
You show them, I'm gonna take tomorrow off, damn straight.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.440
Are you gonna play games while you're sick, or are you just gonna sleep, or what?

33:14.440 --> 33:18.160
Fuck yeah, I'm playing games, that's probably what I'm gonna do.

33:18.160 --> 33:20.880
Drew, do you have any F.U.s of the week you'd like to share?

33:20.880 --> 33:24.120
F.U. to Loki's SARS.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.120
I don't have SARS.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.120
I hope it's not contagious.

33:27.120 --> 33:33.600
F.U. to people in Battlefield 2 who insist I fly a helicopter even though I have no idea

33:33.600 --> 33:35.040
how to fly a helicopter.

33:35.040 --> 33:40.840
F.U. to not having all these wonderful PC games that are coming out lately, and F.U.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.840
to not being able to feed my wow addiction.

33:42.840 --> 33:47.400
Well, you just need to have, you know, Tank upload a program for you to learn how to fly

33:47.400 --> 33:48.400
a combat helicopter.

33:48.400 --> 33:51.360
Ooh, points for the Matrix reference.

33:51.360 --> 33:55.600
Alright, I guess that's gonna do it for the F.U.s of the week.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.480
Incredibly nerdy, thanks to Drew being here.

33:57.480 --> 34:01.320
You know what's funny is, we're having that guy, Joe Pantalone, I think, coming in.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.000
The guy that played Cypher.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
He's coming in to our work.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.240
But that guy, he's that guy, you don't really know his name, but like in every mob movie

34:08.240 --> 34:09.240
he plays.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.240
A mob guy.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.240
A mob guy, yeah, yeah.

34:11.240 --> 34:13.240
Or he plays, or he, no.

34:13.240 --> 34:16.680
Well, I don't know where, how do you put it?

34:16.680 --> 34:17.680
What was that movie?

34:17.680 --> 34:18.680
Memento.

34:18.680 --> 34:26.320
Yes, he's in Memento, and Sopranos, and, oddly enough, The Princess Diaries.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.200
Not that I watched that movie or anything.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.680
The wife probably made you do it.

34:31.680 --> 34:37.640
It was one of those, uh, remotes way over there, it's stuck on the family channel, and

34:37.640 --> 34:41.520
I'm like, fuck, I don't want to get up, but, lazy!

34:41.520 --> 34:43.840
I almost watched The Princess Diaries.

34:43.840 --> 34:47.080
I finally got up when it, you know, finished the movie, and then it started playing The

34:47.080 --> 34:48.080
Princess Diaries again.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.080
And you were crying.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.720
I was like, I don't want to watch this again!

34:51.720 --> 34:52.720
Horrible.

34:52.720 --> 34:53.720
Okay, so what, he's going to your work?

34:53.720 --> 34:55.440
Are you going to get an Orange Lounge Radio autograph?

34:55.440 --> 34:56.440
You should.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.200
Um, I don't know why he's autographing, he's coming in for this movie.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.640
We need more stuff in the studio.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.640
I know.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.640
Future studio.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.640
I know.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.240
Coolists are fucking, like, lame.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.240
They don't want him autographing certain things.

35:06.240 --> 35:09.120
I wanted to bring in, like, a Matrix poster for him to sign, but...

35:09.120 --> 35:10.640
I still vote for the steak dinner.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.640
I don't know.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.440
Alright, let's get back to the news.

35:13.440 --> 35:19.760
So, yeah, you know, there's not a lot of games for girls out there that are really good,

35:19.760 --> 35:20.880
but guess what?

35:20.880 --> 35:25.000
That's not going to be the case anymore, Fleece, if you own a phone.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.840
There's going to be a game called The Coolest Girl in School, which is being pitched as

35:29.840 --> 35:35.200
Grand Theft Auto for girls, and it's being developed by, um, Champagne...

35:35.200 --> 35:36.200
What?

35:36.200 --> 35:38.760
Is that the actual company?

35:38.760 --> 35:42.040
Okay, I'm sorry, but this is the actual company.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.280
Developed by Champagne for the Ladies is the name of the...

35:46.280 --> 35:47.960
Loki, this sounds right up your alley.

35:47.960 --> 35:48.960
Champagne for the Ladies?

35:48.960 --> 35:51.960
What kind of a fucking development team is that?

35:51.960 --> 35:56.280
This sounds like the candy that strangers use to get people in their cars.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
I mean...

35:57.280 --> 35:58.280
Oh, but it gets better.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.760
I got Champagne for the Ladies.

36:00.760 --> 36:05.800
Every place is all the boyish drug running and random violence with stuff girls like.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.840
Like experimenting with drugs, using sex...

36:08.840 --> 36:09.840
What?

36:09.840 --> 36:15.840
Using sexuality for personal gain, inclined to the top of the social order, by any means

36:15.840 --> 36:16.840
necessary.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.900
Shut the fuck up, where is this from?

36:18.900 --> 36:19.900
Is this for real?

36:19.900 --> 36:28.720
Yeah, it's, um, you can gossip, shoplifting, uh, game, you know, all sorts of things like

36:28.720 --> 36:29.720
that.

36:29.720 --> 36:40.840
Anyways, uh, Grisby in chat says, uh, Grand Theft Auto, Ho Island.

36:40.840 --> 36:41.840
Now that's degrading.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.200
Uh, it's degrading.

36:43.200 --> 36:48.360
Apparently there's a report, though, on Canada.com, yes, they are so cool, they have their own

36:48.360 --> 36:49.360
.com.

36:49.360 --> 36:55.720
Um, they're writing that, uh, while the Australian Family Association deems the game toxic, uh,

36:55.720 --> 37:03.360
and Christine Devitt of the Montreal's Concordia University calls it corrosive, that's not

37:03.360 --> 37:06.880
really a description for a game, the folks at Champ...

37:06.880 --> 37:07.880
Insert blame Canada jokes here.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.960
Oh my god, it is, that is the actual development name for the company.

37:10.960 --> 37:15.360
The folks at Champagne for the Ladies say it's all good fun.

37:15.360 --> 37:20.320
First off, I'm sorry, but no one's going to take a company named Champagne for the Ladies,

37:20.320 --> 37:21.320
seriously.

37:21.320 --> 37:25.880
GS-191 has an interesting point, it's the Winona Ryder Simulator.

37:25.880 --> 37:32.840
Uh, this is more of like a Britney Spears simulator, drugs ruin your life and all that

37:32.840 --> 37:33.840
stuff, my god.

37:33.840 --> 37:39.480
But, like, I don't know, tell me if it's just me, but isn't there, like, a sick side of

37:39.480 --> 37:44.360
you that, like, kind of wants to play it when it's all said and done, like, I'm kinda like,

37:44.360 --> 37:48.000
you know, it's like one of those things, like, I have to play it, like, before I die.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
You know what?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.840
Take two, pay attention to what they're doing in this game, that way you can add a female

37:52.840 --> 37:57.240
character into Grand Theft Auto that you can play, and there you go, that's what women

37:57.240 --> 37:58.240
like.

37:58.240 --> 38:03.200
Women like using sexuality for personal games, and doing all this stuff like that.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.640
When Jamie's not here, this is what happens.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.640
The show gets ruined.

38:06.640 --> 38:07.640
Alright, uh...

38:07.640 --> 38:11.160
Since the girl-centered role-playing game puts magnifying glass into the darker side

38:11.160 --> 38:16.960
of school life with participants encouraged to experiment with fashion, oh, experiment

38:16.960 --> 38:27.040
with fashion, oh no, fashion, drugs, sexuality, cutting class, and spreading rumors, oh, spreading

38:27.040 --> 38:28.040
rumors.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.040
Anyways.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.880
Frisbee asks, what would Jamie's comments on this be?

38:32.880 --> 38:33.880
I don't have a clue.

38:33.880 --> 38:38.520
If we get her on the phone later, we'll have to watch, I really don't know.

38:38.520 --> 38:45.600
She would probably be making some sort of noise similar to this.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.640
That's I think what Jamie would do.

38:49.640 --> 38:50.640
Call me crazy.

38:50.640 --> 38:58.400
Anyhow, let's get back into some real games, such as a real gamer girl, Lara Croft.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.600
And I say that because Lara Croft has big boobs.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.240
No, just kidding.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.500
But of course, Lara Croft is much more of a hero than any of the characters in that

39:05.500 --> 39:06.640
other game ever will be.

39:06.640 --> 39:14.880
Lara Croft has come out with Tomb Raider Anniversary on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

39:14.880 --> 39:18.320
It's actually available for 1,200 Microsoft points, that's going to set you back about

39:18.320 --> 39:19.320
15 bucks.

39:19.320 --> 39:22.980
Here's the thing though, you need to own Tomb Raider Legend in order to play it because

39:22.980 --> 39:25.520
it's technically downloadable content for that.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.560
But if you want to download the Tomb Raider Anniversary, check that out.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.360
It's available on the Xbox 360 right now.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.360
Yay.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.960
Actually, I think that's only the first half of the game.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.880
I think it's going to be two halves, they're about 1,200 points each.

39:35.880 --> 39:38.000
Well, then there you have it.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.480
But if you don't like that, you can spend an extra 10 bucks and buy the disc.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.560
So what's Lara Croft's equivalent of horse armor?

39:46.560 --> 39:51.440
Or better yet, just wait a few months because this game isn't that great to begin with and

39:51.440 --> 39:54.280
wait for the drop in price.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.880
Does download content drop in price that much?

39:55.880 --> 39:56.880
I guess so.

39:56.880 --> 39:57.880
No, I'm talking about buying...

39:57.880 --> 39:58.880
I bought Carcassonne and then it was free like four months later.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.720
I'm talking about buying the disc version of the game.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.320
Oh, I gotcha.

40:04.320 --> 40:11.000
Anyways, speaking of Xbox Live stuff, if you live in Europe, they're going to be offering

40:11.000 --> 40:17.720
you instead of Halo 3 for buying an Xbox 360, 10 free Xbox Live arcade games for new European

40:17.720 --> 40:21.760
Xbox 360 owners and a friend.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.760
Let's see here.

40:22.760 --> 40:31.320
Now, what you can do, if you buy a console between October 1st and December 14th, you

40:31.320 --> 40:37.240
can fill out a form and then both you and a friend can get 10 free Xbox Live arcade

40:37.240 --> 40:41.320
games, which, to be honest, aren't that bad.

40:41.320 --> 40:47.440
It's a pretty good selection, including Every Extend Extra Extreme, Sonic the Hedgehog,

40:47.440 --> 40:53.400
Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting, Bomberman Live, Marble Blast Ultra, Spy Glass Board

40:53.400 --> 41:00.600
Games, Small Arms, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures, Assault Heroes, and Zuma Deluxe.

41:00.600 --> 41:01.600
Hey, it's free.

41:01.600 --> 41:02.600
It's not bad.

41:02.600 --> 41:03.600
That's not bad at all.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.680
We don't have anything comparable like here in the U.S.

41:05.680 --> 41:09.320
Well, maybe like the arcade bundle has the five games with it.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.960
Yeah, but a little different.

41:11.960 --> 41:12.960
Interesting.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.560
Well, lucky those folks over in Europe.

41:15.560 --> 41:19.080
Also, let's get into some release dates and talk about Europe first.

41:19.080 --> 41:22.760
Jamie's not here, but I've got you covered on what is coming out in Europe.

41:22.760 --> 41:27.420
I imagine now that the holidays are over, things are slowing down in terms of release

41:27.420 --> 41:29.040
dates, but apparently not.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.320
There's still a lot of stuff coming out on the 30th over in Europe.

41:32.320 --> 41:40.060
We have a port of Alvin and the Chipmunks, which is a translation of that Oscar award-winning

41:40.060 --> 41:41.060
movie that's coming out.

41:41.060 --> 41:42.060
It's a music game.

41:42.060 --> 41:43.060
Is it a music game for real?

41:43.060 --> 41:47.240
It's not karaoke though, but it's a rhythm music game.

41:47.240 --> 41:52.840
There's rhythm music games that are good, like DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, then there's

41:52.840 --> 41:53.840
these types of music games.

41:53.840 --> 41:54.840
This isn't going to be one of them.

41:54.840 --> 41:55.840
Yeah, exactly.

41:55.840 --> 41:59.200
Alvin and Chipmunks comes out on the 30th on the DS and the Wii.

41:59.200 --> 42:04.080
BlackSight Area 51 makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360, also on the 30th.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.920
Boogie finally makes its way to Europe on PlayStation 2 and the DS this week.

42:07.920 --> 42:10.720
Cruisin comes out on the Wii, I'm sure you can skip that.

42:10.720 --> 42:15.960
Football Manager for the PSP comes out, as well as Guitar Hero 3 comes out on the PC

42:15.960 --> 42:16.960
this week.

42:16.960 --> 42:21.400
I believe it already came out on the consoles last week, because I've seen, yeah, it must

42:21.400 --> 42:25.800
come out last week, because I saw some British folks joining the OL Army.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.240
Genga comes out on the DS on the 30th.

42:28.240 --> 42:31.920
Medal of Honor for the PSP also comes out on the 30th.

42:31.920 --> 42:35.360
Pro Evo Soccer 2008 for the PSP also on the 30th.

42:35.360 --> 42:39.760
Puzzle Quest comes out on the PlayStation 2, Resident Evil the Umbrella Chronicles on

42:39.760 --> 42:46.240
the Wii, Speedball 2 on the PC, Siphon Filter on the PSP, The Golden Compass on Damn Near

42:46.240 --> 42:51.600
Every System, again another kind of gaming port of a movie, and lastly, but certainly

42:51.600 --> 42:59.440
not leastly, My Horse and Me on the PC, developed by Atari, and you wonder why their CEO recently

42:59.440 --> 43:01.440
left the company.

43:01.440 --> 43:06.360
Anyways, for the US there's really not a whole lot coming out this week.

43:06.360 --> 43:12.360
On the DS, I don't know why they're releasing this game, but Master of Illusion, it's a

43:12.360 --> 43:17.440
magic trick training sim or something like that.

43:17.440 --> 43:21.960
It teaches you how to do card tricks, and you do magic with your DS.

43:21.960 --> 43:22.960
Who's gonna be...

43:22.960 --> 43:25.720
Oh my god, and it's fucking full-priced?

43:25.720 --> 43:26.720
That's got to be different.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.640
We just stole $34 out of your wallet.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.640
That's magic!

43:29.640 --> 43:30.640
That's a...

43:30.640 --> 43:33.040
Well, if you're buying it from GameStop, it's full-priced, but it's not...

43:33.040 --> 43:34.040
Two words.

43:34.040 --> 43:35.040
It's supposed to be $20.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.040
Two words.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.440
Ping Pals.

43:37.440 --> 43:44.760
Cranium Kabuki, if you like that trivia game, normally a board game, you can buy that from

43:44.760 --> 43:51.280
Ubisoft on the Wii, Boogie is coming out on the DS this week, also Geometry Wars Galaxies

43:51.280 --> 44:02.440
on the DS, History Channel Battle for the Pacific on the Wii, and indoor sports from

44:02.440 --> 44:06.720
Konami, although that's not coming out, that's next year.

44:06.720 --> 44:16.320
Well, they list it as, because we have some more current dates than they do, that's it.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.320
It's really...

44:17.320 --> 44:21.200
I imagine it's probably a much slower week here, thanks to Black Friday being over.

44:21.200 --> 44:25.680
Did they actually venture out on Black Friday, out of curiosity?

44:25.680 --> 44:28.120
I did later on in the evening.

44:28.120 --> 44:33.640
I went to GameStop around 2 to pick up the Wings of the Goddess, and it wasn't that bad.

44:33.640 --> 44:35.920
They were adequately staffed, I'll tell you that.

44:35.920 --> 44:37.600
They had people walking the floor and everything.

44:37.600 --> 44:43.480
I went and bought Zola, and the Zapper, you know what's weird though?

44:43.480 --> 44:48.600
The Zapper, from what we've, you know, the press release said it was supposed to be $20,

44:48.600 --> 44:56.560
and my company, we're selling it, it's $20 retail, GameStop is selling it for $25.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.080
Oh ho ho ho!

44:58.080 --> 44:59.080
Everywhere.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.080
Interesting.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.080
Chop around for the best deal?

45:01.080 --> 45:04.240
No, I spent $25 because I'm lazy.

45:04.240 --> 45:08.720
I don't know, it's wasted $25 right there, but yeah, we'll get into that later.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.920
Alright, let's get into some Japanese release dates.

45:10.920 --> 45:18.680
Assassin's Creed comes out in Japan, the localized version for the Xbox 360 from Ubisoft.

45:18.680 --> 45:23.120
Apocalypse Desire Next is a new game on the Xbox 360.

45:23.120 --> 45:27.440
It is a strategy-based game, and it doesn't look like anything we have over here.

45:27.440 --> 45:29.920
Just trying to take a look at some screenshots real quick.

45:29.920 --> 45:34.760
Looks like it might be a tactical type of game.

45:34.760 --> 45:35.760
Trying to look here.

45:35.760 --> 45:39.520
Oh yes, definitely more of a tactical-based type of game, so check that out.

45:39.520 --> 45:43.640
If you like those games, Apocalypse Desire Next, also coming out this week in Japan.

45:43.640 --> 45:50.080
On the Wii, Swing Golf, Pangea Second Shot is coming out, which I'm sure is just kind

45:50.080 --> 45:53.960
of Nintendo's version of Hot Shots Golf, or Who We Trying to Kid is just another rip-off

45:53.960 --> 45:55.860
of a Wii Sports title.

45:55.860 --> 46:02.820
Also coming out on the Wii, Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes on the Wii, coming out from Capcom.

46:02.820 --> 46:08.080
Also coming out in Japan, Tony Hawk's Project 8 on the PlayStation 3.

46:08.080 --> 46:13.400
Star Train Your Past Makes Your Future on the PlayStation 2 from Princess Soft.

46:13.400 --> 46:18.440
Yep, you can get a limited edition of that game as well if you follow every Princess

46:18.440 --> 46:19.680
Soft title.

46:19.680 --> 46:26.360
Speaking of Princesses on the Nintendo DS, Disney Princesses Magical Jewels comes out

46:26.360 --> 46:28.840
in Japan.

46:28.840 --> 46:31.960
I don't know exactly what their magical jewels are, but I don't want to find out.

46:31.960 --> 46:37.600
Cats 2 comes out of the Nintendo DS in Japan, another cat simulation game, because apparently

46:37.600 --> 46:43.920
Cats 1 with a Z, that's Cats with a Z, was so popular there is now a Cats 2.

46:43.920 --> 46:50.800
Fuku Mori, Mori No Unhappy Project is coming out from Bandai also on the Nintendo DS, and

46:50.800 --> 46:52.860
I have no idea what this game is all about.

46:52.860 --> 46:58.160
Looks like it could be another mix of mini-games, it's hard to tell from the screenshots, it's

46:58.160 --> 47:01.520
an action-based game, probably a typical platformer.

47:01.520 --> 47:02.520
What's so damn funny?

47:02.520 --> 47:03.520
Is it chat?

47:03.520 --> 47:04.520
It's chat.

47:04.520 --> 47:06.080
What are they saying in chat, Drew?

47:06.080 --> 47:08.000
Oh, typical DMN.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.480
Princess Soft, doesn't Rob work for them?

47:10.480 --> 47:12.760
Hahaha, funny.

47:12.760 --> 47:18.560
Coming on the PSP, Disgaea Hour of Darkness Portable coming out, the portable version

47:18.560 --> 47:23.160
of the popular strategy game, that's going to do it for Japanese release dates.

47:23.160 --> 47:24.160
Awesome.

47:24.160 --> 47:29.840
Anyways, one thing that's supposedly coming soon to the Wii, which is weird because I

47:29.840 --> 47:35.160
never thought I would, but the Unreal 3 engine is apparently being adapted for the Wii by

47:35.160 --> 47:37.560
some unnamed company.

47:37.560 --> 47:41.880
They're porting it over much like I guess they did with the Unreal 2 engine.

47:41.880 --> 47:47.480
Oh, Ubisoft ported over the Unreal 2 engine for Red Steel.

47:47.480 --> 47:51.280
So is it coming over for Red Steel 2, maybe?

47:51.280 --> 47:52.280
I don't know.

47:52.280 --> 47:55.560
Because isn't the rumors that that game is supposed to be made?

47:55.560 --> 47:56.560
It is.

47:56.560 --> 47:57.560
Hopefully it doesn't suck as much as the first one.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.760
Yeah, maybe they can make it right this time.

48:00.760 --> 48:01.760
I don't know.

48:01.760 --> 48:10.040
You know, you've heard my opinion on Ubisoft ports for Wii.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.400
I tried to stay away from them.

48:11.400 --> 48:13.000
But we don't know for sure it's them.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.060
It's an unnamed company that's doing it, but it's just kind of one of those, you know,

48:16.060 --> 48:19.040
if you were betting, odds would favor this.

48:19.040 --> 48:23.440
I think they could probably do it if they did something like cel-shaded or something

48:23.440 --> 48:27.640
like that, very simple like Wind Waker type graphics, where you simplify and you'll have

48:27.640 --> 48:31.280
all these textures and stuff you have to worry about, you could probably pump some interesting

48:31.280 --> 48:33.200
stuff out on the Unreal engine.

48:33.200 --> 48:37.060
Xenocore in chat says, why adapt Unreal Tournament 3 for the Wii?

48:37.060 --> 48:38.060
What the fuck?

48:38.060 --> 48:41.600
I'm obviously speaking about the engine in general, not the game.

48:41.600 --> 48:43.560
Again, it's money.

48:43.560 --> 48:48.280
If a company can port their game to multiple systems this way, they'll do it.

48:48.280 --> 48:53.520
And if they can successfully port Unreal Engine over for the Wii, then they can sell that

48:53.520 --> 48:58.280
to other companies, you know, to make Wii versions of stuff using the Unreal 3 engine.

48:58.280 --> 49:01.480
And plus, you know, with just the Wii selling as crazy as it is, you know, if you've probably

49:01.480 --> 49:07.120
seen the stories on Black Friday, people are still going crazy about the Nintendo Wii,

49:07.120 --> 49:09.400
and it's, you know, it's kind of a different demographic.

49:09.400 --> 49:13.300
You know, the more family household, quote unquote, is where the Nintendo Wiis are going.

49:13.300 --> 49:16.920
So certainly if there is a particular game that they want to try and get a piece of that

49:16.920 --> 49:22.720
audience with that type of, you know, share of the marketplace, they'll go for it.

49:22.720 --> 49:28.960
Anyhow, let's take this opportunity to dive into the mailbag and take a look at some of

49:28.960 --> 49:31.320
the emails that we've gotten this week.

49:31.320 --> 49:34.320
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbagorangelaunchradio.com.

49:34.320 --> 49:39.480
Mark Sakura will usually take on these responsibilities, but since she's not here, I stole the password

49:39.480 --> 49:46.800
to the mailbag and I'm looking in her place.

49:46.800 --> 49:51.160
Let's look at email number one tonight of four emails we're reading tonight.

49:51.160 --> 49:56.280
Email number one comes to us from Arvid, who didn't use a handle, so I called him by his

49:56.280 --> 49:57.280
real name.

49:57.280 --> 49:59.480
And Arvid says, greetings, just a quick question.

49:59.480 --> 50:03.560
What is the song called that you play at the end of the show, and from what game is it?

50:03.560 --> 50:05.760
Sorry if this has already been answered in the forums.

50:05.760 --> 50:10.280
The song at the end of the program that you will hear in a little while when we finish

50:10.280 --> 50:23.960
is iFutureList by Kiriyama Oka, which I believe appeared in DDR Supernova in the US for a

50:23.960 --> 50:24.960
console game.

50:24.960 --> 50:27.200
I thought it was Xtreme 2 also.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.200
Was it in Xtreme 2?

50:28.200 --> 50:29.840
I thought it was Supernova.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.460
And I'm sure one of the Bahmani nerds in the chat knows for sure, but it made its first

50:32.460 --> 50:34.440
appearance in one of the 2DX games.

50:34.440 --> 50:39.400
I want to say 2DX 13th?

50:39.400 --> 50:40.400
I don't remember.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.400
It's been a long time.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.400
I stopped tracking after 8th.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.540
And it shows up in various Bahmani games.

50:45.540 --> 50:52.480
Let's go to the next email coming to us from Chard, also known as Rick the UK fanboy.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.720
Hey guys, do you have a postage address?

50:54.720 --> 50:58.360
We're going through a mass tidy at our house and I have to throw out a lot of my stuff.

50:58.360 --> 51:00.640
I've come across some things that might be fun to send you.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.360
A Christmas present maybe.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.840
Oh, I like presents.

51:04.840 --> 51:10.240
As long as it's not a B-O-M-B, then I guess I'm okay with giving out the address.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.240
So we'll see.

51:11.240 --> 51:15.560
Yeah, sure, I'll reply to that and find out, but there's another part of this.

51:15.560 --> 51:17.120
I wouldn't have read this on air if that was it.

51:17.120 --> 51:18.120
There is another part of this.

51:18.120 --> 51:20.080
Anyway, I also have a question.

51:20.080 --> 51:24.840
Which game were you so excited to get and when it came out was the biggest disappointment?

51:24.840 --> 51:28.760
If you could go back in time and hit the developer over the head with a big comedy inflatable

51:28.760 --> 51:31.480
hammer, what would you get them to change?

51:31.480 --> 51:36.080
Cheerio, governor, chimney, cup of tea, telly, and all that stuff.

51:36.080 --> 51:40.920
Well, he is our UK fanboy, so you forgot crumpets.

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
You forgot crumpets.

51:41.920 --> 51:46.680
Hope you had a good turkey day or whatever the devil it is you Americans celebrate.

51:46.680 --> 51:47.680
This is Thanksgiving.

51:47.680 --> 51:49.240
I don't know.

51:49.240 --> 51:52.840
A game that came out and you were extremely disappointed in it.

51:52.840 --> 51:53.840
Actually I can...

51:53.840 --> 51:54.840
It's easy.

51:54.840 --> 51:55.840
I know right off the top of my head what it is.

51:55.840 --> 51:57.720
I can think of one right now.

51:57.720 --> 51:59.720
Red Seal.

51:59.720 --> 52:07.440
You know, it was really hyped up, it was supposed to be really awesome, and really was not awesome.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.000
It was controlled by poop.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.560
It was one of those things that sounded great on paper, huh?

52:11.560 --> 52:12.560
It did.

52:12.560 --> 52:13.560
Yes.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.000
And I don't know, it was just exciting.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.760
The whole concept of, you know, people call you on your phone in the game and you pick

52:19.760 --> 52:22.400
it up, you know, your remote like a phone.

52:22.400 --> 52:28.480
Apparently though, your phone has really shitty sound on it because, you know, those controllers.

52:28.480 --> 52:29.880
Very good.

52:29.880 --> 52:30.880
Drew?

52:30.880 --> 52:31.880
I have two.

52:31.880 --> 52:32.880
Okay.

52:32.880 --> 52:36.480
Guilty Gear Dust Strikers, the DS game.

52:36.480 --> 52:42.280
And the second almost everyone can agree with, the Matrix Path of Neo.

52:42.280 --> 52:44.680
It had such promise too.

52:44.680 --> 52:49.360
And then they went and screwed it up just like they did Enter the Matrix.

52:49.360 --> 52:50.360
Which one was the Matrix Path of Neo?

52:50.360 --> 52:51.360
I don't remember that one.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.360
I remember Enter the Matrix.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.360
It came out a couple years ago.

52:53.360 --> 52:57.080
It came out a couple years ago where you actually played as Neo, which is what all the Matrix

52:57.080 --> 52:59.920
fans wanted, you know, to play as Neo.

52:59.920 --> 53:05.520
But they screwed up the fighting system, they screwed up the plot, and they made a joke

53:05.520 --> 53:07.080
of a last boss.

53:07.080 --> 53:09.920
Easy, easy, easy for me.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.600
The game that was the biggest disappointment where I wanted to go back and smack the developers

53:12.600 --> 53:13.600
upside the head.

53:13.600 --> 53:15.040
And then 10 Dogs.

53:15.040 --> 53:16.040
Remember E3?

53:16.040 --> 53:17.200
I freaking fell in love with this game.

53:17.200 --> 53:19.400
I said it's going to be the greatest game that comes out this year and then when the

53:19.400 --> 53:21.760
game comes out I was bored with it in an hour.

53:21.760 --> 53:22.760
Woof.

53:22.760 --> 53:27.000
I know because there was nothing really else to do besides those three contests.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.760
There wasn't a lot of, like, competitive stuff and there wasn't much you could do with the

53:31.760 --> 53:32.760
dogs.

53:32.760 --> 53:36.280
Yes, I realized it was supposed to be a sim, but I don't know.

53:36.280 --> 53:39.520
I was thinking there would be more of a game to it and there wasn't and that was kind of

53:39.520 --> 53:40.520
sad.

53:40.520 --> 53:41.520
How about We Connect 24?

53:41.520 --> 53:43.720
Does that count as a game?

53:43.720 --> 53:44.720
Kind of.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.240
Animal Crossing DS would be a close second for me, honestly.

53:47.240 --> 53:52.040
Because I was expecting so much more from that and I think it felt more like a port

53:52.040 --> 53:55.360
than a sequel and that was what was ultimately disappointing.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.360
So there you have it.

53:56.360 --> 54:00.720
And the other disappointing thing about Nintendogs is the fact that it's been selling like crazy

54:00.720 --> 54:04.840
and now we have all of these knockoff games to thank, such as, like, Cats 2, which I think

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
we said earlier.

54:05.840 --> 54:07.640
Imagine Babies, all those stuff.

54:07.640 --> 54:16.280
Did you see they had, what was it, a bundle, I think, through, honestly, maybe, it was

54:16.280 --> 54:18.240
like one of the big retail chains.

54:18.240 --> 54:25.660
But it was the Nintendogs, like that metallic red or rose DS, and then two or three other

54:25.660 --> 54:26.660
versions of Nintendogs.

54:26.660 --> 54:29.640
You get, like, four of the same game.

54:29.640 --> 54:30.640
Nice.

54:30.640 --> 54:32.560
Very nice.

54:32.560 --> 54:36.120
Diemen Nourishment said it was designed to be played like 15 minutes a day, Rob.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.120
What do you want?

54:37.120 --> 54:38.120
Yeah!

54:38.120 --> 54:39.120
And then it got boring after two days.

54:39.120 --> 54:40.620
I mean, that was the problem.

54:40.620 --> 54:42.240
There was not a lot to come back for.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.720
There wasn't a lot to kind of, like, earn or work towards in that game.

54:44.720 --> 54:45.720
It's a frickin' Tamagotchi.

54:45.720 --> 54:46.720
Kinda.

54:46.720 --> 54:47.720
I don't know.

54:47.720 --> 54:50.680
It just, I was expecting so much more based on what I saw at E3.

54:50.680 --> 54:53.000
I was so excited and I was just so disappointed.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.800
Transformers The Game.

54:54.800 --> 54:55.800
Yeah.

54:55.800 --> 54:58.000
That would be one I was extremely disappointed in.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.720
All right, let's move on.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.800
Here's a story tip from our old buddy, RobWithTwoBees.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.960
Here is a link to a boy killing an old woman for money.

55:05.960 --> 55:09.480
He just happened to admit that it was to pay for an MMORPG time.

55:09.480 --> 55:13.480
I don't see how this is actually related to games, but that's how it is spun.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.380
If you ask me, the violent act was done solely for money.

55:16.380 --> 55:21.040
The fact that it was for four pounds sterling doesn't make it more tragic because the kid

55:21.040 --> 55:23.000
didn't know how much she had.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.920
So in other words, he's sending us a link to the story about how, you know, let's see,

55:27.920 --> 55:30.200
boy murders old woman for game money.

55:30.200 --> 55:32.440
Oh, and this is a story that was Doug and everything.

55:32.440 --> 55:37.520
It was a 13-year-old kid in Vietnam robbed an 81-year-old woman and he used the money

55:37.520 --> 55:39.200
to play online games.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.560
I see.

55:40.560 --> 55:43.880
And obviously where Rob's kinda going is that, isn't this really about a robbery?

55:43.880 --> 55:45.240
Why does it necessarily have to be about games?

55:45.240 --> 55:46.740
Who cares what they spin it on?

55:46.740 --> 55:48.480
It wasn't me, I swear.

55:48.480 --> 55:51.480
I mean, it's like, if he spin it on crack, it wouldn't have made the news.

55:51.480 --> 55:56.760
You know, it's sad that that woman got robbed, but we really want to know, what did he spend

55:56.760 --> 55:57.760
the money on?

55:57.760 --> 56:00.160
Let's get in the mind of this criminal.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.440
How did he spend that money?

56:01.440 --> 56:06.040
And then, let's prove that gamers are completely worthless moral rejects.

56:06.040 --> 56:11.760
I love this too, is that the story makes reference to the story from earlier this month when

56:11.760 --> 56:16.380
that kid beat up his mom over Halo 3 when she tried to take it away from him, like call

56:16.380 --> 56:20.200
the cops, that whole thing we read on a previous show.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.680
They remind folks of that.

56:21.680 --> 56:24.480
Yeah, let's just call it bad parenting and leave it at that.

56:24.480 --> 56:28.420
That's your Jamie angle, I imagine.

56:28.420 --> 56:31.560
Thank you, you do a very good job for filling in for Jamie when she's not here.

56:31.560 --> 56:32.560
I appreciate that.

56:32.560 --> 56:36.140
All right, we got one more email for you guys this week, and then if you want to contribute

56:36.140 --> 56:38.960
an email in the future, it's mailbag at orangelaunchrader.com.

56:38.960 --> 56:44.420
Our last email tonight comes from Rissimo, and Rissimo asks, hey guys, I love the show,

56:44.420 --> 56:46.280
and I always make sure to tell my friends about it.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.280
Thank you.

56:47.280 --> 56:49.440
I recall Loki saying that he had Ratchet and Clank.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.640
He hasn't said anything else about the game in a while.

56:51.640 --> 56:57.640
I love the game and was wondering if it's even been in his PS3 yet.

56:57.640 --> 57:02.160
My PS3 is being borrowed by a friend who likes Ratchet and Clank a lot more than I do.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.160
Nice.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.560
And he's playing it, and he loves the game.

57:05.560 --> 57:09.800
So that's a no, but to be honest, I don't even think I want to play the game.

57:09.800 --> 57:10.800
It looks fun.

57:10.800 --> 57:11.800
It looks like Ratchet and Clank.

57:11.800 --> 57:12.800
Then why'd you buy it?

57:12.800 --> 57:17.400
Because I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order, and I just said fuck it, I'm going to pick

57:17.400 --> 57:19.400
it up because it's supposed to be a good game.

57:19.400 --> 57:20.960
New tool.

57:20.960 --> 57:21.960
It looks good.

57:21.960 --> 57:26.800
It looks fun, but you know, it's just, I didn't play any of the Ratchet and Clank games, and

57:26.800 --> 57:30.160
there's probably a reason for that, because I didn't want to play them, and why the fuck

57:30.160 --> 57:31.160
did I buy the new one?

57:31.160 --> 57:35.360
I know, because I'm desperate for good games for the PS3.

57:35.360 --> 57:36.920
And which you don't play.

57:36.920 --> 57:41.160
Well, now I'm loaned it to a friend right now because he's going to get his own PS3

57:41.160 --> 57:45.440
soon, and probably when he does that, I'm probably going to sell him the game, so.

57:45.440 --> 57:47.920
Rama says, damn, Loki, you're sad.

57:47.920 --> 57:52.120
And Artitsuya says, Loki, do you think Mario Galaxy ripped them off as they claim?

57:52.120 --> 57:53.120
No.

57:53.120 --> 57:54.120
Alright.

57:54.120 --> 57:56.040
More of the email from Marisimo here.

57:56.040 --> 58:01.120
Also if you guys tried Super Stardust HD or any other PSN titles, I think that even though

58:01.120 --> 58:04.680
the selection is pretty slim, most of the games are worth trying, especially if you've

58:04.680 --> 58:06.360
got a Japanese account.

58:06.360 --> 58:09.080
GTProlog looks fucking amazing.

58:09.080 --> 58:12.680
Thanks for consistently putting on such great shows, we appreciate it.

58:12.680 --> 58:13.680
Thank you.

58:13.680 --> 58:17.880
I do have a Japanese account, and I do play GTProlog, and I still don't like Gran Turismo,

58:17.880 --> 58:22.320
no matter how pretty they make it, but that's just my personal preference.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.320
It looks pretty.

58:23.320 --> 58:28.540
I wouldn't say it's any better than Project Anthem Racing 3.

58:28.540 --> 58:33.200
I don't know, it's just, it's, when the, get the cars looking that good, it really, at

58:33.200 --> 58:37.280
this point, it's not like leaps and bounds better than anything that's out there right

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
now.

58:38.280 --> 58:39.440
So, you know, whatever.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.000
I do have Flow.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Flow's fun.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.840
I, personally, the only thing that's really stopping me from buying games on the Playstation

58:45.840 --> 58:50.640
Network is I hate their fucking account system, where you have to put money on this account

58:50.640 --> 58:55.080
or whatever, and then you download games with that, and you end up with this like five cent

58:55.080 --> 59:00.080
remainders and shit on there, because everything's like, you know, this 99 or whatever, instead

59:00.080 --> 59:04.040
of rounding them out, it's like, you know, Xbox Live Marketplace.

59:04.040 --> 59:09.280
So I just, even with Xbox Live Marketplace, so you get a little bit of that, where like

59:09.280 --> 59:11.320
you always have some points left over, you know?

59:11.320 --> 59:15.160
Yeah, but at least there's stuff I can download on there, I mean, and also a lot of the download

59:15.160 --> 59:22.160
stuff that they have on the Playstation Network is a little bit more expensive, or like less

59:22.160 --> 59:23.840
production value or whatever.

59:23.840 --> 59:29.240
I know there's good stuff on there, like Everyday Shooter and some of the stuff like that, but

59:29.240 --> 59:31.680
there's nothing really that's jumped out at me, other than Flow.

59:31.680 --> 59:33.840
Flow's kind of fun, but I don't know.

59:33.840 --> 59:34.840
Alright.

59:34.840 --> 59:39.160
Alright, well that's it for the mailbag, so again, if you want to email us sometime, mailbag

59:39.160 --> 59:40.560
at orangelaungeradio.com.

59:40.560 --> 59:47.200
Alright, anyways, on to some other stuff.

59:47.200 --> 59:51.760
Of course, it's no surprise that Super Mario Galaxy is selling well.

59:51.760 --> 01:00:01.360
It has sold 500,000 copies in the US in the first week alone, which is pretty awesome,

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.000
and of course it's probably going to be continuing to sell well all throughout the holidays.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.320
We also know that it sold 250,000 units in Japan in its first week as well, so definitely

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.120
one of the more popular games for the Wii out there, but I think it's no surprise that

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.560
it's selling that well.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.040
Although not millions and millions of copies, though, kind of like Halo 3.

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.360
Yeah, but wait for the Christmas season to be over.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.360
True.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.880
And this is also a game that people are going to constantly buy going forward.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:32.640
Halo 3, I don't know, it just kind of teetered off, like really quick, I think.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.040
Well, I mean, it had a huge launch, and everybody that had Halo 2, it's kind of like earlier

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.240
in the show, it's like about the whole MMO thing.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.520
In a way, it's kind of similar with hardcore fans of a series.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.360
Everybody's going to be out there day one buying it.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.120
Can you imagine if Halo 3's multiplayer servers have gone down going, oh, sorry, we didn't

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.680
think so many people would try to get on, which is basically what Squeenix did with

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680
Final Fantasy.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.560
Well, the difference is there's a single player element to Halo.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.960
I guess that's true.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.920
All right, well, anyhow, you can play single player in Final Fantasy XI.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.640
That's fine.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.120
There's a new device out there called the Cyber Familator.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.680
It allows you to play your Famicom games on your DS Lite.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.400
Also with this device, you can use a TV Out.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.760
Now, keep in mind that is a Famicom emulator, and it's not actually an emulator, it's

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.760
an actual device.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.560
You put your DS on top of it, and it does this whole thing, so keep in mind it's

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.440
not, it's Japanese, so you can't use it for NES games.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.680
But just out of curiosity, is this something you guys would want?

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.320
Would you want it like it is now to play Japanese imports, or do you think it might be kind

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.080
of cool to have something to use your old school NES cartridges on?

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.320
It looks kind of cool.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.880
Looks like almost the DS version of the Super 8.

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.640
I'd get it just for nostalgia's sake.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.840
I wish there was more you could do with it, kind of like with the Super Game Boy and stuff,

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.680
like you could change the colors and all that dumb shit.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:02:00.480
It would be cool if you could like, I don't know, hack the NES games and change the sprites

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.760
like you can on the PC.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:06.000
Honestly, if I were just going to buy something like that extra from my DS, I'd just buy

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.760
one of those cards to load ROMs on there and just play it off that.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.500
It would probably be a lot cheaper anyways.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.240
This person who I believe is DMN under one of his many nicknames will warn you though,

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.880
it will fuck your warranty, FYI.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.440
That's a good point, if you're going to get something like this and install a game

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.440
that still has warranties.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.640
Why would it fuck your warranty?

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.800
I think it's something you have to attach there.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.620
No, it just plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.200
That's why it's only on one screen, because it's plugging into the Game Boy Advance slot.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:35.000
You probably can fucking use it on a Game Boy Advance.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
But you know.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.560
Oh, it's for the DS, I'm sorry.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:38.560
Interesting.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:44.600
But yeah, it's not like something you have to mod your system for, that'd be stupid.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.680
Anyways, let's see here.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:51.280
There's actually been a series that just started on TV, and I've got to mention this.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.760
The Discovery Channel's Rise of the Video Game, it's actually pretty good.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:59.320
I watched the first episode of it, it reminds me if you've ever watched G4's Icon series

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.560
that they have.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.400
Very similar to that kind of thing, but it's kind of the whole history of video games,

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:11.880
and they just started with the very first computer game to the 70s, like Pac-Man, and

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.880
stuff like that.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.520
Yeah, exactly, and a really fascinating series, I mean, they're going to replay the hell out

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:23.360
of this all throughout the week, so I recommend catching it on TV, or YouTube.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.280
DMN would like to remind you that any third party thingamajig.license fucks your warranty,

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.280
apparently.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.280
Oh.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.280
Oh.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.120
You mean I avoided my warranty by using the Game Genie on my NES?

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.840
How would they prove that you fucked it up by plugging it in there?

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.400
If there's no physical evidence, they're not going to be like, hmm, I sense residue from

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
this thing.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.480
I mean, they're not fucking CSI.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.480
There's a lot of dust on this.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.760
My DS broke, you know, fix it, and they're just going to do it.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.000
They're not going to be able to tell unless you actually broke it open.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
You'll never know.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I'm not CSI.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
They don't have the snappy one-liners.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.080
All right.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.080
Let's go.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.080
Wait, I actually want to ask real quick about the rise of the video game.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.320
Is that something you actually watched?

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320
Yeah, I did.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.320
It was good.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.200
What was the format of it?

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.880
Because I forgot to TiVo it.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.280
It's basically a reminder, like I said, of the Icon series.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.720
They kind of discussed different things that went on, and then they would have developers

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.240
and major key figures and stuff commenting on it.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.640
They had the president of IGN.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.560
They had some of the first, the creator of Pac-Man and stuff, and they were talking about

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.480
just all the phenomenon, the pop culture stuff related with video games, and just the mentality

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.480
and all that stuff.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.720
They went and talked about Tetris.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.340
It just is very well done.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.200
It's a really cool series.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.480
I think it's worth checking out.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.720
The last documentary I watched on games was that PBS one that was in high def.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.720
It was kind of neat.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.760
I mean, this, like I said, I love the Icon series.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:05.120
That was probably my favorite show on G4, but now they do it about everything.

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.920
It's no longer good.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.800
Well, speaking of paying tribute to the elders, this is the part of the show, because we are

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.040
getting towards the end of the show.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.120
We are going to get into the Skype line soon, but first we want to cover this week's classic

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.120
game of the week.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:23.840
Now, Dark Soccer is not here this week, so I've taken it upon myself to select a classic

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.040
game of the week.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.760
I believe Loki will do one for next week.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.760
Okay.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.760
You better.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:29.760
All right.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760
Here is this week's classic game of the week.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.760
Oops, wrong music.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:46.360
All right, this week's classic game of the week is a game called Equinox is the classic

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.360
game of the week.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:54.320
Equinox was actually the sequel to another game on the NES called Solstice 2.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.120
Solstice was the game on NES.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:59.520
This was kind of Solstice 2 in many ways.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:05.000
Part of the reason I totally dig this game is the fact that it was kind of like...

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.520
I love the ambiance and the music in this game.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.280
It really set the mood.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.960
Basically, you have this kind of isometric view of the game.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.920
If you ever played Solstice on the NES, it was kind of very similar.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:23.200
You had this isometric view of the game, and you were going through these dungeons and

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.680
kind of trying to solve all these different puzzles in the game.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.820
The ambiance that the music set was just awesome.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.700
You got these different items, and you had to fight the bosses, and they had really cool

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.760
boss music in the game.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:41.480
I think, ironically, one of the things that was really cool about Equinox was that it

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.120
was actually developed by Sony.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.800
One of the Sony spin-offs companies, Sony ImagineSoft, was actually the company that

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.800
made this game.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.560
It was kind of like Sony making a game for the Super Nintendo, which is kind of cool.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.280
Of course, obviously, Sony ImagineSoft was phased out a little while later, and they

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.720
went on to make games for the PlayStation.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.200
If you enjoyed Solstice on the NES, you may not even know this game existed, so it's my

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.960
pick for the game of the week is Equinox.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.640
Did you guys ever play this game?

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640
Lowkey?

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640
Nope.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640
Yeah.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.040
It required a hell of a lot of patience.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.120
It had kind of a steep learning curve, but it was a little fun once you got used to it.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.120
It did.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.240
It had a real steep learning curve to it, and it was fucking hard.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.520
The other thing about it is that it had a really precise way to kind of get through

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.960
the game, and it was not very forgiving in regards to running into people and stuff.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:33.040
I don't know if it's maybe the YouTube guy playing it on an emulator or something, but

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.960
why the fuck is all the text in front of...

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960
Because it's a demo.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.960
You're looking at a demo.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:37.960
Oh.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:38.960
So.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.840
You pop up on the overworld, and within two minutes you're dead.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840
Yeah, it's tough.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.840
It's tough.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840
Yeah, there were little bosses around the overworld.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.160
You know this game was actually originally developed to be an RPG.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:52.920
If you actually look on YouTube, you can find YouTube clips of this game as an RPG.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.960
You can actually see text that was cut from the game.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.320
So kind of interesting the way it's set up.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.200
So there you have it.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:05.840
Being asked in chat room, DMN under the guise, your mom, says, Rob, will this be on virtual

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.840
console?

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.200
And I say, Lordy, I hope so.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.360
I hope so.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.400
So Loki, you'll be bringing a classic game next week in Jamie's Absence, correct?

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.400
Yeah.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.400
All right.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.400
All right.

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.400
This is the part of the show then.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.400
It is a short show tonight.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.120
We want to cram it all into one segment, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120
lines.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:29.180
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.720
And folks have been hammering the phones already.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.440
I believe we already have a call on the line.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.440
Call are you there?

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.440
Hi, Rob.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.440
Hi.

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.440
Is this Jamie?

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.440
Yes, it is.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.440
Hi, Jamie.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.440
How are you?

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.780
I'm looking at the rain right now.

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.400
Is it raining where you're at?

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.040
Oh, yeah, it's raining.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040
Of course.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040
So I'm sure...

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040
I am...

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.040
I'm sorry.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040
I know you're...

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040
I'm...

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
Oh, go ahead.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.040
I'm just saying I'm calling from Alabama.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.040
Well, how has things been going out there?

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040
How was your Thanksgiving?

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.560
We had it yesterday, and the mom cooked for a small army, but thankfully a small army

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.960
showed up, and then they went off to kick butt for me.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960
Nice.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.240
And it was pretty cool.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.400
And we've just been doing a lot of hanging out.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.760
I haven't gotten much played, but I did watch a movie that a lot of people on the Half-Life

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.000
and Portal boards were saying that they thought Portal might have been based off of.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.160
I had mentioned to you earlier it was Cube.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.040
Oh, the movie Cube.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.360
Yeah, that movie's cool.

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.360
I love that movie.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.360
I saw it a long time ago.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.440
But there are some real bastardized sequels to the movie, from what I understand.

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:37.200
I haven't seen them, so I guess I should withhold my final opinion until I see them, but I've

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.360
heard the sequels are not good.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:39.960
Hypercube is a mindfuck.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.480
Hypercube and Cube Zero.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.480
Yes.

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.480
I'm supposed to be watching while I'm here.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.480
Oh, nice.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480
Very nice.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480
Have you gotten any gaming done while you've been out there?

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.480
Not really.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:49.880
I haven't had much of a chance to.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:55.840
I did bring my Game Boy with me, and actually on the plane, I tried to play Olendan, because

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:56.840
I've got puppies.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:57.840
Copy.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.840
Nice.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840
Olendan's a fun game play.

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.840
Not much else.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:06.560
I almost logged into Ragnarok once at this Wi-Fi place that we found.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.560
Very cool.

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.560
It was pending.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.560
No, it didn't.

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.560
I resisted the urge.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.920
If I sounded a little distracted during the Classic Game of the Week segment, that's because

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.920
I was actually trying to pick up Jamie's call, but I was curious, did you hear the Classic

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.920
Game of the Week segment?

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.480
Did I pick a worthy game this week?

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.520
Did you say you picked Psychonauts?

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:28.400
No, it was Equinox, which was Solstice II on the Super Nintendo, basically.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.960
I was like, that wasn't on Super Nintendo.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.360
No, no, Equinox.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360
No.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360
How?

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.760
Equinox, which was much, well, I like Psychonauts, too.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.440
I can't say it's much cooler, but it was a very cool game.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.760
I was just curious if I picked a worthy game this week.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.160
I'd say you did.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.440
That's a pretty good one.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.440
Awesome.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.440
The other thing-

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.440
Get my Samsung approval.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440
Good.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.440
Good.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.440
I'm always looking for that.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:01.420
Loki, tell Jamie a little bit about the story we covered earlier in the evening.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:05.600
There's apparently a girl Grand Theft Auto type of game coming out, and Loki, what is

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.080
it you can do in this game?

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:08.960
You can do drugs.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:16.040
You can also have sex with people for your own personal gain, spread rumors, stuff like

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:17.040
that.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.200
Does this sound like the female Grand Theft Auto to you, doing drugs and pulling people's

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.200
hair?

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.200
No.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:28.040
See, my perfect version would be this hardcore chick with an- we actually described him watching

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.040
Planet Terrace.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.040
It would be worth a gallon.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.360
And it's developed by a company called Champagne for the Ladies.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.740
That's so stupid.

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.740
What about-

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.740
Okay.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.960
Wait, who would be cooler, Rose McGowan or Tank Girl?

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.320
Ooh, that's a hard one.

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.800
That's a hard, hard one.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.120
I don't know, Tank Girl's pretty hardcore, but she'd have to have the tanks.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120
That's true.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:56.080
I think they should just make a Tank Girl video game, honestly.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080
That would be great.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.080
Yeah, we were going to when it got canceled.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.080
Doh.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.080
Of course, she would have to do all the art work.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.080
Yeah, I'm an original PlayStation.

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.080
All right.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.760
Well, Ms. Dark Sakura, sorry you couldn't be here tonight, but you're going to miss

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:12.280
the great Wee Zapper Challenge, which is taking place after the show.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.240
But we'll look forward to your return in a couple weeks.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.520
Is there anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.520
I've already been challenged by Wee Zapper.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:21.360
I fell on my foot before I left.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.120
Well, congratulations on that.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.380
I'm actually watching Eddie Izzard right now.

01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.040
I hope the same doesn't happen to me.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.440
Well, then go enjoy the Eddie Izzard.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.440
All right.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.440
All right.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.440
Take care.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440
Bye, everybody.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.440
Bye.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440
We'll be back in two weeks.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.440
Bye-bye.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:39.520
Jamie was very patient waiting on hold while I was doing the Classic Game of the Week,

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.520
so I appreciate that.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.520
All right.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.520
Let's go to the phones again.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.040
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you can call, or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:48.360
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.520
Who's this?

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.520
It's Ravenstaufen.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520
Hello, Ravenstaufen.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.880
How are you?

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.880
I am okay.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.440
A little cramped in here.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.440
Little cramped?

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.440
Yeah.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.560
My house is being renovated.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.320
It's worked on, so I'm in a cramped little room right now.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.640
Oh, I thought maybe you had the whole Thanksgiving family thing going on.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.720
No, it was quiet, but enough about that.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:14.440
My show can't stop talking about the damn Orange Box since it damn came out pissing

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.440
me off.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.440
Why is that?

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.440
Well, damn.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.440
What's so damn great about it?

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:21.240
Because I haven't been playing it.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.320
That's all they've been talking about.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.080
Don't you have control over it?

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.520
Can't you just say, hey, no more Orange Box?

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.560
I tried, and then they go like, no.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.560
We got to play Portal.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.560
Portal is awesome.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.560
Ravenstaufen.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.560
And then Game Portraits is awesome.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.760
And then I'm like, you haven't played it very much.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.400
It's like, yeah, it's very hardcore.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.680
Yeah, it's very hardcore.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.520
Offer them a cake if they shut up.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.280
Wait, now, so did you just call in tonight to bitch about your own show's politics, or

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280
what's the deal?

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.280
Oh, no.

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.280
Not at all.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.280
All right.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280
What else is up?

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.080
You talked about Portal and all those games.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080
I guess it's your...

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.560
I haven't really played them still yet.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.600
I'm like the least coolest kid on the block.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.600
So you're just like me.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.600
OK.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.600
Now you're in the same boat.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.040
Well, except Loki, one of the cool kids on the block is loaning me his copy.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.560
So maybe by next week, I'll be sitting here giggling, going, hee hee, the cake is a lie.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.480
You know, and all that stuff that everybody else is doing.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.320
So we'll see.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.040
Do you think, does this kind of stuff kind of irritate you when people go too far?

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.040
It does.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040
It pisses me off.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.040
Really?

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.040
I'm sorry.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.840
It pisses me off, especially when a commercial that goes, the greatest game of all time.

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.400
And with the PlayStation 3 version being very unplayable, Gabe Newell must really hate that

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.400
thing.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:38.440
Apparently, there's not a lot of nice things to say about it from Valve.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.440
I love it.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.160
Technically, it's like, I hate the PlayStation 3.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.400
I'm just going to gimp it.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.400
Apparently, a lot of folks are doing that.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400
All right.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.880
Well, any final thoughts for our listeners, Ravensdolphin?

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.680
No, but don't be in a cramped room.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.680
All right.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.400
We'll try to avoid that, even though the studio is a little cramped.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.400
All right.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.400
Take care.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.400
Bye.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:05.240
1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call, or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.280
How are you enjoying Jamie's chair tonight, Loki?

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.400
I never asked.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.720
The big fluffy blue chair.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.720
It's warm.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720
I don't know.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.760
But then again, that might be my cold.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.760
All right.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.000
Let's go over to the phones, take some more calls.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Who's this?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Yo, this is Preston.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
How you doing?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Hey, how you doing?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Better known as Xenocore.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Yep.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000
What's up, Xenocore?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.800
Same old stuff, different day, man.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.800
Gotcha.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800
What's your gaming week been like?

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.600
Actually, first off, did you have a good Thanksgiving?

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.240
Yeah, I got turkey for days, dude.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.240
Awesome.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.240
Leftovers.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240
Turkey and then turkey everything for a whole week.

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:42.760
Got turkey and nothing but turkey and sleeping for the next half week or so.

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.760
Gotcha.

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:44.760
So how was your gaming week?

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:45.760
What do we owe the call to tonight?

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.760
Well, I've been getting all of my November 20th gaming out of the way.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.400
So finally managed to finish Assassin's Creed and saw the little cliffhanger ending they

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.400
gave us there.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.960
That was kind of upsetting.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.960
Interesting.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.920
So did they set it up totally for a sequel, as many games do these days?

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.200
Well, yeah, but there was no end of the chapter, so to speak.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.720
You just fall right off the cliff.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:10.600
It's pitch black and you just walk right off the cliff.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.600
OMG spoilers.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.600
Next one.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.000
Can we not spoil this?

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.600
No, it doesn't sound major.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.880
What they did do is interesting.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.160
You're definitely drawn to the story, so you still want to find out what's going on, but

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.040
you just hit that wall flat out.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.280
There's no gentle slope to say, okay, now wait for the next one.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:32.080
It's like, oh shit, now I got to go buy number two to figure out what's going on, but it's

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.120
kind of interesting what they did.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.120
Interesting.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.440
And Assassin's Creed apparently, since it's a brand new IP, right, and it's doing very

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.400
well for being a brand new IP, so it sounds like they already know there's going to be

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.400
an Assassin's Creed at some point.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.720
Yeah, they're talking about the sequel.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:45.720
Oh, wow.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.720
Very cool.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.720
Anything else you've been playing as Unicorn?

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:51.360
Yeah, I've been getting Mass Effect out the way.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
How is that?

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
Let's check that out.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.520
I'm very, very curious about Mass Effect.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:01.120
Well, Loki, did you play the beta version or the demo version they had at the trade

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.840
shows, or did you actually play a full version of it?

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.720
No, I played a full version of it.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.800
All right, because after the review I heard last week, I'm not sure if you were playing

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:12.360
the same game I am, because there wasn't that much talking before I started shooting anyway.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.280
No, there's quite a bit of talking.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.640
I disagree, but anyway, I'm used to Bioware stuff, so I guess I sort of gloss over it.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.600
See, I didn't play anything from Bioware.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.600
I didn't play Jade Empire or anything like that, so maybe this...

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.600
I could have been nitpicking.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:32.320
I only had 30 minutes in my lunch, and I just want to kill you while there you go, and hey,

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.520
25 minutes of that lunch is spent talking.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.160
Loki, you missed alien sex.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.160
I didn't miss it.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.800
There's no fucking alien sex in there.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.760
It's implied sex.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.360
That's bullshit.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.680
Loki says fucking lifetime TV implied sex is what that is.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.760
Penetration or it didn't happen.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.960
Well, I can't confirm or deny that right now, because apparently, based off how far I've

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.840
gotten into the game, the scene they show isn't from a party member.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:06.920
It's from an NPC, so if there is some party member fornicating, we haven't seen what it

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:07.920
looks like yet.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.560
The plot thing is, apparently my friends...

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.260
See, the reason why I haven't bought Mass Effect is that there's just too many games

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:18.120
and not enough money in the wallet, however, one of my friends who got Mass Effect is already

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:21.360
halfway through the game and said he'll let me borrow it as soon as he finishes it, so

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.800
I'm hoping I can take a look at it for a future show.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.080
I'll eventually get around to playing it.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:29.000
I mean, it's just right now there's, like you said, too many things to play.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.120
I'm trying to get rid of some of this, like, I looked at Crackdown, oh yeah, my copy of

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.440
Crackdown stopped working for some reason.

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.720
I fucking love Crackdown.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.120
It refuses to work now.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.480
What do you think about, I know you play a lot of RPGs, Xenocore, what do you think about

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.720
the conversation style in Mass Effect?

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.720
Is it really cool?

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.800
Is it something you'd like to see in more games?

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.960
Well, it's not anything different from what they've done previously.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.840
It's still the same BioWare chat interface, they just put more visual cues and stuff in

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.700
it, so there's more interaction with the characters since everybody speaks, and there's more facial

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.440
animation so you can see emotion, but other than that, it's the same BioWare engine they've

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.440
always been using.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.440
Nice.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:08.440
All right.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.880
Well, again, I'm like Loki, I didn't play the previous games, so Star Trek Amy.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880
You know what, guys?

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.240
I think I need to introduce you to Knights of the Old Republic, to Neverwinter Knights,

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:21.440
to Jade Empire, all these BioWare games that you haven't played.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.440
None of those games I've played.

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.440
You need to.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.280
And I gotta say, I realize there's a lot of folks listening to this show who think we're

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:32.520
experts on everything, but we're gamers just like you guys and we don't have time for everything,

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.560
but I definitely want to at least look at everything if I have a chance.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:38.720
That's why I miss E3, because at E3 you can at least look at everything and kind of go,

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.960
yeah, I'm more interested in this or I'm not so interested in this, so yeah.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.960
All right.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:46.760
Well, Xenocore, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:51.320
Yeah, just one other point on Mass Effect, the rover kicks ass.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.760
I mean, the Warthog is shit now.

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:58.840
The Land Rover you get to use in Mass Effect is the new ride I want, man.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.840
Interesting.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.000
There's so much detail put into the way that vehicle just operates.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.240
I can just drive it all day on the planets and stuff, it's great.

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:07.240
Very cool.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.320
I mean, it's kind of interesting hearing about a lot of big games of the year getting compared

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.040
to Halo 3 where it looks like Halo 3 may not be the game of the year.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.740
There's all these other games that are doing these other little things, whereas a lot of

01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.640
folks kind of thought Halo 3 may take the ground.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.040
It may not, but we'll see.

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.880
Yeah, it's because it's Halo 2.5 and not Halo 3.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.120
That may be it right there.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.120
All right.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.200
Well, Xenocore, we got to let you go so we can get a couple more calls in before we go,

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.200
but thank you so much for calling, okay?

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.200
No problem.

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.200
Take it easy, guys.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.200
All right.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.200
Take care, buddy.

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:41.720
If you want to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.320
Don't be deterred if you go straight to voicemail.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.000
If you're going straight to voicemail, it's just because we're on another call, so don't

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.720
cry if you get voicemail.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.880
Meanwhile, some last-minute stories real quick if we have any.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.560
Omega 5 is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.560
Oh.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.120
Looking for a kick-ass shooter.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:01.920
Wait, that's not the same thing as the Omega Warhawk expansion.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920
No.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.920
Omega 5.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:04.920
Oh.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.320
It's a Hudson shooter.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.320
Interesting.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.320
All right.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.320
Hello.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.320
You're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.320
Who's this?

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:12.320
What's up?

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:13.320
This is Dillinger.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.320
Hi, Dillinger.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:18.320
I'm usually 3ama, but I kind of felt like a name change.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.320
All right.

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.320
Well, hey.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.320
You know what?

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:22.320
When it's your nickname, you have the right to do that.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.520
You're a little bit quiet, so make sure you get a little closer to your mic and tell us

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.520
what's on your mind.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.520
All right.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.880
I wanted to talk a bit about Mario Galaxy.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:37.960
I've basically been playing it over the entire Thanksgiving break, and I've got to say that

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.200
if you've got a Wii, you have to buy this game.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:46.840
It is kind of childish, and it's a bit easy at the beginning, but once you really get

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.000
into the game, especially the later stuff, you only have to have... It's another one

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.920
of the... There's 120 stars that you can get, and you only have to have 60 to go to

01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:03.480
the final boss, but the final 60 is just... It is better than everything else in the game.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.360
It is better than a lot of the stuff in Mario 64, in my opinion.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.200
There's some really innovative stuff in there.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:16.180
I think that Mario Galaxy is basically the definite game to get for the Wii.

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.760
You know, it's kind of interesting because I can hear the excitement in your voice when

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.240
you're talking about games, and when you hear that excitement, it makes other people excited,

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:29.520
so certainly I liked the bits of Mario Galaxy that I have played so far.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.400
I haven't bought the full game yet, but I'm kind of curious.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.560
What did you think about the motion in that game, meaning like, you know how it was more

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.120
of a round environment?

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:42.280
I kind of thought it was a game where I'd be able to get disoriented very easily, even

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.000
more so than most 3D games.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Do you find that?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.920
Was it kind of hard to kind of figure out where you were at in the game, or was it something

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.440
you just kind of pick up as you go?

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.440
Not really.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:55.040
I found that you get used to it after a bit.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.440
I mean, I've had a couple of friends over that have played it, my brothers played it,

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.680
and it's a little weird in the beginning, obviously, because you're getting used to

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:09.600
this whole new orientation, but after a little bit, you really get used to it.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:10.600
Have you tried any of the co-op mode?

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.320
Because I know you said you had your friends over, and I noticed in a commercial I saw

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.340
the other day, they were really hyped in the co-op mode.

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.800
How is it?

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.560
Co-op isn't really anything great.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.360
All that you can do is you can move your wiimote around and you can collect the stars for them,

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.440
or you can stun the enemies, or actually you can make them jump, so it's great, because

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.520
you can really mess around with your friends.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.440
They'll be trying to jump somewhere, and you can tell them to jump earlier.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.740
It's pretty stupid, but it's good for a lot.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:40.880
Very cool.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.960
Anything else on the Wii that you're looking forward to this holiday season, besides Super

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:44.960
World?

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.960
Trauma Center.

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:46.960
I'm a huge Trauma Center guy.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.200
I loved Second Opinion.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.520
I never played the DS one.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:56.320
I sold my DS before it came out, but I'm really looking forward to New Blood.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.160
I know it's already out, but I also really want to get Geometry Wars.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.040
I played it once at my friend's house on Xbox, the 360 off of the live arcade or whatever

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:09.600
the hell it's called, and it was tons of fun.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:14.220
I'm a really huge Gretsch guy, so I'm looking forward to that.

01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:17.880
We interviewed the developers a couple weeks ago on the show, and it's going to be interesting,

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.800
because they are changing the way it works for the Wii, incorporating the motion control,

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.680
so I'm kind of excited to see how that works.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:25.680
Oh, god.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.240
Was that episode 251?

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.080
I don't remember which episode it was.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.080
About three weeks ago.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.080
Try 254, 253.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.080
I think it was in there somewhere.

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.280
It's probably still on iTunes.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:39.120
I vaguely remember you guys doing an interview in Part B of 251.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.440
I don't remember if it was that or what, but yeah, it's somewhere in there, so check it

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.440
out.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:44.440
What was the other thing I wanted to say?

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.320
Trauma Center is a game I like as well, and that reminds me, that's something I want to

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:52.120
look at, too, is the new Trauma Center game, because it's not just a DS port, like it was

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.120
actually made for the Wii.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.120
Yeah, I heard it got good reviews.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.120
Oh, I'm excited.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.120
I got to check that out.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.640
Above average reviews.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.320
That was a great game for the Wii.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.120
I will never forget, because I didn't really play the DS one either.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.240
I kind of skipped it when it came on DS, but I played it on Wii.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:07.440
I will never forget the first time you have to use the defibrillators, and you're like

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.720
clear, and you have to actually push towards the screen.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.720
It's great.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720
I love Trauma Center.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.720
I need to check that out, too.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.720
All right.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.720
Well, Dillinger, thanks so much for the call.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:20.360
We've got to take a couple more calls, but any quick final thoughts for our listeners?

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360
Quick final thoughts.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:25.280
Dragon Force is the greatest band ever.

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:29.680
I mean, I freaked out when I heard that they were going to be in Guitar Hero 3, even though

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.200
I can't be through the fire and the plans aren't expert.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.200
Rock on.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.200
I agree.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.200
Dragon Force is amazing.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.360
I still want them on the show.

01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.360
We'll see.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.760
Maybe that'll be my Christmas present.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.760
We'll see.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.760
That'd be great.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.760
All right.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.760
We'll see you later.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:43.760
It was nice to have you on the program.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.760
You, too.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:48.920
And have fun with Mario Galaxy, and good luck in getting all those 120 what-have-you stars

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.320
that are in that game.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.740
It's nuts.

01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:55.480
Any other last-minute stories you got for us, Logie?

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.480
There's one I forgot.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:02.240
I didn't make show roll for some reason, but Night's Journey into Dreams is coming to the

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:06.760
PlayStation 2, the original Night's that was on the Saturn.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.760
Nice.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.360
You know, I think probably it didn't make the show roll because we had a short show

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.360
tonight, but I'm glad.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.120
Well, I didn't put it on there, so.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.120
Oh, well, then.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.120
I forgot.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.120
All right.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.760
No, I do remember reading that, though, so very cool.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.440
Let's go to one more call for tonight.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.440
Who's this?

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.320
Aww, caller, are you there?

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.720
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.920
If you're there, say hello.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:38.760
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.760
Caller's not there.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.120
Folks, you want to use Echo 1-2-3 to test your connection before you give us a call,

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.160
or you could just use a regular telephone as well.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.160
That always works.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:54.800
Always got to love when the last call tonight is something that fails.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.800
Anyhow, let's go ahead and wrap up.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.920
On that note, let's wrap up the show tonight.

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.880
So we're going to do our challenge on Op 11, yes?

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.280
We're going to do our crossbow challenge?

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280
Yes, you're welcome.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.280
Awesome.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.840
Let's go around and hear everybody's final thought.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:13.400
If there's no other last minute stories, let's go around and hear everybody's final

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:14.400
thought.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.400
Drew, thanks for filling in tonight.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.040
Sorry you got robbed of half a show, but come back.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.040
Oh, I will.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.040
I will.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:26.040
And you did get to peek at what we have coming in 2008 out in the, well, we don't call it

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.040
a garage.

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:28.040
We call it a new studio.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.040
What do you think?

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.040
It'll be interesting.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.040
I am impressed.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.920
I hope that it all goes well.

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:33.920
I hope so.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:34.920
We'll see.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.720
Did you change something since I last looked for it?

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.720
No.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.800
It's kind of funny stuff, but kind of just explaining the concepts and what we hope to

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:41.800
have up.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.800
So this would be very cool.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:45.240
It's kind of like, remember when you and I shared a place, we had a lot of cool stuff

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.240
there we haven't had since?

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.240
Yeah.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.240
Like a TV and stuff?

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:49.240
We had to destroy that.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.240
We're going to have it back.

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:51.240
Oh, poor thing.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.240
All right, your final thoughts.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.240
Drew, did I get your final thoughts?

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.240
No.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.240
Then what's your final thoughts, Drew?

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.640
I needs my wow.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.640
Addict.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.640
Loki.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:04.720
I feel hot and I hope I don't have a fever because that would suck.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:11.280
And my final thought is I want more pumpkin pie and then I don't like pumpkin coffee and

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.280
pumpkin everything.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.720
I want pumpkin everything.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.720
That's what I want.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.460
