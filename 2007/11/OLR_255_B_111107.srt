[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course...

12
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:10,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually pretty cool.

13
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:12,686
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a bunch of different things you can do in there.

14
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:17,067
[SPEAKER_04]: You can browse the top voted, I guess it's like hot or not for me's.

15
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,988
[SPEAKER_04]: You can browse the top voted me's in there.

16
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:25,170
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check out some random ones, download the ones you like, which is pretty cool.

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Post the ones you think are cool.

18
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people will rate them.

19
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:35,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they have themed contests like the one going on right now is design a me that looks like Mario without his hat.

20
00:01:35,868 --> 00:01:36,488
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:03,528
[SPEAKER_03]: is when the message came on the Wii that the channel was up.

22
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:10,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So Loki and I briefly looked for, like, five minutes of the new channel during the break, and some pretty interesting Miis in there.

23
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked there was, like, a Geordi LaForge Mii that was in there.

24
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody had created a little miniature picture of, like, a penguin on somebody's face.

25
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:18,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I thought that was really good.

26
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:22,438
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some pretty cool, you know, Mii's on there.

27
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:25,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I could post some of the ones I've made, though.

28
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you might get rejected.

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,960
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens if you send penis head in?

30
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,821
[SPEAKER_03]: That might get rejected.

31
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:32,516
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:02:59,332 --> 00:02:59,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

33
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:03,660
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, the Check Me Out channel is available right now.

34
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:08,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time most of you guys hear this, it will have been out for actually quite some time.

35
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:12,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Something moving on, speaking about the Wii.

36
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:20,994
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii has been rumored earlier this week, based on a comment from Reggie Fils-AimÃ©, to have 200 virtual console games by the year's end.

37
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:31,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were kind of freaking out, like, wait a minute, in order for the Wii to have that many games by the year's end, they're going to have to really step up their production, putting out like four and a half games a week, four to five games a week.

38
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,621
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 and a half games.

39
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of stuff to check out.

40
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:56,962
[SPEAKER_03]: The old school stuff.

41
00:03:57,262 --> 00:04:01,263
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I would like to point out we are, what, 160 games in so far?

42
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:03,744
[SPEAKER_03]: And still no Guardian Legend.

43
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:04,824
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes me a sad panda.

44
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,785
[SPEAKER_03]: That is sad.

45
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:06,465
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a crime.

46
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:07,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Awful.

47
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:07,785
[SPEAKER_03]: That has been committed.

48
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:12,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what rights you have to get, but you better get those really quick.

49
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:17,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all I have to say about the Virtual Console.

50
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for our friends in the UK, Super Mario Bros.

51
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,530
[SPEAKER_10]: 3 is heading to Virtual Console.

52
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:24,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, we are getting it on Monday.

53
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:26,530
[SPEAKER_03]: We got this Monday.

54
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we already got this Monday.

55
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to be 500 Wii Points.

56
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:37,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Also coming out is Blue's Journey for the Neo Geo, and that will be 900.

57
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:42,020
[SPEAKER_10]: And also Power Golf for TurboGrafx-16 for 600 points.

58
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad to see that Super Mario Bros.

59
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,613
[SPEAKER_03]: 3 is making the rounds worldwide, because it is a great game.

60
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:54,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It is one of the all-time great NES classics, so everybody gets to enjoy it now.

61
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:54,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

62
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:56,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

63
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:58,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

64
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So, apparently some Best Buys have been breaking street on Super Mario Galaxy and selling it early.

65
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:04,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on them.

66
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:13,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently a few people have been buying according to the Games Facts forum thread, I guess.

67
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,074
[SPEAKER_04]: They have pictures online including stuff

68
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, you only have to wait a couple more days to play it, so... Hurry.

69
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:25,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if they had Super Smash Bros., that'd be... That'd be a feat.

70
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:31,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow don't think they can get that right now.

71
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:34,403
[SPEAKER_03]: ACHP is in our chatroom and is bragging, I got a copy!

72
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:42,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently, somehow... Some folks were able to get one from Best Buy, so good job to those folks.

73
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Um...

74
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:56,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, speaking of Super Mario Galaxy, right now, right this very minute, there is an event going on at the Nintendo World Store in New York City.

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the Mario Galaxy Launch Party.

76
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:00,904
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going on right now.

77
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:05,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it started at 8 p.m.

78
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:10,032
[SPEAKER_03]: is when it started, but it's only been going until 10 p.m., so I guess it...

79
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:11,792
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

80
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Zaku, how are you doing?

81
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:12,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just here in the rock right here, just seeing Mario Galaxy on screens, and people just going after t-shirts, and just freaking my ass off.

82
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,401
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, that's pretty much it.

83
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:16,782
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell's going on?

84
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,983
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell have they been doing there tonight, Zaku?

85
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,584
[SPEAKER_03]: They've had a Velcro wall?

86
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:23,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Large party.

87
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:26,607
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a live DJ right now.

88
00:07:27,327 --> 00:07:28,507
[SPEAKER_07]: They're giving out free shit.

89
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:31,409
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people waiting in line for the launch.

90
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:39,035
[SPEAKER_07]: and I know one of them is the one that actually got the first Wii in this country last year before the rest of, you know, Times Square.

91
00:07:39,856 --> 00:07:40,616
[SPEAKER_07]: That same guy.

92
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:41,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

93
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:43,378
[SPEAKER_07]: That same guy with the puzzle on his right hand.

94
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,340
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some hard... He's up on the line like one of the first two.

95
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,322
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some hardcore people out there right now.

96
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:52,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can't hear them but it's fantastic.

97
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:53,764
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

98
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:56,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just gonna say it sounds like there's some hardcore people there.

99
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:57,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a few thousand people.

100
00:07:58,006 --> 00:07:59,167
Um, but there's like

101
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:04,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us more about the special events that are going on.

102
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you actually been able to get your hands on the game yet?

103
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:08,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I played it.

104
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:08,553
[SPEAKER_07]: They had these...

105
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:30,536
[SPEAKER_07]: And like three guys with monitors basically sticking out from like a rod or something that they're carrying on their back with the game.

106
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:33,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like how they did last year with the Segway.

107
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,300
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the Wii hooked up to the Segway, now they're basically walking.

108
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,962
[SPEAKER_07]: They're carrying all that gear, walking the game, you know, bringing the game to you by foot.

109
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:49,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, our chat room is just pretty excited to be hearing the actual live report from the show going on right now.

110
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:55,691
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, Frisbee in our chat room says, this is the first time I've heard Zaku call in and not sound sleepy.

111
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So you definitely are excited to be there, right?

112
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, come on.

113
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to bust my ass in the cold.

114
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:04,206
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

115
00:09:05,347 --> 00:09:11,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty much just going to get some coffee and take a leak just to get this call through.

116
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,172
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so far it's been good.

117
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:20,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the game pretty much plays like Mario 64, only with motion control and slightly better graphics.

118
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:22,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

119
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:26,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, can you give a shout-out to the entire crowd that Orange Lounge Radio says hello?

120
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:32,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on the outside of the crowd, it's pretty thick right there.

121
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be hard to get inside there.

122
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:39,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give a big shout out to everybody around you that Orange Hodge Radio says hello?

123
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:47,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh man, they'll be just looking at random strangers just saying some crazy stuff.

124
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:51,134
[SPEAKER_07]: If I knew about this earlier, then I would have just done my whole body with OLR promotion stuff.

125
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I just would have put the West Side Dames.

126
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,500
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all good.

127
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaku, thanks so much for the report and have fun at the event.

128
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't go too crazy, okay?

129
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, buddy.

130
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:21,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one.

131
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:21,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

132
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor guy.

133
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:28,967
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of our infamous callers, the Legend of Zaku, calling us live from the Mario launch event at the Nintendo...

134
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,103
[SPEAKER_03]: World Headquarters in New York City.

135
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that fun when we can do live reports like that?

136
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,767
[SPEAKER_03]: More stuff needs to happen on Sunday nights when we can do that.

137
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:38,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

138
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:42,131
[SPEAKER_03]: You can definitely hear in the background, just like there's tons of people there.

139
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:42,711
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

140
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's move on then with the news.

141
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Zaku, again for that special report.

142
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:56,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in other news, and I think that this is pretty cool because there are a lot of fans of this game.

143
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:58,142
[SPEAKER_10]: For a

144
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone with a PSP, Disgaea is heading out to PSP.

145
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:05,863
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be called Afternoon of Darkness.

146
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:07,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so it's like a new game in the series.

147
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:09,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds like.

148
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:21,989
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting in a few specific things for the PSP, like a multiplayer mode where you can go against your friends worldwide or share items from your shop.

149
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:25,130
[SPEAKER_10]: It has an exclusive story line.

150
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:30,583
[SPEAKER_10]: and you're trying to become the beauty queen ultimate overlord.

151
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:37,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not your goal in real life, DarkSakura, to become the beauty queen overlord?

152
00:11:38,187 --> 00:11:40,048
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my goal is just to be the overlord.

153
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:41,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

154
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:42,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

155
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people really love Disgaea for its quirky sense of humor, and I played it once.

156
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:47,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

157
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:51,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to sit down and spend more time with it if I could ever tear myself away from those damn MMOs.

158
00:11:52,355 --> 00:11:56,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you're in the U.S., you're in luck because it came out a couple weeks ago.

159
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:57,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet!

160
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely worth picking up if you like Disgaea.

161
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very typical that the Brits are getting it a couple weeks behind.

162
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

163
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:06,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we still love you.

164
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:11,965
[SPEAKER_04]: PSP is a region free, so if you really, really, really, really, really need your Disgaea right away, then there you go.

165
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:25,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, not a big surprise, but Sony has released a custom theme maker for the PlayStation 3, much like they did with the PSP after they had theme support for that.

166
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:31,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, with the new firmware 2.0 allowing themes, you can now create your own.

167
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:41,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, as soon as I get around to it, I will create new themes for the PSP website, and I'll also create a theme for the PlayStation 3 as well.

168
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:42,594
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about time.

169
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:43,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Sheesh.

170
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:44,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whatever.

171
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too busy playing stuff.

172
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:56,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I just renewed the domain not that long ago, and I seriously considered just letting it expire, but then I remember that there were some people that were emailing us saying, I listen to you on the PSP, and so I figured, alright, for them we'll keep the site up.

173
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really well done website.

174
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:01,183
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see many PSP custom done websites.

175
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:05,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not renew the domain for OLRE since I never made a site for that.

176
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:05,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn you.

177
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:06,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

178
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:07,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

179
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:08,808
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgive you.

180
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:24,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, also on the PlayStation 3, apparently, if you had your firmware before version 2.0, you usually only used to be able to see videos if it was supported in PlayStation 3's format.

181
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:35,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now after the 2.0 patch, apparently, the PlayStation 3 will now show you thumbnails, running times, and file names for other non-supported formats, such as Xvid and DivX.

182
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you can't play them, you can just see them.

183
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:48,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly people are taking that one step further and saying, well, this is a sign that you're actually going to have support for DivX and Xvid in the near future on the PlayStation 3, which would certainly be a welcome addition.

184
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

185
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,638
[SPEAKER_03]: But for right now, you only get thumbnails and you get to know they're there.

186
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:56,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that it will say, you can't watch me, na-na-na-na-na-na.

187
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:58,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it.

188
00:13:58,283 --> 00:13:59,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, poor baby.

189
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:04,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so, it's about, you know, we've

190
00:14:05,326 --> 00:14:15,989
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a preliminary settlement for the class action suit against Take-Two Interactive.

191
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,290
[SPEAKER_03]: For the hot coffee.

192
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, this is years old.

193
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:20,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

194
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:30,734
[SPEAKER_10]: So, basically, the terms of the settlement, the ones who can benefit from that is if they bought a copy of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas before July 20th, 2005.

195
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:41,052
[SPEAKER_10]: B, were offended by the game's content that used the hot coffee modification.

196
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:46,216
[SPEAKER_03]: That means they would have had... I was offended that I had to unlock it.

197
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:53,582
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they said they were upset by the ability to modify and alter the game.

198
00:14:55,323 --> 00:15:01,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was upset that you had to have an ability to do it and it wasn't just there, so can I have money?

199
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:02,529
[SPEAKER_10]: And that...

200
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:04,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

201
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:05,196
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

202
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:34,460
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still more money than GameStop will give you for it, so hey.

203
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much.

204
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:49,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Take-Two is committed to spend $1.025 million on the settlement benefits, and their out-of-pocket cost total is $2.75 million.

205
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:55,413
[SPEAKER_10]: and paying the court costs.

206
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:59,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Picaruno in our chatroom says, you can get free money if I say I'm offended by something?

207
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,555
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have your proof of purchase.

208
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:01,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to have the proof of purchase.

209
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:03,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the hell has a proof of purchase that late?

210
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:04,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

211
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:05,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's how they get around it.

212
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:10,118
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to save it for Grand Theft Auto 4 because I'm going to be highly offended by that someday.

213
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:11,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see how many people actually have it.

214
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:14,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly offended that I didn't get my $35 sooner.

215
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,242
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a statement, by the way, from Ben Fetter, who's the CEO of Take-Two.

216
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:33,766
[SPEAKER_10]: If the case had continued, we believe the court would have agreed that Take-Two was not liable for consumers acting independently to modify their games with third-party hardware and software to access normally inaccessible content.

217
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:42,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Nonetheless, we believe it is in the best interest of the company to avoid protracted and costly litigation to prove our case and to finally put this matter behind us.

218
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Gerardimo says, I'm offended by your offense.

219
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:51,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, our listener from Mexico who's listening, says, I'm suing the guys that made the Spanish training game.

220
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:53,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm offended and I need money.

221
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:54,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Spanish for everyone.

222
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:56,664
Awesome.

223
00:16:58,025 --> 00:16:58,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

224
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

225
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see if they're going to release figures on exactly how many people actually went and got money over this.

226
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:12,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be kind of curious to see how many people actually had the proof of purchases and actually went through the song and dance to do this.

227
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:13,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be kind of an interesting figure.

228
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet it's less than a couple thousand.

229
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:17,559
[SPEAKER_03]: If that, honestly.

230
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:19,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many people are going to think to do this?

231
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Most parents were pissed off and they moved on, right?

232
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:29,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, there's going to be letters that go out to anyone involved that put their name in with the lawsuit.

233
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

234
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:37,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so there's some interesting drama going on on the website, The Consumerist.

235
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:46,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, a PS3 owner had a problem with their PS3 not working, so they sent it in to be repaired.

236
00:17:47,408 --> 00:17:53,473
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, I guess, according to them, it was too dusty to be fixed.

237
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And they considered that it would, because of the dust, it was not covered under the warranty.

238
00:18:00,117 --> 00:18:06,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Uh-oh, my Wii's gonna be under, at a warranty as well then, with a thick layer of dust on that thing.

239
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they... Mario Galaxy's not out yet.

240
00:18:07,702 --> 00:18:10,685
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that it was an act of God or customer abuse.

241
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:10,985
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

242
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:13,377
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be under.

243
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:16,358
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was funny, though, because there was a follow-up to this as well.

244
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:21,000
[SPEAKER_03]: God has smited my PlayStation 3 with a thick layer of dust.

245
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,661
[SPEAKER_03]: The horror, the horror.

246
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:30,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was also a follow-up to that I remember reading that that whole statement, of course, is not really true.

247
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:32,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Sony does.

248
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Dust does not void your warranty as well.

249
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:39,829
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was in the later follow-up, I guess.

250
00:18:40,308 --> 00:19:08,656
[SPEAKER_04]: but this one lady that was adamant she said that she was like the head of the customer service department or something like that and anybody that they called you know oh and then the other thing too is the guy said well then hell you know take a picture of this dust and let me you know see what exactly you're talking about if it's so you know detrimental and they said oh no we can't take any pictures of that because all the pictures would be owned by Sony and then you can't you know see them without a subpoena or something like that you have to pay $150 to repair it out of warranty or something like that ugh

251
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:12,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chatroom is lighting up with conversation here.

252
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 says, it was an act of shitty games.

253
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:18,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, God made dirt and dirt don't hurt.

254
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I was just going to read some sections of this here.

255
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:30,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept my 60GB PS3 in an entertainment center since its purchase.

256
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:36,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It is known within the PS3 community that the thing is a huge dust magnet.

257
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:37,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I took good care of it.

258
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:40,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I have 10 Blu-ray discs that did not come free with my PS3.

259
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:41,858
[SPEAKER_04]: 5 games, 5 controllers.

260
00:19:42,118 --> 00:19:43,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck do you have 5 controllers?

261
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:45,909
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are you playing?

262
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:46,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Specialty Controller?

263
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,410
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA Live, I'm guessing, because that game supports up to 7.

264
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:53,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not NBA Live, NBA 08 or whatever, or 07.

265
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we get it.

266
00:19:56,152 --> 00:20:02,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Two 42-inch LCD TVs, one 50-inch Bravia LCD rear-production TV air, something like that.

267
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:05,034
[SPEAKER_04]: A VAIO desktop, VAIO laptop, blah, blah, blah.

268
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:10,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, one day I turn it on, I put a disc in it, and it doesn't show up, and it won't eject.

269
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, I get it to eject, and I try Blu-ray, and nothing, the CD's nothing.

270
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:20,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So I called customer support, who originally told me they can't do anything because I don't have the original sales receipt.

271
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:21,325
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a gift.

272
00:20:21,826 --> 00:20:28,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I stayed on the phone for hours explaining to them that I don't have the receipt because it was a gift.

273
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:32,639
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

274
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:01,266
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, was the owner Pigpen from Peanuts?

275
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:10,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And Azura May says, I hope I pronounced that right, says, PlayStation 3 weakness is dust, which makes me think of, like, the end of Signs.

276
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, it was water that was their weak point the whole time.

277
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:14,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's, like, dust.

278
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:18,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so, like, he goes back and forth, finally talking.

279
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:25,916
[SPEAKER_04]: The supervisor, who apparently was a bitch, named Daria Wu, extension 55682,

280
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:37,826
[SPEAKER_04]: basically told them that the PSP or picture of the PSP was property of Sony Computer Entertainment of America and that they would have to subpoena the pictures in order to see them.

281
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:40,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And blah blah blah.

282
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:43,267
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course at the very end he says I don't get it.

283
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony is including folding at home with their consoles.

284
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:49,708
[SPEAKER_04]: The auto start feature makes it so it's running almost all the time.

285
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:51,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it's going to be filled with dust.

286
00:21:51,808 --> 00:21:54,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Few reps said the reason they couldn't replace it is because it looked like at

287
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:59,587
[SPEAKER_04]: It had been two years worth of dust rather than eight months.

288
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:06,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The console hasn't even been out for years, so obviously that's less than a year's worth of dust.

289
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:14,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, he's all pissed off about it and wasn't going to stay quiet, and that's why everybody ran it.

290
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And then apparently, like I said, the follow-up, another consumer rep reported, I'm calling pretty much to clarify the PS3's warranty.

291
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:30,700
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any clause in the warranty that makes it so the PS3 is too dusty, that the warranty is void.

292
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rep said, no.

293
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:32,981
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

294
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:34,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And no.

295
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:40,724
[SPEAKER_04]: The only way that it voided is if it were neglected, abused, dropped, or anything like that.

296
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:43,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Modification, like if you opened it up...

297
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:50,410
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have the sales receipt, Power Failures, Mother Nature actually avoids the warranty.

298
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:55,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Christ, there's a Bible written on this whole thing, isn't there?

299
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

300
00:22:56,552 --> 00:22:57,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't they just fix it?

301
00:22:57,653 --> 00:23:01,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, they're... I don't know.

302
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:04,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The fucking system obviously hadn't been opened up.

303
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:04,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So what?

304
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dusty.

305
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:08,198
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing a horrible job of making a dust magnet.

306
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,359
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

307
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:15,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, I'm sure we're getting lots of colorful comments on that one.

308
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:20,628
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have something to contribute, if your PlayStation 3 has died due to dust, we'd love to hear from you.

309
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:21,088
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

310
00:23:21,288 --> 00:23:21,488
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

311
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a job for Dust Cap 2.

312
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to send us an email.

313
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie will be opening up the mailbag very soon, but we have one more story for you guys before we get to that point.

314
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:34,336
[SPEAKER_03]: and that would be about Warner Brothers.

315
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:41,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Warner Brothers has decided to purchase Traveler's Tales and the parent group TT Games.

316
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:46,245
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know Traveler's Tales from the Lego franchise as well.

317
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:48,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So Warner Brothers just wants to own that shit.

318
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

319
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:57,193
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, they'll be putting out Lego Batman very soon, which looks kind of awesome because I love old school Batman.

320
00:23:58,695 --> 00:23:59,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

321
00:24:00,325 --> 00:24:09,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well like I said, every week you guys send us email to mailbag at orangelongeradio.com And the one and only DarkSakura will open up the mailbag, dive on in, and read her favorite emails.

322
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:11,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe some of the ones she didn't like either.

323
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:12,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this is a good week.

324
00:24:13,173 --> 00:24:14,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, DarkSakura, was it a good email week?

325
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,075
[SPEAKER_03]: On a scale of 1 to 10?

326
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:18,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a 6, a 7?

327
00:24:19,697 --> 00:24:23,319
[SPEAKER_03]: R. It was an R. Okay, well anyway, I don't know how that works.

328
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,601
[SPEAKER_03]: But here goes DarkSakura with this week's mail.

329
00:24:25,661 --> 00:24:27,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at orangelongeradio.com

330
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,838
[SPEAKER_10]: The first email comes from Xenocore.

331
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:31,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, folks.

332
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:35,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I recently acquired a copy of Ore no Rioni for PS1.

333
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this game.

334
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,302
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the emulators I have used with the game don't give me precise control on all analog sticks.

335
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:47,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know of a better method to play this game, whether emulated or mod chip?

336
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:51,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have the initial launch PS2 and a 60 gigabyte PS3.

337
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:52,667
[SPEAKER_10]: What can I do?

338
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I love this game and can't wait to play it.

339
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:56,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

340
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,006
[SPEAKER_10]: What game?

341
00:24:58,026 --> 00:24:58,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Ore no Rionii

342
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:25,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I had never even heard of that game, I'm sorry to say.

343
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:31,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know we love obscure titles, but... No, not that one.

344
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:36,667
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I gotta say, the PlayStation 1, I'm not... That was kind of the period of my life where I wasn't gaming a whole lot.

345
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:41,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of the big games, like Final Fantasy VII and Symphony of the Night, but I missed a lot of shit during that period.

346
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:45,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that was when I was in college, and I was actually doing a little bit of work here and there.

347
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,030
[SPEAKER_03]: That was back in the day... Between Puzzle Fighter 2.

348
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That was back in the day when I was purchasing HK copies of...

349
00:25:52,455 --> 00:25:55,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Games, importing Ridge Racer 4 and shit like that.

350
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:58,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even Google can't find this.

351
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:00,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave it to the chat room to say something about it, though.

352
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:06,282
[SPEAKER_03]: The Flawless Bolt X says, Funny how someone mentions a PlayStation 1 game when last episode Loki said no one plays them anymore.

353
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:08,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, there's some irony.

354
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:11,725
[SPEAKER_03]: In the U.S.

355
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry we don't have much more for you, my friend.

356
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, we're going to be playing Vib Ribbon.

357
00:26:16,567 --> 00:26:16,787
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

358
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:17,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

359
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, but people that play PlayStation... Let me put it this way, though.

360
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:31,588
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play a PlayStation 1 game right now, you're probably either playing it on a PSP, whether it be modded or not, or you're probably playing it on a PlayStation 1 that you already have.

361
00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:33,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think people are out there.

362
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:40,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's people out there that want to play Final Fantasy 7 or something like that to try it out, but I don't think there's actually people out there that are like, you know what?

363
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:45,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to buy a brand new PlayStation 1 and some PlayStation 1 games.

364
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people don't really go back that far.

365
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, we weren't much help on that one.

366
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,559
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not experts on everything.

367
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Just most things.

368
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But congratulations for stumping the host.

369
00:26:57,722 --> 00:26:59,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some free rice-a-roni.

370
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't find anything about that game.

371
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:04,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we get an email from Thomas.

372
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:06,026
[SPEAKER_10]: It says, OLR equals win.

373
00:27:06,046 --> 00:27:08,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Thomas.

374
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And we get one from Robert M.,

375
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Freudian Slip

376
00:27:23,314 --> 00:27:25,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie, how dare you insult the listeners?

377
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:26,255
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

378
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:26,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

379
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:29,997
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did go ahead and purchase that on iTunes Store.

380
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:34,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I have only two complaints, which are issues with all iPods games so far.

381
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,720
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, it uses a lot of battery power while playing.

382
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:50,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, any session between syncing the iPod with your computer with iTunes in which FaZe is played even once appears to clear out your play counts for all podcasts and songs, which isn't even an issue if you don't care about play counts, but it can be problematic for podcasts.

383
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It's playing FaZe to a podcast.

384
00:27:53,328 --> 00:27:54,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that might be interesting.

385
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:55,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not.

386
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:58,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, the game is a lot of fun, simple but addictive.

387
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:00,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of it uses the back, select, and forward buttons.

388
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:08,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Tap to the beat of the music following on-screen scrolling options with a great artistic style surrounding it.

389
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:14,839
[SPEAKER_10]: A few parts use the scroll wheel to follow a line for bonus points, which build up stars needed to pass checkpoints.

390
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:25,061
[SPEAKER_10]: It usually works equally as well with songs you add to the playlist in iTunes as it does with its built-in songs, including new songs by Freeze Pop, Bang Camaro, among others.

391
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:25,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

392
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:27,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Highly recommended for fans of music games.

393
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:31,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought my PS3 from Kmart and now they stopped selling Blu-ray discs?

394
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Those damn traitors.

395
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:38,803
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the person with the really cool signature that says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of Neverending Salads.

396
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:55,135
[SPEAKER_03]: and Breadsticks.

397
00:28:55,175 --> 00:28:55,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget Breadsticks.

398
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:57,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want any more salad.

399
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be more salad for you.

400
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:02,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, never mind.

401
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,303
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say something but I lost.

402
00:29:04,323 --> 00:29:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: My train derailed.

403
00:29:05,725 --> 00:29:06,345
[SPEAKER_03]: My train of thought.

404
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:08,327
[SPEAKER_03]: The salad destroyed your train.

405
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:11,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I started thinking about the Olive Garden and the Olive Garden's awesome.

406
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have a long one.

407
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray for long emails.

408
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:30,178
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually being sent to us by, well, if I just say Rick, because he didn't put a nickname in there, but it seems like he's from the UK.

409
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:30,919
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

410
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:32,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, guys.

411
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know if you get the reference.

412
00:29:34,702 --> 00:29:35,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

413
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:39,105
[SPEAKER_10]: It started with GameSpot, and then it expanded to IGN.

414
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:42,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I found this link to OLR on a random podcast site.

415
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:46,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Now my crack-like habit of listening to gaming podcasts creeps into my working day.

416
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:48,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I own a Wii.

417
00:30:10,163 --> 00:30:13,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it may not seem as a hardcore system, but I love it.

418
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:17,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I have owned every incarnation of Nintendo's system and enjoyed them all.

419
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:18,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, even the N64.

420
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:20,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark was cool, apart from the last level.

421
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:30,250
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have never had a hardware failure with any of them, apart from when I made smoke come out of the back of my Super NES after playing Desert Strike for 24 hours solid.

422
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:30,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

423
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Hardcore.

424
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'd say hardcore, more so fanboy.

425
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:37,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right.

426
00:30:37,915 --> 00:30:38,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a crime.

427
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:07,981
[SPEAKER_10]: After frantically searching the internet, I found that the problem was with the video card on the Wii overheating.

428
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:12,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I rang the nice people at Nintendo and sent it away and after two weeks they returned it back to me all fixed.

429
00:31:12,683 --> 00:31:14,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I am happy to say it all looks fab.

430
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:16,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this a common fault?

431
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:19,306
[SPEAKER_10]: I have never heard any of this on any podcast before.

432
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:22,347
[SPEAKER_10]: The 360 has its own podcast named after its notorious issues.

433
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:24,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, keep up the good work.

434
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:28,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to hear my email on your show as I am a big fan and you always seem to have fun.

435
00:31:28,857 --> 00:31:30,318
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

436
00:31:58,922 --> 00:31:59,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it playing that noise?

437
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:03,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I forgot to hit stop earlier and it was playing the Portal song from earlier.

438
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:07,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I did find... Sorry, the show.

439
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:07,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, IGN.

440
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:08,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's show was a lie.

441
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:14,515
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but what it was is that apparently it's... Yeah, we found some information on the game on IGN.

442
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:20,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it was a cooking simulator and it was the first DualShock enhanced cooking simulator on the market.

443
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,001
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't on the Dreamcast.

444
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It just came out the same day as the Dreamcast.

445
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But they did have a demo in the US.

446
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:25,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

447
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:27,005
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation Underground.

448
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:30,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been over Cooking Mama for about a month now, you know.

449
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:30,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I have to get it.

450
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I wanted to say to our... I want to make a cake.

451
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to say to our hardcore fan overseas that you are not the first person to have an exploding Wii.

452
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:52,122
[SPEAKER_03]: That particular issue, I think, is the first time I've heard of that.

453
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:56,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, nobody else I've ever heard compares it to hemorrhoid, whatever.

454
00:32:56,222 --> 00:32:56,943
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of weird.

455
00:32:57,523 --> 00:33:01,443
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, every system is going to have some that break.

456
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:04,004
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's just some faulty stuff on the assembly line.

457
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:06,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that comes off an assembly line is going to have a fault once in a while.

458
00:33:07,224 --> 00:33:10,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That game, Counter Force, kind of looked like a bursting hemorrhoid, but, you know, that's just...

459
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:13,706
[SPEAKER_03]: That game, I guess.

460
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:19,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem was, at least with the Xbox 360, that Red Rings of Death was very prevalent.

461
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:24,892
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people had that issue, and that's why it's become almost like a pop culture gag within the gaming scene.

462
00:33:24,932 --> 00:33:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know there was a podcast called Red Rings of Death, but I'm somehow not surprised.

463
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:33,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's why it's become such a phenomenon and why Microsoft had to specifically extend the warranty.

464
00:33:34,477 --> 00:33:35,438
[SPEAKER_03]: To Nintendo's credit...

465
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:37,101
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

466
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:05,669
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's more.

467
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:06,450
[SPEAKER_10]: More.

468
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I finish the email?

469
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:08,171
[SPEAKER_10]: More.

470
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:08,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

471
00:34:09,872 --> 00:34:10,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Spelled M-O-A-R.

472
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:12,493
[SPEAKER_10]: P.S.

473
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:15,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the fuck is my strategy game for the Wii?

474
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:17,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Surely it's perfect for Command & Conquer.

475
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I would even settle for Red Alert Graphics.

476
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:22,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that asking too much?

477
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:22,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

478
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay then, Tiberium Wars?

479
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:27,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

480
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:27,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

481
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:29,065
[SPEAKER_03]: are there any strategy games?

482
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:52,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Battalion Wars 2 maybe and then Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn but Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn unfortunately is apparently very much like the last game that came out in the GameCube almost exactly the same but we like Fire Emblem I just hate playing strategy games myself oh and a question for me

483
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:54,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you ever play Cannon Fodder?

484
00:34:54,644 --> 00:34:57,246
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an awesome game, also should be remade for the Wii.

485
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,847
[SPEAKER_10]: War has never been so much fun, and so on.

486
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:02,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I know of it, I actually have not played it.

487
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,550
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds familiar.

488
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never played it either.

489
00:35:06,692 --> 00:35:09,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet another game stumping the panel here at Orange Library.

490
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:10,834
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think I did play it.

491
00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:14,036
[SPEAKER_10]: We've talked about Cannon Fodder on the show before, I thought.

492
00:35:16,978 --> 00:35:19,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in a while, but I do believe that we have.

493
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:24,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Escapist says in our chatroom, Cannon Fodder was good, General Chaos was better.

494
00:35:25,252 --> 00:35:30,534
[SPEAKER_03]: See, when in doubt, when we're stumped, we always have the chatroom and plenty of people there to rely on, on their gaming knowledge as well.

495
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:32,815
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one more last bit to this email.

496
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, this goes on forever.

497
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:35,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye!

498
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,697
[SPEAKER_10]: It's capitalized, I had to say it that way.

499
00:35:38,717 --> 00:35:39,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

500
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:39,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye.

501
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Last, last email.

502
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:42,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Dun dun dun.

503
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:59,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Dearest OLR, with Journey of Dreams and a new Samba de Amigo coming to Wii and Rez coming to Xbox Live Arcade, which I think was Sega?

504
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:04,652
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems Sega is giving gamers a chance to play some of their better games that were probably missed by most people.

505
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:10,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those that should have remained missed, yes.

506
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:16,356
[SPEAKER_10]: If this is the case, I was wondering which Shaggy games you would like to see remade slash sequelized slash playable again.

507
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:19,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I would love to see Space Channel 5 on Wii.

508
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:25,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's one of the few games I would like to play by shaking the Wii mode around, but only if Space Michael still has a part in it.

509
00:36:25,543 --> 00:36:26,904
[SPEAKER_03]: You took my answer, jerk.

510
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:29,686
[SPEAKER_03]: You took my answer, Gerardimo, you jerk.

511
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:32,448
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I would have said is Space Channel 5.

512
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:33,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what am I going to say?

513
00:36:33,368 --> 00:36:33,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Space Channel 5 2.

514
00:36:35,034 --> 00:36:36,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

515
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,671
[SPEAKER_10]: They even do the freaking Thriller Dance, and I think that's fantastic.

516
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:59,755
[SPEAKER_03]: How about another Crazy Taxi game, but like a good one, not a cheap knockoff.

517
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:02,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, Crazy Taxi kind of jumped the shark because there was like sequel after sequel.

518
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,865
[SPEAKER_03]: How about like a remade, really good Crazy Taxi that has more than just the offspring as the music?

519
00:37:09,165 --> 00:37:09,986
[SPEAKER_10]: They had Bad Religion.

520
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:11,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

521
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:12,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Set Radio?

522
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:13,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

523
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:13,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

524
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:19,398
[SPEAKER_10]: That's another thing that we need is definitely another Jet Set Radio because I freaking love that game.

525
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:21,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd One agrees with that.

526
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Jet Set Radio, doing the graffiti with the Wiimote would be awesome.

527
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:27,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you'd have to do it in that pattern, right?

528
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:31,227
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says Space Harrier and fuck Planet Harrier.

529
00:37:31,247 --> 00:37:32,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Planet Harrier.

530
00:37:32,408 --> 00:37:32,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

531
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I love Space Harrier, but the thing is that I could not imagine Space Harrier updated.

532
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:41,016
[SPEAKER_10]: The best version...

533
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:44,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I got one for you that's perfect for Xbox Live.

534
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:44,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantasy Zone.

535
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:45,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell yeah!

536
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:10,913
[SPEAKER_10]: They fully need to put out fantasies on it.

537
00:38:10,973 --> 00:38:15,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Except I think that it would be kind of... You would have to do it, though, classic controller only, I think.

538
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how about... You know what game we haven't seen an incarnation of in a long time is Alex Kidd.

539
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:23,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring me some Alex Kidd.

540
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:30,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's actually going to be coming out here pretty soon, in January, I think, is that Sega Bass Fishing.

541
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:32,112
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what that is...

542
00:38:32,905 --> 00:38:36,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's remember the one on the Dreamcast with the fishing rod.

543
00:38:36,287 --> 00:38:37,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, with the rod caliber.

544
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that game gave us rod caliber.

545
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:41,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

546
00:38:41,189 --> 00:38:47,332
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that I've mentioned this on the show a bunch of times, but you could play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod, and it was really cool.

547
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,133
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can actually play that Soul Calibur Legends.

548
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:53,415
[SPEAKER_04]: They have that fishing rod that comes with hooked real motion fishing.

549
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:54,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you tried it?

550
00:38:55,076 --> 00:39:02,099
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have not tried that game because, well, one, I don't want to buy hooked because it's a fishing game, and I don't.

551
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't find fishing fun.

552
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:07,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Simulating fishing I think would be even less fun.

553
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:09,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

554
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:16,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, any more emails?

555
00:39:17,163 --> 00:39:20,385
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually got one from Rob with Two Bees.

556
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a link to a story about a boy who hired a hitman to kill his parents for PlayStation punishment.

557
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:27,330
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny.

558
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:34,364
[SPEAKER_10]: A boy, these parents told their son they couldn't play his PlayStation for poor grades and bad behavior.

559
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And the son tried to hire a hitman.

560
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:40,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, what's this world coming to?

561
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:52,478
[SPEAKER_10]: These people in Maryland, Shannon and Joey Troiano from Maryland punished their son Corey by confiscating their PlayStation and hiding it and banned him from watching TV.

562
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,881
[SPEAKER_10]: So he tried to hire a hitman.

563
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,341
[SPEAKER_10]: and his mom actually set him up for a sting.

564
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:02,301
[SPEAKER_03]: God, that kid's retarded.

565
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:05,782
[SPEAKER_03]: What in the hell is wrong with this family?

566
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:12,504
[SPEAKER_10]: He promised that he would give him his stepfather's new pickup as payment for killing his parents.

567
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:15,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

568
00:40:16,885 --> 00:40:19,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody was actually going to kill these people over a pickup?

569
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:19,586
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

570
00:40:19,726 --> 00:40:24,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was a really nice pickup.

571
00:40:25,745 --> 00:40:26,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow doubt that.

572
00:40:26,826 --> 00:40:27,626
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy talk.

573
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:28,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

574
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:29,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

575
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:37,474
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's quoted as saying, I miss him being at home and I miss us joking around and kidding around but in the same breath I don't know what this kid will do because that's not my son.

576
00:40:38,214 --> 00:40:39,755
[SPEAKER_10]: That can't be my little boy sitting there.

577
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:40,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

578
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:45,840
[SPEAKER_10]: It said that his behavior got worse ever since his father left.

579
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Rosemary's Baby or The Omen or something crazy there.

580
00:40:49,843 --> 00:40:50,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

581
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:53,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more emails to depress us?

582
00:40:54,741 --> 00:40:56,962
[SPEAKER_10]: So that he dropped out of school and stole 45 bucks.

583
00:40:56,982 --> 00:40:58,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

584
00:40:58,783 --> 00:40:59,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

585
00:40:59,063 --> 00:41:00,064
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy sounds like a real winner.

586
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:01,105
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

587
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:01,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's it.

588
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:02,505
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for emails.

589
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:05,427
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

590
00:41:05,467 --> 00:41:06,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, more news.

591
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:08,769
[SPEAKER_03]: News.

592
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:09,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

593
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So some pretty cool stuff.

594
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:20,996
[SPEAKER_04]: According to Valve, they're adding the Orange Box games to the source software development kit.

595
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:23,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means that you guys can go out there.

596
00:41:23,612 --> 00:41:25,474
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

597
00:41:47,100 --> 00:42:13,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Valve's custom face poser tool that allows users to produce choreographed sequences in the Source Engine, a model viewer that allows artists to preview models and animations quickly, a source code that allows mod makers to create their own games based off of Half-Life 2 or Half-Life 2 Deathmatch, and all the tools required to make, build custom textures and models for Source Engine games.

598
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:15,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

599
00:42:16,553 --> 00:42:18,174
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole lot of cool stuff.

600
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:28,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've actually seen there were some custom maps out there, mods or something like that, with Portal that actually had some gravity modifiers in there as well.

601
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:31,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Like different sections of the map had different gravity and whatnot.

602
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:33,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be kind of cool.

603
00:42:37,568 --> 00:42:38,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, all right.

604
00:42:39,213 --> 00:42:40,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

605
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:02,642
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's ways.

606
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:10,047
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put in a code where you can shoot portals anywhere on any surface, you can actually get it to where you can clip through the walls sometimes.

607
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:26,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but there's also, I think it is kind of cool that the whole credit sequence when you're going through where the pipes are, you can actually, there is a glitch where you can go into that area because it is fully rendered and in the game.

608
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:32,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's been a healthy donation of some SimCity made by EA.

609
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:36,880
[SPEAKER_03]: You've probably heard of the One Laptop per Child program.

610
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,001
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something where they were going to actually put laptops in classrooms in other countries for children in the classroom.

611
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:50,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, EA has actually donated the original version of SimCity to be pre-installed on all machines.

612
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:52,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Pony the Money for SimCity 2000

613
00:44:12,922 --> 00:44:13,483
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

614
00:44:13,503 --> 00:44:14,383
[SPEAKER_03]: The classic is way better.

615
00:44:14,423 --> 00:44:15,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate SimCity 2, though.

616
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:17,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's also the laptop's pretty old.

617
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, well, not pretty.

618
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:19,447
[SPEAKER_03]: They're $100, hello.

619
00:44:19,648 --> 00:44:22,810
[SPEAKER_03]: The processor in it's not exactly powerful and stuff, so.

620
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, look, as long as they play Oregon Trail, what else do you need?

621
00:44:25,112 --> 00:44:26,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what kids need in school.

622
00:44:26,093 --> 00:44:27,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, that's what it would have been.

623
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:28,194
[SPEAKER_10]: So then they would need a Mac.

624
00:44:29,676 --> 00:44:31,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just an Apple IIe with the green monitor.

625
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:32,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Apple IIe.

626
00:44:33,459 --> 00:44:34,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are the shit.

627
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want all these kids to learn Logo.

628
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:36,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

629
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:42,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Pen down, forward 20, right 90, forward 20, right 90.

630
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:44,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, guess what?

631
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:45,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Atari 2600 news.

632
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:55,979
[SPEAKER_10]: The Atari 2600 has been inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at the Strong National Museum of Play.

633
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,001
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what the other two things that were inducted were along with it?

634
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:04,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Raggedy Ann, no, Raggedy Andy, sorry, and the Kite.

635
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:09,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but with toys.

636
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:09,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

637
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:22,403
[SPEAKER_10]: The museum's curator has said that the Atari system paved the way for today's gaming consoles and, quote, mesmerized a generation with games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Frogger.

638
00:45:23,604 --> 00:45:24,184
[SPEAKER_03]: The kite.

639
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:28,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty cool.

640
00:45:31,386 --> 00:45:35,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying... Yeah, apparently it's also in there with the teddy bear, roller skates, and Mr. Potato Head.

641
00:45:37,149 --> 00:45:38,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Light Bright is the greatest toy of all time.

642
00:45:57,577 --> 00:45:58,499
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

643
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:16,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I would never use the things that came with them.

644
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:17,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I made my own pictures.

645
00:46:17,831 --> 00:46:18,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Me neither.

646
00:46:18,251 --> 00:46:19,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put, I make patterns.

647
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:20,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Patterns are my thing.

648
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:21,333
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what I found?

649
00:46:21,934 --> 00:46:25,116
[SPEAKER_10]: At a yard sale like a year ago, I found Transformers light bright patterns.

650
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:25,956
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

651
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:26,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So I kept them.

652
00:46:26,937 --> 00:46:27,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought them.

653
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:28,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally want a light bright.

654
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:31,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't you imagine putting a light bright here on the shelf with a mirror on it?

655
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Guys, listeners, find us a light bright.

656
00:46:33,941 --> 00:46:34,542
[SPEAKER_10]: We implore.

657
00:46:34,782 --> 00:46:36,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to, I swear to God I'm going to yard sales.

658
00:46:36,923 --> 00:46:37,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to eBay right now.

659
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:38,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do.

660
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:39,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

661
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:45,793
[SPEAKER_04]: In case you've been living under a rock, the Writers Guild of America is striking right now.

662
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a surprise.

663
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:54,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so what that means is a lot of movie productions have halted.

664
00:46:54,939 --> 00:47:00,303
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of those movies that's kind of been put on the brakes, I guess, Wolfenstein.

665
00:47:01,544 --> 00:47:06,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sci-Fi Wire apparently is reporting that the script is almost done.

666
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:35,181
[SPEAKER_04]: um but everything as far as the production date and that kind of thing won't be decided until after all of this is over and of course um you know Roger Avery fully supports the strike and yeah so darn we guess we have to wait for a Wolvenstein movie uh just a thought it's probably gonna suck so take your time

667
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:40,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the movie sucks, I will go on strike from doing this program.

668
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:54,216
[SPEAKER_04]: There was somebody, somebody commented, I want to say it was on Any Cool News or something like that, and I'm sure people have made the same kind of comments, that TV watchers and movie watchers should have their own guild and strike when there's like crappy movies.

669
00:47:54,376 --> 00:47:55,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Refuse to watch them.

670
00:47:55,397 --> 00:47:58,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Why the hell does a Light Bright have $52 shipping on it?

671
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:00,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Christ.

672
00:48:00,322 --> 00:48:00,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

673
00:48:00,782 --> 00:48:01,683
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a light truck.

674
00:48:02,429 --> 00:48:04,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the ones, I found the Light Bright for $25.

675
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:10,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the whole Rider Strike thing does kind of, I mean, it's unfortunate.

676
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:18,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the reason why it has $52 shipping is probably because the sale price, if it's cheap enough, they don't have to pay as much of an eBay tax, I guess, on that thing.

677
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:21,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the, you know, eBay doesn't get as big of a portion.

678
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:24,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that way they can just make it all up in shipping.

679
00:48:25,218 --> 00:48:25,798
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cheap.

680
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,039
[SPEAKER_04]: That's working the system.

681
00:48:28,759 --> 00:48:30,420
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to have one with a buy it now on here.

682
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

683
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to point out that Marissa in our chat room says, Light Bright has become modern with Light Bright flat screen.

684
00:48:40,426 --> 00:48:43,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I want an old one like the one I had from 1982.

685
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:47,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you find an Etch-A-Sketch while you're at it?

686
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:50,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I found a 1986 Light Bright refill pack.

687
00:48:50,535 --> 00:48:50,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Rad.

688
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have to get that so we get plenty of orange pigs.

689
00:48:53,878 --> 00:48:57,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, something else from the 80s that is awesome is The Last Starfighter.

690
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:57,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

691
00:48:58,971 --> 00:49:20,858
[SPEAKER_03]: and remember how the last Starfighter had like a video game kind of in it but it was never actually a game it was supposed to be a game but it wasn't well what happened is that this guy actually put together a copy of the Starfighter game and actually put it in the cabinet Atari had made this full final version of the game but they never actually put it out but thanks to the love

692
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:45,219
[SPEAKER_03]: and Hard Cornus for lack of a better term of this guy he can now play Starfighter in his house I mean this comes complete with like the levers and everything this isn't just in any old cabinet this isn't like an actual cabinet like the one from the movie if you want to see this for yourself Roguesynapse.com let me spell that for you guys R-O-G-U-E-S-Y-N-A-P-S-E dot com you found a virtual light bright?

693
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:50,321
[SPEAKER_03]: one of our chatters linked it that's just not as cool I'm sorry to say I appreciate the effort but

694
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,178
[SPEAKER_03]: RogueSynapse.com

695
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:21,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Being put out by Aniplex's A1 Pictures.

696
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:40,327
[SPEAKER_10]: They are adapting it for, it's actually going to be called Persona Trinity Soul in January 2008, which is set a decade after the game and will center around three brothers in a city where the dead have turned their skins inside out.

697
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:41,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

698
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:42,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

699
00:50:43,088 --> 00:50:43,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll probably watch it.

700
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:44,808
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds really cool.

701
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that kind of like the guy in PBS?

702
00:50:46,489 --> 00:50:46,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

703
00:50:48,223 --> 00:50:48,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

704
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:54,084
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that love their Persona, so this is, I'm sure, good news to a lot of the fans of Persona 3.

705
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:56,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

706
00:50:57,325 --> 00:50:59,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside out, man.

707
00:50:59,645 --> 00:51:01,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

708
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:11,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So, speaking of eBay earlier, if you're desperate for some celebrity memorabilia, eBay, of course, is the place to find it.

709
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:17,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And since this is vaguely game-related, Gary Coleman is selling his GameCube

710
00:51:17,915 --> 00:51:20,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, times are pretty hard for old Gary.

711
00:51:21,296 --> 00:51:27,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course he is signing his GameCube as well as the games coming with it.

712
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:34,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Which if I remember correctly, there was one from Robots, the movie, the game, and some other crap in there.

713
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,761
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see here.

714
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:41,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're interested in it, only $510 right now is the going price for it.

715
00:51:47,423 --> 00:51:49,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Mortal Kombat Deception, Super Smash Bros.

716
00:51:49,664 --> 00:51:57,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Melee, Mario Kart Double Dash, Sonic 2 Adventure Battle, and Sonic Gems Collection.

717
00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:00,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

718
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:06,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gary Coleman has signed each one of those things, so now you can own a piece of Gary.

719
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:08,853
[SPEAKER_04]: A little itty-bitty piece.

720
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:10,294
[SPEAKER_10]: He's welcome to keep it.

721
00:52:10,474 --> 00:52:15,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Former gubernatorial candidate here in California.

722
00:52:15,936 --> 00:52:17,618
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember when Gary Coleman ran for governor.

723
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:19,399
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't even freaking make the top ten.

724
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:19,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

725
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:23,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Although that one porn star did.

726
00:52:23,883 --> 00:52:24,644
[SPEAKER_03]: She was in the top ten.

727
00:52:24,784 --> 00:52:26,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary Carey or whatever she was.

728
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:27,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I totally supported her.

729
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't she promising a blowjob for everyone that voted for her?

730
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:32,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

731
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,791
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my vote.

732
00:52:54,008 --> 00:52:55,269
[SPEAKER_10]: But I want an old school one, yo.

733
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:56,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifteen bucks for that.

734
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:57,210
[SPEAKER_10]: No way.

735
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I want an old, old one.

736
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want an old school one.

737
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the kind that gets so hot that you can't touch it.

738
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:02,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

739
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:03,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know what you can do with that?

740
00:53:04,534 --> 00:53:06,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Light bright companion cube.

741
00:53:08,356 --> 00:53:08,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

742
00:53:08,957 --> 00:53:09,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time.

743
00:53:09,657 --> 00:53:11,738
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm going to do as soon as I learn how to sew?

744
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:15,640
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to make myself a weighted companion cube purse.

745
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:19,603
[SPEAKER_03]: People are crazy about their weighted companion cube.

746
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:23,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have not played Portal, so these jokes go over my head.

747
00:53:24,962 --> 00:53:31,605
[SPEAKER_03]: But this joke I get, and I think it's hilarious, because one of the first games I ever remember playing on the Commodore 64 was Zork.

748
00:53:32,486 --> 00:53:44,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And Zork has apparently been smooshed with Pac-Man to create this homegrown game, Pact TXT, and it's available for play at pac-txt.com.

749
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pac-Man meets Zork.

750
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:48,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, it's as stupid as it sounds.

751
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:52,435
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually play Pac-Man, but it's in Zork format.

752
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,816
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, you go, EAT!

753
00:53:54,737 --> 00:53:57,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You have eaten another glowing dot and you type forward.

754
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:58,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You have moved forward.

755
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So stupid it's hilarious, but I'm sure it will get old in about five minutes.

756
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:06,984
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

757
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:14,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, if you would like to give us a call, our Skype line is now open for business.

758
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:17,910
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

759
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:23,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt we'll have anything as exciting as the Nintendo World Store call from earlier and Zaku actually sounding not high this week

760
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:25,708
[SPEAKER_03]: But who knows?

761
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:28,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure our folks will try.

762
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:34,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So meanwhile, while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a delay, let's see if there's any last minute stories from here in chat.

763
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:36,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Or here in studio.

764
00:54:36,752 --> 00:54:38,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I'm not a chat.

765
00:54:38,353 --> 00:54:38,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a me.

766
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:38,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

767
00:54:39,133 --> 00:54:39,453
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad.

768
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:42,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, here's an interesting one.

769
00:54:42,874 --> 00:54:43,154
[SPEAKER_04]: E.G.,

770
00:54:45,546 --> 00:54:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Anamura was interviewed in the last issue of Official Nintendo Magazine.

771
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:51,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that's in the UK.

772
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:57,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about what his interests are in the Legend of Zelda series and how he'd like to continue it.

773
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:01,776
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing he's interested in doing is a 3D remake of A Link to the Past.

774
00:55:02,336 --> 00:55:03,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Which would be fucking awesome.

775
00:55:03,857 --> 00:55:04,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope they do that.

776
00:55:04,597 --> 00:55:05,738
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fucking awesome.

777
00:55:05,798 --> 00:55:07,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And do it in the Wind Waker engine.

778
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,180
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this fucking Twilight Princess shit.

779
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're getting a phone call.

780
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:11,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go take it.

781
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:12,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

782
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:12,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

783
00:55:13,675 --> 00:55:14,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I'm on!

784
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,298
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Odd1 from the chat room.

785
00:55:17,798 --> 00:55:18,859
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, what was your name again?

786
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Odd1.

787
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:20,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Odd1!

788
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:22,002
[SPEAKER_03]: O-D-D-O-N-E.

789
00:55:22,242 --> 00:55:22,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

790
00:55:22,682 --> 00:55:23,463
[SPEAKER_03]: You made it.

791
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:26,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a first-time live listener tonight, right?

792
00:55:27,526 --> 00:55:30,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for years while I was working.

793
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:35,993
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys got me through some really tough, long hours, and I'm so grateful to you guys.

794
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

795
00:55:36,614 --> 00:55:37,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say thanks.

796
00:55:37,895 --> 00:55:38,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

797
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:43,239
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's words like that that seriously keep us motivated, because, you know, we do this

798
00:55:43,934 --> 00:55:44,494
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

799
00:56:11,397 --> 00:56:13,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I didn't think I'd get through.

800
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:14,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have much on my mind.

801
00:56:14,118 --> 00:56:15,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to say thanks.

802
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:19,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And now that I get free time, I'm going to be listening live every week.

803
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, you guys are just the best.

804
00:56:23,121 --> 00:56:23,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

805
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:24,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

806
00:56:24,502 --> 00:56:26,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then tell us about your gaming week real quick.

807
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:27,503
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll ask you questions.

808
00:56:27,543 --> 00:56:28,384
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

809
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:29,324
[SPEAKER_03]: What games have you been playing?

810
00:56:31,505 --> 00:56:34,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, all I got here is a GameCube right now.

811
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:36,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Gary Coleman's GameCube?

812
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:36,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

813
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no good at all.

814
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:41,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a money thing.

815
00:56:41,948 --> 00:56:42,908
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stolen system thing.

816
00:56:42,968 --> 00:56:44,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even want to go into it.

817
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:47,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you had $400 in your pocket right now, enough to buy any of the next-gen systems.

818
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one would you buy and why?

819
00:57:05,428 --> 00:57:14,634
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'd probably buy a Wii and about 20 million of those Wii points because especially with the Neo Geo, the virtual console is just hot.

820
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:16,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I need that in my life.

821
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:17,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hot.

822
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:21,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Like seriously, my Wii wasn't even plugged in for about three weeks.

823
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:27,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And I finally went and plugged it back in today because I wanted to check out some of the new stuff like the Check Me Out channel and Mario 3.

824
00:57:28,084 --> 00:57:32,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went back on and I saw that Simon's Quest was on virtual console and I completely forgot about it.

825
00:57:33,151 --> 00:57:36,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I saw it, I seriously, I think I got a semi.

826
00:57:36,315 --> 00:57:37,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that game is so awesome.

827
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:42,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the shitty translation, it's fun.

828
00:57:42,243 --> 00:57:43,785
[SPEAKER_03]: What a terrible night to have a curse.

829
00:57:45,988 --> 00:57:46,608
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game Is Alive.

830
00:58:10,217 --> 00:58:14,619
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't want to hook up the whole Dreamcast and burn the CD or whatever.

831
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,861
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about it that just, I don't know, is worth the five bucks.

832
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:23,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, and also, you know, I associate my computer with work.

833
00:58:23,993 --> 00:58:30,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play on it, but when I want to relax, I get on my couch and turn on my TV.

834
00:58:30,495 --> 00:58:31,055
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.

835
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:35,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to play games on the computer that were originally designed for the console.

836
00:58:35,296 --> 00:58:39,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like World of Warcraft or PC developed games, I have no problem playing those on the PC.

837
00:58:39,237 --> 00:58:42,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think I have so many video game systems?

838
00:58:42,858 --> 00:58:44,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can sit on the couch.

839
00:58:44,578 --> 00:58:50,320
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can sit on my couch and use my original controller and play the game.

840
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,280
[SPEAKER_08]: There you have it.

841
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:53,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

842
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:54,203
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

843
00:58:54,304 --> 00:58:55,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm going to let you go.

844
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:57,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for taking my call.

845
00:58:57,484 --> 00:58:58,685
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem, Odd1.

846
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:00,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very nice to hear such enthusiasm.

847
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:02,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes us even more excited.

848
00:59:02,266 --> 00:59:03,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Odd1, for your call.

849
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:03,986
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.

850
00:59:04,026 --> 00:59:04,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

851
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:05,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

852
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:07,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

853
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:10,808
[SPEAKER_03]: He just had so much enthusiasm, like was generally happy to be on the show.

854
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:11,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.

855
00:59:11,788 --> 00:59:12,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So great.

856
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:12,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

857
00:59:13,229 --> 00:59:13,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to another call.

[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Azorme.

[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, yeah, I just wanted to talk about, uh, just, like, an overall, the gaming this year.

[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, it's like, this week, Mario Galaxy and Assassin's Creed is coming out.

865
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:36,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Do y'all find it hard to keep up with all these games?

866
00:59:38,298 --> 00:59:45,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I know we have, like, every, like, you're married, uh, Loki, along with, uh, DarkSakura.

867
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:48,974
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a huge week for games.

868
00:59:48,994 --> 00:59:50,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is feedback.

869
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,279
[SPEAKER_03]: With Christmas and everything, it's just like everything is coming out this week.

870
00:59:56,961 --> 01:00:01,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm trying to say, do you get a chance to actually play them all?

871
01:00:01,105 --> 01:00:03,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you find yourself able to play them?

872
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:04,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

873
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:08,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, as if you would play, like, you know, do you get all your fun out of them, like your money's worth?

874
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:10,333
[SPEAKER_10]: What was it?

875
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:12,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have time to play all these games?

876
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:15,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have time to play all these games that come out?

877
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:32,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally do not, just given that I have a very busy schedule.

878
01:00:32,553 --> 01:00:37,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't gone into a lot of detail on this, but I'm working on an illustration project.

879
01:00:37,878 --> 01:00:40,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still going to classes as a massage therapist.

880
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:43,003
[SPEAKER_10]: I work as a massage therapist, too.

881
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:51,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And with my full-time job, I don't have as much time as I would like to play some of these games, although I am dedicating time to Portal next week.

882
01:00:51,762 --> 01:00:53,224
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

883
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:10,805
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends trying to get me into Tabula Rasa, which I really want to check out.

884
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:15,306
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just all these freaking MMOs I keep getting sucked into, and those are games that never finish.

885
01:01:15,566 --> 01:01:18,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just keep going back for more, and I never have time to play the console games.

886
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:21,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do try to play a little bit of everything.

887
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:26,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what makes it so easy to stay on top of the Xbox Live Arcade releases and everything.

888
01:01:26,389 --> 01:01:29,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are delivered right to your doorstep, and they're usually really short games.

889
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:33,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to sample as much as I can, but I may not play everything.

890
01:01:33,351 --> 01:01:34,271
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, right now,

891
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

892
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:48,496
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

893
01:02:10,915 --> 01:02:17,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, if we have more free games, we could easily dedicate, you know, an hour between three of us, you know, playing games or whatever.

894
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,667
[SPEAKER_10]: The last free game I got was Dragon's Lair HD.

895
01:02:20,228 --> 01:02:22,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the last free game we got.

896
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:26,717
[SPEAKER_04]: The last free game I got, and I don't want it, and I will be selling it back.

897
01:02:27,284 --> 01:02:28,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Viva Pinata Party Animals.

898
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:29,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, sorry to hear it.

899
01:02:30,005 --> 01:02:30,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I take that back.

900
01:02:30,626 --> 01:02:34,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan got us our Halo 3 for free and a bunch of other stuff.

901
01:02:34,628 --> 01:02:46,413
[SPEAKER_03]: The last free one I can remember getting was a Midway rep I met at a show was kind enough to give me one of those arcade classics, which was great for me because I loved that shit, those 80 games, so that was cool, but that was a long time ago.

902
01:02:46,853 --> 01:02:47,814
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

903
01:02:48,074 --> 01:02:48,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Play Overlord.

904
01:02:49,154 --> 01:02:51,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks in chat are suggesting Gamefly.

905
01:02:51,235 --> 01:02:52,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I will play Overlord, I swear.

906
01:02:52,976 --> 01:02:56,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I will step away from Final Fantasy XI this week, the crack, the crack, and play some Overlord.

907
01:02:57,435 --> 01:03:00,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Skype line is still open if you want to give us a call.

908
01:03:00,578 --> 01:03:09,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a word of advice, call Echo123 before you call us on the Skype, and that way you can hear what you sound like, and you can hear if there's any echoing or any of that stuff.

909
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:15,634
[SPEAKER_03]: If your microphone is really close to your speakers, that's what causes the echo, so sorry, it's okay.

910
01:03:16,773 --> 01:03:18,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other last-minute stories real quick while we wait for some more calls?

911
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:19,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course I do.

912
01:03:20,436 --> 01:03:27,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, Attack of the Show is now in the Guinness Book of World Records for creating the largest arcade machine.

913
01:03:28,243 --> 01:03:36,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It is 1,300 pounds, has 150 arcade games built into it, it's 14 feet tall, and has a 75-inch screen.

914
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, it requires quarters that are 3 inches big.

915
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:41,273
[SPEAKER_03]: They like big things on that program, don't they?

916
01:03:41,293 --> 01:03:43,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they made a big Nintendo once, didn't they?

917
01:03:43,174 --> 01:03:44,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that at 1E3.

918
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:45,195
[SPEAKER_03]: They had that out there.

919
01:03:45,215 --> 01:03:47,116
[SPEAKER_03]: When I become rich, I will one-up everything they do.

920
01:03:47,336 --> 01:03:48,377
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to the phones.

921
01:03:48,397 --> 01:03:48,997
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another call.

922
01:03:49,257 --> 01:03:50,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

923
01:03:50,378 --> 01:03:50,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

924
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:52,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

925
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:53,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, who is this?

926
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

927
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,801
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Marissa.

928
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:59,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa!

929
01:03:59,263 --> 01:04:00,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa?

930
01:04:00,624 --> 01:04:01,364
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

931
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:03,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just calling to say hello.

932
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:06,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so nice to be able to hear the show this evening.

933
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:09,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's very random that you're listening to us live.

934
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:09,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it.

935
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:11,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it's very random that you're listening to us live.

936
01:04:11,606 --> 01:04:12,026
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it.

937
01:04:13,107 --> 01:04:14,148
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very cool, yeah.

938
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:18,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually finally came across this thing known as a computer, and I purchased one.

939
01:04:19,633 --> 01:04:23,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I had been out of one for about a year because I just didn't have the money, but now I'm back.

940
01:04:23,296 --> 01:04:28,941
[SPEAKER_06]: But I unfortunately have Windows Vista on a budget laptop, so I'm kind of screwed game-wise.

941
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:30,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

942
01:04:30,697 --> 01:04:36,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, since you have a new computer, has your gaming on the PC consisted of Solitaire and Minesweeper?

943
01:04:36,641 --> 01:04:37,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, since she's on Vista.

944
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:44,585
[SPEAKER_06]: With what bloatware Vista is, yeah, because it eats all my memory.

945
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:54,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I was lucky enough, I went to Target before going to Seattle to try to get some games because I took a train trip to Seattle.

946
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:57,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I wanted to have something to pass the time because it's like 38 hours.

947
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:00,356
[SPEAKER_06]: and I got King's Quest.

948
01:05:02,057 --> 01:05:02,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome!

949
01:05:02,697 --> 01:05:03,737
[SPEAKER_03]: King's Quest is the shit.

950
01:05:03,757 --> 01:05:05,118
[SPEAKER_06]: They re-released all of them.

951
01:05:07,058 --> 01:05:14,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be compatible with Windows 2000 but it doesn't work for Vista very well but oh well, that was cool.

952
01:05:15,641 --> 01:05:18,402
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks because the King's Quest series was amazing.

953
01:05:18,602 --> 01:05:21,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved those games when I was younger, especially King's Quest 4.

954
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:23,503
[SPEAKER_03]: That was always my favorite because it was based on the fairy tales.

955
01:05:24,693 --> 01:05:25,655
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

956
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:33,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very cool.

957
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:34,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

958
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:39,813
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really cool, but I don't like these episodic games because I don't like paying $20 for like half an hour worth of game.

959
01:05:40,093 --> 01:05:40,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

960
01:05:40,513 --> 01:05:47,157
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to get GameTap because not only are all the King's Quest games available on there, but they also have the Sam & Max.

961
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:50,599
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only bummer is you have to have an internet connection, so it's not so great for the train.

962
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:54,341
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can play for like $9.85 a month all the new Sam & Max games.

963
01:05:54,481 --> 01:05:55,541
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I sound like a commercial.

964
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:56,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wouldn't...

965
01:05:57,182 --> 01:05:57,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sweet.

966
01:05:57,382 --> 01:05:57,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Old stuff for me.

967
01:05:57,763 --> 01:05:59,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, the dude bought an Xbox.

968
01:05:59,084 --> 01:05:59,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

969
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:27,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so now I spend my evenings falling asleep in front of the TV while he plays Medal of Honor.

970
01:06:28,507 --> 01:06:29,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

971
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:29,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

972
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:31,750
[SPEAKER_10]: He dates up at 360, right?

973
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:33,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

974
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:38,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to talk to you later to get his gamer tag, and I'll give you Dan's and mine.

975
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:39,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, quite simple.

976
01:06:39,856 --> 01:06:40,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Long hair, Chris.

977
01:06:40,937 --> 01:06:41,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Long hair, Chris.

978
01:06:41,878 --> 01:06:43,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that makes... My boyfriend, there you go.

979
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: You do know, like, thousands of people that hear our show just heard that, right?

980
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get some more friend requests this week, you'll know why.

981
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:58,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, I'll go ahead and put Dan's on there, except I can't remember if it's with an underscore or not, but it would be Gunstar Hero.

982
01:06:59,443 --> 01:06:59,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

983
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:04,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'll let you know for sure later, and mine I never use, so I'll let you know later.

984
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:08,906
[SPEAKER_10]: But if he's got Halo 3, he should totally play with Dan so I can see Dan get punked.

985
01:07:09,186 --> 01:07:09,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's all play Uno.

986
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:10,947
[SPEAKER_06]: He's waiting for that, yeah.

987
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:14,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to talk him into getting the orange box, because I really want to play Portal.

988
01:07:14,688 --> 01:07:15,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

989
01:07:15,428 --> 01:07:16,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to stop singing the song.

990
01:07:17,988 --> 01:07:18,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't this song great?

991
01:07:19,229 --> 01:07:23,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I didn't get it at first, and it was when I finally saw it that I was like, this is the best song ever.

992
01:07:24,552 --> 01:07:28,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, Jamie was, I remember when that song was in the cage match, and Jamie was like, this song is stupid.

993
01:07:28,694 --> 01:07:29,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people love this song?

994
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:42,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, I said as a song without a frame of reference, it wasn't a very good song, but now that I have the frame, now that I logged into that stupid site and took the quiz that was on it, the personality thing, I was like, holy crap, this is messed up.

995
01:07:42,882 --> 01:07:43,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

996
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:46,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think that's why it is so cool.

997
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:52,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, it does bring a different dimension of weird when your co-worker is singing it in high-pitched falsetto while you're on the phone with a client.

998
01:07:52,853 --> 01:07:53,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool.

999
01:07:54,014 --> 01:07:54,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1000
01:07:55,175 --> 01:07:56,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Marissa... I'll let you guys go.

1001
01:07:56,616 --> 01:07:57,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great catching up.

1002
01:07:57,497 --> 01:08:00,539
[SPEAKER_03]: But please, please log into Xbox Live sometime and we'll play Uno.

1003
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sweet.

1004
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll hook up my webcam and play Strip Uno.

1005
01:08:04,662 --> 01:08:05,183
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just kidding.

1006
01:08:05,203 --> 01:08:05,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1007
01:08:06,386 --> 01:08:08,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have an Amazon wish list ready?

1008
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:11,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait.

1009
01:08:12,451 --> 01:08:12,911
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1010
01:08:12,951 --> 01:08:13,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, baby.

1011
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:15,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa, thanks so much for calling.

1012
01:08:16,113 --> 01:08:16,574
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you.

1013
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:17,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Marissa.

1014
01:08:17,074 --> 01:08:18,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back and be in the studio soon, okay?

1015
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:20,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, bye.

1016
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:20,877
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, bye.

1017
01:08:21,937 --> 01:08:24,359
[SPEAKER_03]: She has to come back soon so we can hear more stories about the Wunderbra.

1018
01:08:27,702 --> 01:08:29,443
[SPEAKER_10]: That was it.

1019
01:08:29,863 --> 01:08:30,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was the Wunderbra.

1020
01:08:33,854 --> 01:08:34,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1021
01:08:34,214 --> 01:08:35,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, more last minute stories.

1022
01:08:35,634 --> 01:08:37,975
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take one more call if anybody calls in.

1023
01:08:37,995 --> 01:08:40,276
[SPEAKER_03]: 877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1024
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:45,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there's apparently a new Bioshock achievement that someone spotted on live.

1025
01:08:47,417 --> 01:08:56,340
[SPEAKER_04]: The rumor is the 51st achievement, which is actually on the list there, is 100 points and it is from, it's called Bulletproof.

1026
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Complete the game on hard difficulty without using a Vita chamber.

1027
01:09:00,781 --> 01:09:01,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um,

1028
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:05,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Be interesting to see if this actually surfaces maybe in a new update or something like that.

1029
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, let's see here.

1030
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:14,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Benjo Kazooie 3, not coming out on 360 anymore.

1031
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:16,001
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been axed.

1032
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:17,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hooray.

1033
01:09:17,902 --> 01:09:24,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, there was something about, I saw on Twitter that there was going to be big news coming out about a 360 exclusive being axed.

1034
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: This must be it.

1035
01:09:25,463 --> 01:09:26,443
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be the one, I think.

1036
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:27,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.

1037
01:09:27,683 --> 01:09:28,884
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're getting one more call.

1038
01:09:29,464 --> 01:09:30,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it went away.

1039
01:09:30,564 --> 01:09:30,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

1040
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:35,138
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing to kind of go back to the MAME cabinet we were talking about earlier.

1041
01:09:35,459 --> 01:09:39,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamerator, it brings together MAME and beer.

1042
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:42,243
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beer tap in a MAME cabinet.

1043
01:09:42,544 --> 01:09:42,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold that thought.

1044
01:09:42,964 --> 01:09:43,824
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a call coming in.

1045
01:09:43,864 --> 01:09:48,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to hear more about the beer thing, but this is a conference call, so I'm always worried about these calls.

1046
01:09:48,207 --> 01:09:49,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lens Radio.

1047
01:09:49,148 --> 01:09:49,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1048
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:51,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Tech and Game Podcast.

1049
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,391
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bucket, Tokis, and Raven's Dolphin.

1050
01:09:53,431 --> 01:09:54,191
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, you guys?

1051
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:55,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much.

1052
01:09:55,652 --> 01:09:56,893
[SPEAKER_05]: You were talking about Sam and Max?

1053
01:09:57,254 --> 01:09:57,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1054
01:09:58,855 --> 01:10:00,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Our last caller, Marissa, is a Sam and Max fan.

1055
01:10:01,957 --> 01:10:02,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I am huge.

1056
01:10:02,637 --> 01:10:06,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I beat the new one today, and oh my god, it's awesome.

1057
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it?

1058
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,061
[SPEAKER_03]: About how long of gaming was it?

1059
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:13,203
[SPEAKER_05]: About five hours, but they really changed up some things about it.

1060
01:10:13,303 --> 01:10:18,146
[SPEAKER_05]: They added Stinky's Tavern as a restaurant, 50s theme.

1061
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:18,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nice.

1062
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:21,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love it.

1063
01:10:21,768 --> 01:10:22,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa goes nuts.

1064
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:24,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't go wrong with that.

1065
01:10:24,549 --> 01:10:26,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of funny stuff goes great.

1066
01:10:27,671 --> 01:10:31,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this taking a lot of time on your show recently, the Sam & Max series?

1067
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,183
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Call of Duty.

1068
01:10:34,184 --> 01:10:34,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Call of Duty.

1069
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:36,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's cool.

1070
01:10:36,205 --> 01:10:37,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam & Max is a good franchise.

1071
01:10:37,646 --> 01:10:41,870
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those ones I need to spend more time with, but those damn MMOs, you know how it goes.

1072
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:47,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this one has a hint feature, so it's much easier for the noobs to get in.

1073
01:10:49,676 --> 01:10:56,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa in our chat room actually follows up and says, Sam & Max rules, but Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis is still number one in my heart.

1074
01:10:57,602 --> 01:10:58,283
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Loom?

1075
01:10:58,443 --> 01:10:59,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the love for Loom?

1076
01:10:59,764 --> 01:11:00,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Loom is great.

1077
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,340
[SPEAKER_03]: is awesome.

1078
01:11:03,501 --> 01:11:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what else did you guys want to share with us?

1079
01:11:05,122 --> 01:11:05,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

1080
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Overlords on GameTap.

1081
01:11:07,303 --> 01:11:08,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Download it from there.

1082
01:11:08,624 --> 01:11:12,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a copy on Xbox 360 and that way I can get achievement points because I'm a whore for achievement points.

1083
01:11:12,886 --> 01:11:13,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, you're right.

1084
01:11:13,506 --> 01:11:13,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1085
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I can play Jericho or something on GameTap.

1086
01:11:16,388 --> 01:11:16,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, Jericho.

1087
01:11:16,968 --> 01:11:17,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't Jericho suck?

1088
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:21,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've heard that but I want to see that first hand if it does suck.

1089
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, because that's what everyone's said to me.

1090
01:11:23,232 --> 01:11:24,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Big disappointment.

1091
01:11:24,412 --> 01:11:24,792
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.

1092
01:11:24,812 --> 01:11:25,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay away.

1093
01:11:25,093 --> 01:11:27,074
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I keep hearing but I like to see these things first hand.

1094
01:11:27,154 --> 01:11:31,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you what kind of cool zombie game I've been playing on GameTap is Typing of the Dead.

1095
01:11:32,232 --> 01:11:33,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's awesome.

1096
01:11:33,072 --> 01:11:34,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing that a little.

1097
01:11:34,653 --> 01:11:37,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a steep learning curve to get all those letters in.

1098
01:11:37,954 --> 01:11:38,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I can type uber fast.

1099
01:11:39,014 --> 01:11:40,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe because you can't type, Raven.

1100
01:11:41,915 --> 01:11:44,536
[SPEAKER_03]: You type with two fingers, Raven, you're not going to get very far doing that.

1101
01:11:45,036 --> 01:11:45,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're right.

1102
01:11:46,897 --> 01:11:49,278
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, kids, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show.

1103
01:11:49,358 --> 01:11:50,338
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks so much for calling.

1104
01:11:50,358 --> 01:11:50,798
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

1105
01:11:51,018 --> 01:11:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for taking our call.

1106
01:11:51,918 --> 01:11:52,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

1107
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:53,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, you guys.

1108
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:54,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun with your show.

1109
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:56,500
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1110
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Raven and DeBucket from Tekken Games.

1111
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:02,120
[SPEAKER_03]: which I think is beating us on Op 11 still.

1112
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:03,420
[SPEAKER_03]: You go, boys.

1113
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,080
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, any other last-minute stories?

1114
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,621
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking about the beer and MAME machine.

1115
01:12:06,881 --> 01:12:07,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1116
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:08,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Skype line is now closed, kids.

1117
01:12:08,622 --> 01:12:10,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to those who didn't get through.

1118
01:12:10,322 --> 01:12:11,042
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gamerator.

1119
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:18,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $2,000, but it's a custom-built MAME cabinet, and it comes preloaded, of course, with 180 games.

1120
01:12:18,504 --> 01:12:20,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, it's got internal AV hookups.

1121
01:12:21,285 --> 01:12:23,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It lets you throw your PC or console in there as well.

1122
01:12:24,893 --> 01:12:50,682
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course it comes doubles as a keg it's got tap and everything so that's awesome beer and maim together another interesting thing I guess there is a sequel to Dig Dug 2 coming I guess it's called Dig Dug Islands it's actually being Namco Bandai has partnered with Verx to produce it as an online PC game

1123
01:12:51,812 --> 01:12:54,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're interested in more Dig Dug, there you go.

1124
01:12:57,115 --> 01:12:58,976
[SPEAKER_04]: There already was like a Dig Dug 1.5 on DS.

1125
01:12:58,996 --> 01:12:59,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it.

1126
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:03,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Dig Dug DS.

1127
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:04,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it.

1128
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:16,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, Nexen, of course that South Korean company doing a lot of MMOs and stuff, they're developing a couple games for, well, one for the Xbox 360 and one for the DS.

1129
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:17,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1130
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:21,441
[SPEAKER_04]: MapleStory is coming to the DS, so that's one that's being worked on right now.

1131
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:26,544
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one is an MMO called Mabinogi, and that's coming to the 360.

1132
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:35,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess Mabinogi is a cel-shaded MMO that looks interesting.

1133
01:13:35,288 --> 01:13:40,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And then MapleStory, I think a lot of people are familiar with MapleStory, so for the DS that would be pretty cool.

1134
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:46,494
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I guess Live is doing something for their 5th anniversary starting November 15th.

1135
01:13:47,662 --> 01:13:49,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of parties online.

1136
01:13:49,503 --> 01:13:50,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Uno for everybody.

1137
01:13:50,543 --> 01:13:52,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, that's interesting because that's starting on Wednesday.

1138
01:13:52,924 --> 01:13:56,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they got any really kick-ass Xbox Live Arcade games for that day.

1139
01:13:58,266 --> 01:13:59,986
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't said what's coming out this week, have they?

1140
01:14:00,166 --> 01:14:00,726
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet.

1141
01:14:01,026 --> 01:14:02,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're sitting on something good.

1142
01:14:02,607 --> 01:14:05,568
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some really highly anticipated games we haven't got yet?

1143
01:14:05,628 --> 01:14:05,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Rez?

1144
01:14:06,128 --> 01:14:07,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Rez would be fucking awesome.

1145
01:14:07,429 --> 01:14:08,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's true.

1146
01:14:08,129 --> 01:14:08,629
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be that.

1147
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:11,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1148
01:14:12,032 --> 01:14:13,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the hella famous shooter.

1149
01:14:13,852 --> 01:14:14,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Omega 5?

1150
01:14:14,152 --> 01:14:14,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Treasure.

1151
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:15,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Omega 5?

1152
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:16,853
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the one that's called... Ikaruga?

1153
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:17,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Radiant Silver Gun.

1154
01:14:18,574 --> 01:14:19,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Ikaruga is the one that, yeah.

1155
01:14:20,955 --> 01:14:23,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But Omega 5, they've been pimping that out for a while now.

1156
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:25,036
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1157
01:14:25,056 --> 01:14:25,496
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be kind of cool.

1158
01:14:25,636 --> 01:14:27,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the party starts on Microsoft this week.

1159
01:14:27,137 --> 01:14:28,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Screwjumper was coming out.

1160
01:14:28,717 --> 01:14:29,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that already come out?

1161
01:14:29,638 --> 01:14:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Screwjumper?

1162
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:33,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think they have confirmed that is this week's title, Screwjumper.

1163
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:34,579
[SPEAKER_03]: But there could be a second one that's really cool.

1164
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:35,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there could be a second one.

1165
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Screwjumper looks stupid.

1166
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be okay.

1167
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:39,081
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be okay.

1168
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:48,608
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, thank you as always for blessing us with your presence.

1169
01:14:48,848 --> 01:14:49,508
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your final thought?

1170
01:14:50,468 --> 01:14:55,169
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I can't find where I can save this wallpaper to so that I can make it fit my desktop.

1171
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:58,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll thank myself for blessing the show with my presence.

1172
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:03,892
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought is I want enchiladas really bad because looking at this Aldo Berritos mug makes me crave horchatas.

1173
01:15:04,932 --> 01:15:06,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, thank you as always for being here.

1174
01:15:06,993 --> 01:15:08,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's your final thought?

1175
01:15:08,632 --> 01:15:09,413
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN is still doing the insanest hour

1176
01:15:35,345 --> 01:15:40,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And Saturday, I believe Travis Donovan is back up and running after a little bit of a summer hiatus.

1177
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he had a show this week.

1178
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:46,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully by the new year, we'll be up and running with lots of shows.

1179
01:15:46,435 --> 01:15:48,637
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in talks to do some stuff.

1180
01:15:48,697 --> 01:15:51,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get back to you with that.

1181
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:56,725
[SPEAKER_10]: And just also the FYI, next week, week after, I will not be here.

1182
01:15:57,506 --> 01:15:58,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Cry.

1183
01:15:58,386 --> 01:15:59,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And the week after that.

1184
01:15:59,383 --> 01:16:00,183
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1185
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,010
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we'll see.

1186
01:16:26,610 --> 01:16:27,331
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't decided yet.

1187
01:16:27,351 --> 01:16:27,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1188
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:28,531
[SPEAKER_03]: We could use a break, though.

1189
01:16:28,551 --> 01:16:34,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that time during Thanksgiving to travel somewhere, so I kind of want to go back to Magic Mountain.

1190
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:34,734
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1191
01:16:34,754 --> 01:16:35,854
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to find somebody to go with me, though.

1192
01:16:36,474 --> 01:16:37,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully he hasn't burned down yet.

1193
01:16:38,215 --> 01:16:38,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope not.

1194
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:39,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope not.

1195
01:16:40,076 --> 01:16:41,256
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, that's it.

1196
01:16:41,796 --> 01:16:45,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio.

1197
01:16:45,778 --> 01:16:46,658
[SPEAKER_03]: We've said that a lot tonight.

1198
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:53,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, if you guys like what you hear, or even if you don't like what you hear, please still help us out by telling two people you know

1199
01:16:53,806 --> 01:16:54,527
[SPEAKER_03]: about the program.

1200
01:16:54,547 --> 01:16:57,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can't think of anybody to tell, then spread the word on the internet.

1201
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:05,876
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that through iTunes by leaving us a positive review or one of those many, many sites like Podcast Alley, I don't know, Yahoo Podcast, Dig, whatever the hell.

1202
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Just help us spread the word.

1203
01:17:07,637 --> 01:17:08,498
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

1204
01:17:08,518 --> 01:17:09,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are awesome.

1205
01:17:09,899 --> 01:17:13,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.

1206
01:17:13,802 --> 01:17:14,483
[SPEAKER_03]: That is Loki.

1207
01:17:14,743 --> 01:17:15,764
[SPEAKER_03]: She is Dark Sakura.

1208
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:18,766
[SPEAKER_03]: And together, we are... Are not Captain Planet.

1209
01:17:19,587 --> 01:17:20,788
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we are not Captain Planet.

1210
01:17:22,145 --> 01:17:25,208
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are Orange Lounge Radio, so take care and we'll see you next week.
