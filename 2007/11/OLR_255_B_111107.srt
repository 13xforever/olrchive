Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live on this Sunday evening, November the 11th of 2007.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Remember, we are released in two parts every week.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So if you missed part A, you can go check it out on our podcast feed in the archives.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Or, of course, there's always our live webcam feed on Operator 11.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Visit www.operator11.com.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And sometimes we do some other little bonus shows, too.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In fact, we're going to be showing off a new game tonight after the show.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So check our Operator 11 archives for that.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some gaming news.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And Loki is going to start us off.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Anyways, some fun stuff, of course. We got to check this out a little bit during the break here.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But the Check Me Out channel has finally been released on the Wii.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So you can go download it now from the Wii shop there.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And, of course, it's actually pretty cool.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They have a bunch of different things you can do in there.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can browse the top voted... I guess it's like Hot or Not for Miis.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can browse the top voted Miis in there.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can check out some random ones, download the ones you like, which is pretty cool.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Post the ones you think are cool.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Other people will rate them.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Then they have themed contests.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The one going on right now is Design a Mi that looks like Mario without his hat.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Which I've seen a Mi like that.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think it's on my list. I should just submit that.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I should totally plagiarize. No, I won't do that.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, I think if they have the person's name on it, though, it's going to credit them.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So it's not going to say you did it.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But that's basically what it is.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And it's pretty cool looking.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, kind of interesting. We tape live on Sundays.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And literally, during the break between part A and B,

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
because we take about a 10-15 minute break between the two parts when we're taping live,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
is when the message came on the Wii that the channel was up.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, Loki and I briefly looked for like five minutes of the new channel during the break.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And some pretty interesting Miis in there.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I like there was like a Jordy LaForge Mi that was in there.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Somebody had created a little miniature picture of like a penguin on somebody's face.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Like I thought that was really good skills.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They have some pretty cool Miis on there.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know if I could post some of the ones I've made, though.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, you might get rejected.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What happens if you send penis head in? That might get rejected.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That would not be good.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Very cool. So for those of you guys listening live,

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
for those of you in our chat room and listening live to us on Sunday,

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
go check that out if you have a Wii. It's up now.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And you can look at some Miis.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I was just looking at random Miis, and some of them are interesting.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But I thought what was interesting is that one of the Miis that came in the random pool,

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
because you could put just pool random 50 Miis,

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
was exactly like a Mi one of my friends had created on my machine.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It was the exact same thing, but it was somebody else's name.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm wearing a different color. It was so weird.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So weird.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I guess certain faces are still popular. I don't know.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But anyway, the Check Me Out channel is available right now.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And by the time most of you guys hear this, it will have been out for actually quite some time.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Something moving on, speaking about the Wii.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The Wii has been rumored earlier this week based on a comment from Reggie Fils-Aime

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to have 200 virtual console games by the year's end.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And people were kind of freaking out, like, wait a minute.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In order for the Wii to have that many games by the year's end,

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
they're going to have to really step up their production

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
by putting out like four and a half games a week.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Four to five games every week.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sorry, this week you're going to get the first half of...

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Some of those old games they put out should only count as half a game, honestly.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But Nintendo put out an official statement that Reggie was only approximating,

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
that there's not actually going to be 200 virtual console games by the year's end.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But there will be about 180 if they keep up their current output.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So there you have it.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Lots and lots of stuff to check out, the old school stuff.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
However, I would like to point out we are, what, 160 games in so far,

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and still no guardian legend.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This makes me a sad panda.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That is sad.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It is a crime.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Awful.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So I don't know what rights you have to get,

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
but you better get those really quick.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So that's all I have to say about the virtual console.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, for our friends in the UK,

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Super Mario Brothers 3 is heading to virtual console.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Actually, we are getting it on Monday.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Is that correct?

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We got it this Monday.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, we already...

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This Monday.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And it's going to be 500 Wii points.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Also coming out is Blue's Journey for the Neo Geo,

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and that will be 900.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And also Power Golf for Turbo Graphics 16 for 600 points.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, I'm glad to see that Super Mario Brothers 3

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
is making the rounds worldwide, because it is a great game.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It is one of the all-time great NES classics,

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
so everybody gets to enjoy it now.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hooray.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yay.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Anyways.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So apparently some best buys have been breaking the street

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
on Super Mario Galaxy and settling it early.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Shame on them.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And apparently a few people have been buying

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
according to the Games Facts forum thread, I guess.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They have pictures online, including stuff.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But hey, you only have to wait a couple more days to play it,

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
so hooray.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Now, if they had Super Smash Brothers,

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that would be a feat.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I somehow don't think they can get that right now.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
AZHP is in our chat room and is bragging,

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I got a copy.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So apparently somehow some folks were able to get one

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
from Best Buy, so good job to those folks.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Moving on.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Speaking of Super Mario Galaxy, right now,

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
right this very minute, there is an event going on

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
at the Nintendo World Store in New York City.

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It is the Mario Galaxy Launch Party.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's going on right now.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think it started at 8 p.m. is when it started.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But it's only been going until 10 p.m.,

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
so I guess it is going to end pretty soon here,

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and then it's going to reopen again at midnight.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I guess the game officially goes on sale at midnight tonight.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So the whole thing is going on right now.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And apparently they've had a DJ, dancers, a Velcro wall,

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
a bungee run, trivia contest,

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and a laser light show inside the building.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And apparently Mario himself, or at least a fat guy

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
in a Mario outfit, is there as well.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
250 Wii systems also on sale at the Nintendo World Store.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And actually one of our listeners is there live

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and is supposed to be calling us any minute now

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
with a call, a report from there,

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
so we might have to interrupt.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, here we go.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I think this is the call coming in right now.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Who's this?

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hi, this is Zaku.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, Zaku, how are you doing?

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm just here in the rock right here

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
just seeing Mario Galaxy on screen

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and people just going after T-shirts

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and just freaking my ass off.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, yeah, that's pretty much it.

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What the hell's going on?

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I mean, there's almost black right now.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What the hell have they been doing there tonight, Zaku?

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They've had a Velcro wall?

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Large party.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They have a live T-shirt right now.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They're giving out free shit.

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There's people waiting in line for the launch,

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and I know one of them is the one that actually got

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the first Wii in this country last year

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
in front of us in Times Square.

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That same guy.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Wow.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That same guy with the power glove on his right hand.

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's some hard...

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He's up on the line like one of the first two.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There's some hardcore people out there right now.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, I can't hear that much right now.

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I was just going to say, it sounds like there's some hardcore people there.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There's like a few dozen people.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But there's like, let me see,

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I count maybe 50 or 70,

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
or like 60 people just waiting in line right now.

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So tell us more about...

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I've seen beyond the store and into the other buildings.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Tell us more about the special events that are going on.

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Have you actually been able to get your hands on the game yet?

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes, I played it.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They had like three guys with monitors

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
basically sticking out from like a rod

183
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
or something that they're carrying on their back with the game.

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Kind of like how they did it last year with the segway.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You know, the Wii hooked up to the segway,

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
now they're basically walking.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They're carrying all that gear, walking the game,

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
you know, bringing the game to you by foot.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Wow.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Our chat room is just pretty excited to be hearing

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the actual live report from the show going on right now.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
In fact, Frisbee in our chat room says,

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
this is the first time I've heard Zaku call in and not sound sleepy.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you definitely are excited to be there, right?

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No.

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, come on.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I had to bust my ass in the cold.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What do you think?

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I pretty much kept going to get some coffee

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and taking a leak just to get this call through.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But yeah, so far it's been good.

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I mean, the game pretty much plays like Mario 64,

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
only with motion control and slightly better depth.

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Awesome.

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Well, can you give a shout out to the entire crowd

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
that Orange Launch Radio says hello?

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm outside of the crowd.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's pretty thick right there.

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's going to be hard to get inside there.

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Can you give a big shout out to everybody around you

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that Orange Launch Radio says hello?

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, man, random strangers just saying some crazy stuff.

213
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If I knew about this earlier, then I would have just done my whole body

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
with all our motion stuff.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's all good.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It would have put the website down.

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's all good.

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Zaku, thanks so much for the report and have fun at the event.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And don't go too crazy, okay?

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All right.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Take care, buddy.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Have a good one.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll see you guys later.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Later.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Poor guy.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's one of our infamous callers, the legend of Zaku,

228
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
calling us live from the Mario launch event

229
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
at the Nintendo World Headquarters in New York City.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Isn't that fun when we can do live reports like that?

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
More stuff needs to happen on Sunday nights when we can do that.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Good times.

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can definitely hear, like, in the background,

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
like there's tons of people there.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's amazing.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
All right.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, let's move on then with the news.

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Thank you, Zaku, again for that special report.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, in other news, and I think that this is pretty cool

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
because there are a lot of fans of this game.

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
For anyone with a PSP, Disgaea is heading out to PSP.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It will be called Afternoon of Darkness.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, so it's like a new game in the series.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Sounds like.

245
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Cool.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They're putting in a few specific things for the PSP,

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
like a multiplayer mode where you can go against your friends worldwide

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
or share items from your shop.

249
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It has an exclusive storyline,

250
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and you're trying to become the beauty queen ultimate overlord.

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Isn't that your goal in real life, Dark Sakura,

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to become the beauty queen overlord?

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No, my goal is just to be the overlord.

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I see.

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I know a lot of people really love Disgaea for its quirky sense of humor,

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and I played it once.

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's fun.

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I need to sit down and spend more time with it

259
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
if I could ever tear myself away from those damn MMOs.

260
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, if you're in the U.S.,

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you're in luck because it came out a couple weeks ago.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Sweet.

263
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Definitely worth picking up if you like Disgaea.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So it's very typical that the Brits are getting in a couple weeks behind.

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Sorry, guys.

266
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We still love you.

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
PSP is a region free,

268
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
so if you really, really, really, really, really need your Disgaea right away,

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
then there you go.

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Anyways, not the big surprise,

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but Sony has released a custom theme maker for the PlayStation 3,

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
much like they did with the PSP after they had theme support for that.

273
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Of course, with the new firmware 2.0 allowing themes,

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
you can now create your own.

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So yes, as soon as I get around to it,

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I will create new themes for the PSP website,

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and I'll also create a theme for the PlayStation 3 as well.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's about time.

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Sheesh.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, whatever.

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm too busy playing stuff.

282
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I just renewed the domain not that long ago,

283
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and I seriously considered just letting it expire,

284
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
but then I remember that there were some people that were e-mailing us

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
saying, I listen to you on the PSP,

286
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and so I figured, all right, for them we'll keep the site up.

287
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was a really well done website.

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You don't see many PSP custom done websites.

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I did not renew the domain for OLRE

290
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
since I never made a site for that.

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Damn you.

292
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Whatever.

293
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Who cares?

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let me forgive you.

295
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, also on the PlayStation 3, apparently,

296
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
if you had your firmware before version 2.0,

297
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
you usually only used to be able to see videos

298
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
if it was supported in PlayStation 3's format.

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, now after the 2.0 patch, apparently,

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the PlayStation 3 will now show you thumbnails,

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
running times, and file names for other supported,

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
other non-supported formats, such as XVID and DivX.

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Now, you can't play them.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can just see them,

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
but certainly people are taking that one step further and saying,

306
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
well, this is a sign that you're actually going to have support for DivX

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and XVID in the near future on the PlayStation 3,

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
which would certainly be a welcome addition.

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah.

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But for right now, you only get thumbnails,

311
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and you get to know they're there.

312
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's just that it will say, you can't watch me,

313
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

314
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So there you have it.

315
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, poor baby.

316
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, so it's about, you know,

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
we've had this going on for years and years and years and years, you know.

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
They have a preliminary settlement for the class action suit

319
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
against Take-Two Interactive for the hot coffee.

320
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, boy.

321
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, my God, this is years old.

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah.

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So basically the terms of the settlement,

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the ones who can benefit from that,

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
as if they bought a copy of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
before July 20th, 2005.

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
B, were offended by the game's content

328
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
that used the hot coffee modification.

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That means they would have had, I take...

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I was offended that I had to unlock it.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I think, no, they said they were upset by the ability

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to modify and alter the game.

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Well, I was upset that you had to have an ability to do it

334
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and it wasn't just there.

335
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So can I have money?

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And that they would not have bought the game

337
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
had they known the ability was there

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and would have returned the game

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
upon learning that the game could be modified

340
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
if they thought possible.

341
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So they have to be able to prove all of this

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and exchange their copy for a cash settlement

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
of up to $35 with their proof of purchase.

344
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Wow.

345
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So the...

346
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There's still more money than GameStop will give you for it,

347
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
so hey.

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Pretty much.

349
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Take-Two is committed to spend 1.025 million

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
on the settlement benefits

351
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
and their out-of-pocket cost total is 2.75 million.

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So now you can...

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And paying the court cost.

354
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Now, Pete Caruno in our chatroom says,

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can get free money if I say I'm offended by something?

356
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm in.

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You have to have your proof of purchase.

358
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You have to have the proof of purchase.

359
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Who the hell has a proof of purchase that late?

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I know.

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, that's how they get around it, you know.

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I'm going to save it for granted without a fork

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
because I'm going to be highly offended by that someday.

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I want to see how many people actually have it.

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Highly offended that I didn't get my $35 sooner.

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
There's a statement, by the way.

367
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, yes?

368
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
From Ben Fetter, who's the CEO of Take-Two.

369
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If the case had continued,

370
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
we believe the court would have agreed that Take-Two

371
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
was not liable for consumers acting independently

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to modify their games with third-party hardware and software

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
to access normally inaccessible content.

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Nonetheless, we believe it is in the best interest of the company

375
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
to avoid protracted and costly litigation to prove our case

376
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and to finally put this matter behind us.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Gerardimo says, I'm offended by your offense.

378
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
ActDeft, our listener from Mexico who's listening,

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
says, I'm suing the guys that made the Spanish training game.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm offended and I need money.

381
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Spanish for everyone.

382
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Awesome.

383
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Wow.

384
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, I don't know.

385
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I would like to see if they're going to release figures

386
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
on exactly how many people actually went and got money over this.

387
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'd be kind of curious to see how many people actually had the proof of purchases

388
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and actually went through the song and dance to do this.

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think that would be kind of an interesting figure.

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I bet it's less than a couple thousand, if that, honestly.

391
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I mean, how many people are going to think to do this?

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Most parents were pissed off and they moved on, right?

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Well, you know, there's going to be letters that go out to anyone involved

394
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
that put their name in with the lawsuit.

395
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I guess that's true.

396
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Anyways, so there's an interesting drama going on on the website The Consumerist.

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Apparently, a PS3 owner had a problem with their PS3 not working,

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
so they sent it in to be repaired and I guess, according to them,

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
it was too dusty to be fixed and they considered that because of the dust,

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
it was not covered under the warranty.

401
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Uh-oh, my Wii is going to be out of warranty as well then

402
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
with a thick layer of dust on that thing because Mario Galaxy is not out yet.

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
They said that it was an act of God or customer abuse.

404
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That would be under...

405
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But it's funny though because there was a follow-up to this as well.

406
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
God has smited my PlayStation 3 with a thick layer of dust.

407
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The horror, the horror.

408
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But there was also a follow-up to that.

409
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I remember reading that that whole statement, of course, is not really true.

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes, Sony does. Dust does not void your warranty as well,

411
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
but that was in the later follow-up, I guess.

412
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But this one lady that was adamant,

413
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
she said that she was the head of the customer service department

414
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
or something like that in any way that they called.

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, and then the other thing too is the guy said,

416
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
well then hell, take a picture of this dust

417
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and let me see what exactly you're talking about if it's so detrimental.

418
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And they said, oh no, we can't take any pictures of that

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
because all the pictures would be owned by Sony

420
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and then you can't see them without a subpoena or something like that.

421
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You have to pay under $50 to repair it out of warranty or something like that.

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Our chat room is lighting up with conversation here.

423
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Odd1 says, it was an act of shitty games.

424
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Frisbee says, God made dirt and dirt don't hurt.

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No, but basically, I was just going to read some sections of this here.

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The guy, I kept my 60-gig PS3 in an entertainment center since its purchase.

427
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It is known within the PS3 community that the thing is a huge dust magnet.

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I took good care of it.

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I have ten Blu-ray discs that did not come free of my PS3.

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Five games, five controllers.

431
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Why the fuck do you have five controllers?

432
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What the hell are you playing?

433
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Maybe specialty controller?

434
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
NBA Live, I'm guessing, because that game supports up to seven.

435
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Or not NBA Live, NBA 08 or whatever, or 07.

436
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, we get it.

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Two 42-inch LCD TVs, one 50-inch Bravia LCD rear production TV air,

438
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
something like that, via desktop, via laptop, blah, blah, blah.

439
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Anyways, one day I turn it on, I put a disc in, and it doesn't show up,

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and it won't eject.

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Finally, I get to eject, and I try to Blu-ray, and nothing.

442
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The CD is nothing.

443
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So I call customer support who originally told me they can't do anything

444
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
because I don't have the original sales receipt.

445
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It was a gift.

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I stayed on the phone for hours explaining to them that I have the receipt

447
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
or I don't have the receipt because it was a gift.

448
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Finally, the reps said that it was strange that the early reps hadn't let me

449
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
go through with the exchange.

450
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If it was a gift, it was a policy not to require receipt, blah, blah, blah.

451
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Anyways, five days later, I have no updates.

452
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Six hours later, after calling them again, I get a call from someone from Nell

453
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
saying, unfortunately, they have opened the case and taken pictures inside

454
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and outside the case, and it was too dirty to be eligible for replacement.

455
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room says, was the owner Pigpen from Peanuts?

456
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And Azurameh says, I hope I pronounced that right, says PlayStation 3 weakness

457
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
is dust, which makes me think of the end of signs.

458
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It was water that was their weak point the whole time.

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Now it's like dust.

460
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Anyway, he goes back and forth.

461
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The supervisor, who apparently was a bitch, named Daria Wu, extension 55682,

462
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
basically told him that the picture of the PSP was the property of Sony

463
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Computer Entertainment of America and that they would have to subpoena

464
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
pictures in order to see them, and blah, blah, blah.

465
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And then, of course, at the very end, he says, I don't get it, so I'm using

466
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
it to be folding at home with their consoles.

467
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The auto start feature makes it so that it's running almost all the time.

468
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Of course, it's going to be filled with dust.

469
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Few reps said the reason they couldn't replace it is because it looked like

470
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
it had been two years worth of dust rather than eight months.

471
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The console hasn't even been out for years, so obviously that's less than

472
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
a year's worth of dust.

473
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And, of course, he's all pissed off about it and wasn't going to stay quiet,

474
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
and that's why everybody ran it.

475
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And then, apparently, like I said, the follow-up, another consumer rep

476
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
reported, I'm calling pretty much to clarify the PS3's warranty.

477
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
If there's any clause in the warranty that makes it so that the PS3 is too

478
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
dusty, that the warranty is void.

479
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And the rep said, no, no, and no.

480
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The only way that it voided is if it were neglected, views dropped,

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
or anything like that, modification.

482
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Like, if you opened it up, if you don't have the sales receipt,

483
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
power failures, mother nature actually voids the warranty.

484
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Christ, there's a Bible written on this whole thing, isn't there?

485
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let me put it this way, why didn't they just fix it?

486
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I mean, seriously, their, I don't know, the fucking system obviously

487
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
hadn't been opened up.

488
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So what?

489
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's dusty.

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You're doing a horrible job of making it a dust magnet.

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
All right.

492
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, anyhow, I'm sure we're getting lots of colorful comments on that one.

493
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
If you have something to attribute, if your PlayStation 3 has died due to dust,

494
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
we'd love to hear from you.

495
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You know what?

496
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What?

497
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I think this is a job for dust cap, too.

498
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you'd like to send us an email.

499
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And Jamie will be opening up the mailbag very soon,

500
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
but we have one more story for you guys before we get to that point.

501
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And that would be about Warner Brothers.

502
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Warner Brothers has decided to purchase Traveler's Tales

503
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and the parent group TT Games.

504
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You might know Traveler's Tales from the Lego franchise as well.

505
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So Warner Brothers just wants to own that shit.

506
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So there you have it.

507
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
By the way, they'll be putting out Lego Batman very soon,

508
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
which looks kind of awesome because I love old school Batman.

509
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So there you have it.

510
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
All right.

511
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, like I said, every week you guys send us email to mailbag

512
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
at orangelaundry.com.

513
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And the one and only Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag,

514
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
dive on in and read her favorite emails

515
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and maybe some of the ones she didn't like either.

516
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Hopefully this is a good week.

517
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I don't know, Dark Sakura.

518
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Was it a good email week?

519
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
On a scale of 1 to 10, maybe a 6, a 7?

520
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
R.

521
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It was an R.

522
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Okay.

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Well, anyway, I don't know how that works,

524
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
but here goes Dark Sakura with this week's mail.

525
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

526
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The first email comes from Xenocore.

527
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Hey, folks.

528
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I recently acquired a copy of Oreno Rioni for a PS1.

529
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I love this game.

530
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
However, the emulators I have used with the game

531
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
don't give me precise control on all analog sticks.

532
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Do you know of the better method to play this game,

533
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
whether emulated or mod chip?

534
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I still have the initial launch PS2 and a 60-gigabyte PS3.

535
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What can I do?

536
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I love this game and can't wait to play it.

537
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Well, I'm not really the best person to tell you

538
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
because I actually have a Japanese PS2

539
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and I have several modified...

540
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, not really that they're modified,

541
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
but I have the PS1 before they removed the back port

542
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
so that you couldn't use the GameShark thing on it.

543
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So I really, from experience, could not tell you.

544
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What game?

545
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's Oreno Rioni.

546
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I had never even heard of that game, I'm sorry to say.

547
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So I know we love obscure titles, but...

548
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Dear Wikipedia.

549
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah.

550
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
No, not that one.

551
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You know, and I got to say, the PlayStation 1,

552
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
that was kind of the period of my life

553
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
where I wasn't gaming a whole lot.

554
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I played a lot of the big games,

555
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
like Final Fantasy VII and Infinity of the Night,

556
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
but I missed a lot of shit during that period

557
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
because that's when I was in college

558
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
and I was actually doing a little bit of work

559
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
here and there between Puzzle Fighter II.

560
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I was back in the day when I was purchasing

561
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
HK copies of games,

562
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
importing Ridge Racer 4 and shit like that.

563
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, even Google can't find this.

564
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'll leave it to the chat room to say something about it, though.

565
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The Flawless Bolt X says,

566
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Funny how someone mentions a PlayStation 1 game

567
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
when last episode Loki said no one plays them anymore.

568
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Hey, there's some irony.

569
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
In the U.S.

570
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Sorry we don't have much more for you, my friend.

571
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Hey, we're going to be playing Vibriven.

572
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
True.

573
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Right?

574
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Hey, but people that play PlayStation...

575
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Let me play it this way, though.

576
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
If you want to play a PlayStation 1 game right now,

577
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
you're probably either playing it on a PSP,

578
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
whether it be modded or not,

579
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
or, you know, you're probably playing it

580
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
on a PlayStation 1 that you already have.

581
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You know, I don't think people are out there.

582
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Maybe there's people out there

583
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
that want to play Final Fantasy VII

584
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
or something like that to try it out,

585
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
but I don't think there's actually people out there

586
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
that are like, you know what?

587
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I think I'm going to buy a brand new PlayStation 1

588
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and some PlayStation 1 games.

589
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You know, most people don't really go back that far.

590
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Sorry, we weren't much help on that one.

591
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We're not experts on everything.

592
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Just most things.

593
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But congratulations for stumping the host.

594
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Dude, I couldn't...

595
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Here's some free Rice-A-Roni.

596
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I couldn't find anything about that game.

597
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Anyway, we get an e-mail from Thomas that says

598
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
O-L-R equals win.

599
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Well, thank you, Thomas.

600
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And we get one from Robert N.

601
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It says, I'm not sure if tonight's show

602
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
includes plans on discussing the harmonics iPod game phase.

603
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Hey, you're psycho.

604
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I mean, psychic.

605
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Maybe psycho, too.

606
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Freudian slip.

607
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
How dare you insult the listeners.

608
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You know what, whatever.

609
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But I did go ahead and purchase that on iTunes Store.

610
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I have only two complaints,

611
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
which are issues with all iPods games so far.

612
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
First of all, it uses a lot of battery power while playing.

613
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Secondly, any session between syncing the iPod with your computer with iTunes

614
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
in which phase is played even once

615
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
appears to clear out your play counts for all podcasts and songs,

616
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
which isn't even an issue if you don't care about play counts,

617
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
but it could be problematic for podcasts.

618
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
It's playing phase to a podcast.

619
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Wow, that might be interesting.

620
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Or not.

621
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Otherwise, the game is a lot of fun, simple, but addictive.

622
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Most of it uses the back, select, and forward buttons

623
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
tapped to the beat of the music,

624
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
following on-screen scrolling options

625
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
with a great artistic style surrounding it.

626
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
A few parts use the scroll wheel to follow a line for bonus points,

627
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
which build up stars needed to pass checkpoints.

628
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It usually works equally as well with songs you add to the playlist in iTunes

629
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
as it does with its built-in songs,

630
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
including new songs by Freezepop, Ben Camaro, among others.

631
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Sweet.

632
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Highly recommended for fans of music games.

633
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Sounds kind of fun.

634
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I need to check that out still on my iPod, which I will at some point.

635
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I didn't realize it came with some free songs.

636
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That I did not know.

637
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Freezepop is cool.

638
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Very cool.

639
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
J-Rod.

640
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm just glad that we missed that concert last week.

641
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I bought my PS3 from Kmart,

642
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and now they stopped selling Blu-ray discs to those damn traders.

643
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
This is the person with the really cool signature

644
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
that says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden,

645
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
home of Never Ending Salads.

646
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And breadsticks.

647
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't forget breadsticks.

648
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I don't want any more salad.

649
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's going to be more salad for you.

650
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Oh, never mind.

651
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I was going to say something, but I lost.

652
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
My train derailed.

653
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
My train of thought.

654
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The salad destroyed your train.

655
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Because I started thinking about the Olive Garden,

656
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and the Olive Garden is awesome.

657
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, we have a long one.

658
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Hurray for long emails.

659
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It says this is actually being sent to us by,

660
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
well, if I just say Rick,

661
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
because he didn't put a nickname in there,

662
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
but it seems like he's from the UK.

663
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's cool.

664
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Hi, guys.

665
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Let me know if you get the reference.

666
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Okay.

667
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It started with GameSpot,

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and then it expanded to IGN.

669
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Then I found this link to OLR on a random podcast site.

670
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Now my crack-like habit of listening to gaming podcasts

671
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
creeps into my working day.

672
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Yours being the one I look forward to the most.

673
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Oh, thank you.

674
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh, thank you.

675
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Cheerio.

676
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Cheerio.

677
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Now as my girlfriend is sleeping,

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I must wait till tomorrow to download

679
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and heat up my OLR fix on the spoon,

680
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
then inject it into my ears while striving to work

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
or pretending to concentrate on my PC screen at my desk,

682
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
stifling a few good laughs, I might add.

683
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
This guy is hardcore.

684
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I love it.

685
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Rad.

686
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I own a Wii.

687
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now, I know it may not seem as a hardcore system,

688
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
but I love it.

689
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I have owned every incarnation of Nintendo's system

690
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
and enjoyed them all.

691
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yes, even the N64 Dark was cool apart from the last level.

692
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And I have never had a hardware failure with any of them

693
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
apart from when I made Smoke come out of the back

694
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
of my Super NES after playing Desert Strike for 24 hours solid.

695
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Wow.

696
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Hardcore.

697
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I don't know if I'd say hardcore more so fanboy.

698
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's all right.

699
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It's not a crime.

700
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I recently bought a nice 32-inch Panasonic LCD TV,

701
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and I was excited by the thought of mating my Wii

702
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
with my new tele.

703
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes, I'm from England.

704
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
See, I told you.

705
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
To make sweet love and produce a little bundle of gaming joy.

706
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
To my confusion, I seemed to have funny little dots

707
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
all over the screen.

708
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Then I played Resident Evil 4.

709
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I was horrified to see it looked like a crusty pile

710
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
of burst hemorrhoids.

711
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
That's beautiful.

712
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Ew.

713
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
After frantically searching the internet,

714
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I found that the problem was with the video card

715
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
on the Wii overheating.

716
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I rang the nice people in Nintendo and sent it away.

717
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And after two weeks, they returned it back to me all fixed.

718
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Now, I am happy to say it all looks fab.

719
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Is this a common fault?

720
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I have never heard any of this on any podcast before.

721
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The 360 has its own podcast named

722
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
after its notorious issues.

723
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Anyway, keep up the good work.

724
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I would love to hear my email on your show,

725
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
as I am a big fan and you always seem to have fun.

726
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And you guys are very knowledgeable and,

727
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
more importantly, impartial.

728
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Stay independent.

729
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I love how he says that after a previous listener stumped us.

730
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That's all right.

731
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Note to Loki and Sky.

732
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Every time Dark Soccer reads all the emails and says,

733
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
you should do the same.

734
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
My response, though, back to that first one

735
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
about the PlayStation game.

736
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I played on the Dreamcast.

737
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It came out on the Dreamcast.

738
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's a lot easier to get it to play on the Dreamcast.

739
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yes.

740
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What the?

741
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You found?

742
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Why is it making that noise?

743
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, because I forgot to hit stop earlier

744
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
and it was playing the Portal song from earlier.

745
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But anyway, I did find that...

746
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Sorry, the show.

747
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The show was a lie.

748
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No, but what it was is that apparently

749
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
we found some information on the game on IGN.

750
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Apparently it was a cooking simulator

751
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and it was the first DualShock enhanced cooking simulator on the market.

752
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
No, it wasn't on the Dreamcast.

753
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It just came out the same day as the Dreamcast.

754
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
But they did have a demo in the US.

755
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Whatever.

756
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
On the PlayStation Underground.

757
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
There you have it.

758
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So it was a cooking game.

759
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Maybe that's why they thought you would know

760
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
because you are a Cooking Mama fan extraordinaire.

761
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So maybe this is one of those classic games

762
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
you need to go back and find.

763
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I've been over Cooking Mama for about a month now, you know.

764
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Dude, the sequel's out.

765
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I know. I have to get it.

766
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Anyway, I wanted to say...

767
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I want to make a cake.

768
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I wanted to say to our hardcore fan overseas

769
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that you are not the first person to have an exploding Wii.

770
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That particular issue, I think, is the first time I've heard of that.

771
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Certainly nobody else I've ever heard compares it to hemorrhoid, whatever.

772
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That was kind of weird.

773
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But, you know, every system is going to have some that break.

774
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You know, there's just some faulty stuff on the assembly line.

775
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Anything that comes off an assembly line

776
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
is going to have a fault once in a while.

777
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That game Counter Force kind of looked like a bursting hemorrhoid,

778
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
but, you know, that's just that game, I guess.

779
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So...

780
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But the problem was, at least with the Xbox 360,

781
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
that Red Rings of Death was very prevalent.

782
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
A lot of people had that issue,

783
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and that's why it's become almost like a pop culture gag

784
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
within the gaming scene.

785
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And you do have...

786
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I didn't know there was a podcast called Red Rings of Death,

787
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
but I'm somehow not surprised.

788
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I mean, that's why it's become such a phenomenon

789
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and why Microsoft had to specifically extend the warranty.

790
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
To Nintendo's credit, they've managed to kind of squelch

791
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
a lot of the people complaining about this

792
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
because apparently their customer service is very good.

793
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And as you say, they got your Wii back to you

794
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
in a couple weeks there, just brand spanking new,

795
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and I'm imagining they didn't charge you anything for it, so...

796
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And they also take out hits on people that complain.

797
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Yes.

798
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Nintendo has their own ninja task force.

799
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
If you dare talk smack about Reggie,

800
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
those guys will come to your door and say,

801
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Wii would like to play with guns.

802
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And your head.

803
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So there's more.

804
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
More.

805
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Can I finish the email?

806
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
More.

807
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Thank you.

808
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Spelled M-O-A-R.

809
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
P.S.

810
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Where the fuck is my strategy game for the Wii?

811
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Surely it's perfect for Command & Conquer.

812
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I would even settle for Red Alert Graphics.

813
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Is that asking too much?

814
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yes.

815
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay, then Tiberium Wars?

816
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay.

817
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Are there any strategy games bound for the Wii?

818
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Battle Advance Wars?

819
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Battalion Wars 2, maybe.

820
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And then Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn.

821
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Nice.

822
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn, unfortunately,

823
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
is apparently very much like the last game that came out on the GameCube,

824
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
almost exactly the same.

825
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But we like Fire Emblem.

826
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I just hate playing strategy games myself.

827
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh, and a question for me.

828
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Did you ever play Cannon Fodder?

829
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
This is an awesome game, also should be remade for the Wii.

830
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
War has never been so much fun, and so on.

831
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I know of it.

832
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I actually have not played it.

833
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That sounds familiar.

834
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I've never played it either.

835
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Yet another game stumping the panel here at Orange Line.

836
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
No, I think I did play it, but I just...

837
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
We've talked about Cannon Fodder on the show before.

838
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I thought, hmm?

839
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Back in a while, but I do believe that we have.

840
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
As in our chat room, Cannon Fodder was good, General Chaos was better.

841
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
See, when in doubt, when we're stumped, we always have the chat room

842
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and plenty of people there to rely on their gaming knowledge as well.

843
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
There's one more last bit to this email.

844
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Wow, this goes on forever.

845
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Bye.

846
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's capitalized, so I'd say it that way.

847
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
All right.

848
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Goodbye.

849
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Last email.

850
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Dearest OLR.

851
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Oh, well, that's so sweet of you.

852
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I know.

853
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
A journey of dreams and a new samba de amigo coming to Wii

854
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and Rez coming to Xbox Live Arcade, which I think was Sega.

855
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It seems Sega is what?

856
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
They published it.

857
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah.

858
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah, they published it, yeah.

859
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It seems Sega is giving gamers a chance to play some of their better games

860
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
that were probably missed by most people.

861
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Ow.

862
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Some of those that should have been missed.

863
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Should have remained missed, yes.

864
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
If this is the case, I was wondering what Sega games you would like to see remade

865
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
slash sequelized slash playable again.

866
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Originally, I would love to see Space Channel 5 on Wii,

867
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and it's one of the few games I would like to play by shaking the Wii mode around,

868
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but only if Space Michael still has a part in it.

869
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You took my answer, Jerardimo.

870
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You took my answer, Jerardimo, you jerk.

871
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
That's exactly what I would have said to Space Channel 5.

872
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Now what am I going to say?

873
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Space Channel 5, too.

874
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
No, for real, because the Space Michael levels are so much better.

875
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I love the Pudding Guitar battle.

876
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That's my favorite.

877
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah, but the Space Michael levels are versus battles

878
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
where each side does different dances from the different videos.

879
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
They even do the freaking thriller dance, and I think that's fantastic.

880
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
How about another Crazy Taxi game, but like a good one, not a cheap knockoff.

881
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Crazy Taxi kind of jumped the shark because there was sequel after sequel.

882
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
How about a remade really good Crazy Taxi

883
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
that has more than just the offspring as the music?

884
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
They had bad religion.

885
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, sorry.

886
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Jet Set Radio.

887
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yeah.

888
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Good answer.

889
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's another thing that we need is definitely another Jet Set Radio

890
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
because I freaking love that game.

891
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Odd One agrees with that, Jet Set Radio.

892
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Doing the graffiti with the Wiimote would be awesome in the chat room there.

893
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
GS68 says...

894
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Well, because you'd have to do it in that pattern, right?

895
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
GS68 says Space Harrier and fuck Planet Harrier.

896
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Planet Harrier, okay.

897
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I love Space Harrier, but the thing is that I could not imagine

898
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Space Harrier updated.

899
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The best version, now...

900
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
They did Space Harrier for the Sega Aegis 2900, didn't they?

901
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah, because I think I have that one, but I love playing, actually.

902
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
My favorite thing to play Space Harrier on at home is the 32X

903
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
because it is the arcade version.

904
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You can even reset some of the modes in that

905
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
to where it brings up all the arcade attract stuff.

906
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I got one for you that's perfect for Xbox Live, Fantasy Zone.

907
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Oh, hell yeah.

908
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They probably need to put out Fantasy Zone.

909
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Except, I think that would be kind of...

910
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You would have to do it, though, classic controller only, I think.

911
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Or, how about...

912
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know what game we haven't seen an incarnation of in a long time is Alex Kidd.

913
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Bring me some Alex Kidd.

914
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You know what's actually going to be coming out here pretty soon in January, I think,

915
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
is that Sega Bass Fishing.

916
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Sounds like fun.

917
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Well, let's remember the one on the Dreamcast with the fishing rod.

918
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yeah, with the rod caliber.

919
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Yeah, that game gave us rod caliber.

920
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Good times.

921
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I know that I've mentioned this on the show a bunch of times,

922
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
but you could play Soul Calibur with the fishing rod, and it was really cool.

923
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You know, you can actually play that Soul Calibur Legends.

924
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They have that fishing rod that comes with Hooked, real motion fishing.

925
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Have you tried it?

926
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
No, I have not tried that game because...

927
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, one, I don't want to buy Hooked because it's a fishing game.

928
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I don't fish.

929
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I don't find fishing fun.

930
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Simulating fishing, I think, would be even less fun.

931
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Yeah.

932
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't know.

933
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Anyways, any more emails?

934
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We actually got one from RobWithTwoBees

935
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
that's a link to a story about a boy who hired a hitman

936
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
to kill his parents for PlayStation punishment.

937
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
That's funny.

938
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
A boy, these parents told their son they couldn't play his PlayStation

939
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
for poor grades and bad behavior, and the son tried to hire a hitman.

940
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Oh my god! What's this world coming to?

941
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
These people in Maryland,

942
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Shannon and Joey Troiano from Maryland

943
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
punished their son Cory by confiscating their PlayStation

944
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and hiding it and banned him from watching TV.

945
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
So he tried to hire a hitman.

946
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And his mom actually set him up for a sting.

947
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
God, that kid's retarded. What in the hell is wrong with this family?

948
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
He promised that he would give him his stepfather's new pickup

949
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
as payment for killing his parents.

950
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And then he was arrested.

951
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And somebody was actually going to kill these people over a pickup?

952
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
No, it was... What's this world coming to?

953
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Maybe it was a really nice pickup.

954
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I somehow doubt that. That's crazy talk.

955
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Wow. Wow. And she's quoted as saying,

956
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I miss him being at home, and I miss us joking around and kidding around,

957
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
but in the same breath, I don't know what this kid will do

958
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
because that's not my son.

959
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
That can't be my little boy sitting there.

960
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Wow.

961
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It said that his behavior got worse ever since his father left.

962
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It's like Rosemary's Baby or the omen or something crazy there.

963
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Wow.

964
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Any more emails to depress us?

965
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It said he dropped out of school and stole 45 bucks.

966
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Wow. This guy sounds like a real winner.

967
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah, that's it.

968
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's it for emails.

969
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
If you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

970
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Meanwhile, more news.

971
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
News.

972
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Anyways, so some pretty cool stuff.

973
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
According to Valve, they're adding the Orange Box games

974
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
to the Source Software Development Kit.

975
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So that means that you guys can go out there

976
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and make some cool new levels and mods and whatnot

977
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
for Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2

978
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and all sorts of fun stuff.

979
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Let's see here.

980
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
God, we're going to see shitloads of portal mods.

981
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Included in the Software Development Kit

982
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
are the Hammer World Editor,

983
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
which provides the capability of creating custom levels

984
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
for Source Engine-based games,

985
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Valve's custom Face Poser tool that allows users

986
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
to produce choreographed sequences in the Source Engine,

987
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
a Model Viewer that allows artists

988
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
to preview models and animations quickly,

989
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
a Source Code that allows mod makers

990
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
to create their own games based off of Half-Life 2

991
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
or Half-Life 2 Deathmatch,

992
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
and all the tools required to make, build custom textures

993
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and models for Source Engine games.

994
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So, that's a whole lot of cool stuff.

995
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And I've actually seen, there were some custom maps out there,

996
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
or mods or something like that, with a portal

997
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
that actually had some gravity modifiers in there as well,

998
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
like different sections of the map had different gravity and whatnot.

999
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
So that'd be kind of cool.

1000
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Wow, all right.

1001
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Well, I definitely, you know, I'm looking forward to seeing

1002
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
some of the mods you're going to do,

1003
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
and I would say it's only a matter of time

1004
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
before we get a mod for Portal,

1005
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
where the cake will, in fact, be truth.

1006
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Actually...

1007
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
What?

1008
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And people are saying these are Easter eggs,

1009
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
but I think they're more in-game glitches.

1010
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You can actually get to their room at the end of the credits

1011
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
where the cake is.

1012
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Hmm. Interesting.

1013
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Yeah.

1014
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Hacks, mad hacks, game genies.

1015
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
No, there's ways, if you put in the code

1016
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
where you can shoot portals anywhere on any surface,

1017
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
you can actually get it to where you can clip through the walls sometimes.

1018
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah.

1019
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But there's also, I think it is kind of cool

1020
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
that the whole credit sequence,

1021
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
when you're going through where the pipes are,

1022
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
you can actually...

1023
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
There is a glitch where you can go into that area

1024
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
because it is fully rendered and in the game.

1025
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Well, there's been a healthy donation

1026
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
of some SimCity made by EA.

1027
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You've probably heard of the One Laptop Per Child program.

1028
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This is something where, like,

1029
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
they were going to actually put laptops in classrooms

1030
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
in other countries for children in the classroom.

1031
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, EA has actually donated the original version of SimCity

1032
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
to be pre-installed on all machines.

1033
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So, kind of interesting, a very classic game, SimCity.

1034
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It kind of teaches you something about city management

1035
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and certainly uses logic and a lot of other skills in the game.

1036
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
So there you have it.

1037
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Being donated by Electronic Arts

1038
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
for every one of those $100 laptops.

1039
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's pretty cool.

1040
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Donations are cool, but seriously,

1041
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
couldn't they have pwned in the money for SimCity 2000?

1042
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
No, I'm just kidding.

1043
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
The classic is way better.

1044
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I hate SimCity 2000.

1045
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Well, it's also the laptop's pretty old.

1046
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I mean, well, not $100.

1047
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
They're 100 bucks. Hello.

1048
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The processor in it is not exactly powerful and stuff, so...

1049
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Okay, look, as long as they play Oregon Trail,

1050
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
what else do you need?

1051
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
That's what kids need in this school.

1052
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Exactly. That should have been Oregon Trail.

1053
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So then they would need a Mac.

1054
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Or just an Apple IIe with the green monitor.

1055
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Apple IIe.

1056
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Those things for the shit.

1057
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And I want all these kids to learn Logo.

1058
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Oh.

1059
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Pen down.

1060
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Forward 20.

1061
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Right 90.

1062
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Forward 20.

1063
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Right 90.

1064
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Hey, guess what?

1065
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Atari 2600 News.

1066
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The Atari 2600 has been inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame

1067
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
at the Strong National Museum of Play.

1068
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You know what the other two things that were inducted were along with it?

1069
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Raggedy Ann.

1070
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
No, Raggedy Andy.

1071
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Sorry.

1072
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And the kite.

1073
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but with toys.

1074
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,000
The museum's curator has said that the Atari system paved the way for today's gaming consoles

1075
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,000
and quote mesmerized a generation with games such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Frogger.

1076
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The kite.

1077
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So that's pretty cool.

1078
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, apparently it's also in there with the teddy bear roller skates and Mr. Potato Head.

1079
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Is Light Bright in the Toy Hall of Fame?

1080
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I don't know, but it should be, dammit.

1081
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It should be, absolutely.

1082
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And before they made them crappy, I want the Light Brights that could like set on fire

1083
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
if you played Light Bright for too long.

1084
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Because Light Bright is the greatest toy of all time.

1085
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And by the way, by the way, my classic computer love goes towards the Texas Instruments computer.

1086
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I want a Light Bright.

1087
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Let's make that happen.

1088
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I want a Light Bright so we can put O.L.R.

1089
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I had a Light Bright.

1090
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Did I tell you?

1091
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I swear to God we're going to like the flea market soon.

1092
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But the thing is that my peers would always get mad at me because I would have them buy

1093
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
me extra dots and I would make my own pictures.

1094
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I would never use the things that came with them.

1095
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I made my own pictures.

1096
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I made patterns.

1097
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Patterns are my thing.

1098
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But you know what I found?

1099
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
At a yard sale like a year ago, I found Transformers Light Bright patterns.

1100
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That's awesome.

1101
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
So I kept them.

1102
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I bought them.

1103
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I totally want a Light Bright.

1104
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Can't you imagine putting a Light Bright here on the shelf?

1105
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Guys, listeners, find us a Light Bright.

1106
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We implore.

1107
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
eBay?

1108
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I swear to God I'm going to yard sales.

1109
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm going to eBay right now.

1110
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Please do.

1111
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,200
Anyways, in case you've been living under a rock, the Writers Guild of America is striking

1112
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
right now.

1113
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,200
I mean, it's just a surprise.

1114
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Anyways, so what that means is a lot of movie productions have halted and one of those movies

1115
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:04,380
that's kind of been put on the brakes, I guess, Wolfenstein and Sci-Fi Wire apparently is

1116
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:11,040
reporting that the script is almost done, but everything as far as the production date

1117
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,280
and that kind of thing won't be decided until after all of this is over.

1118
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:25,180
And of course, you know, Roger Avery fully supports the strike and yeah.

1119
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:31,000
So darn, I guess we have to wait for a Wolfenstein movie.

1120
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Just a thought.

1121
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,400
It's probably going to suck.

1122
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
So take your time.

1123
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
It's alright.

1124
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,800
And if the movie sucks, I will go on strike from doing this program.

1125
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
There was somebody commented, I want to say this on Any Cool News or something like that,

1126
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,960
and I'm sure people have made the same kind of comments, that TV watchers and movie watchers

1127
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,360
should have their own guild and strike when there's like crappy movies.

1128
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
Refuse to watch them.

1129
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,280
Why the hell does a light bright have $52 shipping on it?

1130
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,280
Christ.

1131
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,280
Sorry.

1132
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,520
That's a light truck.

1133
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,000
And then the ones, I found a light bright for 25 bucks.

1134
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Well, I think the whole Rider Strike thing does kind of, I mean, it's unfortunate.

1135
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,960
Well, the reason why it has $52 shipping is probably because the sale price, if it's cheap

1136
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,800
enough, they don't have to pay as much of an eBay tax, I guess, on that thing or the,

1137
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,160
you know, eBay doesn't get as big of a portion and then that way they can just make it all

1138
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,360
up in shipping.

1139
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,240
That's cheap.

1140
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
That's working the system.

1141
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,520
They need to have one with a buy it now on here.

1142
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Alright.

1143
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,840
And I would like to point out that Marissa in our chat room says light bright has become

1144
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,120
modern with light bright flat screen.

1145
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,680
Yeah, and I want an old one, like the one I had from 1982.

1146
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,880
Can you find an Etch A Sketch while you're at it?

1147
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,440
Okay, I found a 1986 light bright refill pack.

1148
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,440
Rad.

1149
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,720
We might have to get that so we get plenty of orange pegs.

1150
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,800
Anyhow, something else from the 80s that is awesome is The Last Starfighter.

1151
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,040
Yes.

1152
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,840
And remember how The Last Starfighter had like a video game kind of in it, but it was

1153
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,840
never actually a game?

1154
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,720
It was supposed to be a game, but it wasn't.

1155
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:13,000
Well, what happened is that this guy actually put together a copy of the Starfighter game

1156
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,680
and actually put it in the cabinet.

1157
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,680
Atari had made this full final version of the game, but they never actually put it out.

1158
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:25,800
But thanks to the love and hardcoreness, for lack of a better term, of this guy, he can

1159
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,160
now play Starfighter in his house.

1160
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,600
I mean, this comes complete with like the levers and everything.

1161
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,120
This isn't just in any old cabinet.

1162
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,480
This isn't like an actual cabinet like the one from the movie.

1163
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:44,000
If you want to see this for yourself, Roguesynapse.com, let me spell that for you guys, R-O-G-U-E-S-Y-N-A-P-S-E.com.

1164
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,840
You found a virtual light bright?

1165
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,520
One of our chatters linked it.

1166
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,520
That's just not as cool.

1167
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
I'm sorry to say.

1168
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,800
I appreciate the effort.

1169
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,800
So that's pretty cool.

1170
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,120
So if you want to play Starfighter for yourself, head on over because they have a download

1171
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,140
link on that page, Roguesynapse.com.

1172
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,640
So moving on with the gaming news.

1173
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,360
Dude, I was playing light bright, Rob.

1174
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,360
Sorry.

1175
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,360
Sorry.

1176
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,760
Anyhoo, moving on.

1177
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:18,560
For our anime fans in the chat room, there is a Persona 3 anime to be out in January.

1178
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:24,680
Being put out by Aniplex's A-1 Pictures, they are adapting it for a...

1179
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:30,320
It's actually going to be called Persona Trinity Soul in January 2008, which is set a decade

1180
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:39,340
after the game and will center around three brothers in a city where the dead have turned

1181
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,960
their skins inside out.

1182
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Ew.

1183
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
Yeah.

1184
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,080
I'll probably watch it.

1185
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,080
That sounds really cool.

1186
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,160
Is that kind of like that guy in PBS?

1187
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,400
I don't think so.

1188
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,920
There's a lot of people that love their Persona, so this is, I'm sure, good news to a lot of

1189
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,360
the fans of Persona 3.

1190
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,600
I think so.

1191
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Inside out, man.

1192
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Anyways.

1193
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:10,080
So, speaking of eBay earlier, if you're desperate for some celebrity memorabilia, eBay of course

1194
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:16,600
is the place to find it, and since this is vaguely game-related, Gary Coleman is selling

1195
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
his GameCube.

1196
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:25,800
Yes, times are pretty hard for old Gary, and of course he is signing his GameCube as well

1197
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:32,320
as the games coming with it, which if I remember correctly there was one from Robots, the movie

1198
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,840
of the game, and some other crap in there.

1199
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,960
So let's see here.

1200
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:46,040
So if you're interested in it, only $510 right now is the going price for it.

1201
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,720
Let's see, it includes Mortal Kombat Deception, Super Smash Brothers Melee, Mario Kart Double

1202
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:58,960
Dash, Sonic 2, Adventure Battle, and Sonic Gems Collection.

1203
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,760
Nice.

1204
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:07,680
And Gary Coleman has signed each one of those things, so now you can own a piece of Gary.

1205
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,160
A little itty bitty piece.

1206
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,720
He's welcome to keep it.

1207
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,120
Former mayoral candidate, or I mean, gubernatorial candidate here in California.

1208
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,720
You might remember when Gary Coleman ran for governor, remember?

1209
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,480
He didn't even freakin' make the top ten.

1210
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,480
I know.

1211
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,680
Although, that one porn star did, she was in the top ten, the Mary Carey or whatever

1212
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,680
she was.

1213
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,160
Hey, I totally supported her because- Wasn't she like promising like a blowjob for everyone

1214
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
that voted for her?

1215
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,160
Probably.

1216
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
That's my vote.

1217
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,240
I would like to point out that, and I apologize if I'm butchering this name in our chat room,

1218
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,520
Necro Arca in our chat room linked us to a Lite Brite Cube.

1219
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,480
It's a modern version of the Lite Brite that's available on Amazon.

1220
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,160
It's actually like four sides to it.

1221
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,560
I know a cube has six sides, but the top and bottom don't actually do anything.

1222
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,840
But that's kind of neat because you can put a pattern on every side.

1223
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
That is pretty cool.

1224
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,520
But I want an old school one, yo.

1225
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,880
15 bucks for that.

1226
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,880
No way.

1227
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,880
I want an old, old one.

1228
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,880
Yeah, I want an old school one.

1229
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,080
Like the kind that gets so hot that you can't touch it.

1230
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,080
I know.

1231
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,640
Yeah, but you know what you can do with that?

1232
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,680
Lite Brite companion cube.

1233
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
Yes.

1234
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,680
Good time.

1235
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,840
You know what I'm going to do as soon as I learn how to sew?

1236
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,960
I'm going to make myself a weighted companion cube purse.

1237
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,600
People are crazy about their weighted companion cube.

1238
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,040
I still have not played Portal, so these jokes go over my head.

1239
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,120
But this joke I get, and I think it's hilarious, because one of the first games I ever remember

1240
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,560
playing on the Commodore 64 was Zork.

1241
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,800
And Zork has apparently been smooshed with Pac-Man to create this homegrown game, Packed

1242
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,040
TXT, and it's available for play at pac-txt.com.

1243
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,000
It's Pac-Man meets Zork.

1244
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,640
And yes, it's as stupid as it sounds.

1245
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,480
You actually play Pac-Man, but it's in Zork format.

1246
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,920
In other words, you go, eat, and it says, you have eaten another glowing dot, and you

1247
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
type forward.

1248
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,360
You have moved forward.

1249
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,540
So stupid, it's hilarious, but I'm sure it will get old in about five minutes.

1250
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,880
There you have it.

1251
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,880
Anyhow, if you would like to give us a call, our Skype line is now open for business, 1-877-game-over.

1252
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,880
I doubt we'll have anything as exciting as the Nintendo World Store call from earlier,

1253
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,000
and Zaku actually sounding not high this week.

1254
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,280
But who knows?

1255
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,640
I'm sure our folks will try.

1256
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,920
So meanwhile, while we wait for some calls since there is a little bit of a delay, let's

1257
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,520
see if there's any last minute stories from here in chat, or here in studio.

1258
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,240
Hey, I'm not a chat.

1259
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
I'm a me.

1260
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
Sorry.

1261
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
My bad.

1262
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:49,480
Here's an interesting one, Eiji Onomura was interviewed in the last issue of Official

1263
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:55,240
Nintendo Magazine, of course that's in the UK, talking about what his interests are in

1264
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,200
the Legend of Zelda series and how he'd like to continue it.

1265
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,560
One thing he's interested in doing is a 3D remake of A Link to the Past, which would

1266
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,560
be fucking awesome.

1267
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,560
So I hope they do that.

1268
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,560
That would be fucking awesome.

1269
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,200
And do it in the Wind Waker Engine, none of this fucking Twilight Princess shit.

1270
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,400
Alright, we're getting a phone call.

1271
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Let's go take it.

1272
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1273
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
Who's this?

1274
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Oh my god, I'm on.

1275
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,240
This is Odd1 from the chat room.

1276
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,760
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

1277
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,760
Wow.

1278
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,760
Odd1.

1279
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,760
Odd1.

1280
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,760
O-D-D-O-N-E.

1281
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
Yeah.

1282
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,760
You made it.

1283
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,760
You're a first time live listener tonight, right?

1284
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,960
Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for years while I was working.

1285
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,280
You guys got me through some really tough, long hours, and I'm so grateful to you guys.

1286
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,280
Wow.

1287
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,280
I just want to say thanks.

1288
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,280
Thank you.

1289
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,880
It's words like that that seriously keep us motivated, because we do this.

1290
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,960
We don't make any money off of it, unlike some of the other podcasts out there that

1291
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,320
are just out there to support their magazines and websites and stuff.

1292
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,920
So thank you very much.

1293
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,920
That's very flattering.

1294
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,920
I do this for Monopoly money.

1295
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,920
Oh, sorry.

1296
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,920
I do this for Monopoly money.

1297
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,680
Yeah, you take beer for the love, and it shows.

1298
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
That's true.

1299
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,680
Dark Soccer gets free beer out of this.

1300
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,680
I get free beer.

1301
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,240
So when we have extra beer, Dark Soccer comes to my house and drinks all my beer.

1302
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,360
Anyway, what's on your mind, Audwin?

1303
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,160
Honestly, I didn't think I'd get through.

1304
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
I don't have much on my mind.

1305
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,560
I just wanted to say thanks, and now that I get free time, I'm going to be listening

1306
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,160
live every week.

1307
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,200
Seriously, you guys are just the best.

1308
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,200
You're welcome.

1309
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,200
Thank you so much.

1310
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,200
Well, then tell us about your gaming week real quick.

1311
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,200
We'll ask you questions.

1312
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,200
Oh, my God.

1313
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,200
How is your gaming week?

1314
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
What games have you been playing?

1315
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,000
Man, all I got here is a GameCube right now.

1316
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,280
Is it Gary Coleman's GameCube?

1317
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,880
It's no good at all.

1318
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,600
Okay, well, the GameCube's not horrible.

1319
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,560
I'm assuming it's a money thing, which is why you don't have the next-gen systems.

1320
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,520
It's a money thing.

1321
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,160
It's a stolen system thing.

1322
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,760
I don't even want to go into it.

1323
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,480
All right, well, let's say you had $400 in your pocket right now, enough to buy any of

1324
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,500
the next-gen systems.

1325
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
Which one would you buy and why?

1326
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:11,440
You know, I'd probably buy a Wii and about 20 million of those Wii points because, especially

1327
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,520
with the Neo Geo, the Virtual Console is just hot.

1328
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,160
I need that in my life.

1329
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,160
It is hot.

1330
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,120
Like, seriously, my Wii wasn't even plugged in for about three weeks.

1331
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,920
And I finally went and plugged it back in today because I wanted to check out some of

1332
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,160
the new stuff like the Check Me Out channel and Mario 3.

1333
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,200
And I went back on, and I saw that Simon's Quest was on Virtual Console, and I completely

1334
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,200
forgot about it.

1335
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,440
And when I saw it, I seriously, I think I got a semi.

1336
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,480
Like, that game is so awesome.

1337
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,320
Even with the shitty translation, it's fun.

1338
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,840
What a terrible night to have a curse.

1339
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,840
That game.

1340
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
The game is awesome.

1341
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,520
Seriously, one of the best soundtracks of all time.

1342
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,960
So yeah, just lots of choice.

1343
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,360
And I know people say, just play them in emulators for free and blah, blah, blah.

1344
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,360
But I don't know.

1345
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,080
There's something rewarding about having the authentic experience because you know Nintendo,

1346
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,560
you know, it's coming from the official source, and the fact that I can play it on my HDTV,

1347
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,560
like in the old school Nintendo.

1348
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,560
I don't know.

1349
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,600
There's something about that that for whatever reason, maybe I'm just lazy and don't want

1350
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,760
to hook up the whole like Dreamcast and burn the CD or whatever.

1351
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,320
There's something about it that just, I don't know, is worth the five bucks.

1352
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,960
Well I mean, and also, you know, I associate my computer with work.

1353
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,880
I'll play on it, but you know, when I want to relax, I get on my couch and turn on my

1354
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,880
TV.

1355
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,880
That's a good point.

1356
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
That's a good point.

1357
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,480
Like I don't like to play games on the computer that were originally designed for the console.

1358
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,720
Something like World of Warcraft or PC develop games, I have no problem playing those on

1359
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,720
the PC.

1360
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,940
Why do you think I have so many video game systems?

1361
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,440
So you can sit on the couch.

1362
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:50,880
So I can sit on my couch and use my original controller and play the game.

1363
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
There you have it.

1364
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
Exactly.

1365
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,960
Alright, well I'm going to let you go.

1366
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,520
Thank you so much for taking my call.

1367
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,880
No problem Odd1.

1368
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,040
It's very nice to hear such enthusiasm.

1369
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,320
It makes us even more excited.

1370
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,440
So thank you Odd1 for your call.

1371
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,440
We appreciate it.

1372
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Have a good one.

1373
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
Bye.

1374
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,440
Bye bye.

1375
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,840
He had just had so much enthusiasm, like was generally happy to be on the show.

1376
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,840
I love that.

1377
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,840
So great.

1378
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840
Thank you so much.

1379
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
Let's go to another call.

1380
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1381
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
Who's this?

1382
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,840
This is Zormay.

1383
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,840
Hello, it's Zormay.

1384
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
What's up with mine?

1385
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:28,520
Yeah, I just wanted to talk about just like an overall gaming this year.

1386
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,400
You know it's like this week, Mario Galaxy and Assassin's Creed is coming out.

1387
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,440
Do y'all find it hard to keep up with all these games?

1388
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:47,360
Like I know we have like, you're married, Loki, along with Dr. Kara.

1389
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,160
This is a huge week for games.

1390
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,400
Yeah, this is feedback.

1391
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,840
I know this is, with Christmas and everything, it's just like everything is coming out this

1392
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,840
week.

1393
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:01,080
Well, I'm trying to say, do you need a chance to actually play them all?

1394
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:06,560
Do you find yourself able to play them like as if you would play it, like do you get all

1395
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,840
your fun out of them, like your money for it?

1396
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,400
Do we have time to play all these games?

1397
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,400
Oh, no.

1398
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,360
Well, given all the other projects that I have going on myself, I don't have time.

1399
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,360
Hold on.

1400
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,560
We're getting the really bad echo, Zormay, so we're going to have to let you go, but

1401
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,600
we'll answer your questions or keep listening to the show.

1402
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,680
But unfortunately, we're getting the really bad echo, I'm sorry, buddy.

1403
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,240
But let's answer the question, do we have time to play all these games that come out?

1404
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,440
I personally do not, just given that I have a very busy schedule.

1405
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,920
I know I'm also, I haven't gone into a lot of detail on this, but I'm working on an illustration

1406
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,920
project.

1407
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,920
I'm still going to classes as a massage therapist.

1408
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,840
I work as a massage therapist, too.

1409
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,320
And with my full-time job, I don't have as much time as I would like to play some of

1410
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,440
these games, although I am dedicating time to Portal next week.

1411
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,440
I wish I had more time for games, but I find myself the same problem with the day job and

1412
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,400
relationships and everything, but here's my problem is that I keep coming back to the

1413
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,280
freaking MMOs that suck my life away, and I'm talking about WoW, Final Fantasy XI, if

1414
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,720
Jamie gets her way, Ragnarok, my friends trying to get me into Tabula Rasa, which I really

1415
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,720
want to check out.

1416
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,240
You know, there's just all these freaking MMOs I keep getting sucked into, and those

1417
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,840
are games that never finish, so you just keep going back for more, and I never have time

1418
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,160
to play the console games.

1419
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,560
But I do try to play a little bit of everything.

1420
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:26,160
That's what makes it so easy to stay on top of the Xbox Live Arcade releases and everything.

1421
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,240
You know, those are delivered right to your doorstep, and they're usually really short

1422
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,240
games.

1423
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,380
I try to sample as much as I can, but I may not play everything.

1424
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:37,640
For example, right now, when I was playing Portal, I wasn't playing Halo 3 or anything

1425
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
else like that.

1426
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,400
In Assassin's Creed, to be honest, I only played about 15 minutes of it today, and same

1427
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,860
with Super Mario Galaxy, I think I maybe played half an hour of it.

1428
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:51,720
I used to buy games left and right that I would probably only end up playing for like

1429
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,060
an hour, but I've really learned to curb that this year, and I've seriously been a good

1430
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,480
boy and not bought games that I don't plan on spending serious time with.

1431
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,200
So that's my other problem, is that, you know, remember, we do this for the love of the game

1432
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,280
because we're fans of gaming and everything.

1433
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,080
We don't get a lot of free games from companies.

1434
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,740
Once in a great while, we've gotten free games, and so, you know, if we had more free games,

1435
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,500
we could easily dedicate, you know, an hour between three of us, you know, each playing

1436
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
games or whatever.

1437
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,080
The last free game I got was Dragon's Lair HD.

1438
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,360
I can't remember the last free game we got.

1439
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:28,000
Last free game I got, and I don't want it, and I will be selling it back, Viva Pinata

1440
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Party Animals.

1441
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Aw, sorry to hear it.

1442
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Well, I'll take that back.

1443
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,680
Dan got us our Halo 3 for free, and a bunch of other stuff.

1444
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,040
The last free one I can remember getting was the mid-way- a mid-way rep I met at a show

1445
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,400
was kind enough to give me one of those arcade classics, which was great for me because I

1446
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,920
loved that shit, those AD games, so that was cool, but that was a long time ago.

1447
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:47,920
Oh no.

1448
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,920
Play Overlord.

1449
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,960
Folks in chat are suggesting Gamefly.

1450
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,920
Yes, I will play Overlord, I swear.

1451
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,960
I will step away from Final Fantasy XI this week, the crack, the crack, and play some

1452
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Overlord.

1453
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,960
All right.

1454
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,720
Skype line is still open if you want to give us a call.

1455
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:06,040
Just a word of advice, call Echo 1-2-3 before you call us on the Skype, and that way you

1456
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,580
can hear what you sound like, and you can hear if there's any, like, echoing or any

1457
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,580
of that stuff.

1458
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:14,180
If your microphone is really close to your speakers, that's what causes the echo, so

1459
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,180
sorry.

1460
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,180
It's okay.

1461
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,000
Any other last minute stories real quick while we wait for some more calls?

1462
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,480
Yeah, of course I do.

1463
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,680
Anyways, Attack of the Show is now in the Guinness Book of World Records for creating

1464
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,280
the largest arcade machine.

1465
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:36,880
It is 1,300 pounds, has 150 arcade games built into it, 14 feet tall, and has a 75 inch screen,

1466
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,440
plus it requires quarters that are 3 inches big.

1467
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,840
They like big things on that program, don't they, because they made a big Nintendo once,

1468
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
didn't they?

1469
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
I remember that at 1E3.

1470
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,840
They had that out there.

1471
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,200
And I will one-up everything they do.

1472
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,440
All right, let's go to the phones.

1473
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,440
We have another call.

1474
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,440
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1475
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,440
Who's this?

1476
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,440
Hello.

1477
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,440
Hi.

1478
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Who is this?

1479
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,440
Hello.

1480
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,440
This is Marissa.

1481
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,440
Hello.

1482
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,440
Marissa!

1483
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,440
Marissa!

1484
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,440
Hey.

1485
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,440
What's on your mind?

1486
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,440
I was calling to say hello.

1487
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,160
It's so nice to be able to hear the show this evening.

1488
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,160
Yes.

1489
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,160
It's a blast.

1490
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,160
Very random that you're listening to us live.

1491
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,160
Hello?

1492
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
We love it.

1493
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,160
I said it's very random that you're listening to us live.

1494
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,160
We love it.

1495
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,160
That's very cool.

1496
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,560
I actually finally came across this thing known as a computer, and I purchased one.

1497
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,000
I had been out of one for about a year because I just didn't have the money, but now I'm

1498
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
back.

1499
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,720
But I unfortunately have Windows Vista on a budget laptop, so I'm kind of screwed game

1500
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,720
wise.

1501
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:30,720
Excellent.

1502
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,520
Now, since you have a new computer, has your gaming on the PC consisted of Solitaire and

1503
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,520
Minesweeper?

1504
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,600
Well, especially on Vista.

1505
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:45,280
With what bloatware Vista is, yeah, because it eats all my memory.

1506
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,880
Although I was lucky enough, I went to Target before going to Seattle to try to get some

1507
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,880
games because I took a train trip to Seattle.

1508
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,280
And so I wanted to have something to pass the time because it's like 38 hours.

1509
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,280
And I got King's Quest.

1510
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,280
Awesome.

1511
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,280
King's Quest is the shit.

1512
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:11,280
They re-released all of them onto, you know, it's supposed to be compatible with Windows

1513
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,760
2000, but it doesn't work for Vista very well, but oh well, that was cool.

1514
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,440
That sucks because the King's Quest series was amazing.

1515
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,200
I loved those games when I was younger, especially King's Quest IV.

1516
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,800
That was always my favorite because it was based on the fairy tales.

1517
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
That was cool.

1518
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,880
I basically bought a laptop and went backwards in time because the first thing I did was

1519
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,800
get King's Quest and then the new Simon Max.

1520
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,800
Very, very cool.

1521
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,800
Very cool.

1522
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,920
That was really cool, but I don't like these episodic games because I don't like paying

1523
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,200
$20 for like half an hour worth of games.

1524
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
Here's the thing.

1525
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,280
You've got to get GameTap because not only are all the King's Quest games available on

1526
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,440
there, but they also have the Sam and Max, but the only bummer is you have to have an

1527
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,960
internet connection, so it's not so great for the train.

1528
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,320
But you know, you can play for like $9.85 a month all the new Sam and Max games.

1529
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:59,160
God, I sound like a commercial, but I wouldn't hype it up if it wasn't good.

1530
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
I mean, it is good.

1531
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,160
I think they've done a good thing, and I know a lot of people are rightfully so skeptical

1532
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,840
about GameTap, but I think overall in the big picture, I mean, they've got like a thousand

1533
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,960
games on there, classics, new stuff.

1534
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,360
I mean, Overlord is available on GameTap and some other stuff, so it's good.

1535
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
It's a good thing.

1536
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,360
Oh, sweet.

1537
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,360
Old stuff for me.

1538
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
Otherwise, the dude bought an Xbox.

1539
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,360
Oh, really?

1540
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:26,640
Yeah, so now I've spent my evenings falling asleep in front of the TV while he plays Medal

1541
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,640
of Honor.

1542
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,640
Good times.

1543
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,640
Good times.

1544
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,640
Good times.

1545
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,640
He dates up in a 360, right?

1546
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,640
Yes.

1547
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:37,800
I'm going to have to talk to you later to get his gamertag, and I'll give you Dan's

1548
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,800
and mine.

1549
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,800
Oh, quite simple.

1550
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
Long hair Chris.

1551
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,800
Long hair Chris.

1552
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
Oh, that makes...

1553
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,800
That's a castle, my boyfriend.

1554
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,800
There you go.

1555
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,120
You do know like thousands of people that hear our show just heard that, right?

1556
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,840
If you get some more friend requests this week, you'll know why.

1557
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:56,000
Well, okay, I'll go ahead and put Dan's on there, except I can't remember if it's with

1558
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,800
an underscore or not, but it would be Gunstar Hero.

1559
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,800
Okay.

1560
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:04,800
So, I'll let you know for sure later, and mine I never use, so I'll let you know later.

1561
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:09,280
But if he's got Halo 3, he should totally play with Dan so I can see Dan get punked.

1562
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,280
Let's all play Uno.

1563
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,280
He's waiting for that, yeah.

1564
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,840
I'm not trying to talk him into getting the orange box, because I really want to play

1565
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
Portal.

1566
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,840
Yeah.

1567
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,840
And he won't stop singing the song.

1568
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,840
Isn't the song great?

1569
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,680
Okay, I didn't get it at first, and it was when I finally saw it that I was like, this

1570
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,680
is the best song ever.

1571
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,680
Seriously, Jamie was...

1572
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,720
I remember when that song was in the cage match, and Jamie was like, this song is stupid.

1573
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,720
Why do people love this song?

1574
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:33,840
Well, no, I said as a song without a frame of reference, it wasn't a very good song,

1575
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,520
but now that I have the framework, now that I logged into that stupid site and took the

1576
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,800
quiz that was on it, the personality thing, I was like, holy crap, this is messed up.

1577
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,800
I love it.

1578
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,480
Okay, yes, I think that's why it is so cool, although it does bring a different dimension

1579
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,520
of weird when your coworker is singing it in a high-pitched falsetto while you're on

1580
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,520
the phone with a client.

1581
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:53,520
Oh, that's cool.

1582
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,520
Nice.

1583
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,520
Well, Marissa...

1584
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,520
Oh, how'd you guys go?

1585
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,520
It was great catching up.

1586
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,800
Marissa, please, please log into Xbox Live sometime and we'll play Uno.

1587
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,480
Oh, sweet.

1588
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,520
And I'll hook up my webcam and play Strip Uno.

1589
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,520
No, just kidding.

1590
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,520
Do you have an Amazon wish list ready?

1591
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,520
I can't wait.

1592
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,520
All right.

1593
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,520
Come on, baby.

1594
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,200
Marissa, thanks so much for calling.

1595
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,200
We love you.

1596
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,200
Bye, Marissa.

1597
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,200
Come back and be in the studio soon, okay?

1598
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,200
Okay, bye.

1599
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,200
All right, bye.

1600
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:27,440
She has to come back soon so we can hear more stories about the Wunderbra.

1601
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,040
These Wunderbra ears.

1602
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,040
That was it.

1603
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,040
I thought it was the Wunderbra.

1604
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Great.

1605
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,720
All right, more last-minute stories.

1606
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,800
We'll take one more call if anybody calls in, 877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange

1607
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,800
Launch Radio.

1608
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:47,480
Anyways, there's apparently a new Bioshock achievement that someone spotted on Live.

1609
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:54,000
The rumor is the 51st achievement, which is actually on the list there, is 100 points

1610
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,520
and it is from...

1611
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,520
It's called Bulletproof.

1612
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:00,840
Complete the game on hard difficulty without using a Vited Chamber.

1613
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,280
So be interesting to see if this actually surfaces maybe in a new update or something

1614
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,280
like that.

1615
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,160
Anyways, let's see here.

1616
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,160
Benjokazooie3, not coming out in 360 anymore.

1617
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,160
It's been axed.

1618
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,160
So, hooray.

1619
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,160
Oh, wait.

1620
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,920
There was something about...

1621
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,980
I saw on Twitter that there was going to be big news coming out about a 360 exclusive

1622
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:24,980
being axed.

1623
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:25,980
This must be it.

1624
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:26,980
This is the one.

1625
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:27,980
Oh, snap.

1626
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,980
All right.

1627
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:29,980
We're getting one more call.

1628
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:30,980
Oh, it went away.

1629
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:31,980
Never mind.

1630
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:35,640
One more thing to kind of go back to the MAME cabinet we were talking about earlier.

1631
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:36,640
Game Raider.

1632
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,380
It brings together MAME and beer.

1633
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,360
It's a beer tap in a MAME cabinet.

1634
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Hold that thought.

1635
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,360
We got a call coming in.

1636
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,360
I do want to hear more about the beer thing, but this is a conference call, so I'm always

1637
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,360
worried about these calls.

1638
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,360
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1639
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,360
Who's this?

1640
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,360
Tekken Game Podcast.

1641
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,360
Hi.

1642
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:53,580
The Bucket, Toki's and Raiden's Dolphin.

1643
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,280
What's up, you guys?

1644
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,280
Not much.

1645
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,280
You were talking about Sam & Max?

1646
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,280
Yes.

1647
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,800
Our last caller, Marissa, is a Sam & Max fan.

1648
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,800
I am huge.

1649
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,080
I beat the new one today, and oh my God, it's awesome.

1650
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,080
Is it?

1651
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,160
About how long of gaming was it?

1652
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,340
About five hours, but they really changed up some things about it.

1653
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:18,520
They added Stinky's Tavern as a restaurant, 50's theme.

1654
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,520
Really nice.

1655
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,520
I really love it.

1656
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,320
And Santa goes nuts.

1657
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,320
Can't go wrong with that.

1658
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,320
Lots of fun.

1659
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,320
Lots of fun stuff.

1660
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,880
Those are great.

1661
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,720
Is this taking a lot of time on your show recently, the Sam & Max series?

1662
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,720
No.

1663
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,720
Call of Duty.

1664
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,720
Call of Duty.

1665
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,720
Well that's cool.

1666
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,720
Sam & Max is a good franchise.

1667
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,640
One of those ones I need to spend more time with, but those damn MMOs, you know how it

1668
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,640
goes.

1669
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,640
No.

1670
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,720
Yeah, but this one has a hit feature, so it's much easier for the noobs to get in.

1671
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:53,320
Marissa, in our chat room, actually follows up and says, Sam & Max rules, but Indiana

1672
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,640
Jones and the fate of Atlantis is still number one in my heart.

1673
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,640
How about Loom?

1674
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,640
That's fine.

1675
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,640
Where's the love for Loom?

1676
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,640
Loom is great.

1677
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,640
Loom is awesome.

1678
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Loom.

1679
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,280
Well, what else did you guys want to share with us?

1680
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,280
Anything else?

1681
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,360
Over alerts on GameTap, download it from there.

1682
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,720
Well, I have a copy on Xbox 360, and that way I can get achievement points because I'm

1683
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,800
a whore for achievement points.

1684
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
Ah, you're right.

1685
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Yep.

1686
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
I can play Jericho or something on GameTap.

1687
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,800
Ah, Jericho.

1688
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
Didn't Jericho suck?

1689
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,240
Well, I've heard that, but I want to see that firsthand, if it does suck.

1690
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,360
Okay, because that's what everyone said to me, like, big disappointment, it sucks, stay

1691
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,360
away.

1692
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,080
Yeah, that's what I keep hearing, but I like to see these things firsthand.

1693
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:31,000
I will tell you what kind of cool zombie game I've been playing on GameTap is Typing of

1694
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
the Dead.

1695
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
That game is shit.

1696
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Oh, that's awesome.

1697
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I've been playing that a little.

1698
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,840
It's a steep learning curve to get all those letters in.

1699
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,040
I can type uber fast.

1700
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,920
Maybe because you can't type, Raven.

1701
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,800
You type with two fingers, Raven, that you're not going to get very far doing that.

1702
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,800
Nah, you're right.

1703
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,800
All right.

1704
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,560
Well, kids, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks

1705
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,560
so much for calling.

1706
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,560
Thanks for taking our call.

1707
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,560
You're welcome.

1708
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,560
Have a good one, you guys.

1709
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,560
Have fun with your show.

1710
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,560
All right.

1711
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,920
Raven and DeBucket from Tekken Games, which I think is beating us on Op 11 still.

1712
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,920
You go, boys.

1713
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,920
All right.

1714
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,920
Any other last minute stories?

1715
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,920
We're talking about the beer and maim machine.

1716
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:07,920
Yes.

1717
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,920
Skypline is now closed, kids.

1718
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,360
Sorry if those didn't get through.

1719
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:17,080
The Gamerator, it's $2,000, but it's a custom-built maim cabinet, and it comes preloaded, of course,

1720
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,080
with 180 games.

1721
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:24,960
Plus, it's got an internal AV hookups, lets you throw your PC or console in there as well.

1722
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,160
And then, of course, it doubles as a keg.

1723
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:32,960
It's got tap and everything, so that's awesome.

1724
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,000
Beer and maim together.

1725
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,840
Another interesting thing, I guess, there is a sequel to Dig Dug 2 coming.

1726
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,640
I guess it's called Dig Dug Islands.

1727
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:51,920
It's actually being, Namco Bandai has partnered with Verx to produce it as an online PC game.

1728
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,160
So if you're interested in more Dig Dug, there you go.

1729
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,160
Some last bits.

1730
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,120
There already was like a Dig Dug one and a half on DS.

1731
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,440
I had it.

1732
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,320
Yeah, Dig Dug DS.

1733
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,840
I have it.

1734
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:12,400
Anyways, Nexon, of course, that South Korean company doing a lot of MMOs and stuff, they're

1735
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,000
developing a couple games for, well, one for the Xbox 360 and one for the DS.

1736
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,540
MapleStory is coming to the DS, so that's the one that's being worked on right now.

1737
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:28,040
The other one is a MMO called Mabinogi, and that's coming to the 360.

1738
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:35,400
So I guess Mabinogi is a cel-shaded MMO that looks interesting.

1739
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,560
And then MapleStory, you know, I think a lot of people are familiar with MapleStory, so

1740
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,520
for the DS that would be pretty cool.

1741
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,800
And then I guess Live is doing something for their 5th anniversary starting November 15th.

1742
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,400
Lots of parties online.

1743
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Uno for everybody.

1744
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,880
Well, you know, that's interesting because that's starting on Wednesday.

1745
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,320
I wonder if they got any really kick-ass Xbox Live arcade games for that day.

1746
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,240
They haven't said what's coming out this week, have they?

1747
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,240
No, not yet.

1748
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,700
Maybe they're sitting on something good.

1749
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,680
What are some really like highly anticipated games we haven't got yet?

1750
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,680
Rez?

1751
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,680
Rez would be fucking awesome.

1752
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,680
Yeah, that's true.

1753
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,680
It could be that.

1754
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:10,680
Hell no.

1755
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,680
Oh, the hella famous shooter, Treasure.

1756
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,680
Omega 5?

1757
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,680
Omega 5?

1758
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,680
No, the one that's...

1759
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:17,680
Igaruga?

1760
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,680
Radiant Silver Gun.

1761
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,680
Igaruga is the one that...

1762
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,680
Igaruga.

1763
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,680
Yeah.

1764
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,040
But Omega 5, they've been pimping that out for a while now.

1765
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,480
That'd be kind of cool.

1766
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,200
Well, the party starts on Microsoft this week.

1767
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,520
I thought Screw Jumper was coming out.

1768
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,160
Did that already come out, Screw Jumper?

1769
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,600
Oh, I think they have confirmed that is this week's title, Screw Jumper, but there could

1770
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
be a second one that's really cool.

1771
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:35,600
Yeah, there could be a second one.

1772
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,600
Screw Jumper looks stupid.

1773
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:37,600
It might be okay.

1774
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,600
It might be okay.

1775
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,600
All right.

1776
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,080
Well, if that's it for Last Minute Stories, then we're going to go around and wrap up

1777
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,520
this show by going around and getting everybody's final thought.

1778
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,960
DarkSakura, thank you as always for blessing us with your presence.

1779
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,960
What's your final thought?

1780
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:54,080
My final thought is I can't find where I can save this wallpaper to so that I can make

1781
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,320
it fit my desktop.

1782
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,840
And I'll thank myself for blessing the show with my presence, and my final thought is

1783
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,400
I want enchiladas really bad, because looking at this Aldoberto's mug makes me crave horchata's.

1784
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,880
Loki, thank you as always for being here, and what's your final thought?

1785
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,520
Final thought is there's plenty of games for me to play this week.

1786
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,520
All right.

1787
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
Sounds good.

1788
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,520
Lots of stuff to play.

1789
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,280
If only there were like 30 hours in the day as opposed to 24.

1790
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,040
I'm glad I've made special arrangements for my consoles early on.

1791
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,920
All right, folks, that's... Oh, what?

1792
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,920
My PC is still down, so did I pump up the volume for the immediate future?

1793
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,920
Yeah.

1794
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,480
The only weekly shows we have going regularly right now are Thursday night, DMN is still

1795
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:38,800
doing the Insanest Hour, and Saturday I believe Travis Donovan is back up and running after

1796
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,120
a little bit of a summer hiatus.

1797
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,860
I know he had a show this week.

1798
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:46,500
So hopefully by the new year we'll be up and running with lots of shows.

1799
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,520
We are in talks to do some stuff, so we'll get back to you with that.

1800
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:57,200
And just also the FYI, next week, week after I will not be here.

1801
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,200
Cry.

1802
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,460
And the week after that.

1803
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,920
You may get the... Well, one of those weeks-

1804
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,920
I'll be in Alabama.

1805
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,920
We're not going to be here at all.

1806
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:03,920
Yeah.

1807
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:04,920
We're going to take a break from the show.

1808
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,520
I believe the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I think we agreed we can just not have a show

1809
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,520
that week.

1810
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,840
Although that's going to be a big gaming week with Rock Band and everything.

1811
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,560
I think we'll live if we take a week off.

1812
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,720
Well, hopefully we'll talk about that earlier.

1813
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:15,720
We'll see.

1814
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,720
I'm crossing my fingers.

1815
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,400
But you can get the Loki and Rob show the week after.

1816
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,360
We'll hold down the fort, even though Dark Soccer will be on a plane back from Alabama.

1817
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,880
I'll be fine to go that Sunday anyways.

1818
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,880
No, we'll see.

1819
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:26,880
Maybe we'll do.

1820
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:27,880
We haven't decided yet.

1821
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,880
I don't know.

1822
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,880
We could use a break though.

1823
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,480
I take that time during Thanksgiving to travel somewhere, so I kind of want to go back to

1824
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,480
Magic Mountain.

1825
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,480
We'll see.

1826
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,480
I've got to find somebody to go with me though.

1827
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,280
Hopefully it hasn't burned down yet.

1828
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:39,280
Hope not.

1829
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:40,280
Hope not.

1830
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,280
All right.

1831
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,280
Well, that's it.

1832
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,120
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting and

1833
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,120
independent radio.

1834
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,120
We've said that a lot tonight.

1835
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:51,360
Again, if you guys like what you hear, or even if you don't like what you hear, please

1836
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,660
still help us out by telling two people you know about the program.

1837
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:58,240
If you can't think of anybody to tell, then spread the word on the internet.

1838
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,600
You can do that through iTunes by leaving us a positive reviewer or one of those many,

1839
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,360
many sites like Podcast Alley, Yahoo Podcasts, Digg, whatever the hell.

1840
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,720
Just help us spread the word.

1841
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,720
We really appreciate it.

1842
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:09,920
You guys are awesome.

1843
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,940
Until next time, my name is Rob Roberts.

1844
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,940
That is Loki.

1845
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:15,940
She is Dark Sakura.

1846
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:19,160
And together, we are not Captain Planet.

1847
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,620
No, we are not Captain Planet, but we are Orange Lounge Radio.

1848
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:43,780
So take care, and we'll see you next week.

1849
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:54,620
Bye.
