00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:25,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 18th, 2007, Xbox 360 is getting its own virtual console of sorts, DivX is coming to PlayStation 3, and is the Nintendo DS redesigned on its way next year?

2
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:35,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:41,371
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:42,572
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:48,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, the co-host that make this shiz happen, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:51,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob gave me chocolate that has booze in it.

7
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:57,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it, but they didn't card me for it, so the alcohol is presumably cooked out.

8
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:00,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure of it, but I still think that it's very, very tasty.

9
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:02,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had some that has lots of alcohol in it, though.

10
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:03,007
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

11
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:03,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that.

12
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:09,309
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones that had the Grand Marnier in it, and they also had Johnny Walker.

13
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard of this.

14
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to find out where Julie got them from, but they do card you for those.

15
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:15,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should do that now.

16
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:17,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can get them at BevMo.

17
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:18,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you could.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,000
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well to the one and only Loki.

20
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:22,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

21
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:24,063
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay other than a headache.

23
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:27,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

24
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:28,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear you have a headache.

25
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need some Tylenol?

26
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:30,829
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I already took some.

27
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:31,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Profen?

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Hammer?

29
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I already took stuff.

30
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:33,991
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

31
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:39,756
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, for the lovely folks watching our webcam feed on Operator 11, you can see Loki's shirt.

32
00:01:39,896 --> 00:01:40,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you get this at Fonamay?

33
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:42,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got this at Fonamay.

34
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:45,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Amish, Penn State, Dutch.

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely.

37
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:47,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice shirt.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,181
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

39
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,058
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

40
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:48,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan came too, and we played a bunch of ticket games at that John's Not Very Amazing Pizza It's John's Incredible Pizza, but we now call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza I can't see the name of it, but it's the new Afterburner that came out like, what, a year ago?

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:58,066
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked pretty rad, I didn't even know it was there Oh, it's really, really cool, and we played like a bunch of that And I went on this Twister thing Oh my god, William was so funny

42
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:06,115
[SPEAKER_03]: and a big hello to the person that worked there, Chris, who stopped us and was like, you're the guys from Original Radio, huh?

43
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:07,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was kind of cool.

44
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I need to write this thing first.

45
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:10,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Ego++.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,360
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Level up.

48
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:15,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got recognized from the show by some guy who worked there.

49
00:03:15,624 --> 00:03:16,344
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty awesome.

50
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So he recognized me because DarkSakura was on the ride and then I was like, oh, you gotta go meet Jamie's mom.

51
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:22,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's never on camera anyways.

52
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:22,610
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

53
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,731
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not on Op 11, so they don't know what you look like.

54
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,513
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's in the album art, so I'm sure if

55
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:27,894
[SPEAKER_03]: If they've done their homework, they know.

56
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,275
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's on the All Games page.

57
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:30,175
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a picture and all that stuff.

58
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:31,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've got pictures of me on my MySpace.

59
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.

60
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:36,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I take them with my own camera of myself.

61
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly, I was not able to get free things from the ticket counter.

62
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:47,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Because William wanted one of those, it was something really fruity, like a princess backpack or something stupid just to make me buy it for him.

63
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:51,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was so much that he probably wanted it, but he wanted me to buy it for him.

64
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted the Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

65
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:54,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were cool.

66
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:58,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted the little mini pinball game, because I'm not cool like Jamie, and I have like 20 pinball machines in my house.

67
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, we traded out one of our pinballs.

68
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,272
[SPEAKER_07]: We're actually holding some pinball machines for a friend.

69
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:06,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we got rid of Time Machine, which made me sad, but we have a Black Knight now.

70
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:07,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, rad.

71
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:09,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Not Black Knight 2000, but the old Black Knight.

72
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:09,678
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.

73
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:10,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is still a cool table.

74
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:10,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

75
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

76
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:12,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

77
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:21,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm posting a link in the chat room right now, which apparently I noticed my t-shirt had a web URL on it.

78
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where you can find it.

79
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go through a few links.

80
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:33,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But this guy has some other wonderful shirts, including one that's a spoof of the Clerks shirt, or I guess box art from the movie, Clerics.

81
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.

82
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a lot more Ragnarok of course

83
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:12,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a really nice game of World Cup Soccer, 94, which was a very, very good game.

84
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:19,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually watched the entire playthrough of Portal just because I watched it twice.

85
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the cake ever come true?

86
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:23,631
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

87
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:24,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

88
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:26,092
[SPEAKER_07]: But

89
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:44,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I also, after the show when I got home last week, because I had a three day weekend, because I work for a bank, I was really bored and had bad insomnia, so I completely redid my live journal, and I now have a portal theme.

90
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:46,446
[SPEAKER_03]: with a companion cube on it.

91
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:48,207
[SPEAKER_07]: With a big old weighted companion cube on it.

92
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I did watch the YouTube of the poor companion.

93
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,189
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a companion cube tribute on YouTube.

94
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was... People have the dumbest shit on YouTube.

95
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,210
[SPEAKER_03]: You were laughing though.

96
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,610
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was.

97
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It was funny.

98
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,391
[SPEAKER_07]: That one part though where they played the... You must now incinerate the cube or whatever.

99
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:02,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, didn't they?

100
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:03,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

101
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:09,414
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they played the one image in heap song that they always play for like every death scene ever that I've ever seen.

102
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:10,214
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.

103
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so like the video is like...

104
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,312
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's doing its thing and it's showing, like, it's like a tribute.

105
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:19,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, I was expecting Journey to come in or something.

106
00:06:19,475 --> 00:06:23,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, like, you know, they have to throw the cube in the incinerator because that's what you do in one of the missions.

107
00:06:23,778 --> 00:06:26,761
[SPEAKER_03]: And then suddenly, you know, the definitive death song comes in.

108
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:33,967
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not the companion cube.

109
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:39,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they kept repeating it and speeding it up.

110
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,452
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the best ever.

111
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:46,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it, I tried.

112
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:47,974
[SPEAKER_02]: iTunes just isn't friendly to do that.

113
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like that one SNL digital short that they have.

114
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:50,177
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

115
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:51,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a total parody of that one short.

116
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:53,623
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just the best thing ever.

117
00:06:55,865 --> 00:07:00,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Sister, thank you, TigerClaw, in the chat room, chat.northshelter.com.

118
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:16,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to find the walkthrough I was watching, but I was watching part seven of the walkthrough, because that's my favorite one, because that's the one where the computer starts going nuts and says, you know, you must lay down in the party retrieval position.

119
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

120
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we gotta move on.

121
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:21,291
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a portal show tonight.

122
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

123
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:24,653
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was okay.

124
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Earth Defense Force 2017 again.

125
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:34,756
[SPEAKER_02]: We went back to that and actually did pretty well on the Inferno levels.

126
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully gonna try to finish that game eventually.

127
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:44,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried a little bit of Mass Effect and there's a whole lot of talking in that game.

128
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:49,547
[SPEAKER_02]: They really like to just, you know, use that.

129
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:53,029
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, man, we made a really cool conversation system.

130
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's constantly use it.

131
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, my God, shut the hell up.

132
00:07:58,153 --> 00:07:59,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go on a mission already.

133
00:08:00,174 --> 00:08:02,015
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the best game reviews, Loki.

134
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:06,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I play Mass Effect and it's a lot of talking.

135
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:08,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It seriously is.

136
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,438
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

137
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

138
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:19,662
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here for some reason that's not, you know, good or something, and there's something going on.

139
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:20,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what it is.

140
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:24,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And, like, to this point, I'm like, I don't know who you are, nor do I care what's going on.

141
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to go fight something.

142
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:32,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when I did go fight something, there were these stupid little flying things that shot lasers at me, and...

143
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:47,823
[SPEAKER_02]: My guys basically... I had one of my away team members that must have been Sergeant I'm Gonna Die or something because fucker just ran up, started shooting at it, and just stood out in the middle of the open instead of taking cover like a smart person and died instantly.

144
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Naturally, there's feedback from the chat room here.

145
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:55,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 says, Dear God, an RPG where I have to talk to people?

146
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:56,227
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

147
00:08:56,407 --> 00:09:00,008
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but they go on and on and on and on and on.

148
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually was skimming through it.

149
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

150
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:08,204
[SPEAKER_02]: If I wanted to talk to everybody, I could do that as well, and it's just, huh.

151
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:12,705
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt in chat.orange.studio.com says, They spend a lot on voice actors, Loki.

152
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:13,345
[SPEAKER_03]: They gotta use them.

153
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:14,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, true.

154
00:09:14,806 --> 00:09:15,746
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, don't get me wrong.

155
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:19,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaker Uno invokes Elvis and says, A little more conversation.

156
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, a little less conversation.

157
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:22,469
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more action, please.

158
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:22,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

159
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:23,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Get it?

160
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:29,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but, you know, to be fair... Okay, to be fair, I played this game, you know, during a lunch, okay?

161
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and only half of a lunch, so about 30 minutes.

162
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:36,796
[SPEAKER_02]: But, dude, it took me 25 minutes to actually see some action in this game.

163
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's pretty bad.

164
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:40,657
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, hey, it's gonna be pretty cool.

165
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:51,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm looking forward to playing a little bit more of the game when I stop playing other games, which one of those other games, of course, would be Rock Band.

166
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know...

167
00:09:54,173 --> 00:10:02,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to sound like a fanboy for Rock Band, because I don't really play... I bought Guitar Hero 2 a long time ago and didn't play that much of it.

168
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band, though, has actually got me excited about music games again.

169
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:08,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's, you know, worth playing.

170
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:09,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

171
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty fun.

172
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,159
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big fucking statement there.

173
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm actually working my way through the game on, you know, starting on Easy and then, you know, kind of building up from there.

174
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:19,402
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

175
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:20,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

176
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually playing on that one time.

177
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:52,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, the drums are good, although I cannot play drums in the house anymore because my wife has told me not to because it's too loud.

178
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,931
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very loud, those drums.

179
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's fun.

180
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:57,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the drums in the game.

181
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:03,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not touched the vocal part of the game yet, but the microphone that comes with it is really nice.

182
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:08,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear, though, you can use any USB microphone and it'll work just fine.

183
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:13,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I hear the rumor about the Guitar Hero 3 controllers not working in the game is false.

184
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:15,005
[SPEAKER_02]: They do work in the game.

185
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:15,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

186
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:17,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

187
00:11:17,806 --> 00:11:21,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, that's what they were using for the demo unit at the Best Buy near my house.

188
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:22,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

189
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:23,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

190
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:23,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

191
00:11:24,324 --> 00:11:27,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I had known I had seen them before somewhere, and I didn't remember.

192
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,788
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the guitars that came with the Rock Band game.

193
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:30,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were nice guitars.

194
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:30,809
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nice.

195
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:31,830
[SPEAKER_02]: They are really nice.

196
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the drums are pretty cool.

197
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:36,453
[SPEAKER_02]: They get put together pretty fast.

198
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's okay.

199
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:43,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still having trouble coordinating both drums and the kick drum, but I have that problem with...

200
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:45,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Drum Mania

201
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:11,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

202
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:41,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a good 20 pounds when it's full of all the equipment.

203
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big, big box, and it's not even full right now.

204
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:45,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense, though.

205
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:45,923
Yeah, I know.

206
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:58,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, the other bad thing about it, and I had to cut a hole in the side of the box, because right now I'm using up the carry stuff back and forth, is once you put the guitar together, because the little top part kind of snaps on, it doesn't fit in the box anymore.

207
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:00,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to cut a hole in the box for the guitar.

208
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so yeah, you can create your own characters.

209
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:09,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually created an emo goth guy called Azrael for my guitarist.

210
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:10,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Azrael Abyss!

211
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:17,512
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was trying to do, but you couldn't fit Azrael Abyss, Prince of Sorrow in there, so I just had to stick with Azrael.

212
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:18,393
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great!

213
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:20,654
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool, though.

214
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:24,998
[SPEAKER_02]: He looks, I don't know, kind of neat now.

215
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:28,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Then my main character, Loki, who's playing drums...

216
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:31,613
[SPEAKER_02]: has the Doctor Who jacket, which is kind of neat.

217
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:34,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I don't know.

218
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,416
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things.

219
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:40,297
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the guitars in the game is actually a chainsaw, which is kind of neat.

220
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:47,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can create probably a lot of characters that look like Sephiroth or Vincent and stuff.

221
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot of outfits that look like you could make characters look like other things.

222
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:57,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved the way that the custom characters interface themselves so well into the flow of the game.

223
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:00,662
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually... They look like they're in pre-rendered movies.

224
00:14:00,862 --> 00:14:06,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they actually, in the game, their mouths are synced up with the lyrics and everything.

225
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:09,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Their playing is synced up with the song.

226
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not just like fake strumming of the guitar and stuff.

227
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually synced up with the song.

228
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And the drummer actually drums to the song.

229
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty realistic.

230
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:20,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I like...

231
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:23,887
[SPEAKER_02]: The film, you know, graines on it.

232
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:43,160
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is funny, though, watching this really emo-looking guy singing Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.

233
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Timmy, Timmy!

234
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:46,903
[SPEAKER_02]: For East Pop Song, A++.

235
00:14:47,564 --> 00:14:49,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a pretty cool game.

236
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:50,987
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock the tracks pretty easy, too.

237
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:55,591
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a bonus little venue that you play that unlocks all the unlockable tracks.

238
00:14:55,991 --> 00:15:01,015
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order to be able to play the songs in practice mode or whatever, you have to play them through the game.

239
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's pretty nice, but...

240
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I really recommend picking it up if you can find it.

241
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know they're going to be really hard to find.

242
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:20,077
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can't find the game with all the instruments and you don't really care about drums too much, you can always pick up a USB microphone and just use your normal Guitar Hero guitar with the game only and save yourself some money that way.

243
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:21,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you right now where to get Rock Band.

244
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:24,340
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go there the morning of the 20th when it comes out, right?

245
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Tuesday when it comes out?

246
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:26,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Morning of the 20th?

247
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:27,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Kmart.

248
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:28,243
[SPEAKER_03]: No one shops Kmart.

249
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,405
[SPEAKER_02]: They might not be getting that many, though.

250
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,206
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the thing.

251
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:33,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Get there first.

252
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's allocations are cut, so go to Best Buy or something like that if you can.

253
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:39,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else for your gaming week?

254
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... No.

255
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,564
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week, not too incredibly exciting because I've been going back and forth between Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft.

256
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:51,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing both.

257
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my Corsair up to level 19 in Final Fantasy XI.

258
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:54,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh...

259
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:57,924
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft 2.3

260
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:16,724
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

261
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of how dancers are in Ragnarok

262
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:57,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I think in the... Well, no, because in Tactics they were just female bards.

263
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:58,848
[SPEAKER_03]: They were more buffers.

264
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:03,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, they do more buffing, but they have range healing and stuff like that.

265
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:11,434
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly how they made them in Final Fantasy XI, is that they're kind of like buffers, but with that range healing, but yet they can provoke the monster, and they're like tanks.

266
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:12,354
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

267
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:14,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they dance fight?

268
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:15,865
[SPEAKER_06]: They just shake their ass.

269
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:18,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you can be a Galka dancer.

270
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,725
[SPEAKER_03]: There's videos on YouTube of the Galka dances.

271
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:21,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

272
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:29,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You use your TP to do attacks, but the thing is it's like the first job I can think of where you don't have to have 100% TP to do the special attacks.

273
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:31,907
[SPEAKER_03]: There's things you can do with like 30 TP or 60.

274
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:34,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And TP is the stuff you build up as you attack.

275
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:35,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It's toilet paper.

276
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:36,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that kind of TP.

277
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:37,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for your bunghole.

278
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:39,669
[SPEAKER_07]: You throw your toilet paper at them.

279
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

280
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was... But then they do little jigs.

281
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

282
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I also forgot, if you don't mind.

283
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:44,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

284
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:46,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I did make the guild for Ragnarok.

285
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:50,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to congratulate Ranma as being our first member.

286
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats.

287
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you... The guild is just Orange Lounge Radio.

288
00:17:58,756 --> 00:17:59,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

289
00:17:59,276 --> 00:18:00,056
[SPEAKER_07]: So look for the icon.

290
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:00,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that out.

291
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:01,837
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

292
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:05,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to show you the YouTube-age of the Galka dances later.

293
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:05,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to see that.

294
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:10,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Op 11 is slowing down our stream a little bit because we're doing too much bandwidth.

295
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:11,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't handle it.

296
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:12,643
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I play?

297
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quickly, I played that new word-searching game on Xbox 360, just the demo.

298
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:21,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little disappointed that it's just basically an over-glorified word-search game.

299
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:25,331
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of seems like a casual game, something that Mom might like.

300
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:25,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

301
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:30,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Mutant Storm Empire, though, much improved over the first Mutant Storm.

302
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I need to go back and buy that one.

303
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:46,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the greatest change they made to it is that they made levels feel more like levels, where it's almost like Smash TV, kind of, where you're walking through from room to room, and it doesn't have that really slow loading time transition between the different rooms.

304
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you now buy the, or not buy, but download the free Casserone?

305
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Carcassone?

306
00:18:52,296 --> 00:18:54,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Casserone is something you cook for dinner, I think.

307
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:55,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Casserole!

308
00:18:55,117 --> 00:18:55,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Casserole.

309
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:57,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Carcassonne, I already had it.

310
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:58,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Calzone?

311
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I got ripped off.

312
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:07,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I already bought Carcassonne like two weeks ago, or not two weeks ago, like two months ago when it was, not when it was first out, but about a month after it was first out, I bought Carcassonne.

313
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:11,105
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was kind of pissed when I heard that it was out for free.

314
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:11,785
[SPEAKER_03]: But what can you do?

315
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:12,886
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of stuff happens.

316
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:15,387
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.

317
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:19,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Pete Caruno played Screwjumper and said it sucks balls.

318
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:23,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, this week's releases kind of suck balls.

319
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: All I heard is that Picaruno beat my Boom Boom Rocket score, so I know what game I've got to play this week.

320
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe, maybe I will use the guitar.

321
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:32,007
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what we have to do, Rob?

322
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:34,348
[SPEAKER_07]: What we didn't do last week?

323
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:34,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Metroid!

324
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:36,189
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't done it in the past three months.

325
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:41,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm leaving on Thursday, so we'll have to do it early this week.

326
00:19:41,252 --> 00:19:41,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Soon?

327
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:46,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't work Thursday and Friday, thankfully, but you're like, oh, I'm going to leave because I can't.

328
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:49,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm leaving midnight, like when it turns midnight.

329
00:19:49,196 --> 00:19:49,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

330
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we'll have to do it on Tuesday.

331
00:19:53,003 --> 00:19:53,724
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

332
00:19:54,524 --> 00:19:56,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's get into some housekeeping.

333
00:19:56,645 --> 00:20:03,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Jamie leaving, Jamie will be on vacation for the next two weeks from the show, so she's not going to be here next week or the week after.

334
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:04,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Cry.

335
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,710
[SPEAKER_03]: How dare she?

336
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe she'll... But, Rob.

337
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:07,611
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

338
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:08,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Fried chicken.

339
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe she'll bless us with her presence via the telephone.

340
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:11,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

341
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:11,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

342
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:12,674
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

343
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:15,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, monkeys might... Never mind.

344
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:20,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we'll have somebody else here or if it'll just be the Loki and Rob show.

345
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:26,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to reach out to Rice Princess so we can have a female perspective of Jamie's absence, but I don't know if she can make it.

346
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have you know, Rob, the Wii Zapper comes out next week.

347
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:30,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have one.

348
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:32,494
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you do that already?

349
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:36,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Freebies from the Game Crazy Manager thing.

350
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:37,476
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that work?

351
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:38,677
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we have that uses it?

352
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:40,758
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have one!

353
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,083
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a Wii Zapper.

354
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:43,783
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

355
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,984
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's Link's crossbow training.

356
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, but I didn't care about that.

357
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:53,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, the great Loki and Rob challenge with the Wii Zapper might go down.

358
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:56,451
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have Nellie come on the show.

359
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:58,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, she doesn't want to.

360
00:20:58,532 --> 00:20:58,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps.

361
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:00,553
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got to watch Cesper Housewives.

362
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:01,173
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll bribe her.

363
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: What few episodes are left while the Writers Guild's striking?

364
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:09,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I told Dan to come on the show with me after I get back.

365
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:09,879
[SPEAKER_07]: You should.

366
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:10,159
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.

367
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan on the show is... Comedy.

368
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:15,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's hilarity.

369
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza was pretty funny.

370
00:21:18,763 --> 00:21:21,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, didn't he coin the phrase John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

371
00:21:21,586 --> 00:21:22,127
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was me.

372
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:23,749
[SPEAKER_03]: He had another term for it.

373
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Incredibly Sucky Pizza.

374
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, John's Incredible World of Suck or something.

375
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:29,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway.

376
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:32,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Our poor friend who works there.

377
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio Gamer Pick

378
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:47,926
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

379
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:07,693
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

380
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:35,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

381
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:36,024
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

382
00:22:50,863 --> 00:23:08,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Might I also add, there is lots of other great podcasts in Community Gamer Picks 1, and hopefully someday there'll be a Community Gamer Picks 3, but more of you guys have to download them and use them, and then they go, oh, people like this stuff, so we should get more blogs and more indie shows and that stuff in there.

383
00:23:08,478 --> 00:23:10,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very cool.

384
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:17,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, after tonight's show, I think I already mentioned this, on Operator 11, a special live preview for Rock Band.

385
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:24,711
[SPEAKER_03]: And last week we did one for Mario Galaxy, and the folks in chat really seemed to like that, and it was very well received.

386
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:29,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping we can do more of these in the future, in these live preview shows on Sundays, and other Op 11 specials.

387
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:30,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

388
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:32,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, DrunkShow

389
00:23:59,497 --> 00:24:02,439
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because I have to work the Monday after the four-day weekend, so not likely.

390
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:03,040
[SPEAKER_03]: But you never know.

391
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to the station.

392
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:07,463
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know when we'll go live randomly.

393
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:09,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

394
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:10,265
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we have?

395
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:11,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was another one I wanted to see.

396
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:13,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Gerardimo says, Can Loki sing in the preview?

397
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:15,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

398
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:16,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

399
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:17,149
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to bribe him.

400
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Loki.

401
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:18,971
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

402
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you at least read us some news in a Tingle outfit?

403
00:24:24,474 --> 00:24:24,734
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

404
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,355
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

405
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you at least read us some news?

406
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

407
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:28,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

408
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:34,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a big announcement about the fall update, or winter update, I guess now.

409
00:24:36,983 --> 00:24:43,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it kind of leaked out first that the Xbox Originals are going to be made available to download.

410
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:51,187
[SPEAKER_02]: What those are basically going to be is just a selection of original Xbox games that you can download straight to your hard drive and play.

411
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:56,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is actually going to be happening, it has been confirmed, and...

412
00:24:56,673 --> 00:24:58,054
[SPEAKER_02]: HALO, PSYCHONAUTS, KRIMSOM SKIES, FABLE

413
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:37,031
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some other third-party ones that were also reported, which were Indigo Prophecy, Crash Bandicoot, Wrath of the Cortex, and Burnout 3 Takedown, which I thought was a pretty good Burnout game.

414
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:39,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

415
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:47,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, as part of the follow-up, they have, of course, that parental timer, and then who knows what else they'll throw in there as well.

416
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,376
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's mainly the big thing.

417
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:51,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, if you're expecting, you know,

418
00:25:52,193 --> 00:25:54,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Some wonderful things from these Xbox originals.

419
00:25:56,334 --> 00:26:03,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to kind of calm down a little bit because they're really just downloadable Xbox games.

420
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:03,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

421
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:09,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're emulated through the same software that emulates the current Xbox games that you can just pop a disc in there.

422
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:16,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the bugs that were in those emulations are going to be the same thing on these download titles.

423
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:21,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, if you thought Microsoft was going to take the virtual console idea and do it better...

424
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:22,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrong.

425
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:23,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

426
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:28,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know, they're going to have choppiness when the game's loading up.

427
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if there's content like demos and stuff, selecting them might actually crash the game.

428
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:37,527
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stuff that's on these original Xbox games.

429
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:41,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really just straight port, and they're just available to download.

430
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:44,069
[SPEAKER_02]: No achievements, no nothing.

431
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.

432
00:26:45,749 --> 00:26:47,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of a big deal.

433
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:48,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

434
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool news for people that maybe missed it, because there's some people who didn't buy an Xbox One who have an Xbox 360, you know what I mean?

435
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:57,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be good for them.

436
00:26:57,305 --> 00:27:00,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if you're up to it, they will be made available.

437
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, this is an optional purchase.

438
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:07,372
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily need to buy it, but I don't know.

439
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,989
[SPEAKER_03]: VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV VX, Jason, XV

440
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:40,134
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I probably wouldn't buy these things if I still have the discs sitting around.

441
00:27:40,554 --> 00:27:43,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, and the other thing too is, I mean, some of these games are pretty old.

442
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:46,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can probably find them really cheap if you really want to look for them.

443
00:27:46,858 --> 00:28:01,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will be incentive, if they make money off this, maybe this will be incentive for them to go back to the, in the Xbox archive and make, because they haven't touched the backwards compatibility in a long time and made some more games like backwards compatible, like DDR, like still not backwards compatible, right?

444
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:05,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will be incentive for them to go dip in the library and make some old stuff backwards compatible.

445
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:11,662
[SPEAKER_03]: But I swear to God, if they make things like Silent Hill 2 and Silent... Was Silent Hill 3 on Xbox?

446
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:12,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was.

447
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:14,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I only had 2 and 4, so I don't know.

448
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:16,146
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think it was.

449
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:18,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing it on PS2.

450
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:25,473
[SPEAKER_03]: But my copies have vanished probably when I moved, so I would download that shit in a heartbeat just to have the load times and stuff.

451
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:27,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that stuff's going to be cool, I think.

452
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:28,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

453
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:35,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to mention during housekeeping that I totally forgot because we forgot to note it on our little notes thingy.

454
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:55,196
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great what's been released from our community and it's on the forums and it's something called OL Revolution and it's basically a Stepmania pack with all these songs that are based on like inside jokes from the show and there's some completely horrid stuff in there like

455
00:28:56,187 --> 00:29:05,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Like five years ago when we would go on the stream randomly and I would sing over DDR songs, like people recorded that shit somehow and have stepped it.

456
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:14,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those like god-awful DMN remixes that he's taken, and I say that with love, that he's taken like bits and pieces of our show and put them over DDR songs, they're like all in there with steps.

457
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:20,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like things that are in jokes to like other shows on the station, like just hilarious.

458
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:22,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all in the forums.

459
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:24,297
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

460
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:58,371
[SPEAKER_03]: But I swear to God, if that shit gets out, that karaoke stuff gets out there too much, I'm going to have issues.

461
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,634
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have words, Dark Tetsuya, in the parking lot.

462
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:05,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll kick your butt in Rock Band, which we were talking about a little earlier in the game.

463
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:12,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of news coming out on Rock Band as the game gets closer and closer to release, including information about the download packs.

464
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:19,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rock Band has decided they've got to stick it to Guitar Hero 3 by making the packs a little bit cheaper.

465
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:23,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of 500 points for Guitar Hero 3 packs, 440 Microsoft points.

466
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:25,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That equates to, do the math in your head,

467
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: $5.49.

468
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't just have to buy songs in packs.

469
00:30:31,681 --> 00:30:33,502
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy individual songs.

470
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:38,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It could go anywhere from 80 Microsoft points to 240 Microsoft points.

471
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:40,444
[SPEAKER_03]: That's $0.99 to just under $3.

472
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:45,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them, they say, will be $1.99, 159 Microsoft points.

473
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, 159 Microsoft points.

474
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:51,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have all these leftover stupid points somewhere.

475
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:52,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do like...

476
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:58,307
[SPEAKER_03]: 160.

477
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,307
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, they have so much stuff coming out just when the game comes out.

478
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:08,190
[SPEAKER_03]: They have on November 20th, the Metallica Pack, the Police Pack, the Queens of the Stone Age Pack, and some individual tracks such as My Sharona and Cherry Bomb.

479
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:15,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like to point out that the week of November 27th, while Jamie is gone and she can't play it, there's a David Bowie pack coming out.

480
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:15,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha.

481
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:17,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Who says I can't play it?

482
00:31:17,372 --> 00:31:19,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to have Rock Band in Alabama?

483
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:21,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha.

484
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:22,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I want to get back.

485
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Sabbath Pack comes out on December 4th.

486
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:27,982
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so getting downloaded.

487
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:33,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And December 18th, look at this, some individual tracks.

488
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:43,406
[SPEAKER_03]: First you get a Pretender song, Brass in Pocket, Weezer, Buddy Holly, and just for you, DarkSakura, God is Listening, My Iron Lung by Radiohead on December 18th.

489
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:44,406
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

490
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:45,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I loves me some Radiohead.

491
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:48,748
[SPEAKER_02]: But see, it's kind of cool that they have stuff coming out each week.

492
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:50,168
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very cool.

493
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:51,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it continues.

494
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:53,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we get stuff on Christmas.

495
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:54,492
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

496
00:31:56,113 --> 00:31:56,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

497
00:31:56,593 --> 00:31:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to buy some of these.

498
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:00,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunate Son actually sounded kind of cool.

499
00:32:01,196 --> 00:32:04,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the fact that they have some individual pricing to it as well.

500
00:32:04,378 --> 00:32:04,978
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very cool.

501
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not all this I'm going to want to buy.

502
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,682
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm very happy.

503
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:20,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for anyone who is looking for these on Guitar Hero 3, there is a free Boss Battle download pack that's basically...

504
00:32:21,391 --> 00:32:27,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Just the devil went down to Georgia and all the other three boss battle songs, so that's pretty cool.

505
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:31,258
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that the best part about it is that it's free.

506
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:32,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I like free.

507
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Free is good.

508
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,861
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can play these outside of career mode.

509
00:32:36,802 --> 00:32:37,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

510
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:40,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, something not... Wait, wait, wait.

511
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:43,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I ran out real quick, but I wanted to comment on that.

512
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:43,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It...

513
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:51,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they did it for free because otherwise we all would have been screaming that it was pay-to-unlock content because those songs were kind of already in the game.

514
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,592
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's a nice little extra.

515
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:55,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing huge.

516
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:59,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But The Devil Went Down to Georgia is an awesome song, so I'm really glad they made that available to play whenever I want.

517
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:00,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that cover.

518
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:01,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so good jobs.

519
00:33:02,077 --> 00:33:02,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now, Loki, you can go.

520
00:33:03,706 --> 00:33:17,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so UK retailer Tesco actually slipped up because on their online store they were selling the Xbox 360 Hollative Bundle, which is normally 340 pounds.

521
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,231
[SPEAKER_02]: They were selling it for only 33 pounds.

522
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:23,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoopsie!

523
00:33:24,612 --> 00:33:30,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently it was long enough for a number of customers to order the system and

524
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:40,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Sky News is saying that once the payment is accepted, trading standards rules in the UK state that the retailer must comply and deliver the product.

525
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:56,753
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they have said, despite the rules, Tesco site maintains that they do not have to conform to erroneously marked prices unless they fail to notice before shipment.

526
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,394
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to cause a stink.

527
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:09,204
[SPEAKER_02]: but there was apparently some consumers like one that ordered 39 consoles although none of them have been delivered yet.

528
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,205
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd have to do at least a full refund on price.

529
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:18,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, especially like, you know, you consider that guy probably thought he was doing a smart thing.

530
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:23,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they won't try to like charge him for all those Xbox 360s or he's not going to be happy.

531
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:25,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they can do that.

532
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:26,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

533
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:27,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

534
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:29,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point out

535
00:34:30,094 --> 00:34:38,220
[SPEAKER_03]: In response to the last story, because there's a bit of a delay from when we say it to when the live listeners hear it, Actdeft says, Free is good, except for Yaris.

536
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:40,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

537
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:44,885
[SPEAKER_07]: You do pay in time, don't you?

538
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:51,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more Rock Band stuff, and this is not going to be free, sadly, but this sounds like really cool.

539
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:59,396
[SPEAKER_03]: This came from an interview with the official Xbox magazine, and some more details have surfaced from Harmonix about Rock Band, and apparently...

540
00:35:00,296 --> 00:35:03,697
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be able to take your band and export it to a webpage.

541
00:35:04,177 --> 00:35:14,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And from there, you can take band avatars, pose your band avatars, make album covers with your band logo, make all these different scenes, and then you can turn that into real world stuff.

542
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:25,122
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make figurines based on these rock band characters, t-shirts that have the fake album art on them, and then tour dates that are just basically the accomplishments from the game.

543
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,132
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

544
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:51,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still kind of neat.

545
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:55,048
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the Madden thing where you can buy a fucking ring for like $500.

546
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:56,209
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

547
00:35:56,249 --> 00:35:57,110
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little crazy.

548
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:04,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to see how this plays out because obviously it's not up there yet, but it must be coming soon because the game is out on Tuesday.

549
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:07,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say, though, there are some pretty interesting scenes.

550
00:36:07,637 --> 00:36:09,439
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some of the load screens on there.

551
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:17,124
[SPEAKER_02]: They will have fake album art and stuff like that and fake little portraits and stuff with your characters that you design in it.

552
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:21,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the trivia was interesting.

553
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:27,668
[SPEAKER_03]: We played the Freeze Pop song and it said something about Freeze Pop once got arrested in Canada and ate lots of poutine.

554
00:36:28,249 --> 00:36:31,830
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that's completely random.

555
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow.

556
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:37,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, do people outside of Canada even know what poutine is?

557
00:36:37,352 --> 00:36:37,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

558
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:38,632
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

559
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:39,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

560
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:40,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is.

561
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically french fries and gravy.

562
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,674
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds really yummy.

563
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:44,094
Fuck.

564
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:47,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Canadian friends online that blog about it.

565
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:48,754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good, apparently.

566
00:36:49,494 --> 00:36:49,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

567
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:51,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've got Canadian listeners.

568
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:54,916
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of do that with my leftover chips from the British food store.

569
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:56,517
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

570
00:36:57,117 --> 00:36:58,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I put chip shop curry on it.

571
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it this show always turns into the food show?

572
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:03,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're hungry.

573
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:05,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Does food and gaming go hand in hand like that?

574
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

575
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:06,820
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

576
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:07,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

577
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for other stuff, Rob, the

578
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:24,241
[SPEAKER_07]: For anyone who is familiar with Atlas USA, they are bringing out Spectral Force 3 and Operation Darkness for Xbox 360, which is pretty cool.

579
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:30,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Atlas gave us Trauma Center on Wii, so we are getting their new localizations.

580
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:37,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And they made the cute little tactical game with the voice acting on PS2.

581
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,394
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, why can't I think of it?

582
00:37:39,494 --> 00:37:41,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Really popular, just got a sequel recently.

583
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:42,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Disgaea.

584
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Disgaea.

585
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Disgaea, yeah.

586
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And Persona, they made that too.

587
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:46,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, and we like Persona.

588
00:37:47,114 --> 00:37:47,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they published it.

589
00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:49,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're getting more.

590
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, true, true.

591
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:52,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they're publishing, but yeah, we're getting more fun.

592
00:37:52,558 --> 00:37:53,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Big difference, my bad.

593
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,364
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was going to say that Operation Darkness looked like crap, by the way.

594
00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:04,609
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I don't know, it looked dumb from when I remember when they were first showing video of that.

595
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:08,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, so Lionhead...

596
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:12,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember them from the Fable series.

597
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:17,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're looking for some custom insults for Fable 2.

598
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:26,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually have a whole thing where you can submit your insults to them, and apparently if they like it, they will put it in the game.

599
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:29,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat.

600
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:32,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.

601
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Your gameplay makes me want to go play a PlayStation 3.

602
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:38,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that good?

603
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:39,087
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

604
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:39,167
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

605
00:38:39,972 --> 00:38:53,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the ones that they were saying that were on there already, Groin Crab, Loner McLonleyton, and Big Girls Blouse, which I don't understand that.

606
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:59,641
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think would happen if I submitted their names to call people?

607
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:08,667
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to be honest, all they need to do is monitor names and little catchphrases that are in Animal Crossing because, I mean, that's what people do anyway.

608
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:09,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good point.

609
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:13,431
[SPEAKER_03]: NintendoManiac64 in chat says, Sky, instead of PlayStation 3 on that console, try N-Gage.

610
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:14,431
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

611
00:39:14,672 --> 00:39:15,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn!

612
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:16,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.

613
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:24,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, as a joke, if you're supposed to submit things that are name-calling or whatever, let's all submit Bobby Blackwolf as a name-calling thing.

614
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:25,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny.

615
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:28,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding, Bobby, if you're listening.

616
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:28,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearts.

617
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:30,452
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

618
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:38,702
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that they don't want you putting your opinions in and don't want you asking about anymore is Bioshock on the PlayStation 3.

619
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:41,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it, Sony fanboys.

620
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:43,408
[SPEAKER_03]: 2K Games has given you the smackdown.

621
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:45,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not happening.

622
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an official response on the 2K forums.

623
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:54,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what the moderator had to say, quote, Please don't tell me you made an account just for this question.

624
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,242
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be no PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock.

625
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:59,824
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been explained time and time again.

626
00:40:01,285 --> 00:40:08,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were hoping to save some, what do they call them, little sisters on the PlayStation 3 version, not going to happen.

627
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:09,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, kids.

628
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Bioshock 2?

629
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:12,273
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

630
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know there's got to be a Bioshock 2 at some point.

631
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:19,057
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's getting amazing reviews, but Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3?

632
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if there's enough PlayStation 3s out there, they'll probably do it.

633
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's that.

634
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,701
[SPEAKER_03]: No Bioshock for you PlayStation 3 kids.

635
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,782
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but, but, we like... No!

636
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:29,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

637
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:30,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I said no!

638
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:35,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they are now putting out something very interesting for PlayStation 3.

639
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is very interesting.

640
00:40:38,427 --> 00:40:38,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

641
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:45,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Trend Micro Incorporated is putting out antivirus software for the Playstation 3.

642
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:45,472
[SPEAKER_07]: It's

643
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:58,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, that's sort of interesting, but they're saying that the home systems now are going to be vulnerable to spyware and viruses for being able to go on the internet.

644
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:01,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that so my PlayStation 3 doesn't get herpes?

645
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:10,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's antivirus software, but I think Trend Micro is doing the parental controls on the internet browser that they're going to add.

646
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:12,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've already added them with...

647
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:14,637
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

648
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:45,291
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

649
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:45,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

650
00:41:46,692 --> 00:41:47,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I got it for free.

651
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:01,837
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

652
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:28,467
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

653
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:03,780
[SPEAKER_03]: They come out for like one or two games, and then they're not continued to be supported, therefore the peripherals never sell.

654
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,561
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to make a ton of games for the peripherals in order for them to finally sell.

655
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:14,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, for example here, the Xbox Vision camera.

656
00:43:15,503 --> 00:43:15,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

657
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:24,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a piece of useless crap, and I'm sad to have made that mistake twice now with both the iToy and the Vision camera.

658
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:31,711
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's why I haven't bought a PlayStation Eye yet because I don't want to buy another useless camera.

659
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:34,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

660
00:43:34,973 --> 00:43:38,335
[SPEAKER_03]: How many things can you use that stupid vision cam for?

661
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:42,077
[SPEAKER_03]: One, to make your own icon on Xbox Live that only your friends can see.

662
00:43:42,457 --> 00:43:43,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Totem Ball!

663
00:43:43,438 --> 00:43:44,538
[SPEAKER_02]: That game was awesome!

664
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:49,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to count Totem Ball because that's something against the Xbox Live camera.

665
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:52,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's Strip Uno.

666
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:53,703
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

667
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:56,105
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the cam is good for.

668
00:43:56,479 --> 00:43:59,260
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have strip, you know, checkers, strip chests.

669
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I guess you also have hardwood hearts or whatever.

670
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,040
[SPEAKER_03]: But who plays those games?

671
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardwood hearts.

672
00:44:06,161 --> 00:44:10,182
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, did you play the spy glass games or whatever it was called?

673
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:11,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of crap.

674
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of sloppy.

675
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:13,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

676
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:14,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it at all.

677
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:19,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because, you know, a game supports the fucking camera, which, to be honest, I think all of the games should support the damn camera.

678
00:44:21,904 --> 00:44:22,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

679
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:22,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

680
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:44,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason brings up a point, Texas Hold'em supports it now, I forgot about that Oh yeah, that is true I haven't played Texas Hold'em in a long time Which is too bad because I think we were invited to a tournament And that reminds me, I need to reply to that email Because we're being stuck up by not replying, my bad Alright, but we really suck at Hold'em Is anybody good at Hold'em?

681
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:48,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I was okay Really, you should play for us then, I don't want to play I'm not that good

682
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:51,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay at it.

683
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We could all play.

684
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:55,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We could all go to the same place and play together.

685
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:56,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I have better things to play.

686
00:44:57,163 --> 00:45:01,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Hold'em once with Bobby for maybe 20 minutes and that was it.

687
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,986
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, very cool news for the PlayStation 3.

688
00:45:07,866 --> 00:45:08,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.

689
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:10,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool news for the PlayStation 3.

690
00:45:10,366 --> 00:45:11,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm completely serious here.

691
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:12,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

692
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:15,508
[SPEAKER_03]: DivX is going to be partnering with Sony.

693
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:17,488
[SPEAKER_03]: This is based on an announcement from DivX.

694
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:21,389
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be integrating its video playback technology into the PlayStation 3.

695
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:30,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you update your development kits to 2.0, you can already utilize the DivX technology for your games.

696
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:32,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully...

697
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:43,764
[SPEAKER_03]: If DivX gets enabled in a future PlayStation 3 firmware upgrade, which at this point, who's to say why wouldn't it, then you can actually watch all the porn that you download over the internet and all the pirated movies.

698
00:45:44,064 --> 00:45:47,006
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to watch that over your local network.

699
00:45:47,046 --> 00:45:49,488
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be totally useful for someone who pirates.

700
00:45:50,969 --> 00:45:53,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad that I will not be using that.

701
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, not that you should be pirating.

702
00:45:54,811 --> 00:45:56,212
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wrong.

703
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you should not be doing that.

704
00:46:00,956 --> 00:46:03,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if it's on the internet, it must be okay to download, right?

705
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:06,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they wouldn't put something illegal on the internet, would they?

706
00:46:06,586 --> 00:46:07,608
[SPEAKER_07]: No, of course not.

707
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,418
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just completely... Question from OL Army Ninja in chat.

708
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:18,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Did OLR really just go two whole stories about Sony and not bad talk them?

709
00:46:19,461 --> 00:46:24,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, we said a long time ago, when Sony does something right, we will give them credit for it.

710
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,824
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll make fun of them for everything else.

711
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:29,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm equally offensive against all consoles.

712
00:46:29,825 --> 00:46:37,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, this week's live edition, fucking Shrek enroll in Screwjumper.

713
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:38,229
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is that shit?

714
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:39,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Shrek enroll.

715
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,592
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, Shrek should never be on the fucking Xbox Live Arcade ever.

716
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:45,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Bucks

717
00:47:12,947 --> 00:47:13,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal.

718
00:47:13,147 --> 00:47:14,528
[SPEAKER_07]: That is no lie, unlike the cake.

719
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:14,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Portal.

720
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, are you saying just buy this game for Portal and the hell with everything else?

721
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:44,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Just buy it for Portal and the hell with everything else.

722
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:58,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I did find a very interesting thing on looking, because I was reading some of the forums about it, because people are trying to piece in where Portal is supposed to fit in the Half-Life story, which I thought was really cool speculation, because I love speculating about storylines and things.

723
00:47:58,495 --> 00:47:58,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

724
00:47:59,155 --> 00:48:00,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you telling me there's Portal fanfic?

725
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:01,376
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

726
00:48:01,856 --> 00:48:02,536
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually does fit.

727
00:48:02,556 --> 00:48:03,096
[SPEAKER_07]: There is.

728
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:06,137
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's weighted companion cube fan art.

729
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:06,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

730
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,736
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it's not weighted companion cube slash, then we're okay.

731
00:48:11,336 --> 00:48:25,904
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I was reading just how they were speculating how it fitted in, and someone was saying that there's a way that you can import the Half-Life 2 maps into Portal, and you can use the Portal gun in Half-Life 2.

732
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:27,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the other way around.

733
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:31,867
[SPEAKER_07]: It was saying specifically that they moved the maps to the Portal folder.

734
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It was using some program or something.

735
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the other way around.

736
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,371
[SPEAKER_02]: They imported the portal gun into Half-Life 2.

737
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:41,092
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you can do that.

738
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:44,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I was going to say there is... You can probably do both.

739
00:48:44,913 --> 00:48:52,596
[SPEAKER_02]: If you notice in the game, actually there's a few times where you can see through the window and there's a little slide projector.

740
00:48:52,656 --> 00:49:00,338
[SPEAKER_02]: They're showing Aperture Science versus I don't remember what the other corporation is in Half-Life 2, so forgive me there.

741
00:49:00,882 --> 00:49:03,404
[SPEAKER_02]: But a whole little thing about that.

742
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they're making competing technologies and stuff.

743
00:49:07,086 --> 00:49:08,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's even in the song, too.

744
00:49:08,747 --> 00:49:12,570
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking about that whole thing.

745
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are people in the chat saying Rule 34 and laughing?

746
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:17,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a Portal joke that I don't get?

747
00:49:17,353 --> 00:49:20,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

748
00:49:22,556 --> 00:49:23,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I still haven't played it.

749
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:26,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll download it on Steam this week.

750
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:27,159
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

751
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tear myself away from the MMOs long enough.

752
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Forgive me.

753
00:49:31,529 --> 00:49:34,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Assassin's Creed, it's quite interesting.

754
00:49:34,591 --> 00:49:40,413
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been reports coming out now that the PlayStation 3 version, let's see here.

755
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:41,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's your story.

756
00:49:41,914 --> 00:49:42,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

757
00:49:43,575 --> 00:49:44,995
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation Store updates, yes.

758
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:52,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of cool stuff for the PlayStation Store this week, including actually one that I was kind of looking at, although I played something very similar to it.

759
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:55,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was actually on the PlayStation Network.

760
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Toy Home, it's a little car racing game, kind of like Micro Machines or something like that.

761
00:50:00,882 --> 00:50:03,823
[SPEAKER_02]: High Velocity Bowling Time Crisis 4, Battlefield, Bad Company, Burnout Paradise Other than...

762
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Knight Teaser Trailer

763
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:50,346
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

764
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:20,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to watch out for this, though, or maybe you won't get to access that PlayStation Store.

765
00:51:20,055 --> 00:51:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the brand-newly-discovered white screen of death on the PlayStation 3.

766
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:26,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cause?

767
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:28,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Assassin's Creed.

768
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:36,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, some folks who are using firmware 2.0 are getting the white screen of death while playing Assassin's Creed.

769
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,736
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming up on posts on the Ubisoft forums.

770
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:48,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently, there's a lot of folks that are posting about these freezing issues and bug glitch issues.

771
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:49,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it.

772
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:50,663
[SPEAKER_03]: No real...

773
00:51:53,434 --> 00:51:53,855
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

774
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:09,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the game actually had a worse frame rate slightly than the Xbox 360 version.

775
00:52:09,605 --> 00:52:14,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also some videos online of some pretty weird glitches in the game, like one where you fall through the earth.

776
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:18,488
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one where your character kind of clones himself.

777
00:52:19,248 --> 00:52:21,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're controlling two copies of your character.

778
00:52:21,648 --> 00:52:26,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, someone on my friends list played both and actually said the PlayStation 3 is a little better.

779
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:32,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe if these issues don't come to haunt you, then you're...

780
00:52:33,644 --> 00:52:34,124
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fine.

781
00:52:34,764 --> 00:52:35,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

782
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:39,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say also that the game ain't that good.

783
00:52:41,006 --> 00:52:41,667
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing.

784
00:52:41,687 --> 00:52:42,507
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't like it, really?

785
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:43,027
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

786
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:44,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of good things about it.

787
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:45,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played a little bit of it.

788
00:52:45,348 --> 00:52:48,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I've played it, yeah, but a lot of people are really liking it.

789
00:52:49,029 --> 00:52:50,369
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was I going to say about that?

790
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:51,330
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it you don't like about it?

791
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,410
[SPEAKER_02]: It's boring.

792
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:53,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

793
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as... You can kill people.

794
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:56,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

795
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:57,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's like any game.

796
00:52:58,672 --> 00:52:59,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

797
00:53:00,673 --> 00:53:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't care for it.

798
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:04,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see what the fuss was about.

799
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,700
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

800
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:18,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there was a rumor circulating around that Capcom was thinking about putting a Resident Evil 5 demo on the Blu-ray for Resident Evil Extinction.

801
00:53:19,827 --> 00:53:23,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And also another one saying that Devil May Cry 4 would have a demo on there.

802
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:26,330
[SPEAKER_07]: But Capcom said, uh-uh, they're just putting trailers up.

803
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:29,011
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been so cool, though.

804
00:53:29,712 --> 00:53:29,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

805
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:31,793
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people very excited about Resident Evil 5.

806
00:53:32,691 --> 00:53:33,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Capcom should do it.

807
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still... The demo is a lie.

808
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,198
[SPEAKER_02]: They should put like a really crappy demo for something.

809
00:53:40,579 --> 00:53:44,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Just have like, you know, a stick figure with like a... They should put Doom on there.

810
00:53:44,502 --> 00:53:46,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet another bastardization of Mega Man.

811
00:53:47,846 --> 00:53:50,949
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they should do like Resident Evil with Doom graphics.

812
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,051
[SPEAKER_07]: With all pixel...

813
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:54,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this.

814
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:58,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 in chat says, God, I need that Resident Evil 5 demo.

815
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:01,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice how it's not like I want, I wish they would put it out there.

816
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:03,047
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, I need it.

817
00:54:04,467 --> 00:54:05,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I need it now.

818
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:10,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I need Animal Crossing Wii, but I'm just going to have to wait a little longer.

819
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:11,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Life sucks.

820
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:12,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait.

821
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Dennis Leary says, life sucks, wear a helmet.

822
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Life's going to suck when you grow up.

823
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:20,711
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I know.

824
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:27,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, well, there's a few games, though, that you're not going to have to wait much longer to play, and that's the stuff coming out this week.

825
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in the U.S., starting off here... Oh, dear God, Friday.

826
00:54:32,389 --> 00:54:34,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, oh my God, the release dates for Japan are huge.

827
00:54:34,811 --> 00:54:40,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, give sympathy to our... Everybody, get a book, get a pillow, we're going to have a long segment for release dates this week.

828
00:54:40,795 --> 00:54:44,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody, feel sorry for our retail workers this Friday.

829
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:47,639
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not going to be a long segment, actually, there's not a lot coming out this week.

830
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, the Japanese ones are huge.

831
00:54:50,376 --> 00:54:56,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I was just going to mention, I think this came out last week already, and I have kind of a last-minute story about it later on.

832
00:54:56,479 --> 00:55:02,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Avatar, the Burning Earth, now the new record holder for the fastest way to get achievements on Xbox 360.

833
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:03,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

834
00:55:03,442 --> 00:55:04,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's coming out now.

835
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:06,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby Pals on the DS.

836
00:55:06,934 --> 00:55:09,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's another fucking baby-raising sim.

837
00:55:10,176 --> 00:55:13,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, did you say baby-raising or baby-racing?

838
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:16,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, a baby-racing game?

839
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

840
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: A baby-racing game would be hardcore.

841
00:55:19,722 --> 00:55:21,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd buy that shit.

842
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:23,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Developers, are you listening?

843
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:24,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Baby-racing.

844
00:55:24,846 --> 00:55:25,646
[SPEAKER_00]: More babies!

845
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:27,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Babies versus kittens.

846
00:55:29,048 --> 00:55:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Who will win?

847
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Cabela's Monster Bass.

848
00:55:32,688 --> 00:55:34,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bass fishing game on the PlayStation 2.

849
00:55:35,689 --> 00:55:40,410
[SPEAKER_02]: College Hoops 2K8 is coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360 this week.

850
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,171
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI Dark Motives.

851
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:46,412
[SPEAKER_02]: CSI game on the DS.

852
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:47,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently a venture game.

853
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:48,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of crappy.

854
00:55:49,873 --> 00:55:51,753
[SPEAKER_02]: The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific.

855
00:55:52,254 --> 00:55:55,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Another piece of shovelware on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3.

856
00:55:56,075 --> 00:55:57,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you call that shovelware?

857
00:55:57,535 --> 00:55:57,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

858
00:55:57,895 --> 00:55:58,495
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?

859
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,056
[SPEAKER_02]: It means it's crap.

860
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:02,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, anyways.

861
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:06,298
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, it's on PlayStation 2 this week because the other games got delayed.

862
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:10,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Fashion Designer on the PC.

863
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you too can design crap.

864
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Party DS.

865
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a good game, so pick that one up.

866
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:20,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Medal of Honor Airborne for the PlayStation 3.

867
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:22,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess better late than never.

868
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:24,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Jam on the Wii.

869
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:25,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Same there.

870
00:56:26,872 --> 00:56:30,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see... Time Crisis 4, which is including the Gun Con.

871
00:56:31,496 --> 00:56:33,117
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 3.

872
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:35,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be worth picking up if you like gun games.

873
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Unreal Tournament 3, coming out on PC.

874
00:56:39,282 --> 00:56:40,343
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should be pretty awesome.

875
00:56:40,523 --> 00:56:42,304
[SPEAKER_02]: No word on the PlayStation 3 version yet.

876
00:56:43,706 --> 00:56:47,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see... World of Warcraft, March of the Legion.

877
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:49,270
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the card game.

878
00:56:50,331 --> 00:56:52,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone's interested in the World of Warcraft card game.

879
00:56:54,294 --> 00:56:55,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here...

880
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:04,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Soldier of Fortune Payback on the PlayStation 3 actually got delayed to this week, which I thought was kind of interesting.

881
00:57:06,037 --> 00:57:08,699
[SPEAKER_02]: AMF Bowling Pinbusters on the Wii.

882
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is a good game or not, but it's only $20.

883
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:18,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like bowling and you're a little tired of Wii Sports bowling, you might want to check that out.

884
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:40,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Then finally, Final Fantasy Online, they have the Vanadil Collection 2008 on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360, which is going to include, of course, all the previous expansions, the original game, and of course, the other thing that's coming out this week, the Final Fantasy XI Online Wings of the Goddess expansion, which should make some people happy.

885
00:57:41,184 --> 00:57:41,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

886
00:57:43,105 --> 00:57:43,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see then.

887
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:46,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and that's also coming on PC as well.

888
00:57:46,947 --> 00:57:47,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on...

889
00:57:49,722 --> 00:57:52,744
[SPEAKER_02]: on the DS, John Deere, Harvest in the Heartland.

890
00:57:53,664 --> 00:57:56,086
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a farming sim for real.

891
00:57:57,787 --> 00:57:59,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that, Harvest Moon.

892
00:58:00,308 --> 00:58:02,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Luxor Pharaoh's Challenge on PlayStation 2.

893
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:04,971
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll probably suck.

894
00:58:07,492 --> 00:58:09,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghost Squad on the Wii, which I highly recommend you pick up.

895
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:14,756
[SPEAKER_02]: That's only $29.99, so definitely a great gun game for the Wii.

896
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:17,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And also uses the Wii Zapper, which is also coming out this week.

897
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:21,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur Legends, which I heard sucked, has come out on the Wii.

898
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:30,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock Band, of course, probably the biggest game this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, both the special edition and the game only.

899
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Showtime Boxing on the Wii also sucked.

900
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:38,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Star Trek Conquest on PlayStation 2 also sucked.

901
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake, probably also sucks.

902
00:58:45,704 --> 00:58:48,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XII, Revenant Wings, that game sucked.

903
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:49,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good on the DS.

904
00:58:50,407 --> 00:58:52,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Godzilla Unleashed also sucked.

905
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:59,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that is it.

906
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said there's not a lot coming out this week.

907
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:04,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, that took like five minutes.

908
00:59:05,423 --> 00:59:06,224
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because I'm slow.

909
00:59:06,725 --> 00:59:06,985
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

910
00:59:07,383 --> 00:59:08,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Wings of the Goddess

911
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:31,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally makes its way to the Xbox 360 as well this week in Japan.

912
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:37,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out, Medal of Honor Airborne, also for the 360, and another 360 game.

913
00:59:37,693 --> 00:59:39,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And you didn't think there was anything for the 360 in Japan.

914
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:43,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning Eleven 2008 makes its way to Japan.

915
00:59:44,197 --> 00:59:48,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming to the Wii this week in Japan, Dragon Blade comes out.

916
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,442
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from D3, is publishing this.

917
00:59:53,443 --> 00:59:55,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, looks like another role-playing game.

918
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an action game like God of War.

919
00:59:57,496 --> 01:00:01,217
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a rip-off of God of War, but it's not even close to being as good as God of War.

920
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:05,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, because from the box art and everything, it looks like your typical RPG, but there you have it.

921
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:10,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario & Sonic at the Olympics makes its way to Japan, also on the Wii this week, the 22nd.

922
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on PlayStation 3, another version of Harry Potter, because of course those games come out on every console.

923
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:23,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Remi no Oishi Restaurant, which you know better on these shores as Ratatouille.

924
01:00:23,664 --> 01:00:25,284
[SPEAKER_03]: That movie, Ratatouille, whatever.

925
01:00:26,298 --> 01:00:27,919
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2 Princess Osagasi

926
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:55,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Quest IV

927
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:20,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Quest IV

928
01:01:46,724 --> 01:01:55,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Uno Ikusi, IQ Breeder is coming out, and it looks like something between a dog sim and a brain training game.

929
01:01:56,209 --> 01:01:56,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.

930
01:01:56,949 --> 01:02:01,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your two biggest DS games, cram them together, and you have this game.

931
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:02,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Lovely.

932
01:02:03,393 --> 01:02:05,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's where you beat the dog until it's smart.

933
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:07,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I somehow doubt that.

934
01:02:08,795 --> 01:02:08,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

935
01:02:09,236 --> 01:02:11,437
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there it is, your Japanese releases.

936
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:12,497
[SPEAKER_07]: P-p-p-puppies.

937
01:02:13,658 --> 01:02:15,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, there's a crap load of stuff coming out in the U.K.,

938
01:02:16,622 --> 01:02:20,024
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 22nd, we have Final Fantasy XI, Wings of the Goddess.

939
01:02:20,664 --> 01:02:21,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

940
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:26,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Smarty Pants on Wii.

941
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:29,628
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd, Ace Combat 6, Fires of Liberation, which actually is not all that great.

942
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:31,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I will tell you that from experience.

943
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:39,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Beowulf, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II, Code Lyoko, I guess.

944
01:02:40,773 --> 01:02:42,854
[SPEAKER_07]: CSI, Crime Scene Investigation, Hard Evidence.

945
01:02:43,833 --> 01:03:01,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Dewey's Adventure, Ferrari Challenge on Wii and DS, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock on a bunch of stuff, Jackass the Game, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, Kane and Lynch, Deadman, Lair, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, Mass Effect, Medal of Honor Heroes 2, My Horse and Me.

946
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:03,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that's a funny name.

947
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:06,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how can I forget Mass Effect?

948
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:09,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo Loki.

949
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:11,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo you, whatever.

950
01:03:13,816 --> 01:03:28,899
[SPEAKER_07]: NBA 2K8, Need for Speed Pro Street, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance, Siphon Filter, Logan Shadow, Time Crisis 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Warhammer 40K, Squad Command.

951
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:29,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate Warhammer.

952
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we got some stories in there you'll like later.

953
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:34,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it?

954
01:03:35,901 --> 01:03:36,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

955
01:03:36,361 --> 01:03:36,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

956
01:03:37,588 --> 01:03:40,549
[SPEAKER_03]: You just threw that mic down at the mere mention of Warhammer.

957
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:42,569
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuck is Warhammer shit?

958
01:03:42,669 --> 01:03:46,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I have bad memories of Warhammer.

959
01:03:47,411 --> 01:03:47,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Do share.

960
01:03:48,571 --> 01:03:51,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I dated a guy who was a Warhammer player and all he did was play Warhammer.

961
01:03:52,852 --> 01:03:58,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Replace Warhammer with World of Warcraft and you have a lot of relationships in this day and age.

962
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:01,215
[SPEAKER_07]: He would spend hours painting his stupid little models.

963
01:04:01,835 --> 01:04:06,296
[SPEAKER_07]: And where the stupid little models were kind of cool, I was like, dude, you are too obsessed with this shit.

964
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:10,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I got too bored with painting the models, so I just, you know.

965
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:13,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The models suck.

966
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like a few millimeters tall.

967
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:17,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, fuck, I can't paint this shit.

968
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,418
[SPEAKER_02]: My dog ended up eating a lot of them anyways.

969
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:22,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So, wow.

970
01:04:22,921 --> 01:04:23,702
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were cool.

971
01:04:24,222 --> 01:04:24,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for a while.

972
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:31,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, one thing that's also cool, although it's a little late for it about now, is a new Terminator game.

973
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:35,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Halcon is adapting Terminator for a brand new game.

974
01:04:36,053 --> 01:04:39,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's not based off the new Terminator series, which I'm sure is going to blow.

975
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:41,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure tons.

976
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:49,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say this Terminator thing comes just in time for the Sarah Connor Chronicles, which I'm sure tons of people will be watching this winter on Fox during the writer's strike.

977
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:53,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Sarah Connor Chronicles.

978
01:04:53,948 --> 01:04:55,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking emo shit, just like goddamn, um...

979
01:05:11,997 --> 01:05:30,884
[SPEAKER_02]: was it Smallville or something like that where they just there's Terminators coming after me it's like seriously they're just going to keep coming after you until you die so get used to it it also has the you better not make my character gay kid from Heroes in it who was then written out of the show remember that the management was like

980
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:31,952
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

981
01:05:55,782 --> 01:05:59,847
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

982
01:06:08,325 --> 01:06:11,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Terminator Salvation The Future Begins Lame!

983
01:06:11,766 --> 01:06:12,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to be coming out later.

984
01:06:13,326 --> 01:06:17,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this comment from Odd1 in our chat room, who's making a lot of win comments tonight.

985
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:18,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

986
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:21,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd1 says, Terminator without the Terminator.

987
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:21,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

988
01:06:22,109 --> 01:06:27,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Next up, Star Wars without lightsabers and Doctor Who based in South Central LA.

989
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:30,391
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

990
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctor Who-ed.

991
01:06:34,472 --> 01:06:35,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctor Who-ed.

992
01:06:36,522 --> 01:06:37,403
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not funny.

993
01:06:38,003 --> 01:06:38,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

994
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:39,204
[SPEAKER_03]: You're smiling.

995
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:43,287
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, did you know I have to play Doctor Who this weekend at the show?

996
01:06:43,427 --> 01:06:45,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go out and buy some Converse this weekend.

997
01:06:45,989 --> 01:06:47,110
[SPEAKER_03]: It kept going back and forth.

998
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to be Professor X, not Doctor Who.

999
01:06:49,192 --> 01:06:51,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Payless and get Airwalks.

1000
01:06:51,734 --> 01:06:52,415
[SPEAKER_07]: They're more comfortable.

1001
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1002
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:54,736
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

1003
01:06:58,199 --> 01:06:59,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think the Terminator...

1004
01:07:00,411 --> 01:07:13,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, it's like, I know why they announced that they're making a new Terminator game to kind of build off the hype of other announcements out there, but I mean, how can you get excited about a game that's going to come out for like two years about the Terminator?

1005
01:07:14,216 --> 01:07:19,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be back into it, which he's not because he's in the fucking political game now.

1006
01:07:20,698 --> 01:07:20,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1007
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't get all excited.

1008
01:07:22,781 --> 01:07:29,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, what good Terminator games have there been out there, excluding Terminator the arcade game, which was Terminator 2 the arcade game.

1009
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:31,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say Terminator 2 the arcade game.

1010
01:07:31,368 --> 01:07:34,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was okay as a gun game, but really it wasn't that great.

1011
01:07:36,874 --> 01:07:37,514
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1012
01:08:00,149 --> 01:08:05,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, you know, if you've listened to this game for any length of time, you know I have a lot of love for the very first Civilization game.

1013
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:08,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And the others that have come out since then have kind of turned me off.

1014
01:08:08,796 --> 01:08:10,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that, I never touched Civ IV.

1015
01:08:11,158 --> 01:08:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: But I need to go give it a try now, because I have been playing GameTap.

1016
01:08:14,541 --> 01:08:15,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely want to go check that out.

1017
01:08:16,563 --> 01:08:17,824
[SPEAKER_03]: The other ones are just too complicated.

1018
01:08:17,864 --> 01:08:19,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I like my Civ Simple, which Civ I was.

1019
01:08:20,606 --> 01:08:25,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyhow, for the record, when the service started, there were only 300 games available on it.

1020
01:08:25,831 --> 01:08:27,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are a thousand.

1021
01:08:27,785 --> 01:08:34,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So on GameTap.com is the information on all the games that are on the service, plus this interesting little picture.

1022
01:08:36,572 --> 01:08:39,335
[SPEAKER_03]: You know those big pictures that are made up of little pictures?

1023
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:40,556
[SPEAKER_03]: They have one of those.

1024
01:08:40,756 --> 01:08:41,717
[SPEAKER_02]: A mosaic?

1025
01:08:42,037 --> 01:08:42,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, a mosaic.

1026
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:43,799
[SPEAKER_03]: The word escaped me.

1027
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:49,583
[SPEAKER_03]: They have that, but you can do a mouseover on all the little box arts and see what games they are.

1028
01:08:50,644 --> 01:08:52,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, box arts!

1029
01:08:53,787 --> 01:08:55,148
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I said.

1030
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:56,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, box arts.

1031
01:08:57,355 --> 01:09:00,536
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week

1032
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:27,834
[SPEAKER_07]: The Guardian Legend The Guardian Legend

1033
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:54,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it starts off as a shooter, and then it's like an adventure RPG sort of thing.

1034
01:09:54,522 --> 01:09:58,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And you talk to these little guys called Blue Landers, who look a lot like Lolo.

1035
01:09:59,787 --> 01:10:06,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it's basically as you're going through it, you know, you have to pick up your power-ups, you actually, um...

1036
01:10:07,498 --> 01:10:12,941
[SPEAKER_07]: As your score goes up, you earn different other power-ups and more chips.

1037
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:15,323
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how your power-ups are stored.

1038
01:10:15,663 --> 01:10:20,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you earn more life, too, as you go through the game until you're the super-powered badass.

1039
01:10:22,727 --> 01:10:24,548
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a couple of neat glitches in the game.

1040
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:31,652
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them where if you had a barrier up the middle, if you held diagonally, you could actually walk through the barrier.

1041
01:10:32,577 --> 01:10:32,817
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

1042
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:07,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you didn't use this one video file that I linked you to because that person could not play the first level for shit.

1043
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:09,131
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1044
01:11:09,672 --> 01:11:12,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my own searching around YouTube to find this clip.

1045
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:13,113
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little better.

1046
01:11:13,594 --> 01:11:16,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's some overworld music, and then I'm going to switch to Jamie's favorite song in the game.

1047
01:11:17,556 --> 01:11:17,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1048
01:11:18,836 --> 01:11:19,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Play a little bit of it.

1049
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:29,362
[SPEAKER_07]: The one cool thing about this is, for anyone who doesn't know too much about it, the original game was actually on the MSX called Gartic.

1050
01:11:30,544 --> 01:11:34,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is actually the sequel to that, Guarded Gaiden, which was what it was called in Japan.

1051
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:43,830
[SPEAKER_07]: It was also put out by Compile that gave us a bunch of really, really cool games.

1052
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:51,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, another one of my favorite shooters was Robo Aleste, which is, you know, they just did a whole crap ton of shooters.

1053
01:11:54,235 --> 01:11:56,716
[SPEAKER_03]: This is somebody shooting the gun repeatedly to open the corridor.

1054
01:11:56,836 --> 01:11:58,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Because every corridor had its own little trick to open it.

1055
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:01,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me actually switch.

1056
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to switch to the music that Jamie says is her favorite in the game, which is the music to Corridor No.

1057
01:12:05,933 --> 01:12:05,913
6.

1058
01:12:05,953 --> 01:12:08,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the overworld music after that.

1059
01:12:08,855 --> 01:12:09,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the overworld music.

1060
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:10,296
[SPEAKER_07]: The overworld music.

1061
01:12:10,316 --> 01:12:10,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1062
01:12:10,556 --> 01:12:13,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this music's good, too.

1063
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:16,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this one, too, but the overworld music was my favorite.

1064
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:16,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

1065
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll skip ahead a little bit in the video.

1066
01:12:18,842 --> 01:12:19,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that one.

1067
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:21,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, damn it.

1068
01:12:21,464 --> 01:12:22,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It was right before that.

1069
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:22,865
[SPEAKER_03]: It was right before this?

1070
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's right after here.

1071
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:29,896
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the destruction of Corridor 15.

1072
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:54,491
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love this game.

1073
01:12:54,531 --> 01:12:55,632
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no easy way to say it.

1074
01:12:55,712 --> 01:12:57,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is about this game.

1075
01:12:57,093 --> 01:13:02,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the fact that it's like a little bit of everything, which for the ADD gamer like me is wonderful.

1076
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I don't know like...

1077
01:13:06,101 --> 01:13:09,142
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have to do to get a sequel to this game that doesn't suck.

1078
01:13:09,242 --> 01:13:20,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I realize there might be licensing issues and who owns the works and such and such, but my god, I beg you, if you're out there and you have the power to make a sequel to this game happen that doesn't suck, please do.

1079
01:13:20,424 --> 01:13:22,824
[SPEAKER_04]: What would technically be the third in the trilogy, then?

1080
01:13:22,904 --> 01:13:27,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's true, because you do count Guardic, but Guardic, it's not nearly as memorable as this game.

1081
01:13:27,765 --> 01:13:29,965
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've seen Guardic, it's not that exciting.

1082
01:13:30,626 --> 01:13:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: This really took it to a whole new level.

1083
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:32,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um...

1084
01:13:34,033 --> 01:13:40,636
[SPEAKER_07]: There is actually another glitch in the game, and I had actually remembered this because I had a glitched copy, my very first one was.

1085
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:46,419
[SPEAKER_07]: If you got your score to 10 million points, the game would crash and you couldn't play anymore.

1086
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So the later releases would only let you go up to a maximum score of 9,999,990, because the points were all multiples of 10.

1087
01:13:57,194 --> 01:14:04,898
[SPEAKER_07]: and for anyone who's a big fan of the Compile games, the Blue Lander is actually one of their mascots and was also in the Sega Master System game called Govelius.

1088
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:07,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1089
01:14:07,139 --> 01:14:07,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1090
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was not made by Square, chat room.

1091
01:14:10,521 --> 01:14:14,002
[SPEAKER_03]: This is made by Compile, published by Broderbund here in the U.S.

1092
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:14,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1093
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:15,303
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

1094
01:14:15,963 --> 01:14:21,026
[SPEAKER_03]: And because none of those companies exist anymore, that's why it's sadly unlikely we're going to see this, but...

1095
01:14:21,869 --> 01:14:31,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly this game could make its way to Virtual Console only based on the fact that Lode Runner was also a Broderbund game and that did come out on Virtual Console for TurboGrafx.

1096
01:14:31,531 --> 01:14:32,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So you never know.

1097
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:33,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing is impossible, I suppose.

1098
01:14:34,651 --> 01:14:39,172
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is one of my... Not only does Jamie love this game, I do too.

1099
01:14:39,192 --> 01:14:42,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how Loki feels about it, but he better like it or he's fired.

1100
01:14:42,813 --> 01:14:43,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1101
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:47,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic game of the week, Guardian Legend.

1102
01:14:48,374 --> 01:14:48,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done.

1103
01:14:49,520 --> 01:15:00,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well with that we are going to wrap up part A of tonight's show and we'll be back in a little bit with part B of Orange Lounge Radio just in time for Thanksgiving for those folks listening on the podcast.

1104
01:15:01,303 --> 01:15:06,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1105
