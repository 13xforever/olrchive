00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,240
Today, November 18th, 2007, Xbox 360 is getting its own virtual console of sorts, Divx is

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:31,920
coming to PlayStation 3, and is Nintendo DS redesign on its way next year?

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,240
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
Radio.

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,120
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,640
and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,520
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, the co-hosts that make this shiz happen, say

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,600
hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,760
And Rob gave me chocolate that has booze in it.

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,800
I hate to say it, but they didn't card me for it, so the alcohol is presumably cooked

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
out of the Malibu chocolate.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm pretty sure of it, but I still think that it's very, very tasty.

13
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,760
I've had some that has lots of alcohol in it though.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
That's cool.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
I want that.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
No bears.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,960
The ones that had the Grand Marnier in it, and they also had Johnny Walker.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,360
I have not heard of this.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
This sounds yummy.

20
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,800
I'll have to find out where Julie got them from, but they do card you for those.

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
I think you should do that now.

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
No.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Maybe you can get them at BevMo.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,240
I bet you could.

25
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
All right.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,080
Say hello as well to the one and only Loki.

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Hello.

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,080
How are you doing, Loki?

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,880
I'm okay other than a headache.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,520
Oh, I'm sorry to hear you have a headache.

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Do you need some Tylenol?

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
No, I already took some.

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Ibuprofen?

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Hammer?

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,520
I already took stuff.

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,040
By the way, for the lovely folks watching our webcam feed on Operator 11, you can see

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Loki's shirt.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Didn't you get this at Fonamy when we were in your life?

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Yeah, I got this at Fonamy.

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
Grand Theft Amish, Penn State Dutch.

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Lovely.

42
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,400
Very nice shirt there.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Nerd.

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,600
All right.

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Let's get into the show tonight.

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,880
We'll start it off as we always do.

47
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,440
You notice this is episode 256, though, I must say.

48
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,800
That is kind of a landmark number.

49
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
You know why?

50
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Well, not only is like two to a certain power, 256, but also that's one color for every color

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,280
in a VGA monitor.

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Impressive, no?

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,280
You're a geek.

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,880
How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

55
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,760
I played shit.

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Did you now?

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,160
But I'm trying to remember what exactly I played.

58
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
I played the After Burner.

60
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
What was it?

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
The After Burner arcade game.

62
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Yeah.

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
No, it was the new one.

64
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,200
The name's on my stupid iPhone.

65
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,320
Jamie and I went on a double date this week.

66
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Sort of.

67
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,680
Yeah, Dan came, too, and we played a bunch of ticket games at that John's Not Very Amazing

68
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
Pizza or Incredible.

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,600
It's John's Incredible Pizza, but we now call it John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza is what

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
it's called.

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I love it, but it's the new After Burner that came out, what, a year ago?

72
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
It looked pretty rad.

73
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I didn't even know it was there.

74
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,120
It's really, really cool, and we played a bunch of that, and I went on this Twister

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
thing.

76
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
The ride.

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
Oh, my God.

78
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
William was so funny.

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,680
A big hello to the person that worked there, Chris, who stopped us and was like, you're

80
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,240
the guy from Horizontal Radio, huh?

81
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
That was kind of cool.

82
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,640
I was like, I need to write this thing first.

83
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Ego++.

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
What?

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Level up.

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,640
He was recognized from the show by some guy who worked there.

87
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,920
It was pretty awesome.

88
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,840
So he recognized me because Dark Soccer was on the ride, and then I was like, oh, you

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
got to go meet Janie's mom.

90
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,160
Well, she's never on camera anyways, so I mean...

91
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
That's true.

92
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,000
You're not on Op 11, so they don't know what you look like, but she's in the album art,

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,080
so I'm sure if they've done their homework, they know, and she's on the All Games page.

94
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
There's a picture and all that stuff.

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,720
And I've got pictures of me on my Myspace.

96
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
Yeah, that's right.

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,140
Because I take them with my own camera.

98
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
That was awesome.

99
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
Of myself.

100
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,280
Sadly, I was not able to get free things from the ticket counter because William wanted

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,480
one of those... It was something really fruity, like a princess backpack or something stupid

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240
just to make me buy it for him.

103
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,880
I don't think it was so much that he probably wanted it, but he wanted me to buy it for

104
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
him with hardware tickets.

105
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,960
I wanted the Rock'em Sock'em robots.

106
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Those are cool.

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,920
I wanted the little mini pinball game because I'm not cool like Janie, and I have 20 pinball

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
machines in my house.

109
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Oh, yeah.

110
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
We traded out one of our pinballs.

111
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,000
We're actually holding some pinball machines for a friend, and so we got rid of Time Machine,

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,880
which made me sad, but we have a Black Knight now, not Black Knight 2000, but the old Black

113
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Knight, which is still a cool table.

114
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Oh, sorry.

115
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Go ahead.

116
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Go ahead.

117
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,480
I was going to say, I'd like to mention, I'm posting a link in the chat room right now,

118
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,600
which apparently I noticed my t-shirt had a web URL on it, so this is where you can

119
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
find it.

120
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
I had to go through a few links, but this guy has some other wonderful shirts, including

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,100
one that's a spoof of the Clerks shirt, or I guess box art from the movie, Clerks.

122
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,840
It says, just because they heal you doesn't mean they like you.

123
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,440
I think that's the same place I got my shirt that's the parody of the movie 300 that has

124
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
that one guy's face on it.

125
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
It says, this is Zelda.

126
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:52,120
It might be from some other guy, but he also has another one from, it says, gaming is as

127
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,160
addictive as sex, but there's no orgasm to let you know when to stop.

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,720
Wow, that's classy.

129
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Okay.

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,920
Back to Jamie's Gaming Week, please.

131
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,200
Loki, Rude.

132
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,520
So I played a lot more Ragnarok, of course, and I had a really nice game of World Cup

133
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:16,200
Soccer 94, which was a very, very good game, and I actually watched the entire play through

134
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,160
of Portal just because I watched it twice.

135
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,800
Did the cake ever come true?

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
No.

137
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,080
Sorry to hear it.

138
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,800
But I also, after the show, when I got home last week, because I had a three day weekend,

139
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,560
because I work for a bank.

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
Whatever.

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,480
I was really bored and had bad insomnia, so I completely redid my live journal, and I

142
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:48,080
now have a Portal theme with a big old lady companion cube on it.

143
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,760
I did watch the YouTube of the poor companion.

144
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,120
It was like a companion cube tribute on YouTube.

145
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah, that was...

146
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
People have the dumbest shit on YouTube.

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
You were laughing though.

148
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
I was.

149
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
It was funny.

150
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
That one part, though, where they played the...

151
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
You must now incinerate the cube or whatever.

152
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Oh, yeah, didn't they?

153
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Oh, yeah.

154
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,320
They played the one Imogen Heap song that they always play for every death scene ever

155
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,520
that I've ever seen.

156
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
That was great.

157
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,120
Yeah, so the video is like...

158
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,600
It's doing its thing, and it's showing...

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,380
It's like a tribute, and I was expecting Journey to come in or something, but then they have

160
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,820
to throw the cube in the incinerator, because that's what you do in one of the missions,

161
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,680
and then suddenly the definitive death song comes in.

162
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:34,480
No, it's not the companion cube.

163
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,320
And then they kept repeating it and speeding it up.

164
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
That was the best ever.

165
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,840
It's just like that.

166
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,880
Forget it, I tried.

167
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
iTunes just isn't friendly to do that.

168
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,920
It's just like that one SNL digital short that they have.

169
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
It is.

170
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,280
It's a total parody of that one short.

171
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,020
It was just the best thing ever.

172
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
But I was just...

173
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,840
Dear sister, thank you Tiger Claw in the chat room, chat.orangelester.com.

174
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
But I have...

175
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,260
And I'll try to find the walkthrough I was watching, but I was watching part seven of

176
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,560
the walkthrough, because that's my favorite one, because that's the one where the computer

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,640
goes starts going nuts and says, you must lay down in the party retrieval position.

178
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Wow.

179
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
All right.

180
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,000
We got to move on.

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,240
We don't want to have a portal show tonight.

182
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
That was great.

183
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
All right.

184
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Loki, how was your gaming week?

185
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
My gaming week was okay.

186
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,360
We played Earth Defense Force 2017 again.

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,600
We went back to that and actually did pretty well on the Inferno levels.

188
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,160
Hopefully going to try to finish that game eventually.

189
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,720
I tried a little bit of Mass Effect and there's a whole lot of talking in that game.

190
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,740
They really like to just use that.

191
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,480
They're like, man, we made a really cool conversation system.

192
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Let's constantly use it.

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,040
It's like, my God, shut the hell up.

194
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,200
I want to go on a mission already.

195
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,320
You have the best game reviews, Loki.

196
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Yeah.

197
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,080
So I play Mass Effect and it's a lot of talking.

198
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
It seriously is.

199
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,840
It's just like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

200
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh my God.

201
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,680
You're here for some reason that's not good or something and there's something going on.

202
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I wonder what it is.

203
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,800
To this point I'm like, I don't know who you are, nor do I care what's going on.

204
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,600
I just want to go fight something.

205
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,880
When I did go fight something, there were these stupid little flying things that shot

206
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,960
lasers at me.

207
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,760
My guys basically, I had one of my away team members, it must have been Sergeant I'm going

208
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,280
to die or something because fucker just ran up, started shooting at it and just stood

209
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,480
out in the middle of the open instead of taking cover like a smart person and died instantly.

210
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,640
Naturally there's feedback from the chat room here.

211
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,720
Odd One says, Dear God, an RPG where I have to talk to people?

212
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
What the hell?

213
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,920
No, but they go on and on and on and on and on.

214
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,100
I actually was skimming through it.

215
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,440
If I wanted to talk to everybody, I could do that as well and it's just, huh.

216
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,760
SSJ100Matt in chat.orangelshooter.com says, They spent a lot on voice actors, Loki.

217
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
They got to use them.

218
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Oh yeah, true.

219
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
But no, they got me wrong.

220
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,120
Dr. Uno invokes Elvis and says, A little more conversation, or no, a little less conversation,

221
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,600
a little more action please.

222
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Get it?

223
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Get it?

224
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,760
I mean, but to be fair, I played this game during a lunch, only half of a lunch, so about

225
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,960
30 minutes.

226
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,000
But dude, it took me 25 minutes to actually see some action in this game.

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's pretty bad.

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,840
But hey, it's going to be pretty cool, so I'm looking forward to playing a little more

229
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,360
of the game when I stop playing other games, which one of those other games, of course,

230
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,080
would be Rock Band.

231
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,720
I don't want to sound like a fanboy for Rock Band because I bought Guitar Hero 2 a long

232
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,000
time ago and didn't play that much of it.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,800
Rock Band, though, has actually got me excited about music games again.

234
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,000
It's worth playing.

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I like it.

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think it's pretty fun.

237
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
That's a big fucking statement there.

238
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,880
I mean, I'm actually working my way through the game on starting on easy and kind of building

239
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,560
up from there, but it's pretty awesome.

240
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,760
The equipment that comes with it, the controllers and stuff, they look quality.

241
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,200
Let me put it this way.

242
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,280
I know they still are kind of like toys, but they look a lot less like toys than, say,

243
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:40,760
the Guitar Hero controllers, which look like fucking KB toy shit, because you put them

244
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,920
side by side and you're like, oh my god.

245
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,720
I was actually playing on that one time.

246
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,000
The drums are good, although I cannot play drums in the house anymore because my wife

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
has told me not to because it's too loud.

248
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,160
They are very loud, those drums.

249
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
It's fun.

250
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,400
I really like the drums in the game.

251
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,000
I have not touched the vocal part of the game yet, but the microphone that comes with it

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
is really nice.

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,080
I hear, though, you can use any USB microphone and it will work just fine.

254
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,760
Also, I hear the rumor about the Guitar Hero 3 controllers not working in the game is false.

255
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,640
They do work in the game.

256
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,960
I was going to say, that's what they were using for the demo unit at the Best Buy near

257
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,200
my house.

258
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,440
I had known I had seen them before somewhere.

259
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,920
But I like the guitars that came with the Rock Band game.

260
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Those are nice guitars.

261
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
They are nice.

262
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
They are really nice.

263
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,560
The drums are pretty cool.

264
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,280
They get put together pretty fast.

265
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm still having trouble coordinating both the drums and the kick drum, but I have that

266
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,920
problem with drum mania as well.

267
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,160
But compared to the drum mania home game, this thing, once again, looks less like a

268
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
toy.

269
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,280
Can I bring the box in here for the OP11 people?

270
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Nothing is huge.

271
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,960
I want to show the people how epic it is.

272
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,080
Keep talking about your game week.

273
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,080
By the way, for those folks on OP11, after tonight's program, we're going to be back

274
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
going live.

275
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,000
We'll actually show you Rock Band and everything that's in it and play the game a little bit.

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,280
Loki is sworn up and down though.

277
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
He won't sing though.

278
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,240
We'll try our best.

279
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,400
One of the other things that's neat about the game is you can actually create your own

280
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
character in it.

281
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,040
I know that sounds stupid, but you actually want to play the game more so you unlock more

282
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,320
money so that you can buy more things for your character.

283
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,080
It's funny because I actually created a guy that's my guitarist because apparently you

284
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,800
can't use the same character for everything.

285
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,960
That box is fucking huge, I must say.

286
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,280
When I saw that, I'm like, holy crap, that thing is huge.

287
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,240
It's a good 20 pounds when it's full of all the equipment.

288
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,440
It's a big, big box, and it's not even full right now.

289
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
That makes sense though.

290
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Yeah, I know.

291
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,400
The other bad thing about it, and I had to cut a hole in the side of that box because

292
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,280
right now I'm using up the carry stuff back and forth, is once you put the guitar together

293
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,280
because the little top part snaps on, it doesn't fit in the box anymore, so I had to cut a

294
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,760
hole in the box for the guitar.

295
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,040
You can create your own characters, I actually created an emo goth guy called Azrael for

296
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,320
my guitarist because that's what I was trying to do, but you couldn't fit Azrael the best

297
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,480
Prince of Sorrow in there, so I just had to stick with Azrael.

298
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,360
It's pretty cool though, he looks kind of neat now.

299
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:35,480
My main character, Loki, who's playing drums, has the Dr. Who jacket, which is kind of neat.

300
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,640
There's a lot of things though, like one of the guitars in the game is actually a chainsaw,

301
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,920
which is kind of neat, and then you can create probably a lot of characters that look like

302
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,260
Sephiroth or Vincent and stuff, because there's a lot of outfits that look like you could

303
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,120
make characters that look like other things.

304
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,680
I loved the way that the custom characters interface themselves so well into the flow

305
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,800
of the game.

306
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,040
They look like they're in pre-rendered movies.

307
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,140
In the game, their mouths are synced up with the lyrics and everything, their plane is

308
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,520
synced up with the song, so they're not just fake strumming of the guitar and stuff, it's

309
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,400
actually synced up with the song, and the drummer actually drums to the song, so it's

310
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,160
pretty realistic.

311
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,520
I like the film grainy design.

312
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,120
I think that's how they get away with it, because I think by using that grainy film

313
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,360
thing, they're not doing it as high of a resolution as you think.

314
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,520
I think that's their way of getting around it, but it works.

315
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,460
Hats off to them for finding a cheap trick that works.

316
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,420
But it is funny, they're watching this really emo-looking guy singing Timmy and the Lords

317
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,280
of the Underworld.

318
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,820
Freeze pop song, A++.

319
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
It's a pretty cool game.

320
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,120
They unlock the tracks pretty easy too, they have a bonus little venue that you play that

321
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,320
unlocks all the unlockable tracks, but in order to be able to play the songs in practice

322
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,240
mode or whatever, you have to play them through the game.

323
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,840
I don't know, it's pretty nice, but I really recommend picking it up if you can find it,

324
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,160
I just know they're going to be really hard to find.

325
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,180
But if you can't find the game with all the instruments, and you don't really care about

326
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,920
drums too much, you can always pick up a USB microphone and just use your normal Guitar

327
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,080
Hero guitar with the game only, and save yourself some money that way.

328
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
I'll tell you right now where to get Rock Band.

329
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:30,080
If you go there the morning of the 20th, Tuesday when it comes out, Kmart, no one shops Kmart.

330
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,200
They might not be getting that many though, see that's the thing, everyone's allocations

331
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,000
are cut, so go to Best Buy or something like that if you can.

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,680
Anything else for your gaming week?

333
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,840
My gaming week, not too incredibly exciting because I've been going back and forth between

334
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,600
Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, I've been playing both.

335
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,680
I got my Corsair up to level 19 in Final Fantasy XI, and World of Warcraft, the 2.3 patch came

336
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
out, so I've just been trying to get used to all the changes with that, but I've got

337
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,560
to say they did a lot of really good subtle things that are great.

338
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,400
For instance, you know how there were fetch quests?

339
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,600
Go around and collect the weeds, or go around and find the empty boxes.

340
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,720
Sometimes you would have to wave your mouse around the screen until it turns that little

341
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,920
gear icon so you could find where the things are.

342
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,200
Now those items sparkle when you're on the quest, so it makes it a lot easier to see,

343
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
which is cool.

344
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
Little subtle things like that are neat.

345
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,320
When you're looking at the map and you get attacked, the screen flashes red, so you know

346
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,560
you're being beat up.

347
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,680
It's cool, good times.

348
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,920
The patch was very cool, and Final Fantasy XI, I'm just looking forward to the Wings

349
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,760
of the Goddess expansion because Dancer sounds awesome.

350
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,440
I never thought I'd say that, but Dancer, it's a battle healer.

351
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
How cool is that?

352
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,520
Dancers are battle healers.

353
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,960
Scholars seems kind of interesting too.

354
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,080
That's sort of how dancers are in Ragnarok.

355
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,040
Yes, and I think in the, well no, because in Tactics they were just female bards.

356
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
They were more buffers.

357
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,840
Oh yeah, they do more buffing, but they have like range healing and stuff like that.

358
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,080
That's exactly how they made them in Final Fantasy XI, is that they're kind of like buffers,

359
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,720
but with that range healing, but yet they can provoke the monster and they're like tanks.

360
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
It's crazy.

361
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
That's interesting.

362
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Do they dance, fight?

363
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,600
They just shake their ass.

364
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,960
You can be a Galka dancer.

365
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,840
There's videos on YouTube of the Galka dances.

366
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,280
It's awesome.

367
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,560
You use your TP to do attacks, but the thing is, it's like the first job I can think of

368
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,400
where you don't have to have 100% TP to do the special attacks, there's scenes you can

369
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,680
do with like 30 TP or 60, and TP is the stuff you build up as you attack.

370
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,000
It's toilet paper.

371
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,720
Not that kind of TP, not for your bunk hole.

372
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,160
You throw your toilet paper at them.

373
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,360
But then they do little jigs.

374
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
It's cute.

375
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,480
I also forgot, if you don't mind.

376
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
I'm sure.

377
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
I did make the guild for Ragnarok.

378
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,240
I would like to congratulate Ranma as being our first member.

379
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,200
Congrats.

380
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,880
And the guild is just Orange Lounge Radio.

381
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Very cool.

382
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
So look for the icon.

383
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Check that out.

384
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
All right.

385
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
I'll have to show you the YouTube edge of the Galka dances later.

386
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
I have to see that.

387
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,720
Op 11 is slowing down our stream a little bit because we're doing too much bandwidth.

388
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,000
I can't handle it.

389
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What else did I play?

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,480
Really quickly, I played that new word searching game on Xbox 360, just the demo.

391
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,680
I was a little disappointed that it's just basically an over-glorified word search game.

392
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Just kind of seems like a casual game.

393
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,000
Something that Mom might like, I don't know.

394
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,160
Mutant Storm Empire, though, much improved over the first Mutant Storm.

395
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,960
I think I need to go back and buy that one.

396
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,920
I think the greatest change they made to it is that they made levels feel more like levels

397
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,680
where it's almost like Smash TV kind of where you're walking through from room to room,

398
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,280
and it doesn't have that really slow loading time transition between the different rooms.

399
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,720
Did you download the free Carcassone?

400
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Carcassone?

401
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Carcassone.

402
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,840
Carcassone is something you cook for dinner, I think.

403
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Carcassone.

404
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Carcassone.

405
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Carcassone, I already had it.

406
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I got ripped off.

407
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,400
I bought Carcassone like two months ago, not when it was first out, but about a month after

408
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,440
it was first out I bought Carcassone, so I was kind of pissed when I heard that it was

409
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
out for free.

410
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
But what can you do?

411
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,720
That kind of stuff happens.

412
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,520
That's pretty much it.

413
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,160
Pika Uno played Screwjumper and said it sucks balls.

414
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,360
Oh yeah, this week's releases kind of suck balls.

415
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,960
All I heard is that Pika Uno beat my Boom Boom Rocket score, so I know what game I got

416
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
to play this week.

417
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,480
And maybe, maybe I will use the guitar.

418
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,560
You know what we have to do, Rob, what we didn't do last week?

419
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Metroid!

420
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
We haven't done the play for the past three months.

421
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,640
And I'm leaving on Thursday, so we'll have to do it like early this week.

422
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Soon.

423
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,240
I don't work Thursday and Friday, thankfully, but you're like, oh, I'm going to leave.

424
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm leaving midnight, like when it turns midnight.

425
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,200
So we'll have to do it on Tuesday.

426
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,840
Well, let's get into some housekeeping, speaking of Jamie leaving.

427
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,760
Jamie will be on vacation for the next two weeks from the show, so she's not going to

428
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,440
be here next week or the week after.

429
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Cry.

430
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
How dare she.

431
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
But Rob!

432
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
What?

433
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Fried chicken.

434
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,160
Maybe she'll bless us with her presence via the telephone.

435
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Who knows?

436
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Maybe.

437
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
We'll see.

438
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,460
You know, monkeys might, never mind.

439
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,980
I don't know if we'll have somebody else here or if it'll just be the Loki and Rob show.

440
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm going to try to reach out to Rice Princess so we can have a female perspective of Jamie's

441
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
absence.

442
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
I'll have you know.

443
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
But I don't know if she can make it.

444
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I'll have you know, Rob.

445
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
The Wee Zapper comes out next week.

446
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Oh!

447
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Oh, I have one.

448
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,160
Oh, how'd you do that already?

449
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,400
Freebies from the Game Crazy Manager thing.

450
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,680
How does that work?

451
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,240
What do we have that uses it?

452
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,260
But we have one!

453
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,260
We have a Wee Zapper.

454
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
All right.

455
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,960
But there's Link's crossbow training.

456
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,320
Oh yeah, I didn't care about that.

457
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,240
So yeah, the great Loki and Rob challenge with the Wee Zapper might go down in Jamie's

458
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
absence.

459
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,520
You should have Nellie come on the show.

460
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Yeah, she doesn't want to.

461
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Perhaps.

462
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
She's got to watch The Desperate Housewives.

463
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
A little briber.

464
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,360
What few episodes are left while the writer's guild's striking?

465
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,920
I told Dan to come on the show with me after I get back.

466
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
You should.

467
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Have him do that.

468
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Dan on the show is...

469
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Comedy.

470
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Yeah, it's hilarity.

471
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,640
Dan at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza was pretty funny.

472
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,440
I think, didn't he coin the phrase John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza?

473
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
No, that was me.

474
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
That was you.

475
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
He had another term for it.

476
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
I don't remember what it was.

477
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Incredibly Sucky Pizza.

478
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Yeah, John's Incredible World of Suck or something.

479
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
Yeah.

480
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,040
All right, anyway.

481
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,000
Our poor friend who works there.

482
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,760
Also housekeeping, muy importante, big news, huge, did you hear?

483
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,300
It's like all over a lot of podcast sites that you probably listen to.

484
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,760
There is now an official Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic on Xbox Live Marketplace.

485
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,480
It was part of the Xbox Live 5 celebration because Xbox has turned five years old last

486
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:02,040
week and a shitload of free gamer pics went up, 15 of them all from the AllGames.com family.

487
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,160
We are one of those.

488
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,800
Big thanks to Afro Guy who kind of like, he made the icons for us initially, but unfortunately

489
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,980
when they resized they didn't look right.

490
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,200
So Loki kind of took them, took the idea and redid it and did it in this pixel art thing.

491
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,640
So it kind of gives it a cool little retro look to it.

492
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,320
So it's an OLR gamer pic.

493
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,920
Actually that's now our Guild emblem too.

494
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,680
And it's actually the emblem for the Guitar Hero 3 band too.

495
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
So check that out.

496
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,120
Good job, Loki, and good job Afro Guy for making the...

497
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,640
Although resizing it to 24 by 24 was a pain in the ass.

498
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
It was, yeah, resizing the picture was horrendous.

499
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
That's not the size, but...

500
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,120
Well, I mean, but that's the size I had to use for Ragnarok.

501
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Oh, for Ragnarok.

502
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,600
Oh, I thought you meant the gamer pic.

503
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
No.

504
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
I was like, oh, oh.

505
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
All right.

506
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
So check that out.

507
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,040
Please go to the marketplace and look for Community Gamer Picks 2 and check that out.

508
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,660
Might I also add there is lots of other great podcasts in Community Gamer Picks 1 and hopefully

509
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,520
someday there'll be a Community Gamer Picks 3, but more you guys have to download them

510
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,160
and use them and then they go, oh, people like this stuff, so we should get more blogs

511
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,680
and more indie shows and that stuff in there, so very cool.

512
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,360
Also after tonight's show, I think I already mentioned this, on Operator 11, a special

513
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,900
live preview for Rock Band, and last week we did one for Mario Galaxy and the folks

514
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,020
in chat really seemed to like that and it was very well received.

515
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,740
So I'm hoping we can do more of these in the future in these live preview shows on Sundays

516
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,520
and other Op 11 specials.

517
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,100
All right.

518
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,840
That's all I can think of for housekeeping.

519
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,080
If no one else has anything, then we go to...

520
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,520
Actually, yeah, because I did get asked a question, just to let you know, my character

521
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,520
in Ragnarok that I've got the guild on, her name is Cecily, C-S-S-I-L-Y, if you look

522
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,880
for that character, if I'm on it, then you'll find me.

523
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,200
So if you want to be added to the guild, I got asked.

524
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,440
Also other questions from chat, Mac Man says, Sky, drunk show?

525
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,680
No, because I have to work the Monday after the four-day weekend, so not likely, but you

526
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,840
never know, stay tuned to the station, you never know when we'll go live randomly.

527
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,320
And let's see, what else do we have?

528
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,320
I thought there was another one I wanted to see.

529
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,680
Oh, Gerardo Mo says, can Loki sing in the preview?

530
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,680
I don't know.

531
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,440
I don't know, you're going to have to bribe him.

532
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,680
I don't know, Loki, what do you think?

533
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,320
Could you at least read us some news in a tingle outfit?

534
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
No.

535
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
All right, could you at least read us some news?

536
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Yeah.

537
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:36,000
Anyways, so there was a big announcement about the fall update, or winter update, I guess,

538
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
now.

539
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,680
Actually, it kind of leaked out first that the Xbox originals are going to be made available

540
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
to download.

541
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,720
What those are basically going to be is just a selection of original Xbox games that you

542
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,240
can download straight to your hard drive and play.

543
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,360
So this is actually going to be happening, it has been confirmed, and let's see, each

544
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,060
one is going to be approximately $15, or 1200 Microsoft points, and will be made available

545
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,000
on December 4th as part of the fall update, of course.

546
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,720
The first batch of these games, I guess, and I'm not sure if they're all going to be available

547
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,600
day one, Halo, Psychonauts, Crimson Skies, and Fable.

548
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,320
So those are ones that have been confirmed.

549
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,560
There were some other third party ones that were also reported, which were Indigo Prophecy,

550
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,440
Crash Bandicoot, Wrath of the Cortex, and Burnout 3, which I thought was a pretty good

551
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,400
Burnout game.

552
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,160
Let's see here, also as part of the fall update, of course, that Parental Timer, and then who

553
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,640
knows what else they'll throw in there as well, but that's mainly the big thing.

554
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:57,320
Although if you're expecting some wonderful things from these Xbox originals, time to

555
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,720
kind of calm down a little bit, because they're really just downloadable Xbox games, that's

556
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
it.

557
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,760
I mean, they're emulated through the same software that emulates the current Xbox games

558
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,640
that you can just pop a disk in there, so all the bugs that were in those emulations

559
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,320
are going to be the same thing on these download titles.

560
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,180
So in other words, if you thought Microsoft was going to take the Virtual Console idea

561
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,960
and do it better, wrong.

562
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,200
Yeah, basically, they're going to have choppiness when the game's loading up.

563
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,160
Also if there's content like demos and stuff, selecting them might actually crash the game.

564
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,600
You know, stuff that's on these original Xbox games, so it's really just straight port and

565
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,720
they're just available to download.

566
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,440
No achievements, no nothing.

567
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
So that's it.

568
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,640
It's a little bit of a big deal.

569
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,520
But cool news for people that maybe missed it, because there's some people who didn't

570
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,080
buy an Xbox One who have an Xbox 360, you know what I mean?

571
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,360
So that might be good for them.

572
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,640
So I mean, if you're up to it, they will be made available.

573
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,560
Obviously this is an optional purchase.

574
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,040
You don't necessarily need to buy it, but I don't know.

575
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,920
Now our favorite webmaster in the whole wide world, VXJsonXV, brings up a good point and

576
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,320
says, but they're on the HD, which means they're fast.

577
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,920
HD-based gaming equals heart, heart, heart, heart, heart.

578
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
That's true, right?

579
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,360
If they're on the hard drive, they ought to at least load a little faster, right?

580
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,840
Possibly, but then again, they're being emulated, remember, and emulation can be slower sometimes.

581
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,560
I guess that's true, but they're being emulated anyway if you put a disk in there.

582
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,560
True, yeah.

583
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,040
So I guess versus a disk, it would be a little bit faster.

584
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,360
But still, I probably wouldn't buy these things if I still have the disk sitting around.

585
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Exactly.

586
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,720
The other thing too is some of these games are pretty old.

587
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,120
You can probably find them really cheap if you really wanted to look for them.

588
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,000
Maybe this would be incentive, if they make money off this, maybe this would be incentive

589
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,460
for them to go back in the Xbox archive, because they haven't touched the backwards compatibility

590
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,600
in a long time and made some more games backwards compatible, like DDR, still not backwards

591
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,440
compatible, right?

592
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,000
Maybe this would be incentive for them to go dip in the library and make some old stuff

593
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
backwards compatible.

594
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,480
But I swear to God, if they make things like Silent Hill 2 and Silent... Was Silent Hill

595
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
3 on Xbox?

596
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
I think it was.

597
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,880
I only had 2 and 4, so I don't know.

598
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,440
No, I don't think it was, because I was playing it on PS2.

599
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,920
But my copies vanished probably when I moved, so I would download that shit in a heartbeat,

600
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,720
just to have the load times and stuff.

601
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,520
Some of that stuff is going to be cool, I think.

602
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
We'll see.

603
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,120
Anyhow, one other thing I wanted to mention during housekeeping that I totally forgot,

604
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,840
because we forgot to note it on our little notes thingy internally here, is that this

605
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,240
is great, what's been released from our community.

606
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,720
It's on the forums, and it's something called OL Revolution.

607
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,400
It's basically a step mania pack with all these songs that are based on inside jokes

608
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,000
from the show.

609
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,200
There's some completely horrid stuff in there, like five years ago when we would go on the

610
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,360
stream randomly and I would sing over DDR songs.

611
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,720
People recorded that shit somehow and have stepped it.

612
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,240
And some of those god-awful DMN remixes that he's taken, and I say that with love, that

613
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,320
he's taken bits and pieces of our show and put them over DDR songs, they're all in there

614
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
with steps.

615
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,200
And then things that are in-jokes to other shows on the station, just hilarious.

616
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,660
It's all in the forums, check it out, ask Dark Tetsuya, I think he spearheaded the whole

617
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
thing.

618
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
I just think that was very cool.

619
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,960
I think this has been, what, two years in the making?

620
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,200
It's been a long time in the making, but they even, somebody did the voices, it wasn't us,

621
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,080
but I think it was DMN, I don't know, or Travis, I can't tell, because they actually have somebody

622
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,800
in the opening going, Orange Lounge Revolution.

623
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
That's our Tetsuya.

624
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Is it really?

625
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Yeah, I think so.

626
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
Oh wow.

627
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,800
And they actually have little incidental musics that we use on our station, and some of the

628
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,000
shit I don't even know where they found, but they got it.

629
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,160
So props to them.

630
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,360
But I swear to god, if that shit gets out, that karaoke stuff gets out there too much,

631
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
I'm gonna have issues.

632
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,080
We're gonna have words, Dark Tetsuya, in the parking lot.

633
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
I'll kick your butt in.

634
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Rock Band, which you were talking about a little earlier in the game, and lots and lots

635
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,240
of news coming out on Rock Band as the game gets closer and closer to release, including

636
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,600
information about the download packs, and Rock Band has decided they've gotta stick

637
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,360
it to Guitar Hero 3 by making the packs a little bit cheaper, instead of 500 points

638
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,320
for Guitar Hero 3 packs, 440 Microsoft points.

639
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,280
That equates to, do the math in your head, $5.49.

640
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,760
But you don't just have to buy songs in packs.

641
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,960
You can buy individual songs.

642
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,400
It could go anywhere from 80 Microsoft points to 240 Microsoft points.

643
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,680
That's 99 cents to just under three bucks.

644
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,080
Most of them, they say, will be $1.99, 159 Microsoft points.

645
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,280
159 Microsoft points?

646
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,960
I'm gonna have all these leftover stupid points somewhere.

647
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,000
Just do 160.

648
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,680
And I mean, they have so much stuff coming out just when the game comes out.

649
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,320
They have on November 20th, the Metallica pack, the Police pack, the Queens of the Stone

650
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,760
Age pack, and some individual tracks such as My Sharona and Cherry Bomb.

651
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,600
I would also like to point out that the week of November 27th, while Jamie is gone and

652
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,440
she can't play it, there's a David Bowie pack coming out.

653
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Haha.

654
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
Who says I can't play it?

655
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,960
Are you gonna have Rock Band in Alabama?

656
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Haha.

657
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,400
I really wanna get back.

658
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,840
Black Sabbath pack comes out on December 4th.

659
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,120
That is so getting downloaded.

660
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,520
And December 18th, look at this.

661
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Some individual tracks.

662
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,800
First, you get a Pretender song, Brass in Pocket, Weezer, Buddy Holly, Just For You,

663
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,160
Dark Sakura, God Is Listening, My Iron Lung by Radiohead on December 18th.

664
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Yee!

665
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
There you have it.

666
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I loves me some Radiohead.

667
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,960
But see, it's kinda cool that they have stuff coming out each week.

668
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
That is very cool.

669
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
I hope it continues.

670
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,240
I hope it gets stuff on Christmas.

671
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
We'll see.

672
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,520
I don't know.

673
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,520
I don't wanna buy like some of these.

674
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,000
Fortunate Son actually sounded kinda cool.

675
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,520
I like the fact that they have some individual pricing to it as well.

676
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
That's very cool.

677
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,160
Cuz you got, yeah, not all this I'm gonna wanna buy.

678
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Like, you know, but, yeah.

679
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm very happy.

680
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,360
Well, for anyone who is looking for these on Guitar Hero 3, there is a free Boss Battle

681
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:25,080
download pack that's basically just the devil went down to Georgia and all the other three,

682
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,800
you know, the three Boss Battle songs.

683
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
So that's pretty cool.

684
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,920
But I think that the best part about it is that it's free.

685
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,960
I like free.

686
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Free is good.

687
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,800
So you can play these outside of career mode.

688
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,960
Awesome.

689
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,040
Anyways, something not...

690
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
Wait, wait, wait.

691
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,080
Yeah, I ran out real quick but I wanted to comment on that.

692
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,140
I'm glad they did it for free cuz otherwise we all would have been screaming that it was

693
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,720
pay to unlock content because those songs were kind of already in the game.

694
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,180
But I think it's a nice little extra.

695
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,560
It's nothing huge.

696
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,840
But The Devil Went Down to Georgia is an awesome song so I'm really glad they made that available

697
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,840
to play whenever I want.

698
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
I like that cover.

699
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Yes.

700
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,840
So, good jobs.

701
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Okay, now, Loki, you can go.

702
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:10,640
Anyways, so UK retailer Tesco actually slipped up because on their online store they were

703
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:18,320
selling the Xbox 360 holiday bundle which is normally 340 pounds.

704
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,480
They were selling it for only 33 pounds.

705
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,720
Whoopsie.

706
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:32,300
And apparently it was long enough for a number of customers to order the system and although

707
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,040
Sky News is saying that once the payment is accepted, trading standards rules in the UK

708
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:47,920
state that the retailer must comply and deliver the product, however, they have said despite

709
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,800
the rules, Tesco site maintains that they do not have to conform to erroneously marked

710
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,820
prices unless they fail to notice before shipment.

711
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,200
So they may renege all of it.

712
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,500
That's gonna cause a stink.

713
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,960
But there was apparently some consumers, like one that ordered 39 consoles, although none

714
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,000
of them have been delivered yet, so good job.

715
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
They'd have to do at least a full refund on price.

716
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,640
Yeah, especially like, you know, you consider that guy probably thought he was doing a smart

717
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
thing.

718
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,880
Hopefully they won't try to like charge him for all those Xbox 360s or he's not gonna

719
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
be happy.

720
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,400
I don't think they can do that.

721
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Probably not.

722
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Probably not.

723
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,240
I want to point out in response to the last story, because there's a bit of a delay from

724
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,880
when we say it to one of the live listeners here, ActDeft says, free is good, except for

725
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Yaris.

726
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,600
Good point.

727
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Also

728
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,760
You do pay in time, don't you?

729
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,040
I have more rock band stuff, and this is not gonna be free, sadly, but this sounds like

730
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,600
really cool.

731
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,280
This came from an interview with the official Xbox magazine, and some more details have

732
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,480
surfaced from Harmonix about rock band, and apparently, okay, you're gonna be able to

733
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,240
take your band and export it to a webpage.

734
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,000
And from there, you can take band avatars, pose your band avatars, make album covers

735
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,840
with your band logo, make all these different scenes, and then you can turn that into real

736
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,560
world stuff.

737
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,720
You can make figurines based on these rock band characters, t-shirts that have the fake

738
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,720
album art on them, and then tour dates that are just basically the accomplishments from

739
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
the game.

740
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,480
Oh, I want fucking figures.

741
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,480
That would be awesome.

742
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
I think that's awesome.

743
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
That's a smart idiot.

744
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
It's like Spore.

745
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,880
It's like all that stuff you saw with Spore, like they were gonna let you do the printing

746
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,880
or whatever.

747
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,600
I think somebody saw that and thought that was a great idea.

748
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,320
And you know, I think some of it's probably gonna be kind of junky, like, you know, some

749
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,560
of the blogs have been saying, like, oh, this is basically gonna be, like, cafe e-press

750
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,560
quality.

751
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,200
True, but name me other games that do that.

752
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
There's not a lot.

753
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Well, there is.

754
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
It's still kind of neat.

755
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,720
There is the Madden thing where you can buy a fucking ring for, like, $500.

756
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
That's true.

757
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
That's a little crazy.

758
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,480
I'm excited to see how this plays out, because obviously it's not up there yet, but it must

759
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,640
be coming soon, because the game is out on Tuesday.

760
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,160
I will say, though, there are some pretty interesting, there are some of the load screens

761
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
on there.

762
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,800
They will have fake album art and stuff like that, and fake little, like, portraits and

763
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,000
stuff with your characters that you design in it, like in different poses, which look

764
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
kind of neat.

765
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
I thought the trivia was interesting.

766
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,400
We played the Freeze Pop song, and it said something about Freeze Pop once got arrested

767
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,320
in Canada and ate lots of poutine.

768
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,000
And I was like, that's completely random.

769
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,720
I'm like, wow.

770
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,360
I'm like, do people outside of Canada even know what poutine is?

771
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
I don't think so.

772
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
We'll see.

773
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Anyway.

774
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
I don't know what it is.

775
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
It's basically french fries and gravy.

776
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,680
That sounds really yummy.

777
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,840
I have Canadian friends online that, like, blog about it.

778
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,360
It's so good, apparently.

779
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
I don't know.

780
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,680
I know we've got Canadian listeners.

781
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,600
I kind of do that with my leftover chips from the British food store.

782
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Alright.

783
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
I get it.

784
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,480
I put chip shop curry on it.

785
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,240
Why is it this show always turns into the food show?

786
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Somebody asked me that.

787
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
Because we're hungry.

788
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,040
Did food and gaming go hand in hand like that?

789
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Yes.

790
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Alright.

791
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Anyhow.

792
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:18,160
Well, for other stuff, Rob, for anyone who is familiar with Atlas USA, they are bringing

793
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,800
out Spectro Force 3 and Operation Darkness for Xbox 360, which is pretty cool.

794
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,440
Atlas gave us Trauma Center on Wii, so we are getting their new localizations.

795
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,240
And they made the cute little tactical game with the voice acting on PS2.

796
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
God damn it.

797
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,620
Why can't I think of it?

798
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Really popular.

799
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,620
Just got a sequel recently.

800
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,620
Disgaea.

801
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Thank you, Disgaea.

802
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
Disgaea.

803
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,620
Yeah.

804
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
And Persona.

805
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,620
They made that too.

806
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,620
They published it.

807
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,620
So we're getting more.

808
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
Oh, true.

809
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,620
True.

810
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
Yes.

811
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
They're publishing.

812
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,620
But yeah, we're getting more fun.

813
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
The difference.

814
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,620
My bad.

815
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,320
But I was going to say that Operation Darkness looked like crap, by the way.

816
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,040
It's like, I don't know, it looked dumb from what I remember when they were first showing

817
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,120
video of that.

818
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:14,080
Anywho, so Lionhead, you may remember them from the Fable series, well, they're looking

819
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,120
for some custom insults for Fable 2.

820
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:24,240
So they actually have a whole thing where you can submit your insults to them and apparently

821
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,920
if they like it, they will put it in the game.

822
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,980
So that's kind of neat.

823
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,000
I have one.

824
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Your gameplay makes me want to go play a PlayStation 3.

825
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,960
Is that good?

826
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
No.

827
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:47,160
Some of the ones that they were saying, or that were on there already, Groin Crab, Loner

828
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:55,040
McLonelyton, and Big Girls Blouse, which I don't understand that.

829
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,720
What do you think would happen if I submitted, so they're names to call people?

830
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,880
You know, to be honest, all they need to do is monitor names and little catch phrases

831
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,640
that are in Animal Crossing, because I mean that's what people do anyway.

832
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
Oh, good point.

833
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:20,160
I was going to say like, as a joke, if you're supposed to submit things that are like name

834
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,240
calling or whatever, let's all submit Bobby Black Wolf as a name calling thing.

835
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,040
Funny.

836
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,480
Just kidding, Bobby, if you're listening, all right, moving on.

837
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,440
One thing that they don't want you putting your opinions in and don't want you asking

838
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,840
about anymore is Bioshock on the PlayStation 3.

839
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,360
Damn it, Sony fanboys, 2K Games has given you the smackdown.

840
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,440
It is not happening.

841
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,800
It's an official response on the 2K forums, and this is what the moderator had to say.

842
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,540
Quote, please don't tell me you made an account just for this question.

843
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,720
There will be no PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock.

844
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,360
It has been explained time and time again.

845
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,160
So if you were hoping to save some, what do they call them, little sisters on the PlayStation

846
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,480
3 version?

847
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Not going to happen.

848
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Sorry, kids.

849
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,800
Bioshock 2?

850
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
You never know.

851
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I mean, you know there's got to be a Bioshock 2 at some point.

852
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,760
This game's getting amazing reviews, but Bioshock 2 on the PlayStation 3, well, if there's enough

853
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,000
PlayStation 3s out there, they'll probably do it.

854
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,100
So that's that.

855
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,320
No Bioshock for you PlayStation 3 kids.

856
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,920
But, but, but we like...

857
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
No.

858
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,920
Okay.

859
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,320
Well, they are now putting out something very interesting for PlayStation 3.

860
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,480
I think this is very interesting.

861
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:49,160
Trend Micro Incorporated is putting out antivirus software for the PlayStation 3.

862
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,620
I don't know if that's sort of interesting, but they're saying that the home systems now

863
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,360
are going to be vulnerable to spyware and viruses for being able to go on the internet.

864
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,720
Is that so my PlayStation 3 doesn't get herpes?

865
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
I thought...

866
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,680
I don't know if it's antivirus software, but I think Trend Micro is doing the parental

867
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,040
controls on the internet browser that they're going to add...

868
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,800
I think they've already added them with the last update, but it's basically just parental

869
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
controls, I think.

870
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,880
Yeah, it's to block the sites that are more notorious for providing the...

871
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,480
No porno for you, kiddies.

872
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,000
Well, they're saying that it's blocking malicious websites and also putting in the parental

873
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,520
lock-out.

874
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,440
I think that more parents should be locked out from their PlayStation 3.

875
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,960
I'm kidding.

876
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
Totally not serious.

877
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,120
Well, I used my PlayStation 3 the other day, unfortunately, to watch License to Wed.

878
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
What?

879
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Sad.

880
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,580
Anyways, I got it for free.

881
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,480
So yeah, there was actually something pretty cool, and this is a little bit of a positive

882
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,040
spin on the PlayStation Eye now.

883
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,920
I think the Eye of Judgment is a piece of crap, however, the PlayStation Eye not so

884
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,640
bad because it's just a camera.

885
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,780
But they had a video that was posted on the official Sony blog that was showing off some

886
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,920
of their tech demos that they're making with the PlayStation Eye.

887
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,760
Why the fuck they haven't done this stuff yet?

888
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,640
Because it's actually pretty cool.

889
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:19,120
A guy made a little Lunar Lander kind of game just by drawing something on a piece of paper,

890
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,760
and the PlayStation Eye turned it into a game.

891
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,440
They also had another one that looked kind of like combat on the Atari 2600, but it was

892
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,800
done by scanning in tanks and stuff that you draw.

893
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,880
So I thought all that stuff was pretty cool, and that they should implement that, or at

894
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,360
least put it on their PlayStation Network.

895
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,520
Something to do with the PlayStation Eye.

896
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,800
I think it's good stuff.

897
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:46,160
Hopefully they'll have something later on, like in, say, Little Big Planet, where you

898
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,200
can draw things into the environment.

899
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,360
That would be pretty awesome.

900
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,160
You know, I think this is the problem with all these camera peripherals, peripherals

901
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,500
in general, they come out for like one or two games, and then they're not continued

902
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,320
to be supported, therefore the peripherals never sell.

903
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,400
You have to make a ton of games for the peripherals in order for them to finally sell.

904
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:16,120
Like for example here, the Xbox Vision camera.

905
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,760
That is a piece of useless crap, and I'm sad to have made that mistake twice now with both

906
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,080
the Eye toy and the vision camera.

907
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,720
And that's why I haven't bought a PlayStation Eye yet, because I don't want to buy another

908
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,920
useless camera.

909
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,700
Exactly, like how many things can you use that stupid vision cam for?

910
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:42,400
One to make your own icon on Xbox Live that only your friends can see.

911
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Yay, Totem Ball!

912
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
That game was awesome!

913
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,760
I'm not going to count Totem Ball, because that's something against the Xbox Live camera.

914
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,480
And then there's Strip Uno.

915
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,120
That's it.

916
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,240
That's all the cam is good for.

917
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,800
And they also have strip checkers, strip chests.

918
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,580
And I guess you also have hardwood hearts or whatever, but who plays those games?

919
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,580
Hardwood hearts.

920
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:10,240
But seriously, did you play the Spyglass games or whatever it was called?

921
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
It was kind of crap.

922
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,480
It was kind of sloppy, I don't know.

923
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,340
Just because a game supports the fucking camera, which to be honest, I think all of the games

924
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,840
should support the damn camera.

925
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,800
I don't know.

926
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,560
Jason brings up a point, Texas Hold'em supports it now.

927
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,560
I forgot about that.

928
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
Oh, yay.

929
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,720
That is true.

930
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,600
I haven't played Texas Hold'em in a long time.

931
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,640
Which is too bad, because I think we were invited to a tournament, and that reminds

932
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,360
me, I need to reply to that email, because we're being stuck up by not replying.

933
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,360
My bad.

934
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,760
All right.

935
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,960
But we really suck at Hold'em.

936
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
Is anybody good at Hold'em?

937
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
I was okay.

938
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Really?

939
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,960
You should play for us then.

940
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,960
Not that good.

941
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,640
Well, I'm okay at it.

942
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,640
We could all play.

943
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,960
We could all go to the same place and play together.

944
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,240
I have better things to play.

945
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,840
I played Hold'em once with Bobby for maybe 20 minutes, and that was it.

946
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,840
All right.

947
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,520
Anyhow, very cool news for the PlayStation 3.

948
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,800
Yes, that's right.

949
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,360
Very cool news for the PlayStation 3.

950
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,800
I'm completely serious here.

951
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
What?

952
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
Yeah, I know.

953
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Divx is going to be partnering with Sony.

954
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,860
This is based on an announcement from Divx.

955
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:23,640
They're going to be integrating its video playback technology into the PlayStation 3.

956
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,440
If you update your development kits to 2.0, you can already utilize the Divx technology

957
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,960
for your games, and hopefully, if Divx gets enabled in a future PlayStation 3 firmware

958
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,120
upgrade, which at this point, who's to say why wouldn't it, then you can actually watch

959
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,120
all the porn that you download over the internet and all the pirated movies.

960
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,160
You'll be able to watch that over your local network.

961
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,080
That would be totally useful for someone who pirates.

962
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,200
Not too bad that I will not be using that.

963
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,040
Yes, not that you should be pirating.

964
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,040
That's wrong.

965
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,040
That's wrong.

966
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,840
R. And yeah, you should not be doing that.

967
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,280
R. Well, if it's on the internet, it must be okay to download, right?

968
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,640
I mean, they wouldn't put something illegal on the internet, would they?

969
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,720
No, of course not.

970
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,600
That's just completely...

971
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:17,480
Someone from OL Army Ninja in chat says, did OLR really just go two whole stories about

972
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,080
Sony and not bad talk them?

973
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,720
We said a long time ago, when Sony does something right, we will give them credit for it.

974
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,720
Hey, we're...

975
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,080
And then we'll make fun of them for everything else.

976
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,080
I'm equally offensive against all consoles.

977
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:37,440
For example, this week's live edition, fucking Shrek Enroll and Screwjumper, what the fuck

978
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,160
is that shit?

979
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:45,000
Shrek Enroll, first of all, Shrek should never be on the fucking Xbox Live Arcade ever, and

980
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,440
obviously this game sucks.

981
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,200
You know it was to make it more family friendly.

982
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,200
That was the point.

983
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,200
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, was that really your response to that?

984
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Yeah.

985
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,040
I'll tell you what, THQ needs to make better games then.

986
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,000
That's what needs to happen.

987
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,320
Stop fucking licensing shit and making crap, because that's what's going to happen when

988
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,240
you license shit and get crap.

989
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,880
I would also mean it's not crap.

990
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,200
How about it?

991
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,040
Orange Box, which is not crap.

992
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,480
It is not crap.

993
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,600
It's going to be on PS3 in December for our European fans.

994
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Pretty cool.

995
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,040
You will see it on the 14th of December, to be specific.

996
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,360
It will not be 2008, like the rumors are said, you are going to see it this year.

997
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,360
Great.

998
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,760
And I believe it's on the 12th in the US as well.

999
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,680
But Portal, Portal...

1000
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,080
That is no lie, unlike the cake.

1001
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,080
Portal.

1002
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,600
Yeah, are you saying just buy this game for Portal and the hell with everything else?

1003
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,760
Just buy it for Portal, the hell with everything else.

1004
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,360
Although, I did find a very interesting thing, because I was reading some of the forums about

1005
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,040
it, because people are trying to piece in where Portal is supposed to fit in the Half-Life

1006
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,120
story, which I thought was really cool speculation, because I love speculating about storylines

1007
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,120
and things.

1008
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Well, hold on.

1009
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,120
Are you telling me there's Portal fanfic?

1010
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,120
No.

1011
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,120
It actually does fanfic.

1012
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,440
There is.

1013
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
And there's weighted companion cube fan art.

1014
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,440
Yeah.

1015
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,080
As long as there's not weighted companion cube slash, then we're okay.

1016
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,080
No.

1017
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:18,520
No, but I was reading just how they were speculating how it fitted in, and someone was saying that

1018
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:25,200
there's a way that you can import the Half-Life 2 maps into Portal, and you can use the Portal

1019
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,440
gun in Half-Life 2.

1020
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,680
I think it's the other way around.

1021
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,680
You import...

1022
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,600
No, it was saying specifically that they moved the maps to the Portal folder.

1023
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,560
It was using some program or something.

1024
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:40,620
I think it's the other way around, they imported the Portal gun into Half-Life 2, but yeah,

1025
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,620
you can do that.

1026
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:47,560
Anyways, I was going to say there is, if you notice in the game, actually there's a few

1027
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,720
times where you can see through the window, and there's a little slide projector.

1028
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,960
They're showing Aperture Science versus, I don't remember what the other corporation

1029
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:04,040
is in Half-Life 2, so forgive me there, but a whole little thing about that, I guess they're

1030
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,840
making competing technologies and stuff, and it's even in the song too.

1031
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,680
They're talking about that whole thing.

1032
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,360
Why are people in the chat saying Rule 34 and laughing?

1033
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,840
Is that a Portal joke that I don't get?

1034
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,480
I don't know.

1035
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,160
I still haven't played it.

1036
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,920
Maybe I'll download it on Steam this week.

1037
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
We'll see.

1038
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,360
I can't tear myself away from the MMOs long enough.

1039
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,880
Forgive me.

1040
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,720
This is Creed, it's quite interesting.

1041
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,720
There's been reports coming out now that the PlayStation 3 version, let's see here, oh

1042
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,760
I'm sorry that's your story, never mind, PlayStation Store updates, yes.

1043
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,960
Lots of cool stuff for the PlayStation Store this week, including actually one that I was

1044
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,880
kind of looking at, although I played something very similar to it, I want to say it was actually

1045
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,120
on the PlayStation Network, Toy Home, it's a little car racing game, kind of like Micro

1046
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,040
Machines or something like that, you can play that.

1047
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,800
High Velocity Bowling, they have a trailer for that.

1048
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,560
There is a demo now for Uncharted Drake's Fortune, so that's worth checking out, I actually

1049
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,840
got some good reviews, and then of course trailers for Ratchet and Clank Future, and

1050
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:21,500
Time Shift, and Time Crisis 4, oh and Battlefield, Bad Company, and Burnout Paradise.

1051
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:31,600
Let's see here, then other than that, there's also a demo for Blazing Angels 2, okay I guess,

1052
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:38,960
and then finally, un-game related videos, including The Dark Knight, which is just the

1053
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:47,360
teaser trailer, and This Christmas, and Remember That Night.

1054
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,200
The Dark Knight teaser trailer kind of sucks, I don't know if you've seen it, there's nothing

1055
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,160
to it, that's the problem, I am so freaking ready for this movie, I can't wait to freaking

1056
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,080
see it, it looks so awesome, but that trailer sucked, it didn't tell you anything, I had

1057
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,720
some crappy voiceovers and a spinning card, whoopee doo, oh how would you download that?

1058
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:13,640
There's also some Uncharted wallpapers, but no themes yet, so, hooray.

1059
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:19,060
Anyhow, you might want to watch out for this though, or maybe you won't get to access that

1060
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:25,100
PlayStation store, and that is the brand newly discovered White Screen of Death on the PlayStation

1061
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:33,840
3, and the cause, Assassin's Creed, apparently some folks who are using firmware 2.0 are

1062
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:39,000
getting the White Screen of Death while playing Assassin's Creed, this is coming up on posts

1063
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:46,040
on the Ubisoft forums, and apparently there's a lot of folks that are posting about these

1064
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:54,080
freezing issues and bug glitch issues, so there you have it, no real answer as to what

1065
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,760
exactly causes this, it seems to be somewhat random, but they're saying it also has some

1066
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,560
frame rate problems, screen tearing, geometry clipping, and lockups.

1067
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:10,080
The game actually had a worse frame rate slightly than the Xbox 360 version, and there's also

1068
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,720
some videos online of some pretty weird glitches in the game, like one where you fall through

1069
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,960
the earth, there's another one where your character kind of clones himself, and so you're

1070
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,320
controlling two copies of your character.

1071
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,600
Now someone on my friends list played both, and actually said the PlayStation 3 is a little

1072
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:35,000
better, so maybe if these issues don't come to haunt you, then you're fine, it doesn't

1073
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
matter.

1074
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,720
I was going to say also that the game ain't that good, that's another thing.

1075
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
You didn't like it really?

1076
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
No.

1077
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,720
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

1078
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,720
I've played a little bit of it.

1079
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,400
I haven't played it yet, but a lot of people are really liking it.

1080
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
What else was I going to say about that?

1081
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,920
What is it you don't like about it?

1082
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,920
It's boring.

1083
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,920
Really?

1084
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
It really is.

1085
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,920
It's not as...

1086
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,920
You're going to kill people.

1087
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,720
Okay, well that's like any game.

1088
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,660
So I don't know, I just didn't care for it.

1089
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,360
I didn't see what the fuss was about.

1090
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,360
Alright.

1091
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:13,840
Well, there was a rumor circulating around that Capcom was thinking about putting a Resident

1092
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:21,060
Evil 5 demo on the Blu-Ray for Resident Evil Extinction, and also another one saying that

1093
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,760
Devil May Cry 4 would have a demo on there, but Capcom said, uh-uh, they're just putting

1094
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,760
trailers up.

1095
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,040
That would have been so cool, though.

1096
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,040
I know.

1097
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,960
I think there's a lot of people very excited about Resident Evil 5.

1098
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,080
Capcom should do it.

1099
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,080
The demo is a lie.

1100
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:43,520
They should put a really crappy demo for something, just have a stick figure with a head.

1101
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,680
They should put Doom on there.

1102
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,120
Yet another bastardization of Mega Man.

1103
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:53,960
No, they should do Resident Evil with Doom graphics, with all pixel.

1104
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
I like this.

1105
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,220
Odd1InChat says, God, I need that Resident Evil 5 demo.

1106
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,440
Notice how it's not like, I want, I wish they would put it out there, he says, I need it.

1107
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,080
I need it now.

1108
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,800
I need Animal Crossing Wii, but I'm just going to have to wait a little longer.

1109
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,800
Life sucks.

1110
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,800
Wait.

1111
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,280
Well, what is it, Dennis Leary says, life sucks, wear a helmet.

1112
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,280
Life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up.

1113
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,280
That's all I know.

1114
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,300
Anyways, well, there's a few games, though, that you're not going to have to wait much

1115
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,860
longer to play, and that's the stuff coming out this week.

1116
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:32,260
So in the US, starting off here- Dear God Friday.

1117
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,260
I know, oh my God, the release dates for Japan are here.

1118
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,480
Everybody, give sympathy to our- Everybody, get a book, get a pillow, we're

1119
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,240
going to have a long segment for release dates.

1120
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,960
Everybody feel sorry for our retail workers this Friday.

1121
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,360
No, that's not going to be a long segment, actually, there's not a lot coming out this

1122
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
week.

1123
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
Oh my God.

1124
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,360
The Japanese ones is huge.

1125
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,800
Anyways, I was just going to mention, I think this came out last week already, and I have

1126
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,360
a kind of a last minute story about it later on.

1127
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,600
Avatar, the Burning Earth, now the new record holder for the fastest way to get achievements

1128
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
on Xbox 360.

1129
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,600
Hooray.

1130
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,720
So that's coming out now.

1131
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,440
Baby Pals on the DS, yes, it's another fucking baby raising sim.

1132
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,440
Wait, did you say baby raising?

1133
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
Or baby racing?

1134
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Raising.

1135
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
Dude, they should tell me baby racing.

1136
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Oh my God, a baby racing game?

1137
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,440
That would be awesome.

1138
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,320
A baby racing game would be hardcore, I'd buy that shit.

1139
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,200
Developers, are you listening?

1140
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,200
Baby racing.

1141
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,960
More babies.

1142
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,440
Babies versus kittens.

1143
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,680
Who will win?

1144
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,760
Anyways, Cabela's Monster Bass, it's a bass fishing game on the PlayStation 2.

1145
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,640
College Hoops 2K8 is coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and 360 this week.

1146
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:49,880
CSI Dark Motives, CSI game on the DS, apparently a venture game, kind of crappy.

1147
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,440
The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific, another piece of shovelware on PlayStation

1148
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,680
2, PlayStation 3.

1149
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,240
Did you call that shovelware?

1150
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,240
Yeah.

1151
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,240
What does that mean?

1152
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,240
It means it's crap.

1153
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,240
Oh.

1154
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,240
Anyways.

1155
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:08,480
No, actually, it's on PlayStation 2 this week because the other games got delayed.

1156
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:14,400
Imagine Fashion Designer on the PC, yes, you too can design crap.

1157
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,760
Mario Party DS, that's going to be a good game, so pick that one up.

1158
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,560
Medal of Honor Airborne for the PlayStation 3, I guess better late than never.

1159
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,040
Monster Jam on the Wii, same there.

1160
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,040
Let's see.

1161
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,800
Genesis 4, which is including the GunCon, that's going to be coming out on the PlayStation

1162
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,360
3, so it might be worth picking up if you like gun games.

1163
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,540
Unreal Tournament 3, coming out on PC, so that should be pretty awesome.

1164
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,840
No word on the PlayStation 3 version yet.

1165
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,760
Let's see.

1166
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,400
World of Warcraft, March of the Legion, the card game, I don't know if anyone's interested

1167
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,560
in the World of Warcraft card game.

1168
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:01,780
Let's see here, Soldier of Fortune Payback on the PlayStation 3 actually got delayed

1169
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,320
to this week, which I thought was kind of interesting.

1170
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:10,780
AMF Bowling Pin Busters on the Wii, I don't know if this is a good game or not, but it's

1171
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:17,220
only 20 bucks, so if you like bowling and you're a little tired of Wii Sports bowling,

1172
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,320
might want to check that out.

1173
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:25,640
And then finally, Final Fantasy Online, they have the Vanadil Collection 2008 on PlayStation

1174
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,880
2 and Xbox 360, which is going to include, of course, all the previous expansions, the

1175
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,600
original game, and of course, the other thing that's coming out this week, the Final Fantasy

1176
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,200
11 Online Wings of the Goddess expansion, which should make some people happy.

1177
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,200
Yay!

1178
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,200
Let's see then.

1179
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,200
Oh, and that's also coming out on PC as well.

1180
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:53,800
Then on the DS, John Deere Harvest in the Heartland.

1181
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,920
It's a farming sim for real.

1182
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,360
Take that, Harvest Moon.

1183
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:07,520
Luxor Pharaoh's Challenge on PlayStation 2, that'll probably suck.

1184
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,640
Ghost Squad on the Wii, which I highly recommend you pick up.

1185
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,140
That's only $29.99, so definitely a great gun game for the Wii, and also uses the Wii

1186
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:19,080
Zapper, which is also coming out this week.

1187
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,560
Soul Calibur Legends, which I heard sucked, has come out on the Wii.

1188
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:28,600
Rock Band, of course, probably the biggest game this week on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360,

1189
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,720
both the special edition and the game only.

1190
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,280
And then Showtime Boxing on the Wii also sucked.

1191
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,200
Star Trek Conquest on PlayStation 2 also sucked.

1192
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:45,880
Strawberry Shortcake, the Four Seasons cake, probably also sucks.

1193
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,600
Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, that game's pretty good on the DS.

1194
00:58:50,600 --> 00:59:01,940
Godzilla Unleashed also sucked, and I believe that is it.

1195
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,520
And you said there's not a lot coming out this week, come on, that took like five minutes.

1196
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,560
That's because I'm slow.

1197
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,480
Coming out over on the Japanese shores, Final Fantasy XI Wings of the Goddess comes out

1198
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,840
for Xbox 360 this week on November 22nd.

1199
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,560
I think it has a different name in Japan, though.

1200
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,960
We're calling it Wings of the Goddess over here, but I want to say it's called Altana's

1201
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,320
Heroes or something like that over there, I can't remember.

1202
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,040
Anyhow, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix finally makes its way to the Xbox

1203
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,560
360 as well this week in Japan.

1204
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,840
Also coming out, Medal of Honor Airborne, also for the 360, and another 360 game, and

1205
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,120
you didn't think there was anything for the 360 in Japan.

1206
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,340
Winning XI 2008 makes its way to Japan.

1207
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:49,160
Coming to the Wii this week in Japan, Dragon Blade comes out.

1208
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:55,560
This is from D3, is publishing this, and yep, looks like another role-playing game.

1209
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,720
It's an action game like God of War, it's a rip-off of God of War, but it's not even

1210
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,760
close to being as good as God of War.

1211
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,960
Interesting because from the box art and everything, it looks like your typical RPG, but there

1212
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,960
you have it.

1213
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,960
My own Sonic at the Olympics makes its way to Japan, also on the Wii this week, the 22nd.

1214
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,240
Coming out on PlayStation 3, another version of Harry Potter, because of course those games

1215
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,040
come out on every console.

1216
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:23,760
Also Remi no Oishi Restaurant, which you know better on these shores as Ratatouille, that

1217
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,160
movie Ratatouille, whatever, how do you say that, I don't even know.

1218
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,480
PlayStation 2 gets a reduction in price on all of the Fatal Frame games this week, so

1219
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,440
if you miss the Fatal Frame series, now's your chance.

1220
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,000
Also coming out, another version of Wings of the Goddess for Final Fantasy XI hits the

1221
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,920
PlayStation 2 as well, because they say in Japan most players are on the PS2, because

1222
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,280
that's where the game came out first.

1223
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:56,120
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Pre-Saga, Princess Osagasi, that's coming out from Able,

1224
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:02,220
and it's an adventure game involving princesses, hooray!

1225
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:08,440
Also coming out, Umisho, the limited edition, an adventure game coming out as well, I'm

1226
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,440
trying to see if we have any, no, but it looks like it's based around the swimming team,

1227
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,980
is this an anime I don't know about, probably, probably.

1228
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,800
Also coming out on the DS, Dragon Quest IV, this isn't the new one, but this is a remake

1229
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,860
of the old school Dragon Quest IV, so check that out on the DS, and yes, it looks like

1230
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:30,900
it takes full advantage of the dual screen capabilities, for instance when you're battling

1231
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,380
your party status shows on the top screen, and the monsters that you're fighting and

1232
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,680
all the different commands show up on the bottom screen.

1233
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:41,740
If you were hoping to import that one, I hope you read Japanese fluently, because there's

1234
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,120
no Engrish in it.

1235
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:52,340
Also coming out on the DS, Uno Ikusi, IQ Breeder is coming out, and it looks like something

1236
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:58,440
between a dog sim and a brain training game, so that's great, take your two biggest DS

1237
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:04,200
games, cram them together, and you have this game, lovely, maybe it's where you beat the

1238
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:11,660
dog until it's smart, I somehow doubt that, aww, alright, there it is, your Japanese releases.

1239
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:17,940
Puppies, okay, well there's a crap load of stuff coming out in the UK, on the 22nd we

1240
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:27,140
have Final Fantasy XI, Wings of the Goddess, yay, Smarty Pants on Wii, 23rd Ace Combat

1241
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:30,740
6, Fires of Liberation, which actually is not all that great, I will just tell you that

1242
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:39,020
from experience, Beowulf, Blazing Angels, Secret Missions of World War II, Code Lyoko,

1243
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:45,580
I guess, CSI Crime Scene Investigation, Hard Evidence, Dewey's Adventure, Ferrari Challenge

1244
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:51,060
on Wii and DS, Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock on a bunch of stuff, Jackass the Game, Juice

1245
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:57,540
2, Hot Import Nights, Kane and Lynch, Deadman, Lair, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games,

1246
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:03,660
Mass Effect, Medal of Honor, Heroes 2, My Horse and Me, I just think that's a funny

1247
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:15,860
name, oh, how can I forget Mass Effect, Boo Loki, Boo You, whatever, NBA 2K8, Need for

1248
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:23,740
Speed Pro Street, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Supreme Commander, Forged Alliance, Siphon Filter,

1249
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:30,820
Logan's Shadow, Time Crisis 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Warhammer 40K, Squad Command, I hate Warhammer.

1250
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,540
Oh, we got some stories in there you'll like later.

1251
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,540
Is that it?

1252
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,540
Yeah.

1253
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,540
Wow.

1254
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:40,620
You just threw that mic down at the mere mention of Warhammer.

1255
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,140
The fuck is Warhammer shit?

1256
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,140
Okay, it's the case it goes.

1257
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:47,460
Bad memories of Warhammer.

1258
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:48,460
Do share.

1259
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,940
I dated a guy who was a Warhammer player and all he did was play Warhammer.

1260
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:58,220
Replace Warhammer with World of Warcraft and you have a lot of relationships in this day

1261
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,220
and age.

1262
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,900
He would spend hours painting his stupid little models and where the stupid little models

1263
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,820
were kind of cool, I was like, dude, you are too obsessed with this shit.

1264
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:12,820
I got too bored with painting the models so I just, you know.

1265
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,380
The models suck, they're like a few millimeters tall, I was like, fuck, I can't paint this

1266
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:18,380
shit.

1267
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:25,700
My dog ended up eating a lot of them anyways, so, wow, but they were cool, yeah, for a while.

1268
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,780
Anyways, one thing that's also cool, although it's a little late for it about now, is a

1269
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:32,020
new Terminator game.

1270
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:37,140
Yeah, Halcon is adapting Terminator for a brand new game, hopefully it's not based off

1271
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,980
the new Terminator series, which I'm sure is going to blow, but I'm sure tons, I was

1272
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,620
just going to say this Terminator thing comes just in time for the Sarah Connor Chronicles,

1273
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:50,420
which I'm sure tons of people will be watching this winter on FOX during the writer's strike.

1274
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:56,140
Yes, Sarah Connor Chronicles, it's like, yeah, it's going to be a Terminator movie without

1275
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,140
the Terminator.

1276
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:02,140
Oh, but there's a chick who's a Terminator also, and she's, it's like, seriously.

1277
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:06,600
But the chick Terminator was in Firefly and therefore it does have a couple points of

1278
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,060
win attached.

1279
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:14,500
It's fucking emo shit, just like goddamn, was it Smallville or something like that,

1280
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:19,260
where they just, oh, there's Terminators coming after me, it's like, seriously, they're just

1281
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,580
going to keep coming after you until you die, so get used to it.

1282
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:28,060
It also has the, you better not make my character gay kid from Heroes in it, who was then written

1283
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,060
out of the show.

1284
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,060
Remember that?

1285
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,980
The management was like, found the scripts where he was supposed to be gay and then like,

1286
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:36,660
no, you need to write that he's in love with the cheerleader, and then he was in the show.

1287
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:40,540
Why don't the Terminators go back in time, like way back in time, to like the Civil War

1288
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:45,240
era and kill like their great, great, great, great grandparents or something like that,

1289
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,240
you know?

1290
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,940
Pick a fight with something, fuck, they can't even kill someone back in like the 80s and

1291
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:52,860
shit with their superior technology.

1292
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,860
Lame.

1293
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:59,860
Anyways, so yeah, they're developing a game, it's going to be a Terminator game, and no

1294
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:04,860
word on what the hell it is, but it's not going to come out until mid-2009, it's also

1295
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:11,840
I guess based on their upcoming film, Terminator Salvation, the future begins, lame!

1296
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,220
But that's going to be coming out later.

1297
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:17,780
I love this comment from Odd1 in our chat room, who's making a lot of win comments tonight,

1298
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,780
good job.

1299
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,340
Odd1 says, Terminator without the Terminator, great.

1300
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:29,980
Next up, Star Wars without lightsabers, and Doctor Who based in South Central LA.

1301
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:36,700
There you have it, Doctor Who-ed, Doctor Who-ed.

1302
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:37,700
That's not funny.

1303
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:39,720
Yes it is, you're smiling.

1304
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,180
By the way, did you know I have to play Doctor Who this weekend at the show?

1305
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,020
I need to go out and buy some Converse this weekend.

1306
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:49,020
It kept going back and forth, I was going to be Professor X, not Doctor Who.

1307
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:52,700
Go to Payless and get air walks, they're more comfortable.

1308
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:53,700
We'll see.

1309
01:06:53,700 --> 01:07:02,380
Anyhow, I just think the Terminator comment's great.

1310
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,220
I know why they announced that they're making a new Terminator game to build off the hype

1311
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:11,260
of other announcements out there, but I mean, how can you get excited about a game that's

1312
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:15,740
going to come out for two years about the Terminator, unless fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger

1313
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,900
is going to be back into it, which he's not because he's in the fucking political game

1314
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,900
now.

1315
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,780
I don't know.

1316
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,780
I just can't get all excited.

1317
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:27,820
I mean, seriously, what good Terminator games have there been out there, excluding the Terminator

1318
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:33,180
the Arcade game, which was Terminator 2 the Arcade game, which was okay as a gun game,

1319
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,900
but really it wasn't that great.

1320
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:41,140
Alright, well maybe the Terminator 4 game will make its way to GameTap in the near future,

1321
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,980
because that's probably the only way I'll actually pay to play it.

1322
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:49,060
GameTap, by the way, passed a huge milestone this week, one thousand games now available

1323
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,260
on the service.

1324
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:52,320
What was the one thousandth game?

1325
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,900
A big one, one that I need to go play right now.

1326
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,960
I need to stop the show right now and go play this game.

1327
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:01,980
Civilization 4 was the one thousandth game, which is, you know, if you've listened to

1328
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:05,540
this game for any length of time, you know I have a lot of love for the very first Civilization

1329
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,540
game, and the others that have come out since then have kind of turned me off, and for that

1330
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:13,500
I never touched Civ 4, but I need to go give it a try now, because I have been playing

1331
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,500
GameTap.

1332
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,580
I definitely want to go check that out.

1333
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,820
The other ones are just too complicated.

1334
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,660
I liked my Civ Simple, which Civ 1 was.

1335
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:25,020
So anyhow, for the record, when the service started, there were only 300 games available

1336
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,020
on it.

1337
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,840
Now there are a thousand.

1338
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,980
So on GameTap.com is the information on all the games that are on the service, plus this

1339
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:36,620
interesting little, you know, picture.

1340
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:39,920
You know those big pictures that are made up of little pictures?

1341
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,920
They have one of those.

1342
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,920
A mosaic?

1343
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:42,920
Thank you, a mosaic.

1344
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,720
The word escaped me.

1345
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,220
They have that, but you can do a mouseover on all the little box arts and see what games

1346
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,220
they are.

1347
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,940
Yay, box art!

1348
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:57,420
That's exactly what I said, yay box art.

1349
01:08:57,420 --> 01:09:02,220
All right, anyhow, we are winding down part A of our show tonight, but we can't finish

1350
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,100
up until we have Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1351
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,420
Yes, it's a way to pay homage to our elders, and from what I understand, because Dark Sakura

1352
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:14,900
is leaving us for a couple weeks, she had to really pick a doozy to leave us with.

1353
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:21,740
So here it is, Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1354
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:27,580
For the Classic Game of the Week, I have picked my favorite ever game, which everybody knows

1355
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,420
me knows what my favorite game is, I picked The Guardian Legend.

1356
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,900
When?

1357
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:33,900
The Guardian Legend.

1358
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:37,480
I'll bring up some gameplay clips right now.

1359
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:45,940
So The Guardian Legend is basically a game where you fly into, you know, the planet's

1360
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:52,780
name is Naju, N-A-J-U, and it starts off as a shooter, and then it's like an adventure

1361
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,580
RPG sort of thing.

1362
01:09:54,580 --> 01:10:01,160
And you talk to these little guys called Blue Landers, who look a lot like Lolo, and it's

1363
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:05,380
basically as you're going through it, you know, you have to pick up your power-ups,

1364
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:11,740
you actually, as your score goes up, you earn, you know, different other power-ups and more

1365
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:17,900
chips, is how your life is, is how your power-ups are stored, and then you earn more life too

1366
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,340
as you go through the game until you're like the super-powered badass.

1367
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:28,020
And there were a couple of neat glitches in the game, one of them where if you had a barrier

1368
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,620
up the middle, if you held diagonally, you could actually sort of walk through the barrier,

1369
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,380
which was my favorite trick to use also.

1370
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,100
You also had, well this is in the glitch, but you had TGL mode, where it had this insane

1371
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,380
password system, it was just crazy.

1372
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:47,620
And although one time I actually put in one randomly and it took me to the end of the

1373
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:55,580
game, so that was kind of cool, but you put in TGL, all in caps, and you play through

1374
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:59,640
the entire game as a shooter, it gives you your power-ups in between, but it's very challenging

1375
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,640
to do that.

1376
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,900
It's really a challenge.

1377
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:05,940
And I'm glad you didn't use this one video file that I linked you to, because that person

1378
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,140
could not play the first level for shit.

1379
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,140
No.

1380
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:13,660
I did my own searching around YouTube to find this clip, it's a little better.

1381
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,340
So here's some overworld music, and then I'm going to switch to Jamie's favorite song in

1382
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,340
the game.

1383
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,340
Yeah.

1384
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,340
I'll tell you a little bit of it.

1385
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,140
The one cool thing about this is, for anyone who doesn't know too much about it, the original

1386
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:32,740
game was actually on the MSX called Gardick, and this is actually the sequel to that Gardick

1387
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:38,500
Gaiden, which was what it was called in Japan.

1388
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:44,740
It's also put out by Compile that gave us a bunch of really, really cool games.

1389
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:49,860
Actually another one of my favorite shooters was Robo-Eleste, which is, you know, they

1390
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:54,300
just did a whole crap ton of shooters.

1391
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,460
This is somebody shooting the gun repeatedly to open the corridor, because every corridor

1392
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:00,540
had its own little trick to open it.

1393
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,680
Let me actually switch, I'm going to switch to the music that Jamie says is her favorite

1394
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,180
in the game, which is the music to Corridor Number 6.

1395
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,180
Here's the overworld music after that.

1396
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,180
Oh, it's the overworld music after this.

1397
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:12,180
The overworld music, yeah.

1398
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:13,980
Oh, this music's good, too.

1399
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,100
I like this one, too, but the overworld music was my favorite.

1400
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,920
Let me go ahead, I'll skip ahead a little bit in the video.

1401
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,920
Not that one.

1402
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,920
Oh, damn it.

1403
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,920
It was right before that.

1404
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,920
It was right before this?

1405
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:28,900
I think it's right after here.

1406
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,140
That's the destruction of Corridor 15.

1407
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,940
Sadly, this game is not on a virtual console, I'm sad to say.

1408
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,140
It needs to be.

1409
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:38,100
This game is freaking great.

1410
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,380
I love this game.

1411
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:40,380
I mean, there's no...

1412
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,380
This is the music I like.

1413
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:53,140
Oh, I remember this one.

1414
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,660
You know, I love this game.

1415
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,660
There's no easy way to say it.

1416
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:57,060
I don't know what it is about this game.

1417
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,300
I think it's the fact that it's a little bit of everything, which for the ADD gamer like

1418
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:08,500
me is wonderful, and I don't know what we have to do to get a sequel to this game that

1419
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,500
doesn't suck.

1420
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:14,220
I realize there might be licensing issues and who owns the works and such and such,

1421
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,980
but my God, I beg you, if you're out there and you have the power to make a sequel to

1422
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,180
this game happen, that doesn't suck.

1423
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,900
It would technically be the third trilogy, then.

1424
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:27,100
I guess that's true, because you do count Gartic, but Gartic, it's not nearly as memorable

1425
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,100
as this game.

1426
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,780
If you've seen Gartic, it's not that exciting.

1427
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,300
This really took it to a whole new level.

1428
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:37,500
Well, there is actually another glitch in the game, and I had actually remembered this

1429
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,860
because I had a glitched copy, my very first one was.

1430
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:46,100
If you got your score to 10 million points, the game would crash and you couldn't play

1431
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,100
any more.

1432
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,100
Oh.

1433
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:53,740
So the later releases would only let you go up to a maximum score of 9,999,990, because

1434
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:57,320
the points were all multiples of 10.

1435
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:01,380
And for anyone who's a big fan of the compiled games, the Blue Landers, actually one of their

1436
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:05,100
mascots, was also in the Sega Master System game called Glovellius.

1437
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,100
Nice.

1438
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,060
So there you go.

1439
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:13,420
Yes, it was not made by Square, Chatroom, this is compiled, published by Broderbund

1440
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,420
here in the US.

1441
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,420
Yep.

1442
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,420
So there you have it.

1443
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:20,180
And because none of those companies exist anymore, that's why it's sadly unlikely we're

1444
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:24,540
going to see this, but possibly this game could make its way to Virtual Console, only

1445
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:28,860
based on the fact that Lode Runner was also a Broderbund game, and that did come out on

1446
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,580
Virtual Console for TurboGrafx.

1447
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:34,860
So you never know, nothing is impossible, I suppose.

1448
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:39,500
But this is one of my, not only does Jamie love this game, I do too, I don't know how

1449
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,860
Loki feels about it, but he better like it, or he's fired.

1450
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:45,660
So there you go.

1451
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,460
Classic game of the week, Guardian Legend.

1452
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,460
Well done.

1453
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:54,220
Alright, well with that, we are going to wrap up Part A of tonight's show, and we'll be

1454
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:59,300
back in a little bit with Part B of Orange Lounge Radio, just in time for Thanksgiving

1455
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,340
for those folks listening on the podcast.

1456
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:05,860
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1457
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,860
a week.

1458
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:33,420
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
