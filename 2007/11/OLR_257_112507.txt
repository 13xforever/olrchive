Tonight, November 25th, 2007, Guitar Hero gets sued for sounding too good, Super Mario Galaxy has super sales, and Captain Kirk officially endorses World of Warcraft.
Hello, everybody out there on the Internet.
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that video game program dedicated, of course, to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Joining me not tonight is DarkSakura.
She has the night off.
She's off for the holidays in Alabama.
We might hear from her a little bit later, though.
We'll see.
But joining us in studio, say hello to the one and only Loki.
Hello.
How are you doing, Loki?
I'm doing fine.
All right.
And since we had an extra seat tonight, we thought we'd bring back
A familiar guest for those that have been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for some time.
Say hello to Intern Drew is here tonight.
What's up, guys?
How you doing?
Ah, fair.
Good.
So, Drew, since DarkSakura's not here tonight, we are going to be relying on you to present the female perspective of gaming.
Wouldn't that be your job, Rob?
Um, no.
What are you trying to imply?
Trying to say something?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.
That's what I thought.
All right.
Let's get us started tonight.
We're going to talk about how is your gaming week.
And since Jamie's not here, we'll start with Loki.
Um, well, let's see.
My gaming week was not filled with Rock Band.
You'd be surprised.
I didn't really play Rock Band this week.
Instead, like Guitar Hero and all the other music games before them, they are sitting in a nice bundle in a box or whatever in the corner of the room while I play other things.
Um, we played actually some Project Gotham Racing 3 this week.
We did a little multiplayer on that.
Wait, Project Gotham Racing 3?
Three.
Old school.
Well, it's the reason why we played that one instead of 4 is because I have 5 copies of Project Gotham Racing 3 and not 5 copies of Project Gotham Racing 4.
Makes it a little difficult to play that game multiplayer otherwise.
Anyways, so we did that, and then Saints Row, of course, as usual.
And a little bit of Call of Duty 4 multiplayer, which is fun.
A little bit of Catan, because that's also fun.
and then the game I've been mainly playing the last few days is Zelda Phantom Hourglass because I, you know, originally I had a DS and then it was a nice, you know, silver fat one, you know, like it came out at launch and then the music came on and everything went to hell.
I swear to God, everything's broken tonight.
Those who are listening live tonight, we had to do three retakes to start the show tonight.
It's like Jamie's not here.
It all falls apart.
I don't know what the hell's going on.
Sorry.
Here we go again.
Anyways...
So then, let's see, so yeah, basically ended up trading my silver DS fat for a pink DS light for my wife, and then I bought a non-pink DS light for myself, a black one, so now I have my true official game for myself, because my wife has claimed all the other ones.
What else did I play this week?
I think that's
I imagine because of the holidays and all, everybody's gaming weeks was a little bit abbreviated.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
Did you have a good turkey day?
Uh, yeah, we had two turkeys.
Pig?
No, no, no, no.
We did not eat two turkeys.
We had two turkeys.
I see.
One of them was at the table.
No, we had, we had, um, because it's an interesting story.
It's like, um,
We had Thanksgiving over at Nellie's parents' house, and they had bought a turkey, and then Nellie's dad won a turkey at work.
The ironic thing is he doesn't like turkey, but he won one anyways, so they had two turkeys there.
You know, that's funny, because I don't like turkey either, so they always have to make ham.
You know, turkey's not bad.
It's just like, I don't want to... They were trying to feed me tons of that turkey, and I'm like...
I'm not eating all that.
Oh, then they wanted me to carve the turkey.
I'm like, I don't know how to fucking carve a turkey.
I'll give it my best try, but shit.
So yeah, that was my gaming week.
Nice.
Drew, intern Drew, you want to go next?
Sure.
Actually, I haven't been playing much World of Warcraft since my subscription expired.
Cry.
But surprisingly, I've been involved in FPS.
I've been playing Battlefield 2 and getting my ranking up.
All the way to Sergeant so far, which is kind of cool.
I like playing a medic.
Other than that, second playthrough of Tales of Symphonia, catching in some Twilight Princess and a little Wild Arms 4.
Not much spectacular, but it's fun stuff.
Alrighty.
My gaming week.
Let's see.
I've been playing the brand new Final Fantasy XI expansion, Wings of the Goddess, which...
Dear Square Enix, I mean, you really blew it with this.
I mean, I don't know what to say.
Now, the game itself is cool.
Let me get to that in a minute.
I'm talking about the launch.
Okay, when you have an MMO and you're going to launch an expansion, you can expect that, like, all your freaking players who are addicted to this game, especially Final Fantasy XI people who are pretty rabid about Final Fantasy XI, are going to be in on this game trying to register the game.
You can expect they're going to all be on at once.
And so what happens?
Their registration servers go down.
DarkSakura.com
Stuck at authenticating.
Well, basically, it was just lots of people were hammering the servers and it was basically breaking it.
Or they just thought that your copy was not authentic enough.
Well, I'm looking right at it.
Does this not look like the real deal?
Hello?
That looks like the real deal forgery to me.
Here's the thing.
Here's the other thing is that the PC version of the game was delayed.
The game was supposed to hit shelves on what, like Tuesday or, no, ship Tuesday to shelf Wednesday, right?
And then what happens?
The PC version gets delayed by a day, which means that in reality it didn't come out on Thanksgiving, obviously.
It came out on Black Friday.
Rob.
What?
What Final Fantasy game would it be if it weren't delayed a little bit?
But the fun thing is, it was only the PC version in the US that got delayed.
So everybody's playing Dancer and Scholar, all the people in Japan and Europe are playing the new classes, and all the PC players are just...
Tear.
But I mean, this is how rabid people are, okay?
You look at the Final Fantasy XI forums, and people are like, okay, here's what you can do.
You can go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game.
This is a real threat I saw on Wednesday, the workaround.
Go out and buy an Xbox 360 version of the game.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Fucking addicts, just wait your turn.
We have to wait for our... This is what I finally decided to do, is wait.
I guess people are still having problems getting on there.
I did finally get my copy registered yesterday.
I guess they fixed some servers, but they kind of botched the launch.
As for the game itself, I was kind of hoping for a little bit more for the users that are not at the endgame level yet, like me, because I've been playing this game for how many years yet?
I can never seem to level a job past like 55, because I have extreme ADD.
Well, that and all the fucking level cap quests suck.
But I got to say, you know, with all the changes they made to Final Fantasy XI, they've made a lot of changes for the better.
They've made items not so impossible to get in many ways.
The economy's eh.
I don't know.
I think the game's made a lot of improvements.
Classes have gotten changes that needed it.
And the new classes are pretty cool.
Dancer's pretty awesome and helps with small parties.
And Scholar's kind of cool, too.
You mean I don't have to compete with bots to get a frickin' pair of lizard boots anymore?
Well, they're Rare EX now, so it does them no good to camp Lizzie because the boots are Rare EX.
So if they get it, they can't sell it.
I would camp it and drop the boots just to piss people off.
That'd be awesome.
That's a lot of time, though.
You call me sad for clicking retry over and over.
You should play WoW.
They welcome people like you.
I don't have time to do that stuff.
I mean, come on.
Look at my gaming week.
I don't know.
Anyhow, the game itself, I need a little more time to explore the new areas, but I like some of the new music and some of the old areas I went into.
Are there any new areas?
Well, they're the old areas 20 years ago.
So there's different mobs and the, you know, it's not the exact same thing with different colors.
Like, for instance, one of the areas I traveled to in the past, Rollinberry Fields, you go to it in the past and you see, like, destruction.
Because it's supposed to be, like, 20 years ago when the war was going on, the Crystal War was going on.
You see destruction.
Like, there'll be holes in the path where it looks like cannonballs have struck the path and things like that.
So it's not, like, the exact same thing with different colors.
Can you go to the towns and stuff when they're like that, too?
You can't go to Juno, but apparently you can go to the other big three, Sandoria and
Yay, Caverns of Time!
Yes, but the Crystal War thing was written in the XI story long before WoW was out, so you can't say they did off WoW.
That's debatable.
Watch the intro movie sometime.
I know, but they've had that in since Warcraft 2.
Can't we have both?
Isn't there room for both?
Why has it always got to be WoW versus whatever?
There's room for both.
I'm playing both right now, and not much else.
That's because you're a double addict.
But I did play Rock Band.
I bought Rock Band.
I did not spend $170 on the Deluxe Bundle.
After our preview last week, I was like, you know, I just don't think I'm going to want to go through the setup of setting up the drums and everything this much.
As much as I love that guitar, I thought the guitar was a great controller, I'm kind of pissed off.
The companies can't play together.
You know how that guitar won't work with Guitar Hero?
It will.
There was some compatibility.
Only on PlayStation 3.
Only on PS3.
Well, that does me a fuck of a lot of good.
Actually, if I remember correctly, I think it was...
I want to say the Rock Band ones weren't working on Guitar Hero 3 or something like that.
All I know is that the Guitar Hero 2 controller works with both.
So I'm like, you know what?
I'll just continue to use that.
Even though my yellow button is starting to stick a little bit, I'll just use that.
Because the Rock Band songs aren't particularly hard.
Like, I notice I'm doing way better on hard level on Rock Band than I do on Guitar Hero.
But I think that's just because... I think...
It's a little bit better of a learning curve than Guitar Hero because in the hard difficulty on Rock Band, I noticed they add the fifth button, but they don't use it a lot, kind of like they do in Guitar Hero.
So you get some time to adjust to that.
I don't know.
Because your pinkies are weak.
Yeah, I haven't had as much problems adjusting to Rock Band at all.
But to be honest, I've only explored single player mode.
I have yet to make a band.
So I have yet to explore that mode.
So I can't really give a full review on the game, other than I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.
That's because you don't have any friends, because of how unlikable you are.
I want to be able to make a band for single player.
Like, I want to be able to make my bandmates, you know?
That's what I kind of... I was under the impression that's what you were going to be able to do, was to make your own, like, bands, and make your characters, and you can, like, play each one individually, and then have them all come together, but I guess not.
Because there would be no bass man.
So, yeah, because there's no base single player mode, which I was surprised to find out too.
So, I guess there's little places they can improve.
But I love the presentation of Rock Band.
I love the way it looks and how your characters get integrated into like the loading screens.
I think that's hilarious.
So, very cool.
Other than that, not a whole lot else I've been playing because of Thanksgiving and all.
And mine was great, thanks for asking.
Very small.
We did not have two turkeys like Loki's house did.
All right.
I thought I said at the end of last week's show we were going to be here after all, but maybe not, I don't know
I know we were kind of going back and forth, so we are here this week, but only for one part.
There will not be two parts to this week's show.
However, I do believe, in lieu of a Part B, I believe the Wii Zapper Challenge is happening tonight.
Yes.
Yes.
So we will be on Op 11 after the show, and of course this will be archived.
We will be doing the Wii Zapper Challenge where Loki has said that he does not need the Wii Zapper to do good in the game, so he's going to play with just the normal Wiimote.
I will be using the Wii Zapper, and whoever gets the higher score or what have you...
I don't know.
If I win, you have to take me out.
If you win, I have to take Nellie out.
But what if she won't go out with me?
I don't know.
Then I'll buy you guys dinner or something.
We'll make it a lot easier.
If I win, you get me a $20 gift card to some
I still haven't seen the MPD I actually have seen the MPD numbers come up for October but
I believe the eye judgment was just within that.
Although, in a few more weeks, we'll have the NPD numbers for November, and I'll let you guys know where eye judgment is standing as far as sales go.
On its way to a million in six months.
Yeah, right.
Sounds good.
All right, chat, who said you guys could come up with what the terms of the bet are?
Now, the chat is expressing some disappointment because they were looking forward to the Loki-Rob date.
We'll work something out.
I'll make them buy me dinner still.
Don't worry.
All right.
So stay tuned for that after the show tonight.
That's really all I got for housekeeping other than, you know, stay on top of our communities.
We love having more folks on our LiveJournal community at Orange Lounge on LiveJournal and our MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.
I always neglect to mention Facebook, but we do have a group on there, the OL Army, so just search for OLRMY, you'll find it, or Orange Lounge Radio, it'll come up as well.
Sorry, Facebook, but there's just so goddamn many apps on Facebook.
Like, every day I'm getting some freaking request for, like, so-and-so wants to play vampire with you and suck your blood.
I'm like...
Sorry.
Yeah, thanks, Drew.
All right, so there you have it.
Also, the Guitar Hero OL Army fell out of the top 100 this week, and that makes me a sad panda.
So we need more recruits for the Guitar Hero OL Army.
You can find us on GuitarHero.com.
You can just search for OL Army.
However, I will say that Richie Maniac still has the number one spot on my Xbox Live list.
He's on my list, and he's on the Guitar Hero All-Army, and he has like a million groupies.
Damn you and your achievement horrors.
I think he has 2,500 groupies, which is definitely the highest I've seen, so good job.
Alright, let's get into some gaming news then.
Who's going to start us off tonight?
Loki?
Yeah, I will start us off.
Anyways, as we kind of teased in the intro there...
The Romantics, a wonderful 80s band, I guess.
Yeah, I'm being sarcastic there.
They are suing over a cover version of their song What I Like About You that appeared in Guitar Hero Encore, Rocks the 80s.
Because apparently, the song sounds too much like them.
They want the game sales to be halted, and want...
Accounting of all profits from the game along with unspecified compensation and punitive damages.
So apparently their claim is that the song is virtually indistinguishable from the authentic version and therefore would confuse the consumer.
But, you know, I don't know.
It's like, I'm just thinking if it's virtually indistinguishable then what's it matter?
It's not like, you know, it sounds like crap and, you know, people are thinking that's the real song.
And after that, they're going to sue everyone who five stars on an expert.
You know, I would think that in the court of law, it's going to come down and the judge is going to say, can we just all agree that this song is so 20 years ago and you all need to get over it?
Or the fact that they probably paid to have the licensing of that song?
Because, I mean, I'm sure even though they didn't get the real artist to sing it,
They have, you know, the license, the rights to the song.
Do you think it's one of those cases where, like, the record company signed it over without them knowing?
Like, that type of thing?
Well, I'm not surprised there.
Exactly.
Didn't a similar thing happen in DDR?
Possibly.
Someone was saying, like, Strictly Business, but I don't see how that... That's a licensed song off of Dance Mania.
Well, the thing with Strictly Business is that the original artist of the song never consented to the song being in the game, and one of the artists went into an arcade one day and saw people playing the song...
and was like, what the hell is this?
We never said the song could be in the game.
But the record company did it.
You know, Rob, they didn't raise much of a fuss when it was in Karaoke Revolution Party.
Interesting.
But again, it wasn't a very good cover.
And plus, Karaoke Revolution doesn't quite have that pop culture recognizability that Guitar Hero does.
Let's actually listen.
Let's hear some clips.
Here's the original version of What I Like About You by The Romantics.
It's buffering.
It's a little slow.
Okay, that song's still kind of fun, I have to admit.
I bounce up and down.
Alright, let's listen to what the cover sounds like.
This is by The Wave Group, and you actually can get this on iTunes.
I'm just getting the clips actually right out of iTunes as well.
You know, I gotta say, it really does sound a lot similar.
No, it doesn't.
A little bit, a little bit.
Not even close.
Pursuing over that?
What a crock.
Well, let's see, let's see.
Now, keep in mind, there's other bands that cover this.
So, I just had a curiosity, just as like a, what do you call that, a control?
Like when you're doing a science experiment, you have to have a control?
So, let's actually take a look at a completely different cover.
So, from the band Kid Pop Rock and Roll Hits...
Rob, here's the hit crew with What I Like About You.
Oh shit, it's buffering.
Here we go.
Virtually undistinguishable.
I know, honestly, that's pretty similar too.
I thought Kidz Bop was reserved for cage match punishment.
Make the hurting stop.
I was not Kidz Bop, it was Kidz Pop.
Same damn thing.
Big difference.
No, big fucking difference.
That's a P, not a B, okay?
I would also like to point out, okay, I got one more for you guys.
This song was also covered on an album called The Barbie Hit Mix.
See, that's Barbie singing.
Okay, I have one question.
How effective is this mic as a bludgeoning instrument of death?
Honestly, the guitars and everything sound very similar.
Why does Barbie look like one of the Olsen twins?
That's what I'm wondering, too.
I'm looking at the cover of this going, wow, Barbie got really slutty.
So there you have it.
Got really slutty?
Nim in chat says, Barbie is made of plastic, no mouth.
How does she talk?
Same the way Britney Spears does.
You know, given the same circumstances.
I'll give you a hint, kids.
It's the devil.
So there you have it.
They're being sued.
What do you think?
Drew, what do you think?
Is there any weight to this lawsuit?
Do you think the romantics have a claim here or what?
No.
No, it is not even remotely similar.
It's similar as me singing this song, okay?
I mean, seriously.
Oh, oh, would you?
No, I won't.
Sorry, Rob.
You will.
No, it's just, it's stupid.
It's stupid.
I say yes, it's similar, but at the same time, somebody who had the rights to this song agreed to let the song in the game.
Now, if it came out that the developers got no permission to use this song whatsoever, then I would say they have a case.
Seeing as I'm pretty sure they got the rights somewhere, whether that be they went directly to the record label and never approached the band, well, then the band should take that up with the record label.
Why are you signing our stuff over to video games that are going to remake our songs too similarly?
Or why didn't you just let them use the original version for more money or what have you?
I think if the song was licensed, then go QQ some more, Romantics.
Or perhaps the band should have a more unique voice that can't be copied so easily.
What the fuck is wrong with them?
DMN Nourishment says in chat, bottom line, sue the record company for signing and not Activision.
Stop fucking whining.
Nim says, there's a difference between similar and same.
If it's a cover, then it's different, and they are going to be made a fool of.
Escapist says, I want to see Loki pop advertised on late night TV.
And Radink360 says, Loki should sing it in the Tingle costume.
There you have it.
Lots of love for Loki singing.
I think you could put out an album that would be bigger than Shatner.
I don't want to do that.
Well, not that I could tell you where you can find clips on the internet of Loki singing, but I'll give you a hint.
Rock Band is the topic of our next story.
And we did something with Rock Band very recently.
Anyhow, Rock Band has opened up a store.
That's right.
There's a new store with accessories.
There's a whole drum bag you can actually buy on this store.
It's a $50 bag.
to basically keep that whole drum set in.
I want that.
It is kind of nice, but it's $50.
I don't care.
I want that.
Is it worth $50, though?
It is worth $50.
You know why, though?
Because have you ever tried buying a bag for consoles?
Trust me, I have numerous times.
Those fucking backpacks that they have for the Xbox 360 are like $70.
It's fucking ridiculous.
That looks nice.
Yeah, I gotta admit, it does look kinda nice, but I don't know, I mean, like, god, you already spent $170 on the game, do you really need to spend $50 more?
Well, they have, like, you can buy actual guitars on that website and shit, like... Yeah, I know, there's other members... It's like, I just bought $169 worth of fake instruments, let's buy some real ones too, yay!
By the way, before we get to the next story, speaking of Guitar Hero, I'm a little...
A little more Guitar Hero, a little less Rock Band.
Did you see that thing?
And Tiger Claw was sharing this with our forum people, and he was asking me about this before the show.
Did you see that whole Guitar Hero in the blender thing?
I love that website.
They put that on the Will It Blend.
That is the question.
And they actually put the controller in the blender.
Well, half of it.
I don't mean to post spoilers, but yes.
Everything blends, except for Norris.
I love that website now.
You should check that out.
I giggled my head off watching that.
Rob, I like how Loki used the appropriate verb.
He didn't laugh, he giggled when he watched Will It Blend.
Rob?
Yes.
They did put Chuck Norris in the blender on that segment.
What, like a cardboard cutout or something?
Action figure.
Everything blends, except Chuck Norris.
I apologize to all listeners for bringing up Chuck, but it had to be done.
I'm telling you, those people that are behind the marketing of that blender...
are fucking geniuses.
It is absolutely the best thing.
And that's the entry-level blender.
You can get one that's more powerful than that.
You can dispose bodies in that thing.
Loki, it's $250.
No one's buying it.
I thought it was like $600.
I thought it was $600.
It used to be $600.
It could be a restaurant-caliber thing.
No, it used to be $600.
Now it's $399.
Just like the PS3.
But it can be yours for four low payments of $99.99.
Four low payments.
Just like the PS3 or the iPhone.
Yeah.
Nim in chat, chat.orangelandre.com if you're listening to us live on this Sunday evening says, Chuck Norris doesn't blend.
Chuck Norris blends blenders.
Let's not start this.
I'm sorry.
Yes, please let's not.
Let's move on to the next story quickly.
Anyways, speaking of blending, someone I'd love to throw into that wonderful high-powered blender.
Senator Hillary Clinton and of course some other folks.
The views and opinions expressed by Loki do not necessarily reflect those of the station or other staff members of Orange Lingerie.
But they are the majority of the studio.
Anyways, Senator Hillary Clinton, Joe Lieberman, Sam Brownback, and even Bay, I guess, have sent letters to the ESRB asking for a thorough review of Manhunt 2 following the whole unlock
uh, content, do the hacking the game.
Uh, apparently they think because they're like political types that the ESRB would go, okie dokie, we didn't do our job the first time or something.
Um, and actually, the other thing that they're also wanting, um, done is because they're a little bit pissed off with the whole Wii controls and how you can murder people using the Wii remote, they want the Wii games to be rated differently because of such things like that.
So they want that taken into consideration for future ratings.
Because you know you can still aim a gun with a mouse.
Escapist in chat says, Sweet Jesus, is Manhunt 2 even selling that well?
My thoughts exactly.
No, I can tell you right now it's not.
Honestly, I don't understand the point of it.
I mean, doesn't fucking Hillary Clinton have better things to do?
No.
Seriously.
Well, I heard she's running for president.
I hope she wins!
I know, doesn't she have better things to do?
I really hope she wins.
Well, if I remember right, though, it's not just her, but she did band together with these other folks.
It's a multi-partisan thing.
Oh, well, it's four people then.
And I think this goes back to the fact that politicians generally are a little bit ignorant about this stuff.
See, this is what I don't understand is, you know, four letters from politicians and they want results, yet, you know, if I send them four letters to shut the fuck up, they're not going to do it either, so...
Why should they listen to them?
Well, maybe someone the ESRB should listen to is Mr. T!
Because goddammit, everybody should listen to Mr. T. And if that is true, then everybody will soon own a copy of World of Warcraft because there are brand new commercials featuring Mr. T and William Shatner for World of Warcraft.
And they're pretty... They're very interesting because, yeah, in the commercial, and I'm not going to play it because Blizzard isn't paying us to play it, but...
In the commercial, Mr. T talks about how he fantasizes himself as a night elf mohawk, even though there isn't actually a mohawk in the game.
And William Shatner is a shaman, a torn shaman.
Go figure, he's been nerfed to hell.
Apparently, Mini-Me has filmed a commercial as well.
You know, Vern Troyer has also filmed one.
I hope to God he's a gnome.
You better believe he's a gnome.
That's all I have to say.
I hope to God he's a gnome.
No, I think they're going to do the ironic thing where he's going to play a very tall character.
Make him a dry.
Lame.
I already got Shatner as a tauren.
Let's see here.
On a completely different note, Warcraft may be taking...
Warhawk Operation Omega Dawn
And there's going to be some nighttime base battles as well.
Few cliched titles.
Well, it's nice to see that they're expanding their games.
What few they have.
More power to them.
I agree.
There's a lot of dumb titles out there in video gaming, so titles aren't everything.
It's the gameplay that's going to be important in this expansion.
Of course, I never played the first Warhawk, so...
What?
What?
What did they say in chat room?
They're already subverting it.
Who?
They're already subverting the call name.
Who and what?
Chat room.
Who specifically and what?
We have Nim calling it Omega Dump, Sashiel Omega Dumb, Omega Dong, Omega Gong.
How mature.
Omega Penis.
Whoa, did we just make our first penis joke?
Probably not the last.
Speaking of jokes, the PlayStation 3 version of the Orange Box may be pretty hilarious.
Apparently... Thank you, Drew, for that very scary maniacal laughter.
What the hell was that?
That was my evil laugh.
That apparently was the evil... Wow.
That was the evil, I am laughing at you, PS3.
I'm a little scared about this.
Anyhow...
The Orange Box is actually, it's not being ported by Valve, who were doing the PC and 360 versions.
Apparently another team at EA has taken upon it to actually port this game over to the PlayStation 3.
And the early reports are saying...
Not that great.
Were they the team behind Superman Returns?
Oh God, I hope not.
Apparently there are a number of frame rate hiccups and other technical issues which, quote, at best merely hinder gameplay and at worst make the experience downright unplayable.
You know, what's interesting is if you think about other things you might have read about, Gabe Newell, who's one of the co-founders of Valve, he's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The Orange Box is a pretty awesome game, going off what I've heard.
But Loki certainly said a lot of great things about Orange Box.
DarkSakura loves her some Portal.
She's gone freaking crazy with Portal.
I will be playing Orange Box this week, though, because Loki's Lomi is copy, so I'll let you know next week.
But whenever great games get disgraced like that, it makes us a little bit angsty.
And when we get angsty, the FU music comes in and we do our rants.
I'd actually like to start tonight because I'm reading chat.
I'm going to give an F you to Nim, who said, Omega, two girls, one cup.
Seriously.
Let it go.
Seriously, let it go on both ends of that.
I don't really have anything else to really say F you to, so I guess you get that.
F you to sleeping until one today.
That was pretty awesome.
Loki.
F you to being sick.
Stuffed up and all the other fun stuff that goes along with it.
F.U.
to Loki's SARS?
I hope it's not contagious.
FU to people in Battlefield 2 who insist I fly a helicopter even though I have no idea how to fly a helicopter FU to not having all these wonderful PC games that are coming out lately and FU to not being able to feed my WoW addiction Well you just need to have Tank upload a program for you to learn how to fly a combat helicopter Ooh, points for the Matrix reference Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the FUs of the week
Incredibly nerdy, thanks to Drew being here.
You know what's funny?
We're having that guy, Joe Pantalone, I think, coming in.
The guy that played Cypher.
He's coming into our work.
Oh, that guy.
He's that guy.
You don't really know his name, but in every mob movie, he plays a mob guy.
Or he plays... Or he... No.
I don't know what happened.
He was in... What was that movie?
Memento.
Yes, he was in Memento.
And Sopranos, and oddly enough, The Princess Diaries.
I don't wanna watch this again!
I still vote for the steak dinner.
So, yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What?
Is that the actual company?
Okay, I'm sorry, but this is the actual company.
Developed by Champagne for the Ladies is the name.
Loki, this sounds right up your alley.
Champagne for the Ladies?
What kind of a fucking development team is that?
This sounds like the candy that strangers use to get people in their cars.
I mean, oh, but it gets better.
I got champagne for the ladies.
It replaces all the boyish drug running and random violence with stuff girls like.
Like experimenting with drugs.
Using sex... What?
Using sexuality for personal gain.
And clawing to the top of the social order by any means necessary.
Shut the fuck up.
Where is this from?
Is this for real?
Yeah, it's, um... You can gossip, shoplift... Shoplifting.
Uh...
Game, you know, all sorts of things like that.
Anyways, apparently, this being chat says, Grand Theft Auto, Ho Island.
Now that's degrading.
That's degrading.
Apparently, there's a report, though, on Canada.com.
Yes, they're so cool, they have their own .com.
They're writing that while the Australian Family Association deems the game toxic,
and Christine Devitt of the Montreal's Concordia University calls it corrosive.
That's not really a description for a game.
Insert blame Canada judge here.
That is the actual development name for the company.
The folks at Champagne for the Ladies say it's all in good fun.
First off, I'm sorry, but no one's going to take a company named Champagne for the Ladies seriously.
GS191 has an interesting point.
It's the Winona Riders Simulator.
This is more of like a Britney Spears simulator.
Drugs ruin your life and all that stuff.
My God.
But, like, I don't know.
Tell me if it's just me, but isn't there, like, a sick side of you that, like, kind of wants to play it?
I'll set it done.
Like, I'm kind of like... You know, it's like one of those things, like, I have to play it, like, before I die.
Hey, you know what?
Take two.
Pay attention to what they're doing in this game.
That way you can add a female character into Grand Theft Auto that you can play.
And there you go.
That's what women like.
Women like using sexuality for personal gain.
Pulling each other's hair.
And doing all stuff like that.
When Jamie's not here.
This is what happens.
Frisbee asks, what would Jamie's comments on this be?
I don't have a clue.
If we get her on the phone later, we'll have to watch.
I really don't know.
She would probably be making some sort of noise similar to this.
That's, I think, what Jamie would do.
Call me crazy.
Anyhow, let's get back into some real games.
Such as a real gamer girl, Lara Croft.
And I say that because Lara Croft has big boobs.
No, just kidding.
But of course, Lara Croft is much more of a hero than any of the characters in that other game ever will be.
has come out with Tomb Raider Anniversary on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
It's actually available for 1,200 Microsoft points.
That's going to set you back about 15 bucks.
Here's the thing, though.
You need to own Tomb Raider Legend in order to play it because it's technically downloadable content for that.
But if you want to download the Tomb Raider Anniversary, check that out.
It's available on the Xbox 360 right now.
Actually, I think that's only the first half of the game.
I think it's going to be two halves.
They're about 1,200 points each.
Ah.
Well, then there you have it.
But, uh,
If you don't like that, you can spend an extra $10 and buy the disc.
So, what's Lara Croft's equivalent of Horse Armor?
Or better yet, just wait a few months because this game isn't that great to begin with and wait for the drop in price.
Does download content drop in price that much?
I guess so.
I bought Carcassonne and it was free like four months later.
I'm talking about buying the disc version of the game.
Oh, I gotcha.
Speaking of Xbox Live stuff...
If you live in Europe, they're going to be offering you, instead of Halo 3 for buying an Xbox 360, 10 free Xbox Live Arcade games for new European Xbox 360 owners and a friend.
Let's see here.
Now, what you can do... Let's see.
If you buy a console between October 1st and December 14th, you fill out a form and then both you and a friend can get 10 free Xbox Live Arcade games.
And which...
To be honest, aren't that bad.
It's a pretty good selection, including Every Extent Extra Extreme, Sonic the Hedgehog, Street Fighter 2, Hyper Fighting, Bomberman Live, Marble Blast Ultra, Spyglass Board Games, Small Arms, 3D Ultra Mini Golf Adventures, Assault Heroes, and Zuma Deluxe.
But hey, it's free.
It's not bad.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Also, let's get into some release dates and talk about Europe first.
Jamie's not here, but I've got you covered on what is coming out in Europe.
And I imagine now that the holidays are over, things are slowing down in terms of release dates, but apparently not.
There's still a lot of stuff coming out on the 30th over in Europe.
We have a port of Alvin and the Chipmunks, which is that, I'm sure, a translation of that, I'm sure, Oscar award-winning movie.
It's a music game.
Is it a music game for real?
It's not karaoke, though, but it's a rhythm music game.
Yeah, but... You know, there's rhythm music games that are good, like DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero.
Then there's these types of music games.
This isn't going to be one of them.
Yeah, exactly.
Alvin and Chipmunks comes out on the 30th on the DS and the Wii.
BlackSci Area 51 makes its way to the PC and the Xbox 360, also on the 30th.
Boogie finally makes its way to Europe on PlayStation 2 and the DS this week.
Cruisin' comes out on the Wii.
I'm sure you can skip that.
Football Manager for the PSP comes out as well as Guitar Hero 3 comes out on the PC this week.
I believe it already came out on the consoles last week because I've seen, yeah, it must have come out last week because I saw some British folks joining the OL Army.
Jenga comes out on the DS on the 30th.
Medal of Honor for the PSP also comes out on the 30th.
Pro Evo Soccer 2008 for the PSP also on the 30th.
Puzzle Quest comes out on the PlayStation 2.
Resident Evil The Umbrella Chronicles on the Wii.
Speedball 2 on the PC.
Syphon Filter on the PSP.
The Golden Compass on damn near every system.
Again, another kind of gaming port of a movie.
And lastly, but certainly not leastly, My Horse and Me on the PC.
Developed by Atari.
And you wonder why their CEO recently left the company.
Oh my god, and it's fucking full-priced?
We just stole $34 out of your wallet.
It's magic!
Well, if you're buying it from GameStop, it's full-priced, but it's supposed to be $20.
Two words.
Ping pals.
Cranium Kabuki, if you like that trivia game, normally a board game, you can buy that from Ubisoft on the Wii.
Boogie is coming out in the DS this week.
Also, Geometry Wars Galaxies on the DS.
History Channel Battle for the Pacific on the Wii.
And let's see.
And Indoor Sports from Konami, although that's not coming out.
That's next year.
Well, they list it as because we have some more current dates than they do.
That's it.
It's really... I imagine it's probably a much slower week here, thanks to Black Friday being over.
Did anybody actually venture out on Black Friday?
I did, like, later on in the evening.
I went to GameStop around 2 to pick up the Wings of the Goddess, and it wasn't that bad.
They were adequately staffed, I'll tell you that.
They had, like, people walking the floor and everything.
I went and bought Zola and the Zapper.
You know what's weird, though?
Hmm?
The Zapper, from what we've, you know, the press release said it was supposed to be $20.
And, you know, my company, we're selling it at $20 retail.
GameStop's selling it for $25.
Oh, ho, ho.
Everywhere.
Interesting.
Shop around for the best deal?
No, I spent $25 because I'm lazy.
I don't know, it's wasted $25 right there.
But, you know, we'll get into that later.
Alright, let's get into some Japanese release dates.
Assassin's Creed comes out in Japan, the localized version for the Xbox 360 from Ubisoft.
Apocalypse Desire Next is a new game on the Xbox 360.
It is a strategy-based game, and it doesn't look like anything we have over here.
Just trying to take a look at some screenshots real quick.
Looks like it might be a tactical type of game.
Trying to look here.
Oh yeah, it's definitely more of a tactical-based type of game, so check that out.
If you like those games, Apocalypse Desire next.
Also coming out this week in Japan on the Wii, Swing Golf!
Panjia Second Shot is coming out, which I'm sure is just kind of Nintendo's version of Hot Shots Golf, or who are we trying to kid?
It's just another rip-off of a Wii sports title.
Also coming out on the Wii, Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes on the Wii, coming out from Capcom.
Also coming out in Japan, Tony Hawk's Project 8 on the PlayStation 3.
Star Train, Your Past Makes Your Future on the PlayStation 2 from Princess Soft.
And you can get a limited edition of that game as well if you follow every Princess Soft title.
Speaking of princesses on the Nintendo DS, Disney Princesses Magical Jewels comes out in Japan.
I don't know exactly what their magical jewels are, but I don't want to find out.
Cats 2 comes out of the Nintendo DS in Japan.
Another cat simulation game.
Because apparently Cats 1 with a Z, that's Cats with a Z, was so popular there is now a Cats 2.
Fukumori, Mori No Unhappy Project is coming out from Bandai, also on the Nintendo DS.
And I have no idea what this game's all about.
Looks like it could be another mix of minigames.
It's hard to tell from the screenshots.
It's an action-based game.
Probably a typical platformer.
What's so damn funny?
Is it chat?
It's chat.
What are they saying in chat, Drew?
Oh, typical DMN.
Princess off.
Doesn't Rob work for them?
Ha ha ha, funny.
Coming out on the PSP, Disgaea Hour of Darkness Portable.
Coming out, the portable version of the popular strategy game.
That's going to do it for Japanese release dates.
Awesome.
Anyways, one thing that's supposedly coming soon to the Wii, which is weird because I never thought it would, but the Unreal 3 engine is apparently being adapted for the Wii by some unnamed company.
They're porting it over much like I guess they did with the Unreal 2 engine.
Oh, Ubisoft ported over the Unreal 2 engine for Red Steel.
Hmm.
So is it coming over for Red Steel 2, maybe?
Uh, I don't know.
Because isn't the rumor that that game is supposed to be being made?
It is.
Hopefully it doesn't suck as much as the first one.
Yeah, maybe they can make it right this time.
Hmm.
I don't know.
You know, you've heard my opinion on Ubisoft ports for Wii.
Uh...
I try to stay away from them.
But we don't know for sure it's them.
It's an unnamed company that's doing it, but it's just kind of one of those, you know, if you were betting, odds would favor this.
You know, I think they could probably do it if they, you know, did something like Cell Shaded or something like that.
Very simple, like, you know, Wind Waker type graphics.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Then they can sell that to other companies, you know, to make Wii versions of stuff using the Unreal 3 engine.
And plus, you know, with just the Wii selling as crazy as it is, you know, if you've probably seen the stories on Black Friday, people are still going crazy about the Nintendo Wii.
And it's, you know, it's kind of a different demographic.
You know, the more family household, quote unquote, is where the Nintendo Wiis are going.
So certainly if there is a particular game that they want to try and get a piece of that audience with that type of, you know, share the marketplace, they'll go for it.
Anyhow, let's take this opportunity to dive into the mailbag and take a look at some of the emails that we've gotten this week.
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
DarkSakura will usually take on these responsibilities, but since she's not here, I stole the password to the mailbag and I'm looking in her place.
Let's look at email number one tonight.
Four emails we're reading tonight.
Email number one comes to us from
Arvid, who didn't use a handle, so I called him by his real name.
Arvid said, Greetings!
Just a quick question.
What is the song called that you play at the end of the show, and from what game is it?
Sorry if this has already been answered in the forums.
The song at the end of the program that you will hear in a little while when we finish.
That's iFutureList by Akira Yamaoka, which I believe appeared in DDR...
Supernova in the US for a console game.
I thought it was Extreme 2 also.
Was it in Extreme 2?
I thought it was Supernova.
And I'm sure one of the Bombani nerds in chat knows for sure, but it made its first appearance in one of the 2DX games.
I want to say 2DX 13th?
I don't remember.
I stopped tracking after 8th.
It shows up in various Bombani games.
Let's go to the next email coming to us from Charred.
Also known as Rick, the UK fanboy.
Hey guys, do you have a postage address?
We're going through a mass tidy at our house and I have to throw out a lot of my stuff.
I've come across some things that might be fun to send you.
A Christmas present maybe.
Oh, maybe I'll... I like presents.
I like presents.
As long as it's not a B-O-M-B, then I guess I'm okay with giving out the address.
So we'll see.
Uh, yeah, sure, I'll reply to that and find out, but there's another part of this.
I wouldn't have read this on air if that was it.
There is another part of this.
Anyway, I also have a question.
Which game were you so excited to get, and when it came out was the biggest disappointment?
If you could go back in time and hit the developer over the head with a big comedy inflatable hammer, what would you get them to change?
Cheerio, Govna, Chimney, Cup of Tea, Telly, and all that stuff.
Well, he is our UK fanboy, so... You forgot Crumpets!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Guilty Gear Dust Strikers DS Game
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But they screwed up the fighting system, they screwed up the plot, and they made a joke of a last boss.
Easy, easy, easy for me.
The game that was the biggest disappointment where I wanted to go back and smack the developers upside the head, Nintendogs.
Remember E3?
I freaking fell in love with this game.
I said it's going to be the greatest game that comes out this year, and then when the game comes out, I was bored with it in an hour.
Woof.
I know, because there was nothing really else to do besides those three contests.
There wasn't a lot of competitive stuff, and there wasn't much you could do with the dogs.
Yes, I realized it was supposed to be a sim, but I don't know.
I was thinking there would be more of a game to it, and there wasn't, and that was kind of sad.
How about We Connect 24?
Does that count as a game?
Kind of.
Animal Crossing DS would be a close second for me, honestly.
I was expecting so much more from that, and I think it felt more like a port than a sequel, and that was what was ultimately disappointing.
So there you have it.
Yeah, and the other disappointing thing about Nintendogs is the fact that it's been selling like crazy, and now we have all of these knockoff games to thank, such as like Cats 2, which I think we said earlier, Imagine Babies, all those stuff.
Did you see they had, what was it, a bundle, I think, through, I want to see maybe, it was like one of the big retail chains.
But it was the Nintendogs, like that metallic red or rose DS.
And then two or three other versions of Nintendogs.
You get like four of the same game.
Nice.
Very nice.
DMNourishment said it was designed to be played like 15 minutes a day, Rob.
What do you want?
Yeah, and then it got boring after two days.
I mean, that was the problem.
There was not a lot to come back for.
There wasn't a lot to kind of like earn or work towards in that game.
It's a freaking Tamagotchi.
Kind of.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't see how this is actually related to games, but that's how it is spun.
If you ask me, the violent act was done solely for money.
The fact that it was for four pounds sterling doesn't make it more tragic because the kid didn't know how much she had.
So in other words, he's sending us a link to the story about how, you know, let's see, boy murders old woman for game money.
Oh, and this is a story that was dug and everything.
It was a 13-year-old kid in Vietnam robbed an 81-year-old woman, and he used the money to play online games.
I see.
And obviously where Rob's kind of going is that, isn't this really about a robbery?
Why does it necessarily have to be about games?
Who cares what they spent it on?
It wasn't me, I swear.
I mean, but if he spent it on crack, it wouldn't have made the news.
You know, it's sad that that woman got robbed, but we really want to know, what did he spend the money on?
Let's get in the mind of this criminal.
How did he spend that money?
And then let's prove that gamers are completely worthless moral rejects.
I love this, too, is that the story makes reference to the story from earlier this month when that kid beat up his mom over Halo 3 when she tried to take it away from him, like call the cops, that whole thing we read on a previous show.
They remind folks of that.
Yeah, let's just call it bad parenting and leave it at that.
That's your Jamie angle, I imagine.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
My PS3 is being borrowed by a friend who likes Ratchet & Clank a lot more than I do.
Nice.
And he's playing it, and he loves the game.
So that's a no, but... To be honest, I don't even think I want to play the game.
It looks fun.
It looks like Ratchet & Clank.
Why'd you buy it?
Because I was too lazy to cancel my pre-order.
I just said, fuck it, I'm going to pick it up because it's supposed to be a good game.
You tool.
It looks good.
It looks fun, but no, it's just...
I didn't play any of the Ratchet & Clank games, and there's probably a reason for that.
It's because I didn't want to play them.
And why the fuck did I buy the new one?
I know, because I'm desperate for good games for the PS3.
And which you don't play.
Well, now I'm loaning it to a friend right now, because he's going to get his own PS3 soon, and probably when he does that, I'm probably going to sell him the game, so... Ranma says, Damn, Loki, you're sad.
Dartitsuya says, Loki, do you think Mario Galaxy ripped them off, as they claim?
No.
Alright.
More of the email from Marissimo here.
Also, have you guys tried Super Stardust HD or any other PSN titles?
I think that even though the selection is pretty slim, most of the games are worth trying, especially if you've got a Japanese account.
GT Prologue looks fucking amazing.
Thanks for consistently putting on such great shows.
We appreciate it.
Thank you.
I do have a Japanese account, and I do play GT Prologue, and I still don't like Gran Turismo, no matter how pretty they make it, but that's just my personal preference.
It looks pretty.
I wouldn't say it's any better than Project Gotham Racing 3.
I don't know.
When you get the cars looking that good, it's not like leaps and bounds better than anything that's out there right now.
I do have Flow.
Flow's fun.
Personally, the only thing that's really stopping me from buying games on the PlayStation Network is I hate their fucking account system where you have to put money on this account and then
Yeah, but even with Xbox Live Marketplace, you get a little bit of that, where you always have some points left over, you know?
Yeah, but at least there's stuff I can download on there.
I mean, and also a lot of the download stuff that they have on the PlayStation Network is a little bit more expensive.
or like less production value or whatever.
I know there's good stuff on there like Everyday Shooter and some of the stuff like that.
But there's nothing really that's jumped out at me other than Flow.
Flow is kind of fun.
But I don't know.
All right.
All right.
Well, that's it for the mailbag.
So again, if you want to email us sometime, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
All right.
Anyways, on to some other stuff.
Of course, it's no surprise that Super Mario Galaxy is selling well.
It has sold 500,000 copies in the U.S.
in the first week alone, which is pretty awesome.
And of course, it's probably going to be continuing to sell well all throughout the holidays.
We also know that it sold 250,000 units in Japan in its first week as well, so.
HALO 3 HALO 3
Teetered off, like, really quick, I think.
Well, I mean, it had a huge launch.
And, you know, everybody that had Halo 2.
It's kind of like, earlier in the show, I was talking about the whole MMO thing.
I mean, in a way, it's kind of similar with fans, you know, hardcore fans of a series.
Everybody's going to be out there day one buying it.
Can you imagine if Halo 3's multiplayer servers had gone down going, oh, sorry, we didn't think so many people would try to get on.
Which is basically what, you know, Squeenix did with Final Fantasy.
Well, the difference is there's a single player element to Halo.
I guess that's true.
Alright, well, anyhow.
Oh, you can play single player in Final Fantasy XI.
That's funny.
There's a new device out there called the Cyber Famulator.
It allows you to play your Famicom games on your DS Lite.
Also with this device, you can use a TV Out.
Now, keep in mind that is a Famicom emulator.
It's not actually an emulator.
It's an actual device.
You put your DS on top of it and it does this whole thing.
So keep in mind it's Japanese, so you can't use it for NES games.
But just out of curiosity, is this something you guys would want?
Would you want it like it is now to play Japanese imports?
Or do you think it might be kind of cool to have something to use your old school NES cartridges on?
It looks kind of cool.
It looks like almost the DS version of the Super 8.
I'd get it just for nostalgia's sake.
I wish there was more you could do with it, kind of like with the Super Game Boy and stuff.
Like you could change the colors and all that dumb shit.
It would be cool if you could like, I don't know,
DMN Fuck Your Warranty FYI
That's a good point, if you're going to get something like this, and then some people still have warranties.
Why would it fuck your warranty?
I think it's something you have to attach there with... No, it just plugs into the Game Boy Advance slot.
Yeah.
That's why it's only on one screen, because it's plugging into the Game Boy Advance slot.
You probably could fucking use it on a Game Boy Advance.
Hmm.
But, you know... Oh, it's for the DS, I'm sorry.
Interesting.
But yeah, it's not like something you have to mod your system for, that'd be stupid.
Alright.
But anyways.
Anyways, let's see here.
There's actually been a series that just started on TV, and I gotta mention this.
The Discovery Channel's Rise of the Video Game.
It's actually pretty good.
I watched the first episode of it.
It reminds me if you've ever watched G4's Icon series that they have.
Very similar to that kind of thing, but it's, you know, kind of the whole history of video games.
And they just started with, like, you know, the very first computer game to, you know, the 70s, like Pac-Man and
and stuff like that.
Yeah, exactly.
And a really fascinating series.
I mean, they're going to replay the hell out of this all throughout the week, so I recommend catching it on TV or YouTube.
DMM would like to remind you that any third-party thingamajig not licensed fucks your warranty, apparently.
You mean I avoided my warranty by using a game gene in my NES?
How would they prove that you fucked it up by plugging it in there?
If there's no physical evidence, they're not going to be like...
Hmm, I sense residue from this thing.
I mean, they're not fucking CSI.
There's a lot of dust on this.
If you go, my DS broke, you know, fix it.
They're just going to do it.
They're not going to be able to tell unless you actually broke it open.
You'll never know.
They're not CSI.
They don't have the snappy one-liners.
All right.
Let's go...
Wait, I actually want to ask real quick about the rise of the video game.
Is that something you actually watched?
Yeah, I did.
It was good.
What was the format of it?
Because I forgot to TiVo it.
It's basically a reminder, like I said, of the Icon series.
They kind of discuss different things that went on, and then they would have developers and major key figures and stuff commenting on it.
They had the president of IGN, they had some of the...
The creator of Pac-Man and stuff And they were talking about all the phenomenon, the pop culture stuff Related with video games And just the mentality and all that stuff They went and talked about Tetris It's just very well done It's a really cool series I think it's worth checking out The last documentary I watched on games was that PBS one That was in high def, it was kind of neat
I mean, this, like I said, I love the Icon series.
That was probably my favorite show on G4, but, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Alright, this week's classic game of the week is a game called Equinox.
It's the classic game of the week.
Equinox was actually the sequel to another game on the NES called Solstice 2.
I don't know, I'm sorry, Solstice was the game on NES.
This was kind of Solstice 2 in many ways.
And part of the reason I like totally dig this game is the fact that it was kind of like...
I love the ambience and the music in this game.
It really set the mood.
Basically, you have this isometric view of the game.
If you haven't played Solstice on the NES, it was very similar.
You had this isometric view of the game.
You were going through these dungeons and trying to solve all these different puzzles in the game.
The ambience that the music set was just, like, awesome.
And you got these different items, and you had to fight the bosses, and it had, like, really cool boss music in the game.
And I think, ironically, one of the things that was really cool about Equinox was that it was actually developed by Sony.
One of the Sony spin-offs companies, Sony ImagineSoft, was actually the company that made this game.
So it was kind of like Sony making a game for the Super Nintendo.
Equinox
It required a hell of a lot of patience.
It had kind of a steep learning curve, but it was a little fun once you got used to it.
It did.
It had a real steep learning curve to it, and it was fucking hard.
The other thing about it is that it had a really precise way to kind of get through the game, and it was not very forgiving in regards to running into people and stuff.
You pop up on the overworld.
I don't know if it's maybe the YouTube guy playing it on an emulator or something, but why the fuck is all the text in front of... Because it's a demo.
You're looking at a demo.
Oh.
So...
You pop up on the overworld and within two minutes you're dead.
Yeah, it's tough.
It's tough.
Yeah, there were little bosses around the overworld.
You know this game was actually originally developed to be an RPG.
If you actually look on YouTube, you can find YouTube clips of this game as like an RPG.
You can actually see like text that was cut from the game.
So, kind of interesting the way it's set up.
So there you have it.
And being asked in chat room, DMN under the guys, your mom, says, Rob, will this be on virtual console?
And I say, Lordy, I hope so.
I hope so.
So, Loki, you'll be bringing in a classic game next week in Jamie's absence, correct?
Yeah.
All right.
All right, well, this is the part of the show then.
It is a short show tonight.
We want to cram it all into one segment, so we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype lines.
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
And folks have been hammering the phones already.
I believe we already have a call on the line.
Caller, are you there?
Hi, Rob.
Hi.
Is this Jamie?
Yes, it is.
Hi, Jamie.
How are you?
I'm looking at the rain right now.
Is it raining where you're at?
Oh yeah, it's raining.
Of course.
So I'm sure... I am... I'm sorry, I know you're... Oh, go ahead.
I was just saying, I'm calling from Alabama.
Well, how has things been going out there?
How was your Thanksgiving?
We had it yesterday, and Mom cooked for a small army, but thankfully a small army showed up, and then they went off to kick butt for me.
Nice.
And it was pretty cool, and...
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, that movie's cool.
Hypercube and Cube Zero, which I'm supposed to be watching while I'm here.
and DarkSakura.com.
Not much else, you know.
I almost logged into Ragnarok once at this Wi-Fi place that we found.
Very cool.
To check my vending.
And I didn't.
I resisted the urge.
If I sounded a little distracted during the Classic Game of the Week segment, that's because I was actually trying to pick up Jamie's call.
But I was curious, did you hear the Classic Game of the Week segment?
Did I pick a worthy game this week?
Did you say you picked Psychonauts?
No, it was Equinox, which was Solstice 2 on the Super Nintendo, basically.
I was like, that wasn't on Super Nintendo.
No, no, Equinox.
Huh?
Equinox, which was much, well, I like Psychonauts 2.
I can't say it's much cooler, but it was a very cool game, so.
Yeah.
I was just curious if I picked a worthy game this week.
I'd say you did.
That's a pretty good one.
Awesome.
You gave my stamp of approval.
Good, good.
I'm always looking for that.
Loki, tell Jamie a little bit about the story we covered earlier in the evening.
There's apparently a girl Grand Theft Auto type of game coming out.
And Loki, what is it you can do in this game?
You can do drugs.
You can also have sex with people for your own personal gain.
Spread Rumors, stuff like that.
Does this sound like the female Grand Theft Auto to you?
Doing drugs and pulling people's hair?
Um, no.
See, my perfect version would be like this hardcore chick with like an... We actually just got done watching Planet Terror, so it would be Rose McGowan.
Oh, and it's developed by a company called Champagne for the Ladies.
That's so stupid.
What about... Wait, who would be cooler, Rose McGowan or Tank Girl?
Oh, that's a hard one.
That's a hard, hard one.
I don't know, Tank Girl's pretty hardcore, but she has to have the tank.
That's true.
I think they should just make a Tank Girl video game, honestly.
That would be great.
They were going to, and it got cancelled.
Don't!
Of course, Stuart has to do all the artwork.
On the original PlayStation.
Ah.
I've already been challenged by a Wii Zapper.
It fell on my foot before I left.
We're actually watching Eddie Izzard right now.
Well, then go enjoy the Eddie Izzard.
Alright, take care.
Bye everybody.
Bye.
We'll see you when we get back in two weeks.
Bye-bye.
Jamie was very patient waiting on hold while I was doing the classic game of the week, so I appreciate that.
Alright, let's go to the phones again.
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you can call or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Raven Stolfen.
Hello, Raven Stolfen.
How are you?
I am okay.
A little cramped in here.
A little cramped?
Yeah, my house is being renovated.
Don't you have control over it?
Can't you just say, Hey!
No more orange boxes!
I tried, and then they go like, no, we gotta play Portal.
Portal's awesome!
And then they're like, Team Fortress is awesome.
And then I'm like, you haven't played it very much.
It's like, yeah, it's very hardcore.
Yeah, it's very hardcore!
Offer them a cake if they shut up.
Wait, now, so did you just call in tonight to bitch about your own show's politics, or what's the deal?
No, no, not at all.
Alright, what else is up?
You talked about Portal and all those games.
I guess it's true.
I haven't really played them still yet.
I'm like the least coolest kid on the block.
So you're just like me.
Okay.
Now you're in the same boat.
Well, except Loki, one of the cool kids on the block, is loaning me his copy.
So maybe by next week I'll be sitting here giggling going, hee hee, the cake is alive, hee hee hee, you know, and all that stuff that everybody else is doing.
So we'll see.
Do you think, does this kind of stuff kind of irritate you when people go too far?
It pisses me off.
Really?
I'm sorry.
It pisses me off, especially when a commercial that goes the greatest game of all time.
Mm-hmm.
And with the PlayStation 3 version being very unplayable, Gabe Newell must really hate that thing.
Apparently there's not a lot of nice things to say about it from Valve.
I love it.
Technically it's like, I hate the PlayStation 3.
I'm just going to gimp it.
Apparently a lot of folks are doing that.
Alright, well, any final thoughts for our listeners, RavensDolphin?
No, but don't be in a cramped room.
ZENICOR ZENICOR ZENICOR
Same old stuff, different day, man.
Gotcha.
What's your gaming week been like?
Actually, first off, did you have a good Thanksgiving?
Yeah, I got turkey for days, dude.
Awesome.
Leftovers.
Turkey and then turkey everything for a whole week.
Nothing but turkey and sleeping for the next half week or so.
Gotcha.
So how was your gaming week?
What do we owe the call to tonight?
Well, I've been getting all of my November 20th gaming out of the way.
So I finally managed to finish Assassin's Creed and saw the...
O.M.G.
Spoilers!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It sounds like they already know there's going to be an Assassin's Creed at some point.
Yeah, they were talking about the sequel.
Oh, wow.
Very cool.
Anything else you've been playing, Xenocor?
Oh, yeah.
I've been getting Mass Effect out the way.
Ah, how is that?
I have yet to check that out.
I'm very, very curious about Mass Effect.
Well, Loki, did you play the beta version or the demo version they had at the trade shows, or did you actually play a full version of it?
No, I played a full version of it.
All right, because...
After the review I heard last week, I'm not sure if you were playing the same game I am, because there wasn't that much talking before I started shooting anyway.
No, there was quite a bit of talking.
I disagree.
But anyway, I'm used to Bioware stuff, so I guess I sort of gloss over it.
See, I didn't play anything from Bioware.
I didn't play Jade Empire or anything like that.
So, you know, maybe this... I could have been nitpicking.
I only have 30 minutes of my lunch, and I just want to kill me.
Oh, well, there you go.
And, you know, hey, 25 minutes of that lunch has spent talking...
You missed alien sex.
I didn't miss it.
There's no fucking alien sex in there.
It's implied sex.
That's bullshit.
Loki says fucking lifetime TV implied sex is what that is.
Penetration or it didn't happen.
Well, I can't confirm or deny that right now because apparently, based off how far I've gotten into the game, the scene they show isn't from a party member.
It's from an NPC.
So if there is some party member...
I'll eventually get around to playing it.
I mean, it's just right now there's, like you said, too many things to play.
I'm trying to get rid of some of this, like,
I know you play a lot of RPGs, Xenocore.
What do you think about the conversation style in Mass Effect?
Is it really cool?
Is it something you'd like to see in more games?
Thanks for watching!
All right.
Well, again, I'm like Loki.
I didn't play the previous games.
It'd be good in a Star Trek game.
You know what, guys?
I think I need to introduce you to Knights of the Old Republic, to Neverwinter Knights, to Jade Empire, all these bioware games that you haven't played.
None of those games I've played.
None of those games I've played.
You need to.
There's just too... You know, and I gotta say, and I realize there's a lot of folks listening to this show think we're experts on everything, but, you know, we're gamers just like you guys, and we don't have time for everything.
But I definitely want to at least look at everything if I have a chance.
That's why I miss E3, because at E3 you could at least look at everything and kind of go, yeah, I'm more interested in this, or I'm not so interested in this.
All right, well, Xenocor, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
Yeah, just one other point on Mass Effect.
The rover kicks ass.
I mean, the Warthog is shit now.
The Land Rover you get to use in Mass Effect is the new ride I want, man.
Interesting.
There's so much detail put into the way that vehicle just operates.
I could just drive it all day on the planets and stuff.
It's great.
Very cool.
It's kind of interesting hearing about a lot of big games of the year getting compared to Halo 3, where it looks like Halo 3 may not be the game of the year.
There's all these other games that are doing these other little things, whereas a lot of folks kind of thought Halo 3 may take the crown.
It may not, but we'll see.
Yeah, it's because it's Halo 2.5 and not Halo 3.
Cool.
Omega 5 is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade this week.
I'm looking for a kick-ass shooter.
Wait, that's not the same thing as the Omega Warhawk expansion.
No.
Omega 5.
It's a Hudson shooter.
Interesting.
All right.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
What's up?
This is Dillinger.
Hi, Dillinger.
I'm usually Ryoma, but I kind of felt like a name change.
Alright, well, hey, you know what?
When it's your nickname, you have the right to do that.
You're a little bit quiet, so make sure you get a little closer to your mic and tell us what's on your mind.
Alright, I wanted to talk a bit about Mario Galaxy.
I've basically been playing it over the entire Thanksgiving break.
And I've got to say that if you've got a Wii, you have to buy this game.
It is kind of childish, and it's a bit easy at the beginning.
but once you really get into the game especially the later stuff like you only have to have it's another one of the you have to or there's 120 stars that you can get and you only have to have 60 to go to the final boss but the final 60 is just it is better than everything else in the game it is better than a lot of the stuff in Mario 64 in my opinion there's some really innovative stuff in there I think that Mario Galaxy is basically the definite game to get for the Wii
You know, it's kind of interesting because I can hear the excitement in your voice when you're talking about games.
And when you hear that excitement, it makes other people excited.
So certainly I liked the bits of Mario Galaxy that I have played so far.
I haven't bought the full game yet, but I'm kind of curious.
What did you think about the motion in that game?
Meaning like, you know how it was more of a round environment?
I kind of thought it was a game where I'd be able to get disoriented very easily, even more so than most 3D games.
Do you find that?
Like, was it kind of hard to...
Not really.
I found that you get used to it after a bit.
I mean, I've had a couple of friends over that have played it.
My brothers played it.
And it's a little weird in the beginning, obviously, because you're getting used to this whole new orientation.
But after a little bit, you really get used to it.
Have you tried any of the co-op mode?
Because I know you said you had your friends over.
And I noticed in a commercial I saw the other day, they were really hype in the co-op mode.
How is it?
Co-op isn't really anything great.
All that you can do is you can move your Wiimote around and you can collect the stars for them.
Or you can stun the enemies.
Or actually you can make them jump.
So it's great because you can really mess around with your friends.
They'll likely try to jump somewhere and you can tell them to jump earlier.
It's pretty stupid, but it's good for a laugh.
Very cool.
Anything else on the Wii that you're looking forward to this holiday season?
Besides Super Mario?
Trauma Center.
I'm a huge Trauma Center guy.
I loved Second Opinion.
I never played the DS one.
I sold my DS before it came out.
But I'm really looking forward to New Blood.
I know it's already out, but I also really want to get Geometry Wars.
I played it once at my friend's house on Xbox on the 360 off of the Live Arcade or whatever the hell it's called.
And it was
I vaguely remember you guys doing an interview in Part B of 251
I don't remember if it was that or what, but yeah, it's somewhere in there, so check it out.
Also, what was the other thing I said?
Trauma Center is a game I like as well, and that reminds me, that's something I want to look at, too, is the new Trauma Center game, because it's not just a DS port, like it was actually made for the Wii, so I'm excited about it.
Yeah, I heard it got great reviews.
Oh, I'm excited, I've got to check that out.
Dragon Force is the greatest band ever.
I mean,
I freaked out when I heard that they were going to be in Guitar Hero 3 even though I can't be through the fire and the plan's an expert.
Rock on.
I agree.
Dragon Force is amazing.
I still want them on the show.
We'll see.
Maybe that'll be my Christmas present.
We'll see.
That'd be great.
Alright, well take care, Dillinger.
It was nice to have you on the program.
You too.
And have fun with Mario Galaxy and good luck in getting all those 120 what-have-you stars that are in that game.
It's nuts.
Any other last-minute stories you got for us, Loki?
Um...
There's one I forgot.
I didn't make show role for some reason.
But Knights Journey into Dreams is coming to the PlayStation 2.
The original Knights that was on the Saturn.
Nice.
You know, I think probably didn't make the show role because we had a short show tonight.
But I'm glad that's what I didn't put on there.
So, oh, well, then I forgot.
No, I do remember reading that, though.
So very cool.
Let's go to one more call for tonight.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Caller, are you there?
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
If you're there, say hello.
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
Caller's not there.
Remember, folks, you want to use Echo 123 to test your connection before you give us a call.
Or you can just use a regular telephone as well.
That always works.
Always got to love when the last call of the night is something that fails.
Anyhow, let's go ahead and wrap up.
On that note, let's wrap up the show tonight.
So we're going to do our challenge on Op 11, yes?
We're going to do our crossbow challenge?
Yes, you're welcome.
Awesome.
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
If there's no other last-minute stories?
No, no last-minute stories.
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
Drew, thanks for filling in tonight.
Sorry you got robbed of half a show, but come back.
I am impressed.
I hope that...
I need my WoW!
Loki!
I feel hot and I hope I don't have a fever because that would suck.
And my final thought is I want more pumpkin pie.
And then I want pumpkin coffee and pumpkin everything.
I want pumpkin everything.
That's what I want.
All right.
