Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're live here on Sunday evening taping and some housekeeping items I've neglected to mention.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In part A of tonight's show.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I actually did a guest stint on another show this week so you should check that out.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's called Ultimate Quest is the show.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And you've probably heard Footy Monster, maybe Xenocore call in this show.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well they are hosts on another show over at All Games and it's called Ultimate Quest.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And that show should be out this week.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think they said Monday night or Tuesday afternoon-ish so check them out at UltimateQuest.net.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We had a conversation about MMOs.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And you know I was kind of like the guy there that played WoW and Final Fantasy XI.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But it was a good panel because they had another guy that was like City of Heroes and a couple were playing Eve Online.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And you know lots of different MMOs being talked about.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We were kind of talking about societies and getting into a pretty in-depth discussion.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Good times, I approve.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So thanks to the kids at Ultimate Quest for having me on their program.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now we can get back into some gaming news.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, so Super Mario Galaxy of course is coming out not next week but the week after next.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And you know it's been revealed that there's going to be a certain hidden playable character in the game.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Apparently when you secure all 120 stars in the game, complete all the purple coin missions,

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
defeated Bowser a second time, you can play as Luigi.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And actually Luigi, he will jump higher and further, also runs faster but has trouble stopping.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And says otherwise they have the same moves but it actually makes the game a little bit harder.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's kind of cool. That's just like Luigi in the Lost Levels or Super Mario Bros. 2 Japanese, however you want to call it.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Luigi jumped higher but he was harder to control.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He was like constantly on ice basically. Luigi on ice.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Luigi needs no sneakers.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Not just a palette swap.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
At least it's not, you know, Luigi's Mansion.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah that would be, I'm glad it's not Luigi's Mansion embedded in the game.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Although I don't know, part of me thinks Luigi's Mansion got a bad rap. I don't know.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I actually liked Luigi's Mansion until it got to the baby part and then the baby part kind of creeped me out.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Really? Well I thought you liked scary video games though.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There's a difference between stupid scary and like, I like Silent Hill and I like Resident Evil.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mental screwing with your mind scary.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well thanks to the ESRB ratings some new games have been leaked for upcoming US Virtual Console releases.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Alien Soldier is one of the games that is going to be coming to Virtual Console soon.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
As well as Shining Force 2 and Bubble Bobble will be coming to Virtual Console.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And it is assumed that they have worked it out so that you can get past level 30 in the Virtual Console release of Bubble Bobble.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's kind of a dated joke now. I wonder if people get that.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And apparently some late breaking news because we do tape live on Sunday nights.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Apparently some websites. Who put this, Go Nintendo?

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go Nintendo had a video or I should say a voice mail from Mario himself.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Charles Martinet.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes. Announcing Super Mario Bros. 3 will be out tomorrow.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I love Super Mario Bros. 3.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mario 3 is fucking rad. I love playing through Mario 3 and not using warp zones.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because I love Giant World. Who doesn't love Giant World?

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Giant World is the best, but you know what? My favorite is going in Kuriboh's shoe.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There's only like one level in the whole game where you do that, huh?

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not even a mandatory level, is it?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But with the Game Boy, with the Game Genie code back in the day, you could keep the shoe through other levels.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Awesome.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Which sort of made it stupid for the ones you have to fly to get to shit though.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now all you need is to actually be able to play this game online.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Like imagine if you could be Mario and play against a Luigi that's millions of miles away.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You know that's not going to happen.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Fun. It should.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But will it?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't know.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Anyway, for UK Virtual Console, we've got some fun stuff.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Sonic 3D Flickies Island for 800 Wii points will be out.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The Sonic 3D games were sort of interesting.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They weren't really 3D, just sort of 3D. But anyway.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't believe it's not 3D.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, I can't believe it's not 3D, exactly.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And then we also have, as soon as it loads, Samurai Ghost, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Which is a side-scrolling, you know, slash fighter shooter, you know, guy with a sword game.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I think it's funny, the whole purpose of the game, according to the opening screen, is it's an order from the King of Heaven.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And then we have Art of Fighting, Neo Geo.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I don't need to say anything more about Art of Fighting, because that's the game that gave us...

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
King.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No. Well, besides King, it gave us the two characters that spawned the introduction of Dan Hibiki in the Street Fighter series.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Which would be Ryo and Robert Garcia.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Was Dan supposed to be like a parody of them or something?

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, he was.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
How funny.

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because Ryo was like a Ryu knock-off.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And Robert Garcia had, I guess, he had some other moves, so they actually combined the two characters into, you know, Mr. Sucktastic Godoken.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I thought it was great.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And again, keep in mind, Dan's like one of my favorite characters, especially in Puzzle Fighter, because you have to be really freaking good to beat people in Puzzle Fighter using Dan.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Because he drops all red blocks.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So you have to drop a lot really fast.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, you have to be really good, and I can proudly say that I've beaten somebody using Devilot.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Or pray that a red, uh, a red break gem never falls.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Seriously.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But, you know, I digress.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Which is the whole point of the show, digression.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Awesome.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Anyways, so, you know, we don't really talk too much about Atari.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, they don't give us a lot that's worth talking about anymore.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In case you haven't heard, Atari, they have not too many licensed games out there.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I mean, I think the last few licensed games haven't been that great.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You know, what with the, um, they used to have the Driver series.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Of course, they lost the Driver series.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And now they're battling to retain the Dragon Ball Z license, because pretty much the only big game that they release every year is the Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi game.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And now that might not be the case.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Just one? I thought every year they would release over 9000 of these games.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They may sell only over 9000, but no, I don't know.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's kind of sad to see, because really all that they're going to be left after this is gone is pretty much alone in the dark.

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You know what?

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is what I have to say, first of all, two things.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
One about Dragon Ball Z and one about Atari.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Dragon Ball Z has been off the air in Japan when I graduated college.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, I didn't graduate college, but when I was out of high school.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No, I take that back because I had an episode taped off the TV.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay, the series ended in the mid-90s.

111
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We are now in the late 2000s.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's old. Drop it.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, they have Dragon Ball GT now.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's Drag on Ball.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, Dragon Ball GT has been over and done with for years.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Just find something.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, no, now we're getting Bleach, and Bleach is the new Dragon Ball.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But we're in the United States, not Japan.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But it still doesn't mean it's not even old over here.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's still old.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know, the whole thing is saturated.

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And that and Atari, oh my God.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ActDef says in our chatroom, chat.orangetonsharing.com, ActDef says,

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Atari, doing nothing since the 1980s.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And to tell Ranma, Dragon Ball GT, in my opinion, does kind of count,

126
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
because it was going back to the original, you know, flair of what Dragon Ball was.

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But Dragon Ball Z was better.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, I would like to make a point here real quick.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is how bad this is going to be for Atari.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, let me put it this way.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is their big games for the fourth quarter.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You have Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkai G3, okay.

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Godzilla Unleashed, which is a Godzilla fighting game on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and the DS.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I kid you not, I kid you not, Jenga on the Wii and the DS.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I remember reporting on this game when it was first announced.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We were like, the fuck? Can't you just play, like, real Jenga?

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Which I believe they did at the Penny Arcade Expo.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They played real Jenga.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And to be honest, then they also have another, like, classic compilation game coming through the PSP.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Because that's all that ever comes out of the PSP.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's it.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's all they have coming out of this here.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Alone in the Dark, whatever it is, Fie, or Alone in the Dark, New Alone in the Dark.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Alone in the Dark, Tim Curry's voice isn't in this game, so don't buy it.

145
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Basically, right?

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, I have to make a correction and I have to do this by timeline.

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh, you know, I got Alone in the Dark mixed up with Gabriel...

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Never mind, forget it.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Gabriel Knight?

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, forget it.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Dragon Ball Z was replaced by Rurouni Kenshin.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Rurouni Kenshin was replaced by Naruto.

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And now Bleach is doing its damnedest.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So that's the transition I'd like to point out.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Seriously, companies, stop making so many Naruto games.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean, there's, like, five every year.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Seriously, we don't need that many Naruto games.

159
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think I have, like, a stack of them in our vault collecting dust.

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
In the vault.

161
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No, it really is the vault.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's a whole room dedicated to my video game collection.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright.

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, anyhow, you know, they say imitation is the finest form of flattery, but...

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know about this one, because apparently, there is now a... Walmart is now selling these little knockoff Wiimotes.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a device made by Toy Quest.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And what it is, it basically looks like a Wiimote, but it has a little LCD screen on the Wiimote.

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And you actually play tennis with this Wiimote.

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a little tiny LCD screen, but I don't even think it has motion control or whatever.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because the screen is so fucking tiny.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It would be hilarious if it did.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you swung it, how would you see it?

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll swing it, and then, oh shit.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You know what? Someone needs to hack it to be a VMU emulator.

175
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And put a chow on there.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Seriously, these things cost under $20.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to say it said it was, like, $7 for this thing.

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And that might be too much for this.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So, I don't know about that.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But, yeah, if you want to...

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Quality.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's say, like, you know, it might be a really cruel joke to play on someone.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Let's say you have this annoying little cousin that wants a Wii for Christmas.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You could get them this, and say, well, you know, Santa gave all the Wiis to the good kids.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Somebody had this left over for you to give to you.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, people should give, like, crappy useless toys to the bad children instead of coal.

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Because you can actually use coal.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is what you get for being a bad kid.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Is that like, you know, driving kids by a burned-out factory, telling them that Disneyland burned down or something?

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, that was deep thoughts.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I know that was deep thoughts.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
With Jack Handy.

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Anyhow, so yeah, those are kind of stupid.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And you know what?

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
These types of things, and these knock-offs, and these unoriginal bastards, and tiny little LCD screens that try to pass for a game.

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
These things just piss us off, and it makes us angsty.

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And when we get mad, people die.

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Or at least the FUs of the week are unleashed.

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
FU goes towards the digestion problems I inherited from my mother.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Mom, fuck your jeans.

201
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean, I love you.

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And her birthday tomorrow, so happy birthday to my mom, who will be 48.

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Happy birthday, Jamie's mom.

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But anyway, yeah, everything I eat really makes me sick, so I'm just gonna stop eating altogether.

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Except for couscous.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm gonna be living on a solid diet of couscous and wonton soup.

207
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Because those are two things that don't make me sick.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You can change what you look like.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Online multiplayer, you can change what you look like.

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Put system link for some reason, and they're just like, ah, fuck it.

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So, fuck them.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I continued FU to the bruise on my leg that still kind of hurts this week, but at least it's getting a little better.

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Maybe I can roll my pants up far enough I can show you one.

214
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Actually, I probably can't. My bruise is in here. I can't roll my pants up that far.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I might be a little too much skin for operator 11, so no show for you.

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was gonna say one more thing real quick.

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What?

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I tried to perform a level 3 execution on my wife's leg.

219
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You know, Manhunt 2 reference.

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
She attacked her leg with her back claw, and it sliced it.

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It looked like she was trying to cut her leg off or something.

222
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What a kitty.

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But, you know, without...

224
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It was the cutest level 3 execution ever.

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's it. My FU just went to my bruise on my leg.

226
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So, at least I don't have to have the Band-Aid on it anymore.

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Puppy!

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
My FU goes to your neighborhood for there being no street lights and street signs covered by trees.

229
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Because I almost got lost getting here because I couldn't read anything.

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah, I followed him all the way from the big main road over, and I was like,

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hey, I bet that's Puppy, because I saw the college sticker on your car.

232
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And then I was like, he went right past Rob Street.

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I almost went right past Rob Street.

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It is kind of, yeah, they don't really have street lights here.

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They didn't invent them yet, I guess, when these houses were built. What can I say?

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's rural.

237
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And FU to the housing market, because I got scared a little bit.

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And when half the people that I work with at my company got laid off this week.

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No!

240
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Well, I do drafting work for a carpenter.

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And they just laid off a bunch of their foremen.

242
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I hope I get laid off.

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, seriously, because if I get laid off, I get like three months of severance pay and collect unemployment while I start my massage business.

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That'd be fantastic.

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Awesome.

246
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That would be nice.

247
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Nice little cushion.

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Alright, well that's going to do it for our FUs of the week.

249
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

250
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Shall we?

251
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We shall.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We shall.

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Dark Soccer, why don't you take it away?

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't wanna.

255
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You gotta.

256
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why?

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Because I said so.

258
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay, fine.

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
For anyone who follows the Child's Play charity, the 5th annual Child's Play charity drive is beginning.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Basically, the whole charity was the brainchild of the Penny Arcade powers that be.

261
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And is now, you know, basically the gaming community's way of giving to those in need.

262
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know, for children who are in hospitals in 25 states and 5 countries.

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So you can make your, you can donate your items through Amazon and it is considered a tax-deductible gift.

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So keep that in mind if you have those deductions coming up.

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The drive, sorry, is, their fundraiser dinner, I apologize, is set to take place on December 11th at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So go play.

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Get the brainstorming, folks.

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We need to think of what we here at OLR can do to help out this lovely charity that gives gamers a good name.

269
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So we'll have to think of something we can donate or a fundraiser we can do.

270
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Maybe we'll have a ditter-thon, a DDR-thon.

271
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

272
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay, maybe not.

273
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You never know.

274
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You never know.

275
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We'll think of something.

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So one awesome game that's coming out this year has gone gold and that would be Crysis.

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's due out November 16th so I hope you have your new PC by now because you're going to need it.

278
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And of course it will be the first game to utilize the CryEngine 2.

279
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No, that's not the same engine used in Yaris.

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's a different CryEngine.

281
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And of course, hopefully it will be coming to the console soon.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There is a single player demo that's available now which hackers have gone ahead

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
and poked their noses through some of the DirectX workaround codes inside there.

284
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And they've found stuff like hidden weapons, vehicles, and bad guys from the full version.

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So now with a little bit of cutting and pasting they're able to play with every gun in the game

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
as well as tanks and attack chopper.

287
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Sounds like how I play games.

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah, it does.

289
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
All the guns and tank and attack chopper right next to me in Cooking Mama.

290
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Awesome.

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Well this might be a game that Loki is going to want to hack too.

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know.

293
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But this is the American McGee version of Grimm and it's coming to GameTap.

294
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I actually did play a little bit of GameTap this week so I actually saw this ad.

295
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They're actually going to be releasing a 24 episode series of this.

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So it's kind of like think Sam and Max but like really, really long.

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's going to start in 2008 in the spring and they're already running the ads on it.

298
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And the little quote from the ad says,

299
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This spring American McGee thrust you into an incredible adventure built around the world's best known fairy tales.

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Meet Snow White, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, and more of your favorites in 24 game episodes.

301
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And of course American McGee did that Alice in Wonderland game that was pretty fucked.

302
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So I'm sure you're going to see lots of your fairy tales done the right way.

303
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Dark and gory the way they were originally.

304
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will be looking forward to, I imagine this is going to have to be in it,

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The Hansel and Gretel because I can't wait to push the witch in the oven.

306
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That'll be fun.

307
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The original fairy tales were all kinds of messed up.

308
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I mean who would read that to their children?

309
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I would.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My mom handed me the book and said go read it and don't come bother me until you finish this chapter.

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I would like to see the grim fairy tales done by Sam and Max because I think that would be awesome.

312
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That would be kind of fun.

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Anyways.

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Sony is going to be doing an animated Resident Evil movie.

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's actually a CG animation.

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They're calling it Biohazard Degeneration in Japan.

317
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
There's a presumption that it's going to be called Resident Evil Finding Necro over here.

318
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Which is kind of a dumb name.

319
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They said it's going to have groundbreaking visual effects and a brand new storyline.

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So.

321
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh well.

322
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We'll see.

323
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's supposed to be out in 2008.

324
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Nah, we won't see.

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't really want to see it.

326
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I mean I'm kind of over Resident Evil like 10 years ago.

327
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I liked the last movie.

328
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you're over Resident Evil, perhaps you may be interested in a few other films that are coming.

329
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Including Onimusha which is starting production in April.

330
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Apparently they also have a poster now revealed for the Tekken movie.

331
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Which the poster looks stupid.

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I might add, it's a giant T that looks like it's being held up.

333
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
T for Tekken!

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Wow!

335
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's creative.

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yay!

337
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's already down the road of DOA.

338
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's apparently the Onimusha adaption is expected to begin in April of 2008.

339
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And of course Silent Hill director Christopher Gons is going to be at the helm.

340
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well that may not suck.

341
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
May not.

342
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
May not.

343
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
May not.

344
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And unfortunately the Tekken poster, if I were to sum up the movie based on the poster,

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I would say suck.

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And based on the poster I'd be all, where's Big Bird?

347
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:34,000
To tell me, this episode was brought to you by the letter T and the number 69.

348
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And how many times have fighting games made good movies?

349
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Hey, I remember the Tekken anime that came out.

350
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Well, animes are usually better than movies anyways.

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The Tekken anime, my problem with that is that it was all completely done on computer,

352
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and I prefer cel animation.

353
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So, that's what was bad about that.

354
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, it also had a lot of butt rock in it.

355
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Well, the American one did.

356
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yeah, the US one.

357
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Alright, well we're talking a lot about video games becoming movies, but now let's mention

358
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
movies becoming video games.

359
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Pirates of the Caribbean, of course, actually that was a ride at Disneyland first and foremost.

360
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Then it was a movie, and now it is an online MMO.

361
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We've talked about this on the game before that it was coming.

362
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's now here.

363
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If you want to check it out, piratesonline.com.

364
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The basic game is free, but for $10 a month you get full access.

365
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The game, by the way, is based off of the Toontown online engine,

366
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
so don't expect any cutting edge graphics.

367
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm also wondering if it's based off Toontown online.

368
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That probably means you can't actually type your own sentences.

369
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You have to make things from the pre-rendered things that are in there

370
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because we have to keep our children safe because these are Disney games.

371
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Like using the Final Fantasy XI macros?

372
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't know that for sure.

373
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Don't quote me on that.

374
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't know if that's the case in this game.

375
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't know if any of our chatters have played it,

376
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
but I just know in Toontown that was the case.

377
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I had a friend that played Toontown for a long-ass time, actually.

378
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Pirates of the Caribbean, I wouldn't mind checking this out.

379
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I would check it out, but puzzle pirates would probably still be better.

380
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Maybe.

381
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And plus, my fondness for Pirates of the Caribbean is the ride, not the movie.

382
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I know that might be like blessed for me to some people,

383
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but I could care less about John E. Depp.

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Although he was a kind of cool addition to the ride

385
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and some of the other stuff they added on the ride.

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Anyhow, some of the stuff we're going to add to the Part B of our podcast tonight

387
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
is a segment we love and know and have here every week on the program.

388
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's the mailbag, and it's our chance to interact with you, the listener,

389
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
when you send us e-mails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

390
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Dark Sakura will pull out a few of her favorite e-mails,

391
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
and this week she has to be really picky

392
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
because we actually got a lot of e-mails this week.

393
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, I still have a number I'm going to have to end up reading.

394
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Sadly, Dark Sakura is going to have to be a bit choosy this week

395
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
in what e-mails she's reading.

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Wait, did we get any jokes?

397
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We'll see.

398
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We will see.

399
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
All right, well, we have one that says,

400
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Hey guys, I was wondering if you could recommend some older 360 games

401
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
that might be worth picking up used.

402
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I was thinking about PSU, but not sure if it was any good.

403
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Thanks.

404
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This comes from Mark.

405
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
PSU sucks, so don't play it.

406
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You're not going to get a deal on PSU either

407
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
because you still have that $10 monthly fee.

408
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't think you can get that used because of that.

409
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I think there's that whole, I don't know.

410
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
No, you can't.

411
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You can't because you have to register an account.

412
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'll give you mine.

413
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Do you want my copy?

414
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't want it. Maybe the listener does.

415
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Get in touch with the listener.

416
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You can also play the offline version for free,

417
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
so don't necessarily think you have to play it online.

418
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Plus, the expansion is coming out here pretty soon.

419
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
They've already done a butt load.

420
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
My friend, Julie, Castame19, she plays a butt ton.

421
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
She is always on that fucking game whenever I'm on live.

422
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
She does nothing but play that game.

423
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Wow, amazing.

424
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
She's like, that's her ever crack.

425
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Tips from the chat room.

426
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Rob with two B's is mentioning Circuit City has PSU on the cheap.

427
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So if you're interested in that,

428
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
some of the folks are recommending some games.

429
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Act Deft recommending Condemned.

430
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
DMN recommending Crackdown.

431
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Crackdown is the I like jumping game.

432
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I recommend staying the hell away from Perfect Dark Zero, first off.

433
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I liked Perfect Dark Zero.

434
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You would.

435
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But I would suggest Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

436
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
To me, that is the best 360 title.

437
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Burnout.

438
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yes.

439
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay, I do like crashing.

440
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Even if it is an old game with souped up graphics.

441
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
How about Test Drive Unlimited?

442
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That was a good game that I think...

443
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
How about no?

444
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
How about Kiss My Butt?

445
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If you want some older games that have dropped in price, Dead Rising.

446
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah, Dead Rising is a good one.

447
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If you can find that.

448
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Actually, Far Cry Instincts Predator wasn't that bad.

449
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I thought you said good games.

450
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And then I would also say probably not Prey, that's for sure.

451
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Definitely not Chromehounds.

452
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Hey, I liked Prey.

453
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Definitely not Chromehounds.

454
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Prey was like Ghetto Portal.

455
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But I wouldn't buy Burnout, because there's a new Burnout game coming out in January.

456
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I would say probably...

457
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Gosh.

458
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay, we've given enough suggestions.

459
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Well, it's not that old, but Oblivion is also really good for a solo game.

460
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Alright, you have plenty of suggestions.

461
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
We have an email from another Mark.

462
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Your suggestion quota is up.

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hi, Mark.

464
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Hi, it's amazing.

465
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
My brother and I were talking about Count Decula, but we couldn't remember the name.

466
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We also said you can't do that on television.

467
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Farf.

468
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
About Loki's a few of the week to women.

469
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If you haven't learned by now, you will.

470
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You as a male will always lose arguments against women.

471
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I didn't believe it when people told me.

472
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
True statement.

473
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But it's true.

474
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Men are from Mars and women have already invaded it and destroyed all that are holy.

475
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Of course we have, because we're excellent.

476
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
So, I'm trying to find more short ones, because we've got a couple of long ones.

477
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Wait, hold on, because I'm trying to load a little something for that last emailer.

478
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Because I played the You Can't Do That television theme earlier.

479
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Castle Decula.

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Home for many centuries to a dreadful dynasty of vicious...

481
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Tell me you would not play a fucking video game based on this.

482
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This would be awesome.

483
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The castle of Decula.

484
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Legend has it that these foul beings can be destroyed by escape through the heart or exposure to sub-light.

485
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
This does not suffice, however, for they may be brought back to life by means of a secret.

486
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I apologize, the audio is so low.

487
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Once a century, when the moon is in the eighth house...

488
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
We've been wearing blood.

489
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Are you kidding?

490
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The latest reincarnation did not run, according to plan.

491
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Ooh.

492
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, it's a kitchen.

493
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Here's the techno part.

494
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes.

495
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
In the vampire hall of fame, yeah, there's not a vampire in the other house.

496
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You won't bite me from there, cause he's a virgin, yeah.

497
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And things never burn flat for a while.

498
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
If you're looking for someone, you can always count upon.

499
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This is the most random opening of Decula.

500
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Count Decula.

501
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
For anyone who doesn't know, God, it's so loud.

502
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Count Decula was actually a character from Danger Mouse.

503
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Awesome.

504
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
If anyone who ever watched Danger Mouse.

505
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So this other one says the classic game of the week segment seems to be like obscure cult hit of the week.

506
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It says will you be featuring games that are a little more known to us?

507
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But it's cyberbots.

508
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah, like everybody knows cyberbots.

509
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
To be honest, I think part of the charm...

510
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
A lot of people know cyberbots.

511
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Part of the charm is that she's featuring games that a lot of us miss.

512
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
To me, that's kind of the point.

513
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I mean, if she were to go back and say today's classic game of the week is Contra.

514
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Y'all fucking played Contra.

515
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Maybe she'll feature it later.

516
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I don't know.

517
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I kind of like the obscurity for now.

518
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Well, keep in mind that all of the classic games that I like are really the more obscure ones anyway.

519
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So, of course, if I'm going to be picking out the games, I'm going to be picking out all the weird shit that I like.

520
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You know, but I covered Fantasy Zone. That's not obscure.

521
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Yeah.

522
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You know, okay, I'll do Guardian Legend.

523
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Even that's kind of obscure for some people, but...

524
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
This is my favorite game.

525
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I say do what you want.

526
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You know, I'm going to do what I want.

527
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That's right. I'm going to do what I want.

528
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But...

529
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I go to school and I kill people.

530
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm wrong with gangs.

531
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yo, and so you know what?

532
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah, I digitally inserted Jabba the Hutt back in Star Wars.

533
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll do what I want.

534
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm wrong with gangs.

535
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
To be fair, I do like a good number of, you know, I guess more mainstream titles.

536
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You know, I won't do one of Colibri.

537
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You know, if anyone remembers that 32X classic.

538
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But, you know, I would do, you know, like Knuckles Chaotix.

539
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah, that one was cool.

540
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Alright.

541
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Or, you know, Space Harrier.

542
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Thanks for the feedback, but she'll do what she wants.

543
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But do yourself a favor.

544
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Check out some of these obscure games because they were actually kind of fun.

545
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah, I mean, you can find emulators of Cotton.

546
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Cotton's great.

547
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Cotton came out in the U.S. on Neo Geo Pocket Color.

548
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And on the...

549
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No, just on Neo Geo Pocket Color.

550
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You know what?

551
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Don't bother defending.

552
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Just say, I'm going to do what I want.

553
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm saying how people can find these games easily.

554
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh, okay.

555
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So it did have U.S. release.

556
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Anyway, this one comes from J-Rod.

557
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Hi, J-Rod.

558
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Love the show you guys put on.

559
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I really dig how the show is live.

560
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I have two guitars on my PS2 with both Guitar Hero 1 and 2.

561
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Now, the problem is I don't have my PS2 anymore, but I do have a PS3, a 60 gig that can play

562
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
the old PS2 games.

563
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Apparently, Sony and everyone else didn't bother to make an adapter to get the Guitar

564
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Hero controllers to work on the PS3.

565
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I was wondering if any of you guys had any first-hand experiences or knew anyone who

566
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
did with the aftermarket adapters out there and could give me a recommendation or review

567
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
of any of them.

568
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Thanks and keep up the awesome show.

569
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I think Pelican makes one that works.

570
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
There is an adapter out there I know that works.

571
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I would bet money it causes a delay, though.

572
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't think it did.

573
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Really?

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah.

575
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I know there's one that we did as a story a while back.

576
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Luckily, I didn't actually bet the money.

577
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That actually does work, so I don't know.

578
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Xenocore in chat room.

579
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
See, well, we don't know.

580
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We can always rely on chat room.

581
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Xenocore in chat says, not true.

582
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I have the adapter.

583
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
So there you have it.

584
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Whatever.

585
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't know.

586
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Well, also, I think that it's great that there's a...

587
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Sony doesn't love you there.

588
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,920
I also think it's fantastic that it says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home

589
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,000
of the Neverending Salads.

590
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,320
I don't know why I find that funny.

591
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Olive Garden.

592
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Not for the Salads, though.

593
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Do I know?

594
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,320
OLR, I appreciate that you guys tell us the Japanese release dates, but I was wondering

595
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,000
if you guys have any Japanese listeners, and I guess this comes from Thomas.

596
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I think we do.

597
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm pretty sure we do.

598
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,640
When we check the stats, we do see quite a number of connections from Japan, and we've

599
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,360
gotten emails from listeners in Japan before, too.

600
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,600
We've got people all over the world, because we are cool that way.

601
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
So now for the really freaking long emails.

602
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,160
How about that?

603
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Yay.

604
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,000
Really freaking long email segment.

605
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,760
Dear OLR, pointing to a letter that was sent to you last week, it really assumes to me

606
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,920
that a fellow gamer can be so blatantly ignorant.

607
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,840
Has anyone ever considered the fact that one of the main reasons that Nintendo has managed

608
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,160
to stay afloat for so long is because of its first party games?

609
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,320
Starting with the Nintendo 64, the graphics of the system sucked.

610
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,200
The audio play was horrible, but it still managed to give you a few of the great franchises

611
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,680
that you and I loved, like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and other well-known franchises, and bring

612
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:59,440
them, though it still looked horrible, the GameCube may have been a different story.

613
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,000
In my opinion, the GameCube was a great system, while not on par with that of the Xbox and

614
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,120
PlayStation 2, it had excellent graphics, and almost all games played in high frame

615
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
rate.

616
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:30,320
It was a big deal when Prime came out, because it was OMGZ Metroid.

617
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:54,440
It also brought your favorite franchise into beautiful 3D detail, but it would have been

618
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,640
so much better if they had online play.

619
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,920
I wouldn't have even bought my GameCube if it didn't have a new Metroid game.

620
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,680
Nintendo's first party developers have managed to bring back our favorite franchises and

621
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,640
make us love them that much more with each new title.

622
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,120
It's mainly because of the fact that Nintendo first party developers and the fact that they

623
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,600
make such great games are the only reason Nintendo managed this far.

624
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:22,040
Though I may not know everything, I just want to point out that these few details are far

625
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
as it goes with Nintendo's first party games and developers.

626
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,000
Let's just hope that it doesn't repeat any past mistakes.

627
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,620
To the Yaris, this is a letter that was sent to the Xbox Live Arcade.

628
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
It said,

629
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,260
Dear Xbox Live Arcade,

630
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,840
We have always had a great relationship.

631
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,340
The day I met you, you sent me Geometry Wars.

632
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
Now you sent me Yaris.

633
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,760
Does this mean you're breaking up with me?

634
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Sincerely, Anonymous

635
00:34:41,760 --> 00:35:07,240
Hi O.L.R., I love your show, y'all are amazing, do we have a southern guy?

636
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Cool.

637
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,760
I listened to y'all everywhere I go, and named my firstborn daughter Skye.

638
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Wow.

639
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Send the birth certificate as proof, I don't believe it.

640
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,720
So on and so forth, pleasantries aside, to beat the proverbial dead horse, your qualms

641
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,280
concerning the term microtransactions would give even Captain Jean-Luc Picard a headache

642
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
of massive proportions.

643
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,040
Oh, not this debate again.

644
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,480
Granted, I agree with you wholeheartedly, Dark Soccer, that a transaction on any scale

645
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,140
is a transaction no matter the amount of money involved.

646
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,840
The term microtransaction is merely an industry buzzword to help encourage sales of downloadable

647
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,680
data, unlock content, buy the ignorant masses.

648
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,560
It's stupid, it's asinine, but it's business.

649
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,840
I agree.

650
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,080
That being said, to refer to microtransactions as being an SI unit, hence spouting, is a

651
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,760
microtransaction one millionth of a transaction as equally as asinine?

652
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,520
Well, true, yeah.

653
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,040
Would you say Halo 3 sold three gigacopies?

654
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,760
Okay.

655
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,680
Micro in this sense is not used as a prefix for an actual numerical factor such as centi,

656
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,040
milli, kilo, nano, etc., but more as a description of relative size in contrast with macro.

657
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,320
Refer to the established English terms of macroeconomics and microeconomics, if you

658
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
will.

659
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,760
But no one says microtransactions anyway.

660
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
Why?

661
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,660
Because as the English language is to buzzwords, human being is to a horribly grotesque cross-species

662
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,000
partial abortion, think Minotaur.

663
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,100
It never should have been and should have been put out of its misery, which I'm quite

664
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,840
sure the entirety of Orange Lodge Radio will be quite eager to do after reading this superfluous,

665
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,840
verbose, and...

666
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,640
Thank you, whoever emailed this animator to read these words.

667
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,240
Hey, I have very good pronunciation, thank you.

668
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,280
A mixationally nitpicky email comprised of run-on sentences.

669
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,080
I do have to agree with you there.

670
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,520
It is fairly run-on.

671
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,680
Although actually you are grammatically correct in your last sentence, I have to say.

672
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,200
I shall spare you any further opportunities to become tongue-tied and I wish you all the

673
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
best.

674
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,320
I look forward to each episode as eagerly as the cocaine addict awaits for his next

675
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
hit of snow.

676
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,400
Rubber Buggy Baby Bumpers, D.J.

677
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Dysentery.

678
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
And by the way, you...

679
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,400
By the way...

680
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,960
Okay, he obviously was putting that in just to fuck with you.

681
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,240
By the way, you misspelled cocaine.

682
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,280
The end!

683
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
When did I go back to college English class?

684
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,920
I know, for real.

685
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
This reminds me of fan fiction.

686
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,760
I think someday, like, you know, when...

687
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,680
Wordy and pointless?

688
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,440
Inevitably, this show must end someday and obviously, you know, we don't want it to end

689
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,480
tomorrow, but inevitably we will go our separate ways someday and I totally see Dark Sakura

690
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,920
starting a grammar Nazi podcast.

691
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
There already is one.

692
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Is there really?

693
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
I'm pretty sure there already is one.

694
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
I wouldn't be surprised.

695
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
There's also...

696
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,800
You can find a podcast, no, there is a grammar Nazi podcast because somebody has sent it

697
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
to me.

698
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Where?

699
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
No, I'm not even kidding.

700
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Where can I download it?

701
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,840
I can't remember who did it, but I listened to it about a year and a half ago where they

702
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,000
would receive emails about, you know, different grammatical mistakes and then try to give

703
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,720
you the proper way to say that and certain usages and when it's appropriate to use this

704
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:18,440
spelling or that spelling and I also found one that was all about the differences between

705
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,920
British English and American English.

706
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,680
Where can I get that podcast?

707
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,880
LOL.

708
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
You know what?

709
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,100
You can do what everybody else does and search for it on iTunes.

710
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,100
I don't want to.

711
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,360
I hate that my iPhone is making me use iTunes, though.

712
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Can you continue?

713
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
What?

714
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
We is done.

715
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Oh, no more emails?

716
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,360
We is done.

717
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,100
We is done.

718
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,960
We done good on those emails.

719
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,320
All right, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

720
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,120
Sorry to the people we didn't get to tonight.

721
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
There's just too damn many emails.

722
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
What can we say?

723
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Back to the gaming news.

724
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,080
Anyways, with all these patches and stuff being applied to new games for the PlayStation

725
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,400
3 and games that you might already have on the PlayStation 3, to support the DualShock

726
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,760
3 has gotten a lot of people wondering, hey, maybe I can just import a Japanese DualShock

727
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,140
controller into my non-Japanese country and get to play these games with rumble-tastic

728
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,760
features sooner than everybody else.

729
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Nope.

730
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,080
Because apparently importers like PlayASIA said they've already pre-sold their expected

731
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:30,920
supply and Sony, of course, doesn't support importing stuff, so you will not be able to

732
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,400
probably buy any anytime soon.

733
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:40,480
Because actually importers are charging upwards to $80 per joystick for what you would probably

734
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,440
normally get for $50 and I'm sure that's going to go up.

735
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,220
Of course, new games, they just had a patch for Resistance Fall Man that added rumble.

736
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,060
I know MotorStorm has rumble now.

737
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,880
There was a patch with Ratchet and Clank Future that has rumble.

738
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,720
Just fucking wait.

739
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,640
Why would they have to patch in rumble features?

740
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,440
Because you know the original 6-axis controller had no rumble, because rumble would interfere

741
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,020
with the tilt sensors somehow in this magical world, because you can't actually have tilt

742
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:21,040
and rumble in the same controller, oh wait, no, Nintendo did that, I'm sorry.

743
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,280
Just wait, really, I mean, playing Resistance Fall Man with rumble is not going to make

744
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,280
it like, oh my god, this is the best game ever now.

745
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,200
The only game I really want to play with rumble is Rez, and I would hand off the rumble to

746
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,200
someone else.

747
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
Because you know Rez is on the PS3.

748
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,160
We've all read that article.

749
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,920
Well we have a, I guess, late breaking news thing, I'm going to jump in here with something

750
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,200
that's panning out live while the show is going on.

751
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:59,580
I need like a fanfare or something, or we need something, I don't know.

752
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,580
What do we have?

753
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,040
How about a drum roll with a laptop?

754
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,720
I'm looking for a fanfare noise, hold on, let's see.

755
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Like the little windows?

756
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,760
Oh here we go, yes, we've got it.

757
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:19,880
Now some late breaking news.

758
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,000
Act Deft is practically flooding our chat room with what is going on in the latest Game

759
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,580
Facts Battle.

760
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,980
You know, every damn year they do a character battle, every year.

761
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,640
This is the sixth year of the character battle, and what makes this year different is that

762
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,720
instead of two characters doing battle, it's groups of four, and then two emerge victorious.

763
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,520
Well we are now down to the final four, and typical winners Link and Cloud are in there,

764
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,640
they've both won before.

765
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,280
Solid Snake is also in the top four, but this is the amazing thing, is that this looks to

766
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:00,900
be the very first year that a Final Fantasy character or a Link character will not win

767
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,280
the character battle.

768
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:10,800
That is because with 45 minutes to go, and 33% of the vote, L-Block is winning the character

769
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
battle.

770
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Yay!

771
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:20,200
So NBC News has declared an L-Block victory tonight in the great character battle elections.

772
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,480
Congratulations to the L-Block.

773
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,160
Did I miss something?

774
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Seriously?

775
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,800
Because Tetris is a pone.

776
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,920
Because somehow an L-Block just fucking beat all these other characters, but I think, you

777
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,880
know what though, well deserved, honestly.

778
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,600
Well deserved, because Tetris is one of those games I think people forget, you know, that

779
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,380
is the casual game.

780
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,040
That was the casual game that really opened up the gaming door to a lot of people.

781
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,080
I'm just glad that news had nothing to do with Tingle, so that's, I thought for a second

782
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,920
there they were just going to be like, yeah, Tingle's going to win, and I'm like, fuck.

783
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,920
That's going to suck.

784
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,560
Well I can't wait for that, yeah.

785
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
That'll never happen.

786
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,520
This just in, I Have Judgment sold its millionth copy, hope you get the tights.

787
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,080
There's some interesting things about I Have Judgment too that I heard of.

788
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,760
Do you know how many people have come in to chat tonight and said, one down, 999,999 to

789
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
go.

790
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,520
Our whole contest has become counter productive.

791
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,160
We are driving sales of I Have Judgment.

792
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,520
I heard they have issues.

793
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,080
How so?

794
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,340
I heard they have a subscription.

795
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:26,240
They have similar issues to Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.

796
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,140
Interesting.

797
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,640
Certain integral parts of...

798
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,400
They're not even going to be able to make a million of them.

799
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,000
You goddamn cheater.

800
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,680
Loki fucking cheated in this contest.

801
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,720
He knew they didn't have the parts to make a million of them.

802
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,400
How about I cleanse the pallet?

803
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Asshole.

804
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,440
And didn't I say this was going to happen?

805
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Didn't I tell you?

806
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,040
No, wait, I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't do my actual story.

807
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
I have one question.

808
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,040
Oh, I thought you did.

809
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
No.

810
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,040
Well, fine.

811
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,040
I have to do the Famitsu story real quick.

812
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
Fine, do it.

813
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,200
You're going off on your tangents, confusing me.

814
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
Sorry.

815
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Goddammit.

816
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Chocolate.

817
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,640
Get the bitch some chocolate, Christ almighty.

818
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,600
But I'm not going to eat it.

819
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
Here you go.

820
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,960
And damn it, I accidentally closed the tab that had this story on it, now I can't even

821
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
do it.

822
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,320
Famitsu ran a list of the top 100 games that readers dig, and actually this is kind of

823
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,320
similar to the character battle because I believe all the top games were basically Final

824
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,240
Fantasy games and Zelda games.

825
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,920
I'm trying to bring up the list right now.

826
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,440
Our very own Dark Tetsuya pulled some highlights from the list for us here.

827
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,120
Let's see, at the top of the list, Final Fantasy X, followed by Final Fantasy VII, followed

828
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,440
by Dragon Quest III, followed by Dragon Quest VIII.

829
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,720
So the top four were all Squeenix games.

830
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:48,120
Then we have Machi, followed by Final Fantasy IV, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy III, Dragon

831
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,640
Quest VII, and then Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

832
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,920
So basically half of the top ten were Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games.

833
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,080
And almost all of them are RPGs.

834
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
Fuck that.

835
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
We're done.

836
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
We're that.

837
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Anyway.

838
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,280
Other notable games on the chart, we should point out, Street Fighter II came in at number

839
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
20.

840
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,160
The Super Mario Brothers came in at 21.

841
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,440
Final Fantasy VI was in 25.

842
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,440
The fuck?

843
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,440
VI is like one of the best ones.

844
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,160
But Final Fantasy VII has more fandom-y stuff.

845
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Oh well.

846
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,080
Japan, you screwed that up.

847
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,000
Chrono Trigger, number 28.

848
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,200
Kingdom Hearts II, number 29.

849
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,800
The original Legend of Zelda, 46.

850
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,360
51, Pokemon Red and Green.

851
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,320
And if you want to know where L-Block ended up on the Famitsu list, 96 was where Tetris

852
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,720
Game Boy ended up.

853
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,720
Gradius was on there.

854
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,920
Gradius was 98.

855
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,160
Super Mario Brothers 3 was 99.

856
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,320
I want to know where R-Type is.

857
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,880
Well, you'll just have to pick up this week's Famitsu magazine.

858
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,720
I don't want to go to San Francisco to go buy it.

859
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,720
Okay, you can do your story now.

860
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Okay.

861
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,800
Now again, didn't I say this was going to happen?

862
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,600
And don't get me wrong, I love the technology.

863
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,720
I have one myself built into my PS3.

864
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
I love Blu-Ray.

865
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,240
But I also loved Betamax.

866
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,920
And Betamax was far superior to VHS.

867
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,400
I would also like to point out Dark Sakura has an impressive LaserDisc collection.

868
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,720
I do, because I used to go to anime conventions and they'd sell LaserDisc for five bucks a

869
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,720
piece.

870
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,080
So basically, if Dark Sakura likes your media format, you're fucked.

871
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,480
She probably has a collection of 8-tracks somewhere.

872
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,780
LaserDisc did last for a while.

873
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,840
It was the enthusiast format.

874
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,400
You could saw off someone's head with one of those things, too.

875
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,120
Yeah, they were pretty heavy.

876
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,240
What ever happened to VideoDisc?

877
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
Can you imagine?

878
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,640
We rented Dumbo on VideoDisc once.

879
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,640
I'll never forget it.

880
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,560
Hey, remember this big plastic-coated...

881
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,960
Yeah, they were like LaserDiscs but in a giant plastic tray.

882
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,460
Hey, can you imagine if they had a Blu-Ray that was the size of a LaserDisc?

883
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,080
How much fucking space you can have on there?

884
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,680
Yeah, that's in the next PlayStation 4.

885
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,040
Yo, what the fuck is this giant slot in here for?

886
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,040
Here's the games!

887
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,080
These are all of our releases for the year!

888
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,260
Enjoy.

889
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,960
That would fucking rock.

890
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,680
I hope PlayStation 4 has those large pizza-sized discs.

891
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,640
I want my next system to be the size of three Atari 5200s.

892
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,640
The end.

893
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,120
I want to weigh as much as ten Xboxes.

894
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,760
I want to have to get a dolly to put this thing in my house.

895
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,760
You know the Xbox is larger than an Atari 5200, but not wider.

896
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,480
Tangent, what were you going to say about Blu-Ray?

897
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,480
Kmart's not selling them anymore, so anyone...

898
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:42,280
Whatever, you know, no one really shops at Kmart.

899
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,840
I didn't know Kmart was still around.

900
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,480
I love the personal opinion that gets interjected in this show.

901
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
Okay, I take that back.

902
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
Here's tonight's news.

903
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,760
Kmart pulled Blu-Ray, whatever, no one shops at Kmart.

904
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,840
I take that back.

905
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:02,480
I did buy pillows at Kmart because they were on sale, and I bought my sheets for my massage

906
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,160
at Kmart, but other than that, no one shops at Kmart.

907
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,140
Okay, I don't know if Kmart's exactly the demographic for Blu-Ray.

908
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,280
That's exactly what I'm saying.

909
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,420
Who thinks, gee, I'm going to go get a Blu-Ray player, where can I get a really good top-of-line

910
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,480
Blu-Ray player that's, I'm going to go to Kmart?

911
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,720
Well, keep in mind, even though Kmart did declare bankruptcy, they did go back and buy

912
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,280
Sears, so...

913
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,760
Okay, if I want an Icee, I'll go to Kmart.

914
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,040
I go there to buy sheets from my massage table, and that's about it.

915
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,880
Or if, heaven forbid, I want something from the Martha Stewart collection, I'll go to

916
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,880
Kmart.

917
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,880
My pillows.

918
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,240
Or if I want to go laugh at the poor people.

919
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,280
Just kidding.

920
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,280
I'm among you.

921
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,780
And Rama is yelling in chat, hey, damn it.

922
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,200
I shop at Kmart.

923
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,980
Raven's Dolphin says, shit, I shop at Kmart.

924
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:55,040
Much like I go back to the conversation we had in part A, where I said, LARPing, something

925
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,000
you don't really want to admit to.

926
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
You know what?

927
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,680
Here's the reason why I don't, okay, here's the reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore,

928
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,680
even though this isn't supposed to be an Instagram podcast.

929
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,680
Dude, they have little Caesars.

930
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,680
Okay.

931
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,680
That's why I shop at Kmart.

932
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:15,920
Actually, I do also sometimes buy my DVR discs for my camera.

933
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,320
Okay, here's the thing.

934
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,680
I used to, my fondest memories of going to Kmart, going shopping were in the 80s.

935
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,800
Like we used to go, you know, it'd be like a big department store trip day, we're going

936
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
to go to Kmart.

937
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
Here's the problem.

938
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,040
There's a reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore, because the store hasn't fucking

939
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,840
changed a thing since the 80s, besides what's on the shelves.

940
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,520
No, not even the clothes.

941
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
Except.

942
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,520
Yes.

943
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,720
I did find a cute sweater there, but it also was like one of those 80s revival styles.

944
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,080
I think I saw some underwear for sale that was actually from the 80s.

945
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,620
I bought socks.

946
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:54,000
You can buy socks at Kmart, because socks, you know, are socks.

947
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,440
I think they actually still have those doors that you have to like step on the mat where

948
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,680
it triggers the door before infrared technology or something like that.

949
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,080
Okay, can we move on before we get the hate mail from Kmart?

950
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,880
Okay, they're not carrying Blu-ray players anymore, so whatever.

951
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,520
Yeah, the hate mail from that one Kmart person.

952
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,520
Okay.

953
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:17,800
Anyways, here's some exciting news, and I'm going to say this is very specific.

954
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,080
It has nothing to do with Kmart.

955
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,840
It has nothing to do with Kmart.

956
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,320
LucasArts and Bioware are teaming up for something.

957
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,360
Yes, that's right.

958
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,340
They're working on an undisclosed interactive entertainment product.

959
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,440
But it's LucasArts and Bioware, so what else do we know?

960
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
It's going to be awesome.

961
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,600
It's going to be like Knights of the Old Republic or something like that.

962
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,000
It's Knights of the Old Indiana Jones Republic, that's right.

963
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,680
I feel the need to say something nice about Kmart now.

964
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,480
They do carry the Diet Cranberry Serumist.

965
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,200
I will pre-order the LucasArts Bioware game at Kmart, no I won't.

966
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,840
But I will tell you one thing that Kmart is good for.

967
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:04,800
They don't care about street dates because that's where I got Serenity like two weeks

968
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,160
before it came out and I got it as an early Christmas gift for Xtrafer and he was all

969
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,560
excited because he had Serenity on DVD for any of his friends.

970
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,600
I'm sorry, LucasArts?

971
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,600
They're making something.

972
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Okay.

973
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
Hooray!

974
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:24,160
Rumors, rumors, rumors, and this rumor has something to do with Oblivion, that's right,

975
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,800
The Elder Scrolls Oblivion, the game that just won't stay out in the news.

976
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:33,360
This game has been making headlines since it came out and now it should be noted that

977
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:38,800
the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, that's ZeniMax Media, has registered the domain

978
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,800
name Elderscrollsonline.com.

979
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,800
Oh my God!

980
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,260
A website.

981
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:50,360
Could this mean that Elder Scrolls Oblivion could make its way online, be an MMO?

982
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,040
Hell, somebody already hacked the game to do this on the PC version.

983
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,640
Could this be a further way to milk the Oblivion franchise?

984
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,640
Who knows?

985
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,360
It could give World of Warcraft a run for their money.

986
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,360
Puppy, how many hours have you spent on Oblivion?

987
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,360
A lot.

988
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,360
A lot.

989
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,360
Let's leave a lot, right?

990
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,280
A lot in a two week span of time, yes.

991
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,840
So what would you think of this?

992
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,880
If there was an Oblivion online, would you play it or is this jumping the shark?

993
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
I don't know.

994
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,720
It would, with as much, you'll play it, characterization and customization there is, I don't know.

995
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:25,180
They would have to do a lot to expand the world because running around in the worlds

996
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:30,640
in Oblivion, it's like running, running, running, running, tree, rock, tree, rock, oh look a

997
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,280
rabbit run, run, run, run, run, run, oh look, hey look, a dungeon, we're going to be punching

998
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:41,240
horses online, in the face, a sheep tossing contest would be fun, good times.

999
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,560
Yeah, but you know what it doesn't have?

1000
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,300
You can't kick bugs in the face.

1001
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,880
You can kick sheep in the face, probably.

1002
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,880
They're big enough to kick.

1003
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,680
You can't kick bees in the face.

1004
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,880
You can't, Aragorondo.

1005
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,280
Sorry, I'm looking at chat right now.

1006
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,560
I got to go back to the Kmart thing because this shit's funny.

1007
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:10,920
SSJ100Matt in chat says, Kmart still sells Rockus Dukakis shirts.

1008
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,000
Hilarity.

1009
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,640
Robwood2B says, I go to Kmart to trip over stuff in the aisles.

1010
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,880
Blue Light Special.

1011
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,880
Okay, anyway, sorry.

1012
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,040
Okay, so Elder Scrolls may be online, at least if recent domain names are to be believed.

1013
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:38,360
Skypline is opening soon, you can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our user name on Skype

1014
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,720
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1015
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,320
We have a couple more stories before we get there, right Jamie?

1016
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,040
Yes, if someone would stop hogging the mic, puppy.

1017
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:55,440
You know, you're no longer a foreign correspondent, you live in my town now.

1018
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,480
You can be our resident puppy.

1019
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,040
Video game story.

1020
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,040
Hey Rob, guess what?

1021
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,040
What?

1022
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Kmart.

1023
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,160
Okay, so Namco Bandai, dun dun dun.

1024
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,940
I agree with Misty, why would you want to kick a bee in the face anyway?

1025
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,520
Just because it's the act of kicking a bee in the face.

1026
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:21,240
Oh, well shit, I'm so sorry.

1027
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,240
Just because it's the novelty.

1028
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,720
How dare I?

1029
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:26,720
What?

1030
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,120
I don't know, Loki, you're just like, you're looking patient over there like, I want this

1031
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,120
show to finish.

1032
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,400
No, he's watching that video again.

1033
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,040
I'm not watching that video again.

1034
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,040
Okay.

1035
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,040
Namco Bandai.

1036
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Yes, Namco Bandai.

1037
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:47,720
I have announced a Wii exclusive, Soul Calibur Legends, which is very, very happy.

1038
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,760
We will have everybody so far, hopefully new people.

1039
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,040
Wait, I think we're getting some late breaking news, Rob.

1040
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,040
Oh yes, oh sorry.

1041
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,040
Late breaking news.

1042
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:06,440
I'm sorry, here's...

1043
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,440
We go to our correspondent, Loki, live in the OLR studio with late breaking news.

1044
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Yes, apparently the reaction to Soul Calibur Legends going gold is, what could he do?

1045
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,000
Who gives a fuck?

1046
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,360
It's going to be crappy anyways.

1047
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:26,720
Hey, did anyone remember, what was that, that stupid game with, it's like a spinoff of Tekken?

1048
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,920
God, I've blocked it from my brain, but...

1049
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,760
Oh, the one that had Nina, it starred Nina, didn't it?

1050
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,760
Yeah.

1051
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
Yeah.

1052
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
Yeah, Death by Degrees.

1053
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,760
Thank you.

1054
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,760
Death by Degrees.

1055
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,760
Yeah, yeah.

1056
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,760
That's this game all over again.

1057
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,760
Yeah.

1058
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,240
Ivy, Death by Degrees.

1059
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,240
No.

1060
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,240
But will she have the whip?

1061
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,240
That's all we need to know.

1062
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,560
I actually kind of wanted Death by Degrees just because of me being a big Tekken nerd.

1063
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,720
I even have this, okay, I even have the dumb Tekken game that was on Wonderswan.

1064
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,640
That's pretty sad.

1065
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,640
It was like Tekken Kart.

1066
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,800
That's like buying Tekken on your cell phone.

1067
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
Alright.

1068
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,560
Does it come on cell phone?

1069
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,840
Quick, another story, then the Skype line.

1070
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,640
Anyways, um, yes.

1071
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:19,820
So this totally, I don't know, perpetuates all those stereotypes of Halo 3 players.

1072
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:26,480
Apparently a child assaulted his mother and attacked the police because he was ordered

1073
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,120
to stop playing Halo 3, which right there, you had it coming.

1074
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,040
I mean, seriously, you're making your child play a mature rated game, or I should say

1075
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,000
you're allowing your child to play a mature rated game.

1076
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Um, the trouble began when the youth was told by his mother to turn off his Xbox 360 as

1077
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,520
it was getting late.

1078
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,520
After he refused, his mother took his AirCard, which is apparently an adapter you can use

1079
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:57,040
for your cell phone to get Wi-Fi, from the 360, preventing him from playing online and

1080
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,800
prompting a fit of rage that would see the child frantically search through the house

1081
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,540
before punching his mom in the face.

1082
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:10,880
The kid then retreated to his room, but soon had to deal with the local sheriff deputies

1083
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,480
who his mom had called following the assault.

1084
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,880
Deputies entered his room using a key kept by the mother, but also fell foul to the youth's

1085
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
rage.

1086
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,460
He managed to punch one of the deputies square in the face, which then he was restrained

1087
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,460
and handcuffed.

1088
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,480
He would later be turned over to the state juvenile authorities of charges of battery

1089
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,560
hunting domestic violence and battery on a law enforcement officer.

1090
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:43,520
God, kids these days.

1091
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,200
Kids do the darndest things.

1092
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:52,160
But now I can just imagine people on Halo yelling, oh you stupid mother puncher!

1093
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:57,720
Well dude this is stupid anyways, I mean your fucking kid is like playing Halo and it's

1094
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,160
a mature rated game.

1095
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,520
Oh my god, it must be the violence of the game that caused him to punch his mom in the

1096
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,520
face.

1097
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:10,000
What I really want to know is what have they been doing to their child up to that point

1098
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,440
that they would have a violent reaction or maybe their child already had psychological

1099
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,440
problems.

1100
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,440
You know.

1101
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,440
Took them to Kmart.

1102
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,120
Here's our new O.L.R. in joke.

1103
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
We have Kmart.

1104
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,120
Hey Timmy, it's Disneyland.

1105
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,840
This is Kmart.

1106
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,840
No it's Disneyland.

1107
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Kmart.

1108
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,840
No Disneyland.

1109
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,840
Go play.

1110
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:41,320
But it seems to me that there had to have been a pre-existing problem for their child

1111
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:47,560
to react that way because I have seen children play Halo 3 and been just fine and not want

1112
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:52,040
to punch anybody when their parents said, okay we can't play on Dan's Xbox anymore.

1113
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:58,720
But mom, I was fragging some fucking noobs.

1114
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:07,040
You know, Dan's little, his cousin's kid comes over and plays games at our house sometimes.

1115
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,120
And has he ever punched you in the face?

1116
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,720
No.

1117
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,640
He's always been well behaved.

1118
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,620
That's because his parents teach him right.

1119
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,800
I think it's a fault with the parents but I do think it's good that she did call, you

1120
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:25,560
know, have him actually, you know, stand accountable for what he did.

1121
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,160
Shadow Charlie asks, how old was this kid?

1122
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,800
The age and name were withheld.

1123
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,600
I heard he was just 15 or something like that.

1124
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,640
I heard, you suck.

1125
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,560
Oh, your mom.

1126
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,520
It was some Florida kid.

1127
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,080
Indian River County website.

1128
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,360
They have a website for Indian River County for Florida.

1129
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,640
Where to stay, where to dine, what to do.

1130
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,640
Discover our lifestyle choices including dying with pictures of old people on a golf course

1131
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,320
and on a beach and in a dining room.

1132
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,320
Dying.

1133
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,320
Sorry.

1134
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,320
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

1135
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,280
All right, let's open up the Skype line.

1136
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,480
If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype.

1137
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:23,680
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio and you can comment on any of tonight's stories or you can make

1138
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,680
a Kmart joke.

1139
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,680
I don't really care.

1140
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,720
Tonight, after tonight's show, I'm like crying from laughing so hard.

1141
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,720
It's not that funny.

1142
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,640
I know I'm going to be listening to this show like in the car later so I'm going to go,

1143
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,760
this show really wasn't that funny.

1144
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,960
Why were you laughing so much?

1145
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,760
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1146
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,320
It's the Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.

1147
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,000
Hi, Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.

1148
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,280
Did you just get back from Kmart?

1149
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,920
Yes, I just got back from Kmart and guess what, there is no blue-way players.

1150
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,480
All right, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

1151
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,480
Mario Galaxy.

1152
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,480
That's what's on my mind.

1153
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,560
Ah, yes, you are Mr. Gay is Mario Galaxy.

1154
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,640
I know, but let's not go there.

1155
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,680
All right, what about Mario Galaxy?

1156
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:07,360
Did you realize that the, I know Jamie said that she's getting a retail copy at her store

1157
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:11,320
so I actually got the chance to play it at a GameStop.

1158
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,360
And what did you think, young man?

1159
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,680
I think the game looked great.

1160
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,920
I love the controls.

1161
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,040
I think the game just looked great.

1162
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:24,640
I mean, well, the game was on HGTV so it left a lot to be desired, which was a little sad,

1163
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,160
a little sad about that, but the controls were great.

1164
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,120
Everything was great about it.

1165
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,280
Is this a game the kids across the country are going to be craving come this Christmas

1166
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,280
season?

1167
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,880
Craving, they're going to be dying for it.

1168
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,200
You're going to be shooting each other like they were PS3s?

1169
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
I don't know.

1170
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,040
Well, I mean, you know, if you want to get the game, just never mind.

1171
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,720
I was going to make a joke, but I'm beating that joke on the ground.

1172
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,720
So Super Mario Galaxy, so awesome.

1173
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,120
You'll punch your mother in the face just to play some more.

1174
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,120
Is it?

1175
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,120
Yeah.

1176
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,120
Is the game that great?

1177
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,120
Is it worth punching your mom in the face over?

1178
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,880
I think so.

1179
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,560
Let's go ahead and call his mom so that we know to hide what your child is saying.

1180
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,160
All right.

1181
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,280
What else did you call in to tell us about Ravenstaufen?

1182
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,840
You just wanted to say that Mario Galaxy is cool?

1183
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,320
Mario Galaxy and Phoenix, sorry, Charles and Turb about is very good.

1184
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,320
Music's phenomenal.

1185
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:27,880
You know Shane, who used to guest on this show a lot before he moved back to Kansas?

1186
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,640
We have a Ventrilo server for World of Warcraft slash Final Fantasy XI, basically.

1187
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,400
Be careful on those.

1188
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,400
Yeah.

1189
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,400
No, I want Ventrilo harassment guy to sign on to our Ventrilo.

1190
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,080
I'm like, roll out the fucking red carpet for him.

1191
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,960
I think that guy's fucking hilarious.

1192
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,720
But anyway, I would be so honored if he came on and I'd be like, yay, it's Ventrilo harassment

1193
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,720
guy.

1194
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:54,280
Anyway, the thing about Shane though is that he has been signing on to Ventrilo this week

1195
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,560
and we're like, Shane, where are you?

1196
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,840
You're not in WoW and you're not playing Final Fantasy XI either.

1197
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,560
He's like, oh, I'm playing Phoenix, right?

1198
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,560
Right.

1199
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,640
We're like, why are you signed on to Vent?

1200
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,640
He's like, I don't know.

1201
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,960
I just, you know, I'm playing Phoenix, right?

1202
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,960
I just thought I'd say hello.

1203
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,560
It's like, okay, I got to go.

1204
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,560
I got a case.

1205
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:10,560
You know what I need to do?

1206
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,560
What?

1207
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,320
I need to play Guild Wars and Ragnarok at the same time.

1208
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,320
At the same time?

1209
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,320
At the same time.

1210
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,320
That'd be pretty hardcore.

1211
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,320
All right.

1212
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,320
One more thing.

1213
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,840
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Ravensdolvin?

1214
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,840
One more, one more.

1215
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,440
You were talking about Count Ducula and all those good shows that's coming back.

1216
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,440
Fuck yeah, we were.

1217
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,960
I would love to see a Count Ducula show.

1218
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:34,000
I mean, you know, we've been doing, I've been doing this experimental podcast called the

1219
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Cartoon Cast.

1220
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,680
So we've been talking about Count Ducula and showing old cartoons like that.

1221
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,400
So I would love to see a Count Ducula game.

1222
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,400
Who wouldn't?

1223
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
Me.

1224
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,400
This is my favorite part.

1225
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,840
I would not like to see a Count Ducula game.

1226
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,960
Why?

1227
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,480
Because the show's been off the air for years.

1228
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,960
Okay, so Dragon Ball Z's been off the air for years.

1229
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,500
Why are we still getting games?

1230
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,500
Because Atari, that's all it got.

1231
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,500
Well, you know what?

1232
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,680
They probably still show episodes of it on the Kmart TVs.

1233
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,680
Okay?

1234
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:07,920
Look, I've seen episodes of Count Ducula on TV a while back, but that's what the internet's

1235
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:08,920
for, right?

1236
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,920
Exactly.

1237
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,920
That and porn.

1238
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,920
We've got YouTube.

1239
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,920
All right.

1240
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:13,920
That's amazing.

1241
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,920
Is that it then, Ravenstaufen?

1242
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,920
That is it.

1243
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:16,920
Thank you for taking my call.

1244
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:17,920
You are most welcome, sir.

1245
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,920
Have a great week.

1246
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,920
All right.

1247
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,920
Wow, he hung up on himself.

1248
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,280
I didn't even click the button.

1249
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,560
If you want to give us a call or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, or our phone

1250
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:31,240
number 1-877-GAME-OLR, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1251
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,240
Who's this?

1252
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,080
Oh, it's truly Legend of Zaku.

1253
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,400
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1254
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,400
What's on your mind?

1255
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,400
Um, nothing.

1256
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,320
Don't mind me for the fact that this girl just helped me a short while ago.

1257
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,480
I'm sorry to hear that.

1258
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,480
I am.

1259
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,200
But yeah, I guess, you know- Whiskey makes it all better.

1260
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
Jamie.

1261
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,200
What?

1262
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:57,880
Manhunt 2, you know, that whole controversy, that whole clusterfuck that rocks our man

1263
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
to shove some beer.

1264
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,880
Okay, seriously?

1265
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,880
I got to stop you right here, okay?

1266
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,180
After breaking up with your girlfriend, I would not recommend playing Manhunt 2.

1267
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,320
That's going to give you a totally bad idea.

1268
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,960
I'm not going to, I'm not homicidal, all right?

1269
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,200
I've played Doom since I was like, what, 11?

1270
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,160
So yeah, I guess, I don't know, I don't get why, you know, why companies like Rockstar

1271
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:25,200
just, you know, they try to half-ass their way by just covering up stuff, you know, covering

1272
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,800
up, you know, bits that were thrown back when the ASRP told them to, and all of a sudden,

1273
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:37,880
you know, hackers find a way to make us gamers look bad, to make the industry look bad.

1274
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,000
You know, and it was just, honestly, when they said, oh, we're going to mask this stuff,

1275
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,800
that was just an open invite to the hackers to say, find out how we mask this and unmask

1276
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,800
it.

1277
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,760
I mean, I know, I know, you know, I can understand that, you know, that the rating, you know,

1278
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,120
the rating board actually, you know, knew about the content that was blurred out.

1279
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:02,480
But wouldn't it make more sense not to, you know, not to give, not to give ammunition

1280
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,920
to, you know, to the critics, to anyone who's out to get people like Rockstar for the fact

1281
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,960
that they get called out on stuff that was, you know, that was supposedly rejected before

1282
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:19,280
but it's still in the game, just not seen, kind of like the whole hot coffee thing where,

1283
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,520
you know, it still shouldn't, you know, still shouldn't have been on the disk in the first

1284
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,520
place.

1285
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:30,920
And they should have learned, not hiding, not obscuring it from, you know, from the

1286
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:37,400
ratings board, not doing that, but just not having the common sense to not keep, you know,

1287
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,480
to keep it out of the disk in the first place.

1288
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,680
I don't, you know, so be it, you have to recreate the build but, you know, and that shit happens

1289
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,640
in our job.

1290
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,200
You know what just occurred to me because we were talking about Oblivion a little bit

1291
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,720
ago?

1292
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,800
This is very strange.

1293
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,520
It just occurred to me.

1294
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:01,540
Did they not make Bethesda go back and re-rate Oblivion because somebody found a way to hack

1295
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:04,800
the game so that the girl's top could come off and you could have boobies?

1296
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,960
But you also have to understand.

1297
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,600
Isn't this the same fucking thing?

1298
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:17,840
You also have to understand that we don't know whether or not that company submitted

1299
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:23,680
all the assets for the characters for the ratings board.

1300
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,920
Okay yeah yeah yeah but hold on I just had an epiphany with this whole thing.

1301
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:27,920
I mean totally.

1302
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,920
Wait a minute.

1303
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,920
I just owned ESRB.

1304
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,280
No no no no you didn't and here's why.

1305
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,720
It's because that was on the PC that they did the mod.

1306
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:42,520
The mods on PC's are fairly available whereas a PSP version the hack it means you have to

1307
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,440
have an illegitimate copy of the game.

1308
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,200
But still it's on principle.

1309
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,040
What a fucking great line we are walking.

1310
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,760
It shouldn't have been on the dead score on the actual game.

1311
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,280
It's fucking boobies too.

1312
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,560
I think they should have just taken the AO rating.

1313
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,520
Honestly I think the problem is is that the AO rating is the kiss of death.

1314
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,520
It's the same problem.

1315
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,440
No the problem is that the AO rating means that your game does not get published for

1316
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,240
the PlayStation 2, the Wii, or the PSP.

1317
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,240
And that's the problem.

1318
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,240
That's the problem.

1319
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:16,040
You only get limited to one platform and but that's the other thing you have to understand

1320
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,520
is that legislators right now they want to push bills that will add more you know quote

1321
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:27,060
unquote truth in the ratings basically trying to you know find a way you know to call people

1322
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,960
out for mods even though you know even if it wasn't there wasn't you know the responsibility

1323
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:39,280
of the game the publisher I mean of the designer itself just for the fact that you know it

1324
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:45,720
shouldn't it shouldn't give people shouldn't give hackers or any folks like that the tools

1325
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,800
to create that much controversy to give them a channel.

1326
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:54,380
All right I'm going to agree with Fursby in our chat room on that who says it's just fucking

1327
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,000
pixels and I agree.

1328
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,760
It's pixels but then it's something that the human you know the human brain could translate

1329
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,760
as boobs.

1330
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,960
Well let's also realize that the legislators making these decisions and trying to get all

1331
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,280
this stuff done they're like generations behind us.

1332
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:18,320
Yeah they're only they're only outscored political points you know the bill bills fake DDP Dan

1333
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,960
that's it all they care about is keeping their seat.

1334
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,880
Yeah once they die off and go away we'll get some smarter people in there and we're thinking

1335
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:25,880
better.

1336
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,880
All right.

1337
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,120
But then we're going to run into the same complaints.

1338
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,260
Zaku I gotta let you go because we're going on five minutes of this call we gotta get

1339
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,080
some more calls but thank you for your perspective.

1340
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,480
We appreciate it as always and sorry to hear about the girl there's plenty of fish in the

1341
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:40,480
sea Zaku.

1342
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,480
I'm right.

1343
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,480
You'll find one.

1344
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,480
All right.

1345
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:48,160
If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on skype orange launch radio hi

1346
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,760
you're on orange launch radio who's this?

1347
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,960
Hey this is Rob with two B's.

1348
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,880
Wow Rob with two B's how you doing sir?

1349
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,840
Yeah I'm doing fine I just decided to call in because it was too long to write in chat.

1350
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,520
I was going to say I think we hear from you a lot on email and totally appreciate it but

1351
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,160
I think this might be the first time I can recall you calling into the show.

1352
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,080
It is the first time.

1353
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:14,440
Well congratulations on making the great crossover from the written form to the verbal form.

1354
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,440
It's good to hear from you.

1355
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,800
What's on your mind?

1356
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,400
VG Expo was this weekend.

1357
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:27,160
That's right the America's VG Expo in Philly and didn't they actually got Jack Thompson

1358
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,560
to go to their show didn't they?

1359
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,120
They did and from what I've heard it was civil which is surprising.

1360
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:33,120
Interesting.

1361
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,280
Sorry I just said the forbidden phrase on the show my bad.

1362
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,240
Especially since the man is near rabid.

1363
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:41,040
Anyway what you want to say about America's VG Expo did you go Rob?

1364
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:47,600
Yeah I went on Saturday it really is only worth a day trip if you live in the area.

1365
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:53,200
It was in Philadelphia Convention Center which is downtown about 10 minutes from the airport

1366
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,680
and I hate to admit it but it was a better location.

1367
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:06,440
They had the Rock Band Tour, they had the Dell Intel Hi-Def Tour, I'm trying to remember

1368
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:14,160
they had a few contests on Guitar Hero and alright that's all I can remember.

1369
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,160
Sounds like there was a lot to see.

1370
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,480
It sounds like it was E for All.

1371
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:24,360
No I didn't go to E for All but you get done with things fast there.

1372
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:31,800
Plus they didn't have much on the forums or anything.

1373
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:38,840
Basically on the day I was there they had the journalists forum, they had the moral

1374
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:46,040
combat movie, they had their Jack Thompson panel and they had something I skipped the

1375
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,600
Postal 2 preview.

1376
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Sounds skippable.

1377
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,280
I want to make it short so anybody who didn't go can understand what went on.

1378
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,920
The Game Journalist Interviews is always a good one and nobody goes to it.

1379
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,060
Gosh I can't remember the names of the people.

1380
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,440
What kind of game journalists were they?

1381
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,880
Were they independent folks like us that do podcasting or were we talking folks from Game

1382
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,520
Spot, One Up type people?

1383
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:20,640
Yes we had one from One Up, one from Game Stop, not Game Stop, EGM I'm sorry the original

1384
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:27,000
editor of EGM when it was spelled out.

1385
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,320
They had the director of marketing for Ziff Davis and he was really informative.

1386
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,560
To make a long story short the best thing he said was if you want to be a game journalist

1387
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:47,480
you should, he said this because it's in their own company, you should blog on One Up and

1388
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:52,680
make reviews less than 90 words.

1389
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,680
Wait

1390
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,680
That's the best way to get noticed.

1391
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:59,680
If you want to be a game journalist you should get reviews that are less than 90 words?

1392
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,680
Yes

1393
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:05,080
You're as sure as sucks.

1394
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:12,960
It takes at least 10 more words to get your mom on mother of the year nominations.

1395
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,680
Really really really really really really really really sucks.

1396
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,880
Okay here we go here we go.

1397
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:24,800
No I got it, Yaris, at least it's not ET on the Atari 2600.

1398
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,440
Yeah we can't actually bury it.

1399
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:33,680
Okay here we go here we go, Yaris, sucks, would rather have gone to Kmart.

1400
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:40,920
The sound you hear is a dead horse being beaten over and over again in the studio.

1401
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,960
Okay well the the Mortal Kombat movie is very good it could make you motion sick because

1402
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:53,000
they have a really long quake sequence in there and it's a lot of video game graphics

1403
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,960
running in the background while the interviews are going on.

1404
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:00,720
It's actually in my opinion is too much video game graphics but they do some really funny

1405
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:04,960
transitions so it's worth a it's worth a listen.

1406
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,800
It leaves the gray area gray.

1407
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:16,360
And then the Jack Thompson and the guy he was sparring against was Lorne Lanning of

1408
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:24,520
who helped to co-created Oddworld Inhabitants and they were they were sparring off and Jack

1409
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:31,080
was funny and he was civil and you know I really hate you know I don't have any dirt

1410
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,440
on him he was he was very smart.

1411
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,800
Well he knew he was in enemy territory I mean you know yeah he probably went back onto the

1412
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,960
game politics put comment forums a couple hours later and started slandering.

1413
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,280
They all smelled like ass.

1414
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:51,640
I know his comments on game politics are really like personality too.

1415
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:56,000
Well Rob we can oh yeah go ahead oh Lorne pretty much lost the interview because he

1416
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,160
got emotional and he and he started attacking Jackie Pooh's character which was really a

1417
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,960
mistake and you know it doesn't matter who won it doesn't change my opinion.

1418
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,680
I agree it's just one debate he may have won the battle but he hasn't won the war.

1419
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:18,120
And you should have seen they made us go through the security check.

1420
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,120
Good times.

1421
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:23,080
Well Rob we got to let you go but we we really appreciate the call talking about the VG Expo

1422
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:27,120
which we all forgot happened so I'm glad somebody was there to remind us all righty.

1423
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,560
Well I only live like 90 minutes from it so.

1424
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:33,040
Nice well glad to hear you had a good time and hope to hear from you in the future don't

1425
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,040
be a stranger.

1426
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,040
All right see ya.

1427
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,040
Take care buddy.

1428
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,040
Thanks.

1429
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,000
I feel bad because I'm making our callers wrap it up but you know we got I know there's

1430
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:47,080
still a bunch of people that want to call in so we'll take maybe two more calls 1-877-GAME-OLR

1431
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:55,760
or our username on skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call.

1432
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,080
I will open it up for some oh never mind we're getting a call.

1433
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:04,520
Hi on orange launch radio who's this?

1434
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,920
Hi you are on orange launch radio who's this?

1435
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,920
We cannot hear you.

1436
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,920
Hola bienvenidos a orange launch radio.

1437
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,920
Quienes.

1438
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,560
Did you say Guiness?

1439
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:24,040
What the crap is hi hi hi were you not expecting to get through?

1440
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,880
No I didn't plug my mic in.

1441
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,040
Oh well good job DMN.

1442
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,080
Well hi DMN what's on your mind now that we can actually hear you?

1443
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:38,800
I am actually calling in response to one of the long emails dark sakura or soccer sorry

1444
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,760
had about Nintendo and ignorance and the Nintendo 64.

1445
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,960
Goody goody what do you have to say?

1446
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:52,000
Do any of you have any idea as to why Nintendo is still around?

1447
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,040
Mario no handheld.

1448
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:01,920
Because of their involvement still in the Hanafuda card business.

1449
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:07,080
That's exactly it Jamie no Pokemon.

1450
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:13,600
That game has sold well over 14 to 15 million copies and that's just the originals alone.

1451
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,920
That's the reason why Nintendo is still in business.

1452
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:21,660
Had that game not have sold on America's Nintendo would be kaput.

1453
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:28,800
So the Nintendo 64 tanked let's all admit that it tanked it wasn't that great a system.

1454
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,240
Nintendo lost a lot of money on it and they didn't do that great on the gamecube either.

1455
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:37,600
They're just now rebounding back with the DS and the Wii.

1456
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:44,560
So saying that you know the Nintendo 64 kept it in their forum no.

1457
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,560
Did it have games I personally enjoyed yes but I don't think it was that successful of

1458
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:50,560
a system.

1459
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,000
We threw two bees our last caller's back in chat and says Nintendo sells at profit that's

1460
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,800
why they're still around.

1461
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:01,440
That too I mean the gamecube from its inception sold profit the Wii since its inception has

1462
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:08,600
sold at profit the DS even if both models have sold at profit.

1463
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:13,720
So Nintendo has knows what they're doing with hardware that's why they're still in it.

1464
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:20,320
And like I said earlier Pokemon snap is the shit so you know Pokemon for the win.

1465
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:26,240
Alright any other thoughts for our listeners tonight DMN?

1466
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:32,680
Oh man oh Guitar Hero 3 massively multiplayer thon that I talked about on my show I want

1467
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,040
to pitch that really quick.

1468
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,040
What's this?

1469
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:41,600
If you are an OLR fanboy listener on air talent get together on Xbox live or on a Nintendo

1470
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:48,160
Wi-Fi connection this Saturday I believe it's November the 9th and get together play with

1471
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:53,320
some fellow OLR listeners and have some fun because Guitar Hero 3 is a very fun game especially

1472
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,660
on multiplayer this time around.

1473
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:57,560
Or you could join our band on the website.

1474
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,120
That too I did I joined it like just now.

1475
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:05,560
Oh I see your request I'm going to go in and approve it right now.

1476
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,920
I'm working on that right now as we talk.

1477
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,000
He's clicking on the red x-rays.

1478
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I am.

1479
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,040
Okay and now I'm going to click on the button that hangs up on you okay?

1480
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,040
Okay.

1481
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,840
Bye friend!

1482
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,280
Alright let's get some last minute stories.

1483
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:22,000
What's going on over to Loki with any last minute stories?

1484
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,920
Oh Dark Sakura has one why don't you start us off then?

1485
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,920
I do have one.

1486
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:31,640
Do you remember how they were talking about the PS3 to help with the folding protein models?

1487
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:37,640
Actually it did make the Guinness Book of World Records and they're saying that since

1488
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:48,320
the project started they've been using 670,000 PlayStation 3s at they were actually according

1489
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:55,240
to this it says the FAH is now the most powerful distributed computing network ever at over

1490
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:56,240
a petaflop.

1491
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:01,800
That sounds like something that would be on Dateline NBC a petaflop.

1492
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,080
It's over 250 teraflops which is a trillion calculations per second.

1493
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:14,440
So, they have been using the PS3 as a computer and the whole point of the folding project

1494
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:21,400
is basically to look how proteins fold because they have evidence to show that proteins that

1495
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:27,280
don't fold properly are related to Alzheimer's and other diseases.

1496
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,120
The amazing things being accomplished with the PlayStation 3 what can we say?

1497
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:36,120
And Rob with Two Bees asks in chat what's a microflop then?

1498
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,360
That would be this episode.

1499
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,400
Good point.

1500
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,960
We're getting another call on the Skype line.

1501
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:43,960
Let's go take it.

1502
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:44,960
Hello.

1503
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,960
You are on Orange Lawn's radio.

1504
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,960
Who's this?

1505
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,960
Hello.

1506
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:48,960
It's Rice Princess.

1507
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,960
Hi Rice Princess.

1508
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,960
You're not here.

1509
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:51,960
You're supposed to be here in studio tonight.

1510
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:52,960
I totally was.

1511
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:53,960
I'm sorry.

1512
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,960
What gives?

1513
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:55,960
I have a flat tire.

1514
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:56,960
Fired.

1515
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,960
I know.

1516
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:58,960
I'm sorry.

1517
01:20:58,960 --> 01:20:59,960
Too cute.

1518
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:00,960
All right.

1519
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,120
Well, what's on your mind and put the mic a little closer to your mouth because you're

1520
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,120
barely coming in.

1521
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,120
This better.

1522
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,120
Oh my gosh.

1523
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,120
Is it louder?

1524
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,120
Jesus Christ.

1525
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,120
Yes.

1526
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,120
All right.

1527
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,120
Okay.

1528
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,120
Much better.

1529
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,120
What's on your mind?

1530
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,120
What do you want to comment on tonight?

1531
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,120
Oh, I don't know.

1532
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,120
You told me to call in.

1533
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,840
I told you to call in because you weren't here in person.

1534
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,920
I just wanted to break you over the phone.

1535
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,920
Oh, okay.

1536
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,920
Shame on you.

1537
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,280
Well, what have you been playing lately?

1538
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,280
Anything?

1539
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:32,640
I haven't been doing much game playing for the past couple of weeks.

1540
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,560
You haven't been playing a lot of WoW or anything?

1541
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,560
Not really.

1542
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,560
Oh.

1543
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,560
Well, gee.

1544
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,480
A video game podcaster does you a lot of good this week, doesn't it?

1545
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,480
Doesn't it though?

1546
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
My gosh.

1547
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,880
I've been playing so little.

1548
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,400
Like it's kind of pointless for me to be calling in.

1549
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,400
All right.

1550
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,400
Well, then I'll hang up on you.

1551
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,400
What?

1552
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,400
I'll hang up on you then.

1553
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,400
Hey, jerk.

1554
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,400
You told me to call in.

1555
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,400
Well, because I thought you'd want to say hi because you weren't here in person.

1556
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,400
Oh, well, hi.

1557
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,400
All right.

1558
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,400
Bye.

1559
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,400
All right.

1560
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,400
1-877.

1561
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,400
I'm going to get spanked for that one later.

1562
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,800
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.

1563
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,160
Loki, got anything for us real quick?

1564
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,240
We'll take one more call.

1565
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:17,120
Circuit City is offering a pretty cool deal for people that purchase Call of Duty 4.

1566
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:21,120
Yay, Call of Duty 3 for free.

1567
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,120
That's for...

1568
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,200
Because you probably already own it.

1569
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,200
Hey, it's free.

1570
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,360
Because you wouldn't want to play it.

1571
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:31,360
It's free and also been leaked to the internet from what I've seen.

1572
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:38,200
Sensible Soccer or Sensible World of Soccer is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade

1573
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:44,120
this month, also coming out on the PSC.

1574
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,120
That's neat.

1575
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,120
Maybe.

1576
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,120
You said the game is how old?

1577
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,720
We're getting another call on Skype.

1578
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,280
Let's go take that and then we'll get to any more last minute stories.

1579
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,280
This will be our last call tonight.

1580
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,280
Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.

1581
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,280
Who's this?

1582
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,280
Hey, it's ShadowNextGen.

1583
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,920
Hello, ShadowNextGen.

1584
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,920
What's on your mind?

1585
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,160
How's it going?

1586
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,480
Pretty good.

1587
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,960
What did you want to talk about tonight?

1588
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,840
E for All, briefly, because I was there.

1589
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,160
How was E for All?

1590
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:14,640
E for All, despite a lot of the internet reports, was actually a lot of fun.

1591
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,200
There was a lot of games to play.

1592
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,880
I mean, obviously, Microsoft and Sony weren't there and those were the big omissions, but

1593
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:30,200
Metal Gear Solid 4, Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers, Contra 4, Call of Duty 4, Simpsons.

1594
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,800
There was Guitar Hero 3, Rock Band.

1595
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,720
There was quite a lot of games there to play.

1596
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,440
The biggest complaint I heard about E for All was very similar to what Rob had just

1597
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,920
said about Video Game Expo and that is you could have done it all in a day.

1598
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,520
Is that true?

1599
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,280
You probably could have, but I mean, I was there for the whole time.

1600
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:52,120
There was also the Video Game Live concert that I went to that was a lot of fun as well.

1601
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,120
Nice.

1602
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,120
Sounds like fun.

1603
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,540
That was right across the street from E for All.

1604
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:00,880
Did you wait in line for Super Smash Brothers?

1605
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,320
I didn't have to because I got in early, so I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.

1606
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,320
Nice.

1607
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,320
How was it?

1608
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,160
Super Smash Brothers was a lot of fun.

1609
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:16,280
I believe I played as Link and they had a level from Twilight Princess in there.

1610
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:22,440
They had the bridge level where you're jousting with that big enemy on the Warthog.

1611
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,880
So it was a lot of fun.

1612
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:28,000
Do you think this game has the potential to be OMG Best Game Ever?

1613
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,480
With all the new stuff that they're putting in, it could very well be with the level editor

1614
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:39,640
and the video record feature and it seems like every week they keep adding new features.

1615
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,640
Sounds pretty hot.

1616
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,260
I know I'm excited about it.

1617
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,840
And then I got to try the Wii Zapper I actually had fun with.

1618
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:49,520
Ah yes, the Wii Zapper.

1619
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,160
That's going to be coming out pretty soon, huh?

1620
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,360
They had Link's crossbow training there, which was pretty good, especially if you're a Zelda

1621
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:55,360
fan.

1622
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:01,320
I have a copy unordered because I've saved myself from purchasing other Wii games.

1623
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:06,160
I'm very excited to finally put the Wii Zapper bet to rest because we still have that going

1624
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,160
on too.

1625
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,160
I will kick your ass.

1626
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,160
The date bet.

1627
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,160
So anyway, we'll worry about that later.

1628
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,040
Mario Party DS was there, that was also a lot of fun.

1629
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:20,160
Oh yeah, I saw Mario Party 8 this weekend I forgot to mention.

1630
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,560
I saw it, I didn't play it.

1631
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,600
Because it was another Wii game that came out at the party.

1632
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,600
It's just another Mario Party game.

1633
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,600
I got it from my brother when I got him his Wii for the first time.

1634
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,080
But now you build hotels I guess or something, whatever.

1635
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,280
One of the maps has hotels on it or something.

1636
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,280
Anyway, sorry ShoutOutNextGen.

1637
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,080
What else is on your mind, buddy?

1638
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:44,040
I just wanted to say that E4ALL wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of the reports were making

1639
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,040
it out to be.

1640
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:50,800
They had about 18,000 people there I think they said, which is almost about a third of

1641
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,600
what E3 used to draw.

1642
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,520
I would say that's pretty good for a first year without Sony and Microsoft there.

1643
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,200
Well I'm glad to hear a dissenting opinion from someone who is actually there, we welcome

1644
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,200
that.

1645
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,680
What do you think though about next year, because apparently they have it timed where

1646
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,760
it's going to be very close to Penny Arcade Expo next year.

1647
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:11,880
Do you think that's going to be a good thing or bad or what?

1648
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:16,280
I think now I don't really see it being too good of a move because Penny Arcade is starting

1649
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,200
to get really huge.

1650
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:24,400
I don't know why they would want to draw away more potential exhibitors who would probably

1651
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,840
rather go up to Seattle.

1652
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,480
Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

1653
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,120
Walk the wait and see.

1654
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:33,800
Hopefully they'll smarten up and either they'll put it in October again or they'll put it

1655
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,260
earlier in the year.

1656
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:38,480
They might be playing a game of chicken right now to see if anybody backs down first, but

1657
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:39,480
we will see.

1658
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,240
Anyway, ShoutOutNextGen, we've got to let you go.

1659
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,080
We're going to try to wrap things up for tonight, but thanks so much for your call.

1660
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,200
All right, have a good night guys.

1661
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,200
All right, you too.

1662
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:52,080
It's good to hear from somebody who's actually there as opposed to all the hearsay on the

1663
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,080
internet.

1664
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,080
I'm so sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.

1665
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:59,240
I know we have more people that wanted to call in, but sadly we've got to get this show

1666
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,800
wrapped up because we are going on a three-hour program tonight and we've got to wrap this

1667
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,800
shit up.

1668
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,400
So, Loke, did you have anything else for last minute stories?

1669
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:11,120
Yeah, real quick, I was going to say Heavenly Stars is going to be in No More Heroes as

1670
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:16,640
well, as a song apparently, and I don't know, it should be pretty interesting.

1671
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:21,720
I guess you find a hidden VHS tape in the game or something.

1672
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,320
Well, it's kind of weird.

1673
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:28,860
Then let's see here, I laughed when I read this story.

1674
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:33,920
Apparently there were going to do some Assassin's Creed novels that were going to come out around

1675
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,820
the same time as the game.

1676
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:46,360
But apparently a sect of real-life assassins paid Ubisoft a visit and told them no.

1677
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,080
I don't know.

1678
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,240
I laughed at that.

1679
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:56,720
Then there was an interview with Naughty Dog about Uncharted where they said that they've

1680
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:01,400
only used 30% of the PS3's power for Uncharted.

1681
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,320
So if the game sucks, that's why.

1682
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,800
Let's see here.

1683
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:15,120
And then finally, Nintendo was also, the PR manager with Nintendo was interviewed regarding

1684
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:19,840
a couple things including a hard drive and friend codes.

1685
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:25,640
Eric Walter, of course, revealed no plans for a Wii hard drive despite the fact that

1686
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:29,000
the whole WiiWare service is going to be coming.

1687
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:38,180
And also as far as the friend's codes, apparently they've pulled people through different questionnaires

1688
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:44,800
and whatnot and people don't seem to be, they are undisturbed by them so they're going to

1689
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,800
stay.

1690
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,800
Hooray!

1691
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:52,040
I do want to add to the last minute news to follow up to our breaking news earlier.

1692
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,000
The character battle is over and it's official.

1693
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,800
L-Block is the new champion after the character battle.

1694
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:03,640
And now they're having an extra bonus round and today the L-Block is facing off against

1695
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:11,000
the paddle, the question mark block, and the weighted companion cube that's doing battles.

1696
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,760
I can already tell the weighted companion cube is going to win just because it's current.

1697
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,760
Actually, at the current time, now it is early on in the race, but at the current time L-Block

1698
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:22,720
is leading with almost 40% of the vote.

1699
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,520
Weighted companion cube is in second place but only with 27% of the vote.

1700
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,520
That'll change.

1701
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,560
The portal jokes are going to get old pretty soon, you guys.

1702
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,560
Alright.

1703
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:35,200
Anyhow, show is over, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1704
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,400
We'll start off with Puppy, thank you so much for being here and I'm glad you got to actually

1705
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,400
talk this time.

1706
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,400
Yay!

1707
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:45,160
So what is your final thought?

1708
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,880
I have cavities now from all this damn candy.

1709
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,040
I know, I need an insulin shot, Jesus.

1710
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,440
Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?

1711
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,640
I fucking love my iPhone.

1712
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:01,120
And my final thought is, I'm going to have a candy coma.

1713
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,360
Loki, your final thought?

1714
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:07,920
My final thought is I have way too many games to play this week and I hope my Wii works.

1715
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:08,920
Alright.

1716
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:09,920
Wii console.

1717
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:10,920
Thank you guys so much.

1718
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,920
I'm not worried about my Wii.

1719
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,920
I know that works just fine.

1720
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,920
Okay.

1721
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:18,000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Launch Radio and supporting

1722
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,040
Independent Radio.

1723
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,560
If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show or go leave us a nice

1724
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:28,280
review on iTunes, dang it, because we could always use some extra five-star reviews because

1725
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:34,000
that helps spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.

1726
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,680
We don't have any of those fancy magazines.

1727
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:37,680
That's right.

1728
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,080
We don't have any of that fancy-shmancy stuff to back us up.

1729
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,240
We do this because we love you all.

1730
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,360
Expensive print material.

1731
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,240
So we appreciate it.

1732
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:50,360
So you like one of those fancy magazines, you find it at Kmart.

1733
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,360
Sorry.

1734
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:58,280
Alright, on that note, until next week, I'm Rob, that's Jamie, that's Loki, and we're

1735
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,400
Orange Launch Radio.

1736
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:21,940
See you next week.

1737
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:30,620
Bye-bye.
