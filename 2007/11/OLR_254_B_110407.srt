00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,085

2
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:21,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimate Quest Ultimate Quest

3
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,079
[SPEAKER_12]: You've probably heard FootyMonster, maybe Xenocore, call in this show.

4
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:46,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they are hosts on another show over at All Games, and it's called Ultimate Quest.

5
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And that show should be out this week.

6
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,701
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they said Monday night or Tuesday afternoon-ish, so check them out at UltimateQuest.net.

7
00:00:52,981 --> 00:01:04,943
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a conversation about MMOs, and I was kind of like the guy there that played WoW on Final Fantasy XI, but it was a good panel because they had another guy that was like City of Heroes, and a couple were playing EVE Online, and

8
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:07,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of different MMOs being talked about.

9
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:10,583
[SPEAKER_12]: We were kind of talking about societies and getting into a pretty in-depth discussion.

10
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:11,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.

11
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:12,263
[SPEAKER_12]: I approve.

12
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:15,164
[SPEAKER_12]: So thanks to the kids at Ultimate Quest for having me on their program.

13
00:01:15,904 --> 00:01:17,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we can get back into some gaming news.

14
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:23,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so Super Mario Galaxy of course is coming out not next week, but the week after next.

15
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:30,227
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's been revealed that there's going to be a certain hidden playable character in the game.

16
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, when you...

17
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:36,686
[SPEAKER_14]: All 120 stars in the game.

18
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Complete all the purple coin missions.

19
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:40,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Defeated Bowser a second time.

20
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:43,692
[SPEAKER_14]: You can play as Luigi.

21
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:47,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And actually, Luigi, he will jump higher and further.

22
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:49,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Also runs faster, but has trouble stopping.

23
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And says otherwise they have the same moves.

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Luigi needs new sneakers!

25
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,642
[SPEAKER_14]: At least it's not, you know, Luigi's Mansion.

26
00:01:55,662 --> 00:01:56,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

27
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:21,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that would be, I'm glad it's not, you know, Luigi's Mansion embedded in the game.

28
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, I don't know, part of me thinks Luigi's Mansion got a bad rap.

29
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:24,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

30
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:28,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually liked Luigi's Mansion until it got to the baby part, and then the baby part kind of creeped me out.

31
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:30,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

32
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:32,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I thought you liked scary video games, though.

33
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:37,520
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a difference between stupid scary and, like, I like Silent Hill.

34
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Resident Evil.

35
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Mental screwing with your mind's scary.

36
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:48,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thanks to the ESRB ratings, some new games have been leaked for upcoming US Virtual Console releases.

37
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:59,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Alien Soldier is one of the games that is going to be coming to Virtual Console soon, as well as Shining Force 2 and Bubble Bobble will be coming to Virtual Console.

38
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:05,787
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is assumed that they have worked it out so that you can get past level 30 in the Virtual Console release of

39
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:08,169
[SPEAKER_12]: GoNintendo had a voicemail from...

40
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Mario himself.

41
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:25,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Charles Martinet.

42
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:25,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

43
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Announcing Super Mario Bros.

44
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:31,056
[SPEAKER_14]: 3 will be out tomorrow.

45
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:32,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Super Mario Bros.

46
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:32,797
3.

47
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario 3 is fucking rad.

48
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:36,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I love playing through Mario 3 and not using Warp Zones.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I love Giant World.

50
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Who doesn't love Giant World?

51
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:40,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Giant World's the best, but you know what?

52
00:03:40,743 --> 00:03:42,885
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite is going in on Kuriboh's shoe.

53
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:46,248
[SPEAKER_12]: There's only like one level in the whole game where you do that, huh?

54
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even a mandatory level, is it?

55
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,232
[SPEAKER_06]: But with the Game Genie code back in the day, you could keep the shoe through other levels.

56
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:53,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

57
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Which sort of made it stupid for the ones you have to fly to get shit though.

58
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:00,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Now all you need is to actually be able to play this game online.

59
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:06,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Like imagine if you could be Mario and play against a Luigi that's millions of miles away.

60
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:07,656
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that's not going to happen.

61
00:04:08,737 --> 00:04:09,277
[SPEAKER_12]: It should.

62
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:11,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But will it?

63
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:12,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

64
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:17,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, for UK Virtual Console we've got some fun stuff.

65
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:22,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic 3D Flicky's Island for 800 Wii Points will be out.

66
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:28,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the Sonic 3D games were sort of interesting.

67
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:35,040
[SPEAKER_06]: They weren't really, really 3D, just sort of 3D, but anyway.

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,621
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't believe it's not 3D.

69
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can't believe it's not 3D, exactly.

70
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:51,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, we also have, uh, as soon as it loads, Samurai Ghost, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, um, which is a side-scrolling, you know, slash-

71
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Fighter, Shooter, you know, guy with a sword game.

72
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,535
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's funny.

73
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:06,776
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole purpose of the game, according to the opening screen, is it's an order from the King of Heaven.

74
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:10,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have Art of Fighting, Neo Geo.

75
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:16,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to say anything more about Art of Fighting because that's the game that gave us... King.

76
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:22,499
[SPEAKER_06]: No, well, besides King, it gave us the two characters that spawned the introduction of Dan Hibiki.

77
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,603
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Street Fighter series, which would be Ryo and Robert Garcia.

78
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:30,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Was Dan supposed to be like a parody of them or something?

79
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:30,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he was.

80
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:31,507
[SPEAKER_12]: How funny.

81
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Ryo was like a Ryu knockoff.

82
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:45,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And Robert Garcia had, I guess, he had some other moves, so they actually combined the two characters into, you know, Mr. Sucktastic Godoken.

83
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought it was great.

84
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:47,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, keep in mind,

85
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:50,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan's like one of my favorite characters.

86
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:55,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in Puzzle Fighter, because you have to be really freaking good to beat people in Puzzle Fighter using Dan.

87
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he drops all red blocks.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to drop a lot really fast.

89
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you have to be really good.

90
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can proudly say that I've beaten somebody using Devilot.

91
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:08,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Or pray that a red break gem never falls.

92
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:09,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

93
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:13,425
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I digress.

94
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:15,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is the whole point of the show.

95
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:15,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Digression.

96
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:17,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

97
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:22,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, anyways.

98
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:27,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, we don't really talk too much about Atari.

99
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:33,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they don't give us a lot that's worth talking about anymore.

100
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,113
[SPEAKER_14]: In case you haven't heard, you know, Atari, they have not too many licensed games out there.

101
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think the last few licensed games haven't been that great.

102
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,638
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, what with the, they used to have the Driver series.

103
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:49,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi

104
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:18,965
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of sad to see because really all that they're going to be left after this is gone is pretty much Alone in the Dark.

105
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:21,306
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

106
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:24,787
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I have to say.

107
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:25,887
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, two things.

108
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,948
[SPEAKER_06]: One about Dragon Ball Z and one about Atari.

109
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:32,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Ball Z has been off the air in Japan when I graduated college.

110
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I didn't graduate college, but when I was out of high school.

111
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,991
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I take that back because I had an episode taped off the TV.

112
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the series ended.

113
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:42,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Ball GT Dragon Ball GT

114
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:13,034
[SPEAKER_06]: But it still doesn't mean it's not even old over here.

115
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still old.

116
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,755
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing is saturated.

117
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:18,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And that and Atari, oh my god.

118
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:25,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft says in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, Actdeft says, Atari, doing nothing since the 1980s.

119
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:35,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And to tell Ranma, Dragon Ball GT, in my opinion, does kind of count because it was going back to the original flair of what Dragon Ball was.

120
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:38,583
[SPEAKER_06]: But Dragon Ball Z was better.

121
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:38,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

122
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:40,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkai G3 Godzilla Unleashed

123
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:06,576
[SPEAKER_12]: and Jenga on the Wii and the DS.

124
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:09,758
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember reporting on this game when it was first announced.

125
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,260
[SPEAKER_12]: We were like, the fuck?

126
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't you just play, like, real Jenga?

127
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:16,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I believe they did at Penny Arcade Expo.

128
00:09:16,443 --> 00:09:17,464
[SPEAKER_12]: They played real Jenga.

129
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:23,488
[SPEAKER_14]: And to be honest, then they also have another, like, classic compilation game coming to the PSP.

130
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that's all that ever comes out on the PSP.

131
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:27,291
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

132
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,692
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all they have coming out of this year.

133
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:29,513
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Lone Dark...

134
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:33,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Dragon Ball Z was replaced by Brioni Kenshin.

135
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:52,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Rurouni Kenshin was replaced by Naruto.

136
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:54,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And now Bleach is doing its damnedest.

137
00:09:54,956 --> 00:09:57,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the transition I'd like to point out.

138
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:59,999
[SPEAKER_14]: And seriously, companies, stop making so many Naruto games.

139
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's like five every year.

140
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:04,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, we don't need that many Naruto games.

141
00:10:04,222 --> 00:10:07,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have like a stack of them in our vault collecting dust.

142
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:09,805
[SPEAKER_12]: In the vault.

143
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,747
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it really is the vault.

144
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:15,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a whole room dedicated to my video game collection.

145
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:15,789
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

146
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:29,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anyhow, you know, they say imitation is the finest form of flattery, but I don't know about this one, because apparently there is now, Walmart is now selling these little knockoff Wiimotes.

147
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:39,558
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a device made by ToyQuest, and what it is, it basically looks like a Wiimote, but it has a little LCD screen on the Wiimote.

148
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:44,339
[SPEAKER_12]: And you actually can play tennis...

149
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:46,736
[SPEAKER_12]: with this Wiimote.

150
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:53,938
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little tiny LCD screen, but I don't even think it has motion control or whatever because the screen is so fucking tiny.

151
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:55,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be hilarious if it did.

152
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:55,978
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you see it?

153
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,918
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll swing it and then, oh shit.

154
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,259
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

155
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone needs to hack it to be a VMU emulator and put a chow on there.

156
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, these things cost under $20.

157
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to say it said it was like $7 for this thing.

158
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,081
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be too much for this.

159
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:12,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about that.

160
00:11:14,861 --> 00:11:20,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Quality People should give crappy useless toys to the bad children instead of coal Because you can actually use coal

161
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,833
[SPEAKER_12]: This is what you get for being a bad kid.

162
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:50,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that like driving kids by a burned out factory telling them that Disneyland burned down or something?

163
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:52,403
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was deep thought.

164
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,304
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that was deep thought.

165
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:54,225
[SPEAKER_06]: It was jack handy.

166
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, so yeah, those are kind of stupid.

167
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:00,153
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know what?

168
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:10,888
[SPEAKER_12]: These types of things and these knockoffs and these unoriginal bastards and tiny little LCD screens that try to pass for a game, these things just piss us off and it makes us angsty.

169
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we get mad, people die.

170
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Or at least the FUs of the week are unleashed.

171
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:38,263
[SPEAKER_06]: F you goes towards the digestion problems I inherited from my mother.

172
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom, fuck your genes.

173
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I love you.

174
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:44,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And her birthday's tomorrow.

175
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:46,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy birthday to my mom, who will be 48.

176
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday, Jamie's mom.

177
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:54,408
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, yeah, everything I eat really makes me sick.

178
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just going to stop eating altogether.

179
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:59,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for couscous.

180
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:18,629
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to Saints Row for not allowing you to change what your character looks like when you're playing system-linked multiplayer.

181
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,612
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody looks like the same dude wearing the same black t-shirt and the same jeans.

182
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:24,595
[SPEAKER_14]: F.U.

183
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:28,018
[SPEAKER_14]: to the bruise on my leg that still kinda hurts this week but at least it's getting a little better

184
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:51,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I can roll my pants up far enough I can show you one cat.

185
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:52,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I probably can't.

186
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,214
[SPEAKER_12]: My bruise is like in here.

187
00:13:53,234 --> 00:13:54,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't roll my pants up that far.

188
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:58,719
[SPEAKER_12]: I might be a little too much skin for Operator 11, so no show for you.

189
00:13:58,739 --> 00:13:59,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say one more thing real quick.

190
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,240
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

191
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,343
[SPEAKER_14]: My cat tried to perform like a level 3 execution on my wife's legs.

192
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,745
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Manhunt 2 reference.

193
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:07,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

194
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,368
[SPEAKER_14]: She attacked her leg with her back claw and it like sliced it.

195
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:12,850
[SPEAKER_14]: It looked like she was trying to like cut her leg off or something.

196
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:13,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy kitty.

197
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,454
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, without... It was the cutest level 3 execution ever.

198
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:20,498
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it, my F.U.

199
00:14:20,518 --> 00:14:21,959
[SPEAKER_12]: just went to my bruise on my leg.

200
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So at least I don't have to have the band-aid on it anymore.

201
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:25,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy!

202
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:26,604
[SPEAKER_13]: My F.U.

203
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:32,629
[SPEAKER_13]: goes to your neighborhood for there being no street lights and street signs covered by trees.

204
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I almost got lost getting here because I couldn't read anything.

205
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:44,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I like followed him all the way from like the big main road over and I was like, hey, I bet that's Puppy.

206
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,746
[SPEAKER_06]: because I saw the college sticker on your car.

207
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:50,508
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was like, he went right past Rob's street.

208
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost went right past Rob's street.

209
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:54,950
[SPEAKER_12]: It is kind of, yeah, they don't really have streetlights here.

210
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,452
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't invent them yet, I guess, when these houses were built.

211
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:57,832
[SPEAKER_12]: What can I say?

212
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:58,532
[SPEAKER_13]: It's rural.

213
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:08,899
[SPEAKER_13]: And F you to the housing market because I got scared a little bit and when half the people that I work with at my company got laid off this week.

214
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,019
[SPEAKER_13]: D'oh.

215
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,581
[SPEAKER_13]: No, well, I work for a...

216
00:15:13,567 --> 00:15:19,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I do drafting work for a carpenter, and they just laid off a bunch of their foremen.

217
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:22,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I get laid off.

218
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:29,790
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, because if I get laid off, I get like three months of severance pay and can collect unemployment while I start my massage business.

219
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,611
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be fantastic.

220
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:33,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

221
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:34,271
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be nice.

222
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:36,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice little cushion.

223
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:39,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well that's going to do it for our FUs of the week.

224
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:43,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?

225
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:45,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Shall we?

226
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,725
[SPEAKER_12]: We shall.

227
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:48,486
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, why don't you take it away?

228
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:49,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't wanna.

229
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:50,427
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta.

230
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:51,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

231
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:52,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I said so.

232
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

233
00:15:55,008 --> 00:16:02,111
[SPEAKER_06]: For anyone who follows the Child's Play charity, the 5th annual Child's Play charity drive is beginning.

234
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:13,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it was the whole charity was the brainchild of the Penny Arcade Powers That Be

235
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:19,585
[SPEAKER_06]: and is now basically the gaming community's way of giving to those in need.

236
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:24,887
[SPEAKER_06]: For children who are in hospitals in 25 states and 5 countries.

237
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:32,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can donate your items through Amazon and it is considered a tax-deductible gift.

238
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,770
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep that in mind if you have those deductions coming up.

239
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,151
[SPEAKER_06]: The drive... Sorry.

240
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:45,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Their fundraiser dinner, I apologize, is set to take place on December 11th at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.

241
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:47,828
[SPEAKER_06]: So go play.

242
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the brainstorming, folks.

243
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:55,134
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to think of what we here at OLR can do to help out this lovely charity that gives gamers a good name.

244
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:58,556
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll have to think of something we can donate or a fundraiser we can do.

245
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we'll have a ditter-thon, a DDR-thon.

246
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:02,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't that be fun?

247
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, maybe not.

248
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:05,622
[SPEAKER_12]: You never know.

249
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:06,702
[SPEAKER_12]: You never know.

250
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:07,463
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll think of something.

251
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:13,493
[SPEAKER_14]: So, one awesome game that's coming out this year has gone gold, and that would be Crysis.

252
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:19,254
[SPEAKER_14]: It's due out November 16th, so I hope you have your new PC by now, because you're going to need it.

253
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:23,236
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, it'll be the first game to utilize the CryEngine 2.

254
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,857
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's not the same engine used in Yaris.

255
00:17:26,897 --> 00:17:28,297
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a different CryEngine.

256
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:33,459
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, hopefully it'll be coming to consoles soon.

257
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:36,980
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a single-player demo that's available now, which...

258
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:46,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Hackers have gone ahead and poked their noses through some of the DirectX workaround codes inside there.

259
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:51,830
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've found stuff like hidden weapons, vehicles, and bad guys from the full version.

260
00:17:51,910 --> 00:18:01,373
[SPEAKER_14]: So now, with a little bit of cutting and pasting, they're able to play with every gun in the game, as well as tanks and attack chopper.

261
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:03,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like how I play games.

262
00:18:03,174 --> 00:18:04,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it does.

263
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:05,915
[SPEAKER_14]: All the guns, a tank, and an attack chopper.

264
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:12,201
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

265
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:35,670
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of like Think Sam and Max, but like really, really long.

266
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,492
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to start in 2008 in the spring, and they're already running the ads on it.

267
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:45,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And the little quote from the ad says, And of course, you know, American McGee did that Alice in Wonderland game that was, you know, pretty fucked.

268
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,001
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure you're going to see lots of your fairy tales done the right way.

269
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:05,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Dark and gory, the way they were originally.

270
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:13,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I will be looking forward to, I imagine this is going to have to be in it, the Hansel and Gretel, because I can't wait to push the witch in the oven.

271
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:14,507
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll be fun.

272
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,749
[SPEAKER_06]: The original fairy tales were all kinds of messed up.

273
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:20,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who would read that to their children?

274
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:22,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I would.

275
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:28,139
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see... My mom handed me the book and said, go read it and don't come bother me until you finish this chapter.

276
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:33,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see the Grimm fairy tales done by Sam and Max because I think that would be awesome.

277
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:35,902
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be kind of fun.

278
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:38,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways.

279
00:19:39,064 --> 00:19:43,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony is going to be doing an animated Resident Evil movie.

280
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:46,327
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a CG animation.

281
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:49,669
[SPEAKER_06]: They're calling it Biohazard Degeneration in Japan.

282
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:50,129
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

283
00:19:52,590 --> 00:20:00,235
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a presumption that it's going to be called Resident Evil Finding Necro over here, which is kind of a dumb name.

284
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:04,198
[SPEAKER_06]: They said it's going to have groundbreaking visual effects and a brand new storyline.

285
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh well, we'll see.

286
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:09,401
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be out in 2008.

287
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:10,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Nah, we won't see.

288
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:11,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really want to see it.

289
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:16,866
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'm kind of over Resident Evil like 10 years ago.

290
00:20:16,906 --> 00:20:18,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked the last movie.

291
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:20,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I did.

292
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:31,317
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're over Resident Evil, perhaps you may be interested in a few other films that are coming, including Onimusha, which is starting production in April.

293
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:38,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently they also have a poster now revealed for the Tekken movie.

294
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Which the poster looks stupid, I might add.

295
00:20:42,202 --> 00:20:45,364
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a giant T that looks like it's being held up.

296
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:46,485
[SPEAKER_13]: T for Tekken!

297
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:48,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, it's creative.

298
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

299
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:52,410
[SPEAKER_14]: It's already down the road of DOA.

300
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:56,133
[SPEAKER_14]: It's apparently the Onimusha... Dead on arrival.

301
00:20:56,473 --> 00:21:01,177
[SPEAKER_14]: The Onimusha adaption, of course, is expected to begin April of 2008.

302
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:05,901
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, Silent Hill director Christopher Gans is going to be at the helm.

303
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:08,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that may not suck.

304
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:36,797
[SPEAKER_12]: may not and unfortunately the Tekken poster if I were to sum up the movie based on the poster I would say suck and how many times based on the poster I'd be all where's Big Bird to tell me this episode was brought to you by the letter T and the number 69 and how many times have fighting games made good movies

305
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I remember the Tekken anime that came out.

306
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:45,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, animes are usually better than movies anyways.

307
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:55,164
[SPEAKER_06]: The Tekken anime, my problem with that is that it was all completely done on computer, and I prefer cell animation, so that's what was bad about that.

308
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,825
[SPEAKER_14]: That also had a lot of butt rock in it.

309
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:02,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the US one.

310
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Video Games Becoming Movies

311
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:13,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Pirates of the Caribbean

312
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:44,031
[SPEAKER_12]: That probably means you can't actually type your own sentences.

313
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:50,374
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to make things from the pre-rendered things that are in there because we have to keep our children safe because these are Disney games.

314
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Like using the Final Fantasy XI macros?

315
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:53,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that for sure.

316
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:54,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't quote me on that.

317
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:56,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that's the case in this game.

318
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:59,899
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if any of our chatters have played it, but I just know in Toontown that was the case.

319
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,801
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a friend that played Toontown for a long-ass time, actually.

320
00:23:04,242 --> 00:23:07,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Pirates of the Caribbean, I wouldn't mind checking this out.

321
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:10,645
[SPEAKER_13]: I would check it out, but Puzzle Pirates would probably still be better.

322
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:11,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

323
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:17,197
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and plus, my fondness for Pirates of the Caribbean is the ride, not the movie.

324
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:22,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that might be like blasphemy to some people, but I could care less about Johnny Depp.

325
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Although he was a kind of cool addition to the ride.

326
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:29,704
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, some of the other stuff they added on the ride.

327
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:30,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow.

328
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:31,861
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:02,334
[SPEAKER_12]: We will see.

330
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:10,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, um, we have one that says, Hey guys, I was wondering if you could recommend some older 360 games that might be worth picking up used.

331
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:13,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking about PSU, but not sure if it was any good, thanks.

332
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:15,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And this comes from Mark.

333
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, PSU sucks, so don't play it.

334
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:20,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

335
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:22,812
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

336
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:48,411
[SPEAKER_14]: You can also play the offline version for free, so, I mean, don't necessarily think you have to play it online.

337
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:50,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus, the expansion's coming out here pretty soon.

338
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:57,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It should, they've already done a buttload of, my friend Julie, Casame19, she plays a butt ton.

339
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:00,420
[SPEAKER_12]: She is always on that fucking game whenever I'm on live.

340
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,221
[SPEAKER_06]: She does nothing but play that game.

341
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:03,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, amazing.

342
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So, she's like, that's her Evercrack.

343
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:10,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Tips from the chatroom, Rob with two B's is mentioning Circuit City has PSU on the cheap.

344
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:12,345
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you are interested in that.

345
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Some other folks are recommending some games.

346
00:25:14,186 --> 00:25:15,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft recommending Condemned.

347
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:18,128
[SPEAKER_12]: DMN recommending Crackdown.

348
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:20,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Crackdown is the I like jumping game.

349
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,070
[SPEAKER_12]: I recommend staying the hell away from Perfect Dark Zero, first off.

350
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked Perfect Dark Zero.

351
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:29,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would suggest Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

352
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:33,013
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that is the best 360 title.

353
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:33,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Burnout.

354
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:38,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I do like Cache.

355
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:40,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if it is an old game with souped up graphics.

356
00:25:41,037 --> 00:25:42,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Or how about Test Drive Unlimited?

357
00:25:42,598 --> 00:25:44,298
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a good game that I think was... How about No?

358
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:46,799
[SPEAKER_14]: How about Kiss My Butt?

359
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:50,961
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want some older games that have dropped in price, Dead Rising.

360
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Dead Rising is a good one.

361
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:54,001
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can find that.

362
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:57,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, Far Cry Instinct's Predator wasn't that bad.

363
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:58,943
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you said good games.

364
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:03,585
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I would also say probably...

365
00:26:06,946 --> 00:26:08,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Not Prey, that's for sure.

366
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:11,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely not Chromehounds.

367
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Prey was like Ghetto Portal.

368
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:18,217
[SPEAKER_14]: But I wouldn't buy Burnout, because there's a new Burnout game coming out in January.

369
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:28,066
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say probably... Okay, we've given enough suggestions.

370
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:32,010
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not that old, but Oblivion is also really good for a solo game.

371
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,621
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an email from another Mark.

372
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:37,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Your suggestion quota is up.

373
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:38,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi Mark.

374
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:39,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, it's amazing.

375
00:26:39,922 --> 00:26:42,983
[SPEAKER_06]: My brother and I were talking about Count Dekula, but we couldn't remember the name.

376
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,004
[SPEAKER_06]: We also loved You Can't Do That on Television.

377
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:45,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Barf.

378
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:48,745
[SPEAKER_06]: About Loki's a few of the week to women.

379
00:26:49,466 --> 00:26:51,106
[SPEAKER_06]: If you haven't learned by now, you will.

380
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,747
[SPEAKER_06]: You as a male will always lose arguments against women.

381
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:55,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't believe it when people told me.

382
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:56,208
[SPEAKER_06]: True statement.

383
00:26:56,388 --> 00:26:57,028
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's true.

384
00:26:57,288 --> 00:27:00,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Men are from Mars and women have already invaded it and destroyed all that are holy.

385
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course we have.

386
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:03,057
[SPEAKER_06]: because we're excellent.

387
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:08,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to find more short ones because we've got a couple of long ones.

388
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:16,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on because I'm trying to load a little something for that last emailer because I played the You Can't Do That

389
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:27,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Castle Ducula, home for many centuries to a dreadful dynasty of vicious- Tell me you would not play a fucking video game based on this.

390
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,617
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be awesome.

391
00:27:30,237 --> 00:27:36,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend has it that these foul beings can be destroyed by a snake through the heart, or exposure to sunlight.

392
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,821
[SPEAKER_08]: This does not suffice, however, for they may be brought back to life.

393
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:44,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize, the audio is so low.

394
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:49,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Once a century, when the moon is in the eighth house, we will be blood.

395
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:54,864
[SPEAKER_08]: The latest reincarnation did not run according to plan.

396
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's ketchup.

397
00:27:57,584 --> 00:28:00,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the techno part, yes.

398
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:05,306
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Vampire Hall of Fame, yeah, there's no vampires any other.

399
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:07,066
Don't you, don't you hurt me.

400
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,647
Cause it's a vampire.

401
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:23,599
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the most random opening.

402
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:25,220
Count Ducula.

403
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Count Ducula.

404
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:29,562
[SPEAKER_06]: For anyone who doesn't know, God, it's so loud.

405
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:34,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Count Ducula was actually a character from Danger Mouse.

406
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:35,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

407
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:37,365
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone who ever watched Danger Mouse.

408
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:43,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So the southern one says, the classic game of the week segment seems to be like obscure cult hit of the week.

409
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,689
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, will you be featuring games that are a little more known to us?

410
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I did Cyberbots.

411
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, like everybody knows Cyberbots.

412
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:51,344
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people know Cyberbots.

413
00:28:51,404 --> 00:28:51,665
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Kong.

414
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:52,045
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Kong.

415
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,220
[SPEAKER_12]: and maybe she'll feature it later.

416
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:08,621
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

417
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:10,162
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of like the obscurity for now.

418
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:16,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, keep in mind that all of the classic games that I like are really the more obscure ones anyway.

419
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, if I'm going to be picking out the games, I'm going to be picking out all the weird shit that I like.

420
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:23,137
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, but I covered Fantasy Zone.

421
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:24,178
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not obscure.

422
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

423
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,463
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, okay, I'll do Guardian Legend.

424
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Even that's kind of obscure for some people.

425
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:34,395
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my favorite game.

426
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:35,596
[SPEAKER_12]: I say do what you want.

427
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,076
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm going to do what I want.

428
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:37,336
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

429
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:38,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to do what I want.

430
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I go to school and I kill people.

431
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I run with gangs.

432
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,420
[SPEAKER_12]: I digitally insert Jabba the Hutt back in Star Wars.

433
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I do what I want.

434
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,740
[SPEAKER_12]: I run with gangs.

435
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,383
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be fair, I do like a good number of, I guess, more mainstream titles.

436
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:57,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't do one of Colibri.

437
00:29:58,294 --> 00:29:58,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Neo Geo Pocket Color

438
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:27,257
[SPEAKER_06]: and on the... No, just on the Geo Pocket Color.

439
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:27,917
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

440
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:28,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't bother defending.

441
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:31,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Just say, I'm going to do what I want.

442
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:34,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying how people can find these games easily.

443
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:34,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

444
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:40,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So it did have a US release, so... Anyway, this one comes from J-Rod.

445
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:41,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, J-Rod.

446
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Love the show you guys put on.

447
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:45,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I really dig how the show is live.

448
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:48,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two guitars on my PS2 with both Guitar Hero 1 and 2.

449
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:54,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the problem is I don't have my PS2 anymore, but I do have a PS3, a 60 gig that can play the old PS2 games.

450
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:59,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently Sony and everyone else didn't bother to make an adapter to get the Guitar Hero controllers to work on the PS3.

451
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if any of you guys had any first-hand experiences.

452
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:10,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you anyone who did with the aftermarket adapters out there and could give me a recommendation or review of any of them?

453
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:11,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, and keep up the awesome show.

454
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Pelican makes one that works.

455
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:16,480
[SPEAKER_14]: There is an adapter out there I know that works.

456
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,661
[SPEAKER_14]: I would bet money it causes a delay, though.

457
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:19,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it did.

458
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:20,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

459
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:20,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

460
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:23,503
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's one that we did as a story a while back.

461
00:31:23,663 --> 00:31:25,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Luckily, I didn't actually bet the money.

462
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,065
[SPEAKER_14]: That actually does work, so...

463
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:30,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Xenocore in chatroom.

464
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:32,867
[SPEAKER_12]: See, when we don't know, we can always rely on chatroom.

465
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:35,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Xenocore in chat says, not true, I have the adapter.

466
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:36,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you have it.

467
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:38,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

468
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

469
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:42,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also, I think that it was great.

470
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:43,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony doesn't love you there.

471
00:31:44,554 --> 00:31:49,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think it's fantastic that it says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the NeverEnding Salads.

472
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:51,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I find that funny.

473
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Olive Garden.

474
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for the salad, though.

475
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:58,904
[SPEAKER_06]: OLR, I appreciate that you guys tell us the Japanese release dates, but I was wondering if you guys have any Japanese listeners.

476
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:01,419
[SPEAKER_06]: and I guess this comes from Thomas.

477
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:02,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we do.

478
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure we do.

479
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:08,043
[SPEAKER_06]: When we check the stats, we do see quite a number of connections from Japan.

480
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:10,945
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've gotten emails from listeners in Japan before too.

481
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:15,808
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got people all over the world because we are cool that way.

482
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:18,490
[SPEAKER_06]: So now for the really freaking long emails.

483
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,050
[SPEAKER_06]: How about that?

484
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:20,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

485
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Really freaking long email segment.

486
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:24,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear OLR,

487
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:30,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Pointing to a letter that was sent to you last week, it really shames me that a fellow gamer can be so blatantly ignorant.

488
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:38,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anyone ever considered the fact that one of the main reasons that Nintendo has managed to stay afloat for so long is because of its first party games?

489
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:42,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting with the Nintendo 64, the graphics of the system sucked.

490
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:53,423
[SPEAKER_06]: The audio play was horrible, but it still managed to give you a few of the great franchises that you and I loved, like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and other well-known franchises, and bring them, though it still looked horrible...

491
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:57,302
[SPEAKER_06]: and Bring Them, but it still looked horrible.

492
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,364
[SPEAKER_06]: The GameCube may have been a different story.

493
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:01,225
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, the GameCube was a great system.

494
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:07,308
[SPEAKER_06]: While not on par with that of the Xbox and PlayStation 2, it had excellent graphics and almost all games played in high frame rate.

495
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:12,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Pardon me for being ignorant, but what Metroid game was on Nintendo 64?

496
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:15,393
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

497
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:15,813
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't.

498
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:21,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Prime was on... No, it was a big deal when Prime came out because it was OMGZ Metroid.

499
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:21,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

500
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:22,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Never mind.

501
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:24,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

502
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:24,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Snap, yo!

503
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Snap, yeah!

504
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:26,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, to continue with this,

505
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:50,013
[SPEAKER_06]: It had excellent graphics and almost all games played in full frame rate.

506
00:33:50,513 --> 00:33:56,622
[SPEAKER_06]: It also brought your favorite franchise into beautiful 3D detail, but it would have been so much better if they had online play.

507
00:33:56,723 --> 00:34:00,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have even bought my GameCube if it didn't have a new Metroid game.

508
00:34:02,597 --> 00:34:09,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's first party developers have managed to bring back our favorite franchises and make us love them that much more with each new title.

509
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:16,789
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mainly because of the fact that Nintendo first party developers and the fact that they make such great games are the only reason that Nintendo managed this far.

510
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:24,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Though I may not know everything, I just want to point out that these few details are far as it goes with Nintendo's first party games and developers.

511
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:27,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just hope that it doesn't repeat any past mistakes.

512
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:31,281
[SPEAKER_06]: To the Yaris, this is a letter that was sent to the Xbox Live Arcade.

513
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:32,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It said...

514
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:35,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Xbox Live Arcade, we have always had a great relationship.

515
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,820
[SPEAKER_06]: The day I met you, you sent me Geometry Wars.

516
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you send me Yaris.

517
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this mean you're breaking up with me?

518
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:41,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely, Anonymous.

519
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:44,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Brilliance.

520
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:45,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Winner.

521
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:47,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Email of the week right there.

522
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:49,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've got another long one.

523
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:50,386
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the last one.

524
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:52,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by DJ Dysentery.

525
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:53,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

526
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:55,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Best name ever.

527
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:57,590
[SPEAKER_12]: You have died of dysentery.

528
00:34:58,382 --> 00:34:59,983
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not wearing that shirt tonight, sadly.

529
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:04,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wearing my panda with the panda and crossbones instead of skull and crossbones.

530
00:35:04,206 --> 00:35:04,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR.

531
00:35:04,546 --> 00:35:05,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your show.

532
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all are amazing.

533
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:06,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a southern guy?

534
00:35:07,028 --> 00:35:07,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

535
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:11,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I listen to y'all everywhere I go and named my firstborn daughter Skye.

536
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:13,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

537
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:15,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Send the birth certificate as proof.

538
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:16,375
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe it.

539
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:17,596
[SPEAKER_06]: So on and so forth.

540
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

541
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:26,302
[SPEAKER_06]: To beat the proverbial dead horse, your qualms concerning the term microtransactions would give even Captain Jean-Luc Picard a headache of massive proportions.

542
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,925
[SPEAKER_12]: would you say Halo 3 sold 3 giga copies?

543
00:35:58,465 --> 00:36:04,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Micro in this sense is not used as a prefix for an actual numerical factor such as centi, milli, kilo, nano, etc.

544
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:08,108
[SPEAKER_06]: but more as a description of relative size in contrast with macro.

545
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:12,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Refer to the established English terms of macroeconomics and microeconomics, if you will.

546
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:15,490
[SPEAKER_06]: But no one says microtransactions anyway.

547
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:15,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

548
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:23,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as the English language is to buzzwords, human being is to a horribly grotesque cross-species partial abortion, think Minotaur.

549
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:24,672
[SPEAKER_06]: It never should have

550
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:40,292
[SPEAKER_06]: should have been and should have been put out of its misery, which I'm quite sure the entirety of Orange Lounge Radio will be quite eager to do after reading this superfluous, verbose, and... Thank you, whoever emailed this in to make her read these words.

551
00:36:40,792 --> 00:36:42,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I have very good pronunciation.

552
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:42,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

553
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:46,138
[SPEAKER_06]: A vexatiously nitpicky email comprised of run-on sentences.

554
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have to agree with you there.

555
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,021
[SPEAKER_06]: It is fairly run-on.

556
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Although actually you are grammatically correct in your last sentence, I have to say.

557
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:58,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I shall spare you any further opportunities to become tongue-tied and I wish you all the best.

558
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:02,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to each episode as eagerly as a cocaine addict awaits for his next hit of snow.

559
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:05,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Rubber buggy baby bumpers, DJ Dysentery.

560
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:11,089
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, you... By the way... Okay, he obviously was putting that in just to fuck with you.

561
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,270
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, you misspelled cocaine.

562
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:16,725
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

563
00:37:39,853 --> 00:37:40,593
[SPEAKER_06]: There already is one.

564
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:41,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there really?

565
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:43,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure there already is one.

566
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:47,175
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also... You can find a podcast.

567
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:51,216
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there is a Grammar Nazi podcast because somebody sent it to me.

568
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:53,397
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not even kidding.

569
00:37:53,417 --> 00:37:54,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can I download it?

570
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:56,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember who...

571
00:37:57,114 --> 00:38:12,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Who did it, but I listened to it about a year and a half ago where they would receive emails about different grammatical mistakes and then try to give you the proper way to say that and certain usages and when it's appropriate to use this spelling or that spelling.

572
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:19,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also found one that was all about the differences between British English and American English.

573
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:21,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Where can I got that podcast?

574
00:38:23,027 --> 00:38:23,207
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL

575
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:25,133
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

576
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do what everybody else does and search for it on iTunes.

577
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:29,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't wanna.

578
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:32,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate that my iPhone is making me use iTunes, though.

579
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you continue, please?

580
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,060
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

581
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:35,681
[SPEAKER_12]: We's done.

582
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:36,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no more emails?

583
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:38,023
[SPEAKER_06]: We is done.

584
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:38,863
[SPEAKER_12]: We is done.

585
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:42,046
[SPEAKER_12]: We done good on those emails.

586
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, if you want emails, mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com.

587
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to the people we didn't get to tonight.

588
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,091
[SPEAKER_12]: There's just too damn many emails.

589
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:49,611
[SPEAKER_12]: What can we say?

590
00:38:50,271 --> 00:38:50,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to the gaming news.

591
00:38:51,351 --> 00:39:15,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, with all these patches and stuff being applied to new games for the PlayStation 3 and games that you might already have on the PlayStation 3, to support the DualShock 3 has gotten a lot of people wondering, hey, maybe I can just import a Japanese DualShock controller into my non-Japanese country and get to play these games with RumbleTastic features sooner than everybody else.

592
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:16,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

593
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:21,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Because apparently importers like PlayAsia said they've already pre-sold their expected supply.

594
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:25,957
[SPEAKER_14]: And Sony, of course, doesn't support importing stuff.

595
00:39:27,438 --> 00:39:32,622
[SPEAKER_14]: So you will not be able to probably buy any anytime soon.

596
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:41,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Because actually importers are charging upwards to $80 per joystick for what you would probably normally get for $50.

597
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:43,512
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure that's going to go up.

598
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:56,575
[SPEAKER_14]: of course you know new games you just had a patch for Resistance Fall Man that added Rumble I know Motorstorm has Rumble now there was a patch with Ratchet and Clank Future that has Rumble just fucking wait

599
00:39:57,677 --> 00:39:59,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Why would they have to patch in rumble features?

600
00:40:00,318 --> 00:40:04,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you know the original 6-axis controller had no rumble.

601
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Because rumble would interfere with the tilt sensors somehow in this magical world.

602
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,421
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you can't actually have tilt and rumble in the same controller.

603
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:15,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh wait, no, Nintendo did that.

604
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:15,982
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

605
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:19,723
[SPEAKER_14]: So, hey.

606
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:21,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Just wait.

607
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:21,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Really.

608
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:25,244
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, plain, you know,

609
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:30,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Resistance, Fallen Man with Rumble is not going to make it like, oh my god, this is the best game ever now!

610
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:33,300
[SPEAKER_13]: The only game I really want to play with Rumble is Rez.

611
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:36,723
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would hand off the Rumbler to someone else.

612
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:38,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, Rez is on the PS3.

613
00:40:38,864 --> 00:40:39,865
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all read that article.

614
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:47,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we have a, I guess, late-breaking news thing.

615
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,776
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to jump in here with something that's panning out live while the show is going on.

616
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:52,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I need like a

617
00:40:53,573 --> 00:40:55,275
[SPEAKER_12]: A fanfare or something.

618
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:57,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Or we need something.

619
00:40:57,678 --> 00:40:58,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

620
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,120
[SPEAKER_12]: What do we have?

621
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,042
[SPEAKER_12]: How about a drum roll with a laptop?

622
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:03,724
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking for a fanfare noise.

623
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:04,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on.

624
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:04,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

625
00:41:06,868 --> 00:41:07,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.

626
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:08,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we go.

627
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:08,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

628
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,110
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got it.

629
00:41:09,711 --> 00:41:11,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Now some late breaking news.

630
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:11,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

631
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:26,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft is practically flooding our chat room with what is going on in the latest Game Facts Battle.

632
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,549
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, every damn year they do a character battle, every year.

633
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,093
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the sixth year of the character battle.

634
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:38,189
[SPEAKER_12]: And what makes this year different is that instead of two characters doing battle, it's groups of four.

635
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,249
[SPEAKER_12]: And then two emerge victorious.

636
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:42,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we are now down to the final four.

637
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And typical winners, Link and Cloud, are in there.

638
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:47,391
[SPEAKER_12]: They've both won before.

639
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Solid Snake is also in the top four.

640
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:59,973
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is the amazing thing is that this looks to be the very first year that a Final Fantasy character or a Link character will not win

641
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:01,099
[SPEAKER_12]: L-Block

642
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:23,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I miss something?

643
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:24,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously?

644
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:26,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Tetris is pwned.

645
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:30,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Because somehow an L block just fucking beat all these other characters.

646
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:31,429
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, though?

647
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Well deserved, honestly.

648
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:40,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Well deserved, because Tetris is one of those games I think people forget, you know, that is the casual game.

649
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,872
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the casual game that really opened up the game to a lot of people.

650
00:42:42,912 --> 00:42:45,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just glad that news had nothing to do with Tingle, so that's... Yes.

651
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:49,914
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought for a second there they were just going to be like, yeah, Tingle's going to win.

652
00:42:49,954 --> 00:42:50,674
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, fuck.

653
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:54,008
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to suck.

654
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:55,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait for that.

655
00:42:55,108 --> 00:42:58,829
[SPEAKER_12]: This just in, Eye of Judgment sold its millionth copy.

656
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:00,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, get the tights.

657
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,011
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some interesting things about Eye of Judgment too.

658
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:09,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know how many people have come into chat tonight and said, one down, 999,199 to go.

659
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:12,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Our whole contest has become counterproductive.

660
00:43:12,453 --> 00:43:14,734
[SPEAKER_12]: We are driving sales of Eye of Judgment.

661
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:17,595
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard they have issues.

662
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:18,950
[SPEAKER_14]: How so?

663
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me put it this way.

664
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:24,794
[SPEAKER_14]: They have similar issues to Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.

665
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:27,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

666
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:32,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Certain integral parts of... They're not even going to be able to make a million of them.

667
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:33,419
[SPEAKER_12]: You goddamn cheater!

668
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:38,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki fucking cheated in this contest.

669
00:43:38,662 --> 00:43:40,664
[SPEAKER_12]: He knew they didn't have the parts to make a million of them.

670
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: How about I cleanse the palette?

671
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:42,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Asshole.

672
00:43:43,906 --> 00:43:45,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And didn't I say this was going to happen?

673
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't I tell you?

674
00:43:47,935 --> 00:43:49,937
[SPEAKER_12]: No, wait, I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't do my actual story.

675
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:50,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought you did.

676
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:51,298
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

677
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:51,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine.

678
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:53,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to do the Famitsu story real quick.

679
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fine, do it.

680
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,766
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going off on your tangents, confusing me.

681
00:43:58,926 --> 00:43:59,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

682
00:43:59,526 --> 00:44:00,267
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it!

683
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:02,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Chocolate!

684
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:06,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Get the bitch some chocolate, Christ almighty.

685
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:06,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah!

686
00:44:08,476 --> 00:44:09,136
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not going to eat it.

687
00:44:09,256 --> 00:44:09,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

688
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:13,078
[SPEAKER_12]: And damn it, I accidentally closed the tab that had this story on it.

689
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:13,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I can't even do it.

690
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:18,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Famitsu ran a list of the top 100 games that readers dig.

691
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:24,784
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, this is kind of similar to the character battle because I believe all the top games were basically Final Fantasy games and Zelda games.

692
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:26,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to bring up the list right now.

693
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:29,162
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

694
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:58,878
[SPEAKER_12]: were that.

695
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:03,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Other notable games on the chart, we should point out Street Fighter 2 came in at number 20.

696
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:06,226
[SPEAKER_12]: The Super Mario Brothers came in at 21.

697
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:09,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy 6 was in 25.

698
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,131
[SPEAKER_12]: The fuck?

699
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:12,052
[SPEAKER_12]: 6 is like one of the best ones.

700
00:45:12,072 --> 00:45:14,975
[SPEAKER_06]: But Final Fantasy 7 has more fandom-y stuff.

701
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:15,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh well.

702
00:45:16,161 --> 00:45:17,261
[SPEAKER_12]: Japan, you screwed that up.

703
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:19,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Chrono Trigger, number 28.

704
00:45:19,942 --> 00:45:21,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Kingdom Hearts 2, number 29.

705
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:25,144
[SPEAKER_12]: The original Legend of Zelda, 46.

706
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:26,925
[SPEAKER_12]: 51, Pokemon Red and Green.

707
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:33,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you want to know where L Block ended up on the Famitsu list, 96 was where Tetris Game Boy ended up.

708
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:34,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Gradius was on there.

709
00:45:34,707 --> 00:45:35,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Gradius was 98.

710
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:36,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Mario Bros.

711
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:37,108
[SPEAKER_12]: 3 was 99.

712
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:38,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know where R-Type is.

713
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:42,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you'll just have to pick up this week's Famitsu magazine.

714
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:45,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to go to San Francisco to go buy it.

715
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:46,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, you can do your story now.

716
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

717
00:45:48,642 --> 00:45:50,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Now again, didn't I say this was going to happen?

718
00:45:50,744 --> 00:45:54,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And don't get me wrong, I love the technology.

719
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:57,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one myself built into my PS3.

720
00:45:57,993 --> 00:46:00,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Blu-ray, but I also loved Betamax.

721
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:05,744
[SPEAKER_06]: and Betamax was far superior to VHS.

722
00:46:05,984 --> 00:46:09,325
[SPEAKER_12]: I would also like to point out DarkSakura has an impressive Laserdisc collection.

723
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:13,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I do, because I used to go to anime conventions and they'd sell Laserdisc for five bucks a piece.

724
00:46:13,887 --> 00:46:16,748
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically, if DarkSakura likes your media format, you're fucked.

725
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:18,749
[SPEAKER_12]: She probably has a collection of 8-tracks somewhere.

726
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:20,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Laserdisc did last for a while.

727
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the enthusiast format.

728
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:28,073
[SPEAKER_14]: You could saw off someone's head with one of those things, too.

729
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:30,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they were pretty heavy.

730
00:46:30,094 --> 00:46:31,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever happened to Videodisc?

731
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:34,238
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

732
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:03,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

733
00:47:04,171 --> 00:47:05,491
[SPEAKER_12]: That would fucking rock.

734
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:10,595
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope PlayStation 4 has those large pizza-sized discs.

735
00:47:11,095 --> 00:47:11,936
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be rad.

736
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:15,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I want my next system to be the size of three Atari 5200s.

737
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,000
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.

738
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want it to weigh as much as ten Xboxes.

739
00:47:23,244 --> 00:47:25,665
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to have to get a dolly to put this thing in my house.

740
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:29,668
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the Xbox is larger than an Atari 5200, but not wider.

741
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:30,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Tangent.

742
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:30,989
[SPEAKER_12]: What were you going to say about Blu-ray?

743
00:47:31,454 --> 00:47:37,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Kmart's not selling them anymore, so anyone, whatever, you know, no one really shops at Kmart.

744
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:43,859
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know Kmart was still around.

745
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,041
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the personal opinion that gets interjected in this show.

746
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:50,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I take that back.

747
00:47:50,362 --> 00:47:51,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's tonight's news.

748
00:47:51,942 --> 00:47:53,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Kmart pulled Blu-ray.

749
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:54,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever, no one shops at Kmart.

750
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:56,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I take that back.

751
00:47:56,944 --> 00:47:58,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I did buy pillows at Kmart because they were on sale.

752
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And I bought my sheets for my massage at Kmart.

753
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:04,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, no one shops at Kmart.

754
00:48:05,271 --> 00:48:09,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I don't know if Kmart's exactly the demographic for Blu-ray.

755
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:11,172
[SPEAKER_12]: That's exactly what I'm saying.

756
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:13,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Who thinks, gee, I'm going to go get a Blu-ray player.

757
00:48:13,712 --> 00:48:17,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Where can I get a really good, top-of-the-line Blu-ray player that's, I'm going to go to Kmart.

758
00:48:18,553 --> 00:48:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, keep in mind, even though Kmart did declare bankruptcy, they did go back and buy Sears.

759
00:48:24,094 --> 00:48:24,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

760
00:48:24,954 --> 00:48:25,174
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

761
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:28,695
[SPEAKER_12]: If I want an Icy, I'll go to Kmart.

762
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:28,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

763
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:32,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I go there to buy sheets for my massage table and that's about it.

764
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:36,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Or if heaven forbid I want something from the Martha Stewart collection, I'll go to Kmart.

765
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:38,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Or if I want to go laugh at the poor people.

766
00:48:39,696 --> 00:48:40,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Just kidding.

767
00:48:41,356 --> 00:48:41,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm among you.

768
00:48:42,116 --> 00:48:45,838
[SPEAKER_12]: And Ranma is yelling in chat, hey dammit, I shop at Kmart.

769
00:48:46,158 --> 00:48:48,399
[SPEAKER_12]: RavensDolphin says, shit, I shop at Kmart.

770
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:56,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Much like I go back to the conversation we had in part A where I said, LARPing, something you don't really want to admit to.

771
00:48:59,952 --> 00:49:00,453
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

772
00:49:00,513 --> 00:49:01,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the reason why I don't... Okay.

773
00:49:02,655 --> 00:49:06,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore, even though this isn't supposed to be Dude, they have little Caesars.

774
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

775
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,661
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I shop at Kmart.

776
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:15,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I do also sometimes buy my DVR discs for my camera.

777
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:16,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

778
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the thing.

779
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:21,412
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to, my fondest memories of going to Kmart going shopping were in the 80s.

780
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:25,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we used to go, you know, it would be like the big department store trip day, we're going to go to Kmart.

781
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:27,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the problem, here's the reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore.

782
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:32,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the store hasn't fucking changed a thing since the 80s.

783
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Besides what's on the shelves.

784
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:35,162
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not even the clothes.

785
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:36,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Except... Yes.

786
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:39,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Except I did find a cute sweater there.

787
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:43,541
[SPEAKER_06]: But it also was like one of those 80s revival styles.

788
00:49:43,921 --> 00:49:47,083
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I saw some underwear for sale that was actually from the 80s.

789
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:47,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought socks.

790
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:53,946
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy socks at Kmart because socks, you know, are socks.

791
00:49:54,086 --> 00:50:02,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they actually still have those doors that you have to like step on the mat where it triggers the door before infrared technology or something like that.

792
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:04,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, can we move on before we get the hate mail from the Kmart?

793
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:07,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, they're not carrying Blu-ray players anymore, so whatever.

794
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:10,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the hate mail from that one Kmart person, okay.

795
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:11,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

796
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, here's some exciting news, and I'm going to say this is very specific exciting news.

797
00:50:18,043 --> 00:50:19,184
[SPEAKER_14]: It has nothing to do with Kmart.

798
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:20,265
[SPEAKER_14]: It has nothing to do with Kmart.

799
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:23,787
[SPEAKER_14]: LucasArts and BioWare are teaming up for something.

800
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:26,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Something.

801
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:28,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's right.

802
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,222
[SPEAKER_14]: They're working on an undisclosed interactive entertainment product.

803
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:34,123
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's LucasArts and BioWare, so what else do you really need?

804
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:34,823
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be awesome.

805
00:50:34,843 --> 00:50:36,784
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be like Knights of the Old Republic or something like that.

806
00:50:37,525 --> 00:50:39,966
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Knights of the Old Indiana Jones Republic, that's right.

807
00:50:41,047 --> 00:50:43,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel the need to say something nice about Kmart now.

808
00:50:45,649 --> 00:50:49,991
[SPEAKER_06]: They do carry the diet cranberry serumist.

809
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:53,313
[SPEAKER_12]: I will pre-order the LucasArts BioWare game at Kmart.

810
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:53,713
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I won't.

811
00:50:54,074 --> 00:50:56,475
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will tell you one thing that Kmart's good for.

812
00:50:57,785 --> 00:50:59,686
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't care about street dates.

813
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:05,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's where I got Serenity, like two weeks before it came out.

814
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:10,694
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got it as an early Christmas gift for Extover, and he was all excited because he had Serenity on DVD before any of his friends.

815
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:12,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry, LucasArts?

816
00:51:13,516 --> 00:51:14,497
[SPEAKER_12]: They're making something.

817
00:51:14,557 --> 00:51:14,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

818
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:15,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Hooray!

819
00:51:18,112 --> 00:51:19,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Rumors, rumors, rumors.

820
00:51:19,934 --> 00:51:23,598
[SPEAKER_12]: And this rumor has something to do with Oblivion.

821
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:25,400
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right, the Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

822
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,422
[SPEAKER_12]: The game that just won't stay out in the news.

823
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:30,085
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, this game has been making headlines since it came out.

824
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:39,155
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, it should be noted that the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, that's ZeniMax Media, has registered the domain name

825
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:49,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Elder Scrolls Online.com Could this mean that Elder Scrolls Oblivion could make its way online?

826
00:51:49,722 --> 00:51:50,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Be an MMO?

827
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:53,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Hell, somebody already hacked the game to do this on the PC version.

828
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:56,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Could this be a further way to milk the Oblivion franchise?

829
00:51:56,608 --> 00:51:57,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knows?

830
00:51:57,169 --> 00:51:59,270
[SPEAKER_14]: It could give World of Warcraft a run for their money.

831
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Puppy, how many hours have you spent on Oblivion?

832
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,180
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot.

833
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,040
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot, right?

834
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,141
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot in a two-week span of time.

835
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:07,461
[SPEAKER_12]: So what would you think of this?

836
00:52:07,801 --> 00:52:11,122
[SPEAKER_12]: If there was an Oblivion online, would you play it, or is this jumping the shark?

837
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:12,282
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

838
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:18,663
[SPEAKER_13]: With as much characterization and customization areas, I don't know.

839
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,484
[SPEAKER_13]: They would have to do a lot to expand the world.

840
00:52:22,624 --> 00:52:29,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Because running around in the world in Oblivion, it's like running, running, running, running, tree, rock,

841
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:31,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh look, a rabbit.

842
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:32,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Run, run, run, run, run.

843
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:33,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh look, hey look, a dungeon.

844
00:52:34,346 --> 00:52:36,447
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be punching horses online.

845
00:52:37,147 --> 00:52:37,868
[SPEAKER_14]: In the face.

846
00:52:38,308 --> 00:52:40,069
[SPEAKER_12]: A sheep tossing contest would be fun.

847
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:41,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.

848
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:42,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you know what it doesn't have?

849
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,211
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't kick bugs in the face.

850
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:48,332
[SPEAKER_12]: You can kick sheep in the face, probably.

851
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,313
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't kick bees in the face.

852
00:52:56,576 --> 00:52:58,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm looking at chat right now.

853
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:02,011
[SPEAKER_12]: I gotta go back to the Kmart thing because this shit's funny.

854
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:08,035
[SPEAKER_12]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Kmart still sells Rakas Dukakis shirts.

855
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Hilarity.

856
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:19,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob with 2B says, I go to Kmart to trip over stuff in the aisles.

857
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:24,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Blue light special.

858
00:53:25,488 --> 00:53:26,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, anyway, sorry.

859
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:31,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so Elder Scrolls may be online, at least if recent domain names are to be believed.

00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:17,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, apparently the reaction to Soul Calibur Legends going gold is, Who gives a fuck?

893
00:55:17,908 --> 00:55:19,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be crappy anyways.

894
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:26,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, did anyone remember, what was that stupid game with, it's like a spin-off of Tekken.

895
00:55:26,812 --> 00:55:30,253
[SPEAKER_14]: God, I've blocked it from my brain.

896
00:55:30,273 --> 00:55:32,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, the one that had Nina, it starred Nina, didn't it?

897
00:55:32,952 --> 00:55:33,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Quick, Jamie, Tekken Trivia.

898
00:55:33,912 --> 00:55:34,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Death by Degrees.

899
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:34,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

900
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:35,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Death by Degrees.

901
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:36,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.

902
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,314
[SPEAKER_14]: That's this game all over again.

903
00:55:43,495 --> 00:55:44,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Ivy, Death by Degrees.

904
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:46,976
[SPEAKER_12]: But will she have the whip?

905
00:55:47,036 --> 00:55:47,757
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all we need to know.

906
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually kind of wanted Death by Degrees just because of me being a big Tekken nerd.

907
00:55:52,618 --> 00:55:56,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I even have the dumb Tekken game that was on Wonderswan.

908
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,500
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty sad.

909
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,560
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Tekken Card.

910
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,941
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like buying Tekken on your cell phone.

911
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:02,181
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

912
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:08,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick, another story, then the Skype line.

913
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:11,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, um, yes.

914
00:56:12,591 --> 00:56:17,573
[SPEAKER_14]: So this totally, I don't know, perpetuates all the stereotypes of...

915
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:19,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Halo 3 Players

916
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:46,000
[SPEAKER_14]: was told by his mother to turn off his Xbox 360 as it was getting late.

917
00:56:46,380 --> 00:57:04,043
[SPEAKER_14]: After he refused, his mother took his AirCard, which is apparently an adapter you can use for your cell phone to get Wi-Fi, from the 360, preventing him from playing online and prompting a fit of rage that would see the child frantically search through the house before punching his mom in the face.

918
00:57:05,504 --> 00:57:11,805
[SPEAKER_14]: The kid then retreated to his room, but soon had to deal with the local sheriff deputies, who his mom

919
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:13,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

920
00:57:41,704 --> 00:57:42,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Kids these days.

921
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:44,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Kids do the darndest things.

922
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:52,047
[SPEAKER_13]: But now I can just imagine people on Halo yelling, Oh, you stupid mother puncher!

923
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:54,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, dude, this is stupid anyways.

924
00:57:54,927 --> 00:57:57,588
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, your fucking kid is, like, playing Halo.

925
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:58,848
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a maturity game.

926
00:57:59,388 --> 00:58:02,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, it must be the violence of the game that caused him to punch his mom in the face.

927
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:09,191
[SPEAKER_06]: What I really want to know is, um, what have they been doing to their child up to that point?

928
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:11,870
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have a violent reaction.

929
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:15,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe their child already had psychological problems.

930
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:15,753
[SPEAKER_06]: You know.

931
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:18,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Took them to Kmart.

932
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's our new OLR in-joke.

933
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:26,222
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Kmart.

934
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:28,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Timmy, it's Disneyland.

935
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:29,284
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Kmart.

936
00:58:29,784 --> 00:58:31,045
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's Disneyland.

937
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:32,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Kmart.

938
00:58:32,586 --> 00:58:34,288
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Disneyland.

939
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:35,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Go play.

940
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:36,950
[SPEAKER_06]: But it seems to me...

941
00:58:37,853 --> 00:58:38,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I was freaking some fucking noobs!

942
00:58:38,994 --> 00:58:39,194
[SPEAKER_06]: You know...

943
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:06,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan's little cousin's kid comes over and plays games at our house sometimes.

944
00:59:06,465 --> 00:59:08,145
[SPEAKER_12]: And has he ever punched you in the face?

945
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:09,065
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

946
00:59:10,626 --> 00:59:12,406
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always been well-behaved.

947
00:59:12,506 --> 00:59:14,687
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because his parents teach him right.

948
00:59:15,687 --> 00:59:24,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a fault with the parents, but I do think it's good that she did have him actually stand accountable for what he did.

949
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:27,467
[SPEAKER_12]: ShadowCharlie asks, how old was this kid?

950
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:31,248
[SPEAKER_14]: The age and name were withheld.

951
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:33,609
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard he was just 15 or something like that.

952
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:37,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I heard you suck.

953
00:59:40,011 --> 00:59:41,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, your mom.

954
00:59:41,551 --> 00:59:44,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, some Florida kid.

955
00:59:47,413 --> 00:59:49,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Indian River County website.

956
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:53,475
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a website for Indian River County for Florida.

957
00:59:54,229 --> 00:59:55,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Where to stay, where to dine, what to do.

958
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Discover our lifestyle choices, including dying.

959
00:59:59,552 --> 01:00:03,774
[SPEAKER_13]: With pictures of old people on a golf course and on a beach and in a dining room.

960
01:00:04,114 --> 01:00:04,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Dying.

961
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:06,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

962
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Lordy, lordy, lordy.

963
01:00:07,476 --> 01:00:11,238
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's open up the Skype line.

964
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:16,100
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

965
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:19,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

966
01:00:20,523 --> 01:00:22,644
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can comment on any of tonight's stories.

967
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:24,444
[SPEAKER_12]: or you can make a Kmart joke.

968
01:00:24,484 --> 01:00:25,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really care tonight.

969
01:00:26,485 --> 01:00:29,307
[SPEAKER_12]: After tonight's show, I'm like crying from laughing so hard.

970
01:00:29,648 --> 01:00:30,508
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that funny.

971
01:00:30,848 --> 01:00:34,791
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I'm going to be listening to this show like in the car later, so I'm going to go, this show really wasn't that funny.

972
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:35,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Why were you laughing so much?

973
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:37,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

974
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:37,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

975
01:00:38,694 --> 01:00:41,015
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.

976
01:00:41,316 --> 01:00:43,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.

977
01:00:43,938 --> 01:00:45,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you just get back from Kmart?

978
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:48,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just got back from Kmart, and guess what?

979
01:00:48,361 --> 01:00:49,421
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no Blueway players!

980
01:00:49,982 --> 01:00:51,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?

981
01:00:52,526 --> 01:00:54,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Galaxy, that's what's on my mind.

982
01:00:54,748 --> 01:01:03,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, but let's not go there.

983
01:01:04,339 --> 01:01:10,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Jamie said that she's getting a retail copy at her store, so I actually got the chance to play it at a GameStop.

984
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:12,428
[SPEAKER_10]: And what did you think, young man?

985
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:14,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the game looked great.

986
01:01:14,763 --> 01:01:15,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the controls.

987
01:01:15,944 --> 01:01:18,006
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the game just looked great.

988
01:01:18,166 --> 01:01:24,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, well, the game was on an HDTV, so it left a lot to be desired, which was a little sad.

989
01:01:25,032 --> 01:01:26,974
[SPEAKER_09]: A little sad about that, but the controls were great.

990
01:01:27,054 --> 01:01:28,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything was great about it.

991
01:01:29,096 --> 01:01:32,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a game that kids across the country are going to be craving come this Christmas season?

992
01:01:33,259 --> 01:01:33,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Craving?

993
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,760
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to be dying for it.

994
01:01:35,501 --> 01:01:38,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to be shooting each other like they were PS3s?

995
01:01:39,284 --> 01:01:39,685
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

996
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:40,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

997
01:01:42,011 --> 01:01:45,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, you know, if you want to get the game, just never mind.

998
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to make a joke, but I'm beating that joke on the ground.

999
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:54,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Mario Galaxy is so awesome, you'll punch your mother in the face just to play some more.

1000
01:01:57,425 --> 01:01:58,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, is the game that great?

1001
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:00,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it worth punching your mom in the face over?

1002
01:02:01,248 --> 01:02:02,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so, but...

1003
01:02:05,749 --> 01:02:08,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go ahead and call his mom so that we know to hide.

1004
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:10,334
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know what your child is saying.

1005
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:14,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, what else did you call it to tell us about Ravenstaff?

1006
01:02:14,177 --> 01:02:16,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And you just wanted to say that Mario Galaxy is cool?

1007
01:02:17,793 --> 01:02:20,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Galaxy and Phoenix, sorry, Charles and Turbobout is very good.

1008
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:22,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Music's phenomenal.

1009
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:22,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god.

1010
01:02:22,858 --> 01:02:27,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, you know Shane, who used to guest on this show a lot before he moved back to Kansas.

1011
01:02:27,442 --> 01:02:31,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, okay, we have a Ventrilo server for World of Warcraft slash Final Fantasy XI, basically.

1012
01:02:31,486 --> 01:02:32,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Be careful on those.

1013
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:38,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, yeah, I've heard... No, I want Ventrilo Harassment Guy to sign on to our Ventrilo.

1014
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:41,096
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, roll out the fucking red carpet for him.

1015
01:02:41,116 --> 01:02:42,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that guy's fucking hilarious.

1016
01:02:42,898 --> 01:02:46,320
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, I would be so honored if he came on.

1017
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,920
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be like, yay, it's Ventrilo the Harassment Guy.

1018
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:53,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, the thing about Shane, though, is that he has been signing on to Ventrilo this week.

1019
01:02:54,223 --> 01:02:55,464
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're like, Shane, where are you?

1020
01:02:55,504 --> 01:02:57,865
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not in WoW, and you're not playing Final Fantasy XI either.

1021
01:02:57,885 --> 01:02:59,205
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, oh, I'm playing Phoenix Wright.

1022
01:03:01,806 --> 01:03:03,547
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're like, why are you signed on to Vent?

1023
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:05,128
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, I don't know.

1024
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:05,988
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm playing Phoenix Wright.

1025
01:03:06,008 --> 01:03:06,929
[SPEAKER_12]: I just thought I'd say hello.

1026
01:03:07,669 --> 01:03:08,529
[SPEAKER_12]: He's like, okay, I've got to go.

1027
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:09,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a case.

1028
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:10,230
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I need to do?

1029
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:13,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to play Guild Wars and Ragnarok at the same time

1030
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been doing this experimental podcast called the Cartoon Cast.

1031
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:38,559
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been talking about Count Ducula and showing old cartoons like that.

1032
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:40,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to see a Count Ducula game.

1033
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Who wouldn't?

1034
01:03:44,182 --> 01:03:46,404
[SPEAKER_14]: I would not like to see a Count Ducula game.

1035
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:47,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1036
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:50,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the show's been off the air for years.

1037
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:53,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Dragon Ball Z has been off the air for years.

1038
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:55,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we still getting games?

1039
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:56,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Atari, that's all they got.

1040
01:03:56,668 --> 01:03:57,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know what?

1041
01:03:57,209 --> 01:04:00,952
[SPEAKER_12]: They probably still show episodes of it on the Kmart TVs, okay?

1042
01:04:01,072 --> 01:04:05,235
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I've seen episodes of Count Dracula on TV a while back.

1043
01:04:06,777 --> 01:04:07,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

1044
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:08,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what the internet's for, right?

1045
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:09,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

1046
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:10,180
[SPEAKER_06]: That important.

1047
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:10,820
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got YouTube.

1048
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:11,821
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1049
01:04:12,201 --> 01:04:12,862
[SPEAKER_10]: YouTube's amazing.

1050
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:13,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that it then, Raven's Dolphin?

1051
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:15,344
[SPEAKER_10]: That is it.

1052
01:04:15,404 --> 01:04:16,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for taking my call.

1053
01:04:16,605 --> 01:04:17,766
[SPEAKER_12]: You are most welcome, sir.

1054
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:18,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great week.

1055
01:04:19,908 --> 01:04:20,108
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1056
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, he hung up on himself.

1057
01:04:22,244 --> 01:04:23,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even click the button.

1058
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:29,810
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to give us a call or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1059
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:31,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1060
01:04:31,191 --> 01:04:31,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1061
01:04:32,732 --> 01:04:34,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's truly Legend of Zaku.

1062
01:04:35,073 --> 01:04:36,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1063
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:36,955
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1064
01:04:37,935 --> 01:04:38,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, nothing.

1065
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:43,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mind me for the fact that this girl just dumped me a short while ago.

1066
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,441
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry to hear that.

1067
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:45,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

1068
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:49,504
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I guess, you know... Whiskey makes it all better.

1069
01:04:50,782 --> 01:04:51,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie.

1070
01:04:51,242 --> 01:05:01,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Manhunt 2, you know, that whole, that whole controversy, that whole clusterfuck that, that Rockstar Manson Okay, seriously, Zaku, wait, I gotta stop you right here.

1071
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:01,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay?

1072
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:05,973
[SPEAKER_12]: After breaking up with your girlfriend, I would not recommend playing Manhunt 2.

1073
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:08,034
[SPEAKER_12]: That's gonna give you totally bad ideas.

1074
01:05:08,454 --> 01:05:10,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna, I'm not, I'm a sidler, right?

1075
01:05:10,996 --> 01:05:13,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to him since I was like, what, 11?

1076
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:20,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I guess, I don't know, I don't get, I don't get why, you know, why companies like Rockstar just, you know, they try to

1077
01:05:21,246 --> 01:05:36,476
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to half-ass their way by just covering up stuff, you know, covering up, you know, bits that were thrown back when the ESRB told them to, and all of a sudden, you know, hackers find a way to make us gamers look bad, to make the industry look bad.

1078
01:05:39,287 --> 01:05:46,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, when they said, oh, we're going to mask this stuff, that was just an open invite to the hackers to say, find out how we mask this and unmask it.

1079
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:54,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know I can understand that the rating board actually knew about the content.

1080
01:05:55,616 --> 01:06:15,667
[SPEAKER_00]: that was blurred out, but wouldn't it make more sense not to give ammunition to the critics, to anyone who's out to get people like Rockstar for the fact that they get called out on stuff that was supposedly rejected before but is still in the game, just not seen.

1081
01:06:15,687 --> 01:06:24,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like the whole hot coffee thing, where it still shouldn't have been on the disc in the first place.

1082
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:39,354
[SPEAKER_00]: and they should have learned not hiding, not obscuring it from the ratings board, not doing that, but just not having the common sense to not keep it out of the disc in the first place.

1083
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:46,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So be it if you have to recreate the build, but that shit happens in our job.

1084
01:06:46,596 --> 01:06:50,517
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what just occurred to me because we were talking about Oblivion a little bit ago?

1085
01:06:52,197 --> 01:06:53,658
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this is very strange.

1086
01:06:53,778 --> 01:06:54,618
[SPEAKER_12]: It just occurred to me

1087
01:06:55,416 --> 01:07:04,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they not make Bethesda go back and re-rate Oblivion because somebody found a way to hack the game so that the girl's top could come off and you could have boobies?

1088
01:07:04,663 --> 01:07:08,626
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have to understand... Isn't this the same fucking thing?

1089
01:07:09,127 --> 01:07:20,796
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to understand that, you know, we don't know whether or not that company, you know, submitted that, you know, all the assets for the characters within, you know,

1090
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:23,497
[SPEAKER_00]: for the ratings board.

1091
01:07:23,757 --> 01:07:24,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1092
01:07:24,438 --> 01:07:24,779
[SPEAKER_00]: But hold on.

1093
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:26,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had an epiphany with this whole thing.

1094
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:27,644
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, totally.

1095
01:07:27,684 --> 01:07:28,165
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute.

1096
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,011
[SPEAKER_12]: I just owned ESRB.

1097
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:31,772
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

1098
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:32,153
[SPEAKER_14]: You didn't.

1099
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:33,115
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's why.

1100
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:33,816
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because...

1101
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,405
[SPEAKER_14]: That was on the PC that they did the mod.

1102
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:44,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Mods on PCs are fairly available, whereas a PSP version, the hack it, means you have to have an illegitimate copy of the game.

1103
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,551
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, it's on principle.

1104
01:07:47,092 --> 01:07:48,913
[SPEAKER_14]: What a fucking great line we are walking.

1105
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:52,595
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't have been on the disc or on the actual... It's fucking boobies too.

1106
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:56,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they should have just taken the AO rating.

1107
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, I think the problem is that the AO rating is the kiss of death.

1108
01:08:01,442 --> 01:08:02,503
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the same problem with X-Men.

1109
01:08:02,523 --> 01:08:08,226
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because the problem is the AO rating means your game does not get published for the PlayStation 2, the Wii, or the PSP.

1110
01:08:08,246 --> 01:08:09,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the problem.

1111
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:10,488
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.

1112
01:08:10,508 --> 01:08:12,089
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get limited to one platform.

1113
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:22,055
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing you have to understand is that legislators right now, they want to push bills that will add more quote-unquote truth in the ratings.

1114
01:08:23,237 --> 01:08:30,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically trying to find a way to call people out for mods, even if it wasn't the responsibility of the designer itself.

1115
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:32,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the fact that it shouldn't give people...

1116
01:08:42,068 --> 01:08:49,032
[SPEAKER_00]: should give hackers or any folks like that the tools to create that much controversy to give that much ammo.

1117
01:08:49,112 --> 01:08:54,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to agree with Fursby in our chat room on that who says it's just fucking pixels.

1118
01:08:55,516 --> 01:08:55,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And I agree.

1119
01:08:56,016 --> 01:09:02,340
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pixels, but then it's something that the human brain can translate as boobs.

1120
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:11,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, let's also realize that the legislators making these decisions and trying to get all this stuff done, they're like generations behind us.

1121
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:14,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're only out to score political points.

1122
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:18,264
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the bill's fate be damned.

1123
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:18,724
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

1124
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:20,526
[SPEAKER_00]: All they care about is keeping their seat.

1125
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:25,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, once they die off and go away, we'll get some smarter people in there and things will be better.

1126
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:28,913
[SPEAKER_12]: But then we're going to run into the same complaints.

1127
01:09:29,213 --> 01:09:31,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Zaku, I've got to let you go because we're going on five minutes of this call.

1128
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:32,956
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to get some more calls.

1129
01:09:33,056 --> 01:09:34,277
[SPEAKER_12]: But thank you for your perspective.

1130
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:35,878
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate it as always.

1131
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,499
[SPEAKER_12]: And sorry to hear about the girl.

1132
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,162
[SPEAKER_12]: There's plenty of fish in the sea, Zaku.

1133
01:09:41,062 --> 01:09:41,563
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll find one.

1134
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:41,903
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1135
01:09:42,922 --> 01:09:48,047
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1136
01:09:48,107 --> 01:09:49,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1137
01:09:49,128 --> 01:09:49,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1138
01:09:50,389 --> 01:09:51,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is Rob with 2Bs.

1139
01:09:51,871 --> 01:09:53,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, Rob with 2Bs.

1140
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:54,093
[SPEAKER_12]: How you doing, sir?

1141
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:55,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm doing fine.

1142
01:09:55,655 --> 01:09:58,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I just decided to call in because it was too long to write in chat.

1143
01:09:58,898 --> 01:10:06,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, I think we hear from you a lot on email and totally appreciate it, but I think this might be the first time I can recall you calling into the show.

1144
01:10:07,106 --> 01:10:07,226
[SPEAKER_12]: It's

1145
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:08,222
[SPEAKER_07]: VG Expo

1146
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:32,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1147
01:10:32,775 --> 01:10:34,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I just said the forbidden phrase on the show.

1148
01:10:34,737 --> 01:10:35,197
[SPEAKER_12]: My bad.

1149
01:10:35,237 --> 01:10:37,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially since the man is near rabid.

1150
01:10:37,479 --> 01:10:39,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, what did you want to say about America's VG Expo?

1151
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you go, Rob?

1152
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:42,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I went on Saturday.

1153
01:10:42,883 --> 01:10:46,225
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is only worth a day trip if you live in the area.

1154
01:10:47,566 --> 01:10:53,170
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in Philadelphia Convention Center, which is downtown, about 10 minutes from the airport.

1155
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hate to admit it, but it was a better location.

1156
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,555
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the Rock Band Tour event.

1157
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:04,110
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the Dell Intel Hi-Def Tour.

1158
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:06,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh, I'm trying to remember.

1159
01:11:06,491 --> 01:11:08,532
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a few contests on Guitar Hero.

1160
01:11:09,072 --> 01:11:12,094
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's all I can remember.

1161
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:15,055
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like there was a lot to see.

1162
01:11:15,075 --> 01:11:16,215
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like it was E for All.

1163
01:11:17,436 --> 01:11:23,178
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't go to E for All, but you get done with things fast there.

1164
01:11:24,299 --> 01:11:30,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, they didn't have much on the forums or anything.

1165
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:47,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, on the day I was there, they had the journalist forum, they had the Mortal Kombat movie, they had their Jack Thompson panel, and they had something I skipped, the Postal 2 preview.

1166
01:11:49,424 --> 01:11:50,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds skippable.

1167
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:55,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make it short, so anybody who didn't go can understand what went on.

1168
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:01,483
[SPEAKER_07]: The Game Journalists interviews is always a good one and nobody goes to it.

1169
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:05,846
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's... Gosh, I can't remember the names of the people.

1170
01:12:06,006 --> 01:12:07,387
[SPEAKER_12]: What kind of game journalists were they?

1171
01:12:07,427 --> 01:12:09,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Were they independent folks like us that do podcasting?

1172
01:12:09,848 --> 01:12:13,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Or were we talking like folks from GameSpot, 1UP type people?

1173
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:14,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1174
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:17,934
[SPEAKER_07]: We had one from 1UP, one from GameStop.

1175
01:12:18,554 --> 01:12:19,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Not GameStop, EGM.

1176
01:12:19,655 --> 01:12:20,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1177
01:12:20,255 --> 01:12:21,556
[SPEAKER_07]: The original editor of EGM.

1178
01:12:22,577 --> 01:12:23,397
[SPEAKER_07]: When it was spelled out.

1179
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:24,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1180
01:12:26,943 --> 01:12:30,824
[SPEAKER_07]: They had the director of marketing for Ziff Davis.

1181
01:12:33,565 --> 01:12:34,546
[SPEAKER_07]: He was really informative.

1182
01:12:35,266 --> 01:12:49,391
[SPEAKER_07]: To make a long story short, the best thing he said was, if you want to be a game journalist, and he said this because it's in their own company, you should blog on 1UP and make reviews less than 90 words.

1183
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:50,511
[SPEAKER_07]: That's

1184
01:12:52,498 --> 01:12:52,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait.

1185
01:12:52,978 --> 01:12:54,219
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best way to get noticed.

1186
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:58,761
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to be a game journalist, you should get reviews that are less than 90 words?

1187
01:12:59,621 --> 01:12:59,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1188
01:13:01,302 --> 01:13:01,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Yaris.

1189
01:13:01,522 --> 01:13:02,102
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really short.

1190
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:02,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Sucks.

1191
01:13:05,043 --> 01:13:10,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes at least 10 more words to get your mom on Mother of the Year nomination.

1192
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:16,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really sucks.

1193
01:13:17,849 --> 01:13:18,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

1194
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:18,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

1195
01:13:18,949 --> 01:13:19,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it.

1196
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:19,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yaris.

1197
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yaris.

1198
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:22,600
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it's not E.T.

1199
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:23,181
[SPEAKER_06]: on the Atari 2600.

1200
01:13:23,221 --> 01:13:26,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we can't actually bury it.

1201
01:13:26,383 --> 01:13:27,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, here we go, here we go.

1202
01:13:27,664 --> 01:13:31,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Yaris sucks, would rather have gone to Kmart.

1203
01:13:32,828 --> 01:13:39,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, um... The sound you hear is a dead horse being beaten over and over again in the studio.

1204
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:44,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, the Mortal Kombat movie is very good.

1205
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:49,521
[SPEAKER_07]: It could make you motion sick, because they have a really long quake sequence in there, and it's, um...

1206
01:13:50,248 --> 01:13:55,409
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of video game graphics running in the background while the interviews are going on.

1207
01:13:55,849 --> 01:14:01,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually, in my opinion, it's too much video game graphics, but they do some really funny transitions.

1208
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:04,051
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's worth a listen.

1209
01:14:04,911 --> 01:14:06,312
[SPEAKER_07]: It leaves the gray area gray.

1210
01:14:09,493 --> 01:14:19,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Jack Thompson and the guy he was sparring against was Lorne Lanning, who helped to co-create Oddworld Inhabitants.

1211
01:14:20,982 --> 01:14:31,727
[SPEAKER_07]: and they were sparring off and Jack was funny and he was civil and, you know, I really hate, you know, I don't have any dirt on him.

1212
01:14:31,987 --> 01:14:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: He was very smart.

1213
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:34,969
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he knew he was in enemy territory.

1214
01:14:35,329 --> 01:14:36,109
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know.

1215
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:41,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he probably went back onto the game politics, put comment forums a couple hours later and started slandering people.

1216
01:14:41,932 --> 01:14:43,313
[SPEAKER_13]: They all smelled like ass.

1217
01:14:44,353 --> 01:14:48,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, his comments on game politics are really like personality too.

1218
01:14:48,355 --> 01:14:48,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1219
01:14:49,196 --> 01:14:49,476
[SPEAKER_12]: So,

1220
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:53,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Rob, we... Oh, yeah, go ahead.

1221
01:14:54,172 --> 01:15:02,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Lorne pretty much lost the interview because he got emotional and he started attacking Jackie Poo's character, which was really a mistake.

1222
01:15:02,936 --> 01:15:03,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.

1223
01:15:03,476 --> 01:15:05,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it doesn't matter who won.

1224
01:15:05,938 --> 01:15:07,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't change my opinion.

1225
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:08,659
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree.

1226
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:09,720
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just one debate.

1227
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,580
[SPEAKER_12]: He may have won the battle, but he hasn't won the war.

1228
01:15:12,601 --> 01:15:15,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And you should have seen they made us go through the security check.

1229
01:15:15,823 --> 01:15:16,643
Yeah.

1230
01:15:18,052 --> 01:15:18,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times.

1231
01:15:18,913 --> 01:15:26,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Rob, we've got to let you go, but we really appreciate the call talking about the VG Expo, which we all forgot happened, so I'm glad somebody was there to remind us, alrighty?

1232
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I only live like 90 minutes from it, so... Nice.

1233
01:15:30,163 --> 01:15:32,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, glad to hear you had a good time, and hope to hear from you in the future.

1234
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:33,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't be a stranger.

1235
01:15:34,227 --> 01:15:34,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, see ya.

1236
01:15:34,928 --> 01:15:35,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care, buddy.

1237
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:43,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel bad because I'm making our callers wrap it up, but, you know, I know there's still a bunch of people that want to call in, so we'll take maybe two more calls?

1238
01:15:45,272 --> 01:15:50,413
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1239
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:51,733
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to give us a call.

1240
01:15:55,874 --> 01:15:58,054
[SPEAKER_12]: I will open it up for some... Oh, never mind, we're getting a call.

1241
01:15:58,995 --> 01:16:00,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1242
01:16:00,175 --> 01:16:00,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1243
01:16:04,455 --> 01:16:05,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1244
01:16:05,856 --> 01:16:06,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1245
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:09,696
[SPEAKER_12]: We cannot hear you.

1246
01:16:09,956 --> 01:16:12,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

1247
01:16:12,617 --> 01:16:12,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Quien es?

1248
01:16:15,188 --> 01:16:16,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you say Guinness?

1249
01:16:16,048 --> 01:16:16,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you plug in my mic?

1250
01:16:17,429 --> 01:16:17,589
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1251
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:19,930
[SPEAKER_12]: The crap is happening.

1252
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:20,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

1253
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:20,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1254
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:20,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1255
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:22,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you not expecting to get through?

1256
01:16:23,991 --> 01:16:25,772
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't plug my mic in.

1257
01:16:26,032 --> 01:16:27,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, good job, DMN.

1258
01:16:27,392 --> 01:16:29,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

1259
01:16:29,453 --> 01:16:30,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hi, DMN.

1260
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:31,894
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind now that we can actually hear you?

1261
01:16:33,194 --> 01:16:42,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually calling in response to one of the long emails Dark Sakura had about Nintendo and ignorance and the Nintendo 64.

1262
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:45,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Goodie, goodie, what do you have to say?

1263
01:16:45,882 --> 01:16:50,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Do any of you have any idea as to why Nintendo is still around?

1264
01:16:51,724 --> 01:16:52,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Mario.

1265
01:16:53,185 --> 01:16:53,465
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1266
01:16:53,765 --> 01:16:54,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Handheld.

1267
01:16:55,006 --> 01:17:00,848
[SPEAKER_06]: No, um, because of their, uh, involvement still in the, um, Hanafuda card business.

1268
01:17:01,668 --> 01:17:03,089
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly it, Jamie.

1269
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,429
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1270
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:04,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Pokemon.

1271
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:04,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Pokemon.

1272
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:05,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1273
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:12,210
[SPEAKER_11]: That game has sold well over 14 to 15 million copies, and that's just the originals alone.

1274
01:17:13,411 --> 01:17:15,693
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the reason why Nintendo's still in business.

1275
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:18,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Had that game not have sold well in America, Nintendo would be kaput.

1276
01:17:21,571 --> 01:17:24,013
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Nintendo 64 tanked.

1277
01:17:25,094 --> 01:17:26,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's all admit that it tanked.

1278
01:17:26,515 --> 01:17:27,675
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't that great a system.

1279
01:17:28,476 --> 01:17:32,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo lost a lot of money on it, and they didn't do that great on the GameCube either.

1280
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:36,542
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just now rebounding back with the DS and the Wii.

1281
01:17:37,543 --> 01:17:44,127
[SPEAKER_11]: So saying that the Nintendo 64 kept it in their form, no.

1282
01:17:44,487 --> 01:17:46,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it have games I personally enjoyed?

1283
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:46,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1284
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,411
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think it was that successful of a system.

1285
01:17:50,256 --> 01:17:53,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob with two B's, our last caller, is back in chat and says, Nintendo sells at profit.

1286
01:17:53,838 --> 01:17:54,819
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why they're still around.

1287
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,020
[SPEAKER_11]: That too.

1288
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:59,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the GameCube from its inception sold profit.

1289
01:17:59,162 --> 01:18:02,224
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii, since its inception, has sold at profit.

1290
01:18:02,304 --> 01:18:06,507
[SPEAKER_11]: The DS, even with both models, has sold at profit.

1291
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:11,950
[SPEAKER_11]: So Nintendo knows what they're doing with hardware.

1292
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:13,451
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why they're still in it.

1293
01:18:13,651 --> 01:18:16,013
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said earlier, Pokemon Snap is the shit.

1294
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:18,735
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, Pokemon for the win.

1295
01:18:18,775 --> 01:18:18,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1296
01:18:20,285 --> 01:18:22,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, DMN?

1297
01:18:26,531 --> 01:18:27,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, man.

1298
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:32,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Guitar Hero 3 massively multiplayer-a-thon that I talked about on my show.

1299
01:18:32,496 --> 01:18:33,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to pitch that really quick.

1300
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:34,478
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this?

1301
01:18:34,618 --> 01:18:43,526
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are an OLR fanboy, listener, on-air talent, get together on Xbox Live or on a Nintendo Wi-Fi connection this Saturday.

1302
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:45,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's November the 9th.

1303
01:18:47,103 --> 01:18:54,505
[SPEAKER_11]: and get together, play with some fellow OLR listeners and have some fun because Guitar Hero 3 is a very fun game especially on multiplayer this time around.

1304
01:18:54,626 --> 01:18:57,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you could join our band on the website.

1305
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,427
[SPEAKER_11]: That too, I did.

1306
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I joined it like just now.

1307
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:01,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I see your request.

1308
01:19:01,648 --> 01:19:03,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go in and approve it right now.

1309
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:07,149
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm working on that right now as we talk.

1310
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:09,410
[SPEAKER_11]: He's clicking on the red X. I am.

1311
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and now I'm going to click on the button that hangs up on you, okay?

1312
01:19:13,511 --> 01:19:14,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1313
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:15,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye, friend.

1314
01:19:15,812 --> 01:19:16,092
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1315
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:17,033
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1316
01:19:35,289 --> 01:19:42,954
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying that since the project started, they've been using 670,000 PlayStation 3s.

1317
01:19:47,217 --> 01:19:56,143
[SPEAKER_06]: According to this, it says the FAH is now the most powerful distributed computing network ever at over a petaflop.

1318
01:19:58,188 --> 01:20:01,709
[SPEAKER_12]: That sounds like something that would be on Dateline NBC, a petaflop.

1319
01:20:01,729 --> 01:20:06,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's over 250 teraflops, which is a trillion calculations per second.

1320
01:20:08,131 --> 01:20:12,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have been using the PS3 as a computer.

1321
01:20:12,552 --> 01:20:25,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole point of the folding project is basically to look how proteins fold because they have evidence to show that proteins that don't fold properly are related to Alzheimer's and other diseases.

1322
01:20:26,236 --> 01:20:26,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1323
01:20:27,736 --> 01:20:30,157
[SPEAKER_12]: The amazing things being accomplished with the PlayStation 3.

1324
01:20:30,517 --> 01:20:30,997
[SPEAKER_12]: What can we say?

1325
01:20:32,058 --> 01:20:34,799
[SPEAKER_12]: And Rob with 2Bs asks in chat, what's a microflop then?

1326
01:20:36,019 --> 01:20:39,081
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be this episode.

1327
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:41,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Good point.

1328
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:42,822
[SPEAKER_12]: We're getting another call on the Skype line.

1329
01:20:42,862 --> 01:20:43,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go take it.

1330
01:20:43,863 --> 01:20:45,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1331
01:20:45,683 --> 01:20:46,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1332
01:20:46,784 --> 01:20:48,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, it's Rice Princess.

1333
01:20:48,504 --> 01:20:49,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Rice Princess.

1334
01:20:49,785 --> 01:20:51,946
[SPEAKER_12]: You're supposed to be here in studio tonight.

1335
01:20:52,446 --> 01:20:53,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally was.

1336
01:20:53,506 --> 01:20:54,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1337
01:20:54,447 --> 01:20:55,027
[SPEAKER_12]: What gives?

1338
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I have a flat tire.

1339
01:20:58,665 --> 01:20:59,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Fired.

1340
01:20:59,845 --> 01:21:00,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1341
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:00,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1342
01:21:00,946 --> 01:21:01,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Too cute.

1343
01:21:02,026 --> 01:21:03,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, what's on your mind?

1344
01:21:03,126 --> 01:21:05,907
[SPEAKER_12]: And put the mic a little closer to your mouth because you're barely coming in.

1345
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:07,448
[SPEAKER_04]: This better?

1346
01:21:07,508 --> 01:21:08,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

1347
01:21:08,288 --> 01:21:09,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it louder?

1348
01:21:09,128 --> 01:21:10,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesus Christ, yes.

1349
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:11,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1350
01:21:12,089 --> 01:21:12,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Much better.

1351
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:13,230
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1352
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,190
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you want to comment on tonight?

1353
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:15,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know.

1354
01:21:15,831 --> 01:21:16,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You told me to call in.

1355
01:21:17,451 --> 01:21:19,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I told you to call in because you weren't here in person.

1356
01:21:19,972 --> 01:21:21,673
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to debrate you over the phone.

1357
01:21:22,313 --> 01:21:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1358
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:23,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Shame on you.

1359
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:25,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what have you been playing lately?

1360
01:21:25,234 --> 01:21:25,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything?

1361
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:30,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been doing much game playing for the past couple weeks.

1362
01:21:32,572 --> 01:21:34,113
[SPEAKER_12]: You haven't been playing a lot of WoW or anything?

1363
01:21:35,234 --> 01:21:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

1364
01:21:36,675 --> 01:21:36,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

1365
01:21:37,435 --> 01:21:41,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, gee, a video game podcast sure does you a lot of good this week, doesn't it?

1366
01:21:41,578 --> 01:21:42,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't it, though?

1367
01:21:42,558 --> 01:21:47,241
[SPEAKER_04]: My gosh, I've been playing so little, like, it's kind of pointless for me to be calling in.

1368
01:21:47,481 --> 01:21:48,742
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, then I'll hang up on you.

1369
01:21:49,622 --> 01:21:49,822
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1370
01:21:50,082 --> 01:21:50,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll hang up on you, then.

1371
01:21:51,403 --> 01:21:53,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, jerk, you told me to call in.

1372
01:21:53,584 --> 01:21:56,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because I thought you'd want to say hi, because you weren't here in person.

1373
01:21:56,642 --> 01:21:57,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, hi.

1374
01:21:57,783 --> 01:21:58,303
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, bye.

1375
01:21:58,924 --> 01:22:01,046
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, 1-877.

1376
01:22:02,307 --> 01:22:04,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to get spanked for that one later.

1377
01:22:04,548 --> 01:22:07,851
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1378
01:22:07,891 --> 01:22:09,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, got anything for us real quick?

1379
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:10,052
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take one more call.

1380
01:22:12,234 --> 01:22:16,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Circuit City is offering a pretty cool deal for people that purchase Call of Duty 4.

1381
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,939
[SPEAKER_14]: You get Call of Duty 3 for free.

1382
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:23,723
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's for... Because you probably already own it.

1383
01:22:24,727 --> 01:22:25,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, it's free.

1384
01:22:25,087 --> 01:22:26,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you wouldn't want to play it.

1385
01:22:27,328 --> 01:22:27,928
[SPEAKER_14]: It's free.

1386
01:22:28,408 --> 01:22:31,129
[SPEAKER_14]: And also been leaked to the internet from what I've seen.

1387
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:38,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Sensible Soccer, or Sensible World of Soccer, is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade this month.

1388
01:22:39,272 --> 01:22:42,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Following, also coming out on the PSC.

1389
01:22:42,673 --> 01:22:44,594
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that's neat.

1390
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:45,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

1391
01:22:45,814 --> 01:22:47,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Except the game is how old?

1392
01:22:47,515 --> 01:22:48,595
[SPEAKER_12]: We're getting another call on Skype.

1393
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:51,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go take that and then we'll get to any more last minute stories.

1394
01:22:51,256 --> 01:22:52,196
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be our last call tonight.

1395
01:22:52,236 --> 01:22:53,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1396
01:22:53,237 --> 01:22:53,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1397
01:22:55,457 --> 01:22:57,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Shadow Next Gen Shadow Next Gen

1398
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:34,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Contra 4, Call of Duty 4, Simpsons, there was Guitar Hero 3, Rock Band, there was quite a lot of games there to play.

1399
01:23:34,656 --> 01:23:41,261
[SPEAKER_12]: The biggest complaint I heard about E4ALL was very similar to what Rob had just said about Video Game Expo, and that is, you could have done it all in a day.

1400
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:42,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that true?

1401
01:23:44,443 --> 01:23:48,245
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably could have, but I mean, I was there for the whole time.

1402
01:23:48,285 --> 01:23:51,667
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also the Video Game Live concert that I went to that was a lot of fun as well.

1403
01:23:51,687 --> 01:23:53,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice, sounds like fun.

1404
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:54,129
[SPEAKER_01]: That was right across the street.

1405
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:55,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Right across the street from E4L.

1406
01:23:56,417 --> 01:23:58,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you wait in line for Super Smash Bros.?

1407
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:03,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have to because I got in early.

1408
01:24:04,161 --> 01:24:04,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.

1409
01:24:04,501 --> 01:24:06,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.

1410
01:24:06,502 --> 01:24:06,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

1411
01:24:06,782 --> 01:24:07,243
[SPEAKER_12]: How was it?

1412
01:24:08,603 --> 01:24:09,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Smash Bros.

1413
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:10,104
[SPEAKER_01]: was a lot of fun.

1414
01:24:10,324 --> 01:24:14,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I was... I believe I played as Link and they had a level from Twilight Princess in there.

1415
01:24:15,987 --> 01:24:20,730
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the bridge level where you're jousting with that big enemy on the Warthog.

1416
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:21,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

1417
01:24:22,806 --> 01:24:23,506
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of fun.

1418
01:24:23,806 --> 01:24:27,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think this game has the potential to be OMG best game ever?

1419
01:24:30,147 --> 01:24:31,728
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the new stuff that they're putting in?

1420
01:24:31,868 --> 01:24:35,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Could very well be with the level editor and the video record feature.

1421
01:24:36,249 --> 01:24:38,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like every week they keep adding new features.

1422
01:24:39,429 --> 01:24:40,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds pretty hot.

1423
01:24:40,129 --> 01:24:41,130
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I'm excited about it.

1424
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:46,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then I got to try the Wii Zapper I actually had fun with.

1425
01:24:47,211 --> 01:24:48,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, yes, the Wii Zapper.

1426
01:24:48,471 --> 01:24:48,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1427
01:24:49,307 --> 01:24:50,828
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be coming out pretty soon, huh?

1428
01:24:51,048 --> 01:24:54,689
[SPEAKER_01]: They have Link's crossbow training there, which was pretty good, especially if you're a Zelda fan.

1429
01:24:55,049 --> 01:25:01,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a copy on order because I've saved myself from purchasing other Wii games, so I'll be getting it.

1430
01:25:01,412 --> 01:25:06,514
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very excited to finally put the Wii Zapper bet to rest, because we still have that going on, too.

1431
01:25:06,554 --> 01:25:07,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I will kick your ass.

1432
01:25:07,274 --> 01:25:07,794
[SPEAKER_12]: The date bet.

1433
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:10,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, we'll worry about that later.

1434
01:25:11,276 --> 01:25:13,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario Party DS was there.

1435
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:14,437
[SPEAKER_01]: That was also a lot of fun.

1436
01:25:14,477 --> 01:25:14,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

1437
01:25:16,634 --> 01:25:19,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, I saw Mario Party 8 this weekend, I forgot to mention.

1438
01:25:20,236 --> 01:25:21,256
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw it, I didn't play it.

1439
01:25:21,376 --> 01:25:23,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was another Wii game that came out at the party.

1440
01:25:23,717 --> 01:25:25,118
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just another Mario Party game.

1441
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:27,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I got it for my brother when I got him his Wii for his birthday.

1442
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:29,640
[SPEAKER_12]: But now you build hotels, I guess, or something.

1443
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:30,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever.

1444
01:25:31,021 --> 01:25:32,781
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the maps has hotels on it, or something.

1445
01:25:33,162 --> 01:25:33,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

1446
01:25:33,982 --> 01:25:34,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Shadow Next Gen.

1447
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:36,083
[SPEAKER_12]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

1448
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:38,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1449
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:44,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say that E4ALL wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of the reports were making it out to be.

1450
01:25:44,593 --> 01:25:46,355
[SPEAKER_01]: They had about 18,000 people there, I think they said.

1451
01:25:49,147 --> 01:25:52,008
[SPEAKER_01]: which is almost about a third of what E3 used to draw.

1452
01:25:52,028 --> 01:25:56,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that's pretty good for a first year without Sony and Microsoft there.

1453
01:25:56,411 --> 01:25:59,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm glad to hear a dissenting opinion from someone who was actually there.

1454
01:25:59,512 --> 01:26:00,212
[SPEAKER_12]: We welcome that.

1455
01:26:00,693 --> 01:26:02,193
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you think, though, about next year?

1456
01:26:02,213 --> 01:26:06,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Because apparently they have it timed where it's going to be very close to Penny Arcade Expo next year.

1457
01:26:06,736 --> 01:26:09,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think that's going to be a good thing or bad or what?

1458
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:17,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I don't really see it being too good of a move because Penny Arcade is starting to get really huge.

1459
01:26:17,501 --> 01:26:17,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

1460
01:26:18,283 --> 01:26:25,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why they would want to draw away more potential exhibitors who would probably rather go up to Seattle.

1461
01:26:27,268 --> 01:26:28,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

1462
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,090
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to wait and see.

1463
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:34,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully they'll smarten up and either they'll put it in October again or they'll put it earlier in the year.

1464
01:26:35,213 --> 01:26:38,955
[SPEAKER_12]: They might be playing a game of chicken right now to see if anybody backs down first, but we will see.

1465
01:26:39,696 --> 01:26:40,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, shout out next time.

1466
01:26:40,356 --> 01:26:41,077
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to let you go.

1467
01:26:41,177 --> 01:26:43,858
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to try to wrap things up for tonight, but thanks so much for your call.

1468
01:26:45,399 --> 01:26:46,160
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, have a good night, guys.

1469
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:46,620
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, you too.

1470
01:26:47,892 --> 01:26:52,395
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good to hear from somebody who's actually there, as opposed to all the hearsay on the internet.

1471
01:26:53,055 --> 01:26:55,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.

1472
01:26:55,156 --> 01:27:03,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we have more people that wanted to call in, but sadly, we've got to get this show wrapped up, because we are going on a three-hour program tonight, and we've got to wrap this shit up.

1473
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:06,963
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Loki, did you have anything else for Last Minute Stories?

1474
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:07,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, real quick.

1475
01:27:08,004 --> 01:27:13,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say, Heavenly Star is going to be in No More Heroes as well, as a song, apparently.

1476
01:27:13,707 --> 01:27:16,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, it should be pretty interesting.

1477
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:16,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess...

1478
01:27:18,393 --> 01:27:21,254
[SPEAKER_14]: You find a hidden VHS tape in the game or something.

1479
01:27:21,855 --> 01:27:22,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's kind of weird.

1480
01:27:24,096 --> 01:27:25,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Then, let's see here.

1481
01:27:26,297 --> 01:27:27,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I laughed when I read this story.

1482
01:27:28,498 --> 01:27:35,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, they were going to do some Assassin's Creed novels that were going to come out around the same time as the game.

1483
01:27:36,721 --> 01:27:43,965
[SPEAKER_14]: But apparently, a sect of real-life assassins paid Ubisoft to visit and told them no.

1484
01:27:46,426 --> 01:27:46,706
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1485
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I laughed at that.

1486
01:27:49,982 --> 01:28:01,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Then there was an interview with Naughty Dog about Uncharted where they said that they've only used 30% of the PS3's power for Uncharted.

1487
01:28:01,353 --> 01:28:03,135
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the game sucks that's why.

1488
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:05,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

1489
01:28:07,641 --> 01:28:19,051
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finally, Nintendo was also, the PR manager with Nintendo was interviewed regarding a couple things, including a hard drive and friend codes.

1490
01:28:19,912 --> 01:28:28,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Eric Walter, of course, revealed no plans for a Wii hard drive, despite the fact that the whole WiiWare service is going to be coming.

1491
01:28:28,939 --> 01:28:33,103
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, as far as the friends codes...

1492
01:28:33,473 --> 01:28:44,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, they've pulled people through different questionnaires and whatnot, and people don't seem to be... They are undisturbed by them, so they're going to stay.

1493
01:28:46,601 --> 01:28:47,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray!

1494
01:28:48,082 --> 01:28:51,464
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to add to the last minute news to follow up to our breaking news earlier.

1495
01:28:52,024 --> 01:28:53,865
[SPEAKER_12]: The character battle is over, and it's official.

1496
01:28:53,985 --> 01:28:57,047
[SPEAKER_12]: El Block is the new champion after the character battle.

1497
01:28:57,687 --> 01:29:00,329
[SPEAKER_12]: And now they're having an extra bonus round.

1498
01:29:01,112 --> 01:29:07,615
[SPEAKER_12]: and today the L Block is facing off against the Paddle, the Question Mark Block, and the Weighted Companion Cube.

1499
01:29:08,536 --> 01:29:09,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, they're all doing battles.

1500
01:29:11,057 --> 01:29:14,098
[SPEAKER_13]: I can already tell the Weighted Companion Cube is going to win just because it's current.

1501
01:29:14,398 --> 01:29:22,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, at the current time, now it is early on in the race, but at the current time, L Block is leading with almost 40% of the vote.

1502
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:25,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Weighted Companion Cube is in second place, but only with 27% of the vote.

1503
01:29:26,404 --> 01:29:26,984
[SPEAKER_12]: That'll change.

1504
01:29:27,064 --> 01:29:29,265
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the portal jokes are going to get old pretty soon, you guys.

1505
01:29:30,126 --> 01:29:30,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1506
01:29:31,573 --> 01:29:33,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, show is over.

1507
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:35,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1508
01:29:35,155 --> 01:29:36,295
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll start off with Puppy.

1509
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:39,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for being here, and I'm glad you got to actually talk this time.

1510
01:29:39,777 --> 01:29:42,299
[SPEAKER_12]: So what is your final thought?

1511
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,961
[SPEAKER_13]: I have cavities now from all that candy.

1512
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:48,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1513
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:49,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I need an insulin shot.

1514
01:29:49,362 --> 01:29:49,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesus.

1515
01:29:50,062 --> 01:29:52,023
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, DarkSakura, your final thought.

1516
01:29:52,524 --> 01:29:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I fucking love my iPhone.

1517
01:29:55,685 --> 01:30:00,728
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is I'm going to have a candy coma.

1518
01:30:01,606 --> 01:30:02,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought?

1519
01:30:03,289 --> 01:30:05,333
[SPEAKER_14]: My final thought is I have way too many games to play this week.

1520
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:06,896
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope my Wii works.

1521
01:30:07,858 --> 01:30:08,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1522
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:09,601
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii console.

1523
01:30:09,801 --> 01:30:10,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys so much.

1524
01:30:10,422 --> 01:30:11,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not worried about my Wii.

1525
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:12,687
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that works just fine.

1526
01:30:13,354 --> 01:30:13,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1527
01:30:14,574 --> 01:30:18,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Independent Radio.

1528
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:32,779
[SPEAKER_12]: If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show or go leave us a nice review on iTunes, dang it, because we could always use some extra five-star reviews because that helps spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.

1529
01:30:32,819 --> 01:30:36,520
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have any of those fancy magazines.

1530
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:37,020
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

1531
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,441
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have any of that fancy schmancy stuff to back us up.

1532
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:41,762
[SPEAKER_12]: We do this because we love you all.

1533
01:30:41,782 --> 01:30:42,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Expensive print material.

1534
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we appreciate it.

1535
01:30:45,102 --> 01:30:48,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Seems like one of those fancy magazines you find at Kmart.

1536
01:30:50,506 --> 01:30:50,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1537
01:30:51,827 --> 01:30:59,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, on that note, until next week, I'm Rob, that's Jamie, that's Loki, and we're Orange Lounge Radio.

1538
01:30:59,374 --> 01:30:59,974
[SPEAKER_12]: See you next week.

1539
01:31:03,918 --> 01:31:07,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

01:31:09,525 --> 01:31:18,903
