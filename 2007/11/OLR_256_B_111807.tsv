0	5700	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5700	11700	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11700	15000	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	25700	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, November the 18th of 2007.
25700	29700	By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast, it'll probably be Thanksgiving time,
29700	34700	so to all of our fellow American listeners, happy Thanksgiving and hope you're having a good day today.
34700	39500	To all of our non-American listeners, happy Thursday whenever that happens to fall for you.
39500	42200	Alright, let's go back into the gaming news.
42200	45700	Loki, happy Thursday from wherever that happens to fall.
45700	49500	Because I'm thinking in my mind Thanksgiving, never mind, I'm out of it tonight.
49500	52200	I think Thursday lands on the same time of the week each week.
52200	55200	Anyways, not when you have the international dateline involved, okay?
55200	58700	It's still the same time each week, their time.
58700	60200	Shut up, I hate you.
60200	64700	So, another reason I guess people are kind of bitter, you know, Club Nintendo,
64700	67200	this wonderful little program that they have in Japan,
67200	71700	where they get a bunch of cool free shit that we don't ever see anywhere else around the world.
71700	74700	Well, they're getting something else that's pretty cool,
74700	78700	a Super Famicom controller that is actually a classic controller.
78700	84200	So you can use this to play your wonderful Super Nintendo or Super Famicom games using the Wii.
84200	88700	And it is authentic, so yeah, you can get that.
88700	93700	Also, other items of note, they have a Mario Galaxy soundtrack,
93700	96700	including 81 tracks from the game across two CDs.
96700	98700	Jesus, 81?
98700	102700	And two 2008 tabletop calendars.
102700	106700	Of course, you know, if you want these, you have to,
106700	110700	you know, you have until December 2nd to select one of the above items.
110700	116200	But anyways, according to IGN's translation of the site,
116200	119700	those Famicom controllers are going to be delivered by April 2008.
119700	122700	But still, though, I think those are pretty cool.
122700	125700	Too bad we don't have anything like that over here.
125700	128700	I know, that's very cool.
128700	130700	Why don't they do that over here, you think?
130700	134700	Is it just a money thing? Too many people would get in on it or what?
134700	137700	Why can't they just do like a contest or something silly?
137700	139700	I don't know. They don't like us?
139700	140700	I guess.
140700	145700	Well, God, we buy their freaking Wii's even though they haven't put out that many games this year to support it.
145700	147700	We've stood by them.
147700	149700	We should get something out of it, don't you think?
149700	150700	Nope.
150700	153700	I guess not, jerks.
153700	159700	Alright, well, I'll just continue to play the Virtual Console games with the thing they have out there.
159700	165700	Well, remember how we said in Part A that usually if peripherals only get like one game to go with them,
165700	168700	then they won't continue to be supported and they'll be pretty much deemed a failure?
168700	173700	Well, what's interesting is that there do appear to be some other games coming on board with an upcoming peripheral,
173700	176700	and that is the Wii Balance Board.
176700	179700	It's coming out, I believe, early next year with Wii Fitness.
179700	182700	A new game has been announced that will use the Wii Balance Board.
182700	185700	It's Namco Bandai's Family Ski.
185700	190700	Famitsu has recently revealed this game and it will be compatible with the Wii Balance Board.
190700	192700	Notice that's compatible, not required,
192700	197700	but certainly it does look like you'll get to use, you know, Mii-like characters in the game.
197700	198700	For your own Mii's.
198700	200700	With skiing.
200700	205700	The game is supposedly going to come out winter of this year or 2008 even in Japan.
205700	210700	So kind of interesting the game may actually be out in Japan before the Wii Fit board actually is out.
210700	212700	So, kind of cool.
212700	217700	Kind of like how we have DualShock 3 support for PlayStation 3 games over here.
217700	220700	Even though the controllers don't come out until the spring.
220700	222700	Yeah.
222700	224700	Odd1InChat says, oh man.
224700	227700	By the way, chat.orangemonstrator.com, we always love our chatters.
227700	229700	The ever-present fourth host on our show.
229700	234700	Odd1 says, oh man, the Wii Balance Board is going to be the best way to randomly tackle friends and loved ones ever.
234700	236700	What?
236700	238700	That might be kind of scary, I don't know.
238700	245700	I was going to say that they're also going to have a game in Wii Fit that's going to be a skiing or snowboarding game
245700	247700	that's going to use the Balance Board as well.
247700	250700	So wait, are we just going to see a lot of knock-offs of those type of games?
250700	252700	Kind of like we've been seeing in Wii Sports.
252700	257700	Suddenly there's all these golf games and, you know, tennis games.
257700	261700	Well, it's just like when Wii Play came out, hey, we can do shooting gallery type games in this?
261700	263700	Okay, let's make a bunch of them.
263700	265700	They all suck.
265700	267700	Yay.
267700	274700	Hey, there's nothing wrong with another skiing game using it because it's going to be a full fleshed out version of skiing.
274700	281700	Now, Namco Bandai is a pretty respected third-party publisher that's not known for doing a lot of these type of knock-off games.
281700	285700	Now, certain third-party publishers are kind of known for being nothing but a bunch of knock-off games.
285700	291700	It's not really Namco Bandai unless they're knocking themselves off or ripping themselves off with Katamari.
291700	295700	But you know what I mean.
295700	297700	I think the game will be fine.
297700	302700	Well, this is actually something else I think a lot of people are looking forward to on Wii.
302700	305700	Okami will be on Wii.
305700	314700	And it will, excuse me, that wasn't fun.
314700	325700	But basically, for the folks at Capcom, they had actually been asked if Okami was going to have a Wii release before the PS2 version even came out.
325700	327700	So they were already thinking about it.
327700	332700	And so they're going to bring it out.
332700	336700	That's one of those games I always wanted to play but I just kind of missed when it first came out.
336700	340700	So this will give me an opportunity to rediscover it all over again on the Wii.
340700	351700	Well, they're also going to be doing a few little tweaks to the game, some gameplay touches, and it will be 16 to 9 ratio.
351700	352700	Oh, now that's cool.
352700	355700	That's right, because the original game wasn't widescreen, so very nice.
355700	357700	And Wii like widescreen.
357700	358700	Absolutely.
358700	360700	Especially me, since I have a TV.
360700	365700	And you know those TVs are going to be more and more out there as this Christmas goes on.
365700	370700	Because that should be a big seller this year now that HD TVs are getting more and more affordable.
370700	372700	I think you're going to see more and more houses have those.
372700	380700	So it will be kind of interesting to see the gaming scene kind of have to evolve to catch up with that and all the games supporting widescreen.
380700	382700	We're looking at you, Nintendo.
382700	383700	That's right.
383700	386700	And your 480p HD.
386700	395700	Well, if you're looking for some Nintendo Wiis, Nintendo is churning out 1.8 million Wiis per month.
395700	397700	Of course, that is split up worldwide.
397700	400700	And will continue to do so until the drought is over.
400700	402700	Yay!
402700	404700	What does that mean, though?
404700	406700	Will you see more Wiis in the stores?
406700	407700	Probably not.
407700	412700	It means no price drop and no new colors, because the ones that are already out there are selling.
412700	414700	Yay!
414700	417700	Wait.
417700	418700	No price drop.
418700	422700	I don't think you need a price drop yet, unless your system is, like, sucking.
422700	424700	That's when you start dropping the price of your system.
424700	429700	Drunami in Chat says beatings will continue until morale improves.
429700	431700	Yay!
431700	434700	Coming out for a play soon on those Wiis.
434700	437700	Skate or Die is coming out on the virtual console.
437700	439700	I love Skate or Die!
439700	448700	It's on its way to the Australian virtual console, but surely if it's coming to Australia, it must be coming to other regions soon, right?
448700	453700	The way we know it's coming to Australia, because just like things get spoiled by the ESRB over here,
453700	461700	the Office of Film and Literature Classifications database showed a re-rating of Skate or Die for the virtual console.
461700	462700	Awesome.
462700	466700	And I know over here we're getting Air Zonk on Monday, or Super Air Zonk.
466700	468700	How did you find that out?
468700	469700	Did you have Wiis?
469700	474700	No, actually, because they announced it on, I believe, the TurboGrafx-
474700	477700	There's some, like, TurboGrafx-16 site that lists a bunch of this crap.
477700	478700	Nice.
478700	479700	It was officially announced, so.
479700	481700	I think we should get that and Skate or Die here.
481700	482700	That would be an awesome week.
482700	484700	Hudson, I'm sure, did it.
484700	487700	What do you think they'll give us for Christmas on a virtual console?
487700	490700	I mean, they could give me Guardian Legend, but I somehow don't think that would happen.
490700	492700	I don't know. Have they made a Shrek game on the Super Nintendo?
492700	494700	Oh, no, I don't think so.
494700	495700	You know what I want?
495700	496700	What?
496700	497700	Kirby's Avalanche.
497700	501700	Isn't that- get Dr. Bean Machine or whatever.
501700	504700	But it actually plays differently on the Super Nintendo.
504700	505700	That'd be pretty funny.
505700	507700	I'm a whore for Puyo Puyo.
507700	509700	Wait, I want to say Kirby's Avalanche is out there.
509700	511700	I'm getting it mixed up with a golf game.
511700	514700	They should have, well, maybe kind of find 1080.
514700	515700	Remember that?
515700	517700	What about 720?
517700	521700	Fuck 720. 1080 was a snowboarding game.
521700	523700	I know, but 720 was a skateboarding game. What's your point?
523700	525700	It wasn't a very good skateboarding game.
525700	526700	It was an awesome skateboarding game!
526700	527700	Oh, yeah.
527700	529700	You got killed by bees.
529700	530700	Oh, okay.
530700	531700	That's awesome.
531700	532700	That makes it all better.
532700	533700	Yes, it does.
533700	535700	It's got bees in it now, so.
535700	538700	Okay, Act F says Kirby's Avalanche is already on the Virtual Console.
538700	539700	You missed it.
539700	540700	I didn't see it.
540700	541700	You were sleeping that day.
541700	544700	This is what I get for not playing my Wii for, you know, two weeks.
544700	546700	So Act F says both those games are out.
546700	547700	Kirby's Dream Course.
547700	548700	But you know what?
548700	551700	I don't really look at a lot of them so much because I actually have Kirby's Avalanche
551700	555700	and a Super Nintendo, but I still kind of want to play it on my Wii.
555700	556700	Well, there you have it.
556700	558700	Christmas comes early for you this year.
558700	559700	Yay!
559700	560700	But no, I want Guardian Legend.
560700	565700	And if they're doing Sega games, then I freaking want Fantasy Zone.
565700	568700	Oh, that would be kind of cool.
568700	569700	Fantasy Zone.
569700	573700	Because the Genesis, all you needed was the Power Base Converter to play Master System
573700	574700	games on it so it could do it.
574700	578700	You know what game they'll probably give us for Christmas?
578700	582700	Huge selling Nintendo game that Nintendo made.
582700	588460	Big court battle over the rights to the game because somebody else put an off-color version
588460	591700	of it out first, and then Nintendo put a subpar version out themselves.
591700	594700	I bet you you'll see Tetris on Christmas.
594700	595700	I bet you anything.
595700	597700	They should do the Tengen Collection.
597700	600700	I somehow doubt that.
600700	604700	Yeah, Color Dreams games showing up on my Wii, I would set fire to my Wii.
604700	606700	Okay, those games were ass.
606700	609700	But Tengen Tetris was so much better.
609700	610700	That game was cool.
610700	611700	I'll give you that.
611700	612700	I wouldn't mind them so much.
612700	614700	Those are just basically Atari games, like Klax.
614700	615700	Those games were cool.
615700	616700	Kicks.
616700	619700	But the Color Dreams games were also like non-licensed games.
619700	620700	I know.
620700	621700	They were ass.
621700	623700	Those games were horrible.
623700	625700	You know actually what game I wouldn't mind?
625700	630700	Oh shoot, it was on Super Nintendo, but I used to play it in the arcade all the time.
630700	632700	It was a caveman game.
632700	633700	Trog.
633700	634700	Really?
634700	635700	Do you remember that one?
635700	636700	No.
636700	637700	That was a weird game.
637700	638700	I do not.
638700	640700	Alright, well moving on with other virtual console news.
640700	642700	One game in the UK.
642700	644700	One game.
644700	645700	Double Dribble.
645700	647700	At least it's one fucking good game.
647700	648700	Yeah.
648700	650700	Double Dribble is pretty good.
650700	654700	You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but I did play a shitload of Double Dribble.
654700	658700	And NBA Jam was like the all-time greatest basketball game is NBA Jam.
658700	662700	Did you ever play any of the arcade NBA Jams that had the Mortal Kombat hacks?
662700	663700	Of course.
663700	664700	Of course.
664700	666700	The Scorpion is an unlocked character, absolutely.
666700	670700	And you could play as the president.
670700	672700	Anyway, how did a Double Dribble story turn into an NBA Jam?
672700	673700	Because you said NBA Jam.
673700	674700	Yeah, I know.
674700	675700	Your fault, Rob.
675700	676700	Haha.
676700	677700	Tangent.
677700	678700	Uh-huh.
678700	679700	Uh-huh.
679700	680700	Anyways.
680700	686700	So, if you're not into Double Dribble, maybe you're into betting.
686700	689700	And of course, coming to Super Smash Bros.
689700	692700	Can I bet on Double Dribble games?
692700	694700	No.
694700	699700	Coming to Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a spectator mode, and they will have online betting.
699700	700700	Ooh!
700700	702700	Nintendo is encouraging gambling.
702700	703700	Oh my God.
703700	710700	Send out all those stupid parent groups or whatever.
710700	712700	Let's ban the game now.
712700	715700	It'll get your children knocked up as well.
715700	719700	Isn't spectator mode kind of stupid, though, because you don't know who you're watching?
719700	720700	Maybe.
720700	724700	Like you're watching Player 1 and Player 2, you don't see their names because there's
724700	730700	no centralized service like Xbox Live to protect the children from going into spectator mode
730700	736700	and seeing some guy's name as Cock Wrangler or something is their screen name on Nintendo.
736700	737700	I don't know.
737700	742700	Something that the filters don't pick up because they spell it C-A-W-K or whatever.
742700	745700	Mommy, I bet on Cock Wrangler.
745700	747700	Always bet on Cock Wrangler.
747700	752700	But at least I think if the person is on your friends list, you should be able to see their
752700	753700	name, right?
753700	754700	Maybe.
754700	755700	I don't know.
755700	759700	Anyways, it will allow you to observe, of course, players' battles, including the betting
759700	765700	system, where you can use your hard-earned coins to wage your own combatants during Brawl
765700	768700	battles, and winning can pay off big.
768700	771700	Of course, you can also earn stickers.
771700	772700	Hooray!
772700	773700	Stickers!
773700	776700	Like real stickers or like in-game stickers?
776700	777700	Not real stickers.
777700	778700	Well, tough.
778700	783700	You don't get real stickers.
783700	787700	And of course, I don't know.
787700	792700	It sounds neat, I guess, but once again, I have a feeling that people are going to be
792700	794700	like, hey, you can bet money on it.
794700	797700	I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.
797700	801700	I wonder if you're going to get people throwing matches and stuff.
801700	803700	Like this big underground scheme?
803700	806700	No, you can't because you don't know who's playing in it.
806700	809700	I don't know.
809700	813700	Odd1 says all games should have a mechanic by which they mail you stickers.
813700	816700	I don't care if they're not related to the game, I also want stickers.
816700	821700	So, are you suggesting we go back to the Activision patch system that they had?
821700	822700	Absolutely.
822700	827700	I mean, if you think about it, Xbox Live achievements are indirectly inspired by the old Activision
827700	828700	patch thing.
828700	830700	You know what I think they should do?
830700	831700	Oh, Activision.
831700	833700	Please tell me someone from Activision is listening.
833700	835700	Here's a fabulous idea.
835700	840700	Put all those old Activision games together yet again in one of those bundles, but have
840700	843700	the achievements be the old patches you used to get.
843700	846700	Like, you know, when you would get so many points in a game, then you could unlock the
846700	848700	little picture of that patch.
848700	849700	That might be kind of cool.
849700	853700	Even though we've seen those Activision packs like a million times for different consoles
853700	857700	or whatever, I think one more would be kind of cool if for nothing else but that.
857700	859700	And maybe put some Xbox Live in it.
859700	860700	There you have it.
860700	861700	Put an oink in it for God's sake.
861700	862700	Oink was awesome.
862700	863700	Sorry.
863700	864700	Rant.
864700	865700	Oink.
865700	874700	Guess what store is promising Wii's?
874700	878700	It actually was supposed to happen this weekend in time for the holiday season.
878700	881700	The low, low price of $399 for a bundle.
881700	883700	It's a whole bundle for it.
883700	885700	You would never guess what store would have this.
885700	889700	TJ Maxx is selling an ultimate Wii bundle.
889700	895700	Now, for those that don't know this store, TJ Maxx, I used to live right next to one,
895700	900700	and it's basically just like Ross Dress for Less, but like one step above it.
900700	903700	I don't think it's a step above.
903700	906700	Yeah, I think it's really on the same tier as Ross Dress for Less.
906700	909700	So how TJ Maxx got Wii bundles is beyond me.
909700	911700	That's what makes this story funny for those that don't understand.
911700	912700	I don't know.
912700	913700	Is TJ Maxx nationwide?
913700	915700	Yeah, we had him in Mobile.
915700	916700	Oh, okay.
916700	917700	Then they're pretty nationwide.
917700	918700	They have him here.
918700	919700	It was really ghetto.
919700	920700	Or maybe those overseas.
920700	924700	It's like, it's definitely not Macy's.
924700	925700	We'll put it that way.
925700	928700	It's definitely not a designer clothes place.
928700	930700	It's cheap.
930700	933700	It's kind of like buying your clothes at Walmart.
933700	935700	But even Walmart at least is cheap.
935700	936700	I bought cute stuff at Walmart.
936700	938700	Yeah, Walmart at least is cheap.
938700	940700	It's like buying your clothes at Kmart.
940700	941700	Yes, there you go.
941700	945700	Because Kmart, you can find stuff that was still ugly in the 80s.
945700	947700	And I'm not joking.
947700	948700	Yeah.
948700	949700	Yeah.
949700	951700	TJ Maxx is an interesting place.
951700	955700	So, that's why this story is so humorous for those that maybe don't have it.
955700	956700	I don't know.
956700	959700	By the way, that will only be featured in selected stores only.
959700	962700	And yes, you have to buy the whole goddamn thing as a bundle.
962700	965700	It's the Wii System and 15 accessories.
965700	966700	Which I'm sure is a bunch of crap.
966700	967700	Yeah.
967700	968700	That you don't need.
968700	972700	I hope you like golf attachments and tennis racket attachments.
972700	975700	And the potato chip holder that will also hold your Wiimote.
975700	977700	At least that because it sucks.
977700	978700	God damn it.
978700	979700	That thing actually looked kind of cool.
979700	980700	Just buy a damn bowl.
980700	981700	No.
981700	982700	To put your chips in.
982700	983700	You don't need a fucking little thing.
983700	990700	How about we cleanse the pallet with the undead.
990700	991700	Okay.
991700	992700	Zombies are great.
992700	993700	I love the undead.
993700	995700	I mean loathe the undead.
995700	996700	I know.
996700	999700	Let's turn zombies loose in TJ Maxx.
999700	1003700	I would totally, totally film that and sell it as a movie.
1003700	1004700	There you go.
1004700	1009700	Anyway, for those of us who love the undead.
1009700	1011700	Who dig their zombies.
1011700	1015700	House of the Dead 2 and 3 are going to be on Wii.
1015700	1017700	Using the Wii Zapper.
1017700	1021700	And you can shoot your zombies in the head.
1021700	1025700	But you don't have to press A.
1025700	1026700	Fuck House of the Dead.
1026700	1028700	I want typing of the dead on Wii.
1028700	1030700	Now that they support USB keyboards.
1030700	1031700	Oh that's true, that's true.
1031700	1034700	They put out that patch a while back and now they support the USB keyboards.
1034700	1037700	But I love House of the Dead.
1037700	1039700	And I love Typing of the Dead.
1039700	1040700	You don't even know.
1040700	1043700	But I had House of the Dead 2 on Dreamcast.
1043700	1044700	That was freaking sweet.
1044700	1046700	I have Typing of the Dead on GameTap.
1046700	1047700	I have Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast.
1047700	1050700	I think I might as well.
1050700	1052700	This new pack is actually kind of neat.
1052700	1058700	I'm seeing Sega releasing some of these gun games and hopefully they'll release more because
1058700	1060700	I know with Ghost Squad they started that off.
1060700	1062700	Of course you can use the Wii Zapper.
1062700	1066700	The other thing which no one else has really mentioned so far other than the fact that
1066700	1070700	it's coming out in March is that it's also going to be priced the same as Ghost Squad
1070700	1072700	which is $29.99 retail.
1072700	1078700	So you may be thinking, oh hey, 50 bucks for games that don't look that great on the Wii.
1078700	1082700	It's only 30 bucks and it's actually a pretty good collection and hopefully it's as good
1082700	1085700	as Ghost Squad because Ghost Squad is pretty fun and I think a lot of people are going
1085700	1086700	to overlook it.
1086700	1089700	And it's zombies being shot in the face by your Wiimote.
1089700	1090700	I mean that is kind of cool.
1090700	1093700	I love shooting zombies.
1093700	1098700	And look at it this way, it's not the movie.
1098700	1100700	Just zombies are great, okay?
1100700	1101700	Zombies are great.
1101700	1104700	That's right, zombies are great.
1104700	1109700	Anyways, so another thing that you're going to probably be pissed off about, especially
1109700	1116700	if you just bought a DS, is that there's a rumor saying that there's another DS redesign
1116700	1118700	coming your way.
1118700	1123700	In fact, it's supposed to happen after the holiday sales kind of die out, probably next
1123700	1129700	spring, which is kind of interesting because spring is when they release the last revision,
1129700	1131700	the DS Lite.
1131700	1133700	The rumor is that it's thinner.
1133700	1135700	It's not going to have a Game Boy Advance port.
1135700	1141700	It will have onboard storage and larger screens.
1141700	1145700	And you know that onboard storage is going to then be used by all the cool games that
1145700	1148700	come out next so everybody has to upgrade to one of these things.
1148700	1149700	You know what?
1149700	1155700	Nintendo, I just bought this fucking thing like three months ago and already you're thinking
1155700	1156700	about making me upgrade.
1156700	1157700	You bastards.
1157700	1161700	I just bought a DS Lite myself too so I don't have to play my wife's pink one.
1161700	1163700	I bought a nice black one.
1163700	1164700	Haven't played anything on it though yet.
1164700	1166700	I still have my white one and I like it.
1166700	1170700	But remember, I had to get a pink Advance back in the day.
1170700	1173700	Now people in the chat room are screaming rumor, rumor, rumor.
1173700	1176700	Yes, it's a rumor but honestly, would it surprise you?
1176700	1177700	I mean really, think about it.
1177700	1179700	Look at Nintendo's track record.
1179700	1182700	I mean, do you see why this is popping up everywhere?
1182700	1185700	I mean, it definitely sounds true to me.
1185700	1188700	How many times did they get you to buy the Game Boy?
1188700	1189700	Seriously?
1189700	1190700	How many times?
1190700	1191700	What?
1191700	1192700	Six?
1192700	1193700	Seven?
1193700	1194700	Eight?
1194700	1195700	It's true.
1195700	1196700	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1196700	1197700	Game Boy.
1197700	1198700	Game Boy Pocket.
1198700	1199700	Game Boy Color.
1199700	1200700	You know, the Game Boy Color Pocket.
1200700	1205700	Game Boy Color Pocket with cute little Pikachu things that light up when you turn it on.
1205700	1206700	You know, and so on and so on.
1206700	1208700	The Game Boy Player.
1208700	1209700	That was.
1209700	1210700	Yes, Super Game Boy.
1210700	1211700	Super Game Boy.
1211700	1215700	I have one of those.
1215700	1216700	The Game Boy Advance.
1216700	1217700	The Game Boy Advance.
1217700	1218700	Never fails.
1218700	1219700	SP.
1219700	1220700	The DS.
1220700	1221700	The DS Lite.
1221700	1222700	I have all of those too.
1222700	1224700	And now one more.
1224700	1225700	DS.
1225700	1227700	Whatever they're going to call this thing.
1227700	1228700	DS Slim and Lite.
1228700	1231700	They'll call it the DS Uber.
1231700	1235700	DS Rape, because that's what I keep feeling from making those.
1235700	1236700	Super DS.
1236700	1237700	I don't know.
1237700	1238700	Tiger Claw.
1238700	1242700	Oh yes, Tiger Claw says the next version of the DS will probably be the DS Micro.
1242700	1244700	And of course, the Advance Micro.
1244700	1245700	I have a Game Boy Micro.
1245700	1248700	You're probably the only person I know that has a Game Boy Micro.
1248700	1251700	And I didn't pay for it either.
1251700	1253700	We're still selling those at work.
1253700	1258700	Or should I say, we still have the same 10 that we've had since the Game Boy Micro came
1258700	1259700	out.
1259700	1262700	I would say there's a handheld system by Nintendo that didn't prove to be very popular.
1262700	1263700	It was the Micro.
1263700	1267700	Well, I remember when we saw it at E3, I'm like, that's the dumbest idea I've ever seen.
1267700	1272700	I'm like, what are the best games on Game Boy Advance right now?
1272700	1274700	All the Final Fantasy games being remade.
1274700	1277700	I'm sorry, I'm not going to play that stuff on a freaking Game Boy Micro.
1277700	1280700	Like, Jamie's Puzzle Fighter, I could see that, because the gems are picking up.
1280700	1281700	But it's got interchangeable fails.
1281700	1284700	I tried playing Kingdom Hearts on it, and that did not work.
1284700	1285700	Oh my god, I couldn't read.
1285700	1288700	You know, even worse is playing a shooter on that damn thing.
1288700	1290700	It doesn't happen.
1290700	1294700	You do not play a shooter on the Micro.
1294700	1299700	Do you remember back in the day on the old school Game Boys, they used to have the magnify
1299700	1303700	and light things that you could put on top of them, these really hideous things.
1303700	1304700	But they worked.
1304700	1307700	They would slightly magnify the screen and light AI, and you'd totally get a headache.
1307700	1310700	They need that for the Micro, like a magnify thing.
1310700	1313700	Would that kind of defeat the purpose of buying a Micro in the first place?
1313700	1314700	You know people would buy it.
1314700	1316700	Because they're dumb, right?
1316700	1318700	There you have it.
1318700	1322700	Well, anyway, you would think the FUs of the Week would come after a heated discussion like that,
1322700	1323700	but not so!
1323700	1328700	We have something to trump that, to get your blood boiling just in time for the FUs of the Week.
1328700	1331700	And it has to do with our friends over at Microsoft.
1331700	1336700	Now, it's not Microsoft's fault, but Microsoft was hit with a class action lawsuit.
1336700	1338700	Do you know why?
1338700	1345700	Because there was a man in Georgia that said that Microsoft improperly allowed his underage kid
1345700	1353700	to use his debit card to subscribe to Xbox Live and automatically renew the subscription without authorization.
1353700	1359700	He says that in October 2005, this is being done by Francisco Garcia in Georgia,
1359700	1368700	and he says that in October 2005, his son, Silvario, used his debit card to buy a $50 one-year subscription to Xbox Live.
1368700	1374700	A year later, Microsoft automatically billed him for an additional year of Xbox Live without his knowledge or consent.
1374700	1382700	And he says that the charge sent his checking account into overdraft and that the bank slapped him with a $35 penalty.
1382700	1389700	This is why you should be careful when using your debit card as a credit card, but never mind.
1389700	1397700	And then the plaintiff goes on to say that Microsoft refunded the subscription fee, but would not cover the bank penalty.
1397700	1401700	And he says by accepting a subscription from a minor and automatically renewing it without consent,
1401700	1407700	Microsoft, quote, fraudulently induced a contractual relationship for Xbox Live services.
1407700	1412700	It actually would be a son that committed fraud because a son would have had to put it in his father's name for it to go through.
1412700	1419700	Nowhere is it said how in the hell the kid got the debit card in the first place.
1419700	1421700	But I guess that's not important.
1421700	1430700	Garcia goes on to say that Microsoft broke Georgia law when it allowed his kid to use a debit card to sign up for Xbox Live
1430700	1434700	and then continued to break the law when it renewed the service without written authorization.
1434700	1442700	He's speaking unspecified damages and asking the court to broaden the case to include all Xbox Live customers in Georgia with similar problems.
1442700	1447700	So in other words, kids that steal their dad's wallet and use the cards to buy things.
1447700	1451700	It's not Xbox's fault.
1451700	1457700	In fact, I've seen how hefty the authorization process is to that because I couldn't use my debit card.
1457700	1461700	I had to use one of my other credit cards to run it through.
1461700	1465700	So first of all, they're very specific on putting in the information.
1465700	1469700	You have to have the complete billing information for the person who owns the card.
1469700	1474700	Therefore, it is not Microsoft's fault.
1474700	1479700	It's first of all that guy's fault for letting his kid be able to get into his wallet so easily.
1479700	1483700	And second of all, it's the kid's issue for basically committing fraud.
1483700	1485700	Oh, but yet there's more.
1485700	1488700	Actually, technically that's borderline non-identity theft.
1488700	1490700	Oh, you want to hear about the kid committing fraud?
1490700	1492700	Here's more. Here's more, Jamie.
1492700	1505700	Microsoft has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, saying that they have paperwork that proves that the child misrepresented his age when he subscribed to Xbox Live by falsely stating that he was 18 years old.
1505700	1507700	Uh-huh.
1507700	1513700	Well, even though he would have had to have done it under his parents' name for it to have gone through.
1513700	1515700	It's...
1515700	1517700	What's the chat room saying?
1517700	1523700	Dark Tetsuya says, never mind credit card. This is why condoms were invented.
1523700	1525700	That is brilliant.
1525700	1527700	Our Chatter of the Week, everybody. Dark Tetsuya.
1527700	1529700	Everybody, round of applause. Thank you.
1529700	1530700	Hurray.
1530700	1532700	Loki, no comments?
1532700	1533700	That's just an idiot.
1533700	1534700	I mean, seriously.
1534700	1539700	He didn't notice the charge, you know, was on his credit card in the first place, and then it rebuilt itself, you know.
1539700	1540700	Well, seriously.
1540700	1542700	I mean, how do you do something like that?
1542700	1551700	This is funny, though, because this must have been on an original Xbox account, because now, if your account runs out, all that happens is it turns into silver again.
1551700	1552700	Exactly.
1552700	1554700	It doesn't have an auto-renew option. You have to renew it.
1554700	1555700	There is no auto-renew.
1555700	1556700	Yeah, so...
1556700	1560700	That auto-renew thing was kind of shady, though, the way they used to do it.
1560700	1562700	But that's why you've got to be careful when you use...
1562700	1564700	That's probably why they don't do it anymore.
1564700	1565700	Yeah, that's probably why.
1565700	1566700	But that's why you've got to be careful.
1566700	1573700	I think a lot of people use, and I'm guilty of this, too, to some extent, but I use my debit card for everything that you probably should use a credit card for, you know what I mean?
1573700	1588700	And the guy complaining about how overdrafting his bank account or whatever, that I find to be kind of BS, because if that's the case, then you shouldn't have used it in the first place, or let your kid steal it in the first place and put it on there and then not do anything about it the first time.
1588700	1591700	I mean, a year went by between.
1591700	1593700	I don't think this case has a chance to happen.
1593700	1598700	It's not Microsoft's fault that your bank account was so low that you overdrafted, so you know what?
1598700	1613700	If you didn't want to overdraft, use a real credit card that would have denied it if it was going to hit your limit, although I kind of agree the bank should have denied the charge, but at the same time, this is how banks make money off of people who overdraft. Let's face it, that's one huge way they make money.
1613700	1629700	On top of that, there's often times where a bank will write off an overdraft charge if it was erroneous, if it can be proven, so it's just really a case of this man in Georgia being a complete and utter moron. End of story.
1629700	1634700	You deserve that $35 charge, dumbass.
1634700	1656700	And that being said, obviously stories like this make us very angry, and you know what that means? It's F.U. time.
1656700	1679700	I have a two-part F.U. The first F.U. goes towards this man in the black Toyota truck who pulled out of the gas station and into my lane and cut me off. You're a stupid piece of shit, and you totally deserve to have that cop car pull you over.
1679700	1689700	All right, Loki. Oh, it's two-part, I'm sorry. I thought you said that was mine, and then I was like, okay.
1689700	1692700	Okay, well, that's okay. I'll be nice.
1692700	1693700	You sure?
1693700	1694700	Yes.
1694700	1698700	All right, and I guess the two-part is F.U. Rob. Well, F.U. Jamie, how's that? Cutting in front of Loki.
1698700	1699700	Your mom.
1699700	1700700	F.U. Jamie, your mom.
1700700	1701700	Last night.
1701700	1722700	Loki, I don't have much to be angry about, but I am annoyed at the Priuses that were driving in front of me today. Apparently, owning a Prius means you drive slow. So, screw you Prius owners, and I don't give a shit if you're helping the environment. You're not helping the environment because you're making me late. Or late-er.
1722700	1732700	F.U. to the macaroni and cheese pizza at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza because that shit was nasty. Well, dude, the macaroni and cheese pizza was nasty.
1732700	1740700	The peanut butter pizza was kind of weird. I like the peanut butter pizza, too. But the best was the barbecue chicken.
1740700	1745700	The barbecue chicken at Alfredo was okay. It makes the incredibly shitty pizza not that shitty.
1745700	1747700	I like the macaroni and cheese pizza, though.
1747700	1749700	Yeah, you're weird. F.U. to Jamie twice.
1749700	1753700	Yeah, well, F.U. back to your-
1753700	1754700	F.U. infinity plus one.
1754700	1758700	Yeah, you can't add plus one to infinity because infinity is already infinity.
1758700	1759700	Well, I just did.
1759700	1760700	Well, then you created-
1760700	1767700	What are you going to do? Tell God to smite me?
1767700	1769700	Sometimes the chat room just needs to be here.
1769700	1775700	That silence, by the way, was Jamie actually praying. I know that was great radio, boys and girls, but there you have it.
1775700	1780700	I want to point out, though, real quick about some of the previous stories.
1780700	1785700	GS68 had a great comment about the whole father and the kid thing.
1785700	1794700	The father should cut his credit card and stab his kid with one of his sharp edges.
1794700	1798700	I don't know. I almost think GS68 might have just taken the crown of Chatter of the Week.
1798700	1803700	We might have to have a good old fight over this.
1803700	1819700	Anyways, I don't know if this is good or not, but Atari, the CEO, has resigned and the company has exited game development, which is fine because can you really think of the last good thing to come out of Atari?
1819700	1821700	I know I can't.
1821700	1822700	The Atari 5200?
1822700	1828700	I guess the Test Drive series, but they don't really- I don't know if they're still publishing that. I guess they did.
1828700	1830700	Yes, Test Drive. There you have it.
1830700	1833700	Test Drive. Okay, fine. That's the only thing, but whatever.
1833700	1835700	Flashback consoles.
1835700	1837700	Oh, okay.
1837700	1844700	But anyways, what, they had such wonderful series that they sold off to Ubisoft Driver. Oh, that was awesome.
1844700	1849700	Such a wonderful game. It had no flaws at all. Oh, wait. No, I'm sorry.
1849700	1852700	Stuntman. That was okay.
1852700	1864700	But anyways, so yeah, the Test Drive series has been now licensed to Infogrames, which had, if I remember correctly, didn't they have the really cool theme song that they made for their company?
1864700	1869700	I'm sorry, it wasn't cool at all, but it was a theme song for their company.
1869700	1878700	You know how I knew Atari was going downhill about 15 years ago? Did you ever play a game in the arcades called Pit Fighter?
1878700	1881700	I remember Pit Fighter. It was-
1881700	1884700	I think this game was Atari, yes?
1884700	1888700	No, I don't think it was Atari. Was it Atari?
1888700	1889700	It sucked.
1889700	1895700	But it was a Mortal Kombat digitized type game.
1895700	1902700	It's also one of the worst goddamn video games I've ever played in my entire freaking life. I mean, it's horrid. It is a horrid game.
1902700	1912700	Well, remember we mentioned, I think it was last week or the week before last, about Atari's big games that are coming out? What, the Alone in the Dark series?
1912700	1921700	There's Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 3, and then there's such wonderful titles like Godzilla Unleashed and Jenga.
1921700	1925700	Yay, Jenga. Who thought that was a good idea?
1925700	1933700	Odd1 says, Pit Fighter for Super Nintendo, proof that I was stupid as a child.
1933700	1936700	It's okay, Odd1.
1936700	1939700	Seriously, Jenga, what the hell were you thinking?
1939700	1945700	I mean, it's hard enough to play the game as it is, but, oh, let's play the Wii, that'd be even easier.
1945700	1953700	Because everyone wants to play- the only reason that people aren't playing Jenga is because it isn't set under the sea or in some fantastic fictional world.
1953700	1959700	That's why people aren't playing Jenga. Not because, you know, it's Jenga or anything.
1959700	1966700	Seriously, look at this box art. Here's the Sega Genesis version, which was put out by Tengen and, yes, developed by Atari.
1966700	1973700	Look at this. I forgot about the dominatrix lady fighter they had in it. I mean, this is a horrible fucking game.
1973700	1975700	Why is that guy just in his underwear?
1975700	1980700	Because that's what they wore when they fought, was panties.
1980700	1982700	Dominatrix fighters.
1982700	1983700	It would be manties.
1983700	1989700	Yes, manties. Digitized manties. That's what you have to look forward to in Pit Fighter.
1989700	1994700	Well, good riddance, Atari. Your time is up. Your fifteen minutes are over.
1994700	1999700	All right. Well, Loki jumped the gun a little bit because we were actually supposed to have the mailbag segment before that.
1999700	2000700	Eh, whatever.
2000700	2005700	That's all right. We can be fluid here on the show. We can, you know, change things around on the fly.
2005700	2008700	So, Dark Soccer, are you ready to do some mailbags?
2008700	2013700	Sure. All right. When you send us emails at mailbag.orangelandradio.com,
2013700	2017700	Jamie will read the emails and she'll pick out her favorite emails and read them.
2017700	2019700	And that's what she's going to do right now here on the program.
2019700	2021700	Let's open up the mailbag.
2021700	2040700	First email dun dun dun comes from Robert M., who is a regular writer, I would say, to our station.
2040700	2051700	And, actually, I have a slight problem with my email because what happened is I had a problem with Firefox doing its...
2051700	2053700	I'm going to close the new thing again.
2053700	2056700	And it didn't reload all the windows, so let's go back to this.
2056700	2062700	Just to clarify last week's letter, while playing the game to a podcast would indeed be bizarre.
2062700	2071700	He's talking about Faze. What I meant is that if you play Faze before you sync your iPod with iTunes,
2071700	2074700	it will not credit the songs or podcasts played during that session.
2074700	2079700	So, let's say I listen to OLR Part A, 30 songs play Faze through my break at work.
2079700	2083700	I listen to 20 more songs followed by a viewing of the latest Ask A Ninja episode.
2083700	2089700	Once I sync my iPod to my computer, but the iPod and iTunes will completely forget that 50 songs of podcasts have been played.
2089700	2094700	I'm not sure why this is. I have the 5th generation 30GB model, if that makes any difference.
2094700	2100700	Secondly, in the ideal way, Nintendo doesn't add an option to view the most recently added Miis.
2100700	2105700	Since two of the four options, one of which is the default, show the most popular Miis,
2105700	2112700	assumes that the most popular Miis can only get more popular, and the newer ones get entirely overlooked.
2112700	2117700	If you ever see any Miis who look vaguely like members of the US, whose line is it anyway, let me know.
2117700	2121700	Looking forward to your next show, Robert M.
2121700	2125700	That would be nice, but it'll never happen, because they're lazy.
2125700	2128700	That has been sort of proven.
2128700	2131700	Next one.
2131700	2136700	And actually, we got an email from someone who's asking technical questions on the station,
2136700	2140700	which I will actually be replying to off of the air.
2140700	2146700	But I'm acknowledging that we received one from DJ Mikey Mike, which I think is actually kind of funny.
2146700	2160700	Then we got a review of a game from Xenocore, who actually sent the email about Oreno Riori, which we had Rob look up.
2160700	2162700	So I'm going to go through and read this email.
2162700	2167700	Hey Ola, the Xbox 360 controller is a good addition to my control set for my PC.
2167700	2169700	I use it for my classic games quite often.
2169700	2173700	However, I wonder if anyone else is having the same issue that I am.
2173700	2177700	However, I test the inputs for the controller, but the triggers seem to be on the same axis.
2177700	2182700	If I use the left trigger, the axis goes to 0%, and if I pull the right one, it goes to 100%.
2182700	2185700	Pull both of the axis stays at 50%.
2185700	2190700	Also, the right stick will only show movement in the low left to high right diagonal.
2190700	2193700	I can't use it as a second analog control. What the fuck?
2193700	2196700	I thought Microsoft made PC controls better than this.
2196700	2200700	Hopefully, it's just the crack my roomie snuck into my food.
2200700	2203700	One more thing.
2203700	2213700	Since my question had folks guessing, allow me to tell you why I seek the knowledge that I do with the quick review of Oreno Riori for the PS1 Japan.
2213700	2218700	My cooking, as it is known in the US, is a DualShock-centered cooking simulation.
2218700	2226700	The player is a head chef of a cooking establishment that has you preparing various dishes, depending on the restaurant's theme, ramen, fast food, etc.
2226700	2233700	To use the first stage as an example, you take the customer's order as they walk in, start the soup for the ramen, chop the vegetables for the ramen, the thinner the better.
2233700	2236700	One stick is used for your hand position.
2236700	2239700	The other controls the chef's knife.
2239700	2243700	You take the soup off of the heat before it burns, you put the ramen in the brim of the blob, ok.
2243700	2245700	You cook ramen.
2245700	2248700	The game comes in here. You have six seats that can be full at one time.
2248700	2252700	Managing what you work on and when is the name of the game.
2252700	2257700	In your prep time, your orders will pile up, causing the irate customer to leave before you are done and lower your restaurant's rating.
2257700	2260700	Hey, isn't there a Flash game like that on Yahoo?
2260700	2262700	Except you're just serving people.
2262700	2263700	You mean Diner Dash?
2263700	2265700	Diner Dash, that's it.
2265700	2267700	While you are running the restaurant, other random events occur.
2267700	2271700	These show up as attacks on the other players in versus mode.
2271700	2273700	A customer may leave without paying.
2273700	2281700	You have to chase him down, kill the roaches that flood into the restaurant with your shoe, call the police on wandering drunks that enter the restaurant, and washing dishes.
2281700	2283700	There's a link here on that.
2283700	2284700	The game is a blast to play.
2284700	2290700	If you like Cookie Mama and want to feel like a short order cook from Rolf House, give this game a shot.
2290700	2292700	It makes Cookie Mama look like a welcome part.
2292700	2295700	Dr. Sarkar, this game is especially worthy of a spot in your import collection.
2295700	2296700	Maybe.
2296700	2300700	Hopefully you won't kick Cookie Mama to the curb after playing this one.
2300700	2301700	As always, keep up the good work on the show.
2301700	2303700	Yours truly, Xenocore.
2303700	2309700	Rama is suggesting Iron Chef for the Wii, and Son of Dad in chat room is suggesting Hell's Kitchen for the Wii.
2309700	2313700	That would be great. My Wii could swear at me and tell me what a horrible person I am when I botched this.
2313700	2315700	I thought they were doing a Hell's Kitchen Wii game.
2315700	2317700	Or not a Wii game, but a Hell's Kitchen game.
2317700	2319700	A Playstation 2 game or something, yeah.
2319700	2321700	I want to say I heard something about that too.
2321700	2323700	There you have it.
2323700	2325700	That sounds like an interesting game, though.
2325700	2328700	I would check it out, yeah.
2328700	2330700	Why not?
2330700	2332700	People do play stuff on PS1.
2332700	2334700	Howdy, O.O.R.
2334700	2338700	I've heard this guy mention the fondness for old school Zork and an enthusiasm I share.
2338700	2343700	I thought you guys might be interested in this, and this is www.ifcomp.org.
2343700	2345700	I-F-C-O-M-P.
2345700	2347700	It's one of the few yearly contests.
2347700	2349700	This one just wrapped up for Homebrew Text Adventures.
2349700	2355700	There's quite a community out there of interactive fiction enthusiasts.
2355700	2364700	I've designed a half-assed I.F. game or two, but never finished anything, so I think that these intrepid designers deserve a round of applause.
2364700	2367700	I encourage anyone interested in the medium to check it out.
2367700	2372700	It can be used in some fascinating ways and often surpasses gaming and story and character development.
2372700	2374700	Anywho, keep keeping on. You guys rock.
2374700	2375700	Atreyu.
2375700	2380700	You know, I want to say about a year ago, there was somebody that did an Orange Lounge Radio Text Adventure game.
2380700	2382700	I seem to remember playing it.
2382700	2383700	It was pretty fun.
2383700	2385700	It was very funny. It was very cool.
2385700	2387700	I would like to see a sequel done.
2387700	2394700	This one comes from Ospher, which actually I think I have two emails from Ospher.
2394700	2396700	I'm sorry, you're limited to one email a week.
2396700	2398700	The other one's really short, so I'll just...
2398700	2399700	Fine.
2399700	2402700	Actually, it doesn't matter. The other one's a request, so I'll read the one.
2402700	2403700	Hey, O.R.
2403700	2404700	Hey.
2404700	2406700	I was just curious about your names.
2406700	2408700	Sky, Dark Sakura, and Loki.
2408700	2410700	Yeah, it's this question again.
2410700	2412700	We haven't gotten this question in a while. Why not?
2412700	2415700	What's the story behind them, and when did you start using those names?
2415700	2421700	As for mine, Ospher is simply a cross between Zephyr, one of my favorite Bimani songs, and Austin, which is my real name.
2421700	2422700	Oops.
2422700	2425700	Well, I guess you wanted us to know if you were reading it online.
2425700	2426700	Random comment.
2426700	2428700	Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions is my new anti-drug.
2428700	2429700	Thanks, Ospher.
2429700	2430700	P.S.
2430700	2435700	I know that you'll do what you want, but I still insist for a star for the Sega Genesis.
2435700	2439700	I've tried to describe this game to people, and I get weird looks, but trust me, it's a gem. Play it.
2439700	2440700	I know, I've played it.
2440700	2441700	P.P.S.
2441700	2443700	Yara, sponsored by Kmart.
2443700	2444700	P.P.P.S.
2444700	2447700	I want to hear Loki rant in an English accent.
2447700	2451700	Well, maybe we can get Loki to tell us about his name in an English accent.
2451700	2453700	No, I'm not doing that.
2453700	2456700	Well, won't you give us a jolly old story?
2456700	2458700	I'm not even trying tonight.
2458700	2460700	Alright, tell us about your name.
2460700	2462700	It's named after a Norse god.
2462700	2465700	I started using it when I was playing Qsar.
2465700	2467700	A lot.
2467700	2470700	O.M.G., you didn't get it from Dogma?
2470700	2475700	No, actually, if anything, I got it from The Mask.
2475700	2477700	Alright, there you have it.
2477700	2481700	Well, mine was, I used to be a Japanese major when I lived in Alabama.
2481700	2482700	Go fig.
2482700	2485700	I was actually going into the JET program, which is why I was doing it.
2485700	2491700	But our teacher decided that she would give all of us names in Japanese in class
2491700	2497700	so that when we were doing stuff in class, we would just use those names.
2497700	2499700	My French teacher did the same thing, too.
2499700	2503700	I was actually taking French and Japanese at the same time, which I never recommend doing.
2503700	2509700	But she was trying to think of one for me, and since I was born in the spring in April,
2509700	2513700	she gave me Sakura for the cherry blossoms blooming in April.
2513700	2515700	So that's how I got it.
2515700	2518700	And I just decided at the time when everyone else was making dark names,
2518700	2520700	I put dark in front of it.
2520700	2522700	Because you were emo.
2522700	2525700	This was pre-emo.
2525700	2527700	Yes, but you're always on the cutting edge, Jamie.
2527700	2528700	I am.
2528700	2535700	But the other funny thing about this is that I met somebody on AOL who went by Evil Sakura
2535700	2537700	who was mad at me for getting dark Sakura,
2537700	2544700	but it turned out her boyfriend knew Dan because Dan at the time had
2544700	2551700	RichterDX, as in DraculaX, and her boyfriend had RichterDXX
2551700	2555700	and had gotten into a stat with Dan over their code names,
2555700	2558700	and it turns out that this guy is Chris Tang.
2558700	2560700	Oh, wow.
2560700	2562700	So that's how we met him.
2562700	2564700	It's a world of laughter.
2564700	2565700	Small world, huh?
2565700	2567700	It's a world of tears.
2567700	2569700	It's a world of hope.
2569700	2570700	This is back in the day.
2570700	2572700	I wish I had a funny story to my name.
2572700	2574700	Mine is just like this constant evolution.
2574700	2576700	I don't know.
2576700	2578700	How do people pick screen names?
2578700	2580700	They pick something that sounds interesting.
2580700	2582700	And so my very first screen name was Green Sky,
2582700	2585700	because if the sky were green, that would be different but cool,
2585700	2587700	and that is kind of how I perceive myself.
2587700	2590700	I'm different, but I like to think I'm cool, even if kids tell me otherwise.
2590700	2593700	But that name is taken on a lot of sites.
2593700	2596700	There are five other green skies out there, so it's hard to use that name.
2596700	2599700	So at one point I decided to spell sky differently,
2599700	2601700	so you put an IE instead of Y.
2601700	2603700	So it was Green Sky, and then one day I said,
2603700	2606700	I'm not green anymore, so it was just Sky.
2606700	2609700	And that's the real deal, like how my name came about.
2609700	2611700	It's just one constant evolution after another.
2611700	2614700	So it's not Ski or Grenski or whatever people say.
2614700	2616700	It's just Sky.
2616700	2618700	That's it.
2618700	2619700	And it works.
2619700	2623700	I'm GZDR4EV.
2623700	2626700	I actually had the name before there was a Dark Sakura,
2626700	2628700	before there was a Sakura in Street Fighter.
2628700	2632700	I was in college in 1994.
2632700	2637700	No, I started taking Japanese in early 1995, so this predates.
2637700	2641700	However, I did think it was funny that there was a Dark Sakura later,
2641700	2644700	and I said that I should sue Capcom for name infringement,
2644700	2646700	but it was a joke.
2646700	2647700	You should.
2647700	2650700	I actually adopted the character as my avatar later on,
2650700	2655700	so I even sunburned all the pictures I had and gave her red eyes.
2655700	2656700	All right.
2656700	2658700	Well, there you have it, the story of our names.
2658700	2659700	Was that the last email?
2659700	2660700	Yes, it was.
2660700	2661700	All right.
2661700	2665700	Mailbag at orangelaundry.com if you have further things to contribute.
2665700	2670700	Meanwhile, we go back into the gaming news with this story out of Brazil.
2670700	2672700	That's right, gaming news out of Brazil,
2672700	2675700	and this is actually pretty awesome.
2675700	2677700	This is a company called Tech Toy,
2677700	2681700	and what they're doing is that they're basically licensing from Sega
2681700	2687700	the right to make an official portable Genesis, or if you will, Mega Drive.
2687700	2689700	It's an official portable Mega Drive,
2689700	2692700	and it has a little controller and three buttons on it.
2692700	2695700	I would say it looks like a Game Boy Micro, but bigger,
2695700	2700700	and it has the buttons on it, and it has 20 games already on it.
2700700	2704700	Alex Kidd, Sonic and Knuckles, Golden Axe, Echo the Dolphin,
2704700	2708700	and of course the color of the unit is blue, just like Sega.
2708700	2711700	The 20 games are already pre-installed on the unit.
2711700	2715700	Unfortunately, you can't add to them or take away from them
2715700	2716700	once you have the 20 games.
2716700	2717700	That's all you get.
2717700	2719700	So they say.
2719700	2722700	It runs on three AAA batteries.
2722700	2723700	Kind of interesting.
2723700	2728700	It will cost about the Brazilian equivalent of $100 US.
2728700	2730700	December 5th is the day it comes out,
2730700	2732700	just in time for Brazilian Christmas,
2732700	2734700	which there will be no snow.
2734700	2735700	I'll tell you something about that.
2735700	2736700	There might be.
2736700	2738700	Brazil's a big country, and there's lots of mountain ranges,
2738700	2741700	but I think it's the other time of year over there, so anyway.
2741700	2743700	Well, something about that is that actually,
2743700	2745700	Dan was pointing out to me,
2745700	2747700	and this was a couple years ago that he pointed out to me,
2747700	2752700	is that the Sega Master System actually still has a very big following in Brazil,
2752700	2755700	because a lot of the Master System sites that he found,
2755700	2761700	or even a lot of ROMs that he found when we both used to be heavy into emulation,
2761700	2767700	were games that were Genesis games that we knew on the Genesis,
2767700	2768700	but had been put out for Master System
2768700	2771700	because they had come out over there on Master System.
2771700	2773700	I think all of our Brazilian listeners,
2773700	2774700	of which there ought to be a few,
2774700	2776700	because Brazil's a big fucking place, right?
2776700	2778700	It's just as big as the US almost, right?
2778700	2780700	So I think all our, if not bigger,
2780700	2785700	Brazilian listeners should get together and pool money enough.
2785700	2787700	Like if everybody chips in,
2787700	2789700	let's say there's like 10 people listening to Brazil,
2789700	2791700	I'll chip in $10 and send us one of these,
2791700	2793700	because it sounds kind of fun-ish.
2793700	2795700	I'll fully pay for one.
2795700	2797700	Let me know what the ratio is,
2797700	2799700	and I'll totally pay for one.
2799700	2800700	Nice.
2800700	2801700	I want one.
2801700	2804700	I want one too, but I don't want to have to pay for it,
2804700	2807700	because I'm cheap.
2807700	2808700	All right.
2808700	2809700	We'll see.
2809700	2812700	Anyhow, so that's all I got to say on the portable Mega Drive.
2812700	2815700	It is out in Brazil, or coming out soon.
2815700	2818700	Well, this makes me a very, very sad panda,
2818700	2821700	although I'm not a panda.
2821700	2822700	It makes you a sad Jamie?
2822700	2825700	It makes me a sad me, but not an MII.
2825700	2826700	All right, what is it?
2826700	2828700	Stuff.
2828700	2830700	Marvel Universe Online,
2830700	2832700	there's actually a rumor of cancellation going out.
2832700	2836700	It's been stated that the MMO has run into,
2836700	2840700	quote, serious, potentially stalling developmental troubles.
2840700	2843700	Of course, I find it funny that my reference here,
2843700	2845700	which is on joystick,
2845700	2849700	said that probably because everyone wants to be Wolverine.
2849700	2850700	Not me!
2850700	2853700	So apparently it wasn't Banjo-Kazooie.
2853700	2855700	Oh, is that the big main game
2855700	2857700	that looks like it's getting cancelled, Marvel?
2857700	2859700	Was that supposed to be an Xbox 360 exclusive?
2859700	2861700	I thought it was on PS3 and Xbox.
2861700	2862700	No.
2862700	2863700	Oh, that is a big deal then,
2863700	2865700	because that was like Xbox's MMO,
2865700	2868700	which it was only going to be playable on that system.
2868700	2870700	Yeah, because it wouldn't have totally been just exactly
2870700	2873700	like City of Heroes or anything like that.
2873700	2874700	But it would have been Marvel.
2874700	2876700	It might have been kind of cool.
2876700	2877700	Eh, nope.
2877700	2879700	Eh, we'll see.
2879700	2881700	I want to see a fighting game.
2881700	2883700	I need to do that Mortal Kombat versus DC.
2883700	2884700	That'd be pretty cool.
2884700	2889700	Anyways, so the King Kong game is coming out here pretty soon.
2889700	2892700	Wait, the King of Kong game?
2892700	2893700	DVD, sorry.
2893700	2895700	I think Donkey Kong came out like 20 years ago.
2895700	2898700	Hey, they're going to make a game based on this movie you watch.
2898700	2900700	There's a lot of bad ideas out there
2900700	2902700	and people are waiting to jump on that stuff.
2902700	2905700	Orange Lounge Radio bringing you the late breaking news.
2905700	2908700	Oh, hey kids, did you hear about that totally rad Donkey Kong
2908700	2911700	that's coming out?
2911700	2912700	No, listen, dude.
2912700	2914700	Okay, the King of Kong game, okay?
2914700	2916700	You'll play as the people playing Donkey Kong.
2916700	2919700	This is like even better than Donkey Kong,
2919700	2922700	because you're playing people playing Donkey Kong.
2922700	2927700	Anyways, so yeah, the DVD's coming out soon, in January,
2927700	2929700	being put out by New Line.
2929700	2931700	Actually, we're doing some of our work for this thing.
2931700	2935700	They're having me set up some sort of Donkey Kong competition.
2935700	2937700	Are you going to have the guys there?
2937700	2938700	No.
2938700	2939700	They should come.
2939700	2940700	No, we're low budget, okay?
2940700	2943700	They asked me to download the virtual console game,
2943700	2945700	yet I see no monies for this.
2945700	2947700	They said they'll pay me back later
2947700	2951700	and then they're going to put it on our big theater screen.
2951700	2959700	Anywho, so yeah, it's going to be coming out apparently January 29th.
2959700	2963700	Yeah, but it'll be out on the internet long before.
2963700	2966700	Probably as soon as screeners come out for that.
2966700	2968700	People pirate that shit like crazy.
2968700	2970700	I'm sure there's already a version that's one of those cameras.
2970700	2972700	The question is, why would you want to pirate this?
2972700	2973700	I mean, seriously.
2973700	2975700	I have heard it's a good movie.
2975700	2978700	It's a good movie, but seriously, is it worth wasting a DVD for me?
2978700	2980700	Come on.
2980700	2981700	I want to see it.
2981700	2983700	You should not talk negatively about this.
2983700	2985700	I'm not talking negatively about it.
2985700	2989700	No, it's like, I don't know, it'd be like pirating Gigli.
2989700	2995700	The one crazy dude we met at all games I think is in this movie, Mr. Awesome.
2995700	2997700	Was he there when you and I both went?
2997700	2999700	I know there was one time I went down there and he was there.
2999700	3002700	I think it might have been a different time when I was there by myself.
3002700	3004700	It might have been just you because I don't remember.
3004700	3005700	I think so.
3005700	3007700	I was there one time by myself because I was there on the road trip.
3007700	3009700	I think he was in the movie.
3009700	3013700	Obviously, I'd remember someone named Mr. Awesome.
3013700	3016700	Was he at E3? He was probably at E3 that year.
3016700	3018700	I don't know.
3018700	3021700	Someone named Mr. Awesome needs to be punched in the face.
3021700	3022700	I mean, seriously.
3022700	3024700	I'm Mr. Awesome.
3024700	3028700	This guy was interesting.
3028700	3029700	There's really no other word to describe.
3029700	3032700	He was one of the most interesting fellows I've ever met.
3032700	3034700	I'm sure he was interesting.
3034700	3035700	Retarded.
3035700	3038700	No, I'm not going to talk negatively, Loki.
3038700	3040700	We're not going to have that on this program.
3040700	3042700	He was just interesting.
3042700	3049700	Also interesting is the fact that another movie is being made into a hip new game.
3049700	3051700	Ghostbusters.
3051700	3054700	But I'm not talking about that old-ass Commodore 64 game.
3054700	3055700	Although that game was rad.
3055700	3058700	That was one of the first Commodore 64 games I ever remember owning.
3058700	3061700	I believe this was on the 2600 and all the other systems.
3061700	3063700	But there was a new Ghostbusters game coming out.
3063700	3065700	It's not a remake of the old one.
3065700	3067700	It's a brand new Ghostbusters game.
3067700	3071700	This being previewed by an issue of Game Informer magazine.
3071700	3073700	Apparently some game footage has already hit the internet.
3073700	3075700	Although it's kind of a bit of a rumor.
3075700	3077700	No, it's been confirmed.
3077700	3078700	Is it being confirmed?
3078700	3082700	If you go to Ghostbustersgame.com, there's a bunch of stuff there too.
3082700	3083700	Wow.
3083700	3087700	Anyway, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films.
3087700	3089700	Since they never did make Ghostbusters 3.
3089700	3091700	And now the actors are getting kind of old.
3091700	3094700	Well, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films.
3094700	3096700	Zootfly is developing it.
3096700	3099700	And we don't know exactly what platforms it will be on.
3099700	3102700	But you can probably guess it will be most of the next gen systems.
3102700	3104700	I do kind of hope though it's on Wii.
3104700	3107700	Because I think it will be fun to try and not cross the streams on the Wii.
3107700	3109700	With the whole zapping things.
3109700	3110700	But anyway.
3110700	3112700	I don't know if it might be coming out on the Wii.
3112700	3113700	Here's the other great thing about it.
3113700	3115700	Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis.
3115700	3118700	They are all actually a part of the game.
3118700	3122700	They're apparently writing the script and doing all the voice overs.
3122700	3124700	So that is kind of cool to know that it's authentic.
3124700	3126700	Please don't suck this game.
3126700	3129700	I don't know if Zootfly is actually developing it though.
3129700	3131700	I know that they were doing something similar.
3131700	3132700	I think this is actually Nvidia.
3132700	3133700	It's the same team that worked on it.
3133700	3134700	Oh my bad.
3134700	3135700	Sorry.
3135700	3136700	It was originally rumored as Zootfly.
3136700	3139700	It's the same team that put together these Scarface games.
3139700	3141700	So, you know.
3141700	3143700	That would be cool.
3143700	3145700	I hope it's cool.
3145700	3146700	But guess what Rob?
3146700	3150700	You can pre-order right now through GameStop and you get free shipping.
3150700	3153700	Because those fuckers will take pre-orders on everything.
3153700	3154700	Wow.
3154700	3158700	I think I just got linked some footage here from YouTubers.
3158700	3159700	Oh, that was crap.
3159700	3160700	GameGame.com.
3160700	3161700	Who?
3161700	3162700	God damn it.
3162700	3164700	Who linked me to something from G4?
3164700	3165700	God damn it.
3165700	3166700	Who did that?
3166700	3167700	That was SSG100.
3167700	3168700	Oh, actually no.
3168700	3169700	That does have the gameplay footage.
3169700	3170700	I don't care.
3170700	3171700	It's from G4.
3171700	3173700	There's a Dutch site that had it also on there.
3173700	3174700	That's pretty good.
3174700	3176700	I'm going to try and find.
3176700	3177700	Here's the game.
3177700	3178700	Okay.
3178700	3179700	This looks like the game itself.
3179700	3180700	Yeah.
3180700	3181700	Oh good.
3181700	3182700	Isn't that like an actual first person?
3182700	3186700	Yeah, I mean maybe we're going to get Ghostbusters Go to Hell which you've been talking about
3186700	3190700	for like 15 years and I cannot wait for this game.
3190700	3192700	I can't listen to this.
3192700	3193700	But it looks cool.
3193700	3194700	It looks like Resident Evil but like Ghostbusters.
3194700	3198700	Well, what I like about it is that it's an over the shoulder view and not a first person.
3198700	3200700	I think that's pretty cool.
3200700	3201700	Okay.
3201700	3204700	I've been sent a corrected link from SSG100 Matt without the G4age.
3204700	3205700	Thank you.
3205700	3208700	All is forgiven SSG100 Matt.
3208700	3209700	No?
3209700	3210700	This is still.
3210700	3212700	Shame on you.
3212700	3214700	I'm picking them again.
3214700	3218700	Are you sure you didn't have the old address copied still?
3218700	3220700	Maybe I did.
3220700	3222700	Hold on.
3222700	3228700	I just think that's highly inappropriate to do to give me such sub par.
3228700	3230700	Hold on.
3230700	3231700	Just let it go.
3231700	3232700	Wait.
3232700	3233700	Hold on.
3233700	3234700	Let me try this one.
3234700	3235700	They may have their little bumper on there but that's it.
3235700	3236700	No, it's the same shit.
3236700	3237700	Forget it.
3237700	3238700	I don't care.
3238700	3242700	I've noticed something that if you try to click on the video in window to the next sometimes
3242700	3244700	it will leave the old thing copied.
3244700	3245700	Brilliant.
3245700	3247700	That happened to me with the paddle cap.
3247700	3248700	Okay.
3248700	3249700	Here we go.
3249700	3251700	Somebody grayed out the G4 part in the beginning.
3251700	3252700	That's great.
3252700	3254700	I approve of this link.
3254700	3261700	That does look kind of fun.
3261700	3263700	I hope that is the Wii.
3263700	3264700	That's a 360.
3264700	3265700	Yeah.
3265700	3266700	The graphics look very 360.
3266700	3267700	They do.
3267700	3268700	Wait.
3268700	3271700	Keep going because there's a part where they show the Stay Puft Marshmallow.
3271700	3272700	Yes.
3272700	3273700	Wow.
3273700	3275700	They shot him in the face.
3275700	3283700	That game looks like it's going to be kind of fun.
3283700	3284700	Wow.
3284700	3285700	Very cool.
3285700	3287700	I would play it.
3287700	3290700	But guess what else I would play.
3290700	3292700	What else would you play?
3292700	3294700	Um.
3294700	3296700	Luminous.
3296700	3297700	Luminous is a good game.
3297700	3298700	I would play that too.
3298700	3300700	Luminous is coming to Windows.
3300700	3301700	Wow.
3301700	3303700	Is it going to have shine in?
3303700	3305700	It better.
3305700	3306700	It better have Heavenly Start.
3306700	3309700	It better have everything else that's awesome about it.
3309700	3310700	But yeah.
3310700	3312700	It's going to be on Windows.
3312700	3313700	So isn't that cool?
3313700	3314700	That is kind of cool.
3314700	3317700	Although then again if you think about it Luminous has been hoarded on like every other
3317700	3321700	thing out there including my cell phone so this does kind of make sense.
3321700	3323700	I need Luminous for my iPhone.
3323700	3326700	Give me Luminous on my iPhone I'll be happy.
3326700	3327700	Keep on dreaming.
3327700	3330700	Now you know what would be cool is like a version of Luminous on your iPhone that uses
3330700	3332700	the songs from your iPhone.
3332700	3333700	That would be cool.
3333700	3334700	That would be cool.
3334700	3335700	There you go.
3335700	3343700	Something not so cool is apparently R-Type Command which is better known as R-Type Tactics
3343700	3344700	in Japan.
3344700	3351700	It is coming out over here according to GameStop's website on March 4th.
3351700	3353700	Although that's probably a placeholder date.
3353700	3359700	But for $39.99 it is a tactical version of R-Type.
3359700	3361700	That means it's not going to be cool.
3361700	3370700	It's being put out by Atlas and I believe it says the game requires or it says excuse
3370700	3374700	the lightning fast reflexes need to avoid enemy fire.
3374700	3382700	Instead offering a turn based hex based strategic game play.
3382700	3386700	You will not just control one ship with a fleet of ships.
3386700	3387700	I don't know.
3387700	3389700	It sounds stupid to me.
3389700	3391700	If it's tactics it sucks.
3391700	3395700	It's like what would it be like Ikaruga tactics or something like that.
3395700	3399700	Hey dodging all those bullets is really hard so let's just make it turn based.
3399700	3400700	Yeah.
3400700	3401700	Awesome.
3401700	3406700	If by awesome you mean not at all then yeah.
3406700	3412700	Let's just call it R-Type Extremely Awesome.
3412700	3415700	Alright yeah not a game I'm very interested in checking out.
3415700	3417700	R-Type is cool and all but it's not that cool.
3417700	3418700	Let's face it.
3418700	3422700	Skype line open for business www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3422700	3424700	Click on interact with us for all the details.
3424700	3430700	Our Skype name is Orange Lounge Radio and our telephone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3430700	3432700	You know how long we've been doing Skype a long time.
3432700	3436700	I think we are actually like one of the first shows ever that use Skype.
3436700	3438700	Maybe the first.
3438700	3440700	I don't know if we can stake that claim but it might be worth a shot.
3440700	3442700	Let's go to the phones.
3442700	3443700	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3443700	3444700	Who's this?
3444700	3445700	This is Jason.
3445700	3446700	Hello.
3446700	3448700	The awesome the awesome the Jason or something like that.
3448700	3451700	The X awesome Jason X awesome V. What's up?
3451700	3454700	I was kind of curious.
3454700	3457700	Has anybody ever played Marble Mania on the Wii?
3457700	3460700	Marble Mania on the Wii. Marble?
3460700	3463700	Kororimpa Marble Mania or Marvel?
3463700	3465700	Yes Kororimpa.
3465700	3472700	I have played Kororimpa and my old roommate known as Xtaphor on this program was obsessed with that game for a little while.
3472700	3473700	For like a week.
3473700	3475700	And I played it too.
3475700	3478700	It was a very very cute and very interesting game.
3478700	3483700	My old roommate from Arizona came up here what two weekends ago I believe.
3483700	3488700	And this is one of the games that he owned and I had never even heard of it before.
3488700	3494700	And it's to me you know I don't know how how much exposure it got.
3494700	3498700	It seems like a very unknown game that was actually very very very fun.
3498700	3503700	I think what happened is that like it kind of felt like an Xbox Live arcade game in a way.
3503700	3507700	Like it just had so much in common with like Marble Blast and some of those games.
3507700	3509700	But the tilt control.
3509700	3512700	But yeah but it had the tilt control which is kind of fun.
3512700	3513700	No I played it it was fun.
3513700	3518700	And I seem to remember that one night Rice Princess and Xtaphor were up like laughing all night long.
3518700	3522700	Because there was like the penguin that would fart while it rolled around.
3522700	3524700	And it made this little pfft pfft pfft noise.
3524700	3528700	And it was like really really funny in a five year old kind of way.
3528700	3530700	I had the penguin but I never actually played with it.
3530700	3533700	So I used the more mission targeted ones.
3533700	3535700	Check it out it's hilarious.
3535700	3536700	And yes it was a Konami game.
3536700	3540700	And they also did you know obviously DDR and Dewey's Adventure and all this other stuff.
3540700	3541700	Really?
3541700	3542700	You don't see.
3542700	3546700	Well it came out around the same time as Wing Island as well.
3546700	3550700	And they were both kind of very under the radar and kind of average.
3550700	3553700	I thought it was kind of neat though because you could play two players on one controller.
3553700	3557700	If you had one person use the nunchuck and the other person use the remote.
3557700	3559700	Huh.
3559700	3560700	So.
3560700	3561700	I don't know.
3561700	3566700	Well then three cheers for Kururimpa from our studly Jason.
3566700	3568700	What else have you been playing lately?
3568700	3573700	I have been playing Super Paper Mario which is immensely better than Paper Mario.
3573700	3577700	I never played Thousand Year Door but Super Paper Mario is actually pretty addicting.
3577700	3580700	You sound pretty in love with your Wii right now.
3580700	3586700	If it's not 360 which in last I'd say in this week it hasn't been so much I go
3586700	3588700	between the two.
3588700	3593700	I was marching through Resident Evil 4 which I still haven't beaten.
3593700	3595700	Oh Resident Evil.
3595700	3596700	Okay.
3596700	3600700	Much like I revealed the I don't play Zelda very often and everybody called me a blastomer.
3600700	3601700	I know.
3601700	3602700	I'm sorry.
3602700	3608700	I've played Resident Evil 2 a couple times but all of these kind of stopped not too terribly
3608700	3609700	far into it.
3609700	3614700	Code Veronica was the one game that I got I think about halfway through with but I just
3614700	3616700	kind of stopped playing it.
3616700	3619700	Resident Evil 4 with the Wii controls.
3619700	3621700	Big exception.
3621700	3625700	That made that game so unbelievably fun.
3625700	3629700	I haven't played Resident Evil 4 on the Wii yet but honestly I thought it was great on
3629700	3632700	the GameCube so like the Wii would just add even more to it.
3632700	3634700	Wide screen and motion controls sounds hot.
3634700	3636700	Wide screen, the free aim pointing.
3636700	3641700	That's the best part of it is that you have the full screen to aim with the remote.
3641700	3643700	It makes it the best.
3643700	3645700	It's great.
3645700	3647700	It's so fun to control.
3647700	3648700	It's so fun to play.
3648700	3649700	Sounds hot.
3649700	3651700	All right Jason we've got to let you go to get some more calls but any other thoughts
3651700	3652700	from our listeners?
3652700	3657700	I own Metroid Prime Corruption and I haven't even opened it and played it yet.
3657700	3659700	Oh my god that game is great.
3659700	3660700	You need to do that now.
3660700	3664700	I know but I have so many things I want to play.
3664700	3665700	Tonight Jason.
3665700	3669700	Tonight you are to open that game tonight and play.
3669700	3670700	You must.
3670700	3671700	Don't tell me no.
3671700	3675700	You know you can't tell me no I'm cute.
3675700	3676700	This is true.
3676700	3677700	All right.
3677700	3680700	All right Jason and say hi to Ry for us.
3680700	3681700	Will do.
3681700	3682700	Bye.
3682700	3683700	Bye.

3696180	3697180	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3697180	3698180	Who's this?
3698180	3699180	Yo what's up?
3699180	3700180	It's Rannie.
3700180	3701180	Rannie what's up?
3701180	3702180	Not much.
3702180	3703180	Hi.
3703180	3704180	Remember.
3704180	3705180	Hey Jamie.
3705180	3706180	Hi Loki.
3706180	3707180	He's ignoring you.
3707180	3708180	Wow.
3708180	3709180	Hello.
3709180	3711180	He's ignoring you Wow
3712960	3718540	Microphone down. Oh, sorry. Okay. What's that problem? Remember a few weeks ago you talked about the movie press start
3719860	3726160	Yes, wasn't that that one that looked like this like horrible like not even a b-movie but like a c-movie production
3726160	3730920	But not that that's necessarily a bad thing like done by like total hardcore nerds
3732580	3734580	It was fucking awesome
3734580	3741260	See it was a great my room my roommate ordered it and we watched it last night. Oh my god. It was great
3741540	3746320	What was tell now without ruining it too much tell us something that was like really funny about it
3747260	3752700	It's just the homages and the parodies and the respects to gay to old-school gaming
3752740	3755540	The plot was like very Final Fantasy ish
3756360	3760180	The opening was paper boy and well it went on from there
3760180	3766980	Did it seem like this was a video game movie that got it like it was actually made by gamers and like for people in?
3766980	3767980	the know
3767980	3773700	Yes, and I believe you can make a drinking game out of this were there any well-known actors in it
3774340	3779980	No brand new people just a total like C movie. How about nudity? Was there any nudity in the film?
3780580	3786660	No, but there was I'm a nearly naked chick. Okay. Well, that's that's right. That's close to nudity. That's partial nudity
3786660	3790660	All right, good good times. So cool
3790660	3795320	Then we'll have to put that on our Christmas list to check out that movie anything that you've been playing this week
3795940	3801220	Let's see. I've been playing phantom hourglass on and thanks to Jane. I've been playing our own
3802020	3806440	He he he he he he no dear watch out. The cancer is spreading
3808940	3813220	Not bad plus I fired up on Age of Mythology been playing that again
3813220	3820460	Very cool. Sounds cool, and I've been playing that new sim pack that's been coming out for step mania
3820460	3823900	What was it orange lounge revolution? Oh, well revolution. Did you check it out?
3824540	3826540	Yeah, what'd you think?
3826900	3831460	Rob what how come you're not on American Idol? Oh, shut up
3832620	3838080	My worst fear about that stinking thing is that those karaoke things are gonna get out there was something I did
3838080	3842180	It was a stupid thing like three people were listening like nobody listened back in the day
3842180	3846260	But go figure one of those three people was recording and now it's out there forever
3847780	3855460	Horrible horrible, but I do I mean even though that's end of it I can do without I think it's extremely flattering that people actually
3855460	3857260	Took the time to create
3857260	3862540	Something related to orange lounge radio and and some of our in jokes say it's incredibly flattering
3862540	3867900	So thank you to everybody who was involved because I knew like probably like six different people contributed step files backgrounds
3867900	3870940	I mean, it was a group project. So well done to all
3870940	3875100	Definitely and after playing and I suggest the DT. We need to do something new
3876100	3878460	All right. Well, then you'll have to get a hard at work on
3880020	3886380	Ol revolution second mix plus I'm no not dancing not dancing. Oh, oh a new game
3887020	3893220	I suggested orange lounge the revolution the fighting game. Well, wait, what about a new game, right?
3893460	3897540	There was yes, there was a well our versus age AGI wasn't there at some point
3897540	3903060	I was like, well before we get to that we gotta have the first game which would have to be orange lounge the fighter
3903060	3909900	I say AGI to fighter then the versus match. I see I see so we will build to the versus game. That's good
3909940	3915140	All right. Well, you guys get to work on that any last thought any last thoughts for the callers Rambo before we let you go
3915140	3919060	I think we'd start this after the holidays, you know when everybody's like oh
3919620	3925420	Let's make a fighter. That's fine when everybody's that's what that's when I'm gonna finally get around to redoing the website into something viewable
3925420	3930900	We'll be around holidays. All right. Take care Rama. Love you guys. Later. Mwah. Bye
3931900	3934160	If you'd like to give us a call one eight seven seven game
3934160	3939900	Ol our username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word smooshed together. No spaces. No dashes. Nothing
3941020	3943020	All right
3943100	3945660	The Rob D says good luck with the AG side
3945660	3949740	I'm one of the few fighting fans and I guess AGI has been on a bit of like a kind of like a little bit
3949740	3953900	Of a hiatus in the past few weeks and I think that's because Scott's been on a little bit of a hiatus
3953900	3959820	and I think that's because Scott's been going on the road doing like a reality show type thing with these guys who are
3960620	3965180	Like a counter-strike team. I think it was I watched I watched the pilot that he had posted
3965180	3970300	It wasn't bad. Is it because his writers went on strike? No, this was planned before the writers went on strike
3970300	3973740	No, I meant his writers went on strike, you know for all his jokes. I don't think his writer
3973740	3976660	I don't know. He has writers if they are they're definitely not Union
3977420	3979340	But yeah, I watched the pilot. It's not bad
3979340	3982820	He posted all over if you have all games friended or whatever was it was a good watch
3982820	3988180	But the only thing that pissed me off is apparently he was in El Dorado Hills, which is two towns over
3988540	3993340	Did we get a call? No, I've ever seen that stupid bus thing right there. That was Scott was there
3993340	3995980	Oh that bastard that bastard didn't give us a call
3996460	3999940	He has a second punch in the face after mr. Awesome. That's right. I
4004900	4010300	Saw that bus I'm like, oh my god, there's a counter-strike buzz at that fucking next-level place now
4010300	4015180	we have these now we have a reason to have the olr fighting game because some of these to punch Scott in the face for
4015180	4021540	Not calling us when I obviously was in Loki's backyard. I was there. I went to see a movie like god
4021540	4023020	There's a counter-strike bus here
4023020	4027060	I'm like, why would they well because it went to this land center next level or something
4027060	4030660	I we've haven't we all been there. I haven't no I had I have a customer that hates
4031180	4036540	Their competing land centers or whatever and they they absolutely hate them and they talk crap about them all day long
4036540	4041220	But um, you know, so I saw them like why is there anyone here? I mean, seriously, it's El Dorado Hills
4041220	4044780	I mean like does anyone actually play land games here means?
4046220	4051900	All right. Well, we're gonna go back to the phones and we'll take another call and then we're going to
4052620	4057620	Get into some last-minute stories be someone awesome. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
4059820	4062600	Hi legend Zaku, what's on your mind said awesome
4062600	4067080	Um, um, but I've been much just chilling on this weekend coming
4067640	4072120	Basically just coming back from tournaments and whatnot. What tournament was it this time?
4072840	4080260	Those went on Jersey you heard of this arcade called fun and games, which is closing down five months to relocate nearby
4080760	4084000	So they were just having a holding shit load of tournaments yesterday
4084000	4089360	No, the only arcade I've been to in Jersey is that eight on the break, which is pretty well known I guess so yeah
4089360	4096580	But besides that I'm just you know, just gloating over the fact that just you know a game like
4097100	4099480	Like Mario Galaxy, you know
4101040	4106960	Now last week you were so freakin excited like you had so much energy last week when you called in the thing
4106960	4113760	Is that it's like more it's basically plays like Mario 64 the whole thing plays like it and that's a bad thing
4113760	4120560	Good job. It plays its motion. You know, it's basically Mario 64 motion controls and if your graphics and
4121120	4125300	You know, I mean when you place when you play Mario 64, I mean
4126280	4131360	You get that feeling of just you know that new innovate anyway innovative, you know
4132240	4135060	Just you'll die instantly and you have life
4135680	4138880	Or is this one? I don't know. I guess it kind of
4138880	4144060	Kind of here's what it boils down to. Here's what boils down to a Zaku is that did you have fun?
4144080	4146400	Because if you have yeah, I was happy
4148000	4153360	Yeah, I know I just got to give a little bit more time since I played I only played in Nintendo
4153360	4158160	We're you know launched last week then again. I have I haven't picked up the full game myself yet
4158160	4162400	I tried to go to Toys R Us this week to pick up the game because they're doing that whole $25 gift card thing and
4162400	4165800	Once you know what they didn't get the game the day it came out. There's some shipping delay
4165800	4170320	I don't know probably some frickin truck full of Super Mario galaxies tipped over on the freeway or some shit
4170400	4171320	So I didn't buy it
4171320	4175440	But I did we did that preview last week and I got I was lucky enough to get to play it for the 40 minutes
4175440	4180360	It was fun to see I would get a week, you know, I would just I would seriously get a week
4180360	4182360	There was you know more
4182720	4185200	More in terms of a little bit more hardcore games
4185200	4189600	I know they're trying to stick to the you know, I'm trying to stay on you know, the course of all casual thing
4189600	4195920	I mean, I already know Metroid and you know whatnot but stuff like I don't know
4195920	4198200	I'm just gonna make good use of the motion controls
4198960	4202960	You know and especially the online stuff that's pretty much lacking
4203160	4207240	They want to compete with you know against Microsoft and Sony but brawls gonna be sexy
4207400	4211420	That's I know right here probably gonna be so I think that's gonna be like the new you know
4211420	4217580	The new game for anime conventions. Oh Lordy's. Yes, you're gonna see a whole bunch of like those otaku folks
4217580	4222440	She's duking it out with the motion controls and whatnot. It's gonna be the new tournament game
4223180	4227820	February. All right, Zaku any other thoughts for our listeners before we take some more calls. Um
4228460	4233860	Just gotta love the hypocrisy of people banning Mass Effect one day and unbending the other
4234380	4236380	Talking to you see this one. All right
4236900	4238900	Rock on Zaku
4238940	4240940	right
4240940	4242940	I
4244900	4248460	Sounded so let down at the end there rock on right
4249100	4255940	All right. Oh Mass Effect sounds like it'll be fun. No one looking forward to Mass Effect. I can rock on with Mass Effect
4256620	4259420	Mass Effect was oh, it's too much talking though, right?
4259420	4265120	It's seriously 25 minutes to get those like listening to the Skype segment of this program. It's not necessarily like that
4265120	4268800	It's just you know, blah blah blah blah blah. We got set the story blah blah blah blah
4268800	4274840	it's funny though because like you you pick your backstory and stuff and it's just it's really but there's lesbian sex and
4275920	4278000	In the way you get the name your character
4278000	4280440	But they all call you by your last name because you can't change that
4280440	4284000	All right, we're getting another call sir. We got to get to it. All right. Hi, you're on orange loss radio
4284000	4289120	Who's this? This is Brad from pod culture. Hello Brad from pod culture a long time. Go talk. What's on your mind?
4289400	4292280	That's the first time I've been able to listen to the live feed in about a month
4293120	4296960	Well who said you were excused to leave for one? No, I'm kidding. I know things get in the way
4296960	4299120	Well, I heard a Zaku
4299780	4301780	Talking about Super Mario Galaxy
4302400	4306280	Yes, pick that up yesterday and let me think it's the most fun
4306280	4309760	I've had in the game in a long time and that's what a lot of the reviews are saying
4309760	4317000	Did you hear this week Mario Galaxy is now like the official like number one rated game ever on that
4317000	4322600	I don't know if it's metacritic or one of those other like game rankings. That's what this game rankings calm is surpassed
4322600	4328760	Ocarina of time is the number one game now granted one negative review will fuck that all up at this point
4328800	4331240	But right now it is like the number one game of all time
4331240	4336360	Which actually kind of surprised me because I thought generally Bioshock was getting better reviews this year, but go fig
4337240	4342600	People let me not play Bioshock yet. I can't judge on that but it's the first Wii game
4342600	4344880	I've seen where the controls haven't felt tacked on
4345920	4346960	Aha
4346960	4351440	Because because this this was the game and I think a lot of people have kind of described it this way
4351440	4353440	This was the game that the Wii was kind of made for
4354080	4356040	Like this was Miyamoto's big idea
4356040	4360520	Like here's how I want to do the next Mario game and they're like, okay Miyamoto. You're so fucking awesome
4360520	4362520	We'll build a console around it
4363440	4369720	It is it's really cool because it's it just feels natural and playing it and it's still it was a
4371240	4375900	Had an old-school feel but it still had the new controls and pretty graphics
4375900	4381960	But it was a lot of fun and it had that little bits of retro ness that you've come to love from Nintendo
4381960	4387660	Like tell me when you were watching that opening scene and the airships came in and the old-school airship music from Mario 3 play
4387660	4389540	Tell me that wasn't awesome. Oh
4389540	4395180	Even when he goes down the tube and it makes the little sound. Yeah, it's great little touch of retro ness
4395180	4399880	That makes it makes it awesome. So for him when you're in one of the hidden levels in it
4400360	4405360	You follow have to pick up the notes and plays a little Super Mario Brothers scene. Oh, that's right
4405360	4408800	I remember that that was cool. We saw that and one of the levels we played good times
4409640	4415080	Anything anything else you've been playing lately besides Mario Galaxy? Nah, too busy getting stuff ready for
4415680	4422100	My girlfriend's trip to the hospital. Oh, no. Sorry to hear that. I hope everything's okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah
4423440	4425440	We'll have her in our plumbing removed
4425960	4431680	Okay, well we'll have her in our thoughts and hope everything is well and and you'll have to bring her a DS or some games
4431680	4438000	To cheer her up or maybe doctor who he's mean for what's that picked up harvest moon for her Gameboy Advance
4438000	4438620	There you go
4438620	4444580	That will keep a person occupied for a long-ass time to like finally like get anything accomplished in that game. It'll be great
4446240	4450800	All right, I just got that saying it call in and say yeah that it's Super Mario is probably the
4451560	4455200	Most fun and a long time on that of the game you think it's gonna be game of the year. I
4455200	4463460	Think it's got a broader appeal than some of the other games that have been rating real high like bow shock won't appeal to
4463660	4469940	Everybody or Halo 3 won't appeal to everybody but Mario Galaxy has more of a wider appeal
4469940	4472020	I think that's a dang good point
4472020	4472540	You're right
4472540	4475420	A lot of the games that are kind of leading the race for game of the year right now
4475740	4483380	May not have that same family friendly quote-unquote appeal that Mario Galaxy has and that is so important during the Christmas time rush
4483380	4484980	very good point
4484980	4487460	Well Brad, thank you so much for calling in as always
4487460	4492580	We'd love to hear from you and and hope everything is okay for you this holiday season already. All right
4492580	4495200	Yes. All right. Take care, buddy. Later on. Bye. Bye
4496100	4500820	Very good point there Super Mario Galaxy may not be the game of the year for the hardcore gamer
4500820	4502020	But certainly a broad game
4502020	4506580	Of course, we will be doing a grand Christmas show this year just like we did last year
4506580	4510740	I should say end of the year show more details on that throughout the month of December
4511220	4513680	We have more calls higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?
4513680	4518320	Hey, what's up guys? It's Robbie. It's been a while. Wow. Hi a while. How are you Rob?
4519120	4523520	Not too bad. I've mostly been working on Sunday's closing. So, uh, I work at a bookstore
4523520	4526840	So, you know retail gets no time off. Gotcha. Yeah, especially
4527800	4530200	Live in a while. So it's nice to hear you guys. Yes
4530200	4534880	It's nice to have you on the program and congratulations. You guys have got an icon as well on the marketplace this week
4534880	4539120	I understand that is true. Now. We actually need to put out a show and your yes
4539120	4541680	And your icon is very nice looking too. I was very impressed
4541680	4546880	The funny story about that. Actually, we had a we thought about just toning down our original
4547680	4551120	iTunes artwork, but we figured that wouldn't be good enough for Xbox Live, right?
4551120	4554800	I I went to one of the all games chatters DC Nate
4555680	4557680	awesome guy and
4557800	4561040	we talked a little bit about camp with an idea for the clock and everything and
4561280	4565940	Prepared all that in I think four hours because that was how much time he had left before out of the the deadline
4565940	4567760	Yeah, we had to get that stuff in fast
4567760	4573000	I remember that because like it was black Bobby was a if I was very firm about the deadlines and uh,
4573400	4577840	But I understand I mean he was he gave us worrying to give some time, but it was a very it was a very crude process
4577840	4578160	Yes
4578160	4580400	I'm actually gonna show the chat some of the
4580680	4585360	Rejects for the icon because we actually had a couple icons that were almost there, but they were rejected
4585360	4589480	I'm gonna actually pay some of those in chat. Here's the I'm gonna do the one I did the one
4589480	4592280	I did has the three faces and I don't know how
4592960	4596840	Folks might like that one or whatever, but there's that one. Yeah. Congrats to you guys as well
4596840	4602200	Uh, you're kind of more popular than ours, which isn't too shocking considering. I think only six users are using mine
4602200	4604200	How would you know? How do you know?
4604480	4609620	My gamer card dotnet you can there's something called the gamer pic scout. I think interesting. I'll have to take a look at that
4609760	4613760	Here's another one. That's the one that afro guy originally did but unfortunately just didn't look like resize
4613760	4617840	But you can see where the arrow scheme kind of came in. So there you go. Anyhow, sorry
4617840	4621180	Oh, what'd you call in to talk to us about before we derailed you? You've got that also. Sorry
4621180	4626580	I'm sorry. What did you call in to talk about before we derailed the call?
4627020	4628620	Well, my uh, my first question
4628620	4632420	Well, actually my only question you guys is uh now that most of the games have come out for this holiday season
4632700	4635580	with the exception of Mass Effect, which I actually
4636220	4640980	That's still that's still uh due to be released in before the holidays before Christmas, right?
4640980	4646260	That hasn't been delayed there isn't anything new that I know it comes out in a couple days. Yep, almost here. Okay, cool
4646260	4652300	Um, where would you rank this holiday season compared to other big ones in video game history as far as quality of games go?
4652700	4654660	I'd say it's it's pretty far out there
4654660	4661400	But I think 1998 with Ocarina of Time Metal Gear Solid was a probably better in 2001 with Halo
4661860	4667220	Melee and what was the other big on GTA 3 was probably better. I did complain about this year's games that uh,
4668380	4670180	to me there's a lack of
4670180	4675860	Games that that that can be truly considered timeless like a Metal Gear Solid where people will be coming back to it years later
4675860	4678760	I'm playing it. Maybe galaxy falls into that mold, but
4679300	4683020	Bioshock is a first-person shooter. That's first-person shooters get tossed to the wayside like
4683860	4687620	Yesterday's dinner, especially with no no multiplayer to keep people coming back
4689940	4693440	You know, I gotta say here's the thing about this year's batch of games
4693440	4698220	I think does make it better than than years past and that is the fact that there's no new consoles this year
4698220	4704040	There's nothing in the realm of new consoles. There's console redesigns kind of but there's no new consoles
4704040	4706700	It's really the first year we have we don't even have a new handheld system
4706700	4709980	It's it's it's wide open as to what's out there
4709980	4714700	And I think therefore the consoles that are out of the marketplace have had a little more time to mature
4715540	4720020	Unfortunately, I don't feel PlayStation 3 has used the time to its best of ability
4720020	4723380	Which kind of makes me think honestly PlayStation 3 should have just come out this year
4724980	4729320	But who am I I can see why maybe they didn't do it because you know, they want to be out there whatever
4729320	4734600	But all that aside like you kind of see that now, okay there it's not so much the launch games
4734600	4739000	We're getting into like the second generation of games and you could say even with 360
4739000	4741880	Perhaps even starting to get into the third generation of games for the system
4741880	4743880	I think next year is gonna be even better
4744040	4749960	Honestly, and then probably the year after that is when you're gonna start seeing stuff about the Xbox 720 or their next project
4749960	4751360	So you'll kind of start to die down
4751360	4756080	but I do think kind of like next year will be even better than this year for that reason that there's the
4756080	4760880	The consoles will have had a little time to age and I think that's the thing about I think you cited 98
4760880	4764400	I think that was the time when like, you know, 64 had already been out
4765440	4769360	PlayStation already been out a couple years. I think those, you know systems kind of had their time to
4770360	4772480	Really get you know, some of their best stuff
4773300	4776440	Like a fine wine Jason says in chat. There you go
4777600	4780480	Yeah, that's I was thinking uh, I mean the P
4780480	4786240	it'll be interesting to see how the ps3 brings it next year because Metal Gear Solid 4 hopefully will be out by next holidays and
4787320	4791960	You know 360 really brought it to the table this year. Mm-hmm PlayStation 3 brought a few things with a
4792920	4794920	heavenly sword and a
4795000	4798640	Well a couple of the other ports that came over from the 360 and hopefully next year
4798640	4800360	They can just like really keep it moving
4800360	4805140	Like hopefully the developers don't jump ship because you know home looks really exciting
4805140	4808480	I think Final Fantasy 13 is gonna have people drooling, you know
4808480	4813840	I think there's a lot to look forward to from PlayStation 3, but again, it's been a very slow start
4813840	4815440	But who knows that's a real question
4815440	4818660	Can I can developers get used to the ps3 and use it to its full potential which?
4818880	4821640	Most people seem to agree that it does have a lot of potential
4821640	4826400	It's just really hard to develop for with how like the 8 trillion cores it has on there. Hmm
4827040	4835200	Interesting. I'm getting a message from DMN that says 21 Xbox Live users have the olr pick according to whatever he found so
4835200	4841220	That's amazing. I I would be thrilled if two people were using it. Honestly myself and Loki
4841480	4847080	So yeah, Bobby is winning by a long shot. He had like 220 as of yesterday
4847080	4850420	I think what Bobby has 220 people using his pick
4851040	4853040	Yeah, something like that. Let me check
4853640	4857720	And I'll post a link in chat to all the their community. Yeah, thanks
4857960	4861280	Wow, Bobby actually get to a page that shows all the ranks of
4861280	4865720	The ranks of all the community like all the pictures in that pack Wow
4866520	4870820	That's pretty good. See here. Bobby has 381 evil avatar is
4871560	4875140	487 now Seattle evil avatar has a huge community behind them. So I believe that
4875880	4877880	Yeah, you guys have 22
4878160	4883060	Rock Bobby has what like 15 times the number of people using his picture than we do
4884320	4888840	AGI is 47. I actually know they have 43. I have eight. Whoo. Whoo
4888840	4893180	Nice, don't be in the matrix. Well, we need it. We'll get the shows
4893700	4897800	Damn it. We need people. Okay people using Bobby pictures. He doesn't need it
4897800	4900320	He's switched over to the olr pick or a t-dig pick
4900880	4902880	Bobby didn't Bobby don't need the numbers no more
4903640	4909500	I'm just kidding. I think it's great a lot of support kudos to him. I think it's great to see him at all in this
4910400	4912400	Absolutely. All right. Well Rob D. Oh
4913040	4917160	We've given you way more time the other callers. I gotta let you go. But any quick final thoughts for our listeners
4917160	4920200	Um game on we'll try to get t-dig back
4920200	4925560	But unfortunately can't make promises since like I'm doing I'm going to work practically full-time in school halftime
4925560	4931720	But oh, that's you guys know the excuses you guys have been through that before. I'm sure absolutely later. Absolutely. All right. Take care Rob
4932460	4936960	Good luck to you t-dig was a good show and he hadn't a whole nother guy that edited it too. So
4938100	4941460	Lots of work that went into that show. All right, maybe one more call
4941460	4945100	We got time for one more call then we'll jump into the afterbirth in our rock band post show
4945100	4950940	Actually, I don't see the line ringing. But let's do some quick last-minute stories. Jamie. You have anything for last minute stories
4950940	4952940	I'm not a Mountain Dew
4953540	4960140	Almost doo doo doo doo doo doo. I see a little more Mountain Dew. I have a left. Well, all right Loki I was gonna say
4961260	4964860	Avatar the last airbender the burning earth you can get all
4965220	4968820	1,000 achievement points in two minutes in that game by just
4969060	4972940	Backing up into a corner and hitting a button over and over and over again amazing
4972940	4975020	We got another call higher on orange house radio. Who's this?
4976180	4979340	This is DMN. Hello DMN. What's on your mind? I
4980860	4988100	Have a challenge for the three of you. Oh shit. No, no, this isn't anything stupid. I promise
4988100	4992300	Yeah, I don't know about that. I challenge the three of you
4993080	4998260	To convince myself and everyone listening that dance dance revolution is not dead go
4998260	5002260	Is what dance dance revolution is not dead. I
5003940	5006580	Saw people playing it the other day to the pizza place
5007940	5013420	Here it is dance dance revolution is not dead amongst children
5013420	5018140	You've got to look outside the people that grew up with it because we're all ten years older than we were when the game first
5018140	5024680	Came out but like it's popular still with children children are keeping that series alive. Honestly, you know ten-year-olds love it
5024680	5027960	That's how DDR is not dead. DDR is not what it used to be. Oh,
5029060	5031060	That's that's for sure
5031100	5036560	No, I'll agree with you because I picked up supernova 2 and it's arguably the worst
5037100	5044440	Musically dance dance revolution game I've ever played in my life interesting because I'm not a lot of people necessarily felt the same way
5044660	5048300	You know, like I don't think necessarily was received that poorly by the community
5048300	5052500	But I don't think I don't think people make such a big deal out of these releases anymore
5052500	5056660	like I think universe 2 is coming out soon and it's kind of being met with this big and
5057260	5059260	This is this is it. It's
5059380	5064140	It's not that DDR is a bad game because I know there's a lot of people to work on it and they work very hard
5064140	5069340	On it, but the problem is that DDR has not innovated much in the past years and I've said this
5069340	5072460	I don't know how many freaking times but even when supernova came out
5072460	5073260	It was this you know
5073260	5079460	It's supposed to be this big triumph at DDR is back and it's alive again and they didn't change a goddamn thing with the basic
5079460	5083620	structure of the game and I think DDR really needs a big kick in the booty and
5083940	5089300	the reason why I always praised the ultra mix series on this show previously is that like
5089900	5094360	Three-quarters of the innovative shit you saw on the console games or all coming from the Xbox series
5094660	5101180	Things like quest mode things like song lists reaching out into independent music scene, you know all that stuff
5101180	5105080	that was all innovated by the Xbox team and that's why that
5105080	5112640	that those types of like innovations at least even when they fail because not everything is done very well like the quest mode in universe
5112640	5114640	was god-awful, but
5114680	5119800	You know, I think I give them props for at least trying to innovate a dead game
5120480	5125320	Well, and then the other thing too is that they keep making so many damn games for it
5125320	5130480	I mean seriously if anybody is to blame for killing the series, it's Konami
5130480	5136920	It's because well, let's see this year alone. We had DDR universe come out DDR supernova 2
5137080	5142360	DDR hottest party and we're gonna have DDR universe 2 coming out and then next year already
5142360	5147360	I can think of at least two more games that are coming out in the DDR series one
5147360	5153240	Which is the never talked about DDR Disney mix or just DDR Disney Channel
5154040	5158240	You know, it's crap like that. It's watering this shit down and it's not really innovative
5158240	5164240	It's just let's throw some more songs in there and that's it. But you know, they still sell very well
5164240	5168360	We always sell out of them and you know, if you look in the past, you know
5169120	5171040	Recent well, I don't know about the recent charts
5171040	5176200	but I know that DDR extreme 2 was on the top of charts for a long time or at least supernova was and
5176880	5178840	Supernova 2's not doing bad at all
5178840	5185520	I mean probably their expectations are lower, but you know, I think it's a lot of it is like hottest party
5185520	5188960	Mm-hmm. Yeah use the remote nunchuck. That was crap
5189880	5197120	You know universe I do is gonna be you know, not much more innovative. Okay. Oh great. They brought freestyle mode back
5197120	5202480	It's a game where you don't have arrows fucking awesome. Here's the thing. Okay, Konami
5202480	5207120	I one of my favorite game companies ever. I've known people that have worked there
5207120	5209120	I have great relationships with a lot of folks who work there
5209120	5215680	Here's the here's the thing my honest like friendly advice to the folks at Konami take a page from harmonics
5216360	5222760	Because look at what harmonics did is that basically they were given the challenge of oh look guitar hero got taken away from you
5222760	5228760	But we want to make you we're gonna have you make kind of the same thing and they like took what essentially was kind of
5228760	5230760	the same fucking game and just
5230840	5236880	Really ran away with it and with this rock band and kind of made something completely new out of it and this whole like you
5236880	5243800	Can print your band's t-shirt like this is all like crazy stuff like running away with innovative ideas. I think honestly DDR
5244320	5246320	might want to hire a consultant from
5246640	5248640	harmonics I
5248840	5252740	Don't know what do you think you're doing that I will say you talking about universe
5252740	5256320	I think musical universe is actually one of the best PDR mixes I've ever played
5257520	5264320	It had a great variety of music some things that were poppy that I could actually stand because anybody who knows me
5264320	5269680	And I don't know many people know me that personally. I do not like pop music at all
5271960	5279880	Having having going from slam to 8-bit to don't play nice, which is a song. I actually enjoyed was a lot of fun
5281240	5285320	I agree I agree universe has an excellent song list and that's really what
5286200	5292440	The standard list from supernova 2 without unlocking anything was just a disappointment there was one song
5292440	5297800	I was like huh, this is awesome. Okay. Wait two because I didn't know one song and there was my gold track
5297800	5301720	That was a good song, but rock a fellow skank is the only time I'm like, huh? This is a good song
5301720	5303720	I mean everything else didn't really stand out
5304680	5306840	And it was a bit of a disappointment
5307760	5312280	You know honestly and again I paid nothing for it. So I should complain too much. I
5312960	5318280	Standby that I firmly believe that the best home mix to come out in the US or Japan
5318280	5324880	Anywhere anytime and probably will always be the best TDR game that comes on the home consoles is ultra mix 2 on the Xbox
5324880	5329040	And the reason why I agree that is where they took the most risk
5329040	5335160	They completely changed the people that did the steps to people that really knew the game of DDR inside and out
5335160	5339100	It's where they took some big risks with the song list that paid off in a huge way
5339160	5344440	It's where they added these new modes that changed the game and had that Xbox live
5344680	5347580	Dancing that was kind of explored in the first ultra mix game
5347580	5349920	But it totally improved on with the you know
5351060	5356360	Different types of versus mode in the second game. I don't think there will ever be a game DDR game as good as ultra mix 2
5356360	5357240	period
5357240	5361880	That made me feel that made me feel as excited about DDR as I did when I first played ultra mix 2
5362640	5363880	anyway
5363880	5369720	We got to let you go our times about up, but thanks for the call DMN. Okay. Thanks given guys
5369720	5371720	Were we able to meet your challenge somehow?
5371720	5378320	No, it was a good. It was a good discussion, and I actually wanted to call it and not be a bumbling idiot for once
5378320	5381660	So we appreciate that so we like it
5381660	5386500	We're not a bumbling idiot if they want to hear you being a bumbling idiot. They should just download ol revolution. Oh
5389140	5393940	Hearts no, but it would be saying your name over and over in a song. There's nothing wrong with that
5393940	5400420	But you and drunk drunk revolution seriously WTF OMG WTF bbq. Lol. All right. Bye DMN. All right
5404420	5407740	All right, that's it for the skype line today. We got to close it up
5408340	5411460	So we're gonna get on our way out of here. Okay, last minute, sir
5411460	5416180	Yes, I want to say one more thing because before you before we went to with that call you were talking about
5416180	5423780	as avatar has huge amounts of achievement points very easily and all you have to do is get in the corner you start a
5423780	5429180	New game and you basically back up into a corner and keep hitting one button over and over again and you unlock all
5429780	5435880	1,000 achievement points within two minutes and there's some there's a YouTube of it and it's so fucking easy
5436060	5438940	It's ridiculous. And so I'm sure you're all over this game
5439460	5444300	No, you cheap, but I don't even want to play this game. However, if I happen to run upon this game
5444300	5449500	I'm sure I'll play it for the two minutes that it requires to unlock all achievement points and then throw it aside like I would
5449500	5453700	Normally, all right. Good luck with that Jamie. We'll take your story real quick. They'll get into Loki's remaining stories
5453700	5457900	Um, actually this is for anyone who is waiting for unreal tournament 3 on xbox 360
5457900	5462940	they actually said that it was that it works already and has worked since last spring and
5463660	5469060	That they've actually put on hold any further development on it because of getting it to work on xbox live
5469420	5473780	What about that whole like it's supposed to be on a PlayStation 3 first for like it is going to be out on Windows and
5473780	5474860	PlayStation 3 first
5474860	5481100	Then they're taking Christmas off and are gonna start working on the xbox 360 version so that they can get it to work with mods
5481100	5482460	and everything
5482460	5487460	Interesting. So that's where the delay is, but it works and it has been working and it could be done by now
5487900	5492180	But no, but there's that deal, but there's the deal and there's also, you know
5492180	5494180	The fact that they're trying to get it to work on live
5494460	5496460	All right, Loki anyways
5497260	5502460	Microsoft is doing an offer which it's less cool now because originally we thought it was for everybody
5502460	5509360	but apparently if you own an original xbox and you have a paid xbox live account and if you purchase an
5509580	5516900	Xbox 360 between November 21st and December 21st of this year, you'll be entitled to a free copy of halo 3
5517420	5523380	So you fill out some sort of form and you get a copy mailed to you. Hooray
5525380	5530620	Postal 3 apparently we bowls in the game and you can kill him in the game
5530620	5532620	awesome
5533060	5535060	And then the Wii Zapper
5535620	5543280	Apparently with there is of course some pictures that floated on the internet with some unboxing of that and there is a second
5543620	5548160	Configuration which also begs the question. Why the fuck do you actually need this then?
5548860	5554300	Where do you take the nunchuck basically out of the Wii Zapper and you just hold the Zapper with remote in there?
5554300	5561580	Like you would hold the remote normally so it's a piece of plastic. That's completely useless
5562360	5564360	hooray
5564480	5568180	But we will soon see can I use the Wii Zapper on a we bowl
5569800	5575960	Maybe if they put out postal 3 on the Wii have you played manhunt 2 on the Wii yet? No, I really don't
5575960	5577960	He's just the PSP, huh? Yeah, I
5577960	5584480	Am you know, I was all excited to get it originally when it was adult only and now I'm just like eh, whatever
5584520	5590560	It's just not as controversial anymore. I'll play no more heroes. I'll be pretty cool. But you know, yeah manhunt 2
5590560	5594040	I don't care. All right. Well, that's it for last-minute stories. That's it
5594040	5596400	Then we're gonna go around to get everybody's final thought we can wrap this up
5596400	5602720	We've been running an hour 40 just for part B. So we're over so we got a wrap it up Dark Sakura your final thought I
5603480	5605480	Want pie? Oh
5605480	5609280	Ooh, my final thought is I'm gonna steal Dark Sakura's iPhone
5609840	5612960	No, no is mine, but I also want pie Loki
5613160	5619360	My final thought is I need to take some more extra strength Tylenol. Yay. Sorry to hear about your headache
5620000	5624760	Well, that's it for this week Dark Sakura. Have a good two weeks off. Have fun in Alabama
5624760	5626760	I will maybe I will call you on
5627200	5631320	Sunday sounds good. We I think we originally we're gonna take a week off, but I haven't heard that chatter
5631320	5633440	So I don't think we're I don't think we are gonna do that
5633440	5636680	I think we are gonna be live the next two weeks. So we'll be here doing our thing
5636800	5639840	It could be possible to be here the week after but I might just be dead
5639840	5642760	Yeah, no, no, you know if you need the night off go for it
5642760	5646940	and we'll we'll find some of our local favorites to help fill in and
5647560	5652280	possibly the wheat zapper challenge happens, but if any of our I'm actually gonna be
5653160	5656560	hopefully meeting up with a friend of mine back there who
5656560	5663520	I met again through DDR who I met while I lived out here and then it's nothing is kind of funny
5663880	5669880	So puppies already volunteering to fill in for a night when you're not here. Okay puppy and send me some chocolate
5670160	5674880	Will you allow puppy to sit in the fluffy blue chair when you're happy can sit in the fluffy blue chair
5674880	5679440	All right, it used to be the big green chair the big green monster chair, but now it's the fluffy blue chair
5679760	5681760	It's lightweight and fluffy anyway
5682560	5685760	That's it folks. We got to play the outro and get on out of here
