487	19088	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19764	24348	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, November the 18th of 2007.
25830	29793	By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast, it'll probably be Thanksgiving time.
29853	34558	So to all of our fellow American listeners, happy Thanksgiving and hope you're having a good day today.
34938	39222	To all of our non-American listeners, happy Thursday, whenever that happens to fall for you.
39722	42285	All right, let's go back into the gaming news.
42345	42585	Loki.
43322	45503	Happy Thursday from wherever that happens to fall.
45523	47424	Because I'm thinking in my mind Thanksgiving.
48004	48444	Never mind.
48925	49525	I'm out of it tonight.
49545	51886	I think Thursday lands on the same time of the week each week.
52386	54887	Anyways, not when you have the international date line involved, okay?
55988	57669	It's still the same time each week.
58329	58789	Their time.
58929	59209	Shut up.
59289	59689	I hate you.
60930	71655	So another reason I guess people are kind of bitter, you know, Club Nintendo, this wonderful little program that they have in Japan where they get a bunch of cool free shit that we don't ever see anywhere else around the world.
72165	73826	Super Famicom Super Nintendo Super Famicom
99075	102116	and two 2008 tabletop calendars.
103037	109879	Of course, if you want these, you have until December 2nd to select one of the above items.
110899	118762	But anyways, according to IGN's translation of the site, those Famicom controllers are going to be delivered by April 2008.
120102	121903	But still though, I think those are pretty cool.
123684	125144	Too bad we don't have anything like that over here.
126705	127345	I know, that's...
128402	129082	Very cool.
129142	130743	Why don't they do that over here, you think?
130823	132164	Is it just a money thing?
132384	134324	Too many people would get in on it or what?
135325	137246	Why can't they just do it like a contest or something silly?
137286	138046	Because they don't like us.
138066	138666	I don't know.
138686	139326	They don't like us?
139867	140367	I guess.
140547	145709	Well, God, we buy their freaking Wii's even though they haven't put out that many games this year to support it.
146169	147050	We've stood by them.
147850	149270	We should get something out of it, don't you think?
150031	150231	Nope.
150811	151491	I guess not.
152432	152792	Jerks.
154693	155013	All right.
155073	157734	Well, I'll just continue to play the virtual console games with the...
158578	158878	DarkSakura.com
169232	176535	Well, what's interesting is that there do appear to be some other games coming on board with an upcoming peripheral, and that is the Wii Balance Board.
177055	179296	It's coming out, I believe, early next year with Wii Fitness.
180076	182497	A new game has been announced that will use the Wii Balance Board.
182597	185139	It's Namco Bandai's Family Ski.
186179	190321	Famitsu has recently revealed this game, and it will be compatible with the Wii Balance Board.
190641	197344	Notice that's compatible, not required, but certainly it does look like you'll get to use, you know, Mii-like characters in the game.
197384	198264	I'm sure your own Mii's...
199104	199725	with skiing.
200706	205289	The game is supposedly going to come out winter of this year or 2008 even in Japan.
205610	209973	So kind of interesting the game may actually be out in Japan before the Wii Fit board actually is out.
210554	211234	So kind of cool.
213236	220021	Kind of like how we have DualShock 3 support for PlayStation 3 games over here even though the controllers don't come out until the spring.
220582	220702	Yeah.
222168	222568	What is that?
222969	229313	Odd1 in chat says, oh man, and by the way, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, we always love our chatters, the ever-present fourth host on our show.
229774	234617	Odd1 says, oh man, the Wii balance board is going to be the best way to randomly tackle friends and loved ones ever.
236899	237059	What?
237419	238720	That might be kind of scary, I don't know.
239201	247647	I was going to say that they're also going to have a game in Wii Fit that's going to be a skiing or snowboarding game that's going to use the balance board as well, so...
248553	252956	So wait, are we just going to see a lot of knockoffs of those type of games, kind of like we've been seeing in Wii Sports?
253016	257419	Like, suddenly there's all these golf games and, you know, tennis games.
257439	261602	Well, it's just like when Wii Play came out, hey, we could do shooting gallery type games in this?
261983	263384	Okay, let's make a bunch of them.
264104	264765	That'll suck.
265285	266126	Yay.
267066	271850	Hey, there's nothing wrong with, you know, another skiing game using it, because it's going to be a full, you know...
272665	274266	Fleshed Out version of Skeen.
274446	281389	Now, Namco Bandai is a pretty respected third-party publisher that's not known for doing a lot of these type of knock-off games.
281409	285471	You know how certain third-party publishers are kind of known for being nothing but a bunch of knock-off games?
285851	291174	That's not really Namco Bandai, unless they're knocking themselves off or ripping themselves off with Katamari.
291814	292635	But, you know what I mean.
295636	296497	I think the game will be fine.
297417	301259	Well, this is actually something else that I think a lot of people are looking forward to on Wii.
302500	330872	Okami will be on Wii and it will excuse me that wasn't fun but basically for the folks at Capcom they had actually been asked if Okami was going to have a Wii release before the PS2 version even came out so they were already thinking about it and so they're going to bring it out
332967	333447	And we like widescreen.
333467	333747	Absolutely.
333767	334847	Especially me since I have a TV.
334867	334988	Mm-hmm.
361662	365524	And you know those TVs are going to be more and more out there as this Christmas goes on.
365984	370447	So I think, you know, because that should be a big seller this year now that HD TVs are getting more and more affordable.
370967	372968	I think you're going to see more and more houses have those.
373148	379732	So it'll be kind of interesting to see the gaming scene kind of have to evolve to catch up with that and all the games supporting widescreen.
381533	382714	We're looking at you, Nintendo.
383334	383794	That's right.
384635	386496	And your 480p HD.
387296	387616	Anyways.
388597	388657	Um...
389218	389638	No price drop.
389658	389738	Boo.
417952	418553	No price drop.
418613	421835	I don't think you need a price drop yet unless your system is like sucking.
422496	425018	That's when you start dropping the price of your system.
425178	428841	Drunami in chat says, Beatings will continue until morale improves.
429761	430502	Yay.
432452	433012	Skate or Die
462603	466685	and I know over here we're getting Air Zonk on Monday or Super Air Zonk.
467045	467965	How did you find that out?
468485	469766	Because... You have ways?
470486	477969	No, actually because they announced it on, I believe, the Turbo... There's something like TurboGrafx-16 site that lists a bunch of this crap.
478589	482231	It was officially announced, so... I think we should get that and Skate or Die here.
482251	483111	That would be an awesome week.
483530	484872	Hudson, I'm sure, did it.
484972	487516	What do you think they'll give us for Christmas on a virtual console?
487636	490820	I mean, they could give me Guardian Legend, but I somehow don't think that'll happen.
490980	491261	I don't know.
491301	493424	Have they made a Shrek game on the Super Nintendo?
493444	494425	No, I don't think so.
494926	495667	You know what I want?
495987	496207	What?
496348	497109	Kirby's Avalanche.
499162	501803	Get Dr. Bean Machine or whatever.
501903	504944	But it actually plays differently on the Super Nintendo.
504964	506804	That would be pretty funny.
507024	508204	I'm a whore for P.O.P.O.
508324	510065	Wait, I want to say Kirby's Avalanche is out there.
510525	511825	I'm getting it mixed up with a golf game.
511845	514666	They should have, well, maybe kind of like 1080.
515366	515826	Remember that?
516666	516926	What about 720?
516966	517166	Fuck 720.
517206	519947	1080 was a snowboarding game.
519967	521607	I know, but 720 was a skateboarding game.
521807	522308	What's your point?
524462	525844	It wasn't a very good skateboarding game.
525864	527186	It was an awesome skateboarding game.
527286	527606	Oh, yeah.
527626	528928	You got killed by bees.
529910	530470	Oh, okay.
530490	531252	That's awesome.
531492	532573	That makes it all better.
532694	533715	Yes, it does.
534055	535257	It's got bees in it now.
535397	538301	Okay, Actdeft says Kirby's Ambulance is already on the virtual console.
538802	539283	You missed it.
539303	539663	I didn't see it.
539683	540645	You were sleeping that day.
541684	544425	That's what I get for not playing my Wii for, you know, two weeks.
544765	546646	So Actdeft says both those games are out.
547867	548447	But you know what?
548747	555490	I don't really look at a lot of them so much because I actually have Kirby's Avalanche and a Super Nintendo, but I still kind of want to play it on my Wii.
555970	556570	Well, there you have it.
556610	558071	Christmas comes early for you this year.
558291	558651	Yay!
559531	561152	But no, I want Guardian Legend.
561272	565173	And if they're doing Sega games, then I freaking want Fantasy Zone.
566994	568435	Oh, that would be kind of cool.
568455	569095	Fantasy Zone.
570000	574963	because the Genesis, all you needed was the power base converter to play Master System games on it so you could do it.
575363	577604	You know what game they'll probably give us for Christmas?
578945	581847	Huge selling Nintendo game that Nintendo made.
582667	592173	Big court battle over the rights to the game because somebody else put an off color version of it out first and then Nintendo put a subpar version out themselves.
592213	594494	I bet you you'll see Tetris on Christmas.
594514	595315	I bet you anything.
595335	596875	They should do the Tengen collection.
599073	605954	I somehow doubt that Color Dreams games showing up on my Wii I would set fire to my Wii Those games were ass
607234	609596	But Tengen Tetris was so much better.
609676	610436	That game was cool.
610456	610837	I'll give you that.
610857	612478	Tengen, I didn't mind them so much.
612498	614339	Those were just basically Atari games like Klax.
614679	615419	Those games were cool.
615840	619942	But the Color Dreams games were also like non-licensed games.
620302	621303	They were ass.
621943	623184	Those games were horrible.
623885	625586	You know actually what game I wouldn't mind?
625606	627207	Oh shoot.
627267	630769	It was on Super Nintendo but I used to play it in the arcade all the time.
630829	631710	It was a caveman game.
631730	632150	Trog.
633851	634151	Really?
634231	634912	Do you remember that one?
635352	635472	No.
635492	635532	No.
636997	637398	I do not.
638018	640079	Alright, well moving on with other virtual console news.
640820	642341	One game in the UK.
643281	643802	One game.
644702	645263	Double Dribble.
645803	647484	At least it's one fucking good game.
647784	647984	Yeah.
648605	650566	Double Dribble is pretty good.
650826	654789	You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but I did play a shitload of Double Dribble.
655229	658971	And NBA Jam was like the all-time greatest basketball game is NBA Jam.
659232	662494	Did you ever play any of the arcade NBA Jams that had the Mortal Kombat hacks?
662514	662694	Of course.
662714	662934	Of course.
664158	664558	Of course.
664778	666720	Scorpion is an unlocked character, absolutely.
667200	669742	And you can play, like, as, you know, the president.
671043	672985	Anyway, how did a double dribble story turn into one?
673005	673765	Because you said NBA Jam.
673785	674366	Yeah, I know.
674526	675286	Your fault, Rob.
675327	676347	Haha, tangent.
676367	677308	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
679850	680190	Anyways.
682972	686295	So, if you're not into double dribble, maybe you're into betting.
686935	690078	And, of course, coming to Super Smash Bros.
690098	691739	Can I bet on double dribble games?
692940	693020	No.
694557	695818	Coming to Super Smash Bros.
695858	699560	Brawl is a spectator mode, and they will have online betting.
700120	700300	Ooh!
700540	702201	Nintendo is encouraging gambling!
702761	703402	Oh my god!
704242	709905	Send out all those stupid, uh, you know, parent groups or whatever.
710545	711465	Let's ban the game.
711826	712146	Now.
713206	715147	It'll get your children knocked up as well.
715487	719229	Isn't spectator mode kind of stupid, though, because you don't know who you're watching?
720670	720790	Maybe.
720810	720930	Maybe.
721397	722037	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
748533	753156	But at least I think if the person is on your friends list, you should be able to see their name, right?
754136	754357	Maybe.
754377	754917	I don't know.
755297	766064	Anyways, it will allow you to observe, of course, players' battles, including the betting system, where you can use your hard-earned coins to wage your own combatants during brawl battles.
766504	768825	And winning can pay off big, of course.
769366	771487	You can also earn stickers.
772970	773610	Hooray!
773831	774591	Stickers!
774671	775632	Like real stickers?
775812	777052	Or fake game stickers?
777172	779254	Or real stickers?
779954	780354	Well, tough.
780634	781535	You don't get real stickers.
783476	786198	And, of course, I don't know.
787658	788959	It sounds neat, I guess.
789439	793702	But once again, I have a feeling that people are going to be like, Hey, you can bet money on it.
795423	796763	I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.
797904	800766	I wonder if you're going to get people throwing matches and stuff.
801815	803196	Like this big underground scheme?
803536	805497	No, you can't, because you don't know who's playing in it.
808238	808618	I don't know.
809818	813800	Odd1 says, all games should have a mechanic by which they mail you stickers.
814220	816921	I don't care if they're not related to the game, I also want stickers.
817121	821303	So are you suggesting we go back to, was it the Activision patch system that they had?
821643	822804	Absolutely.
823364	828466	I mean, if you think about it, Xbox Live achievements are indirectly inspired by the old Activision patch thing.
829457	830577	You know what I think they should do?
831118	831938	Oh, Activision.
832238	834079	Please tell me someone from Activision is listening.
834119	835119	Here's a fabulous idea.
836180	843482	Put all those old Activision games together yet again in one of those bundles, but have the achievements be the old patches you used to get.
844403	848224	Like, you know, when you would get so many points in a game, then you can unlock the little picture of that patch.
848644	849605	That might be kind of cool.
849925	858868	Even though we've seen those Activision packs like a million times for different consoles or whatever, I think one more would be kind of cool for nothing else but that, and maybe put some Xbox Live in it.
860159	862002	and put Oink in it for God's sake.
862542	863203	Oink was awesome.
865167	865427	Sorry.
865948	866148	Rant.
866889	867070	Oink.
870916	874282	Guess what store is promising Wheeze?
875140	875340	T.J.
875480	875621	Maxx
894351	901276	I used to live right next to one, and it's basically just like Ross Dress for Less, but like one step above it.
901556	903457	I don't think it's a step above.
903758	906559	Yeah, I think it's really on the same tier as like Ross Dress for Less.
906880	909822	So how TJ Maxx got Wii bundles is beyond me.
909862	912043	That's what makes this story funny for those that don't understand.
912063	913404	I don't know, is TJ Maxx nationwide?
913424	915786	Yeah, we had him in Mobile.
916066	917327	Oh, okay, then they're pretty nationwide.
917347	917847	They have him here.
918127	920209	It was really ghetto.
920289	920949	Overseas.
921550	922010	It's like...
923223	924504	DJ Maxx is an interesting place.
951448	952449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
968568	972310	I hope you like golf attachments and tennis racket attachments.
972330	975211	And the potato chip holder that will also hold your Wiimote.
975231	977152	They never released that because it sucks.
977192	977932	God damn it.
978433	979693	That thing actually looked kind of cool.
979713	980994	Just buy a damn bowl.
981154	981514	No.
981574	982534	Put your chips in.
982554	985996	You don't need a fucking little thing.
986036	990038	How about we cleanse the palate with the undead?
990891	991151	Okay.
992171	993291	Zombies are great.
993511	994552	I love The Undead.
994612	995772	I mean, loathe The Undead.
996112	996432	I know.
996632	998792	Let's turn zombies loose in TJ Maxx.
999993	1004073	I would totally, totally film that and sell it as a movie.
1004193	1004653	There you go.
1005714	1017215	Anyway, for those of us who love The Undead, who dig their zombies, House of the Dead 2 and 3 are going to be on Wii, using the Wii Zapper.
1018416	1019976	And you can shoot your zombies in the head.
1021949	1026773	But you don't have to press A. Fuck House of the Dead.
1026793	1028354	I want Typing of the Dead on Wii.
1028995	1030656	Now that they support the USB keyboards.
1030816	1031857	Oh, that's true, that's true.
1031897	1034739	Yeah, they put out that patch a while back, and now they support the USB keyboards.
1035400	1037281	But I love House of the Dead.
1038582	1039943	And I love Typing of the Dead.
1040544	1042626	But I had House of the Dead 2 on Dreamcast.
1043566	1044787	That was freaking sweet.
1044807	1046529	I have Typing of the Dead on GameTap.
1046749	1048110	I had Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast.
1048570	1049551	I think I might as well.
1050332	1050432	Um...
1050871	1052612	This new pack is actually kind of neat.
1052852	1062015	I'm seeing Sega releasing some of these gun games, and hopefully they'll release more, because I know with Ghost Squad they started that off, and of course they're going to use the Wii Zapper.
1062775	1072998	The other thing which no one else has really mentioned so far, other than the fact that it's coming out in March, is that it's also going to be priced the same as Ghost Squad, which is $29.99 retail.
1073038	1078480	So you may be thinking, oh hey, $50 for games that don't look that great on the Wii...
1079386	1086511	It's only $30, and it's actually a pretty good collection, and hopefully it's as good as Ghost Squad, because Ghost Squad is pretty fun, and I think a lot of people are going to overlook it.
1086771	1089193	And it's zombies being shot in the face by your Wiimote.
1089253	1089994	I mean, come on.
1090174	1091135	I mean, that is kind of cool.
1091515	1093817	I love shooting zombies.
1094157	1094897	And look at it this way.
1094937	1095678	It's not the movie.
1098600	1100341	Just zombies are great, okay?
1101222	1101943	Zombies are great.
1102123	1102503	That's right.
1102583	1103264	Zombies are great.
1104885	1105165	Anyways...
1106528	1117974	So another thing that you're going to probably be pissed off about, especially if you just bought a DS, is that there's a rumor saying that there's another DS redesign coming your way.
1119254	1131260	In fact, it's supposed to happen after the holiday sales kind of die out, probably next spring, which is kind of interesting because spring is when they released the last revision, the DS Lite.
1132014	1133875	The rumor is that it's thinner.
1133935	1136076	It's not going to have a Game Boy Advance port.
1136416	1139577	It will have onboard storage and larger screens.
1141538	1149242	So... And you know that onboard storage is going to then be used by all the cool games that come out next, so everybody has to upgrade to one of these things.
1149302	1149762	You know what?
1150062	1154064	Nintendo, I just bought this fucking thing like three months ago, and already...
1155373	1156814	You're thinking about making me upgrade.
1157054	1157715	You bastards.
1157795	1161698	I just bought a DS Lite myself, too, so I don't have to play my wife's pink one.
1162318	1163419	I bought a nice black one.
1163840	1165321	Haven't played anything on it, though, yet.
1165441	1167022	I still have my white one, and I like it.
1167603	1169764	But remember, I had to get a pink Advance back in the day.
1170845	1173647	Now, people in the chat room are screaming, rumor, rumor, rumor.
1173707	1176129	Yes, it's a rumor, but honestly, would it surprise you?
1176650	1177750	I mean, really, think about it.
1177790	1178991	Look at Nintendo's track record.
1179912	1182074	I mean, do you see why this is popping up everywhere?
1182254	1183575	I mean, it definitely...
1184588	1185829	That sounds true to me!
1215765	1236244	The Game Boy Advance SP The DS I have all of those too And now one more DS Whatever they're going to call this thing DS Slim and Light They'll call it the DS Uber DS Rape Because that's what I keep feeling Super DS
1238673	1242957	Tiger Claw, oh yes, Tiger Claw says the next version of DS will probably be the DS Micro.
1243457	1244799	And of course, the advanced Micro.
1244819	1245980	I have a Game Boy Micro.
1246000	1248181	You're probably the only person I know that has a Game Boy Micro.
1248202	1249322	And I didn't pay for it either.
1252225	1253606	We're still selling those at work.
1253926	1256729	Or should I say we still have the same 10 that we've had since...
1257555	1258396	Game Boy Micro
1278326	1280087	Like Jamie's Puzzle Fighter, I could see that.
1280127	1282168	But it's got interchangeable fails.
1282228	1284568	I tried playing Kingdom Hearts on it and that did not work.
1284708	1286109	Oh my god, I couldn't read.
1286389	1288810	You know, even worse is playing a shooter on that damn thing.
1289250	1290030	It doesn't happen.
1290711	1293952	You do not play a shooter on...
1295421	1303424	Do you remember back in the day on the old school Game Boys, they used to have the magnify and light things that you could put on top of them, these really hideous things.
1303805	1304505	But they worked.
1304805	1307646	They would slightly magnify the screen and light, and you'd totally get a headache.
1307946	1310587	They need that for the micro, like a magnify thing.
1310767	1313148	Would that kind of defeat the purpose of buying a micro in the first place?
1313908	1314869	You know people would buy it.
1315229	1316329	Because they're dumb, right?
1317230	1317750	There you have it.
1318544	1319245	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1341816	1352939	Microsoft improperly allowed his underage kid to use his debit card to subscribe to Xbox Live and automatically renew the subscription without authorization.
1353820	1358921	He says that in October 2005, this is being done by Francisco Garcia in Georgia.
1359722	1367644	He says in October 2005, his son Silvario used his debit card to buy a $50 one-year subscription to Xbox Live.
1368829	1374190	A year later, Microsoft automatically billed him for an additional year of Xbox Live without his knowledge or consent.
1374971	1381612	And he says that the charge sent his checking account into overdraft and that the bank slapped him with a $35 penalty.
1383033	1388514	This is why you should be careful when using your debit card as a credit card, but never mind.
1390054	1396376	And then the plaintiff goes on to say that Microsoft refunded the subscription fee but would not cover the bank penalty.
1397918	1402603	It actually would be a son that committed fraud because a son would have had to put it in his father's name to go through.
1402623	1406808	Nowhere is it said how in the hell the kid got the debit card in the first place.
1420202	1421282	But I guess that's not important.
1421802	1434685	Garcia goes on to say that Microsoft broke Georgia law when it allowed his kid to use a debit card to sign up for Xbox Live and then continue to break the law when it renewed the service without written authorization.
1434745	1443047	He's speaking unspecified damages and asking the court to broaden the case to include all Xbox Live customers in Georgia with similar problems.
1443067	1446848	So in other words, kids that steal their dad's wallet and use the cards to buy things.
1447998	1450219	It's not Xbox's fault.
1452019	1458241	In fact, I've seen how hefty the authorization process is to that because I couldn't use my debit card.
1458361	1461121	I had to use one of my other credit cards to run it through.
1461902	1465623	So first of all, they're very specific on putting in the information.
1465643	1469824	You have to have the complete billing information for the person who owns the card.
1470244	1470704	Therefore...
1471724	1474826	It is not Microsoft's fault.
1475386	1479689	It's, first of all, that guy's fault for letting his kid be able to get into his wallet so easily.
1480449	1484092	And second of all, it's the kid's issue for basically committing fraud.
1484852	1486073	Oh, but yet there's more.
1486453	1489155	Actually, technically, that's borderline on identity theft.
1489235	1490976	Oh, you want to hear about the kid committing fraud?
1491016	1491496	Here's more.
1491556	1492337	Here's more, Jamie.
1493012	1505476	Microsoft has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, saying that they have paperwork that proves that the child misrepresented his age when he subscribed to Xbox Live by falsely stating that he was 18 years old.
1506136	1506476	Uh-huh.
1508617	1513058	Well, even though he would have had to have done it under his parents' name for it to have gone through.
1514679	1517099	It's, it's... What's the chatroom saying?
1517119	1517619	Sorry, chatroom.
1517940	1519240	DarkDeadSuya says...
1520015	1521317	Nevermind credit card.
1521337	1523059	This is why condoms were invented.
1524440	1525421	That is brilliant.
1526042	1527384	Our chatter of the week, everybody.
1527444	1528585	Dark Tetsuya, everybody.
1528625	1529266	Round of applause.
1529326	1529686	Thank you.
1530107	1530628	Hooray.
1530768	1531689	Loki, no comments?
1532796	1533617	That's just an idiot.
1533737	1534498	I mean, seriously.
1534918	1539722	He didn't notice the charge was on his credit card in the first place, and then it rebuilt itself.
1539802	1540883	Well, seriously.
1540983	1542324	How do you do something like that?
1542484	1551392	And this is funny, though, because this must have been on an original Xbox account, because now, if your account runs out, all that happens is it turns into silver again.
1551673	1552173	Exactly.
1552433	1554275	It doesn't have an auto-renew option.
1554315	1554855	You have to renew it.
1554875	1555816	There is no auto-renew.
1555836	1557738	That auto-renew thing was...
1558058	1559378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1584586	1588927	or let your kid steal it in the first place and put it on there and then not do anything about it the first time.
1588967	1591348	I mean, a year went by between.
1592028	1593329	I don't think this case has a lot of chances.
1593349	1597110	And it's not Microsoft's fault that your bank account was so low that you overdrafted.
1597230	1598070	So you know what?
1598710	1603531	If you didn't want to overdraft, use a real credit card that would have denied it if it was going to hit your limit.
1604232	1605232	Although I kind of agree.
1606554	1611457	The bank should have denied the charge, but at the same time, this is how banks make money off of people who overdraft.
1611537	1613217	Let's face it, that's one huge way they make money.
1613257	1620781	Well, on top of that, there's often times where a bank will write off an overdraft charge if it was erroneous, if it can be proven.
1621361	1628105	So, it's just really a case of this man in Georgia being a complete and utter moron.
1629025	1629526	End of story.
1632187	1633267	You deserve that $35 charge, dumbass.
1635197	1635277	F.U.
1635317	1635497	Time F.U.
1635517	1635657	Time
1661272	1669719	The first F you goes towards this man in the black Toyota truck who pulled out of the gas station and into my lane and cut me off.
1670619	1672020	You are a stupid piece of shit.
1673281	1676844	And, you know, you totally deserve to have that, you know, cop car pull you over.
1677144	1678986	So, that was a winner.
1680587	1681207	Alright, Loki.
1682228	1684670	Um, my... Oh, it's two part, I'm sorry.
1684690	1686011	F you to Rob.
1686131	1687953	I thought you said that was mine.
1688133	1689194	And then I was like, okay.
1689514	1690615	Okay, well, that's okay.
1690715	1690975	You go.
1691684	1692104	I'll be nice.
1692665	1693025	You sure?
1693605	1693945	Yes.
1694185	1695746	Alright, and I guess the two-part is F.U.
1695786	1695886	Rob.
1695906	1696407	Well, F.U.
1696447	1696807	Jamie!
1696927	1697347	How's that?
1697367	1699528	You're cutting in front of Loki to say F.U.
1699568	1699868	Jamie.
1699908	1700329	Your mom.
1700669	1701189	Last night.
1701309	1701689	In bed.
1702050	1702370	Loki.
1702790	1709073	I don't really have much to be angry about, but I am annoyed at the Priuses that were driving in front of me today.
1709113	1711375	Apparently, owning a Prius means you drive slow.
1712035	1716257	So, screw you, Prius owners, and I don't give a shit if you're helping the environment.
1716698	1718659	You're not helping the environment because you're making me late.
1719559	1720239	Or later.
1721060	1721140	So.
1723113	1727595	F you to the macaroni and cheese pizza at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza because that shit was nasty.
1728156	1728656	It was good!
1728676	1731818	The macaroni and cheese pizza was nasty.
1731838	1733419	The macaroni and cheese pizza was good.
1733439	1735820	The peanut butter pizza was kind of weird.
1736760	1738221	I liked the peanut butter pizza too.
1739302	1741023	But the best was the barbecue chicken.
1741043	1743584	The barbecue chicken Alfredo was okay.
1744205	1745886	It makes the Incredibly Shitty Pizza not that shitty.
1745926	1747767	I liked the macaroni and cheese pizza though.
1747827	1748747	Yeah, you're weird.
1748867	1749908	F you to Jamie twice.
1750547	1755548	Yeah, well, F you back to your... F you infinity, plus one.
1755848	1757648	Yeah, you can't add plus one to infinity.
1758469	1760109	Because infinity is already infinity.
1760129	1761169	Well, I just did.
1761189	1762829	What are you going to do, tell God to smite me?
1768291	1770091	Sometimes the chat room just needs to be here.
1770111	1772231	That silence, by the way, was Jamie actually praying.
1772952	1775412	I know that was great radio, boys and girls, but there you have it.
1776805	1780368	I want to point out though real quick about some of the previous stories.
1780768	1785191	GS68 had a great comment about the whole father and the kid thing.
1785731	1790374	The father should cut his credit card and stab his kid with one of his sharp edges.
1794957	1795357	I don't know.
1795417	1798719	I almost think GS68 might have just taken the crown of Chatter of the Week.
1799080	1801861	We might have to have a good old fight over this.
1803582	1804063	Good times.
1804383	1805103	Anyways...
1806482	1808023	Flashback Consoles
1835738	1837999	Oh, okay.
1838139	1843560	But anyways, you know, what, they had such wonderful series that they sold off to Ubisoft Driver.
1843580	1844560	Ooh, that was awesome.
1845340	1846400	Such a wonderful game.
1846420	1847460	It had no flaws at all.
1847841	1848721	Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.
1850461	1852121	Stuntman, that was okay.
1852942	1863984	But anyways, so yeah, the Test Drive series has been now licensed to InfoGames, which had, if I remember correctly, didn't they have the really cool, like, theme song that they made for their company?
1865560	1868702	I'm sorry, it wasn't cool at all, but it was a theme song for their company.
1870684	1874026	You know how I knew Atari was going downhill about 15 years ago?
1875027	1878609	Did you ever play a game in the arcades called Pit Fighter?
1879890	1881351	I remember Pit Fighter!
1881391	1884714	I think this game was Atari, yes?
1886135	1887696	No, I don't think it was Atari.
1887756	1888517	Was it Atari?
1888657	1889097	It sucked.
1889157	1894641	But it was Mortal Kombat digitized, you know, type.
1895293	1896474	Game Game Game Game
1921864	1923426	Yay, Jenga.
1923766	1925368	Who thought that was a good idea?
1926430	1929173	Odd1 says, Pit Fighter for Super Nintendo.
1929253	1931516	Proof that I was stupid as a child.
1934579	1935500	It's okay, Odd1.
1936855	1939876	Seriously, Jenga, what the hell were you thinking?
1940196	1944838	I mean, it's hard enough to play the game as it is, but oh, let's play it the way, that'll be even easier.
1945839	1953782	Because everyone wants to play, the only reason that people aren't playing Jenga is because it isn't set under the sea or in some fantastic fictional world.
1953842	1955383	That's why people aren't playing Jenga.
1955643	1958404	Not because, you know, it's Jenga or anything.
1960291	1961991	Seriously, look at this box art.
1962031	1966212	Here's the Sega Genesis version, which was put out by Tengen and, yes, developed by Atari.
1966652	1967212	Look at this.
1968533	1971833	I forgot about the Dominatrix lady fighter they had in it.
1971973	1974054	I mean, this is a horrible fucking game.
1974154	1975614	Why is the guy just in his underwear?
1976094	1977694	Because that's what they wore when they fought.
1977714	1980275	It was panties.
1981295	1982555	Dominatrix fighter.
1982575	1983416	They would be manties.
1983936	1984716	Yes, manties.
1986129	1987210	Digitized Mantis.
1987230	1989072	That's what you have to look forward to in Pit Fighter.
1989493	1991255	Well, good riddance, Atari.
1992036	1992997	Your time is up.
1993257	1994478	Your 15 minutes are over.
1994899	1995199	All right.
1995840	1999524	Well, Loki jumped the gun a little bit because we were actually supposed to have the mailbag segment before that.
1999624	2000045	Eh, whatever.
2000125	2000585	That's all right.
2001206	2003188	We can be fluid here on the show.
2003288	2005491	We can change things around on the fly.
2006204	2008185	So, DarkSakura, are you ready to do some mailbags?
2008625	2008845	Sure!
2009025	2017128	Alright, when you send us emails at mailbag.orangelongeradio.com, Jamie will read the emails and she'll pick out her favorite emails and read them.
2017288	2019429	And that's what she's going to do right now here on the program.
2020029	2020949	Let's open up the mailbag.
2027892	2033594	First email comes from Robert M.
2034494	2038295	who is a regular writer, I would say, to our station.
2041816	2053560	And actually, I have a slight problem with my email because what happened is I had a problem with Firefox doing its... I'm going to close a new thing again!
2053980	2055961	And it didn't reload all the windows, so let's go back to this.
2057318	2063466	Just to clarify last week's letter, while playing the game to a podcast would indeed be a bizarre-
2075362	2079963	Let's say I listen to OLR Part A, 30 songs play days through my break at work.
2080303	2084204	I listen to 20 more songs, followed by a viewing of the latest Ask a Ninja episode.
2084644	2090126	Once I sync my iPod to my computer, but the iPod and iTunes will completely forget that 50 songs and podcasts have been played.
2090766	2091786	I'm not sure why this is.
2091886	2094747	I have the 5th generation 30GB model, if that makes any difference.
2096027	2100508	Secondly, any idea by Nintendo doesn't add an option to view the most recently added Miis.
2101289	2112572	Since two of the four options, one of which is the default, show that most popular Miis assumes that the most popular Miis can only get more popular and the newer ones get entirely overlooked.
2113312	2115793	If you ever see any Miis who look vaguely like members of the U.S.
2116213	2117733	whose line is it anyway, let me know.
2118333	2125335	Looking forward to your next show, Robert M. That would be nice, but it'll never happen because they're lazy.
2126715	2129576	That has been sort of proven.
2129676	2130096	Next one.
2131805	2145355	and actually we got an email from someone who's asking technical questions on the station which I will actually be replying to off of the air but I'm acknowledging that we received one from DJ Mikey Mike which I think is actually kind of funny.
2147357	2159627	Then we got a review of a game from Xenocore who actually sent the email about Ore no Riori which we had Rob look up and
2161155	2167224	Hey Ola, the Xbox 360 controller is a good addition to my control set for my PC.
2167744	2169827	I use it for my classic games quite often.
2169907	2173052	However, I wonder if anyone else is having the same issue that I am.
2173533	2177198	Whenever I test the inputs for the controller, both triggers seem to be on the same axis.
2177870	2181993	If I use the left trigger, the axis goes to 0%, and if I pull the right one, it goes to 100%.
2182273	2184815	Pull both of the axes, it stays at 50%.
2186056	2190659	Also, the right stick will only show movement in the low left to high right diagonal.
2190859	2192701	I can't use it as a second analog control.
2192801	2193281	What the fuck?
2194022	2196423	I thought Microsoft made PC controls better than this.
2196784	2200326	Hopefully, it's just the crack my roomie snuck into my food.
2201487	2202128	One more thing.
2202488	2202588	Hmm?
2204179	2213929	Since my question had folks guessing, allow me to tell you why I seek the knowledge that I do with a quick review of Ore no Ryori for the PS1 Japan.
2214650	2218294	My cooking, as it is known in the US, is a DualShock-centered cooking simulation.
2218875	2226443	The player is a head chef of a cooking establishment that has you preparing various dishes depending on the restaurant's theme, ramen, fast food, etc.,
2227429	2233511	To use the first stage as an example, you take the customer's order as they walk in, start the soup for the ramen, chop the vegetables for the ramen, the thinner the better.
2234031	2239012	One stick is used for your hand position, the other controls the chef's knife.
2239653	2244794	You take the soup off of the heat before it burns, you put the ramen in the brim, blah blah, okay, you cook ramen.
2245594	2248435	The game comes in here, you have six seats that can be full at one time.
2248855	2252316	Managing what you work on and when is the name of the game.
2252416	2254397	Fall behind in your prep time, your orders will pile up.
2255021	2259804	Hey, isn't there a flash game like that on Yahoo?
2261205	2262326	Except you're just serving people.
2262846	2263386	Diner Dash?
2263586	2264347	Diner Dash, that's it.
2265828	2268109	While you were running the restaurant, other random events occurred.
2268129	2271551	These show up as attacks on the other players in versus mode.
2272051	2273232	A customer may leave without paying.
2273252	2280757	You have to chase him down, kill the roaches that flood into the restaurant with your shoe, call the police on wandering drunks that enter the restaurant, and washing dishes.
2281637	2282798	There's a link here on that.
2283393	2284433	The game is a blast to play.
2284453	2290896	If you like Cookie Mama and want to feel like a short order cook from Rolf House, give this game a shot.
2290956	2292577	It makes Cookie Mama look like a walk in the park.
2292617	2295358	DarkSakura, this game is especially worthy of a spot in your import collection.
2295738	2295998	Maybe.
2296759	2299920	Hopefully you won't kick Cookie Mama to the curb after playing this one.
2300400	2301861	As always, keep up the good work on the show.
2301881	2302741	Yours truly, Xenocore.
2303802	2305642	Ranma is suggesting Iron Chef for the Wii.
2306323	2309044	And SonOfDad in chatroom is suggesting Hell's Kitchen for the Wii.
2310004	2310624	I would check it out, yeah.
2310644	2310805	Why not?
2310825	2311705	People do play stuff on PS1.
2333447	2334448	Howdy, OR!
2335049	2338853	I've heard Sky mention a fondness for old-school Zork and an enthusiasm I share.
2339233	2345099	I thought you guys might be interested in this, and this is www.ifcomp.org, I-F-C-O-M-P.
2345900	2349744	It's one of the few yearly contests this one just wrapped up for Homebrew Text Adventures.
2350665	2355890	There's quite a community out there of interactive fiction enthusiasts.
2356443	2364625	I've designed a half-assed IF game or two, but never finished anything, so I think that these intrepid designers deserve a round of applause.
2365165	2367366	I encourage anyone interested in the medium to check it out.
2367946	2372267	It can be used in some fascinating ways and often surpasses gaming in story and character development.
2372607	2373687	Anywho, keep keeping on.
2373747	2374347	You guys rock.
2374407	2374807	Atreyu.
2375227	2380429	You know, I want to say about a year ago, there was somebody that did an Orange Lounge Radio Text Adventure game.
2380469	2381729	I seem to remember playing it.
2382310	2384791	Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki Yeah, it's this question again.
2412677	2415459	What's the story behind them and when did you start using those names?
2415640	2421565	As for mine, Osfer, it's simply a cross between Zephyr, one of my favorite Bimani songs, and Austin, which is my real name.
2423106	2425148	Well, I guess you wanted us to know if we were reading it online.
2425829	2429092	Random comment, Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions is my new anti-drug.
2429252	2429972	Thanks, Osfer.
2430433	2430833	P.S.
2432174	2435938	I know that you'll do what you want, but I still insist Restore for the Sega Genesis.
2436542	2439585	I've tried to describe this game to people and I get weird looks, but trust me, it's a gem.
2439625	2439945	Play it.
2440105	2440806	I know, I've played it.
2441366	2443208	PPS, Yara, sponsored by Kmart.
2444048	2446971	P-P-P-S, I want to hear Loki rant in an English accent.
2448692	2452135	Well, maybe we can get Loki to tell us about his name in an English accent.
2452355	2453456	No, I'm not doing that.
2453856	2455558	Why don't you give us a jolly old story?
2456699	2457880	I'm not even trying tonight.
2459081	2460162	Alright, tell us about your name.
2461102	2462864	It's named after a Norse god.
2463384	2465266	I started using it when I was playing Cusar.
2466527	2466868	A lot.
2468048	2469810	OMG, you didn't get it from Dogma?
2470610	2470750	No.
2470890	2473572	Actually, if anything, I got it from The Mask.
2475574	2475894	All right.
2476334	2476794	There you have it.
2477455	2481378	Well, mine was... I used to be a Japanese major when I lived in Alabama.
2481698	2482218	Go fig.
2482659	2485701	I was actually going into the JET program, which is why I was doing it.
2485821	2494006	But our teacher decided that she would give all of us names in Japanese in class so that when we were...
2495285	2498228	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2521112	2522812	Because you were emo.
2524253	2525333	This was pre-emo.
2526093	2528074	Yes, but you're always on the cutting edge, Jamie.
2528334	2528654	I am.
2529234	2549800	But the other funny thing about this is that I met somebody on AOL who went by EvilSakura who was mad at me for getting DarkSakura, but it turned out her boyfriend knew Dan because Dan at the time had RichterDX, as in DraculaX, and
2550572	2550993	and DarkSakura.com
2560862	2561422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2590748	2592869	But that name is taken on a lot of sites.
2592929	2596451	Apparently there are five other green skies out there, so it's hard to use that name.
2596831	2599593	So at one point I decided to spell sky differently.
2599713	2602875	So you put an I-E instead of Y. So it was green sky.
2602935	2604836	And then one day I said, I'm not green anymore.
2604976	2605836	So it was just sky.
2606737	2609339	And that's the real deal, like how my name came about.
2609399	2611160	It's just one constant evolution after another.
2611480	2614882	So it's not ski or grenski or whatever people say.
2615042	2616042	It's just sky.
2616523	2616823	That's it.
2618793	2628038	And to tell GZDR4EV, I actually had the name before there was a Dark Sakura, before there was a Sakura in Street Fighter.
2629299	2635002	I was in college in 94, no, I started taking Japanese in early 95.
2636143	2637523	So this predates.
2637643	2644327	However, I did think it was funny that there was a Dark Sakura later, and I said that I should sue Capcom for name infringement.
2644627	2644847	You should.
2644867	2645327	It was a joke.
2645347	2645748	You should.
2645768	2646128	You should.
2646874	2647534	That'd be fun to watch.
2670498	2674379	That's right, gaming news out of Brazil, and this is actually pretty awesome.
2675499	2687243	It's this company called TechToy, and what they're doing is that they're basically licensing from Sega the right to make an official portable Genesis, or if you will, Mega Drive.
2687743	2693264	It's an official portable Mega Drive, and it has a little controller and three buttons on it.
2693364	2698506	I would say it looks like a Game Boy Micro, but bigger, and it has the buttons on it, and it has 20 games.
2701046	2709672	Alex Kidd, Sonic & Knuckles, Golden Axe, Echo the Dolphin, and of course the color of the unit is blue, just like Sega.
2709712	2712254	The 20 games are already pre-installed on the unit.
2712874	2717337	Unfortunately, you can't add to them or take away from them once you have the 20 games.
2717357	2717998	That's all you get.
2718878	2723101	It runs on three AAA batteries.
2723782	2724442	Kind of interesting.
2725223	2727764	It will cost about the Brazilian equivalent of $100 US.
2729702	2734905	December 5th is the day it comes out, just in time for Brazilian Christmas, which there will be no snow.
2734945	2736086	I'll tell you something about that.
2736526	2737106	Well, there might be.
2737146	2741469	Brazil's a big country, and there's lots of mountain ranges, but I think it's the other time of year over there.
2742129	2752655	Well, something about that is that actually Dan was pointing out to me, and this was a couple years ago that he pointed out to me, is that the Sega Master System actually still has a very big following in Brazil.
2753644	2771535	and because a lot of the Master System sites that he found or even a lot of ROMs that he found when we both used to be heavy into emulation were games that were Genesis games that we knew on the Genesis but had been put out for Master System because they had come out over there on Master System.
2772145	2776587	I think all of our Brazilian listeners, of which there ought to be a few, because Brazil's a big fucking place, right?
2776987	2778488	It's just as big as the U.S.
2778568	2779088	almost, right?
2779428	2786451	So I think all our, if not bigger, Brazilian listeners should get together and pool money enough.
2786511	2792733	If everybody chips in, let's say there's 10 people listening to Brazil, I'll chip in $10 and send us one of these, because it sounds kind of funnish.
2793314	2794974	I'll fully pay for one.
2795955	2799136	Let me know what the ratio is, and I'll totally pay for one.
2799636	2799936	Nice.
2800857	2801197	I want one.
2802011	2805232	I want one too, but I don't want to have to pay for it because I'm cheap.
2807853	2808113	All right.
2809253	2809633	We'll see.
2810374	2813014	Anyhow, so that's all I got to say on the portable Mega Drive.
2813034	2814075	It is out in Brazil.
2814575	2815415	Or coming out soon.
2815895	2818376	Well, this makes me a very, very sad panda.
2818396	2819416	What?
2819456	2820377	Although I'm not a panda.
2821997	2823118	It makes you a sad Jamie?
2823178	2824318	It makes me a sad me.
2825178	2825858	But not an MII.
2825938	2826599	All right, what is it?
2827159	2827579	Stuff!
2827599	2827739	Stuff!
2829696	2833398	Marvel Universe Online, there's actually a rumor of cancellation going out.
2833618	2839961	It's been stated that the MMO has run into, quote, serious, potentially stalling developmental troubles.
2841062	2847845	Of course, I find it funny that my reference here, which is on Joystick, said that probably because everyone wants to be Wolverine.
2849946	2850366	Not me!
2850766	2852807	So apparently it wasn't Banjo-Kazooie.
2854248	2856930	Oh, is that the big name game that looks like it's getting cancelled?
2856990	2857670	Marvel, huh?
2858070	2859852	Was that supposed to be an Xbox 360 exclusive?
2860192	2861693	I thought it was on PS3 and Xbox.
2861813	2862053	No.
2862613	2862793	Oh.
2863174	2866335	That is a big deal then, because that was like Xbox's MMO.
2866496	2868837	It was only going to be playable on that system.
2868997	2873080	Yeah, because it wouldn't have totally been just exactly like City of Heroes or anything like that.
2874360	2875201	But it would have been Marvel.
2875241	2876061	It might have been kind of cool.
2877402	2878143	No.
2878363	2878683	We'll see.
2880270	2881632	I want to see a fighting game.
2881872	2883814	I need to do that Mortal Kombat vs. DC.
2884094	2884855	That'd be pretty cool.
2885496	2890081	Anyways, so the King Kong game is coming out here pretty soon.
2890762	2892604	Wait, the King of Kong game?
2892944	2893324	DVD.
2893645	2895647	I think Donkey Kong came out like 20 years ago.
2895707	2897669	Hey, they're going to make a game based on this movie.
2897689	2898150	You watch.
2899159	2903122	There's a lot of bad ideas out there and people are waiting to jump on that stuff.
2903382	2905664	Orange Lounge Radio, bringing you the late breaking news.
2905684	2910207	Oh, hey kids, did you hear about that totally rad Donkey Kong that's coming out?
2911769	2914731	No, listen dude, okay, the King of Kong game, okay?
2915191	2917072	You'll play as the people playing Donkey Kong.
2917213	2919354	This is like even better than Donkey Kong.
2919754	2921456	Because you're playing people playing Donkey Kong.
2923097	2925419	Anyways, so yeah, the DVD's coming out...
2926445	2928286	Soon, in January.
2928346	2929506	Being put out by New Line.
2929606	2931567	Actually, we're doing something at our work for this thing.
2932087	2935128	They're having me set up some sort of Donkey Kong competition.
2936129	2937369	Are you going to have the guys there?
2938609	2938669	No.
2938689	2939210	They should come.
2939370	2940430	No, we're low budget, okay?
2941010	2945852	They asked me to download the virtual console game, yet I see no monies for this.
2946112	2950354	They said they'll pay me back later, and then they're going to put it on our big theater screen.
2950914	2951254	But, um...
2952185	2956766	Anywho, so yeah, it's going to be coming out apparently January 29th.
2960147	2962167	But it'll be out on the internet long before.
2963688	2968149	Probably as soon as screeners come out for that and people pirate that shit like crazy.
2968329	2970569	I'm sure there's already a version that's one of those cameras.
2970609	2972330	The question is, why would you want to pirate this?
2972350	2973010	I mean, seriously.
2973630	2974830	I've heard it's a good movie.
2975010	2978031	It's a good movie, but seriously, is it worth wasting a DVD for me?
2978631	2978891	Come on.
2980687	2981349	I want to see it.
2981530	2983115	You should not talk negatively about this.
2983175	2985182	I'm not talking negatively about it.
2985222	2986387	I'm just saying, no, it's like...
2987688	2988028	I don't know.
2988048	2990489	It would be like pirating Geely.
2990729	2995290	The one crazy dude we met at all games, I think, is in this movie, Mr. Awesome.
2995751	2997551	Was he there when you and I both went?
2997991	2999812	I know there was one time I went down there and he was there.
2999832	3002033	I think it might have been a different time when I was there by myself.
3003493	3005094	It might have been just you because I don't remember.
3005234	3005594	I think so.
3005614	3007854	I was there one time by myself because I was there on a trip.
3008255	3009755	I think he was in the movie.
3010335	3012556	Obviously, I'd remember someone named Mr. Awesome.
3014229	3015850	I mean... Wasn't he at... Was he at E3?
3015890	3016971	He was probably at E3 that year.
3017111	3017872	Fuck if I know.
3017892	3018713	I don't know.
3018733	3021054	Someone named Mr. Awesome needs to be punched in the face.
3021995	3022756	I mean, seriously.
3023096	3024337	I'm Mr. Awesome!
3024357	3025278	Oh, you're gonna die.
3025638	3028760	This guy... was interesting.
3028800	3030282	There's really no other word to describe.
3030322	3032583	He was one of the most interesting fellows I've ever met.
3033204	3034505	Oh, I'm sure he was interesting.
3034525	3035426	You're all retarded!
3035826	3038528	No, just... I'm not gonna talk negatively, Loki.
3038548	3039849	We're not gonna have that on this program.
3040389	3041230	He was just interesting.
3043072	3043172	Um...
3044844	3050368	Also interesting is the fact that another movie is being made into a hip new game.
3050708	3051689	Ghostbusters!
3051789	3054691	But I'm not talking about that old ass Commodore 64 game.
3054751	3055871	Although that game was rad.
3056272	3058753	That was one of the first Commodore 64 games I ever remember owning.
3059073	3061375	And I believe this was on the 2600 and all the other systems.
3061635	3064457	But there was a new Ghostbusters game coming out.
3064517	3065658	It's not a remake of the old one.
3065678	3067519	It's a brand new Ghostbusters game.
3068360	3071703	This being previewed by an issue of Game Informer Magazine.
3072003	3076187	Apparently some game footage has already hit the internet, although it's kind of a bit of a rumor.
3076627	3077888	No, it's been confirmed.
3077969	3083053	If you go to GhostbustersGame.com, there's a bunch of stuff there too.
3084614	3091835	Anyway, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films, since they never did make a Ghostbusters 3, and now the actors are getting kind of old.
3092235	3094716	Well, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films.
3095376	3102977	Zootfly is developing it, and we don't know exactly what platforms it'll be on, but you can probably guess it'll be most of the next-gen systems.
3103397	3109919	I do kind of hope, though, it's on Wii, because I think that would be fun to try and not cross the streams on the Wii, with the whole zapping things.
3110919	3112559	I don't know if it might be coming out on the Wii.
3112799	3114080	Here's the other great thing about it.
3114220	3118942	Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, they are all actually a part of the game.
3119363	3122484	They're apparently writing the script and doing all the voiceovers.
3122884	3124805	So that is kind of cool to know that it's authentic.
3125226	3127287	Please don't suck this game.
3127307	3129788	I don't know if Zootfly is actually developing it, though.
3129828	3131709	I know that they were doing something similar.
3131809	3133070	I think this is actually NVIDIA.
3133110	3134991	It's the same team that worked on... Oh my bad, I'm sorry.
3135031	3136712	It was originally rumored at Zootfly.
3136772	3140714	It's the same team that put together the Scarface game, so, you know.
3142657	3143898	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3158100	3158781	GameGame.com
3174119	3174699	That's pretty good.
3175640	3177560	I'm going to try and find... Here's the game.
3177600	3178961	Okay, this looks like the game itself.
3180122	3180402	Oh, good.
3180462	3181722	It's not like an actual first person.
3181782	3182502	I can't listen to this.
3182522	3182983	But it looks cool.
3183003	3184243	It looks like Resident Evil, but like Ghostbusters.
3184263	3187044	What I like about it is that it's an over-the-shoulder view and not a first person.
3200424	3202265	I just think that's highly inappropriate to do to give me such subpar...
3230959	3244346	I have noticed something that if you try to click on the video in window to the next sometimes it'll leave the old thing copied.
3244946	3245546	Brilliant.
3245646	3247227	That happened to me with the paddle cap.
3248127	3248788	Okay, here we go.
3249348	3251449	Somebody grade out the G4 part in the beginning.
3251489	3251969	That's great.
3252309	3253410	I approve of this link.
3260285	3261226	That does look kind of fun.
3261266	3262167	I hope that is the Wii.
3264308	3265209	That's a 360.
3265289	3266831	Yeah, the graphics look very 360.
3267211	3267551	They do.
3268152	3271715	Keep going because there's a part where they show the Stay Puft Marshmallow.
3272075	3272455	Yes!
3274657	3276138	Wow, they shot him in the face.
3277239	3280822	That game looks like it's going to be kind of fun.
3283705	3284005	Wow.
3284665	3285126	Very cool.
3285806	3286407	I would play it.
3289534	3290655	But guess what else I would play?
3290895	3293838	What else would you play?
3295419	3295940	Luminous.
3296800	3297821	Luminous is a good game.
3297881	3298702	I would play that too.
3299162	3300464	Luminous is coming to Windows.
3301645	3301985	Wow.
3302145	3303006	Is it going to have Shinen?
3303686	3304187	It better.
3305688	3309171	And it better have Heavenly Star and it better have everything else that's awesome about it.
3309932	3311793	But yeah, it's going to be on Windows.
3312754	3313435	So isn't that cool?
3314093	3314733	That's kind of cool.
3314813	3321096	Although, then again, if you think about it, Luminous has been whored on every other thing out there, including my cell phone, so this does kind of make sense.
3321896	3323357	I need Luminous for my iPhone.
3324557	3326198	Give me Luminous on my iPhone, I'll be happy.
3326818	3327779	Keep on dreaming.
3327819	3332621	Now, you know what would be cool is a version of Luminous on your iPhone that uses the songs from your iPhone.
3332661	3333441	That would be cool.
3333461	3334202	That would be cool.
3334962	3335362	There you go.
3336002	3342045	Something not so cool is apparently R-Type Command, which is better known as
3342680	3343641	R-Type Tactics
3361870	3380941	It's being put out by Atlas, and I believe, if I remember correctly, it says, the game requires, or it says, excuse the lightning-fast reflexes needed to avoid enemy fire, instead offering a turn-based, hex-based strategic gameplay.
3382702	3385624	You will not just control one ship, but a fleet of ships.
3386865	3387225	I don't know.
3387725	3388646	It sounds stupid to me.
3389918	3391298	If it's tactics, it sucks.
3391399	3391559	Awesome!
3391579	3393359	If by awesome you mean not at all, then yeah.
3412737	3415299	Alright, yeah, not a game I'm very interested in checking out.
3415319	3418301	I mean, our type is cool and all, but it's not that cool, let's face it.
3418882	3424666	Skype line, open for business, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us for all the details.
3424786	3430991	Our Skype name is Orange Lounge Radio, and our telephone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3431031	3432292	You know how long we've been doing Skype?
3432412	3433212	A long time.
3433312	3437235	I think we are actually like one of the first shows ever that use Skype.
3437836	3440858	Maybe the first, I don't know if we can stake that claim, but it might be worth a shot.
3441644	3442585	Let's go to the phones!
3443245	3444466	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3445546	3446286	This is Jason.
3446607	3446827	Hello!
3446847	3449028	The awesome, the awesome, the Jason, or something like that.
3449188	3451989	The ex-awesome Jason, ex-awesome V, what's up?
3454371	3458113	I was kind of curious, has anybody ever played Marble Mania on the Wii?
3458793	3460154	Marble Mania on the Wii?
3460254	3460774	Marble?
3461594	3463715	Kororimpa Marble Mania, or Marvel?
3463735	3466397	Yes, Kororimpa Marble Mania.
3467114	3473657	I have played Kororimpa, and my old roommate, known as Extifer on this program, was obsessed with that game for a little while, for like a week.
3474538	3475278	And I played it too.
3476299	3479220	It was a very, very cute and very interesting game.
3479300	3484443	My old roommate from Arizona came up here, what, two weekends ago, I believe.
3485083	3488965	And this is one of the games that he owned, and I had never even heard of it before.
3489825	3493267	And it's, to me, you know, I don't know how...
3493894	3495255	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3523140	3529143	and it made this little p-p-p-p noise and it was like really, really funny in a five-year-old kind of way.
3529403	3534105	But I never actually played with it, so I used the more mission-targeted ones.
3534405	3535665	Check it out, it's hilarious.
3535726	3540908	And yes, it was a Konami game, and they also did, you know, obviously DDR and Dewey's Adventure and all this other stuff.
3540928	3541488	What?
3541868	3542669	You don't say.
3543129	3550292	Well, they came out around the same time as Wing Island as well, and they were both kind of very under-the-radar and kind of average games,
3550902	3557267	I thought it was kind of neat though because you could play two players on one controller if you had one person use the nunchuck and the other person use the remote.
3558228	3558448	Huh.
3560029	3561130	So, I don't know.
3561710	3566834	Well then, three cheers for Kurarimpa from our studly Jason.
3566874	3567875	What else have you been playing lately?
3569109	3573672	I have been playing Super Paper Mario, which is immensely better than Paper Mario.
3573732	3577514	I never played Thousand Year Door, but Super Paper Mario is actually pretty addicting.
3578074	3581736	You sound pretty in love with your Wii right now.
3581856	3587439	If it's not 360, which in this week it hasn't been so much, I go between the two.
3588799	3592722	I was marching through Resident Evil 4, which I still haven't beaten.
3594062	3594823	Oh, Resident Evil...
3596637	3602161	Much like I revealed the I don't play Zeldas very often and everybody called me a blasphemer, I know, I'm sorry.
3603523	3609527	I've played Resident Evil 2 a couple times, but all of these kind of stopped not too terribly far into it.
3610128	3616452	Code Veronica was the one game that I got, I think, about halfway through with, but I just kind of stopped playing it.
3616933	3619575	Resident Evil 4, with the Wii controls...
3620222	3621242	Big exception.
3621622	3625404	That made that game so unbelievably fun.
3625544	3630185	You know, I haven't played Resident Evil 4 on the Wii yet, but honestly, I thought it was great on the GameCube.
3630225	3632506	So, like, the Wii would just add even more to it.
3632586	3634446	Widescreen and motion controls sounds hot.
3634706	3641648	Widescreen, free aim pointing, that's the best part of it, is that you have the full screen to aim with the remote.
3641989	3643309	Makes it the best, makes...
3644031	3646212	Oh, it's great.
3646312	3647452	It's so fun to control.
3647472	3648153	It's so fun to play.
3648253	3648693	Sounds hot.
3648973	3651954	All right, Jason, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but any other thoughts from our listeners?
3653455	3657997	I own Metroid Prime Corruption, and I haven't even opened it and played it yet.
3658237	3659717	Oh, my God, that game is great.
3659757	3660638	You need to do that now.
3661238	3664559	I know, but I have so many things I want to play.
3664980	3667601	Tonight, Jason, tonight, you are to open that game tonight and play.
3670082	3670862	You must.
3671142	3671782	Don't tell me no.
3672202	3673063	You know you can't tell me no.
3673103	3673463	I'm cute.
3675698	3676218	This is true.
3676498	3676779	All right.
3677839	3679919	All right, Jason, and say hi to Rye for us.
3680619	3680939	Will do.
3681100	3681600	All right, bye-bye.
3682240	3682480	Bye.
3682980	3693822	Our lovely webmaster, Jason, VXJason, X, awesome, X, V, sex, V, Jason, calling in.
3693842	3696103	1-877-GAME-OLR, or we could just take this call.
3696143	3697203	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3697223	3697583	Who's this?
3698383	3699304	Yo, what's up?
3699384	3700024	It's Ranma.
3700204	3701444	Ranny, what's up?
3704346	3718609	Remember a few weeks ago you talked about the movie Press Start?
3720169	3726170	Yes, wasn't that that one that looked like this horrible, not even a B-movie, but a C-movie production?
3726530	3731071	But not that that's necessarily a bad thing, done by total hardcore nerds.
3733035	3734476	It was fucking awesome!
3734516	3735357	Did you see it?
3735417	3735978	Was it great?
3736758	3738980	My roommate ordered it and we watched it last night.
3739400	3741502	Oh my god, it was great!
3742743	3746346	Now, without ruining it too much, tell us something that was really funny about it.
3747767	3752752	It's just the homages and the parodies and the respects they gave to old school gaming.
3753232	3760258	The plot was very Final Fantasy-ish, the opening was Paperboy, and well, it went on from there.
3761252	3762133	Nudity Nearly Naked Chick
3783815	3784956	Okay, well, that's right.
3784996	3785976	That's close to nudity.
3785996	3786896	That's partial nudity.
3787256	3787517	All right.
3788517	3789037	Good times.
3789517	3790818	So, cool.
3790838	3794059	Then we'll have to put that on our Christmas list to check out that movie.
3794159	3795340	Anything that you've been playing this week?
3796340	3796720	Let's see.
3796740	3801382	I've been playing Phantom Hourglass, and thanks to Jamie, I've been playing R.O.
3801402	3804163	Oh, dear.
3804964	3805404	Watch out.
3805444	3806484	The cancer is spreading.
3809065	3809826	It's not bad.
3809866	3812407	Plus, I fired up Age of Mythology.
3812447	3813247	I've been playing that again.
3814309	3816652	Rob, how come you're not on American Idol?
3830939	3833242	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3848908	3849268	Horrible.
3849568	3852730	But I do, I mean, even though that's the end of it, I can do without.
3853091	3861236	I think it's extremely flattering that people actually took the time to create something related to Orange Lounge Radio and some of our in-jokes.
3861396	3862737	It's incredibly flattering.
3862797	3864097	So thank you to everybody who was involved.
3864117	3867900	Because I knew, like, probably like six different people contributed, stepfiles, backgrounds.
3867940	3869781	I mean, it was a group project.
3870181	3871022	So well done to all.
3872242	3872843	Definitely.
3873183	3876285	And after playing it, I suggested to DT we need to do something new.
3877421	3877641	All right.
3877681	3883288	Well, then you'll have to get hard at work on OL Revolution Second Mix Plus.
3883668	3884149	Oh, no.
3884269	3884989	Not dancing.
3885630	3886091	Not dancing.
3886451	3886551	Oh.
3887072	3887692	Oh, a new game.
3887712	3888453	All right.
3888553	3892478	I suggested Orange Lounge the Revolution, the fighting game.
3892618	3893279	Well, wait.
3893359	3894580	What about – A new game, right?
3895081	3895501	Yes.
3895581	3898825	There was OLR versus AGI, wasn't there, at some point?
3899838	3904261	Well, before we get to that, we've got to have the first game, which would have to be Orange Lounge to Fighter.
3904461	3904841	I see.
3905141	3907562	Then AGI to Fighter, then the Versus match.
3907722	3908403	I see, I see.
3908463	3910524	So we will build to the Versus game.
3910564	3910964	That's good.
3911364	3911644	All right.
3911924	3913125	Well, you guys get to work on that.
3913465	3916387	Any last thoughts for the Callers, Ranma, before we let you go?
3916527	3921829	I think we'd start this after the holidays, you know, when everybody's like, oh, let's make a Fighter.
3921930	3923030	That's fine.
3923270	3926692	That's when I'm going to finally get around to redoing the website into something viewable.
3928055	3928976	We'll be around the holidays.
3929096	3929376	All right.
3929996	3930777	Take care, Ranma.
3931577	3932097	Love you guys.
3932137	3932317	Later.
3932838	3933058	Bye.
3934519	3939481	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3939562	3940822	All one word smooshed together.
3940882	3942263	No spaces, no dashes, nothing.
3943784	3944084	All right.
3946021	3949385	TheRobD says, good luck with the AG side, I'm one of the few fighting fans.
3949685	3962679	And I guess AGI's been on a bit of like, kind of like a little bit of a hiatus in the past few weeks, and I think that's because Scott's been going on the road, doing like a reality show type thing with these guys who are like a Counter-Strike team, I think it was.
3962759	3965902	I watched the pilot that he had posted, and it wasn't bad.
3966162	3967724	Is it because his writers went on strike?
3968337	3968938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3996923	3997446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4005108	4010193	I saw that bus, I'm like, oh my god, there's a Counter-Strike bus at that fucking next level place.
4010233	4018440	Now we have a reason to have the OLR fighting game, because someone needs to punch Scott in the face for not calling us when... Well, obviously it was in Loki's backyard.
4019060	4022923	I was there, I went to see a movie, I'm like, god, there's a Counter-Strike bus here?
4023504	4027107	I'm like, why would they... Well, because it went to this land center next level or something.
4027667	4028428	Haven't we all been there?
4028568	4030770	I have a customer that hates...
4031548	4036611	They're competing LAN centers or whatever, and they absolutely hate them, and they talk crap about them all day long.
4037031	4039792	But, you know, so I saw them, like, why is there anyone here?
4039852	4041373	I mean, seriously, it's Eldorado Hills.
4041453	4044555	I mean, like, does anyone actually play LAN games here?
4044575	4046316	All right, well, there you have it.
4046696	4054300	All right, well, we're going to go back to the phones, and we'll take another call, and then we're going to get into some last-minute stories.
4054480	4055381	Be someone awesome.
4056121	4057302	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4057322	4057702	Who's this?
4058482	4059002	What's up?
4060276	4061717	Hi Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
4061737	4062918	I said awesome!
4063198	4063639	No, I'm kidding.
4063899	4070424	Um, not much, just chilling on this weekend, coming, basically just coming back from the tournament and whatnot.
4070864	4072245	What tournament was it this time?
4073306	4074447	It was one out in Jersey.
4074907	4080571	You heard of this arcade called Fun and Games, which is closing down for five months to relocate nearby.
4081172	4084054	So they were just having a whole thing, shitloads of tournaments yesterday.
4084434	4088197	No, the only arcade I've been to in Jersey is that eight on the break, which is pretty well known, I guess.
4088877	4089058	Yeah.
4089238	4089498	Yeah.
4090345	4101409	But besides that, I'm just, you know, just gloating over the fact that, you know, a game like Mario Galaxy can, you know, can be as evocative.
4101489	4104250	Now, last week you were so freaking excited.
4104310	4106530	Like, you had so much energy last week when you called in.
4106670	4110852	The thing is that it's like Mario, it basically plays like Mario 64.
4110892	4114693	The whole thing plays like it, but with, you know, most controlled games.
4115327	4120369	It plays, it's motion, you know, it's basically Mario 64 motion controls and spikier graphics.
4121350	4135196	And, you know, I mean, when you play Mario 64, I mean, you get that feeling of just, you know, that new, innovative, that new innovative, you know, gameplay where you just, you know, die instantly and you have life.
4136117	4139018	Whereas this one, I don't know, I guess it kind of...
4140612	4141473	Here's what it boils down to.
4141553	4144176	Here's what it boils down to, Zaku, is that did you have fun?
4144436	4146499	Because if you have fun playing it, then it's good.
4146539	4146960	Yeah, I know.
4149807	4155169	I just gotta give it a little bit more time since I only played it in the Nintendo World launch last week.
4155449	4158210	Then again, I haven't picked up the full game myself yet.
4158270	4162251	I tried to go to Toys R Us this week to pick up the game because they're doing that whole $25 gift card thing.
4162611	4164792	And once you know it, they didn't get the game the day it came out.
4164812	4165892	There was some shipping delay.
4165952	4166272	I don't know.
4166332	4170373	Probably some frickin' truck full of Super Mario Galaxies tipped over on the freeway or some shit.
4170833	4171454	So I didn't buy it.
4171494	4175435	But we did that preview last week and I was lucky enough to get to play it for the 40 minutes.
4175455	4176315	It was fun.
4176395	4176715	I enjoyed it.
4176735	4178976	I would get a week for, you know, I would just
4179403	4185266	I would seriously get a Wii if there was, you know, more in terms of a little bit more hardcore games.
4185306	4189689	I know they're trying to stick to the, you know, trying to stay on the course of the whole casual thing.
4190629	4193731	I mean, I already know Metroid and, you know, whatnot.
4194331	4198333	But stuff like, I don't know, just gotta make good use of the motion controls.
4199414	4203216	You know, and especially the online stuff, that's pretty much lacking.
4203536	4205957	If they want to compete, you know, against Microsoft and Sony.
4206097	4207278	But Brawl's gonna be sexy.
4208030	4209971	I know, I hear.
4209991	4213053	That's going to be the new game for anime conventions.
4213594	4214254	Oh, Lordy.
4214935	4220518	Yes, you're going to see a whole bunch of those Otaku folks just duking it out with the motion controls and whatnot.
4221219	4223780	That's going to be the new tournament game in February.
4224201	4227023	All right, Zaku, any other thoughts for our listeners before we take some more calls?
4228784	4234007	Just got to love the hypocrisy of people banning Mass Effect one day and unbanning it the other.
4234608	4235548	Talking to you, C4.
4236129	4236549	All right.
4237270	4238011	Rock on, Zaku!
4257062	4259523	Mass Effect was... Oh, it's too much talking, though, right?
4259823	4261543	It's seriously 25 minutes to get into some action.
4261563	4263843	So it's like listening to the Skype segment of this program, right?
4263863	4265204	It's not necessarily like that.
4265264	4267204	It's just, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4267224	4268905	We got to set up the story, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4269565	4274626	It's funny, though, because, like, you pick your backstory and stuff, and it's just, it's really... But there's lesbian sex.
4276086	4280547	And the way... You get the name of your character, but they all call you by your last name because you can't change that.
4280567	4281967	All right, we're getting another call, sir.
4282027	4282648	We got to get to it.
4282708	4283988	All right, hi, you're on Orange Lost Radio.
4284008	4284348	Who's this?
4285049	4286270	This is Brad from PodCulture.
4302722	4303122	Yes?
4303623	4308047	Picked that up yesterday, and let me tell you, it's the most fun I've had in the game in a long time.
4308468	4309769	And that's what a lot of the reviews are saying.
4309789	4310690	Did you hear this week?
4310790	4316896	Mario Galaxy is now the official number one rated game ever on that...
4317725	4320426	I don't know if it's Metacritic or one of those other game rankings.
4320446	4320846	That's what it is.
4320866	4325028	GameRankings.com has surpassed Ocarina of Time as the number one game.
4325068	4328829	Now granted, one negative review will fuck that all up at this point.
4329210	4331270	But right now it is the number one game of all time.
4331290	4335232	Which actually kind of surprised me because I thought generally Bioshock was getting better reviews this year.
4335632	4336413	But go fig.
4337533	4338213	People love their Nintendo.
4338233	4339274	I haven't played Bioshock yet.
4339514	4340674	I can't judge on that.
4340714	4345016	But it's the first Wii game I've seen where the controls haven't felt tacked on.
4346135	4346715	Uh-huh.
4347216	4353759	Because this was the game, and I think a lot of people have kind of described it this way, this was the game that the Wii was kind of made for.
4354459	4362003	Like, this was Miyamoto's big idea, like, here's how I want to do the next Mario game, and they're like, okay, Miyamoto, you're so fucking awesome, we'll build a console around it.
4363884	4369707	It is, it's really cool, because it just feels natural in playing it, and it still, it was...
4371619	4372980	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4398298	4404001	When you're in one of the hidden levels and you have to pick up the notes, it plays the little Super Mario Bros.
4404021	4404301	scene.
4404681	4405381	Oh, that's right.
4405401	4405962	I remember that.
4406002	4406462	That was cool.
4406482	4408183	We saw that in one of the levels we played.
4408323	4408983	Good times.
4410383	4412424	Anything else you've been playing lately besides Mario Galaxy?
4413045	4417967	Nah, too busy getting stuff ready for my girlfriend's trip to the hospital.
4418607	4419247	Oh, no.
4419347	4419868	Sorry to hear that.
4419888	4420908	I hope everything's okay.
4421568	4422189	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4422229	4422529	Just...
4423820	4424500	We'll have her in our thoughts.
4424520	4425321	And some plumbing removed.
4426121	4426541	Oh, okay.
4426601	4429042	Well, we'll have her in our thoughts and hope everything is well.
4429503	4432404	And you'll have to bring her a DS or some games to cheer her up.
4432764	4433624	Or maybe some Doctor Who DVDs.
4433644	4434605	We picked up Harvest Moon for her.
4434985	4435345	What's that?
4435945	4438166	Picked up Harvest Moon for her Game Boy Advance.
4438206	4438687	There you go.
4438727	4443989	That will keep a person occupied for a long-ass time to finally get anything accomplished in that game.
4444169	4444649	It'll be great.
4447070	4450792	I just got a call in and say that Super Mario is probably the...
4451952	4455075	Most fun in a long time on the game You think it's going to be game of the year?
4458238	4470389	I think it's got a broader appeal than some of the other games that have been rating real high Like Battleshock won't appeal to everybody Or Halo 3 won't appeal to everybody But Mario Galaxy has more of a wider appeal, I think
4470979	4472140	That's a dang good point.
4472240	4472641	You're right.
4472721	4483470	A lot of the games that are kind of leading the race for Game of the Year right now may not have that same family-friendly, quote-unquote, appeal that Mario Galaxy has and that is so important during the Christmastime rush.
4483731	4484271	Very good point.
4485412	4487494	Well, Brad, thank you so much for calling in as always.
4487534	4491378	We'd love to hear from you and hope everything is okay for you this holiday season.
4491418	4491698	All righty?
4492378	4492979	All righty, guys.
4493279	4493520	All right.
4493560	4494000	Take care, buddy.
4494460	4494801	Later on.
4494981	4495341	Bye-bye.
4496522	4497283	Very good point there.
4497856	4502120	Super Mario Galaxy may not be the game of the year for the hardcore gamer, but certainly a broad game.
4502500	4508305	Of course, we will be doing a grand Christmas show this year, just like we did last year, or I should say end of the year show.
4508966	4510748	More details on that throughout the month of December.
4511688	4512409	We have more calls.
4512469	4513410	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4513430	4513770	Who's this?
4514651	4515252	Hey, what's up, guys?
4515312	4515872	It's Robby.
4515892	4516553	It's been a while.
4516793	4517794	Wow, it has been a while.
4517834	4518455	How are you, Rob?
4519556	4520016	Not too bad.
4520056	4521657	I've mostly been working on Sunday's closing, so...
4523024	4525405	I work at a bookstore, so, you know, retail gets no time off.
4525525	4527326	Gotcha, yeah, especially in the next few months.
4527346	4529646	So I haven't been able to listen live in a while, so it's nice to hear you guys.
4530087	4535488	Yes, it's nice to have you on the program, and congratulations, you guys have got an icon as well on the Marketplace this week, I understand.
4536269	4536889	That is true.
4537049	4538209	Now we actually need to put out a show.
4538990	4540970	Yes, and your icon is very nice looking, too.
4541050	4541811	I was very impressed.
4542831	4543951	Funny story about that, actually.
4543991	4550794	We thought about just toning down our original iTunes artwork, but we figured that wouldn't be good enough for Xbox Live.
4551014	4551194	Right.
4551622	4566294	Um, I, uh, I went to one of the all-games chatters, DC Nate, uh, awesome guy, uh, and we talked a little bit about, came up with an idea for the clock and everything, and, uh, prepared all of that in, I think, four hours, because that was how much time we had left before, uh, the deadline came through.
4566314	4573120	Yeah, we had to get that stuff in fast, I remember that, because, like, it was... Yeah, because Black, Bobby was, uh, Bobby was very firm about the deadlines, and, uh,
4574200	4577901	He gave us warning and gave us some time, but it was a very hurried process.
4577961	4578181	Yes.
4578681	4585383	I'm actually going to show the chat some of the rejects for the icon, because we actually had a couple icons that were almost there, but they were rejected.
4585723	4587204	I'm going to actually paste some of those in chat.
4587524	4589024	I'm going to do the one I did.
4589044	4592325	The one I did has the three faces, and I don't know how...
4593311	4594051	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4623254	4624575	What were you saying?
4624795	4626656	What did you call in to talk about before we derailed the call?
4627417	4641045	Well, my first question, well, actually my only question to you guys is, now that most of the games have come out for this holiday season, with the exception of Mass Effect, which I actually, that's still due to be released before the holidays, before Christmas, right?
4641425	4643326	Hasn't been delayed, there isn't anything new that I haven't heard about.
4643346	4644147	No, it comes out in a couple days.
4644347	4645208	Yep, almost here.
4645928	4646328	Okay, cool.
4647329	4652332	Where would you rank this holiday season compared to other big ones in video game history as far as quality of games go?
4653155	4663759	I'd say it's pretty far up there, but I think 1998 with Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid was probably better, and 2001 with Halo, Melee, and what was the other big one?
4663819	4665120	GTA 3 was probably better.
4665620	4676524	A big complaint about this year's games is that to me there's a lack of games that can be truly considered timeless, like a Metal Gear Solid where people will be coming back to it years later and playing it.
4677124	4678805	Maybe Galaxy falls into that mold, but
4679386	4680827	Bioshock is a first-person shooter.
4681347	4684668	First-person shooters get tossed to the wayside like yesterday's dinner.
4684868	4687689	Especially with no multiplayer to keep people coming back.
4690410	4698233	You know, I gotta say, here's the thing about this year's batch of games that I think does make it better than years past, and that is the fact that there's no new consoles this year.
4698333	4700254	There's nothing in the realm of new consoles.
4700494	4704035	There's console redesigns, kind of, but there's no new consoles.
4704075	4707116	It's really the first year we don't even have a new handheld system.
4707336	4708377	It's wide open.
4709157	4710018	as to what's out there.
4710338	4714801	And I think, therefore, the consoles that are out in the marketplace have had a little more time to mature.
4715401	4723646	Unfortunately, I don't feel PlayStation 3 has used the time to its best of ability, which kind of makes me think, honestly, PlayStation 3 should have just come out this year.
4724547	4724827	Probably.
4725387	4726248	But who am I?
4726648	4729469	I can see why maybe they didn't do it, because they want to be out there or whatever.
4730070	4730230	But
4730754	4741896	All that aside, you kind of see that now, okay, it's not so much the launch games, where you're getting into the second generation of games, and you could say even with 360, perhaps even starting to get into the third generation of games for the system.
4742256	4744617	I think next year's going to be even better, honestly.
4745057	4751478	And then probably the year after that is when you're going to start seeing stuff about the Xbox 720 or their next project, so you'll kind of start to die down.
4751818	4758239	But I do think kind of like next year will be even better than this year for that reason, that the consoles will have had a little time to age.
4758749	4760309	and I think that's the thing about, I think you cited 98.
4760450	4764491	I think that was the time when like, you know, 64 had already been out.
4765391	4767032	PlayStation had already been out a couple years.
4767152	4772533	I think those, you know, systems kind of had their time to really get, you know, some of their best stuff.
4773694	4775454	Like a fine wine, Jason says in chat.
4776034	4776495	There you go.
4777975	4778955	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
4779516	4786098	I mean, it'll be interesting to see how the PS3 brings it next year because Metal Gear Solid 4, hopefully, will be out by next holidays.
4786858	4787158	And, uh,
4787990	4789933	360 really brought it to the table this year.
4790613	4793958	PlayStation 3 brought a few things with Heavenly Sword and...
4795401	4796802	Well, a couple of the other ports that came over from the 360.
4797702	4800604	And hopefully next year they can just really keep it moving.
4800684	4805167	Hopefully the developers don't jump ship because home looks really exciting.
4805427	4807989	I think Final Fantasy XIII is going to have people drooling.
4808649	4811071	I think there's a lot to look forward to from PlayStation 3.
4811531	4813953	But again, it's been a very slow start.
4814013	4814613	But who knows?
4814873	4815654	That's a real question.
4815694	4818716	Can developers get used to the PS3 and use it to its full potential, which...
4819256	4821757	Most people seem to agree that it does have a lot of potential.
4821797	4826379	It's just really hard to develop for with the 8 trillion cores it has on there.
4827199	4827559	Interesting.
4828160	4834962	I'm getting a message from DMM that says, 21 Xbox Live users have the OLR pick, according to whatever he found.
4836343	4836943	That's amazing.
4837904	4841245	I would be thrilled if two people were using it, honestly, myself and Loki.
4841885	4843486	Yeah, Bobby is winning by...
4843971	4844391	Wow, Bobby.
4844411	4844611	Wow, Bobby.
4844631	4845132	Wow, that's pretty cool.
4868462	4868842	Bobby has 381.
4869203	4870884	Evil Avatar has 487.
4871245	4875248	Now, see, Evil Avatar has a huge community behind them, so I believe that.
4876249	4877230	Yeah, you guys have 22.
4878531	4878912	Rock!
4879612	4883116	Bobby has, what, like 15 times the number of people using his picture than we do?
4883676	4885077	AGI has 47.
4885157	4887460	Actually, no, they have 43.
4887740	4887920	I have 8.
4888260	4888581	Woo-hoo!
4888741	4889081	Woo-hoo!
4889782	4890102	Nice.
4890502	4891303	Go meet in the Matrix.
4891423	4892024	Well, we need to...
4892597	4893898	We need to get the shows back.
4894058	4894858	Damn it.
4894878	4895478	We need people.
4895538	4897179	Okay, people using Bobby pictures.
4897219	4897839	He doesn't need it.
4898159	4901680	You need to switch over to the OLR pic or a T-Dig pic.
4901740	4902901	Bobby don't need the numbers no more.
4904101	4904742	I'm just kidding.
4905062	4905662	I think it's great.
4905682	4906522	He's getting a lot of support.
4906602	4907182	Kudos to him.
4907323	4907783	Exactly.
4907843	4909283	I think it's great people are using him at all.
4910424	4910924	Absolutely.
4911364	4914865	All right, well, Rob D., we've given you way more time than the other callers.
4914885	4917186	I've got to let you go, but any quick final thoughts for our listeners?
4918627	4918987	Game on.
4919007	4921988	We'll try to get T-Dig back, but unfortunately I can't make promises since I
4923508	4927589	I'm going to work practically full-time in school, half-time, but you guys know the excuses.
4927629	4929229	You guys have been through that before, I'm sure.
4929489	4930069	Absolutely.
4930089	4930390	See you later.
4930670	4930970	Absolutely.
4930990	4931810	All right, take care, Rob.
4932850	4933430	Good luck to you.
4933950	4937031	T-Dig was a good show, and he had a whole other guy that edited it, too.
4938491	4939811	Lots of work that went into that show.
4939891	4941512	All right, maybe one more call.
4941532	4945193	We've got time for one more call, then we'll jump into the afterbirth in our Rock Band post-show.
4946473	4949233	Actually, I don't see the line ringing, but let's do some quick last-minute stories.
4949653	4950974	Jamie, you have anything for last-minute stories?
4951574	4952314	I'm out of Mountain Dew.
4953849	4955050	Almost.
4955170	4956211	I see a little more Mountain Dew in there.
4956231	4956831	I have a little left.
4957111	4958672	Well, all right, Loki.
4959513	4963896	I was going to say Avatar, The Last Airbender, The Burning Earth.
4964256	4972301	You can get all 1,000 achievement points in two minutes in that game by just backing up into a corner and hitting a button over and over and over again.
4972502	4972962	Amazing.
4973002	4973742	We got another call.
4973762	4974703	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
4974723	4975083	Who's this?
4976564	4977425	This is DMN.
4977585	4978586	Hello, DMN.
4978606	4979126	What's on your mind?
4981082	4982904	I have a challenge for the three of you.
4983344	4983985	Oh, shit.
4984745	4985005	No!
4985586	4987427	This isn't anything stupid.
4987668	4988148	I promise.
4989549	4990750	I don't know about that.
4991030	4997776	I challenge the three of you to convince myself and everyone listening that Dance Dance Revolution is not dead.
4998136	4998336	Go.
4999717	5000178	Is what?
5000518	5002119	Dance Dance Revolution is not dead.
5004241	5006763	I saw people playing it the other day at the pizza place.
5008324	5008805	Here it is.
5009363	5011684	I'll agree with you because I picked up Supernova 2
5035737	5039978	and it's arguably the worst musically Dance Dance Revolution game I've ever played in my life.
5040238	5044559	Interesting because not a lot of people necessarily felt the same way.
5045640	5053001	I don't think necessarily it was received that poorly by the community but I don't think people make such a big deal out of these releases anymore.
5053021	5056542	I think Universe 2 is coming out soon and it's kind of being met with this big hmm.
5057543	5058143	And this is it.
5058183	5058383	It's
5059815	5061577	DDR is back and it's alive again!
5084196	5094584	And the reason why I always praised the Ultramix series on this show previously is that like three quarters of the innovative shit you saw on the console games were all coming from the Xbox series.
5095045	5101270	Things like quest mode, things like song lists reaching out into independent music scene, you know, all that stuff.
5101370	5103832	That was all innovated by the Xbox team.
5104612	5105113	And that's why that...
5106551	5119820	Those types of innovations, at least even when they fail, because not everything is done very well, like the quest mode in Universe was god-awful, but I give them props for at least trying to innovate a dead game.
5120860	5125303	Well, and then the other thing too is that they keep making so many damn games for it.
5125363	5130686	I mean, seriously, if anybody's to blame for killing the series, it's Konami.
5130827	5131367	It's because...
5131834	5132314	Well, let's see.
5132454	5140896	This year alone, we had DDR Universe come out, DDR Supernova 2, DDR Hottest Party, and we're going to have DDR Universe 2 coming out.
5141416	5146598	And then next year already, I can think of at least two more games that are coming out in the DDR series.
5147318	5153259	One of which is the never-talked-about DDR Disney Mix, or DDR Disney Channel.
5153279	5155640	You know, it's crap like that.
5155780	5158380	It's watering this shit down, and it's not really innovative.
5158400	5160841	It's just, let's throw some more songs in there, and that's it.
5161397	5164318	But, you know, they still sell very well.
5164378	5165718	We always sell out of them.
5166078	5176001	And, you know, if you look in the past, you know, recent, well, I don't know about the recent charts, but I know that DDR Extreme 2 was on the top of charts for a long time, or at least Supernova was.
5176641	5178941	And Supernova 2's not doing bad at all.
5179521	5182062	I mean, probably their expectations are lower, but
5182908	5190897	I think a lot of it is Hottest Party Yay, use the remote nunchuck That was crap Universe 2
5192134	5194775	is going to be, you know, not much more innovative.
5194875	5195535	Oh, great.
5195736	5197196	They brought freestyle mode back.
5197236	5198917	It's a game where you don't have arrows.
5199417	5200658	Fucking awesome.
5200758	5201218	Here's the thing.
5201618	5205400	Okay, Konami, one of my favorite game companies ever.
5205760	5207120	I've known people that have worked there.
5207160	5209101	I have great relationships with a lot of the folks that work there.
5209601	5210802	Here's the thing.
5210842	5215624	My honest, like, friendly advice to the folks at Konami, take a page from Harmonix.
5216576	5243836	because look at what Harmonix did is that basically they were given the challenge of oh look Guitar Hero got taken away from you but we want to make we want to have you make kind of the same thing and they like took what essentially was kind of the same fucking game and just really ran away with it and with this rock band and kind of made something completely new out of it and this whole like you can print your band's t-shirt like this is all like crazy stuff like running away with innovative ideas I think honestly DDR
5244657	5247139	might want to hire a consultant from Harmonix.
5249101	5250362	I don't know, what do you think?
5251022	5256387	I will say, you're talking about Universe, I think Musical Universe is actually one of the best DDR mixes I've ever played.
5258008	5269758	It had a great variety of music, some things that were poppy that I could actually stand, because anybody who knows me, and I don't know if many people know me that personally, I do not like pop music at all.
5271079	5271179	Um...
5273169	5279954	Going from Slam to 8-Bit to Don't Play Nice, which is a song I actually enjoyed, was a lot of fun.
5282076	5282917	I agree.
5282977	5284178	Universe has an excellent song list.
5284678	5285679	And that's really what D.D.
5285699	5286319	Abrams went on to.
5286619	5291343	The standard list from Supernova 2, without unlocking anything, was just a disappointment.
5291643	5294125	There was one song I was like, huh, this is awesome.
5294566	5297848	Okay, wait, two, because I didn't know one song and there was my gold press.
5297868	5298549	That was a good song.
5299271	5301852	But Rockefeller's Gang was the only song I'm like, huh, this is a good song.
5301892	5303472	I mean, everything else didn't really stand out.
5305713	5307193	And it was a bit of a disappointment.
5308214	5311955	And again, I paid nothing for it, so I shouldn't complain too much.
5312735	5317996	I stand by that I firmly believe that the best home mix to come out in the U.S.
5318176	5324978	or Japan anywhere, anytime, and probably will always be the best DDR game that comes out on the home consoles is Ultramix 2 on the Xbox.
5325298	5327459	And the reason why is because that is where...
5327879	5329219	They took the most risk.
5329479	5335261	They completely changed the people that did the steps to people that really knew the game of DDR inside and out.
5335561	5339242	It's where they took some big risks with the song list that paid off in a huge way.
5339662	5352725	It's where they added these new modes that changed the game and had that Xbox Live dancing that was kind of explored in the first Ultramix game but totally improved on with the different types of versus modes in the second game.
5353665	5356626	I don't think there will ever be a DDR game as good as Ultramix 2, period.
5357631	5361892	that makes me feel as excited about DDR as I did when I first played Ultramix 2.
5362912	5365033	Anyway, we've got to let you go.
5365353	5367513	Our time's about up, but thanks for the call, DMN.
5368014	5368354	Okay.
5368894	5369794	Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
5369834	5371574	Were we able to meet your challenge somehow?
5373195	5378396	No, it was a good discussion, and I actually wanted to call in and not be a bumbling idiot for once.
5379036	5379956	We appreciate that.
5381117	5382857	We like it when you're not a bumbling idiot.
5382877	5386238	If they want to hear you being a bumbling idiot, they should just download OL Revolution.
5388861	5393043	They listen to Jamie saying your name over and over in a song.
5393063	5394203	There's nothing wrong with that.
5396324	5399244	But you and Drunk Drunk Revolution, seriously, WTF.
5400225	5402085	OMG, WTF, BBQ, LOL.
5402485	5403206	Alright, bye DMN.
5404946	5406827	Alright, that's it for the Skype line today.
5406847	5407827	We gotta close it up.
5408926	5410187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5431550	5432030	and DarkSakura.com.
5454445	5457948	Actually, this is for anyone who is waiting for Unreal Tournament 3 on Xbox 360.
5457988	5462791	They actually said that it works already and has worked since last spring.
5463871	5469155	And that they've actually put on hold any further development on it because of getting it to work on Xbox Live.
5469775	5472637	But what about that whole, like, it's supposed to be out on PlayStation 3 first for like a week though, right?
5472657	5474859	It is going to be out on Windows and PlayStation 3 first.
5475259	5481663	Then they're taking Christmas off and are going to start working on the Xbox 360 version so that they can get it to work with mods and everything.
5482732	5488597	So that's where the delay is, but it works, and it has been working, and it could be done by now, but no.
5489037	5489738	But there's that deal.
5489998	5493781	But there's the deal, and there's also the fact that they're trying to get it to work on live.
5494862	5495322	Alright, Loki.
5495803	5507732	Anyways, Microsoft is doing an offer, which is less cool now because originally we thought it was for everybody, but apparently if you own an original Xbox and you have a paid Xbox Live account...
5508371	5516633	And if you purchase an Xbox 360 between November 21st and December 21st of this year, you'll be entitled to a free copy of Halo 3.
5517813	5522395	So you fill out some sort of form and you get a copy mailed to you.
5523135	5523915	Hooray!
5525455	5525895	Postal 3.
5526616	5529076	Apparently Uebol is in the game and you can kill him.
5530277	5530697	In the game.
5531577	5531797	Awesome.
5533619	5561820	and then the Wii Zapper apparently there is of course some pictures that floated on the internet with some unboxing of that and there is a second configuration which also begs the question why the fuck do you actually need this then where you take the nunchuck basically out of the Wii Zapper and you just hold the Zapper with the remote in there like you would hold the remote normally so it's a piece of plastic that's completely useless
5562657	5563217	Hooray!
5564858	5565859	But we will soon see.
5566660	5568221	Can I use the Wii Zapper on a Wii Bowl?
5570122	5572543	Maybe if they put out Postal 3 on the Wii.
5572924	5574405	Have you played Manhunt 2 on the Wii yet?
5574905	5576206	No, I really don't care.
5576226	5578888	It's just the PSP, huh?
5578968	5581890	Yeah, I was all excited to get it originally when it was adult only.
5582570	5584792	And now I'm just like, eh, whatever.
5584932	5586393	It's just not as controversial anymore.
5586833	5587954	I'll play No More Heroes.
5587974	5588774	That'll be pretty cool.
5589034	5590956	But, you know, Manhunt 2, I don't care.
5591396	5591576	All right.
5592393	5593534	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5593574	5594034	I want pie.
5594054	5595595	Ooh, my final thought is I'm going to steal DarkSakura's iPhone.
5595635	5596055	No, no, it's mine.
5596075	5596636	But I also want pie.
5596656	5596736	Loki.
5596756	5599457	My final thought is I need to take some more extra strength Tylenol.
5599478	5601539	Yay, sorry to hear about your headache.
5620396	5621637	Well, that's it for this week.
5621977	5623879	DarkSakura, have a good two weeks off.
5623939	5624860	Have fun in Alabama.
5625180	5625560	I will.
5625640	5627762	Maybe I will call you on Sunday.
5627842	5628163	Sounds good.
5628463	5633447	I think originally we were going to take a week off, but I haven't heard that chatter, so I don't think we are going to do that.
5633467	5634868	I think we are going to be live the next two weeks.
5634928	5636810	So we'll be here doing our thang.
5637250	5639931	It could be possible I'll be here the week after, but I might just be dead.
5640231	5642752	Yeah, no, if you need the night off, go for it.
5642933	5649495	We'll find some of our local favorites to help fill in, and possibly the wheat zapper challenge happens.
5649656	5663622	But if any of our, I'm actually going to be hopefully meeting up with a friend of mine back there who I met again through DDR, who I met while I lived out here, and then, so I think it's kind of funny.
5664302	5664362	So.
5664973	5667476	Puppies already volunteering to fill in for a night when you're not here.
5667616	5668197	Okay, puppy.
5669138	5670119	And send me some chocolate.
5670580	5672522	Will you allow puppy to sit in the fluffy blue chair?
5672542	5674964	Puppy can sit in the fluffy blue chair.
5675065	5675345	All right.
5675765	5679489	It used to be the big green chair, the big green monster chair, but now it's the fluffy blue chair.
5680190	5681031	It's lightweight and fluffy.
5681472	5681692	Anyways.
5682967	5683788	That's it, folks.
5683948	5685849	We've got to play the outro and get on out of here.
