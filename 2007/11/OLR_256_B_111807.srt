00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:24,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, November the 18th of 2007.

3
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,793
[SPEAKER_13]: By the time most of you guys hear this on the podcast, it'll probably be Thanksgiving time.

4
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:34,558
[SPEAKER_13]: So to all of our fellow American listeners, happy Thanksgiving and hope you're having a good day today.

5
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:39,222
[SPEAKER_13]: To all of our non-American listeners, happy Thursday, whenever that happens to fall for you.

6
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:42,285
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's go back into the gaming news.

7
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:42,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

8
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:45,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Thursday from wherever that happens to fall.

9
00:00:45,523 --> 00:00:47,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm thinking in my mind Thanksgiving.

10
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:48,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind.

11
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:49,525
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm out of it tonight.

12
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:51,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Thursday lands on the same time of the week each week.

13
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, not when you have the international date line involved, okay?

14
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:57,669
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still the same time each week.

15
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:58,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Their time.

16
00:00:58,929 --> 00:00:59,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

17
00:00:59,289 --> 00:00:59,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate you.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:11,655
[SPEAKER_11]: So another reason I guess people are kind of bitter, you know, Club Nintendo, this wonderful little program that they have in Japan where they get a bunch of cool free shit that we don't ever see anywhere else around the world.

19
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:13,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Famicom Super Nintendo Super Famicom

20
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:42,116
[SPEAKER_11]: and two 2008 tabletop calendars.

21
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:49,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, if you want these, you have until December 2nd to select one of the above items.

22
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:58,762
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, according to IGN's translation of the site, those Famicom controllers are going to be delivered by April 2008.

23
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:01,903
[SPEAKER_11]: But still though, I think those are pretty cool.

24
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:05,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad we don't have anything like that over here.

25
00:02:06,705 --> 00:02:07,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, that's...

26
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:09,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Very cool.

27
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:10,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't they do that over here, you think?

28
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:12,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it just a money thing?

29
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Too many people would get in on it or what?

30
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't they just do it like a contest or something silly?

31
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they don't like us.

32
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:18,666
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

33
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:19,326
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't like us?

34
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:20,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

35
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:25,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, God, we buy their freaking Wii's even though they haven't put out that many games this year to support it.

36
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:27,050
[SPEAKER_13]: We've stood by them.

37
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,270
[SPEAKER_13]: We should get something out of it, don't you think?

38
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:30,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.

39
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:31,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess not.

40
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:32,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Jerks.

41
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:35,013
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

42
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:37,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'll just continue to play the virtual console games with the...

43
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:38,878
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

44
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:56,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what's interesting is that there do appear to be some other games coming on board with an upcoming peripheral, and that is the Wii Balance Board.

45
00:02:57,055 --> 00:02:59,296
[SPEAKER_13]: It's coming out, I believe, early next year with Wii Fitness.

46
00:03:00,076 --> 00:03:02,497
[SPEAKER_13]: A new game has been announced that will use the Wii Balance Board.

47
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:05,139
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Namco Bandai's Family Ski.

48
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:10,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Famitsu has recently revealed this game, and it will be compatible with the Wii Balance Board.

49
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:17,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Notice that's compatible, not required, but certainly it does look like you'll get to use, you know, Mii-like characters in the game.

50
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:18,264
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure your own Mii's...

51
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:19,725
[SPEAKER_13]: with skiing.

52
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:25,289
[SPEAKER_13]: The game is supposedly going to come out winter of this year or 2008 even in Japan.

53
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,973
[SPEAKER_13]: So kind of interesting the game may actually be out in Japan before the Wii Fit board actually is out.

54
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:31,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So kind of cool.

55
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:40,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like how we have DualShock 3 support for PlayStation 3 games over here even though the controllers don't come out until the spring.

56
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:40,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

57
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:42,568
[SPEAKER_13]: What is that?

58
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:49,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Odd1 in chat says, oh man, and by the way, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, we always love our chatters, the ever-present fourth host on our show.

59
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:54,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Odd1 says, oh man, the Wii balance board is going to be the best way to randomly tackle friends and loved ones ever.

60
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:57,059
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

61
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:58,720
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be kind of scary, I don't know.

62
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:07,647
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say that they're also going to have a game in Wii Fit that's going to be a skiing or snowboarding game that's going to use the balance board as well, so...

63
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:12,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So wait, are we just going to see a lot of knockoffs of those type of games, kind of like we've been seeing in Wii Sports?

64
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:17,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, suddenly there's all these golf games and, you know, tennis games.

65
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's just like when Wii Play came out, hey, we could do shooting gallery type games in this?

66
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's make a bunch of them.

67
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:24,765
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll suck.

68
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:26,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay.

69
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:31,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, there's nothing wrong with, you know, another skiing game using it, because it's going to be a full, you know...

70
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:34,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Fleshed Out version of Skeen.

71
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:41,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Namco Bandai is a pretty respected third-party publisher that's not known for doing a lot of these type of knock-off games.

72
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,471
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how certain third-party publishers are kind of known for being nothing but a bunch of knock-off games?

73
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:51,174
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not really Namco Bandai, unless they're knocking themselves off or ripping themselves off with Katamari.

74
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:52,635
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know what I mean.

75
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:56,497
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the game will be fine.

76
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:01,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is actually something else that I think a lot of people are looking forward to on Wii.

77
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:30,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Okami will be on Wii and it will excuse me that wasn't fun but basically for the folks at Capcom they had actually been asked if Okami was going to have a Wii release before the PS2 version even came out so they were already thinking about it and so they're going to bring it out

78
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:33,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And we like widescreen.

79
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:33,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

80
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially me since I have a TV.

81
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:34,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm.

82
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:05,524
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know those TVs are going to be more and more out there as this Christmas goes on.

83
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:10,447
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think, you know, because that should be a big seller this year now that HD TVs are getting more and more affordable.

84
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're going to see more and more houses have those.

85
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:19,732
[SPEAKER_13]: So it'll be kind of interesting to see the gaming scene kind of have to evolve to catch up with that and all the games supporting widescreen.

86
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:22,714
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking at you, Nintendo.

87
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:23,794
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

88
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And your 480p HD.

89
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:27,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

90
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:28,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

91
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:29,638
[SPEAKER_11]: No price drop.

92
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:29,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Boo.

93
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:58,553
[SPEAKER_11]: No price drop.

94
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:01,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you need a price drop yet unless your system is like sucking.

95
00:07:02,496 --> 00:07:05,018
[SPEAKER_11]: That's when you start dropping the price of your system.

96
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:08,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Drunami in chat says, Beatings will continue until morale improves.

97
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:10,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

98
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:13,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Skate or Die

99
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:46,685
[SPEAKER_11]: and I know over here we're getting Air Zonk on Monday or Super Air Zonk.

100
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:47,965
[SPEAKER_11]: How did you find that out?

101
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Because... You have ways?

102
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:57,969
[SPEAKER_11]: No, actually because they announced it on, I believe, the Turbo... There's something like TurboGrafx-16 site that lists a bunch of this crap.

103
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,231
[SPEAKER_11]: It was officially announced, so... I think we should get that and Skate or Die here.

104
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,111
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be an awesome week.

105
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Hudson, I'm sure, did it.

106
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,516
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think they'll give us for Christmas on a virtual console?

107
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:10,820
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they could give me Guardian Legend, but I somehow don't think that'll happen.

108
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

109
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Have they made a Shrek game on the Super Nintendo?

110
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,425
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't think so.

111
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:15,667
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I want?

112
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:16,207
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

113
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:17,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Kirby's Avalanche.

114
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:21,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Get Dr. Bean Machine or whatever.

115
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:24,944
[SPEAKER_04]: But it actually plays differently on the Super Nintendo.

116
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,804
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be pretty funny.

117
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:28,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a whore for P.O.P.O.

118
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:30,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, I want to say Kirby's Avalanche is out there.

119
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,825
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting it mixed up with a golf game.

120
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,666
[SPEAKER_13]: They should have, well, maybe kind of like 1080.

121
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:35,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember that?

122
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:36,926
[SPEAKER_11]: What about 720?

123
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:37,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck 720.

124
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,947
[SPEAKER_11]: 1080 was a snowboarding game.

125
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but 720 was a skateboarding game.

126
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:42,308
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your point?

127
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:45,844
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't a very good skateboarding game.

128
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:47,186
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an awesome skateboarding game.

129
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:47,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

130
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:48,928
[SPEAKER_13]: You got killed by bees.

131
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

132
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,252
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

133
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:52,573
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes it all better.

134
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:53,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it does.

135
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,257
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got bees in it now.

136
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:58,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Actdeft says Kirby's Ambulance is already on the virtual console.

137
00:08:58,802 --> 00:08:59,283
[SPEAKER_13]: You missed it.

138
00:08:59,303 --> 00:08:59,663
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see it.

139
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:00,645
[SPEAKER_13]: You were sleeping that day.

140
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:04,425
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I get for not playing my Wii for, you know, two weeks.

141
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:06,646
[SPEAKER_13]: So Actdeft says both those games are out.

142
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:08,447
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

143
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:15,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really look at a lot of them so much because I actually have Kirby's Avalanche and a Super Nintendo, but I still kind of want to play it on my Wii.

144
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there you have it.

145
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Christmas comes early for you this year.

146
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:18,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

147
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:21,152
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I want Guardian Legend.

148
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:25,173
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're doing Sega games, then I freaking want Fantasy Zone.

149
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:28,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that would be kind of cool.

150
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:29,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Zone.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,963
[SPEAKER_04]: because the Genesis, all you needed was the power base converter to play Master System games on it so you could do it.

152
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,604
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what game they'll probably give us for Christmas?

153
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Huge selling Nintendo game that Nintendo made.

154
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:52,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Big court battle over the rights to the game because somebody else put an off color version of it out first and then Nintendo put a subpar version out themselves.

155
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:54,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet you you'll see Tetris on Christmas.

156
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:55,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet you anything.

157
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,875
[SPEAKER_04]: They should do the Tengen collection.

158
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:05,954
[SPEAKER_13]: I somehow doubt that Color Dreams games showing up on my Wii I would set fire to my Wii Those games were ass

159
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,596
[SPEAKER_13]: But Tengen Tetris was so much better.

160
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,436
[SPEAKER_13]: That game was cool.

161
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:10,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give you that.

162
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:12,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Tengen, I didn't mind them so much.

163
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:14,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Those were just basically Atari games like Klax.

164
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Those games were cool.

165
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,942
[SPEAKER_13]: But the Color Dreams games were also like non-licensed games.

166
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:21,303
[SPEAKER_13]: They were ass.

167
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Those games were horrible.

168
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:25,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You know actually what game I wouldn't mind?

169
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:27,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shoot.

170
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:30,769
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on Super Nintendo but I used to play it in the arcade all the time.

171
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:31,710
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a caveman game.

172
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Trog.

173
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:34,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

174
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:34,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember that one?

175
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:35,472
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

176
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:35,532
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

177
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:37,398
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not.

178
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well moving on with other virtual console news.

179
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,341
[SPEAKER_04]: One game in the UK.

180
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:43,802
[SPEAKER_04]: One game.

181
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:45,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Double Dribble.

182
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,484
[SPEAKER_13]: At least it's one fucking good game.

183
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:47,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

184
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:50,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Double Dribble is pretty good.

185
00:10:50,826 --> 00:10:54,789
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I don't play a lot of sports games, but I did play a shitload of Double Dribble.

186
00:10:55,229 --> 00:10:58,971
[SPEAKER_13]: And NBA Jam was like the all-time greatest basketball game is NBA Jam.

187
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:02,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever play any of the arcade NBA Jams that had the Mortal Kombat hacks?

188
00:11:02,514 --> 00:11:02,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

189
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:02,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

190
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:04,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course.

191
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:06,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Scorpion is an unlocked character, absolutely.

192
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can play, like, as, you know, the president.

193
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, how did a double dribble story turn into one?

194
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you said NBA Jam.

195
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:14,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know.

196
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:15,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fault, Rob.

197
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, tangent.

198
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:17,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

199
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

200
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:26,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if you're not into double dribble, maybe you're into betting.

201
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:30,078
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, coming to Super Smash Bros.

202
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:31,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I bet on double dribble games?

203
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,020
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

204
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:35,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming to Super Smash Bros.

205
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:39,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl is a spectator mode, and they will have online betting.

206
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh!

207
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo is encouraging gambling!

208
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:43,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god!

209
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:49,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Send out all those stupid, uh, you know, parent groups or whatever.

210
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:51,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's ban the game.

211
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:52,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Now.

212
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:55,147
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll get your children knocked up as well.

213
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:59,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't spectator mode kind of stupid, though, because you don't know who you're watching?

214
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:00,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

215
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:00,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

216
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:02,037
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

217
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:33,156
[SPEAKER_13]: But at least I think if the person is on your friends list, you should be able to see their name, right?

218
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:34,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

219
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:34,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

220
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:46,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, it will allow you to observe, of course, players' battles, including the betting system, where you can use your hard-earned coins to wage your own combatants during brawl battles.

221
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:48,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And winning can pay off big, of course.

222
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,487
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also earn stickers.

223
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Hooray!

224
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:54,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Stickers!

225
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:55,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Like real stickers?

226
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Or fake game stickers?

227
00:12:57,172 --> 00:12:59,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Or real stickers?

228
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:00,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, tough.

229
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:01,535
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't get real stickers.

230
00:13:03,476 --> 00:13:06,198
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, I don't know.

231
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:08,959
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds neat, I guess.

232
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:13,702
[SPEAKER_11]: But once again, I have a feeling that people are going to be like, Hey, you can bet money on it.

233
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:16,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.

234
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:20,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if you're going to get people throwing matches and stuff.

235
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:23,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Like this big underground scheme?

236
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,497
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you can't, because you don't know who's playing in it.

237
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:28,618
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

238
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:33,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Odd1 says, all games should have a mechanic by which they mail you stickers.

239
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,921
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care if they're not related to the game, I also want stickers.

240
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:41,303
[SPEAKER_11]: So are you suggesting we go back to, was it the Activision patch system that they had?

241
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:42,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

242
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you think about it, Xbox Live achievements are indirectly inspired by the old Activision patch thing.

243
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,577
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I think they should do?

244
00:13:51,118 --> 00:13:51,938
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Activision.

245
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:54,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Please tell me someone from Activision is listening.

246
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's a fabulous idea.

247
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:03,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Put all those old Activision games together yet again in one of those bundles, but have the achievements be the old patches you used to get.

248
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:08,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, when you would get so many points in a game, then you can unlock the little picture of that patch.

249
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:09,605
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be kind of cool.

250
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:18,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though we've seen those Activision packs like a million times for different consoles or whatever, I think one more would be kind of cool for nothing else but that, and maybe put some Xbox Live in it.

251
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,002
[SPEAKER_13]: and put Oink in it for God's sake.

252
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Oink was awesome.

253
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:25,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

254
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Rant.

255
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:27,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Oink.

256
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess what store is promising Wheeze?

257
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,340
[SPEAKER_13]: T.J.

258
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:35,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Maxx

259
00:14:54,351 --> 00:15:01,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to live right next to one, and it's basically just like Ross Dress for Less, but like one step above it.

260
00:15:01,556 --> 00:15:03,457
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's a step above.

261
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:06,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think it's really on the same tier as like Ross Dress for Less.

262
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So how TJ Maxx got Wii bundles is beyond me.

263
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,043
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what makes this story funny for those that don't understand.

264
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:13,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, is TJ Maxx nationwide?

265
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:15,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we had him in Mobile.

266
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay, then they're pretty nationwide.

267
00:15:17,347 --> 00:15:17,847
[SPEAKER_13]: They have him here.

268
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,209
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really ghetto.

269
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:20,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Overseas.

270
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,010
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like...

271
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,504
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Maxx is an interesting place.

272
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:52,449
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

273
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you like golf attachments and tennis racket attachments.

274
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,211
[SPEAKER_13]: And the potato chip holder that will also hold your Wiimote.

275
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:17,152
[SPEAKER_13]: They never released that because it sucks.

276
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:17,932
[SPEAKER_13]: God damn it.

277
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:19,693
[SPEAKER_13]: That thing actually looked kind of cool.

278
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:20,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Just buy a damn bowl.

279
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:21,514
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

280
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:22,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Put your chips in.

281
00:16:22,554 --> 00:16:25,996
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't need a fucking little thing.

282
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we cleanse the palate with the undead?

283
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:31,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

284
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies are great.

285
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:34,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I love The Undead.

286
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:35,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, loathe The Undead.

287
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:36,432
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

288
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:38,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's turn zombies loose in TJ Maxx.

289
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:44,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I would totally, totally film that and sell it as a movie.

290
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:44,653
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

291
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:57,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, for those of us who love The Undead, who dig their zombies, House of the Dead 2 and 3 are going to be on Wii, using the Wii Zapper.

292
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can shoot your zombies in the head.

293
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:06,773
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't have to press A. Fuck House of the Dead.

294
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,354
[SPEAKER_13]: I want Typing of the Dead on Wii.

295
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that they support the USB keyboards.

296
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:11,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's true, that's true.

297
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they put out that patch a while back, and now they support the USB keyboards.

298
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,281
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love House of the Dead.

299
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,943
[SPEAKER_13]: And I love Typing of the Dead.

300
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:22,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had House of the Dead 2 on Dreamcast.

301
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:24,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That was freaking sweet.

302
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,529
[SPEAKER_13]: I have Typing of the Dead on GameTap.

303
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:28,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I had Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast.

304
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,551
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I might as well.

305
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:30,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

306
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:32,612
[SPEAKER_11]: This new pack is actually kind of neat.

307
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:42,015
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm seeing Sega releasing some of these gun games, and hopefully they'll release more, because I know with Ghost Squad they started that off, and of course they're going to use the Wii Zapper.

308
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:52,998
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing which no one else has really mentioned so far, other than the fact that it's coming out in March, is that it's also going to be priced the same as Ghost Squad, which is $29.99 retail.

309
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,480
[SPEAKER_11]: So you may be thinking, oh hey, $50 for games that don't look that great on the Wii...

310
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:06,511
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only $30, and it's actually a pretty good collection, and hopefully it's as good as Ghost Squad, because Ghost Squad is pretty fun, and I think a lot of people are going to overlook it.

311
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:09,193
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's zombies being shot in the face by your Wiimote.

312
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:09,994
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, come on.

313
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that is kind of cool.

314
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I love shooting zombies.

315
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:14,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And look at it this way.

316
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:15,678
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not the movie.

317
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Just zombies are great, okay?

318
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:21,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies are great.

319
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:22,503
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

320
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombies are great.

321
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:25,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways...

322
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:37,974
[SPEAKER_11]: So another thing that you're going to probably be pissed off about, especially if you just bought a DS, is that there's a rumor saying that there's another DS redesign coming your way.

323
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:51,260
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, it's supposed to happen after the holiday sales kind of die out, probably next spring, which is kind of interesting because spring is when they released the last revision, the DS Lite.

324
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,875
[SPEAKER_11]: The rumor is that it's thinner.

325
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,076
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to have a Game Boy Advance port.

326
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,577
[SPEAKER_11]: It will have onboard storage and larger screens.

327
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:09,242
[SPEAKER_13]: So... And you know that onboard storage is going to then be used by all the cool games that come out next, so everybody has to upgrade to one of these things.

328
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:09,762
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

329
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:14,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo, I just bought this fucking thing like three months ago, and already...

330
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:16,814
[SPEAKER_13]: You're thinking about making me upgrade.

331
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:17,715
[SPEAKER_13]: You bastards.

332
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:21,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I just bought a DS Lite myself, too, so I don't have to play my wife's pink one.

333
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:23,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought a nice black one.

334
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Haven't played anything on it, though, yet.

335
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have my white one, and I like it.

336
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:29,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, I had to get a pink Advance back in the day.

337
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:33,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, people in the chat room are screaming, rumor, rumor, rumor.

338
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:36,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's a rumor, but honestly, would it surprise you?

339
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,750
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, really, think about it.

340
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at Nintendo's track record.

341
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, do you see why this is popping up everywhere?

342
00:19:42,254 --> 00:19:43,575
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it definitely...

343
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:45,829
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds true to me!

344
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:36,244
[SPEAKER_13]: The Game Boy Advance SP The DS I have all of those too And now one more DS Whatever they're going to call this thing DS Slim and Light They'll call it the DS Uber DS Rape Because that's what I keep feeling Super DS

345
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:42,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Tiger Claw, oh yes, Tiger Claw says the next version of DS will probably be the DS Micro.

346
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:44,799
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, the advanced Micro.

347
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a Game Boy Micro.

348
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,181
[SPEAKER_13]: You're probably the only person I know that has a Game Boy Micro.

349
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:49,322
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't pay for it either.

350
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,606
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still selling those at work.

351
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:56,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Or should I say we still have the same 10 that we've had since...

352
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:58,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Game Boy Micro

353
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:20,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Jamie's Puzzle Fighter, I could see that.

354
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:22,168
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's got interchangeable fails.

355
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:24,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried playing Kingdom Hearts on it and that did not work.

356
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I couldn't read.

357
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:28,810
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even worse is playing a shooter on that damn thing.

358
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't happen.

359
00:21:30,711 --> 00:21:33,952
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not play a shooter on...

360
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:43,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you remember back in the day on the old school Game Boys, they used to have the magnify and light things that you could put on top of them, these really hideous things.

361
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:44,505
[SPEAKER_07]: But they worked.

362
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,646
[SPEAKER_13]: They would slightly magnify the screen and light, and you'd totally get a headache.

363
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:50,587
[SPEAKER_13]: They need that for the micro, like a magnify thing.

364
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Would that kind of defeat the purpose of buying a micro in the first place?

365
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:54,869
[SPEAKER_13]: You know people would buy it.

366
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:56,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're dumb, right?

367
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:57,750
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

368
00:21:58,544 --> 00:21:59,245
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

369
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:32,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Microsoft improperly allowed his underage kid to use his debit card to subscribe to Xbox Live and automatically renew the subscription without authorization.

370
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,921
[SPEAKER_13]: He says that in October 2005, this is being done by Francisco Garcia in Georgia.

371
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:47,644
[SPEAKER_13]: He says in October 2005, his son Silvario used his debit card to buy a $50 one-year subscription to Xbox Live.

372
00:22:48,829 --> 00:22:54,190
[SPEAKER_13]: A year later, Microsoft automatically billed him for an additional year of Xbox Live without his knowledge or consent.

373
00:22:54,971 --> 00:23:01,612
[SPEAKER_13]: And he says that the charge sent his checking account into overdraft and that the bank slapped him with a $35 penalty.

374
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:08,514
[SPEAKER_13]: This is why you should be careful when using your debit card as a credit card, but never mind.

375
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:16,376
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the plaintiff goes on to say that Microsoft refunded the subscription fee but would not cover the bank penalty.

376
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:22,603
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually would be a son that committed fraud because a son would have had to put it in his father's name to go through.

377
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:26,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Nowhere is it said how in the hell the kid got the debit card in the first place.

378
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:41,282
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess that's not important.

379
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:54,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Garcia goes on to say that Microsoft broke Georgia law when it allowed his kid to use a debit card to sign up for Xbox Live and then continue to break the law when it renewed the service without written authorization.

380
00:23:54,745 --> 00:24:03,047
[SPEAKER_13]: He's speaking unspecified damages and asking the court to broaden the case to include all Xbox Live customers in Georgia with similar problems.

381
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:06,848
[SPEAKER_13]: So in other words, kids that steal their dad's wallet and use the cards to buy things.

382
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Xbox's fault.

383
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:18,241
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I've seen how hefty the authorization process is to that because I couldn't use my debit card.

384
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:21,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to use one of my other credit cards to run it through.

385
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:25,623
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, they're very specific on putting in the information.

386
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:29,824
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have the complete billing information for the person who owns the card.

387
00:24:30,244 --> 00:24:30,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore...

388
00:24:31,724 --> 00:24:34,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not Microsoft's fault.

389
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:39,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, first of all, that guy's fault for letting his kid be able to get into his wallet so easily.

390
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:44,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And second of all, it's the kid's issue for basically committing fraud.

391
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:46,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, but yet there's more.

392
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:49,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, technically, that's borderline on identity theft.

393
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you want to hear about the kid committing fraud?

394
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:51,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's more.

395
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:52,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's more, Jamie.

396
00:24:53,012 --> 00:25:05,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Microsoft has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, saying that they have paperwork that proves that the child misrepresented his age when he subscribed to Xbox Live by falsely stating that he was 18 years old.

397
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:06,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

398
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:13,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even though he would have had to have done it under his parents' name for it to have gone through.

399
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,099
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's... What's the chatroom saying?

400
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:17,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, chatroom.

401
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,240
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkDeadSuya says...

402
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:21,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Nevermind credit card.

403
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:23,059
[SPEAKER_13]: This is why condoms were invented.

404
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,421
[SPEAKER_13]: That is brilliant.

405
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Our chatter of the week, everybody.

406
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Dark Tetsuya, everybody.

407
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:29,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Round of applause.

408
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:29,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

409
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:30,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

410
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:31,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, no comments?

411
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:33,617
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just an idiot.

412
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:34,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

413
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:39,722
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't notice the charge was on his credit card in the first place, and then it rebuilt itself.

414
00:25:39,802 --> 00:25:40,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, seriously.

415
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:42,324
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you do something like that?

416
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:51,392
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is funny, though, because this must have been on an original Xbox account, because now, if your account runs out, all that happens is it turns into silver again.

417
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:52,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

418
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have an auto-renew option.

419
00:25:54,315 --> 00:25:54,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to renew it.

420
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,816
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no auto-renew.

421
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:57,738
[SPEAKER_13]: That auto-renew thing was...

422
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,378
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

423
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:28,927
[SPEAKER_13]: or let your kid steal it in the first place and put it on there and then not do anything about it the first time.

424
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:31,348
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, a year went by between.

425
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:33,329
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think this case has a lot of chances.

426
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:37,110
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not Microsoft's fault that your bank account was so low that you overdrafted.

427
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So you know what?

428
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,531
[SPEAKER_13]: If you didn't want to overdraft, use a real credit card that would have denied it if it was going to hit your limit.

429
00:26:44,232 --> 00:26:45,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I kind of agree.

430
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:51,457
[SPEAKER_13]: The bank should have denied the charge, but at the same time, this is how banks make money off of people who overdraft.

431
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's face it, that's one huge way they make money.

432
00:26:53,257 --> 00:27:00,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, on top of that, there's often times where a bank will write off an overdraft charge if it was erroneous, if it can be proven.

433
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:08,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's just really a case of this man in Georgia being a complete and utter moron.

434
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:09,526
[SPEAKER_04]: End of story.

435
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:13,267
[SPEAKER_13]: You deserve that $35 charge, dumbass.

436
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:15,277
[SPEAKER_13]: F.U.

437
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:15,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Time F.U.

438
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:15,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Time

439
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:49,719
[SPEAKER_04]: The first F you goes towards this man in the black Toyota truck who pulled out of the gas station and into my lane and cut me off.

440
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,020
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a stupid piece of shit.

441
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:56,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you totally deserve to have that, you know, cop car pull you over.

442
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that was a winner.

443
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:01,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Loki.

444
00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:04,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, my... Oh, it's two part, I'm sorry.

445
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,011
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to Rob.

446
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you said that was mine.

447
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,194
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I was like, okay.

448
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:10,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, that's okay.

449
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:10,975
[SPEAKER_13]: You go.

450
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:12,104
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be nice.

451
00:28:12,665 --> 00:28:13,025
[SPEAKER_13]: You sure?

452
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:13,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

453
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:15,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and I guess the two-part is F.U.

454
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:15,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob.

455
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:16,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, F.U.

456
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:16,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie!

457
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:17,347
[SPEAKER_13]: How's that?

458
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,528
[SPEAKER_13]: You're cutting in front of Loki to say F.U.

459
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:19,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie.

460
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:20,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Your mom.

461
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:21,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night.

462
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:21,689
[SPEAKER_13]: In bed.

463
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

464
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:29,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really have much to be angry about, but I am annoyed at the Priuses that were driving in front of me today.

465
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:31,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, owning a Prius means you drive slow.

466
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:36,257
[SPEAKER_11]: So, screw you, Prius owners, and I don't give a shit if you're helping the environment.

467
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:38,659
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not helping the environment because you're making me late.

468
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Or later.

469
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,140
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

470
00:28:43,113 --> 00:28:47,595
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to the macaroni and cheese pizza at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza because that shit was nasty.

471
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:48,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good!

472
00:28:48,676 --> 00:28:51,818
[SPEAKER_07]: The macaroni and cheese pizza was nasty.

473
00:28:51,838 --> 00:28:53,419
[SPEAKER_07]: The macaroni and cheese pizza was good.

474
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:55,820
[SPEAKER_04]: The peanut butter pizza was kind of weird.

475
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the peanut butter pizza too.

476
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: But the best was the barbecue chicken.

477
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:03,584
[SPEAKER_13]: The barbecue chicken Alfredo was okay.

478
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:05,886
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes the Incredibly Shitty Pizza not that shitty.

479
00:29:05,926 --> 00:29:07,767
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked the macaroni and cheese pizza though.

480
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:08,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you're weird.

481
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:09,908
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to Jamie twice.

482
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:15,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, F you back to your... F you infinity, plus one.

483
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:17,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can't add plus one to infinity.

484
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:20,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Because infinity is already infinity.

485
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:21,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just did.

486
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:22,829
[SPEAKER_13]: What are you going to do, tell God to smite me?

487
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the chat room just needs to be here.

488
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:32,231
[SPEAKER_13]: That silence, by the way, was Jamie actually praying.

489
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:35,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that was great radio, boys and girls, but there you have it.

490
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:40,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to point out though real quick about some of the previous stories.

491
00:29:40,768 --> 00:29:45,191
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68 had a great comment about the whole father and the kid thing.

492
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:50,374
[SPEAKER_13]: The father should cut his credit card and stab his kid with one of his sharp edges.

493
00:29:54,957 --> 00:29:55,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

494
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:58,719
[SPEAKER_13]: I almost think GS68 might have just taken the crown of Chatter of the Week.

495
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,861
[SPEAKER_13]: We might have to have a good old fight over this.

496
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:04,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

497
00:30:04,383 --> 00:30:05,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways...

498
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:08,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Flashback Consoles

499
00:30:35,738 --> 00:30:37,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

500
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:43,560
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, you know, what, they had such wonderful series that they sold off to Ubisoft Driver.

501
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, that was awesome.

502
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Such a wonderful game.

503
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,460
[SPEAKER_11]: It had no flaws at all.

504
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:48,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry.

505
00:30:50,461 --> 00:30:52,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Stuntman, that was okay.

506
00:30:52,942 --> 00:31:03,984
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, so yeah, the Test Drive series has been now licensed to InfoGames, which had, if I remember correctly, didn't they have the really cool, like, theme song that they made for their company?

507
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, it wasn't cool at all, but it was a theme song for their company.

508
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:14,026
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how I knew Atari was going downhill about 15 years ago?

509
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:18,609
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you ever play a game in the arcades called Pit Fighter?

510
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember Pit Fighter!

511
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:24,714
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this game was Atari, yes?

512
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,696
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it was Atari.

513
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:28,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Atari?

514
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,097
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucked.

515
00:31:29,157 --> 00:31:34,641
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was Mortal Kombat digitized, you know, type.

516
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Game Game Game Game

517
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:03,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, Jenga.

518
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:05,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Who thought that was a good idea?

519
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Odd1 says, Pit Fighter for Super Nintendo.

520
00:32:09,253 --> 00:32:11,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Proof that I was stupid as a child.

521
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:15,500
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay, Odd1.

522
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:19,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, Jenga, what the hell were you thinking?

523
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:24,838
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's hard enough to play the game as it is, but oh, let's play it the way, that'll be even easier.

524
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:33,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Because everyone wants to play, the only reason that people aren't playing Jenga is because it isn't set under the sea or in some fantastic fictional world.

525
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:35,383
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why people aren't playing Jenga.

526
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:38,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Not because, you know, it's Jenga or anything.

527
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, look at this box art.

528
00:32:42,031 --> 00:32:46,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the Sega Genesis version, which was put out by Tengen and, yes, developed by Atari.

529
00:32:46,652 --> 00:32:47,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at this.

530
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot about the Dominatrix lady fighter they had in it.

531
00:32:51,973 --> 00:32:54,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this is a horrible fucking game.

532
00:32:54,154 --> 00:32:55,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is the guy just in his underwear?

533
00:32:56,094 --> 00:32:57,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's what they wore when they fought.

534
00:32:57,714 --> 00:33:00,275
[SPEAKER_13]: It was panties.

535
00:33:01,295 --> 00:33:02,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Dominatrix fighter.

536
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:03,416
[SPEAKER_04]: They would be manties.

537
00:33:03,936 --> 00:33:04,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, manties.

538
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:07,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Digitized Mantis.

539
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,072
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you have to look forward to in Pit Fighter.

540
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:11,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, good riddance, Atari.

541
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:12,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Your time is up.

542
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Your 15 minutes are over.

543
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:15,199
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

544
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Loki jumped the gun a little bit because we were actually supposed to have the mailbag segment before that.

545
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:20,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Eh, whatever.

546
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:20,585
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right.

547
00:33:21,206 --> 00:33:23,188
[SPEAKER_13]: We can be fluid here on the show.

548
00:33:23,288 --> 00:33:25,491
[SPEAKER_13]: We can change things around on the fly.

549
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So, DarkSakura, are you ready to do some mailbags?

550
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:28,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure!

551
00:33:29,025 --> 00:33:37,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, when you send us emails at mailbag.orangelongeradio.com, Jamie will read the emails and she'll pick out her favorite emails and read them.

552
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:39,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what she's going to do right now here on the program.

553
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:40,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's open up the mailbag.

554
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:53,594
[SPEAKER_04]: First email comes from Robert M.

555
00:33:54,494 --> 00:33:58,295
[SPEAKER_04]: who is a regular writer, I would say, to our station.

556
00:34:01,816 --> 00:34:13,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I have a slight problem with my email because what happened is I had a problem with Firefox doing its... I'm going to close a new thing again!

557
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't reload all the windows, so let's go back to this.

558
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:23,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to clarify last week's letter, while playing the game to a podcast would indeed be a bizarre-

559
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:39,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say I listen to OLR Part A, 30 songs play days through my break at work.

560
00:34:40,303 --> 00:34:44,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I listen to 20 more songs, followed by a viewing of the latest Ask a Ninja episode.

561
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I sync my iPod to my computer, but the iPod and iTunes will completely forget that 50 songs and podcasts have been played.

562
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:51,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure why this is.

563
00:34:51,886 --> 00:34:54,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the 5th generation 30GB model, if that makes any difference.

564
00:34:56,027 --> 00:35:00,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, any idea by Nintendo doesn't add an option to view the most recently added Miis.

565
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:12,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Since two of the four options, one of which is the default, show that most popular Miis assumes that the most popular Miis can only get more popular and the newer ones get entirely overlooked.

566
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,793
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever see any Miis who look vaguely like members of the U.S.

567
00:35:16,213 --> 00:35:17,733
[SPEAKER_04]: whose line is it anyway, let me know.

568
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:25,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking forward to your next show, Robert M. That would be nice, but it'll never happen because they're lazy.

569
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:29,576
[SPEAKER_04]: That has been sort of proven.

570
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:30,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Next one.

571
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:45,355
[SPEAKER_04]: and actually we got an email from someone who's asking technical questions on the station which I will actually be replying to off of the air but I'm acknowledging that we received one from DJ Mikey Mike which I think is actually kind of funny.

572
00:35:47,357 --> 00:35:59,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we got a review of a game from Xenocore who actually sent the email about Ore no Riori which we had Rob look up and

573
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:07,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Ola, the Xbox 360 controller is a good addition to my control set for my PC.

574
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:09,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I use it for my classic games quite often.

575
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:13,052
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I wonder if anyone else is having the same issue that I am.

576
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:17,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I test the inputs for the controller, both triggers seem to be on the same axis.

577
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:21,993
[SPEAKER_04]: If I use the left trigger, the axis goes to 0%, and if I pull the right one, it goes to 100%.

578
00:36:22,273 --> 00:36:24,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull both of the axes, it stays at 50%.

579
00:36:26,056 --> 00:36:30,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the right stick will only show movement in the low left to high right diagonal.

580
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:32,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't use it as a second analog control.

581
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:33,281
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

582
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:36,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Microsoft made PC controls better than this.

583
00:36:36,784 --> 00:36:40,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, it's just the crack my roomie snuck into my food.

584
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:42,128
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing.

585
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:42,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm?

586
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:53,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Since my question had folks guessing, allow me to tell you why I seek the knowledge that I do with a quick review of Ore no Ryori for the PS1 Japan.

587
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,294
[SPEAKER_04]: My cooking, as it is known in the US, is a DualShock-centered cooking simulation.

588
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:06,443
[SPEAKER_04]: The player is a head chef of a cooking establishment that has you preparing various dishes depending on the restaurant's theme, ramen, fast food, etc.,

589
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:13,511
[SPEAKER_04]: To use the first stage as an example, you take the customer's order as they walk in, start the soup for the ramen, chop the vegetables for the ramen, the thinner the better.

590
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:19,012
[SPEAKER_04]: One stick is used for your hand position, the other controls the chef's knife.

591
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:24,794
[SPEAKER_04]: You take the soup off of the heat before it burns, you put the ramen in the brim, blah blah, okay, you cook ramen.

592
00:37:25,594 --> 00:37:28,435
[SPEAKER_04]: The game comes in here, you have six seats that can be full at one time.

593
00:37:28,855 --> 00:37:32,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Managing what you work on and when is the name of the game.

594
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Fall behind in your prep time, your orders will pile up.

595
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:39,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, isn't there a flash game like that on Yahoo?

596
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:42,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Except you're just serving people.

597
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:43,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Diner Dash?

598
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:44,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Diner Dash, that's it.

599
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:48,109
[SPEAKER_04]: While you were running the restaurant, other random events occurred.

600
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:51,551
[SPEAKER_04]: These show up as attacks on the other players in versus mode.

601
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:53,232
[SPEAKER_04]: A customer may leave without paying.

602
00:37:53,252 --> 00:38:00,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to chase him down, kill the roaches that flood into the restaurant with your shoe, call the police on wandering drunks that enter the restaurant, and washing dishes.

603
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:02,798
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a link here on that.

604
00:38:03,393 --> 00:38:04,433
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is a blast to play.

605
00:38:04,453 --> 00:38:10,896
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like Cookie Mama and want to feel like a short order cook from Rolf House, give this game a shot.

606
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,577
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes Cookie Mama look like a walk in the park.

607
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:15,358
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, this game is especially worthy of a spot in your import collection.

608
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:15,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

609
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:19,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you won't kick Cookie Mama to the curb after playing this one.

610
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,861
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, keep up the good work on the show.

611
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:22,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Yours truly, Xenocore.

612
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma is suggesting Iron Chef for the Wii.

613
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:29,044
[SPEAKER_13]: And SonOfDad in chatroom is suggesting Hell's Kitchen for the Wii.

614
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:30,624
[SPEAKER_13]: I would check it out, yeah.

615
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:30,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

616
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:31,705
[SPEAKER_13]: People do play stuff on PS1.

617
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:54,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Howdy, OR!

618
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:58,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard Sky mention a fondness for old-school Zork and an enthusiasm I share.

619
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:05,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you guys might be interested in this, and this is www.ifcomp.org, I-F-C-O-M-P.

620
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the few yearly contests this one just wrapped up for Homebrew Text Adventures.

621
00:39:10,665 --> 00:39:15,890
[SPEAKER_04]: There's quite a community out there of interactive fiction enthusiasts.

622
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:24,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I've designed a half-assed IF game or two, but never finished anything, so I think that these intrepid designers deserve a round of applause.

623
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:27,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage anyone interested in the medium to check it out.

624
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:32,267
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be used in some fascinating ways and often surpasses gaming in story and character development.

625
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:33,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, keep keeping on.

626
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:34,347
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys rock.

627
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:34,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Atreyu.

628
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:40,429
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I want to say about a year ago, there was somebody that did an Orange Lounge Radio Text Adventure game.

629
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:41,729
[SPEAKER_13]: I seem to remember playing it.

630
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki Yeah, it's this question again.

631
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:15,459
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the story behind them and when did you start using those names?

632
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,565
[SPEAKER_04]: As for mine, Osfer, it's simply a cross between Zephyr, one of my favorite Bimani songs, and Austin, which is my real name.

633
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:25,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess you wanted us to know if we were reading it online.

634
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:29,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Random comment, Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions is my new anti-drug.

635
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:29,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Osfer.

636
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:30,833
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

637
00:40:32,174 --> 00:40:35,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you'll do what you want, but I still insist Restore for the Sega Genesis.

638
00:40:36,542 --> 00:40:39,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried to describe this game to people and I get weird looks, but trust me, it's a gem.

639
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:39,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Play it.

640
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:40,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I've played it.

641
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:43,208
[SPEAKER_04]: PPS, Yara, sponsored by Kmart.

642
00:40:44,048 --> 00:40:46,971
[SPEAKER_04]: P-P-P-S, I want to hear Loki rant in an English accent.

643
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:52,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe we can get Loki to tell us about his name in an English accent.

644
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:53,456
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not doing that.

645
00:40:53,856 --> 00:40:55,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you give us a jolly old story?

646
00:40:56,699 --> 00:40:57,880
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not even trying tonight.

647
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, tell us about your name.

648
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:02,864
[SPEAKER_11]: It's named after a Norse god.

649
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:05,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I started using it when I was playing Cusar.

650
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:06,868
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot.

651
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,810
[SPEAKER_11]: OMG, you didn't get it from Dogma?

652
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:10,750
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

653
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, if anything, I got it from The Mask.

654
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:15,894
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

655
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:16,794
[SPEAKER_11]: There you have it.

656
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:21,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, mine was... I used to be a Japanese major when I lived in Alabama.

657
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:22,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Go fig.

658
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:25,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually going into the JET program, which is why I was doing it.

659
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:34,006
[SPEAKER_04]: But our teacher decided that she would give all of us names in Japanese in class so that when we were...

660
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:38,228
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

661
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:02,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you were emo.

662
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:05,333
[SPEAKER_04]: This was pre-emo.

663
00:42:06,093 --> 00:42:08,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, but you're always on the cutting edge, Jamie.

664
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:08,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

665
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:29,800
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other funny thing about this is that I met somebody on AOL who went by EvilSakura who was mad at me for getting DarkSakura, but it turned out her boyfriend knew Dan because Dan at the time had RichterDX, as in DraculaX, and

666
00:42:30,572 --> 00:42:30,993
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com

667
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:41,422
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

668
00:43:10,748 --> 00:43:12,869
[SPEAKER_13]: But that name is taken on a lot of sites.

669
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:16,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently there are five other green skies out there, so it's hard to use that name.

670
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:19,593
[SPEAKER_13]: So at one point I decided to spell sky differently.

671
00:43:19,713 --> 00:43:22,875
[SPEAKER_13]: So you put an I-E instead of Y. So it was green sky.

672
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:24,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And then one day I said, I'm not green anymore.

673
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:25,836
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was just sky.

674
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,339
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the real deal, like how my name came about.

675
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,160
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just one constant evolution after another.

676
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not ski or grenski or whatever people say.

677
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,042
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just sky.

678
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:36,823
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

679
00:43:38,793 --> 00:43:48,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And to tell GZDR4EV, I actually had the name before there was a Dark Sakura, before there was a Sakura in Street Fighter.

680
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:55,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in college in 94, no, I started taking Japanese in early 95.

681
00:43:56,143 --> 00:43:57,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So this predates.

682
00:43:57,643 --> 00:44:04,327
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I did think it was funny that there was a Dark Sakura later, and I said that I should sue Capcom for name infringement.

683
00:44:04,627 --> 00:44:04,847
[SPEAKER_03]: You should.

684
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:05,327
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a joke.

685
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:05,748
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

686
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,128
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

687
00:44:06,874 --> 00:44:07,534
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be fun to watch.

688
00:44:30,498 --> 00:44:34,379
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, gaming news out of Brazil, and this is actually pretty awesome.

689
00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:47,243
[SPEAKER_13]: It's this company called TechToy, and what they're doing is that they're basically licensing from Sega the right to make an official portable Genesis, or if you will, Mega Drive.

690
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,264
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an official portable Mega Drive, and it has a little controller and three buttons on it.

691
00:44:53,364 --> 00:44:58,506
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say it looks like a Game Boy Micro, but bigger, and it has the buttons on it, and it has 20 games.

692
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:09,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Alex Kidd, Sonic & Knuckles, Golden Axe, Echo the Dolphin, and of course the color of the unit is blue, just like Sega.

693
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:12,254
[SPEAKER_13]: The 20 games are already pre-installed on the unit.

694
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:17,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, you can't add to them or take away from them once you have the 20 games.

695
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:17,998
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all you get.

696
00:45:18,878 --> 00:45:23,101
[SPEAKER_13]: It runs on three AAA batteries.

697
00:45:23,782 --> 00:45:24,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of interesting.

698
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It will cost about the Brazilian equivalent of $100 US.

699
00:45:29,702 --> 00:45:34,905
[SPEAKER_13]: December 5th is the day it comes out, just in time for Brazilian Christmas, which there will be no snow.

700
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you something about that.

701
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:37,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there might be.

702
00:45:37,146 --> 00:45:41,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Brazil's a big country, and there's lots of mountain ranges, but I think it's the other time of year over there.

703
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:52,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something about that is that actually Dan was pointing out to me, and this was a couple years ago that he pointed out to me, is that the Sega Master System actually still has a very big following in Brazil.

704
00:45:53,644 --> 00:46:11,535
[SPEAKER_04]: and because a lot of the Master System sites that he found or even a lot of ROMs that he found when we both used to be heavy into emulation were games that were Genesis games that we knew on the Genesis but had been put out for Master System because they had come out over there on Master System.

705
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:16,587
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all of our Brazilian listeners, of which there ought to be a few, because Brazil's a big fucking place, right?

706
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:18,488
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just as big as the U.S.

707
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:19,088
[SPEAKER_13]: almost, right?

708
00:46:19,428 --> 00:46:26,451
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think all our, if not bigger, Brazilian listeners should get together and pool money enough.

709
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:32,733
[SPEAKER_13]: If everybody chips in, let's say there's 10 people listening to Brazil, I'll chip in $10 and send us one of these, because it sounds kind of funnish.

710
00:46:33,314 --> 00:46:34,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll fully pay for one.

711
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:39,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me know what the ratio is, and I'll totally pay for one.

712
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:39,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

713
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:41,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I want one.

714
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:45,232
[SPEAKER_13]: I want one too, but I don't want to have to pay for it because I'm cheap.

715
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:48,113
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

716
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:49,633
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

717
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, so that's all I got to say on the portable Mega Drive.

718
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:54,075
[SPEAKER_13]: It is out in Brazil.

719
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:55,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Or coming out soon.

720
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:58,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this makes me a very, very sad panda.

721
00:46:58,396 --> 00:46:59,416
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

722
00:46:59,456 --> 00:47:00,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm not a panda.

723
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:03,118
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes you a sad Jamie?

724
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:04,318
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me a sad me.

725
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:05,858
[SPEAKER_04]: But not an MII.

726
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:06,599
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what is it?

727
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:07,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff!

728
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:07,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff!

729
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:13,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Universe Online, there's actually a rumor of cancellation going out.

730
00:47:13,618 --> 00:47:19,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been stated that the MMO has run into, quote, serious, potentially stalling developmental troubles.

731
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:27,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I find it funny that my reference here, which is on Joystick, said that probably because everyone wants to be Wolverine.

732
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:30,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Not me!

733
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:32,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So apparently it wasn't Banjo-Kazooie.

734
00:47:34,248 --> 00:47:36,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, is that the big name game that looks like it's getting cancelled?

735
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:37,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvel, huh?

736
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that supposed to be an Xbox 360 exclusive?

737
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:41,693
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was on PS3 and Xbox.

738
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:42,053
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

739
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:42,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

740
00:47:43,174 --> 00:47:46,335
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a big deal then, because that was like Xbox's MMO.

741
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,837
[SPEAKER_13]: It was only going to be playable on that system.

742
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:53,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because it wouldn't have totally been just exactly like City of Heroes or anything like that.

743
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,201
[SPEAKER_11]: But it would have been Marvel.

744
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:56,061
[SPEAKER_11]: It might have been kind of cool.

745
00:47:57,402 --> 00:47:58,143
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

746
00:47:58,363 --> 00:47:58,683
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

747
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,632
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see a fighting game.

748
00:48:01,872 --> 00:48:03,814
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to do that Mortal Kombat vs. DC.

749
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:04,855
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be pretty cool.

750
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:10,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so the King Kong game is coming out here pretty soon.

751
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, the King of Kong game?

752
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:13,324
[SPEAKER_11]: DVD.

753
00:48:13,645 --> 00:48:15,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Donkey Kong came out like 20 years ago.

754
00:48:15,707 --> 00:48:17,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, they're going to make a game based on this movie.

755
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:18,150
[SPEAKER_11]: You watch.

756
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:23,122
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of bad ideas out there and people are waiting to jump on that stuff.

757
00:48:23,382 --> 00:48:25,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio, bringing you the late breaking news.

758
00:48:25,684 --> 00:48:30,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hey kids, did you hear about that totally rad Donkey Kong that's coming out?

759
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:34,731
[SPEAKER_11]: No, listen dude, okay, the King of Kong game, okay?

760
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:37,072
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll play as the people playing Donkey Kong.

761
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:39,354
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like even better than Donkey Kong.

762
00:48:39,754 --> 00:48:41,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you're playing people playing Donkey Kong.

763
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:45,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so yeah, the DVD's coming out...

764
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:48,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon, in January.

765
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:49,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Being put out by New Line.

766
00:48:49,606 --> 00:48:51,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, we're doing something at our work for this thing.

767
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:55,128
[SPEAKER_11]: They're having me set up some sort of Donkey Kong competition.

768
00:48:56,129 --> 00:48:57,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to have the guys there?

769
00:48:58,609 --> 00:48:58,669
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

770
00:48:58,689 --> 00:48:59,210
[SPEAKER_11]: They should come.

771
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,430
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're low budget, okay?

772
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:05,852
[SPEAKER_11]: They asked me to download the virtual console game, yet I see no monies for this.

773
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:10,354
[SPEAKER_11]: They said they'll pay me back later, and then they're going to put it on our big theater screen.

774
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:11,254
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um...

775
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:16,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Anywho, so yeah, it's going to be coming out apparently January 29th.

776
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:22,167
[SPEAKER_13]: But it'll be out on the internet long before.

777
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:28,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably as soon as screeners come out for that and people pirate that shit like crazy.

778
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:30,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there's already a version that's one of those cameras.

779
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:32,330
[SPEAKER_11]: The question is, why would you want to pirate this?

780
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

781
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:34,830
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard it's a good movie.

782
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:38,031
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good movie, but seriously, is it worth wasting a DVD for me?

783
00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:38,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

784
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:41,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see it.

785
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,115
[SPEAKER_11]: You should not talk negatively about this.

786
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:45,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not talking negatively about it.

787
00:49:45,222 --> 00:49:46,387
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just saying, no, it's like...

788
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

789
00:49:48,048 --> 00:49:50,489
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be like pirating Geely.

790
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:55,290
[SPEAKER_13]: The one crazy dude we met at all games, I think, is in this movie, Mr. Awesome.

791
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Was he there when you and I both went?

792
00:49:57,991 --> 00:49:59,812
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there was one time I went down there and he was there.

793
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:02,033
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it might have been a different time when I was there by myself.

794
00:50:03,493 --> 00:50:05,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been just you because I don't remember.

795
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:05,594
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so.

796
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:07,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I was there one time by myself because I was there on a trip.

797
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he was in the movie.

798
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:12,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, I'd remember someone named Mr. Awesome.

799
00:50:14,229 --> 00:50:15,850
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean... Wasn't he at... Was he at E3?

800
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:16,971
[SPEAKER_13]: He was probably at E3 that year.

801
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:17,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck if I know.

802
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:18,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

803
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:21,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone named Mr. Awesome needs to be punched in the face.

804
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:22,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

805
00:50:23,096 --> 00:50:24,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Mr. Awesome!

806
00:50:24,357 --> 00:50:25,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you're gonna die.

807
00:50:25,638 --> 00:50:28,760
[SPEAKER_13]: This guy... was interesting.

808
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,282
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really no other word to describe.

809
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:32,583
[SPEAKER_13]: He was one of the most interesting fellows I've ever met.

810
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:34,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sure he was interesting.

811
00:50:34,525 --> 00:50:35,426
[SPEAKER_13]: You're all retarded!

812
00:50:35,826 --> 00:50:38,528
[SPEAKER_13]: No, just... I'm not gonna talk negatively, Loki.

813
00:50:38,548 --> 00:50:39,849
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not gonna have that on this program.

814
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:41,230
[SPEAKER_13]: He was just interesting.

815
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:43,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

816
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:50,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Also interesting is the fact that another movie is being made into a hip new game.

817
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:51,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Ghostbusters!

818
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:54,691
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not talking about that old ass Commodore 64 game.

819
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:55,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Although that game was rad.

820
00:50:56,272 --> 00:50:58,753
[SPEAKER_13]: That was one of the first Commodore 64 games I ever remember owning.

821
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:01,375
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe this was on the 2600 and all the other systems.

822
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:04,457
[SPEAKER_13]: But there was a new Ghostbusters game coming out.

823
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:05,658
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a remake of the old one.

824
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:07,519
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a brand new Ghostbusters game.

825
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,703
[SPEAKER_13]: This being previewed by an issue of Game Informer Magazine.

826
00:51:12,003 --> 00:51:16,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently some game footage has already hit the internet, although it's kind of a bit of a rumor.

827
00:51:16,627 --> 00:51:17,888
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's been confirmed.

828
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:23,053
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to GhostbustersGame.com, there's a bunch of stuff there too.

829
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:31,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films, since they never did make a Ghostbusters 3, and now the actors are getting kind of old.

830
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:34,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the game is supposed to be a sequel to the first two films.

831
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:42,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Zootfly is developing it, and we don't know exactly what platforms it'll be on, but you can probably guess it'll be most of the next-gen systems.

832
00:51:43,397 --> 00:51:49,919
[SPEAKER_13]: I do kind of hope, though, it's on Wii, because I think that would be fun to try and not cross the streams on the Wii, with the whole zapping things.

833
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:52,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if it might be coming out on the Wii.

834
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:54,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the other great thing about it.

835
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, they are all actually a part of the game.

836
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:02,484
[SPEAKER_13]: They're apparently writing the script and doing all the voiceovers.

837
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:04,805
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is kind of cool to know that it's authentic.

838
00:52:05,226 --> 00:52:07,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Please don't suck this game.

839
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:09,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if Zootfly is actually developing it, though.

840
00:52:09,828 --> 00:52:11,709
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that they were doing something similar.

841
00:52:11,809 --> 00:52:13,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is actually NVIDIA.

842
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,991
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same team that worked on... Oh my bad, I'm sorry.

843
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,712
[SPEAKER_13]: It was originally rumored at Zootfly.

844
00:52:16,772 --> 00:52:20,714
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same team that put together the Scarface game, so, you know.

845
00:52:22,657 --> 00:52:23,898
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

846
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:38,781
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGame.com

847
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:54,699
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty good.

848
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to try and find... Here's the game.

849
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, this looks like the game itself.

850
00:53:00,122 --> 00:53:00,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.

851
00:53:00,462 --> 00:53:01,722
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like an actual first person.

852
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:02,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't listen to this.

853
00:53:02,522 --> 00:53:02,983
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks cool.

854
00:53:03,003 --> 00:53:04,243
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like Resident Evil, but like Ghostbusters.

855
00:53:04,263 --> 00:53:07,044
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like about it is that it's an over-the-shoulder view and not a first person.

856
00:53:20,424 --> 00:53:22,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that's highly inappropriate to do to give me such subpar...

857
00:53:50,959 --> 00:54:04,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I have noticed something that if you try to click on the video in window to the next sometimes it'll leave the old thing copied.

858
00:54:04,946 --> 00:54:05,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Brilliant.

859
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:07,227
[SPEAKER_04]: That happened to me with the paddle cap.

860
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here we go.

861
00:54:09,348 --> 00:54:11,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody grade out the G4 part in the beginning.

862
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:11,969
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

863
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:13,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I approve of this link.

864
00:54:20,285 --> 00:54:21,226
[SPEAKER_13]: That does look kind of fun.

865
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:22,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that is the Wii.

866
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:25,209
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a 360.

867
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:26,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the graphics look very 360.

868
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:27,551
[SPEAKER_11]: They do.

869
00:54:28,152 --> 00:54:31,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep going because there's a part where they show the Stay Puft Marshmallow.

870
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:32,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

871
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:36,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, they shot him in the face.

872
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:40,822
[SPEAKER_13]: That game looks like it's going to be kind of fun.

873
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:44,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

874
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:45,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Very cool.

875
00:54:45,806 --> 00:54:46,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play it.

876
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:50,655
[SPEAKER_04]: But guess what else I would play?

877
00:54:50,895 --> 00:54:53,838
[SPEAKER_10]: What else would you play?

878
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:55,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous.

879
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Luminous is a good game.

880
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:58,702
[SPEAKER_13]: I would play that too.

881
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous is coming to Windows.

882
00:55:01,645 --> 00:55:01,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

883
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:03,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it going to have Shinen?

884
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:04,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It better.

885
00:55:05,688 --> 00:55:09,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And it better have Heavenly Star and it better have everything else that's awesome about it.

886
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,793
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's going to be on Windows.

887
00:55:12,754 --> 00:55:13,435
[SPEAKER_04]: So isn't that cool?

888
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:14,733
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of cool.

889
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:21,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, then again, if you think about it, Luminous has been whored on every other thing out there, including my cell phone, so this does kind of make sense.

890
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:23,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I need Luminous for my iPhone.

891
00:55:24,557 --> 00:55:26,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me Luminous on my iPhone, I'll be happy.

892
00:55:26,818 --> 00:55:27,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep on dreaming.

893
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:32,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, you know what would be cool is a version of Luminous on your iPhone that uses the songs from your iPhone.

894
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:33,441
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be cool.

895
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:34,202
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be cool.

896
00:55:34,962 --> 00:55:35,362
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

897
00:55:36,002 --> 00:55:42,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Something not so cool is apparently R-Type Command, which is better known as

898
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,641
[SPEAKER_11]: R-Type Tactics

899
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:20,941
[SPEAKER_11]: It's being put out by Atlas, and I believe, if I remember correctly, it says, the game requires, or it says, excuse the lightning-fast reflexes needed to avoid enemy fire, instead offering a turn-based, hex-based strategic gameplay.

900
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:25,624
[SPEAKER_11]: You will not just control one ship, but a fleet of ships.

901
00:56:26,865 --> 00:56:27,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

902
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:28,646
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds stupid to me.

903
00:56:29,918 --> 00:56:31,298
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's tactics, it sucks.

904
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:31,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome!

905
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:33,359
[SPEAKER_11]: If by awesome you mean not at all, then yeah.

906
00:56:52,737 --> 00:56:55,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, yeah, not a game I'm very interested in checking out.

907
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:58,301
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, our type is cool and all, but it's not that cool, let's face it.

908
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:04,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Skype line, open for business, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on interact with us for all the details.

909
00:57:04,786 --> 00:57:10,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Our Skype name is Orange Lounge Radio, and our telephone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

910
00:57:11,031 --> 00:57:12,292
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how long we've been doing Skype?

911
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:13,212
[SPEAKER_13]: A long time.

912
00:57:13,312 --> 00:57:17,235
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we are actually like one of the first shows ever that use Skype.

913
00:57:17,836 --> 00:57:20,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the first, I don't know if we can stake that claim, but it might be worth a shot.

914
00:57:21,644 --> 00:57:22,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go to the phones!

915
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:24,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

916
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:26,286
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Jason.

917
00:57:26,607 --> 00:57:26,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello!

918
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:29,028
[SPEAKER_02]: The awesome, the awesome, the Jason, or something like that.

919
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:31,989
[SPEAKER_13]: The ex-awesome Jason, ex-awesome V, what's up?

920
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:38,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of curious, has anybody ever played Marble Mania on the Wii?

921
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Marble Mania on the Wii?

922
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:40,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Marble?

923
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:43,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Kororimpa Marble Mania, or Marvel?

924
00:57:43,735 --> 00:57:46,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Kororimpa Marble Mania.

925
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:53,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I have played Kororimpa, and my old roommate, known as Extifer on this program, was obsessed with that game for a little while, for like a week.

926
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:55,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And I played it too.

927
00:57:56,299 --> 00:57:59,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very, very cute and very interesting game.

928
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:04,443
[SPEAKER_02]: My old roommate from Arizona came up here, what, two weekends ago, I believe.

929
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:08,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the games that he owned, and I had never even heard of it before.

930
00:58:09,825 --> 00:58:13,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, to me, you know, I don't know how...

931
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:15,255
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

932
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:49,143
[SPEAKER_13]: and it made this little p-p-p-p noise and it was like really, really funny in a five-year-old kind of way.

933
00:58:49,403 --> 00:58:54,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But I never actually played with it, so I used the more mission-targeted ones.

934
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Check it out, it's hilarious.

935
00:58:55,726 --> 00:59:00,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, it was a Konami game, and they also did, you know, obviously DDR and Dewey's Adventure and all this other stuff.

936
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:01,488
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

937
00:59:01,868 --> 00:59:02,669
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't say.

938
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:10,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they came out around the same time as Wing Island as well, and they were both kind of very under-the-radar and kind of average games,

939
00:59:10,902 --> 00:59:17,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was kind of neat though because you could play two players on one controller if you had one person use the nunchuck and the other person use the remote.

940
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:18,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh.

941
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:21,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

942
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:26,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Well then, three cheers for Kurarimpa from our studly Jason.

943
00:59:26,874 --> 00:59:27,875
[SPEAKER_13]: What else have you been playing lately?

944
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:33,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been playing Super Paper Mario, which is immensely better than Paper Mario.

945
00:59:33,732 --> 00:59:37,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played Thousand Year Door, but Super Paper Mario is actually pretty addicting.

946
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,736
[SPEAKER_13]: You sound pretty in love with your Wii right now.

947
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:47,439
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not 360, which in this week it hasn't been so much, I go between the two.

948
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I was marching through Resident Evil 4, which I still haven't beaten.

949
00:59:54,062 --> 00:59:54,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Resident Evil...

950
00:59:56,637 --> 01:00:02,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Much like I revealed the I don't play Zeldas very often and everybody called me a blasphemer, I know, I'm sorry.

951
01:00:03,523 --> 01:00:09,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played Resident Evil 2 a couple times, but all of these kind of stopped not too terribly far into it.

952
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:16,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Code Veronica was the one game that I got, I think, about halfway through with, but I just kind of stopped playing it.

953
01:00:16,933 --> 01:00:19,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil 4, with the Wii controls...

954
01:00:20,222 --> 01:00:21,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Big exception.

955
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:25,404
[SPEAKER_02]: That made that game so unbelievably fun.

956
01:00:25,544 --> 01:00:30,185
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I haven't played Resident Evil 4 on the Wii yet, but honestly, I thought it was great on the GameCube.

957
01:00:30,225 --> 01:00:32,506
[SPEAKER_13]: So, like, the Wii would just add even more to it.

958
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:34,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Widescreen and motion controls sounds hot.

959
01:00:34,706 --> 01:00:41,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Widescreen, free aim pointing, that's the best part of it, is that you have the full screen to aim with the remote.

960
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:43,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes it the best, makes...

961
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:46,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's great.

962
01:00:46,312 --> 01:00:47,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fun to control.

963
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:48,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fun to play.

964
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:48,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds hot.

965
01:00:48,973 --> 01:00:51,954
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Jason, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but any other thoughts from our listeners?

966
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:57,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I own Metroid Prime Corruption, and I haven't even opened it and played it yet.

967
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God, that game is great.

968
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:00,638
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to do that now.

969
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:04,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but I have so many things I want to play.

970
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, Jason, tonight, you are to open that game tonight and play.

971
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:10,862
[SPEAKER_13]: You must.

972
01:01:11,142 --> 01:01:11,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't tell me no.

973
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,063
[SPEAKER_13]: You know you can't tell me no.

974
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:13,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm cute.

975
01:01:15,698 --> 01:01:16,218
[SPEAKER_13]: This is true.

976
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:16,779
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

977
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,919
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Jason, and say hi to Rye for us.

978
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:20,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Will do.

979
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:21,600
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, bye-bye.

980
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:22,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

981
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:33,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Our lovely webmaster, Jason, VXJason, X, awesome, X, V, sex, V, Jason, calling in.

982
01:01:33,842 --> 01:01:36,103
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or we could just take this call.

983
01:01:36,143 --> 01:01:37,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

984
01:01:37,223 --> 01:01:37,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

985
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:39,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Yo, what's up?

986
01:01:39,384 --> 01:01:40,024
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Ranma.

987
01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:41,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranny, what's up?

988
01:01:44,346 --> 01:01:58,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember a few weeks ago you talked about the movie Press Start?

989
01:02:00,169 --> 01:02:06,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, wasn't that that one that looked like this horrible, not even a B-movie, but a C-movie production?

990
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:11,071
[SPEAKER_13]: But not that that's necessarily a bad thing, done by total hardcore nerds.

991
01:02:13,035 --> 01:02:14,476
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fucking awesome!

992
01:02:14,516 --> 01:02:15,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you see it?

993
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:15,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it great?

994
01:02:16,758 --> 01:02:18,980
[SPEAKER_09]: My roommate ordered it and we watched it last night.

995
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, it was great!

996
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:26,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, without ruining it too much, tell us something that was really funny about it.

997
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:32,752
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the homages and the parodies and the respects they gave to old school gaming.

998
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:40,258
[SPEAKER_09]: The plot was very Final Fantasy-ish, the opening was Paperboy, and well, it went on from there.

999
01:02:41,252 --> 01:02:42,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Nudity Nearly Naked Chick

1000
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:04,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, that's right.

1001
01:03:04,996 --> 01:03:05,976
[SPEAKER_13]: That's close to nudity.

1002
01:03:05,996 --> 01:03:06,896
[SPEAKER_13]: That's partial nudity.

1003
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:07,517
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1004
01:03:08,517 --> 01:03:09,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Good times.

1005
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:10,818
[SPEAKER_13]: So, cool.

1006
01:03:10,838 --> 01:03:14,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we'll have to put that on our Christmas list to check out that movie.

1007
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything that you've been playing this week?

1008
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:16,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1009
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing Phantom Hourglass, and thanks to Jamie, I've been playing R.O.

1010
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:24,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dear.

1011
01:03:24,964 --> 01:03:25,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Watch out.

1012
01:03:25,444 --> 01:03:26,484
[SPEAKER_13]: The cancer is spreading.

1013
01:03:29,065 --> 01:03:29,826
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not bad.

1014
01:03:29,866 --> 01:03:32,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I fired up Age of Mythology.

1015
01:03:32,447 --> 01:03:33,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing that again.

1016
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:36,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, how come you're not on American Idol?

1017
01:03:50,939 --> 01:03:53,242
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1018
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:09,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Horrible.

1019
01:04:09,568 --> 01:04:12,730
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do, I mean, even though that's the end of it, I can do without.

1020
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:21,236
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's extremely flattering that people actually took the time to create something related to Orange Lounge Radio and some of our in-jokes.

1021
01:04:21,396 --> 01:04:22,737
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredibly flattering.

1022
01:04:22,797 --> 01:04:24,097
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you to everybody who was involved.

1023
01:04:24,117 --> 01:04:27,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I knew, like, probably like six different people contributed, stepfiles, backgrounds.

1024
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:29,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it was a group project.

1025
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:31,022
[SPEAKER_13]: So well done to all.

1026
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:32,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Definitely.

1027
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:36,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And after playing it, I suggested to DT we need to do something new.

1028
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:37,641
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1029
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:43,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then you'll have to get hard at work on OL Revolution Second Mix Plus.

1030
01:04:43,668 --> 01:04:44,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no.

1031
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:44,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Not dancing.

1032
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Not dancing.

1033
01:04:46,451 --> 01:04:46,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1034
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:47,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, a new game.

1035
01:04:47,712 --> 01:04:48,453
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1036
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:52,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I suggested Orange Lounge the Revolution, the fighting game.

1037
01:04:52,618 --> 01:04:53,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, wait.

1038
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,580
[SPEAKER_13]: What about – A new game, right?

1039
01:04:55,081 --> 01:04:55,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1040
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:58,825
[SPEAKER_13]: There was OLR versus AGI, wasn't there, at some point?

1041
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:04,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, before we get to that, we've got to have the first game, which would have to be Orange Lounge to Fighter.

1042
01:05:04,461 --> 01:05:04,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I see.

1043
01:05:05,141 --> 01:05:07,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Then AGI to Fighter, then the Versus match.

1044
01:05:07,722 --> 01:05:08,403
[SPEAKER_13]: I see, I see.

1045
01:05:08,463 --> 01:05:10,524
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will build to the Versus game.

1046
01:05:10,564 --> 01:05:10,964
[SPEAKER_13]: That's good.

1047
01:05:11,364 --> 01:05:11,644
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1048
01:05:11,924 --> 01:05:13,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you guys get to work on that.

1049
01:05:13,465 --> 01:05:16,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Any last thoughts for the Callers, Ranma, before we let you go?

1050
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:21,829
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we'd start this after the holidays, you know, when everybody's like, oh, let's make a Fighter.

1051
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:23,030
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

1052
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:26,692
[SPEAKER_13]: That's when I'm going to finally get around to redoing the website into something viewable.

1053
01:05:28,055 --> 01:05:28,976
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be around the holidays.

1054
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:29,376
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1055
01:05:29,996 --> 01:05:30,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care, Ranma.

1056
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:32,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Love you guys.

1057
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:32,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Later.

1058
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:33,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

1059
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:39,481
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1060
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:40,822
[SPEAKER_13]: All one word smooshed together.

1061
01:05:40,882 --> 01:05:42,263
[SPEAKER_13]: No spaces, no dashes, nothing.

1062
01:05:43,784 --> 01:05:44,084
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1063
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:49,385
[SPEAKER_13]: TheRobD says, good luck with the AG side, I'm one of the few fighting fans.

1064
01:05:49,685 --> 01:06:02,679
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess AGI's been on a bit of like, kind of like a little bit of a hiatus in the past few weeks, and I think that's because Scott's been going on the road, doing like a reality show type thing with these guys who are like a Counter-Strike team, I think it was.

1065
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,902
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched the pilot that he had posted, and it wasn't bad.

1066
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it because his writers went on strike?

1067
01:06:08,337 --> 01:06:08,938
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1068
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:37,446
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1069
01:06:45,108 --> 01:06:50,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw that bus, I'm like, oh my god, there's a Counter-Strike bus at that fucking next level place.

1070
01:06:50,233 --> 01:06:58,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we have a reason to have the OLR fighting game, because someone needs to punch Scott in the face for not calling us when... Well, obviously it was in Loki's backyard.

1071
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I was there, I went to see a movie, I'm like, god, there's a Counter-Strike bus here?

1072
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:07,107
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, why would they... Well, because it went to this land center next level or something.

1073
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:08,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Haven't we all been there?

1074
01:07:08,568 --> 01:07:10,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a customer that hates...

1075
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:16,611
[SPEAKER_11]: They're competing LAN centers or whatever, and they absolutely hate them, and they talk crap about them all day long.

1076
01:07:17,031 --> 01:07:19,792
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, so I saw them, like, why is there anyone here?

1077
01:07:19,852 --> 01:07:21,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, it's Eldorado Hills.

1078
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:24,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like, does anyone actually play LAN games here?

1079
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:26,316
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, there you have it.

1080
01:07:26,696 --> 01:07:34,300
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, we're going to go back to the phones, and we'll take another call, and then we're going to get into some last-minute stories.

1081
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Be someone awesome.

1082
01:07:36,121 --> 01:07:37,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1083
01:07:37,322 --> 01:07:37,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1084
01:07:38,482 --> 01:07:39,002
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up?

1085
01:07:40,276 --> 01:07:41,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?

1086
01:07:41,737 --> 01:07:42,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I said awesome!

1087
01:07:43,198 --> 01:07:43,639
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

1088
01:07:43,899 --> 01:07:50,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, not much, just chilling on this weekend, coming, basically just coming back from the tournament and whatnot.

1089
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:52,245
[SPEAKER_06]: What tournament was it this time?

1090
01:07:53,306 --> 01:07:54,447
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one out in Jersey.

1091
01:07:54,907 --> 01:08:00,571
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard of this arcade called Fun and Games, which is closing down for five months to relocate nearby.

1092
01:08:01,172 --> 01:08:04,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were just having a whole thing, shitloads of tournaments yesterday.

1093
01:08:04,434 --> 01:08:08,197
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the only arcade I've been to in Jersey is that eight on the break, which is pretty well known, I guess.

1094
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:09,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1095
01:08:09,238 --> 01:08:09,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1096
01:08:10,345 --> 01:08:21,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But besides that, I'm just, you know, just gloating over the fact that, you know, a game like Mario Galaxy can, you know, can be as evocative.

1097
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:24,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, last week you were so freaking excited.

1098
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:26,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you had so much energy last week when you called in.

1099
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:30,852
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is that it's like Mario, it basically plays like Mario 64.

1100
01:08:30,892 --> 01:08:34,693
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing plays like it, but with, you know, most controlled games.

1101
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:40,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It plays, it's motion, you know, it's basically Mario 64 motion controls and spikier graphics.

1102
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:55,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I mean, when you play Mario 64, I mean, you get that feeling of just, you know, that new, innovative, that new innovative, you know, gameplay where you just, you know, die instantly and you have life.

1103
01:08:56,117 --> 01:08:59,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas this one, I don't know, I guess it kind of...

1104
01:09:00,612 --> 01:09:01,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's what it boils down to.

1105
01:09:01,553 --> 01:09:04,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's what it boils down to, Zaku, is that did you have fun?

1106
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:06,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you have fun playing it, then it's good.

1107
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:06,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1108
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:15,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I just gotta give it a little bit more time since I only played it in the Nintendo World launch last week.

1109
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:18,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Then again, I haven't picked up the full game myself yet.

1110
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:22,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried to go to Toys R Us this week to pick up the game because they're doing that whole $25 gift card thing.

1111
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:24,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And once you know it, they didn't get the game the day it came out.

1112
01:09:24,812 --> 01:09:25,892
[SPEAKER_13]: There was some shipping delay.

1113
01:09:25,952 --> 01:09:26,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1114
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:30,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably some frickin' truck full of Super Mario Galaxies tipped over on the freeway or some shit.

1115
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,454
[SPEAKER_13]: So I didn't buy it.

1116
01:09:31,494 --> 01:09:35,435
[SPEAKER_13]: But we did that preview last week and I was lucky enough to get to play it for the 40 minutes.

1117
01:09:35,455 --> 01:09:36,315
[SPEAKER_13]: It was fun.

1118
01:09:36,395 --> 01:09:36,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoyed it.

1119
01:09:36,735 --> 01:09:38,976
[SPEAKER_06]: I would get a week for, you know, I would just

1120
01:09:39,403 --> 01:09:45,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I would seriously get a Wii if there was, you know, more in terms of a little bit more hardcore games.

1121
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:49,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're trying to stick to the, you know, trying to stay on the course of the whole casual thing.

1122
01:09:50,629 --> 01:09:53,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I already know Metroid and, you know, whatnot.

1123
01:09:54,331 --> 01:09:58,333
[SPEAKER_06]: But stuff like, I don't know, just gotta make good use of the motion controls.

1124
01:09:59,414 --> 01:10:03,216
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and especially the online stuff, that's pretty much lacking.

1125
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:05,957
[SPEAKER_06]: If they want to compete, you know, against Microsoft and Sony.

1126
01:10:06,097 --> 01:10:07,278
[SPEAKER_13]: But Brawl's gonna be sexy.

1127
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I hear.

1128
01:10:09,991 --> 01:10:13,053
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be the new game for anime conventions.

1129
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:14,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Lordy.

1130
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:20,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you're going to see a whole bunch of those Otaku folks just duking it out with the motion controls and whatnot.

1131
01:10:21,219 --> 01:10:23,780
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be the new tournament game in February.

1132
01:10:24,201 --> 01:10:27,023
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Zaku, any other thoughts for our listeners before we take some more calls?

1133
01:10:28,784 --> 01:10:34,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Just got to love the hypocrisy of people banning Mass Effect one day and unbanning it the other.

1134
01:10:34,608 --> 01:10:35,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking to you, C4.

1135
01:10:36,129 --> 01:10:36,549
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1136
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Rock on, Zaku!

1137
01:10:57,062 --> 01:10:59,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Mass Effect was... Oh, it's too much talking, though, right?

1138
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:01,543
[SPEAKER_13]: It's seriously 25 minutes to get into some action.

1139
01:11:01,563 --> 01:11:03,843
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like listening to the Skype segment of this program, right?

1140
01:11:03,863 --> 01:11:05,204
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not necessarily like that.

1141
01:11:05,264 --> 01:11:07,204
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1142
01:11:07,224 --> 01:11:08,905
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to set up the story, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1143
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:14,626
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny, though, because, like, you pick your backstory and stuff, and it's just, it's really... But there's lesbian sex.

1144
01:11:16,086 --> 01:11:20,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way... You get the name of your character, but they all call you by your last name because you can't change that.

1145
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,967
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're getting another call, sir.

1146
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:22,648
[SPEAKER_11]: We got to get to it.

1147
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:23,988
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, hi, you're on Orange Lost Radio.

1148
01:11:24,008 --> 01:11:24,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1149
01:11:25,049 --> 01:11:26,270
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Brad from PodCulture.

1150
01:11:42,722 --> 01:11:43,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes?

1151
01:11:43,623 --> 01:11:48,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Picked that up yesterday, and let me tell you, it's the most fun I've had in the game in a long time.

1152
01:11:48,468 --> 01:11:49,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what a lot of the reviews are saying.

1153
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:50,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you hear this week?

1154
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:56,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Mario Galaxy is now the official number one rated game ever on that...

1155
01:11:57,725 --> 01:12:00,426
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if it's Metacritic or one of those other game rankings.

1156
01:12:00,446 --> 01:12:00,846
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it is.

1157
01:12:00,866 --> 01:12:05,028
[SPEAKER_13]: GameRankings.com has surpassed Ocarina of Time as the number one game.

1158
01:12:05,068 --> 01:12:08,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Now granted, one negative review will fuck that all up at this point.

1159
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:11,270
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now it is the number one game of all time.

1160
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:15,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Which actually kind of surprised me because I thought generally Bioshock was getting better reviews this year.

1161
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:16,413
[SPEAKER_13]: But go fig.

1162
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:18,213
[SPEAKER_05]: People love their Nintendo.

1163
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played Bioshock yet.

1164
01:12:19,514 --> 01:12:20,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't judge on that.

1165
01:12:20,714 --> 01:12:25,016
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the first Wii game I've seen where the controls haven't felt tacked on.

1166
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:26,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh.

1167
01:12:27,216 --> 01:12:33,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this was the game, and I think a lot of people have kind of described it this way, this was the game that the Wii was kind of made for.

1168
01:12:34,459 --> 01:12:42,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, this was Miyamoto's big idea, like, here's how I want to do the next Mario game, and they're like, okay, Miyamoto, you're so fucking awesome, we'll build a console around it.

1169
01:12:43,884 --> 01:12:49,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, it's really cool, because it just feels natural in playing it, and it still, it was...

1170
01:12:51,619 --> 01:12:52,980
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1171
01:13:18,298 --> 01:13:24,001
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're in one of the hidden levels and you have to pick up the notes, it plays the little Super Mario Bros.

1172
01:13:24,021 --> 01:13:24,301
[SPEAKER_05]: scene.

1173
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:25,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's right.

1174
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:25,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember that.

1175
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:26,462
[SPEAKER_13]: That was cool.

1176
01:13:26,482 --> 01:13:28,183
[SPEAKER_13]: We saw that in one of the levels we played.

1177
01:13:28,323 --> 01:13:28,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Good times.

1178
01:13:30,383 --> 01:13:32,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else you've been playing lately besides Mario Galaxy?

1179
01:13:33,045 --> 01:13:37,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, too busy getting stuff ready for my girlfriend's trip to the hospital.

1180
01:13:38,607 --> 01:13:39,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no.

1181
01:13:39,347 --> 01:13:39,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry to hear that.

1182
01:13:39,888 --> 01:13:40,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope everything's okay.

1183
01:13:41,568 --> 01:13:42,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1184
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:42,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Just...

1185
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:44,500
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll have her in our thoughts.

1186
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And some plumbing removed.

1187
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:46,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

1188
01:13:46,601 --> 01:13:49,042
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we'll have her in our thoughts and hope everything is well.

1189
01:13:49,503 --> 01:13:52,404
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'll have to bring her a DS or some games to cheer her up.

1190
01:13:52,764 --> 01:13:53,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Or maybe some Doctor Who DVDs.

1191
01:13:53,644 --> 01:13:54,605
[SPEAKER_05]: We picked up Harvest Moon for her.

1192
01:13:54,985 --> 01:13:55,345
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

1193
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:58,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Picked up Harvest Moon for her Game Boy Advance.

1194
01:13:58,206 --> 01:13:58,687
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1195
01:13:58,727 --> 01:14:03,989
[SPEAKER_13]: That will keep a person occupied for a long-ass time to finally get anything accomplished in that game.

1196
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:04,649
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be great.

1197
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:10,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a call in and say that Super Mario is probably the...

1198
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:15,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Most fun in a long time on the game You think it's going to be game of the year?

1199
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:30,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's got a broader appeal than some of the other games that have been rating real high Like Battleshock won't appeal to everybody Or Halo 3 won't appeal to everybody But Mario Galaxy has more of a wider appeal, I think

1200
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:32,140
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a dang good point.

1201
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:32,641
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

1202
01:14:32,721 --> 01:14:43,470
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of the games that are kind of leading the race for Game of the Year right now may not have that same family-friendly, quote-unquote, appeal that Mario Galaxy has and that is so important during the Christmastime rush.

1203
01:14:43,731 --> 01:14:44,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good point.

1204
01:14:45,412 --> 01:14:47,494
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Brad, thank you so much for calling in as always.

1205
01:14:47,534 --> 01:14:51,378
[SPEAKER_13]: We'd love to hear from you and hope everything is okay for you this holiday season.

1206
01:14:51,418 --> 01:14:51,698
[SPEAKER_13]: All righty?

1207
01:14:52,378 --> 01:14:52,979
[SPEAKER_13]: All righty, guys.

1208
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:53,520
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1209
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care, buddy.

1210
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:54,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Later on.

1211
01:14:54,981 --> 01:14:55,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

1212
01:14:56,522 --> 01:14:57,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good point there.

1213
01:14:57,856 --> 01:15:02,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Mario Galaxy may not be the game of the year for the hardcore gamer, but certainly a broad game.

1214
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:08,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, we will be doing a grand Christmas show this year, just like we did last year, or I should say end of the year show.

1215
01:15:08,966 --> 01:15:10,748
[SPEAKER_13]: More details on that throughout the month of December.

1216
01:15:11,688 --> 01:15:12,409
[SPEAKER_13]: We have more calls.

1217
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:13,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1218
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1219
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:15,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what's up, guys?

1220
01:15:15,312 --> 01:15:15,872
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Robby.

1221
01:15:15,892 --> 01:15:16,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a while.

1222
01:15:16,793 --> 01:15:17,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, it has been a while.

1223
01:15:17,834 --> 01:15:18,455
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you, Rob?

1224
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:20,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Not too bad.

1225
01:15:20,056 --> 01:15:21,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I've mostly been working on Sunday's closing, so...

1226
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:25,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I work at a bookstore, so, you know, retail gets no time off.

1227
01:15:25,525 --> 01:15:27,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Gotcha, yeah, especially in the next few months.

1228
01:15:27,346 --> 01:15:29,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So I haven't been able to listen live in a while, so it's nice to hear you guys.

1229
01:15:30,087 --> 01:15:35,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's nice to have you on the program, and congratulations, you guys have got an icon as well on the Marketplace this week, I understand.

1230
01:15:36,269 --> 01:15:36,889
[SPEAKER_08]: That is true.

1231
01:15:37,049 --> 01:15:38,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we actually need to put out a show.

1232
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:40,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and your icon is very nice looking, too.

1233
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:41,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I was very impressed.

1234
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:43,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny story about that, actually.

1235
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:50,794
[SPEAKER_08]: We thought about just toning down our original iTunes artwork, but we figured that wouldn't be good enough for Xbox Live.

1236
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:51,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1237
01:15:51,622 --> 01:16:06,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I, uh, I went to one of the all-games chatters, DC Nate, uh, awesome guy, uh, and we talked a little bit about, came up with an idea for the clock and everything, and, uh, prepared all of that in, I think, four hours, because that was how much time we had left before, uh, the deadline came through.

1238
01:16:06,314 --> 01:16:13,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we had to get that stuff in fast, I remember that, because, like, it was... Yeah, because Black, Bobby was, uh, Bobby was very firm about the deadlines, and, uh,

1239
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,901
[SPEAKER_08]: He gave us warning and gave us some time, but it was a very hurried process.

1240
01:16:17,961 --> 01:16:18,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1241
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:25,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm actually going to show the chat some of the rejects for the icon, because we actually had a couple icons that were almost there, but they were rejected.

1242
01:16:25,723 --> 01:16:27,204
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to actually paste some of those in chat.

1243
01:16:27,524 --> 01:16:29,024
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to do the one I did.

1244
01:16:29,044 --> 01:16:32,325
[SPEAKER_13]: The one I did has the three faces, and I don't know how...

1245
01:16:33,311 --> 01:16:34,051
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1246
01:17:03,254 --> 01:17:04,575
[SPEAKER_13]: What were you saying?

1247
01:17:04,795 --> 01:17:06,656
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you call in to talk about before we derailed the call?

1248
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:21,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my first question, well, actually my only question to you guys is, now that most of the games have come out for this holiday season, with the exception of Mass Effect, which I actually, that's still due to be released before the holidays, before Christmas, right?

1249
01:17:21,425 --> 01:17:23,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Hasn't been delayed, there isn't anything new that I haven't heard about.

1250
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:24,147
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it comes out in a couple days.

1251
01:17:24,347 --> 01:17:25,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, almost here.

1252
01:17:25,928 --> 01:17:26,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.

1253
01:17:27,329 --> 01:17:32,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Where would you rank this holiday season compared to other big ones in video game history as far as quality of games go?

1254
01:17:33,155 --> 01:17:43,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say it's pretty far up there, but I think 1998 with Ocarina of Time and Metal Gear Solid was probably better, and 2001 with Halo, Melee, and what was the other big one?

1255
01:17:43,819 --> 01:17:45,120
[SPEAKER_08]: GTA 3 was probably better.

1256
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:56,524
[SPEAKER_08]: A big complaint about this year's games is that to me there's a lack of games that can be truly considered timeless, like a Metal Gear Solid where people will be coming back to it years later and playing it.

1257
01:17:57,124 --> 01:17:58,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Galaxy falls into that mold, but

1258
01:17:59,386 --> 01:18:00,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Bioshock is a first-person shooter.

1259
01:18:01,347 --> 01:18:04,668
[SPEAKER_08]: First-person shooters get tossed to the wayside like yesterday's dinner.

1260
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:07,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially with no multiplayer to keep people coming back.

1261
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:18,233
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I gotta say, here's the thing about this year's batch of games that I think does make it better than years past, and that is the fact that there's no new consoles this year.

1262
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,254
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing in the realm of new consoles.

1263
01:18:20,494 --> 01:18:24,035
[SPEAKER_13]: There's console redesigns, kind of, but there's no new consoles.

1264
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:27,116
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really the first year we don't even have a new handheld system.

1265
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:28,377
[SPEAKER_13]: It's wide open.

1266
01:18:29,157 --> 01:18:30,018
[SPEAKER_13]: as to what's out there.

1267
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:34,801
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, therefore, the consoles that are out in the marketplace have had a little more time to mature.

1268
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:43,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I don't feel PlayStation 3 has used the time to its best of ability, which kind of makes me think, honestly, PlayStation 3 should have just come out this year.

1269
01:18:44,547 --> 01:18:44,827
Probably.

1270
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,248
[SPEAKER_13]: But who am I?

1271
01:18:46,648 --> 01:18:49,469
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see why maybe they didn't do it, because they want to be out there or whatever.

1272
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:50,230
[SPEAKER_13]: But

1273
01:18:50,754 --> 01:19:01,896
[SPEAKER_13]: All that aside, you kind of see that now, okay, it's not so much the launch games, where you're getting into the second generation of games, and you could say even with 360, perhaps even starting to get into the third generation of games for the system.

1274
01:19:02,256 --> 01:19:04,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I think next year's going to be even better, honestly.

1275
01:19:05,057 --> 01:19:11,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And then probably the year after that is when you're going to start seeing stuff about the Xbox 720 or their next project, so you'll kind of start to die down.

1276
01:19:11,818 --> 01:19:18,239
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do think kind of like next year will be even better than this year for that reason, that the consoles will have had a little time to age.

1277
01:19:18,749 --> 01:19:20,309
[SPEAKER_13]: and I think that's the thing about, I think you cited 98.

1278
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:24,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was the time when like, you know, 64 had already been out.

1279
01:19:25,391 --> 01:19:27,032
[SPEAKER_13]: PlayStation had already been out a couple years.

1280
01:19:27,152 --> 01:19:32,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I think those, you know, systems kind of had their time to really get, you know, some of their best stuff.

1281
01:19:33,694 --> 01:19:35,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Like a fine wine, Jason says in chat.

1282
01:19:36,034 --> 01:19:36,495
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1283
01:19:37,975 --> 01:19:38,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1284
01:19:39,516 --> 01:19:46,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it'll be interesting to see how the PS3 brings it next year because Metal Gear Solid 4, hopefully, will be out by next holidays.

1285
01:19:46,858 --> 01:19:47,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh,

1286
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,933
[SPEAKER_08]: 360 really brought it to the table this year.

1287
01:19:50,613 --> 01:19:53,958
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 3 brought a few things with Heavenly Sword and...

1288
01:19:55,401 --> 01:19:56,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a couple of the other ports that came over from the 360.

1289
01:19:57,702 --> 01:20:00,604
[SPEAKER_13]: And hopefully next year they can just really keep it moving.

1290
01:20:00,684 --> 01:20:05,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully the developers don't jump ship because home looks really exciting.

1291
01:20:05,427 --> 01:20:07,989
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Final Fantasy XIII is going to have people drooling.

1292
01:20:08,649 --> 01:20:11,071
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a lot to look forward to from PlayStation 3.

1293
01:20:11,531 --> 01:20:13,953
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, it's been a very slow start.

1294
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:14,613
[SPEAKER_13]: But who knows?

1295
01:20:14,873 --> 01:20:15,654
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a real question.

1296
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:18,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Can developers get used to the PS3 and use it to its full potential, which...

1297
01:20:19,256 --> 01:20:21,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people seem to agree that it does have a lot of potential.

1298
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:26,379
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just really hard to develop for with the 8 trillion cores it has on there.

1299
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:27,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

1300
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:34,962
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting a message from DMM that says, 21 Xbox Live users have the OLR pick, according to whatever he found.

1301
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:36,943
[SPEAKER_13]: That's amazing.

1302
01:20:37,904 --> 01:20:41,245
[SPEAKER_13]: I would be thrilled if two people were using it, honestly, myself and Loki.

1303
01:20:41,885 --> 01:20:43,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Bobby is winning by...

1304
01:20:43,971 --> 01:20:44,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, Bobby.

1305
01:20:44,411 --> 01:20:44,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, Bobby.

1306
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:45,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's pretty cool.

1307
01:21:08,462 --> 01:21:08,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby has 381.

1308
01:21:09,203 --> 01:21:10,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Evil Avatar has 487.

1309
01:21:11,245 --> 01:21:15,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, see, Evil Avatar has a huge community behind them, so I believe that.

1310
01:21:16,249 --> 01:21:17,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you guys have 22.

1311
01:21:18,531 --> 01:21:18,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Rock!

1312
01:21:19,612 --> 01:21:23,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Bobby has, what, like 15 times the number of people using his picture than we do?

1313
01:21:23,676 --> 01:21:25,077
[SPEAKER_08]: AGI has 47.

1314
01:21:25,157 --> 01:21:27,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, they have 43.

1315
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:27,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I have 8.

1316
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:28,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo-hoo!

1317
01:21:28,741 --> 01:21:29,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo-hoo!

1318
01:21:29,782 --> 01:21:30,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

1319
01:21:30,502 --> 01:21:31,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Go meet in the Matrix.

1320
01:21:31,423 --> 01:21:32,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we need to...

1321
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:33,898
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to get the shows back.

1322
01:21:34,058 --> 01:21:34,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

1323
01:21:34,878 --> 01:21:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: We need people.

1324
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:37,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, people using Bobby pictures.

1325
01:21:37,219 --> 01:21:37,839
[SPEAKER_13]: He doesn't need it.

1326
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:41,680
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to switch over to the OLR pic or a T-Dig pic.

1327
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:42,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Bobby don't need the numbers no more.

1328
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:44,742
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kidding.

1329
01:21:45,062 --> 01:21:45,662
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's great.

1330
01:21:45,682 --> 01:21:46,522
[SPEAKER_08]: He's getting a lot of support.

1331
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:47,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Kudos to him.

1332
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:47,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1333
01:21:47,843 --> 01:21:49,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's great people are using him at all.

1334
01:21:50,424 --> 01:21:50,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

1335
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:54,865
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, Rob D., we've given you way more time than the other callers.

1336
01:21:54,885 --> 01:21:57,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got to let you go, but any quick final thoughts for our listeners?

1337
01:21:58,627 --> 01:21:58,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Game on.

1338
01:21:59,007 --> 01:22:01,988
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try to get T-Dig back, but unfortunately I can't make promises since I

1339
01:22:03,508 --> 01:22:07,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to work practically full-time in school, half-time, but you guys know the excuses.

1340
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:09,229
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have been through that before, I'm sure.

1341
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:10,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

1342
01:22:10,089 --> 01:22:10,390
[SPEAKER_08]: See you later.

1343
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:10,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

1344
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,810
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, take care, Rob.

1345
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:13,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck to you.

1346
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:17,031
[SPEAKER_13]: T-Dig was a good show, and he had a whole other guy that edited it, too.

1347
01:22:18,491 --> 01:22:19,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots of work that went into that show.

1348
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:21,512
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, maybe one more call.

1349
01:22:21,532 --> 01:22:25,193
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got time for one more call, then we'll jump into the afterbirth in our Rock Band post-show.

1350
01:22:26,473 --> 01:22:29,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I don't see the line ringing, but let's do some quick last-minute stories.

1351
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:30,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie, you have anything for last-minute stories?

1352
01:22:31,574 --> 01:22:32,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of Mountain Dew.

1353
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:35,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Almost.

1354
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:36,211
[SPEAKER_13]: I see a little more Mountain Dew in there.

1355
01:22:36,231 --> 01:22:36,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a little left.

1356
01:22:37,111 --> 01:22:38,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, all right, Loki.

1357
01:22:39,513 --> 01:22:43,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say Avatar, The Last Airbender, The Burning Earth.

1358
01:22:44,256 --> 01:22:52,301
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get all 1,000 achievement points in two minutes in that game by just backing up into a corner and hitting a button over and over and over again.

1359
01:22:52,502 --> 01:22:52,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazing.

1360
01:22:53,002 --> 01:22:53,742
[SPEAKER_13]: We got another call.

1361
01:22:53,762 --> 01:22:54,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

1362
01:22:54,723 --> 01:22:55,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1363
01:22:56,564 --> 01:22:57,425
[SPEAKER_13]: This is DMN.

1364
01:22:57,585 --> 01:22:58,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, DMN.

1365
01:22:58,606 --> 01:22:59,126
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

1366
01:23:01,082 --> 01:23:02,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a challenge for the three of you.

1367
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:03,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shit.

1368
01:23:04,745 --> 01:23:05,005
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

1369
01:23:05,586 --> 01:23:07,427
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't anything stupid.

1370
01:23:07,668 --> 01:23:08,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I promise.

1371
01:23:09,549 --> 01:23:10,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about that.

1372
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:17,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I challenge the three of you to convince myself and everyone listening that Dance Dance Revolution is not dead.

1373
01:23:18,136 --> 01:23:18,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Go.

1374
01:23:19,717 --> 01:23:20,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Is what?

1375
01:23:20,518 --> 01:23:22,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Dance Dance Revolution is not dead.

1376
01:23:24,241 --> 01:23:26,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw people playing it the other day at the pizza place.

1377
01:23:28,324 --> 01:23:28,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is.

1378
01:23:29,363 --> 01:23:31,684
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll agree with you because I picked up Supernova 2

1379
01:23:55,737 --> 01:23:59,978
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's arguably the worst musically Dance Dance Revolution game I've ever played in my life.

1380
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:04,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting because not a lot of people necessarily felt the same way.

1381
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:13,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think necessarily it was received that poorly by the community but I don't think people make such a big deal out of these releases anymore.

1382
01:24:13,021 --> 01:24:16,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Universe 2 is coming out soon and it's kind of being met with this big hmm.

1383
01:24:17,543 --> 01:24:18,143
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is it.

1384
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:18,383
[SPEAKER_13]: It's

1385
01:24:19,815 --> 01:24:21,577
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR is back and it's alive again!

1386
01:24:44,196 --> 01:24:54,584
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why I always praised the Ultramix series on this show previously is that like three quarters of the innovative shit you saw on the console games were all coming from the Xbox series.

1387
01:24:55,045 --> 01:25:01,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Things like quest mode, things like song lists reaching out into independent music scene, you know, all that stuff.

1388
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:03,832
[SPEAKER_13]: That was all innovated by the Xbox team.

1389
01:25:04,612 --> 01:25:05,113
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why that...

1390
01:25:06,551 --> 01:25:19,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Those types of innovations, at least even when they fail, because not everything is done very well, like the quest mode in Universe was god-awful, but I give them props for at least trying to innovate a dead game.

1391
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:25,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and then the other thing too is that they keep making so many damn games for it.

1392
01:25:25,363 --> 01:25:30,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, if anybody's to blame for killing the series, it's Konami.

1393
01:25:30,827 --> 01:25:31,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because...

1394
01:25:31,834 --> 01:25:32,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's see.

1395
01:25:32,454 --> 01:25:40,896
[SPEAKER_11]: This year alone, we had DDR Universe come out, DDR Supernova 2, DDR Hottest Party, and we're going to have DDR Universe 2 coming out.

1396
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:46,598
[SPEAKER_11]: And then next year already, I can think of at least two more games that are coming out in the DDR series.

1397
01:25:47,318 --> 01:25:53,259
[SPEAKER_11]: One of which is the never-talked-about DDR Disney Mix, or DDR Disney Channel.

1398
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:55,640
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's crap like that.

1399
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:58,380
[SPEAKER_11]: It's watering this shit down, and it's not really innovative.

1400
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,841
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, let's throw some more songs in there, and that's it.

1401
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:04,318
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, they still sell very well.

1402
01:26:04,378 --> 01:26:05,718
[SPEAKER_11]: We always sell out of them.

1403
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:16,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, if you look in the past, you know, recent, well, I don't know about the recent charts, but I know that DDR Extreme 2 was on the top of charts for a long time, or at least Supernova was.

1404
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:18,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And Supernova 2's not doing bad at all.

1405
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:22,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, probably their expectations are lower, but

1406
01:26:22,908 --> 01:26:30,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of it is Hottest Party Yay, use the remote nunchuck That was crap Universe 2

1407
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:34,775
[SPEAKER_11]: is going to be, you know, not much more innovative.

1408
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:35,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, great.

1409
01:26:35,736 --> 01:26:37,196
[SPEAKER_11]: They brought freestyle mode back.

1410
01:26:37,236 --> 01:26:38,917
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a game where you don't have arrows.

1411
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:40,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking awesome.

1412
01:26:40,758 --> 01:26:41,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing.

1413
01:26:41,618 --> 01:26:45,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Konami, one of my favorite game companies ever.

1414
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I've known people that have worked there.

1415
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,101
[SPEAKER_13]: I have great relationships with a lot of the folks that work there.

1416
01:26:49,601 --> 01:26:50,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing.

1417
01:26:50,842 --> 01:26:55,624
[SPEAKER_13]: My honest, like, friendly advice to the folks at Konami, take a page from Harmonix.

1418
01:26:56,576 --> 01:27:23,836
[SPEAKER_13]: because look at what Harmonix did is that basically they were given the challenge of oh look Guitar Hero got taken away from you but we want to make we want to have you make kind of the same thing and they like took what essentially was kind of the same fucking game and just really ran away with it and with this rock band and kind of made something completely new out of it and this whole like you can print your band's t-shirt like this is all like crazy stuff like running away with innovative ideas I think honestly DDR

1419
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:27,139
[SPEAKER_13]: might want to hire a consultant from Harmonix.

1420
01:27:29,101 --> 01:27:30,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, what do you think?

1421
01:27:31,022 --> 01:27:36,387
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say, you're talking about Universe, I think Musical Universe is actually one of the best DDR mixes I've ever played.

1422
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:49,758
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a great variety of music, some things that were poppy that I could actually stand, because anybody who knows me, and I don't know if many people know me that personally, I do not like pop music at all.

1423
01:27:51,079 --> 01:27:51,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1424
01:27:53,169 --> 01:27:59,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Going from Slam to 8-Bit to Don't Play Nice, which is a song I actually enjoyed, was a lot of fun.

1425
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:02,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

1426
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:04,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Universe has an excellent song list.

1427
01:28:04,678 --> 01:28:05,679
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's really what D.D.

1428
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:06,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Abrams went on to.

1429
01:28:06,619 --> 01:28:11,343
[SPEAKER_10]: The standard list from Supernova 2, without unlocking anything, was just a disappointment.

1430
01:28:11,643 --> 01:28:14,125
[SPEAKER_10]: There was one song I was like, huh, this is awesome.

1431
01:28:14,566 --> 01:28:17,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, wait, two, because I didn't know one song and there was my gold press.

1432
01:28:17,868 --> 01:28:18,549
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a good song.

1433
01:28:19,271 --> 01:28:21,852
[SPEAKER_10]: But Rockefeller's Gang was the only song I'm like, huh, this is a good song.

1434
01:28:21,892 --> 01:28:23,472
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, everything else didn't really stand out.

1435
01:28:25,713 --> 01:28:27,193
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a bit of a disappointment.

1436
01:28:28,214 --> 01:28:31,955
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I paid nothing for it, so I shouldn't complain too much.

1437
01:28:32,735 --> 01:28:37,996
[SPEAKER_13]: I stand by that I firmly believe that the best home mix to come out in the U.S.

1438
01:28:38,176 --> 01:28:44,978
[SPEAKER_13]: or Japan anywhere, anytime, and probably will always be the best DDR game that comes out on the home consoles is Ultramix 2 on the Xbox.

1439
01:28:45,298 --> 01:28:47,459
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why is because that is where...

1440
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:49,219
[SPEAKER_13]: They took the most risk.

1441
01:28:49,479 --> 01:28:55,261
[SPEAKER_13]: They completely changed the people that did the steps to people that really knew the game of DDR inside and out.

1442
01:28:55,561 --> 01:28:59,242
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where they took some big risks with the song list that paid off in a huge way.

1443
01:28:59,662 --> 01:29:12,725
[SPEAKER_13]: It's where they added these new modes that changed the game and had that Xbox Live dancing that was kind of explored in the first Ultramix game but totally improved on with the different types of versus modes in the second game.

1444
01:29:13,665 --> 01:29:16,626
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there will ever be a DDR game as good as Ultramix 2, period.

1445
01:29:17,631 --> 01:29:21,892
[SPEAKER_13]: that makes me feel as excited about DDR as I did when I first played Ultramix 2.

1446
01:29:22,912 --> 01:29:25,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, we've got to let you go.

1447
01:29:25,353 --> 01:29:27,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Our time's about up, but thanks for the call, DMN.

1448
01:29:28,014 --> 01:29:28,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1449
01:29:28,894 --> 01:29:29,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

1450
01:29:29,834 --> 01:29:31,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Were we able to meet your challenge somehow?

1451
01:29:33,195 --> 01:29:38,396
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was a good discussion, and I actually wanted to call in and not be a bumbling idiot for once.

1452
01:29:39,036 --> 01:29:39,956
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate that.

1453
01:29:41,117 --> 01:29:42,857
[SPEAKER_04]: We like it when you're not a bumbling idiot.

1454
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:46,238
[SPEAKER_13]: If they want to hear you being a bumbling idiot, they should just download OL Revolution.

1455
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:53,043
[SPEAKER_10]: They listen to Jamie saying your name over and over in a song.

1456
01:29:53,063 --> 01:29:54,203
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nothing wrong with that.

1457
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:59,244
[SPEAKER_13]: But you and Drunk Drunk Revolution, seriously, WTF.

1458
01:30:00,225 --> 01:30:02,085
[SPEAKER_13]: OMG, WTF, BBQ, LOL.

1459
01:30:02,485 --> 01:30:03,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, bye DMN.

1460
01:30:04,946 --> 01:30:06,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that's it for the Skype line today.

1461
01:30:06,847 --> 01:30:07,827
[SPEAKER_13]: We gotta close it up.

1462
01:30:08,926 --> 01:30:10,187
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1463
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:32,030
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com.

1464
01:30:54,445 --> 01:30:57,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is for anyone who is waiting for Unreal Tournament 3 on Xbox 360.

1465
01:30:57,988 --> 01:31:02,791
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually said that it works already and has worked since last spring.

1466
01:31:03,871 --> 01:31:09,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And that they've actually put on hold any further development on it because of getting it to work on Xbox Live.

1467
01:31:09,775 --> 01:31:12,637
[SPEAKER_13]: But what about that whole, like, it's supposed to be out on PlayStation 3 first for like a week though, right?

1468
01:31:12,657 --> 01:31:14,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It is going to be out on Windows and PlayStation 3 first.

1469
01:31:15,259 --> 01:31:21,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they're taking Christmas off and are going to start working on the Xbox 360 version so that they can get it to work with mods and everything.

1470
01:31:22,732 --> 01:31:28,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where the delay is, but it works, and it has been working, and it could be done by now, but no.

1471
01:31:29,037 --> 01:31:29,738
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's that deal.

1472
01:31:29,998 --> 01:31:33,781
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's the deal, and there's also the fact that they're trying to get it to work on live.

1473
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:35,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Loki.

1474
01:31:35,803 --> 01:31:47,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, Microsoft is doing an offer, which is less cool now because originally we thought it was for everybody, but apparently if you own an original Xbox and you have a paid Xbox Live account...

1475
01:31:48,371 --> 01:31:56,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you purchase an Xbox 360 between November 21st and December 21st of this year, you'll be entitled to a free copy of Halo 3.

1476
01:31:57,813 --> 01:32:02,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So you fill out some sort of form and you get a copy mailed to you.

1477
01:32:03,135 --> 01:32:03,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray!

1478
01:32:05,455 --> 01:32:05,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Postal 3.

1479
01:32:06,616 --> 01:32:09,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently Uebol is in the game and you can kill him.

1480
01:32:10,277 --> 01:32:10,697
[SPEAKER_11]: In the game.

1481
01:32:11,577 --> 01:32:11,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

1482
01:32:13,619 --> 01:32:41,820
[SPEAKER_11]: and then the Wii Zapper apparently there is of course some pictures that floated on the internet with some unboxing of that and there is a second configuration which also begs the question why the fuck do you actually need this then where you take the nunchuck basically out of the Wii Zapper and you just hold the Zapper with the remote in there like you would hold the remote normally so it's a piece of plastic that's completely useless

1483
01:32:42,657 --> 01:32:43,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooray!

1484
01:32:44,858 --> 01:32:45,859
[SPEAKER_11]: But we will soon see.

1485
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I use the Wii Zapper on a Wii Bowl?

1486
01:32:50,122 --> 01:32:52,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe if they put out Postal 3 on the Wii.

1487
01:32:52,924 --> 01:32:54,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you played Manhunt 2 on the Wii yet?

1488
01:32:54,905 --> 01:32:56,206
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I really don't care.

1489
01:32:56,226 --> 01:32:58,888
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just the PSP, huh?

1490
01:32:58,968 --> 01:33:01,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was all excited to get it originally when it was adult only.

1491
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:04,792
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I'm just like, eh, whatever.

1492
01:33:04,932 --> 01:33:06,393
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just not as controversial anymore.

1493
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:07,954
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll play No More Heroes.

1494
01:33:07,974 --> 01:33:08,774
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be pretty cool.

1495
01:33:09,034 --> 01:33:10,956
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, Manhunt 2, I don't care.

1496
01:33:11,396 --> 01:33:11,576
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1497
01:33:12,393 --> 01:33:13,534
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1498
01:33:13,574 --> 01:33:14,034
[SPEAKER_13]: I want pie.

1499
01:33:14,054 --> 01:33:15,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, my final thought is I'm going to steal DarkSakura's iPhone.

1500
01:33:15,635 --> 01:33:16,055
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, it's mine.

1501
01:33:16,075 --> 01:33:16,636
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also want pie.

1502
01:33:16,656 --> 01:33:16,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

1503
01:33:16,756 --> 01:33:19,457
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is I need to take some more extra strength Tylenol.

1504
01:33:19,478 --> 01:33:21,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay, sorry to hear about your headache.

1505
01:33:40,396 --> 01:33:41,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's it for this week.

1506
01:33:41,977 --> 01:33:43,879
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, have a good two weeks off.

1507
01:33:43,939 --> 01:33:44,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Have fun in Alabama.

1508
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:45,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

1509
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I will call you on Sunday.

1510
01:33:47,842 --> 01:33:48,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds good.

1511
01:33:48,463 --> 01:33:53,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I think originally we were going to take a week off, but I haven't heard that chatter, so I don't think we are going to do that.

1512
01:33:53,467 --> 01:33:54,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we are going to be live the next two weeks.

1513
01:33:54,928 --> 01:33:56,810
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be here doing our thang.

1514
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be possible I'll be here the week after, but I might just be dead.

1515
01:34:00,231 --> 01:34:02,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, no, if you need the night off, go for it.

1516
01:34:02,933 --> 01:34:09,495
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll find some of our local favorites to help fill in, and possibly the wheat zapper challenge happens.

1517
01:34:09,656 --> 01:34:23,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But if any of our, I'm actually going to be hopefully meeting up with a friend of mine back there who I met again through DDR, who I met while I lived out here, and then, so I think it's kind of funny.

1518
01:34:24,302 --> 01:34:24,362
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

1519
01:34:24,973 --> 01:34:27,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppies already volunteering to fill in for a night when you're not here.

1520
01:34:27,616 --> 01:34:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, puppy.

1521
01:34:29,138 --> 01:34:30,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And send me some chocolate.

1522
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:32,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Will you allow puppy to sit in the fluffy blue chair?

1523
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:34,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy can sit in the fluffy blue chair.

1524
01:34:35,065 --> 01:34:35,345
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1525
01:34:35,765 --> 01:34:39,489
[SPEAKER_13]: It used to be the big green chair, the big green monster chair, but now it's the fluffy blue chair.

1526
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:41,031
[SPEAKER_13]: It's lightweight and fluffy.

1527
01:34:41,472 --> 01:34:41,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

1528
01:34:42,967 --> 01:34:43,788
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it, folks.

1529
01:34:43,948 --> 01:34:45,849
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to play the outro and get on out of here.

1530
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:49,251
