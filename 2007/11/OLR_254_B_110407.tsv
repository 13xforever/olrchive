0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	24000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this part B of our podcast.
24000	29000	We're live here on Sunday evening taping and some housekeeping items I've neglected to mention.
29000	31000	In part A of tonight's show.
31000	35000	I actually did a guest stint on another show this week so you should check that out.
35000	38000	It's called Ultimate Quest is the show.
38000	42000	And you've probably heard Footy Monster, maybe Xenocore call in this show.
42000	46000	Well they are hosts on another show over at All Games and it's called Ultimate Quest.
46000	48000	And that show should be out this week.
48000	52000	I think they said Monday night or Tuesday afternoon-ish so check them out at UltimateQuest.net.
52000	54000	We had a conversation about MMOs.
54000	59000	And you know I was kind of like the guy there that played WoW and Final Fantasy XI.
59000	64000	But it was a good panel because they had another guy that was like City of Heroes and a couple were playing Eve Online.
64000	67000	And you know lots of different MMOs being talked about.
67000	70000	We were kind of talking about societies and getting into a pretty in-depth discussion.
70000	72000	Good times, I approve.
72000	75000	So thanks to the kids at Ultimate Quest for having me on their program.
75000	77000	Now we can get back into some gaming news.
77000	83000	Alright, so Super Mario Galaxy of course is coming out not next week but the week after next.
83000	90000	And you know it's been revealed that there's going to be a certain hidden playable character in the game.
90000	98000	Apparently when you secure all 120 stars in the game, complete all the purple coin missions,
98000	104000	defeated Bowser a second time, you can play as Luigi.
104000	109000	And actually Luigi, he will jump higher and further, also runs faster but has trouble stopping.
109000	116000	And says otherwise they have the same moves but it actually makes the game a little bit harder.
116000	121000	That's kind of cool. That's just like Luigi in the Lost Levels or Super Mario Bros. 2 Japanese, however you want to call it.
121000	124000	Luigi jumped higher but he was harder to control.
124000	128000	He was like constantly on ice basically. Luigi on ice.
128000	130000	Luigi needs no sneakers.
130000	132000	Not just a palette swap.
132000	135000	At least it's not, you know, Luigi's Mansion.
135000	141000	Yeah that would be, I'm glad it's not Luigi's Mansion embedded in the game.
141000	145000	Although I don't know, part of me thinks Luigi's Mansion got a bad rap. I don't know.
145000	149000	I actually liked Luigi's Mansion until it got to the baby part and then the baby part kind of creeped me out.
149000	152000	Really? Well I thought you liked scary video games though.
152000	159000	There's a difference between stupid scary and like, I like Silent Hill and I like Resident Evil.
159000	161000	Mental screwing with your mind scary.
161000	169000	Well thanks to the ESRB ratings some new games have been leaked for upcoming US Virtual Console releases.
169000	174000	Alien Soldier is one of the games that is going to be coming to Virtual Console soon.
174000	179000	As well as Shining Force 2 and Bubble Bobble will be coming to Virtual Console.
179000	187000	And it is assumed that they have worked it out so that you can get past level 30 in the Virtual Console release of Bubble Bobble.
187000	190000	That's kind of a dated joke now. I wonder if people get that.
190000	194000	And apparently some late breaking news because we do tape live on Sunday nights.
194000	197000	Apparently some websites. Who put this, Go Nintendo?
197000	204000	Go Nintendo had a video or I should say a voice mail from Mario himself.
204000	205000	Charles Martinet.
205000	211000	Yes. Announcing Super Mario Bros. 3 will be out tomorrow.
211000	213000	I love Super Mario Bros. 3.
213000	216000	Mario 3 is fucking rad. I love playing through Mario 3 and not using warp zones.
216000	219000	Because I love Giant World. Who doesn't love Giant World?
219000	223000	Giant World is the best, but you know what? My favorite is going in Kuriboh's shoe.
223000	226000	There's only like one level in the whole game where you do that, huh?
226000	227000	It's not even a mandatory level, is it?
227000	232000	But with the Game Boy, with the Game Genie code back in the day, you could keep the shoe through other levels.
232000	233000	Awesome.
233000	236000	Which sort of made it stupid for the ones you have to fly to get to shit though.
236000	241000	Now all you need is to actually be able to play this game online.
241000	246000	Like imagine if you could be Mario and play against a Luigi that's millions of miles away.
246000	247000	You know that's not going to happen.
247000	250000	Fun. It should.
250000	252000	But will it?
252000	253000	I don't know.
253000	258000	Anyway, for UK Virtual Console, we've got some fun stuff.
258000	264000	Sonic 3D Flickies Island for 800 Wii points will be out.
264000	270000	The Sonic 3D games were sort of interesting.
270000	275000	They weren't really 3D, just sort of 3D. But anyway.
275000	277000	I can't believe it's not 3D.
277000	280000	Yeah, I can't believe it's not 3D, exactly.
280000	289000	And then we also have, as soon as it loads, Samurai Ghost, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game.
289000	297000	Which is a side-scrolling, you know, slash fighter shooter, you know, guy with a sword game.
297000	307000	And I think it's funny, the whole purpose of the game, according to the opening screen, is it's an order from the King of Heaven.
307000	311000	And then we have Art of Fighting, Neo Geo.
311000	316000	And I don't need to say anything more about Art of Fighting, because that's the game that gave us...
316000	317000	King.
317000	324000	No. Well, besides King, it gave us the two characters that spawned the introduction of Dan Hibiki in the Street Fighter series.
324000	328000	Which would be Ryo and Robert Garcia.
328000	330000	Was Dan supposed to be like a parody of them or something?
330000	331000	Yes, he was.
331000	332000	How funny.
332000	335000	Because Ryo was like a Ryu knock-off.
335000	346000	And Robert Garcia had, I guess, he had some other moves, so they actually combined the two characters into, you know, Mr. Sucktastic Godoken.
346000	347000	So I thought it was great.
347000	356000	And again, keep in mind, Dan's like one of my favorite characters, especially in Puzzle Fighter, because you have to be really freaking good to beat people in Puzzle Fighter using Dan.
356000	358000	Because he drops all red blocks.
358000	360000	So you have to drop a lot really fast.
360000	365000	Yeah, you have to be really good, and I can proudly say that I've beaten somebody using Devilot.
365000	369000	Or pray that a red, uh, a red break gem never falls.
369000	370000	Seriously.
370000	374000	But, you know, I digress.
374000	376000	Which is the whole point of the show, digression.
376000	382000	Awesome.
382000	389000	Anyways, so, you know, we don't really talk too much about Atari.
389000	393000	Well, they don't give us a lot that's worth talking about anymore.
393000	399000	In case you haven't heard, Atari, they have not too many licensed games out there.
399000	403000	I mean, I think the last few licensed games haven't been that great.
403000	408000	You know, what with the, um, they used to have the Driver series.
408000	411000	Of course, they lost the Driver series.
411000	420000	And now they're battling to retain the Dragon Ball Z license, because pretty much the only big game that they release every year is the Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi game.
420000	422000	And now that might not be the case.
422000	428000	Just one? I thought every year they would release over 9000 of these games.
428000	433000	They may sell only over 9000, but no, I don't know.
433000	440000	It's kind of sad to see, because really all that they're going to be left after this is gone is pretty much alone in the dark.
440000	443000	You know what?
443000	446000	This is what I have to say, first of all, two things.
446000	448000	One about Dragon Ball Z and one about Atari.
448000	452000	Dragon Ball Z has been off the air in Japan when I graduated college.
452000	456000	Well, I didn't graduate college, but when I was out of high school.
456000	459000	No, I take that back because I had an episode taped off the TV.
459000	463000	Okay, the series ended in the mid-90s.
463000	466000	We are now in the late 2000s.
466000	469000	It's old. Drop it.
469000	471000	Well, they have Dragon Ball GT now.
471000	473000	It's Drag on Ball.
473000	478000	No, Dragon Ball GT has been over and done with for years.
478000	481000	Just find something.
481000	485000	Well, no, now we're getting Bleach, and Bleach is the new Dragon Ball.
485000	490000	But we're in the United States, not Japan.
490000	493000	But it still doesn't mean it's not even old over here.
493000	495000	It's still old.
495000	497000	You know, the whole thing is saturated.
497000	500000	And that and Atari, oh my God.
500000	503000	ActDef says in our chatroom, chat.orangetonsharing.com, ActDef says,
503000	506000	Atari, doing nothing since the 1980s.
506000	511000	And to tell Ranma, Dragon Ball GT, in my opinion, does kind of count,
511000	516000	because it was going back to the original, you know, flair of what Dragon Ball was.
516000	519000	But Dragon Ball Z was better.
519000	522000	Okay, I would like to make a point here real quick.
522000	525000	This is how bad this is going to be for Atari.
525000	526000	Okay, let me put it this way.
526000	528000	This is their big games for the fourth quarter.
528000	532000	You have Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkai G3, okay.
532000	540000	Godzilla Unleashed, which is a Godzilla fighting game on PlayStation 2, the Wii, and the DS.
540000	547000	I kid you not, I kid you not, Jenga on the Wii and the DS.
547000	550000	I remember reporting on this game when it was first announced.
550000	554000	We were like, the fuck? Can't you just play, like, real Jenga?
554000	556000	Which I believe they did at the Penny Arcade Expo.
556000	558000	They played real Jenga.
558000	563000	And to be honest, then they also have another, like, classic compilation game coming through the PSP.
563000	566000	Because that's all that ever comes out of the PSP.
566000	567000	That's it.
567000	569000	That's all they have coming out of this here.
569000	574000	Alone in the Dark, whatever it is, Fie, or Alone in the Dark, New Alone in the Dark.
574000	578000	Alone in the Dark, Tim Curry's voice isn't in this game, so don't buy it.
578000	579000	Basically, right?
579000	582000	Okay, I have to make a correction and I have to do this by timeline.
582000	585000	Oh, you know, I got Alone in the Dark mixed up with Gabriel...
585000	586000	Never mind, forget it.
586000	587000	Gabriel Knight?
587000	588000	Yeah, forget it.
588000	589000	Okay.
589000	591000	Dragon Ball Z was replaced by Rurouni Kenshin.
591000	593000	Rurouni Kenshin was replaced by Naruto.
593000	595000	And now Bleach is doing its damnedest.
595000	597000	So that's the transition I'd like to point out.
597000	600000	Seriously, companies, stop making so many Naruto games.
600000	602000	I mean, there's, like, five every year.
602000	604000	Seriously, we don't need that many Naruto games.
604000	608000	I think I have, like, a stack of them in our vault collecting dust.
609000	610000	In the vault.
611000	613000	No, it really is the vault.
613000	615000	It's a whole room dedicated to my video game collection.
615000	616000	Alright.
616000	622000	Well, anyhow, you know, they say imitation is the finest form of flattery, but...
622000	630000	I don't know about this one, because apparently, there is now a... Walmart is now selling these little knockoff Wiimotes.
630000	633000	It's a device made by Toy Quest.
633000	640000	And what it is, it basically looks like a Wiimote, but it has a little LCD screen on the Wiimote.
642000	646000	And you actually play tennis with this Wiimote.
646000	652000	It's a little tiny LCD screen, but I don't even think it has motion control or whatever.
652000	654000	Because the screen is so fucking tiny.
654000	655000	It would be hilarious if it did.
655000	656000	If you swung it, how would you see it?
656000	658000	I'll swing it, and then, oh shit.
658000	662000	You know what? Someone needs to hack it to be a VMU emulator.
662000	664000	And put a chow on there.
664000	666000	Seriously, these things cost under $20.
666000	669000	I want to say it said it was, like, $7 for this thing.
669000	671000	And that might be too much for this.
671000	673000	So, I don't know about that.
673000	676000	But, yeah, if you want to...
676000	677000	Quality.
677000	680000	Let's say, like, you know, it might be a really cruel joke to play on someone.
680000	684000	Let's say you have this annoying little cousin that wants a Wii for Christmas.
684000	689000	You could get them this, and say, well, you know, Santa gave all the Wiis to the good kids.
689000	693000	Somebody had this left over for you to give to you.
693000	699000	Yeah, people should give, like, crappy useless toys to the bad children instead of coal.
699000	702000	Because you can actually use coal.
702000	705000	This is what you get for being a bad kid.
705000	711000	Is that like, you know, driving kids by a burned-out factory, telling them that Disneyland burned down or something?
711000	712000	No, that was deep thoughts.
712000	713000	I know that was deep thoughts.
713000	715000	With Jack Handy.
716000	719000	Anyhow, so yeah, those are kind of stupid.
719000	721000	And you know what?
721000	728000	These types of things, and these knock-offs, and these unoriginal bastards, and tiny little LCD screens that try to pass for a game.
728000	731000	These things just piss us off, and it makes us angsty.
731000	733000	And when we get mad, people die.
733000	736000	Or at least the FUs of the week are unleashed.
753000	758000	FU goes towards the digestion problems I inherited from my mother.
758000	761000	Mom, fuck your jeans.
761000	763000	I mean, I love you.
763000	767000	And her birthday tomorrow, so happy birthday to my mom, who will be 48.
767000	769000	Happy birthday, Jamie's mom.
769000	777000	But anyway, yeah, everything I eat really makes me sick, so I'm just gonna stop eating altogether.
777000	780000	Except for couscous.
780000	785000	I'm gonna be living on a solid diet of couscous and wonton soup.
785000	788000	Because those are two things that don't make me sick.
815000	817000	You can change what you look like.
817000	819000	Online multiplayer, you can change what you look like.
819000	822000	Put system link for some reason, and they're just like, ah, fuck it.
822000	824000	So, fuck them.
824000	829000	I continued FU to the bruise on my leg that still kind of hurts this week, but at least it's getting a little better.
829000	832000	Maybe I can roll my pants up far enough I can show you one.
832000	835000	Actually, I probably can't. My bruise is in here. I can't roll my pants up that far.
835000	839000	I might be a little too much skin for operator 11, so no show for you.
839000	840000	I was gonna say one more thing real quick.
840000	841000	What?
841000	845000	I tried to perform a level 3 execution on my wife's leg.
845000	847000	You know, Manhunt 2 reference.
847000	850000	She attacked her leg with her back claw, and it sliced it.
850000	853000	It looked like she was trying to cut her leg off or something.
853000	854000	What a kitty.
854000	855000	But, you know, without...
855000	859000	It was the cutest level 3 execution ever.
859000	862000	That's it. My FU just went to my bruise on my leg.
862000	864000	So, at least I don't have to have the Band-Aid on it anymore.
864000	866000	Puppy!
866000	873000	My FU goes to your neighborhood for there being no street lights and street signs covered by trees.
873000	878000	Because I almost got lost getting here because I couldn't read anything.
878000	883000	Yeah, I followed him all the way from the big main road over, and I was like,
883000	888000	Hey, I bet that's Puppy, because I saw the college sticker on your car.
888000	891000	And then I was like, he went right past Rob Street.
891000	893000	I almost went right past Rob Street.
893000	896000	It is kind of, yeah, they don't really have street lights here.
896000	898000	They didn't invent them yet, I guess, when these houses were built. What can I say?
898000	899000	It's rural.
899000	904000	And FU to the housing market, because I got scared a little bit.
904000	909000	And when half the people that I work with at my company got laid off this week.
909000	911000	No!
911000	917000	Well, I do drafting work for a carpenter.
917000	921000	And they just laid off a bunch of their foremen.
921000	923000	I hope I get laid off.
923000	930000	No, seriously, because if I get laid off, I get like three months of severance pay and collect unemployment while I start my massage business.
930000	932000	That'd be fantastic.
932000	933000	Awesome.
933000	935000	That would be nice.
935000	937000	Nice little cushion.
937000	941000	Alright, well that's going to do it for our FUs of the week.
941000	944000	Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
944000	945000	Shall we?
945000	946000	We shall.
946000	947000	We shall.
947000	949000	Dark Soccer, why don't you take it away?
949000	950000	I don't wanna.
950000	951000	You gotta.
951000	952000	Why?
952000	953000	Because I said so.
953000	955000	Okay, fine.
955000	964000	For anyone who follows the Child's Play charity, the 5th annual Child's Play charity drive is beginning.
964000	974000	Basically, the whole charity was the brainchild of the Penny Arcade powers that be.
974000	980000	And is now, you know, basically the gaming community's way of giving to those in need.
980000	985000	You know, for children who are in hospitals in 25 states and 5 countries.
985000	993000	So you can make your, you can donate your items through Amazon and it is considered a tax-deductible gift.
993000	996000	So keep that in mind if you have those deductions coming up.
996000	1006000	The drive, sorry, is, their fundraiser dinner, I apologize, is set to take place on December 11th at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.
1006000	1008000	So go play.
1008000	1010000	Get the brainstorming, folks.
1010000	1015000	We need to think of what we here at OLR can do to help out this lovely charity that gives gamers a good name.
1015000	1019000	So we'll have to think of something we can donate or a fundraiser we can do.
1019000	1021000	Maybe we'll have a ditter-thon, a DDR-thon.
1021000	1023000	Wouldn't that be fun?
1023000	1025000	Okay, maybe not.
1025000	1026000	You never know.
1026000	1027000	You never know.
1027000	1028000	We'll think of something.
1028000	1034000	So one awesome game that's coming out this year has gone gold and that would be Crysis.
1034000	1039000	It's due out November 16th so I hope you have your new PC by now because you're going to need it.
1039000	1044000	And of course it will be the first game to utilize the CryEngine 2.
1044000	1047000	No, that's not the same engine used in Yaris.
1047000	1049000	That's a different CryEngine.
1049000	1053000	And of course, hopefully it will be coming to the console soon.
1053000	1059000	There is a single player demo that's available now which hackers have gone ahead
1059000	1066000	and poked their noses through some of the DirectX workaround codes inside there.
1066000	1072000	And they've found stuff like hidden weapons, vehicles, and bad guys from the full version.
1072000	1078000	So now with a little bit of cutting and pasting they're able to play with every gun in the game
1078000	1082000	as well as tanks and attack chopper.
1082000	1083000	Sounds like how I play games.
1083000	1084000	Yeah, it does.
1084000	1090000	All the guns and tank and attack chopper right next to me in Cooking Mama.
1090000	1092000	Awesome.
1092000	1095000	Well this might be a game that Loki is going to want to hack too.
1095000	1096000	I don't know.
1096000	1102000	But this is the American McGee version of Grimm and it's coming to GameTap.
1102000	1107000	I actually did play a little bit of GameTap this week so I actually saw this ad.
1107000	1113000	They're actually going to be releasing a 24 episode series of this.
1113000	1116000	So it's kind of like think Sam and Max but like really, really long.
1116000	1121000	It's going to start in 2008 in the spring and they're already running the ads on it.
1121000	1123000	And the little quote from the ad says,
1123000	1128000	This spring American McGee thrust you into an incredible adventure built around the world's best known fairy tales.
1128000	1133000	Meet Snow White, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, and more of your favorites in 24 game episodes.
1133000	1139000	And of course American McGee did that Alice in Wonderland game that was pretty fucked.
1139000	1143000	So I'm sure you're going to see lots of your fairy tales done the right way.
1143000	1147000	Dark and gory the way they were originally.
1147000	1150000	I will be looking forward to, I imagine this is going to have to be in it,
1150000	1154000	The Hansel and Gretel because I can't wait to push the witch in the oven.
1154000	1156000	That'll be fun.
1156000	1159000	The original fairy tales were all kinds of messed up.
1159000	1161000	I mean who would read that to their children?
1161000	1164000	I would.
1164000	1168000	My mom handed me the book and said go read it and don't come bother me until you finish this chapter.
1168000	1175000	I would like to see the grim fairy tales done by Sam and Max because I think that would be awesome.
1175000	1178000	That would be kind of fun.
1178000	1179000	Anyways.
1179000	1184000	Sony is going to be doing an animated Resident Evil movie.
1184000	1187000	It's actually a CG animation.
1187000	1192000	They're calling it Biohazard Degeneration in Japan.
1192000	1198000	There's a presumption that it's going to be called Resident Evil Finding Necro over here.
1198000	1200000	Which is kind of a dumb name.
1200000	1205000	They said it's going to have groundbreaking visual effects and a brand new storyline.
1205000	1206000	So.
1206000	1207000	Oh well.
1207000	1209000	We'll see.
1209000	1210000	It's supposed to be out in 2008.
1210000	1211000	Nah, we won't see.
1211000	1213000	I don't really want to see it.
1213000	1217000	I mean I'm kind of over Resident Evil like 10 years ago.
1217000	1220000	I liked the last movie.
1220000	1227000	If you're over Resident Evil, perhaps you may be interested in a few other films that are coming.
1227000	1232000	Including Onimusha which is starting production in April.
1232000	1239000	Apparently they also have a poster now revealed for the Tekken movie.
1239000	1241000	Which the poster looks stupid.
1241000	1245000	I might add, it's a giant T that looks like it's being held up.
1245000	1246000	T for Tekken!
1246000	1247000	Wow!
1247000	1248000	It's creative.
1248000	1249000	Yay!
1249000	1254000	It's already down the road of DOA.
1254000	1262000	It's apparently the Onimusha adaption is expected to begin in April of 2008.
1262000	1266000	And of course Silent Hill director Christopher Gons is going to be at the helm.
1266000	1269000	Well that may not suck.
1269000	1270000	May not.
1270000	1271000	May not.
1271000	1272000	May not.
1272000	1279000	And unfortunately the Tekken poster, if I were to sum up the movie based on the poster,
1279000	1282000	I would say suck.
1282000	1286000	And based on the poster I'd be all, where's Big Bird?
1286000	1294000	To tell me, this episode was brought to you by the letter T and the number 69.
1294000	1297000	And how many times have fighting games made good movies?
1297000	1302000	Hey, I remember the Tekken anime that came out.
1302000	1305000	Well, animes are usually better than movies anyways.
1305000	1310000	The Tekken anime, my problem with that is that it was all completely done on computer,
1310000	1313000	and I prefer cel animation.
1313000	1316000	So, that's what was bad about that.
1316000	1319000	Yeah, it also had a lot of butt rock in it.
1319000	1321000	Well, the American one did.
1321000	1323000	Yeah, the US one.
1323000	1330000	Alright, well we're talking a lot about video games becoming movies, but now let's mention
1330000	1332000	movies becoming video games.
1332000	1337000	Pirates of the Caribbean, of course, actually that was a ride at Disneyland first and foremost.
1337000	1340000	Then it was a movie, and now it is an online MMO.
1340000	1342000	We've talked about this on the game before that it was coming.
1342000	1343000	It's now here.
1343000	1346000	If you want to check it out, piratesonline.com.
1346000	1352000	The basic game is free, but for $10 a month you get full access.
1352000	1356000	The game, by the way, is based off of the Toontown online engine,
1356000	1358000	so don't expect any cutting edge graphics.
1358000	1361000	I'm also wondering if it's based off Toontown online.
1361000	1364000	That probably means you can't actually type your own sentences.
1364000	1367000	You have to make things from the pre-rendered things that are in there
1367000	1370000	because we have to keep our children safe because these are Disney games.
1370000	1372000	Like using the Final Fantasy XI macros?
1372000	1374000	I don't know that for sure.
1374000	1375000	Don't quote me on that.
1375000	1376000	I don't know if that's the case in this game.
1376000	1378000	I don't know if any of our chatters have played it,
1378000	1380000	but I just know in Toontown that was the case.
1380000	1384000	I had a friend that played Toontown for a long-ass time, actually.
1384000	1388000	Pirates of the Caribbean, I wouldn't mind checking this out.
1388000	1391000	I would check it out, but puzzle pirates would probably still be better.
1391000	1392000	Maybe.
1392000	1397000	And plus, my fondness for Pirates of the Caribbean is the ride, not the movie.
1397000	1399000	I know that might be like blessed for me to some people,
1399000	1404000	but I could care less about John E. Depp.
1404000	1407000	Although he was a kind of cool addition to the ride
1407000	1410000	and some of the other stuff they added on the ride.
1410000	1414000	Anyhow, some of the stuff we're going to add to the Part B of our podcast tonight
1414000	1417000	is a segment we love and know and have here every week on the program.
1417000	1421000	It's the mailbag, and it's our chance to interact with you, the listener,
1421000	1424000	when you send us e-mails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1424000	1427000	Dark Sakura will pull out a few of her favorite e-mails,
1427000	1429000	and this week she has to be really picky
1429000	1431000	because we actually got a lot of e-mails this week.
1431000	1434000	Yeah, I still have a number I'm going to have to end up reading.
1434000	1437000	Sadly, Dark Sakura is going to have to be a bit choosy this week
1437000	1438000	in what e-mails she's reading.
1438000	1440000	Wait, did we get any jokes?
1440000	1442000	We'll see.
1442000	1443000	We will see.
1443000	1445000	All right, well, we have one that says,
1445000	1449000	Hey guys, I was wondering if you could recommend some older 360 games
1449000	1451000	that might be worth picking up used.
1451000	1453000	I was thinking about PSU, but not sure if it was any good.
1453000	1454000	Thanks.
1454000	1457000	This comes from Mark.
1457000	1462000	PSU sucks, so don't play it.
1462000	1464000	You're not going to get a deal on PSU either
1464000	1466000	because you still have that $10 monthly fee.
1466000	1469000	I don't think you can get that used because of that.
1469000	1471000	I think there's that whole, I don't know.
1471000	1472000	No, you can't.
1472000	1475000	You can't because you have to register an account.
1475000	1477000	I'll give you mine.
1477000	1479000	Do you want my copy?
1479000	1481000	I don't want it. Maybe the listener does.
1481000	1483000	Get in touch with the listener.
1483000	1485000	You can also play the offline version for free,
1485000	1488000	so don't necessarily think you have to play it online.
1488000	1491000	Plus, the expansion is coming out here pretty soon.
1491000	1493000	They've already done a butt load.
1493000	1498000	My friend, Julie, Castame19, she plays a butt ton.
1498000	1500000	She is always on that fucking game whenever I'm on live.
1500000	1502000	She does nothing but play that game.
1502000	1503000	Wow, amazing.
1503000	1505000	She's like, that's her ever crack.
1505000	1507000	Tips from the chat room.
1507000	1511000	Rob with two B's is mentioning Circuit City has PSU on the cheap.
1511000	1512000	So if you're interested in that,
1512000	1514000	some of the folks are recommending some games.
1514000	1516000	Act Deft recommending Condemned.
1516000	1519000	DMN recommending Crackdown.
1519000	1521000	Crackdown is the I like jumping game.
1521000	1524000	I recommend staying the hell away from Perfect Dark Zero, first off.
1524000	1526000	I liked Perfect Dark Zero.
1526000	1527000	You would.
1527000	1530000	But I would suggest Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
1530000	1534000	To me, that is the best 360 title.
1534000	1536000	Burnout.
1536000	1537000	Yes.
1537000	1539000	Okay, I do like crashing.
1539000	1541000	Even if it is an old game with souped up graphics.
1541000	1542000	How about Test Drive Unlimited?
1542000	1544000	That was a good game that I think...
1544000	1545000	How about no?
1545000	1547000	How about Kiss My Butt?
1547000	1551000	If you want some older games that have dropped in price, Dead Rising.
1551000	1553000	Yeah, Dead Rising is a good one.
1553000	1554000	If you can find that.
1554000	1557000	Actually, Far Cry Instincts Predator wasn't that bad.
1557000	1561000	I thought you said good games.
1561000	1568000	And then I would also say probably not Prey, that's for sure.
1568000	1569000	Definitely not Chromehounds.
1569000	1570000	Hey, I liked Prey.
1570000	1572000	Definitely not Chromehounds.
1572000	1575000	Prey was like Ghetto Portal.
1575000	1580000	But I wouldn't buy Burnout, because there's a new Burnout game coming out in January.
1580000	1583000	I would say probably...
1583000	1586000	Gosh.
1586000	1588000	Okay, we've given enough suggestions.
1588000	1594000	Well, it's not that old, but Oblivion is also really good for a solo game.
1594000	1595000	Alright, you have plenty of suggestions.
1595000	1597000	We have an email from another Mark.
1597000	1598000	Your suggestion quota is up.
1598000	1599000	Hi, Mark.
1599000	1600000	Hi, it's amazing.
1600000	1603000	My brother and I were talking about Count Decula, but we couldn't remember the name.
1603000	1605000	We also said you can't do that on television.
1605000	1606000	Farf.
1606000	1609000	About Loki's a few of the week to women.
1609000	1611000	If you haven't learned by now, you will.
1611000	1614000	You as a male will always lose arguments against women.
1614000	1616000	I didn't believe it when people told me.
1616000	1617000	True statement.
1617000	1618000	But it's true.
1618000	1621000	Men are from Mars and women have already invaded it and destroyed all that are holy.
1621000	1624000	Of course we have, because we're excellent.
1624000	1629000	So, I'm trying to find more short ones, because we've got a couple of long ones.
1629000	1635000	Wait, hold on, because I'm trying to load a little something for that last emailer.
1635000	1638000	Because I played the You Can't Do That television theme earlier.
1638000	1640000	Castle Decula.
1640000	1645000	Home for many centuries to a dreadful dynasty of vicious...
1645000	1647000	Tell me you would not play a fucking video game based on this.
1647000	1648000	This would be awesome.
1648000	1650000	The castle of Decula.
1650000	1657000	Legend has it that these foul beings can be destroyed by escape through the heart or exposure to sub-light.
1657000	1662000	This does not suffice, however, for they may be brought back to life by means of a secret.
1662000	1664000	I apologize, the audio is so low.
1664000	1667000	Once a century, when the moon is in the eighth house...
1667000	1669000	We've been wearing blood.
1669000	1671000	Are you kidding?
1671000	1676000	The latest reincarnation did not run, according to plan.
1676000	1677000	Ooh.
1677000	1678000	Oh, it's a kitchen.
1678000	1679000	Here's the techno part.
1679000	1680000	Yes.
1680000	1687000	In the vampire hall of fame, yeah, there's not a vampire in the other house.
1687000	1691000	You won't bite me from there, cause he's a virgin, yeah.
1691000	1695000	And things never burn flat for a while.
1695000	1700000	If you're looking for someone, you can always count upon.
1700000	1703000	This is the most random opening of Decula.
1703000	1707000	Count Decula.
1707000	1710000	For anyone who doesn't know, God, it's so loud.
1710000	1715000	Count Decula was actually a character from Danger Mouse.
1715000	1716000	Awesome.
1716000	1718000	If anyone who ever watched Danger Mouse.
1718000	1724000	So this other one says the classic game of the week segment seems to be like obscure cult hit of the week.
1724000	1727000	It says will you be featuring games that are a little more known to us?
1727000	1729000	But it's cyberbots.
1729000	1731000	Yeah, like everybody knows cyberbots.
1731000	1733000	To be honest, I think part of the charm...
1733000	1734000	A lot of people know cyberbots.
1734000	1738000	Part of the charm is that she's featuring games that a lot of us miss.
1738000	1739000	To me, that's kind of the point.
1739000	1744000	I mean, if she were to go back and say today's classic game of the week is Contra.
1744000	1747000	Y'all fucking played Contra.
1747000	1748000	Maybe she'll feature it later.
1748000	1749000	I don't know.
1749000	1750000	I kind of like the obscurity for now.
1750000	1757000	Well, keep in mind that all of the classic games that I like are really the more obscure ones anyway.
1757000	1761000	So, of course, if I'm going to be picking out the games, I'm going to be picking out all the weird shit that I like.
1761000	1764000	You know, but I covered Fantasy Zone. That's not obscure.
1764000	1765000	Yeah.
1765000	1770000	You know, okay, I'll do Guardian Legend.
1770000	1773000	Even that's kind of obscure for some people, but...
1773000	1774000	This is my favorite game.
1774000	1775000	I say do what you want.
1775000	1777000	You know, I'm going to do what I want.
1777000	1778000	That's right. I'm going to do what I want.
1778000	1779000	But...
1779000	1780000	I go to school and I kill people.
1780000	1782000	I'm wrong with gangs.
1782000	1783000	Yo, and so you know what?
1783000	1786000	Yeah, I digitally inserted Jabba the Hutt back in Star Wars.
1786000	1787000	I'll do what I want.
1787000	1788000	I'm wrong with gangs.
1788000	1795000	To be fair, I do like a good number of, you know, I guess more mainstream titles.
1795000	1798000	You know, I won't do one of Colibri.
1798000	1802000	You know, if anyone remembers that 32X classic.
1802000	1805000	But, you know, I would do, you know, like Knuckles Chaotix.
1805000	1807000	Yeah, that one was cool.
1807000	1808000	Alright.
1808000	1810000	Or, you know, Space Harrier.
1810000	1811000	Thanks for the feedback, but she'll do what she wants.
1811000	1812000	But do yourself a favor.
1812000	1815000	Check out some of these obscure games because they were actually kind of fun.
1815000	1819000	Yeah, I mean, you can find emulators of Cotton.
1819000	1820000	Cotton's great.
1820000	1824000	Cotton came out in the U.S. on Neo Geo Pocket Color.
1824000	1825000	And on the...
1825000	1827000	No, just on Neo Geo Pocket Color.
1827000	1828000	You know what?
1828000	1829000	Don't bother defending.
1829000	1831000	Just say, I'm going to do what I want.
1831000	1834000	I'm saying how people can find these games easily.
1834000	1835000	Oh, okay.
1835000	1836000	So it did have U.S. release.
1836000	1841000	Anyway, this one comes from J-Rod.
1841000	1842000	Hi, J-Rod.
1842000	1843000	Love the show you guys put on.
1843000	1845000	I really dig how the show is live.
1845000	1848000	I have two guitars on my PS2 with both Guitar Hero 1 and 2.
1848000	1853000	Now, the problem is I don't have my PS2 anymore, but I do have a PS3, a 60 gig that can play
1853000	1854000	the old PS2 games.
1854000	1858000	Apparently, Sony and everyone else didn't bother to make an adapter to get the Guitar
1858000	1859000	Hero controllers to work on the PS3.
1859000	1864000	I was wondering if any of you guys had any first-hand experiences or knew anyone who
1864000	1869000	did with the aftermarket adapters out there and could give me a recommendation or review
1869000	1870000	of any of them.
1870000	1871000	Thanks and keep up the awesome show.
1871000	1874000	I think Pelican makes one that works.
1874000	1876000	There is an adapter out there I know that works.
1876000	1878000	I would bet money it causes a delay, though.
1878000	1879000	I don't think it did.
1879000	1880000	Really?
1880000	1881000	Yeah.
1881000	1883000	I know there's one that we did as a story a while back.
1883000	1885000	Luckily, I didn't actually bet the money.
1885000	1889000	That actually does work, so I don't know.
1889000	1890000	Xenocore in chat room.
1890000	1891000	See, well, we don't know.
1891000	1893000	We can always rely on chat room.
1893000	1894000	Xenocore in chat says, not true.
1894000	1895000	I have the adapter.
1895000	1896000	So there you have it.
1896000	1897000	Whatever.
1897000	1898000	I don't know.
1898000	1903000	Well, also, I think that it's great that there's a...
1903000	1904000	Sony doesn't love you there.
1904000	1907920	I also think it's fantastic that it says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home
1907920	1910000	of the Neverending Salads.
1910000	1911320	I don't know why I find that funny.
1911320	1912320	Olive Garden.
1912320	1913320	Not for the Salads, though.
1913320	1914320	Do I know?
1914320	1917320	OLR, I appreciate that you guys tell us the Japanese release dates, but I was wondering
1917320	1922000	if you guys have any Japanese listeners, and I guess this comes from Thomas.
1922000	1923000	I think we do.
1923000	1924000	I'm pretty sure we do.
1924000	1928640	When we check the stats, we do see quite a number of connections from Japan, and we've
1928640	1931360	gotten emails from listeners in Japan before, too.
1931360	1936600	We've got people all over the world, because we are cool that way.
1936600	1938600	So now for the really freaking long emails.
1938600	1940160	How about that?
1940160	1941160	Yay.
1941160	1944000	Really freaking long email segment.
1944000	1948760	Dear OLR, pointing to a letter that was sent to you last week, it really assumes to me
1948760	1951920	that a fellow gamer can be so blatantly ignorant.
1951920	1955840	Has anyone ever considered the fact that one of the main reasons that Nintendo has managed
1955840	1959160	to stay afloat for so long is because of its first party games?
1959160	1963320	Starting with the Nintendo 64, the graphics of the system sucked.
1963320	1967200	The audio play was horrible, but it still managed to give you a few of the great franchises
1967200	1971680	that you and I loved, like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and other well-known franchises, and bring
1971680	1979440	them, though it still looked horrible, the GameCube may have been a different story.
1979440	1983000	In my opinion, the GameCube was a great system, while not on par with that of the Xbox and
1983000	1987120	PlayStation 2, it had excellent graphics, and almost all games played in high frame
1987120	1988120	rate.
1988120	2010320	It was a big deal when Prime came out, because it was OMGZ Metroid.
2010320	2034440	It also brought your favorite franchise into beautiful 3D detail, but it would have been
2034440	2036640	so much better if they had online play.
2036640	2042920	I wouldn't have even bought my GameCube if it didn't have a new Metroid game.
2042920	2046680	Nintendo's first party developers have managed to bring back our favorite franchises and
2046680	2049640	make us love them that much more with each new title.
2049640	2053120	It's mainly because of the fact that Nintendo first party developers and the fact that they
2053120	2057600	make such great games are the only reason Nintendo managed this far.
2057600	2062040	Though I may not know everything, I just want to point out that these few details are far
2062040	2065040	as it goes with Nintendo's first party games and developers.
2065040	2068000	Let's just hope that it doesn't repeat any past mistakes.
2068000	2071620	To the Yaris, this is a letter that was sent to the Xbox Live Arcade.
2071620	2072620	It said,
2072620	2074260	Dear Xbox Live Arcade,
2074260	2075840	We have always had a great relationship.
2075840	2078340	The day I met you, you sent me Geometry Wars.
2078340	2079340	Now you sent me Yaris.
2079340	2080760	Does this mean you're breaking up with me?
2080760	2081760	Sincerely, Anonymous
2081760	2107240	Hi O.L.R., I love your show, y'all are amazing, do we have a southern guy?
2107240	2108240	Cool.
2108240	2112760	I listened to y'all everywhere I go, and named my firstborn daughter Skye.
2112760	2113760	Wow.
2113760	2116760	Send the birth certificate as proof, I don't believe it.
2116760	2120720	So on and so forth, pleasantries aside, to beat the proverbial dead horse, your qualms
2120720	2125280	concerning the term microtransactions would give even Captain Jean-Luc Picard a headache
2125280	2126280	of massive proportions.
2126280	2128040	Oh, not this debate again.
2128040	2131480	Granted, I agree with you wholeheartedly, Dark Soccer, that a transaction on any scale
2131480	2134140	is a transaction no matter the amount of money involved.
2134140	2137840	The term microtransaction is merely an industry buzzword to help encourage sales of downloadable
2137840	2139680	data, unlock content, buy the ignorant masses.
2139680	2142560	It's stupid, it's asinine, but it's business.
2142560	2143840	I agree.
2143840	2148080	That being said, to refer to microtransactions as being an SI unit, hence spouting, is a
2148080	2151760	microtransaction one millionth of a transaction as equally as asinine?
2151760	2153520	Well, true, yeah.
2153520	2157040	Would you say Halo 3 sold three gigacopies?
2157040	2158760	Okay.
2158760	2162680	Micro in this sense is not used as a prefix for an actual numerical factor such as centi,
2162680	2169040	milli, kilo, nano, etc., but more as a description of relative size in contrast with macro.
2169040	2172320	Refer to the established English terms of macroeconomics and microeconomics, if you
2172320	2173320	will.
2173320	2175760	But no one says microtransactions anyway.
2175760	2176760	Why?
2176760	2181660	Because as the English language is to buzzwords, human being is to a horribly grotesque cross-species
2181660	2184000	partial abortion, think Minotaur.
2184000	2188100	It never should have been and should have been put out of its misery, which I'm quite
2188100	2193840	sure the entirety of Orange Lodge Radio will be quite eager to do after reading this superfluous,
2193840	2197840	verbose, and...
2197840	2200640	Thank you, whoever emailed this animator to read these words.
2200640	2203240	Hey, I have very good pronunciation, thank you.
2203240	2206280	A mixationally nitpicky email comprised of run-on sentences.
2206280	2208080	I do have to agree with you there.
2208080	2209520	It is fairly run-on.
2209520	2214680	Although actually you are grammatically correct in your last sentence, I have to say.
2214680	2218200	I shall spare you any further opportunities to become tongue-tied and I wish you all the
2218200	2219200	best.
2219200	2222320	I look forward to each episode as eagerly as the cocaine addict awaits for his next
2222320	2223320	hit of snow.
2223320	2225400	Rubber Buggy Baby Bumpers, D.J.
2225400	2226400	Dysentery.
2226400	2227400	And by the way, you...
2227400	2228400	By the way...
2228400	2231960	Okay, he obviously was putting that in just to fuck with you.
2231960	2236240	By the way, you misspelled cocaine.
2236240	2237280	The end!
2237280	2239680	When did I go back to college English class?
2239680	2240920	I know, for real.
2240920	2242920	This reminds me of fan fiction.
2242920	2244760	I think someday, like, you know, when...
2244760	2246680	Wordy and pointless?
2246680	2251440	Inevitably, this show must end someday and obviously, you know, we don't want it to end
2251440	2256480	tomorrow, but inevitably we will go our separate ways someday and I totally see Dark Sakura
2256480	2259920	starting a grammar Nazi podcast.
2259920	2260920	There already is one.
2260920	2261920	Is there really?
2261920	2262920	I'm pretty sure there already is one.
2262920	2263920	I wouldn't be surprised.
2263920	2264920	There's also...
2264920	2270800	You can find a podcast, no, there is a grammar Nazi podcast because somebody has sent it
2270800	2271800	to me.
2271800	2272800	Where?
2272800	2273800	No, I'm not even kidding.
2273800	2274800	Where can I download it?
2274800	2281840	I can't remember who did it, but I listened to it about a year and a half ago where they
2281840	2287000	would receive emails about, you know, different grammatical mistakes and then try to give
2287000	2291720	you the proper way to say that and certain usages and when it's appropriate to use this
2291720	2298440	spelling or that spelling and I also found one that was all about the differences between
2298440	2299920	British English and American English.
2299920	2302680	Where can I get that podcast?
2302680	2304880	LOL.
2304880	2305880	You know what?
2305880	2309100	You can do what everybody else does and search for it on iTunes.
2309100	2310100	I don't want to.
2310100	2313360	I hate that my iPhone is making me use iTunes, though.
2313360	2314360	Can you continue?
2314360	2315360	What?
2315360	2316360	We is done.
2316360	2317360	Oh, no more emails?
2317360	2318360	We is done.
2318360	2320100	We is done.
2320100	2321960	We done good on those emails.
2321960	2325320	All right, if you want to email us, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
2325320	2328120	Sorry to the people we didn't get to tonight.
2328120	2329120	There's just too damn many emails.
2329120	2330120	What can we say?
2330120	2331120	Back to the gaming news.
2331120	2335080	Anyways, with all these patches and stuff being applied to new games for the PlayStation
2335080	2339400	3 and games that you might already have on the PlayStation 3, to support the DualShock
2339400	2345760	3 has gotten a lot of people wondering, hey, maybe I can just import a Japanese DualShock
2345760	2352140	controller into my non-Japanese country and get to play these games with rumble-tastic
2352140	2355760	features sooner than everybody else.
2355760	2356760	Nope.
2356760	2361080	Because apparently importers like PlayASIA said they've already pre-sold their expected
2361080	2370920	supply and Sony, of course, doesn't support importing stuff, so you will not be able to
2370920	2373400	probably buy any anytime soon.
2373400	2380480	Because actually importers are charging upwards to $80 per joystick for what you would probably
2380480	2384440	normally get for $50 and I'm sure that's going to go up.
2384440	2389220	Of course, new games, they just had a patch for Resistance Fall Man that added rumble.
2389220	2392060	I know MotorStorm has rumble now.
2392060	2395880	There was a patch with Ratchet and Clank Future that has rumble.
2395880	2397720	Just fucking wait.
2397720	2400640	Why would they have to patch in rumble features?
2400640	2406440	Because you know the original 6-axis controller had no rumble, because rumble would interfere
2406440	2412020	with the tilt sensors somehow in this magical world, because you can't actually have tilt
2412020	2421040	and rumble in the same controller, oh wait, no, Nintendo did that, I'm sorry.
2421040	2428280	Just wait, really, I mean, playing Resistance Fall Man with rumble is not going to make
2428280	2431280	it like, oh my god, this is the best game ever now.
2431280	2436200	The only game I really want to play with rumble is Rez, and I would hand off the rumble to
2436200	2437200	someone else.
2437200	2438880	Because you know Rez is on the PS3.
2438880	2444160	We've all read that article.
2444160	2448920	Well we have a, I guess, late breaking news thing, I'm going to jump in here with something
2448920	2452200	that's panning out live while the show is going on.
2452200	2459580	I need like a fanfare or something, or we need something, I don't know.
2459580	2460580	What do we have?
2460580	2462040	How about a drum roll with a laptop?
2462040	2466720	I'm looking for a fanfare noise, hold on, let's see.
2466720	2467720	Like the little windows?
2467720	2469760	Oh here we go, yes, we've got it.
2469760	2479880	Now some late breaking news.
2479880	2485000	Act Deft is practically flooding our chat room with what is going on in the latest Game
2485000	2486580	Facts Battle.
2486580	2489980	You know, every damn year they do a character battle, every year.
2489980	2494640	This is the sixth year of the character battle, and what makes this year different is that
2494640	2500720	instead of two characters doing battle, it's groups of four, and then two emerge victorious.
2500720	2506520	Well we are now down to the final four, and typical winners Link and Cloud are in there,
2506520	2507640	they've both won before.
2507640	2513280	Solid Snake is also in the top four, but this is the amazing thing, is that this looks to
2513280	2520900	be the very first year that a Final Fantasy character or a Link character will not win
2520900	2522280	the character battle.
2522280	2530800	That is because with 45 minutes to go, and 33% of the vote, L-Block is winning the character
2530800	2531800	battle.
2531800	2532800	Yay!
2532800	2540200	So NBC News has declared an L-Block victory tonight in the great character battle elections.
2540200	2541480	Congratulations to the L-Block.
2541480	2544160	Did I miss something?
2544160	2545160	Seriously?
2545160	2546800	Because Tetris is a pone.
2546800	2550920	Because somehow an L-Block just fucking beat all these other characters, but I think, you
2550920	2553880	know what though, well deserved, honestly.
2553880	2558600	Well deserved, because Tetris is one of those games I think people forget, you know, that
2558600	2560380	is the casual game.
2560380	2564040	That was the casual game that really opened up the gaming door to a lot of people.
2564040	2567080	I'm just glad that news had nothing to do with Tingle, so that's, I thought for a second
2567080	2571920	there they were just going to be like, yeah, Tingle's going to win, and I'm like, fuck.
2571920	2573920	That's going to suck.
2573920	2575560	Well I can't wait for that, yeah.
2575560	2576560	That'll never happen.
2576560	2580520	This just in, I Have Judgment sold its millionth copy, hope you get the tights.
2580520	2584080	There's some interesting things about I Have Judgment too that I heard of.
2584080	2589760	Do you know how many people have come in to chat tonight and said, one down, 999,999 to
2589760	2590760	go.
2590760	2592520	Our whole contest has become counter productive.
2592520	2596160	We are driving sales of I Have Judgment.
2596160	2597520	I heard they have issues.
2597520	2599080	How so?
2599080	2601340	I heard they have a subscription.
2601340	2606240	They have similar issues to Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.
2606240	2608140	Interesting.
2608140	2609640	Certain integral parts of...
2609640	2612400	They're not even going to be able to make a million of them.
2612400	2617000	You goddamn cheater.
2617000	2618680	Loki fucking cheated in this contest.
2618680	2620720	He knew they didn't have the parts to make a million of them.
2620720	2622400	How about I cleanse the pallet?
2622400	2623400	Asshole.
2623400	2626440	And didn't I say this was going to happen?
2626440	2627440	Didn't I tell you?
2627440	2630040	No, wait, I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't do my actual story.
2630040	2631040	I have one question.
2631040	2632040	Oh, I thought you did.
2632040	2633040	No.
2633040	2634040	Well, fine.
2634040	2635040	I have to do the Famitsu story real quick.
2635040	2636040	Fine, do it.
2636040	2639200	You're going off on your tangents, confusing me.
2639200	2640200	Sorry.
2640200	2641200	Goddammit.
2641200	2642200	Chocolate.
2642200	2646640	Get the bitch some chocolate, Christ almighty.
2646640	2649600	But I'm not going to eat it.
2649600	2650600	Here you go.
2650600	2653960	And damn it, I accidentally closed the tab that had this story on it, now I can't even
2653960	2654960	do it.
2654960	2659320	Famitsu ran a list of the top 100 games that readers dig, and actually this is kind of
2659320	2663320	similar to the character battle because I believe all the top games were basically Final
2663320	2665240	Fantasy games and Zelda games.
2665240	2667920	I'm trying to bring up the list right now.
2667920	2671440	Our very own Dark Tetsuya pulled some highlights from the list for us here.
2671440	2676120	Let's see, at the top of the list, Final Fantasy X, followed by Final Fantasy VII, followed
2676120	2679440	by Dragon Quest III, followed by Dragon Quest VIII.
2679440	2681720	So the top four were all Squeenix games.
2681720	2688120	Then we have Machi, followed by Final Fantasy IV, Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy III, Dragon
2688120	2690640	Quest VII, and then Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
2690640	2693920	So basically half of the top ten were Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games.
2693920	2696080	And almost all of them are RPGs.
2696080	2697080	Fuck that.
2697080	2698080	We're done.
2698080	2699080	We're that.
2699080	2700080	Anyway.
2700080	2703280	Other notable games on the chart, we should point out, Street Fighter II came in at number
2703280	2704280	20.
2704280	2707160	The Super Mario Brothers came in at 21.
2707160	2710440	Final Fantasy VI was in 25.
2710440	2711440	The fuck?
2711440	2712440	VI is like one of the best ones.
2712440	2715160	But Final Fantasy VII has more fandom-y stuff.
2715160	2716160	Oh well.
2716160	2718080	Japan, you screwed that up.
2718080	2720000	Chrono Trigger, number 28.
2720000	2722200	Kingdom Hearts II, number 29.
2722200	2724800	The original Legend of Zelda, 46.
2724800	2727360	51, Pokemon Red and Green.
2727360	2732320	And if you want to know where L-Block ended up on the Famitsu list, 96 was where Tetris
2732320	2733720	Game Boy ended up.
2733720	2734720	Gradius was on there.
2734720	2735920	Gradius was 98.
2735920	2737160	Super Mario Brothers 3 was 99.
2737160	2739320	I want to know where R-Type is.
2739320	2742880	Well, you'll just have to pick up this week's Famitsu magazine.
2742880	2745720	I don't want to go to San Francisco to go buy it.
2745720	2747720	Okay, you can do your story now.
2747720	2748720	Okay.
2748720	2750800	Now again, didn't I say this was going to happen?
2750800	2754600	And don't get me wrong, I love the technology.
2754600	2757720	I have one myself built into my PS3.
2757720	2758720	I love Blu-Ray.
2758720	2763240	But I also loved Betamax.
2763240	2765920	And Betamax was far superior to VHS.
2765920	2769400	I would also like to point out Dark Sakura has an impressive LaserDisc collection.
2769400	2773720	I do, because I used to go to anime conventions and they'd sell LaserDisc for five bucks a
2773720	2774720	piece.
2774720	2777080	So basically, if Dark Sakura likes your media format, you're fucked.
2777080	2779480	She probably has a collection of 8-tracks somewhere.
2779480	2781780	LaserDisc did last for a while.
2781780	2785840	It was the enthusiast format.
2785840	2788400	You could saw off someone's head with one of those things, too.
2788400	2790120	Yeah, they were pretty heavy.
2790120	2794240	What ever happened to VideoDisc?
2794240	2795240	Can you imagine?
2795240	2797640	We rented Dumbo on VideoDisc once.
2797640	2798640	I'll never forget it.
2798640	2801560	Hey, remember this big plastic-coated...
2801560	2804960	Yeah, they were like LaserDiscs but in a giant plastic tray.
2804960	2809460	Hey, can you imagine if they had a Blu-Ray that was the size of a LaserDisc?
2809460	2812080	How much fucking space you can have on there?
2812080	2814680	Yeah, that's in the next PlayStation 4.
2814680	2817040	Yo, what the fuck is this giant slot in here for?
2817040	2818040	Here's the games!
2818040	2823080	These are all of our releases for the year!
2823080	2824260	Enjoy.
2824260	2825960	That would fucking rock.
2825960	2831680	I hope PlayStation 4 has those large pizza-sized discs.
2831680	2837640	I want my next system to be the size of three Atari 5200s.
2837640	2838640	The end.
2838640	2843120	I want to weigh as much as ten Xboxes.
2843120	2845760	I want to have to get a dolly to put this thing in my house.
2845760	2849760	You know the Xbox is larger than an Atari 5200, but not wider.
2849760	2851480	Tangent, what were you going to say about Blu-Ray?
2851480	2854480	Kmart's not selling them anymore, so anyone...
2854480	2862280	Whatever, you know, no one really shops at Kmart.
2862280	2865840	I didn't know Kmart was still around.
2865840	2869480	I love the personal opinion that gets interjected in this show.
2869480	2870480	Okay, I take that back.
2870480	2871480	Here's tonight's news.
2871480	2875760	Kmart pulled Blu-Ray, whatever, no one shops at Kmart.
2875760	2876840	I take that back.
2876840	2882480	I did buy pillows at Kmart because they were on sale, and I bought my sheets for my massage
2882480	2885160	at Kmart, but other than that, no one shops at Kmart.
2885160	2890140	Okay, I don't know if Kmart's exactly the demographic for Blu-Ray.
2890140	2891280	That's exactly what I'm saying.
2891280	2895420	Who thinks, gee, I'm going to go get a Blu-Ray player, where can I get a really good top-of-line
2895420	2898480	Blu-Ray player that's, I'm going to go to Kmart?
2898480	2902720	Well, keep in mind, even though Kmart did declare bankruptcy, they did go back and buy
2902720	2905280	Sears, so...
2905280	2908760	Okay, if I want an Icee, I'll go to Kmart.
2908760	2913040	I go there to buy sheets from my massage table, and that's about it.
2913040	2915880	Or if, heaven forbid, I want something from the Martha Stewart collection, I'll go to
2915880	2916880	Kmart.
2916880	2917880	My pillows.
2917880	2919240	Or if I want to go laugh at the poor people.
2919240	2921280	Just kidding.
2921280	2922280	I'm among you.
2922280	2924780	And Rama is yelling in chat, hey, damn it.
2924780	2926200	I shop at Kmart.
2926200	2929980	Raven's Dolphin says, shit, I shop at Kmart.
2929980	2935040	Much like I go back to the conversation we had in part A, where I said, LARPing, something
2935040	2940000	you don't really want to admit to.
2940000	2941000	You know what?
2941000	2944680	Here's the reason why I don't, okay, here's the reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore,
2944680	2945680	even though this isn't supposed to be an Instagram podcast.
2945680	2946680	Dude, they have little Caesars.
2946680	2947680	Okay.
2947680	2948680	That's why I shop at Kmart.
2948680	2955920	Actually, I do also sometimes buy my DVR discs for my camera.
2955920	2957320	Okay, here's the thing.
2957320	2961680	I used to, my fondest memories of going to Kmart, going shopping were in the 80s.
2961680	2964800	Like we used to go, you know, it'd be like a big department store trip day, we're going
2964800	2965800	to go to Kmart.
2965800	2966800	Here's the problem.
2966800	2970040	There's a reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore, because the store hasn't fucking
2970040	2973840	changed a thing since the 80s, besides what's on the shelves.
2973840	2976520	No, not even the clothes.
2976520	2977520	Except.
2977520	2978520	Yes.
2978520	2983720	I did find a cute sweater there, but it also was like one of those 80s revival styles.
2983720	2987080	I think I saw some underwear for sale that was actually from the 80s.
2987080	2989620	I bought socks.
2989620	2994000	You can buy socks at Kmart, because socks, you know, are socks.
2994000	2998440	I think they actually still have those doors that you have to like step on the mat where
2998440	3002680	it triggers the door before infrared technology or something like that.
3002680	3005080	Okay, can we move on before we get the hate mail from Kmart?
3005080	3007880	Okay, they're not carrying Blu-ray players anymore, so whatever.
3007880	3011520	Yeah, the hate mail from that one Kmart person.
3011520	3012520	Okay.
3012520	3017800	Anyways, here's some exciting news, and I'm going to say this is very specific.
3017800	3019080	It has nothing to do with Kmart.
3019080	3020840	It has nothing to do with Kmart.
3020840	3025320	LucasArts and Bioware are teaming up for something.
3025320	3028360	Yes, that's right.
3028360	3032340	They're working on an undisclosed interactive entertainment product.
3032340	3034440	But it's LucasArts and Bioware, so what else do we know?
3034440	3035440	It's going to be awesome.
3035440	3037600	It's going to be like Knights of the Old Republic or something like that.
3037600	3041000	It's Knights of the Old Indiana Jones Republic, that's right.
3041000	3045680	I feel the need to say something nice about Kmart now.
3045680	3050480	They do carry the Diet Cranberry Serumist.
3050480	3054200	I will pre-order the LucasArts Bioware game at Kmart, no I won't.
3054200	3057840	But I will tell you one thing that Kmart is good for.
3057840	3064800	They don't care about street dates because that's where I got Serenity like two weeks
3064800	3068160	before it came out and I got it as an early Christmas gift for Xtrafer and he was all
3068160	3071560	excited because he had Serenity on DVD for any of his friends.
3071560	3073600	I'm sorry, LucasArts?
3073600	3075600	They're making something.
3075600	3076600	Okay.
3076600	3077600	Hooray!
3077600	3084160	Rumors, rumors, rumors, and this rumor has something to do with Oblivion, that's right,
3084160	3087800	The Elder Scrolls Oblivion, the game that just won't stay out in the news.
3087800	3093360	This game has been making headlines since it came out and now it should be noted that
3093360	3098800	the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, that's ZeniMax Media, has registered the domain
3098800	3102800	name Elderscrollsonline.com.
3102800	3103800	Oh my God!
3103800	3105260	A website.
3105260	3110360	Could this mean that Elder Scrolls Oblivion could make its way online, be an MMO?
3110360	3114040	Hell, somebody already hacked the game to do this on the PC version.
3114040	3116640	Could this be a further way to milk the Oblivion franchise?
3116640	3117640	Who knows?
3117640	3119360	It could give World of Warcraft a run for their money.
3119360	3121360	Puppy, how many hours have you spent on Oblivion?
3121360	3122360	A lot.
3122360	3123360	A lot.
3123360	3124360	Let's leave a lot, right?
3124360	3126280	A lot in a two week span of time, yes.
3126280	3127840	So what would you think of this?
3127840	3131880	If there was an Oblivion online, would you play it or is this jumping the shark?
3131880	3132880	I don't know.
3132880	3139720	It would, with as much, you'll play it, characterization and customization there is, I don't know.
3139720	3145180	They would have to do a lot to expand the world because running around in the worlds
3145180	3150640	in Oblivion, it's like running, running, running, running, tree, rock, tree, rock, oh look a
3150640	3155280	rabbit run, run, run, run, run, run, oh look, hey look, a dungeon, we're going to be punching
3155280	3161240	horses online, in the face, a sheep tossing contest would be fun, good times.
3161240	3163560	Yeah, but you know what it doesn't have?
3163560	3166300	You can't kick bugs in the face.
3166300	3167880	You can kick sheep in the face, probably.
3167880	3168880	They're big enough to kick.
3168880	3171680	You can't kick bees in the face.
3171680	3175880	You can't, Aragorondo.
3175880	3179280	Sorry, I'm looking at chat right now.
3179280	3182560	I got to go back to the Kmart thing because this shit's funny.
3182560	3190920	SSJ100Matt in chat says, Kmart still sells Rockus Dukakis shirts.
3190920	3196000	Hilarity.
3196000	3203640	Robwood2B says, I go to Kmart to trip over stuff in the aisles.
3203640	3204880	Blue Light Special.
3204880	3206880	Okay, anyway, sorry.
3206880	3212040	Okay, so Elder Scrolls may be online, at least if recent domain names are to be believed.
3212040	3218360	Skypline is opening soon, you can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our user name on Skype
3218360	3219720	is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3219720	3223320	We have a couple more stories before we get there, right Jamie?
3223320	3228040	Yes, if someone would stop hogging the mic, puppy.
3228040	3235440	You know, you're no longer a foreign correspondent, you live in my town now.
3235440	3237480	You can be our resident puppy.
3237480	3239040	Video game story.
3239040	3241040	Hey Rob, guess what?
3241040	3242040	What?
3242040	3243040	Kmart.
3243040	3248160	Okay, so Namco Bandai, dun dun dun.
3248160	3251940	I agree with Misty, why would you want to kick a bee in the face anyway?
3251940	3255520	Just because it's the act of kicking a bee in the face.
3255520	3261240	Oh, well shit, I'm so sorry.
3261240	3264240	Just because it's the novelty.
3264240	3265720	How dare I?
3265720	3266720	What?
3266720	3270120	I don't know, Loki, you're just like, you're looking patient over there like, I want this
3270120	3271120	show to finish.
3271120	3274400	No, he's watching that video again.
3274400	3277040	I'm not watching that video again.
3277040	3278040	Okay.
3278040	3279040	Namco Bandai.
3279040	3280040	Yes, Namco Bandai.
3280040	3287720	I have announced a Wii exclusive, Soul Calibur Legends, which is very, very happy.
3287720	3291760	We will have everybody so far, hopefully new people.
3291760	3295040	Wait, I think we're getting some late breaking news, Rob.
3295040	3296040	Oh yes, oh sorry.
3296040	3297040	Late breaking news.
3297040	3306440	I'm sorry, here's...
3306440	3310440	We go to our correspondent, Loki, live in the OLR studio with late breaking news.
3310440	3316440	Yes, apparently the reaction to Soul Calibur Legends going gold is, what could he do?
3316440	3318000	Who gives a fuck?
3318000	3319360	It's going to be crappy anyways.
3319360	3326720	Hey, did anyone remember, what was that, that stupid game with, it's like a spinoff of Tekken?
3326720	3329920	God, I've blocked it from my brain, but...
3329920	3332760	Oh, the one that had Nina, it starred Nina, didn't it?
3332760	3333760	Yeah.
3333760	3334760	Yeah.
3334760	3335760	Yeah, Death by Degrees.
3335760	3336760	Thank you.
3336760	3337760	Death by Degrees.
3337760	3338760	Yeah, yeah.
3338760	3339760	That's this game all over again.
3339760	3340760	Yeah.
3340760	3345240	Ivy, Death by Degrees.
3345240	3346240	No.
3346240	3347240	But will she have the whip?
3347240	3348240	That's all we need to know.
3348240	3352560	I actually kind of wanted Death by Degrees just because of me being a big Tekken nerd.
3352560	3356720	I even have this, okay, I even have the dumb Tekken game that was on Wonderswan.
3356720	3358640	That's pretty sad.
3358640	3359640	It was like Tekken Kart.
3359640	3361800	That's like buying Tekken on your cell phone.
3361800	3362800	Alright.
3362800	3365560	Does it come on cell phone?
3365560	3369840	Quick, another story, then the Skype line.
3369840	3372640	Anyways, um, yes.
3372640	3379820	So this totally, I don't know, perpetuates all those stereotypes of Halo 3 players.
3379820	3386480	Apparently a child assaulted his mother and attacked the police because he was ordered
3386480	3391120	to stop playing Halo 3, which right there, you had it coming.
3391120	3395040	I mean, seriously, you're making your child play a mature rated game, or I should say
3395040	3398000	you're allowing your child to play a mature rated game.
3398000	3405000	Um, the trouble began when the youth was told by his mother to turn off his Xbox 360 as
3405000	3406520	it was getting late.
3406520	3411520	After he refused, his mother took his AirCard, which is apparently an adapter you can use
3411520	3417040	for your cell phone to get Wi-Fi, from the 360, preventing him from playing online and
3417040	3421800	prompting a fit of rage that would see the child frantically search through the house
3421800	3425540	before punching his mom in the face.
3425540	3430880	The kid then retreated to his room, but soon had to deal with the local sheriff deputies
3430880	3434480	who his mom had called following the assault.
3434480	3440880	Deputies entered his room using a key kept by the mother, but also fell foul to the youth's
3440880	3441880	rage.
3441880	3446460	He managed to punch one of the deputies square in the face, which then he was restrained
3446460	3447460	and handcuffed.
3447460	3452480	He would later be turned over to the state juvenile authorities of charges of battery
3452480	3457560	hunting domestic violence and battery on a law enforcement officer.
3457560	3463520	God, kids these days.
3463520	3465200	Kids do the darndest things.
3465200	3472160	But now I can just imagine people on Halo yelling, oh you stupid mother puncher!
3472160	3477720	Well dude this is stupid anyways, I mean your fucking kid is like playing Halo and it's
3477720	3479160	a mature rated game.
3479160	3482520	Oh my god, it must be the violence of the game that caused him to punch his mom in the
3482520	3483520	face.
3483520	3490000	What I really want to know is what have they been doing to their child up to that point
3490000	3494440	that they would have a violent reaction or maybe their child already had psychological
3494440	3495440	problems.
3495440	3496440	You know.
3496440	3499440	Took them to Kmart.
3499440	3505120	Here's our new O.L.R. in joke.
3505120	3506120	We have Kmart.
3506120	3508120	Hey Timmy, it's Disneyland.
3508120	3509840	This is Kmart.
3509840	3510840	No it's Disneyland.
3510840	3511840	Kmart.
3511840	3512840	No Disneyland.
3512840	3513840	Go play.
3513840	3521320	But it seems to me that there had to have been a pre-existing problem for their child
3521320	3527560	to react that way because I have seen children play Halo 3 and been just fine and not want
3527560	3532040	to punch anybody when their parents said, okay we can't play on Dan's Xbox anymore.
3532040	3538720	But mom, I was fragging some fucking noobs.
3538720	3547040	You know, Dan's little, his cousin's kid comes over and plays games at our house sometimes.
3547040	3549120	And has he ever punched you in the face?
3549120	3550720	No.
3550720	3552640	He's always been well behaved.
3552640	3555620	That's because his parents teach him right.
3555620	3558800	I think it's a fault with the parents but I do think it's good that she did call, you
3558800	3565560	know, have him actually, you know, stand accountable for what he did.
3565560	3568160	Shadow Charlie asks, how old was this kid?
3568160	3571800	The age and name were withheld.
3571800	3575600	I heard he was just 15 or something like that.
3575600	3578640	I heard, you suck.
3578640	3581560	Oh, your mom.
3581560	3587520	It was some Florida kid.
3587520	3590080	Indian River County website.
3590080	3594360	They have a website for Indian River County for Florida.
3594360	3596640	Where to stay, where to dine, what to do.
3596640	3601640	Discover our lifestyle choices including dying with pictures of old people on a golf course
3601640	3604320	and on a beach and in a dining room.
3604320	3605320	Dying.
3605320	3606320	Sorry.
3606320	3608320	Lordy, lordy, lordy.
3608320	3611280	All right, let's open up the Skype line.
3611280	3617480	If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype.
3617480	3623680	Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio and you can comment on any of tonight's stories or you can make
3623680	3624680	a Kmart joke.
3624680	3625680	I don't really care.
3625680	3629720	Tonight, after tonight's show, I'm like crying from laughing so hard.
3629720	3630720	It's not that funny.
3630720	3633640	I know I'm going to be listening to this show like in the car later so I'm going to go,
3633640	3634760	this show really wasn't that funny.
3634760	3635960	Why were you laughing so much?
3635960	3638760	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
3638760	3641320	It's the Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.
3641320	3644000	Hi, Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.
3644000	3645280	Did you just get back from Kmart?
3645280	3649920	Yes, I just got back from Kmart and guess what, there is no blue-way players.
3649920	3652480	All right, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
3652480	3653480	Mario Galaxy.
3653480	3654480	That's what's on my mind.
3654480	3657560	Ah, yes, you are Mr. Gay is Mario Galaxy.
3657560	3659640	I know, but let's not go there.
3659640	3662680	All right, what about Mario Galaxy?
3662680	3667360	Did you realize that the, I know Jamie said that she's getting a retail copy at her store
3667360	3671320	so I actually got the chance to play it at a GameStop.
3671320	3673360	And what did you think, young man?
3673360	3674680	I think the game looked great.
3674680	3675920	I love the controls.
3675920	3678040	I think the game just looked great.
3678040	3684640	I mean, well, the game was on HGTV so it left a lot to be desired, which was a little sad,
3684640	3687160	a little sad about that, but the controls were great.
3687160	3689120	Everything was great about it.
3689120	3692280	Is this a game the kids across the country are going to be craving come this Christmas
3692280	3693280	season?
3693280	3694880	Craving, they're going to be dying for it.
3694880	3699200	You're going to be shooting each other like they were PS3s?
3699200	3701200	I don't know.
3701200	3705040	Well, I mean, you know, if you want to get the game, just never mind.
3705040	3708720	I was going to make a joke, but I'm beating that joke on the ground.
3708720	3711720	So Super Mario Galaxy, so awesome.
3711720	3717120	You'll punch your mother in the face just to play some more.
3717120	3718120	Is it?
3718120	3719120	Yeah.
3719120	3720120	Is the game that great?
3720120	3721120	Is it worth punching your mom in the face over?
3721120	3725880	I think so.
3725880	3730560	Let's go ahead and call his mom so that we know to hide what your child is saying.
3730560	3732160	All right.
3732160	3734280	What else did you call in to tell us about Ravenstaufen?
3734280	3737840	You just wanted to say that Mario Galaxy is cool?
3737840	3741320	Mario Galaxy and Phoenix, sorry, Charles and Turb about is very good.
3741320	3743320	Music's phenomenal.
3743320	3747880	You know Shane, who used to guest on this show a lot before he moved back to Kansas?
3747880	3751640	We have a Ventrilo server for World of Warcraft slash Final Fantasy XI, basically.
3751640	3753400	Be careful on those.
3753400	3754400	Yeah.
3754400	3758400	No, I want Ventrilo harassment guy to sign on to our Ventrilo.
3758400	3761080	I'm like, roll out the fucking red carpet for him.
3761080	3762960	I think that guy's fucking hilarious.
3762960	3767720	But anyway, I would be so honored if he came on and I'd be like, yay, it's Ventrilo harassment
3767720	3768720	guy.
3768720	3774280	Anyway, the thing about Shane though is that he has been signing on to Ventrilo this week
3774280	3775560	and we're like, Shane, where are you?
3775560	3777840	You're not in WoW and you're not playing Final Fantasy XI either.
3777840	3779560	He's like, oh, I'm playing Phoenix, right?
3779560	3780560	Right.
3780560	3783640	We're like, why are you signed on to Vent?
3783640	3784640	He's like, I don't know.
3784640	3785960	I just, you know, I'm playing Phoenix, right?
3785960	3786960	I just thought I'd say hello.
3786960	3788560	It's like, okay, I got to go.
3788560	3789560	I got a case.
3789560	3790560	You know what I need to do?
3790560	3791560	What?
3791560	3794320	I need to play Guild Wars and Ragnarok at the same time.
3794320	3795320	At the same time?
3795320	3796320	At the same time.
3796320	3797320	That'd be pretty hardcore.
3797320	3798320	All right.
3798320	3799320	One more thing.
3799320	3801840	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Ravensdolvin?
3801840	3802840	One more, one more.
3802840	3806440	You were talking about Count Ducula and all those good shows that's coming back.
3806440	3807440	Fuck yeah, we were.
3807440	3809960	I would love to see a Count Ducula show.
3809960	3814000	I mean, you know, we've been doing, I've been doing this experimental podcast called the
3814000	3815000	Cartoon Cast.
3815000	3818680	So we've been talking about Count Ducula and showing old cartoons like that.
3818680	3821400	So I would love to see a Count Ducula game.
3821400	3822400	Who wouldn't?
3822400	3823400	Me.
3823400	3824400	This is my favorite part.
3824400	3826840	I would not like to see a Count Ducula game.
3826840	3827960	Why?
3827960	3830480	Because the show's been off the air for years.
3830480	3833960	Okay, so Dragon Ball Z's been off the air for years.
3833960	3835500	Why are we still getting games?
3835500	3836500	Because Atari, that's all it got.
3836500	3837500	Well, you know what?
3837500	3840680	They probably still show episodes of it on the Kmart TVs.
3840680	3841680	Okay?
3841680	3847920	Look, I've seen episodes of Count Ducula on TV a while back, but that's what the internet's
3847920	3848920	for, right?
3848920	3849920	Exactly.
3849920	3850920	That and porn.
3850920	3851920	We've got YouTube.
3851920	3852920	All right.
3852920	3853920	That's amazing.
3853920	3854920	Is that it then, Ravenstaufen?
3854920	3855920	That is it.
3855920	3856920	Thank you for taking my call.
3856920	3857920	You are most welcome, sir.
3857920	3858920	Have a great week.
3858920	3859920	All right.
3859920	3861920	Wow, he hung up on himself.
3861920	3863280	I didn't even click the button.
3863280	3866560	If you want to give us a call or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, or our phone
3866560	3871240	number 1-877-GAME-OLR, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3871240	3872240	Who's this?
3872240	3875080	Oh, it's truly Legend of Zaku.
3875080	3876400	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3876400	3877400	What's on your mind?
3877400	3878400	Um, nothing.
3878400	3884320	Don't mind me for the fact that this girl just helped me a short while ago.
3884320	3885480	I'm sorry to hear that.
3885480	3886480	I am.
3886480	3890200	But yeah, I guess, you know- Whiskey makes it all better.
3890200	3891200	Jamie.
3891200	3892200	What?
3892200	3897880	Manhunt 2, you know, that whole controversy, that whole clusterfuck that rocks our man
3897880	3898880	to shove some beer.
3898880	3899880	Okay, seriously?
3899880	3902880	I got to stop you right here, okay?
3902880	3906180	After breaking up with your girlfriend, I would not recommend playing Manhunt 2.
3906180	3908320	That's going to give you a totally bad idea.
3908320	3910960	I'm not going to, I'm not homicidal, all right?
3910960	3914200	I've played Doom since I was like, what, 11?
3914200	3919160	So yeah, I guess, I don't know, I don't get why, you know, why companies like Rockstar
3919160	3925200	just, you know, they try to half-ass their way by just covering up stuff, you know, covering
3925200	3931800	up, you know, bits that were thrown back when the ASRP told them to, and all of a sudden,
3931800	3937880	you know, hackers find a way to make us gamers look bad, to make the industry look bad.
3937880	3942000	You know, and it was just, honestly, when they said, oh, we're going to mask this stuff,
3942000	3946800	that was just an open invite to the hackers to say, find out how we mask this and unmask
3946800	3947800	it.
3947800	3951760	I mean, I know, I know, you know, I can understand that, you know, that the rating, you know,
3951760	3957120	the rating board actually, you know, knew about the content that was blurred out.
3957120	3962480	But wouldn't it make more sense not to, you know, not to give, not to give ammunition
3962480	3968920	to, you know, to the critics, to anyone who's out to get people like Rockstar for the fact
3968920	3973960	that they get called out on stuff that was, you know, that was supposedly rejected before
3973960	3979280	but it's still in the game, just not seen, kind of like the whole hot coffee thing where,
3979280	3984520	you know, it still shouldn't, you know, still shouldn't have been on the disk in the first
3984520	3985520	place.
3985520	3990920	And they should have learned, not hiding, not obscuring it from, you know, from the
3990920	3997400	ratings board, not doing that, but just not having the common sense to not keep, you know,
3997400	3999480	to keep it out of the disk in the first place.
3999480	4004680	I don't, you know, so be it, you have to recreate the build but, you know, and that shit happens
4004680	4006640	in our job.
4006640	4010200	You know what just occurred to me because we were talking about Oblivion a little bit
4010200	4012720	ago?
4012720	4013800	This is very strange.
4013800	4015520	It just occurred to me.
4015520	4021540	Did they not make Bethesda go back and re-rate Oblivion because somebody found a way to hack
4021540	4024800	the game so that the girl's top could come off and you could have boobies?
4024800	4026960	But you also have to understand.
4026960	4029600	Isn't this the same fucking thing?
4029600	4037840	You also have to understand that we don't know whether or not that company submitted
4037840	4043680	all the assets for the characters for the ratings board.
4043680	4046920	Okay yeah yeah yeah but hold on I just had an epiphany with this whole thing.
4046920	4047920	I mean totally.
4047920	4048920	Wait a minute.
4048920	4049920	I just owned ESRB.
4049920	4053280	No no no no you didn't and here's why.
4053280	4056720	It's because that was on the PC that they did the mod.
4056720	4062520	The mods on PC's are fairly available whereas a PSP version the hack it means you have to
4062520	4064440	have an illegitimate copy of the game.
4064440	4067200	But still it's on principle.
4067200	4069040	What a fucking great line we are walking.
4069040	4071760	It shouldn't have been on the dead score on the actual game.
4071760	4073280	It's fucking boobies too.
4073280	4076560	I think they should have just taken the AO rating.
4076560	4081520	Honestly I think the problem is is that the AO rating is the kiss of death.
4081520	4082520	It's the same problem.
4082520	4086440	No the problem is that the AO rating means that your game does not get published for
4086440	4088240	the PlayStation 2, the Wii, or the PSP.
4088240	4089240	And that's the problem.
4089240	4090240	That's the problem.
4090240	4096040	You only get limited to one platform and but that's the other thing you have to understand
4096040	4100520	is that legislators right now they want to push bills that will add more you know quote
4100520	4107060	unquote truth in the ratings basically trying to you know find a way you know to call people
4107060	4112960	out for mods even though you know even if it wasn't there wasn't you know the responsibility
4112960	4119280	of the game the publisher I mean of the designer itself just for the fact that you know it
4119280	4125720	shouldn't it shouldn't give people shouldn't give hackers or any folks like that the tools
4125720	4128800	to create that much controversy to give them a channel.
4128800	4134380	All right I'm going to agree with Fursby in our chat room on that who says it's just fucking
4134380	4136000	pixels and I agree.
4136000	4141760	It's pixels but then it's something that the human you know the human brain could translate
4141760	4142760	as boobs.
4142760	4147960	Well let's also realize that the legislators making these decisions and trying to get all
4147960	4152280	this stuff done they're like generations behind us.
4152280	4158320	Yeah they're only they're only outscored political points you know the bill bills fake DDP Dan
4158320	4160960	that's it all they care about is keeping their seat.
4160960	4164880	Yeah once they die off and go away we'll get some smarter people in there and we're thinking
4164880	4165880	better.
4165880	4166880	All right.
4166880	4169120	But then we're going to run into the same complaints.
4169120	4172260	Zaku I gotta let you go because we're going on five minutes of this call we gotta get
4172260	4175080	some more calls but thank you for your perspective.
4175080	4179480	We appreciate it as always and sorry to hear about the girl there's plenty of fish in the
4179480	4180480	sea Zaku.
4180480	4181480	I'm right.
4181480	4182480	You'll find one.
4182480	4183480	All right.
4183480	4188160	If you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on skype orange launch radio hi
4188160	4189760	you're on orange launch radio who's this?
4189760	4191960	Hey this is Rob with two B's.
4191960	4194880	Wow Rob with two B's how you doing sir?
4194880	4198840	Yeah I'm doing fine I just decided to call in because it was too long to write in chat.
4198840	4203520	I was going to say I think we hear from you a lot on email and totally appreciate it but
4203520	4207160	I think this might be the first time I can recall you calling into the show.
4207160	4209080	It is the first time.
4209080	4214440	Well congratulations on making the great crossover from the written form to the verbal form.
4214440	4215440	It's good to hear from you.
4215440	4217800	What's on your mind?
4217800	4221400	VG Expo was this weekend.
4221400	4227160	That's right the America's VG Expo in Philly and didn't they actually got Jack Thompson
4227160	4228560	to go to their show didn't they?
4228560	4232120	They did and from what I've heard it was civil which is surprising.
4232120	4233120	Interesting.
4233120	4235280	Sorry I just said the forbidden phrase on the show my bad.
4235280	4237240	Especially since the man is near rabid.
4237240	4241040	Anyway what you want to say about America's VG Expo did you go Rob?
4241040	4247600	Yeah I went on Saturday it really is only worth a day trip if you live in the area.
4247600	4253200	It was in Philadelphia Convention Center which is downtown about 10 minutes from the airport
4253200	4257680	and I hate to admit it but it was a better location.
4257680	4266440	They had the Rock Band Tour, they had the Dell Intel Hi-Def Tour, I'm trying to remember
4266440	4274160	they had a few contests on Guitar Hero and alright that's all I can remember.
4274160	4275160	Sounds like there was a lot to see.
4275160	4277480	It sounds like it was E for All.
4277480	4284360	No I didn't go to E for All but you get done with things fast there.
4284360	4291800	Plus they didn't have much on the forums or anything.
4291800	4298840	Basically on the day I was there they had the journalists forum, they had the moral
4298840	4306040	combat movie, they had their Jack Thompson panel and they had something I skipped the
4306040	4309600	Postal 2 preview.
4309600	4311600	Sounds skippable.
4311600	4317280	I want to make it short so anybody who didn't go can understand what went on.
4317280	4321920	The Game Journalist Interviews is always a good one and nobody goes to it.
4321920	4326060	Gosh I can't remember the names of the people.
4326060	4327440	What kind of game journalists were they?
4327440	4331880	Were they independent folks like us that do podcasting or were we talking folks from Game
4331880	4334520	Spot, One Up type people?
4334520	4340640	Yes we had one from One Up, one from Game Stop, not Game Stop, EGM I'm sorry the original
4340640	4347000	editor of EGM when it was spelled out.
4347000	4355320	They had the director of marketing for Ziff Davis and he was really informative.
4355320	4360560	To make a long story short the best thing he said was if you want to be a game journalist
4360560	4367480	you should, he said this because it's in their own company, you should blog on One Up and
4367480	4372680	make reviews less than 90 words.
4372680	4373680	Wait
4373680	4374680	That's the best way to get noticed.
4374680	4379680	If you want to be a game journalist you should get reviews that are less than 90 words?
4379680	4380680	Yes
4380680	4385080	You're as sure as sucks.
4385080	4392960	It takes at least 10 more words to get your mom on mother of the year nominations.
4392960	4397680	Really really really really really really really really sucks.
4397680	4398880	Okay here we go here we go.
4398880	4404800	No I got it, Yaris, at least it's not ET on the Atari 2600.
4404800	4406440	Yeah we can't actually bury it.
4406440	4413680	Okay here we go here we go, Yaris, sucks, would rather have gone to Kmart.
4413680	4420920	The sound you hear is a dead horse being beaten over and over again in the studio.
4420920	4425960	Okay well the the Mortal Kombat movie is very good it could make you motion sick because
4425960	4433000	they have a really long quake sequence in there and it's a lot of video game graphics
4433000	4435960	running in the background while the interviews are going on.
4435960	4440720	It's actually in my opinion is too much video game graphics but they do some really funny
4440720	4444960	transitions so it's worth a it's worth a listen.
4444960	4449800	It leaves the gray area gray.
4449800	4456360	And then the Jack Thompson and the guy he was sparring against was Lorne Lanning of
4456360	4464520	who helped to co-created Oddworld Inhabitants and they were they were sparring off and Jack
4464520	4471080	was funny and he was civil and you know I really hate you know I don't have any dirt
4471080	4473440	on him he was he was very smart.
4473440	4477800	Well he knew he was in enemy territory I mean you know yeah he probably went back onto the
4477800	4481960	game politics put comment forums a couple hours later and started slandering.
4481960	4484280	They all smelled like ass.
4484280	4491640	I know his comments on game politics are really like personality too.
4491640	4496000	Well Rob we can oh yeah go ahead oh Lorne pretty much lost the interview because he
4496000	4502160	got emotional and he and he started attacking Jackie Pooh's character which was really a
4502160	4507960	mistake and you know it doesn't matter who won it doesn't change my opinion.
4507960	4512680	I agree it's just one debate he may have won the battle but he hasn't won the war.
4512680	4518120	And you should have seen they made us go through the security check.
4518120	4519120	Good times.
4519120	4523080	Well Rob we got to let you go but we we really appreciate the call talking about the VG Expo
4523080	4527120	which we all forgot happened so I'm glad somebody was there to remind us all righty.
4527120	4529560	Well I only live like 90 minutes from it so.
4529560	4533040	Nice well glad to hear you had a good time and hope to hear from you in the future don't
4533040	4534040	be a stranger.
4534040	4535040	All right see ya.
4535040	4536040	Take care buddy.
4536040	4537040	Thanks.
4537040	4541000	I feel bad because I'm making our callers wrap it up but you know we got I know there's
4541000	4547080	still a bunch of people that want to call in so we'll take maybe two more calls 1-877-GAME-OLR
4547080	4555760	or our username on skype orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call.
4555760	4559080	I will open it up for some oh never mind we're getting a call.
4559080	4564520	Hi on orange launch radio who's this?
4564520	4568920	Hi you are on orange launch radio who's this?
4568920	4569920	We cannot hear you.
4569920	4572920	Hola bienvenidos a orange launch radio.
4572920	4573920	Quienes.
4573920	4577560	Did you say Guiness?
4577560	4584040	What the crap is hi hi hi were you not expecting to get through?
4584040	4585880	No I didn't plug my mic in.
4585880	4589040	Oh well good job DMN.
4589040	4593080	Well hi DMN what's on your mind now that we can actually hear you?
4593080	4598800	I am actually calling in response to one of the long emails dark sakura or soccer sorry
4598800	4603760	had about Nintendo and ignorance and the Nintendo 64.
4603760	4605960	Goody goody what do you have to say?
4605960	4612000	Do any of you have any idea as to why Nintendo is still around?
4612000	4616040	Mario no handheld.
4616040	4621920	Because of their involvement still in the Hanafuda card business.
4621920	4627080	That's exactly it Jamie no Pokemon.
4627080	4633600	That game has sold well over 14 to 15 million copies and that's just the originals alone.
4633600	4635920	That's the reason why Nintendo is still in business.
4635920	4641660	Had that game not have sold on America's Nintendo would be kaput.
4641660	4648800	So the Nintendo 64 tanked let's all admit that it tanked it wasn't that great a system.
4648800	4653240	Nintendo lost a lot of money on it and they didn't do that great on the gamecube either.
4653240	4657600	They're just now rebounding back with the DS and the Wii.
4657600	4664560	So saying that you know the Nintendo 64 kept it in their forum no.
4664560	4669560	Did it have games I personally enjoyed yes but I don't think it was that successful of
4669560	4670560	a system.
4670560	4674000	We threw two bees our last caller's back in chat and says Nintendo sells at profit that's
4674000	4675800	why they're still around.
4675800	4681440	That too I mean the gamecube from its inception sold profit the Wii since its inception has
4681440	4688600	sold at profit the DS even if both models have sold at profit.
4688600	4693720	So Nintendo has knows what they're doing with hardware that's why they're still in it.
4693720	4700320	And like I said earlier Pokemon snap is the shit so you know Pokemon for the win.
4700320	4706240	Alright any other thoughts for our listeners tonight DMN?
4706240	4712680	Oh man oh Guitar Hero 3 massively multiplayer thon that I talked about on my show I want
4712680	4714040	to pitch that really quick.
4714040	4715040	What's this?
4715040	4721600	If you are an OLR fanboy listener on air talent get together on Xbox live or on a Nintendo
4721600	4728160	Wi-Fi connection this Saturday I believe it's November the 9th and get together play with
4728160	4733320	some fellow OLR listeners and have some fun because Guitar Hero 3 is a very fun game especially
4733320	4734660	on multiplayer this time around.
4734660	4737560	Or you could join our band on the website.
4737560	4740120	That too I did I joined it like just now.
4740120	4745560	Oh I see your request I'm going to go in and approve it right now.
4745560	4747920	I'm working on that right now as we talk.
4747920	4749000	He's clicking on the red x-rays.
4749000	4750000	I am.
4750000	4753040	Okay and now I'm going to click on the button that hangs up on you okay?
4753040	4754040	Okay.
4754040	4755840	Bye friend!
4755840	4758280	Alright let's get some last minute stories.
4758280	4762000	What's going on over to Loki with any last minute stories?
4762000	4763920	Oh Dark Sakura has one why don't you start us off then?
4763920	4764920	I do have one.
4764920	4771640	Do you remember how they were talking about the PS3 to help with the folding protein models?
4771640	4777640	Actually it did make the Guinness Book of World Records and they're saying that since
4777640	4788320	the project started they've been using 670,000 PlayStation 3s at they were actually according
4788320	4795240	to this it says the FAH is now the most powerful distributed computing network ever at over
4795240	4796240	a petaflop.
4796240	4801800	That sounds like something that would be on Dateline NBC a petaflop.
4801800	4807080	It's over 250 teraflops which is a trillion calculations per second.
4807080	4814440	So, they have been using the PS3 as a computer and the whole point of the folding project
4814440	4821400	is basically to look how proteins fold because they have evidence to show that proteins that
4821400	4827280	don't fold properly are related to Alzheimer's and other diseases.
4827280	4832120	The amazing things being accomplished with the PlayStation 3 what can we say?
4832120	4836120	And Rob with Two Bees asks in chat what's a microflop then?
4836120	4839360	That would be this episode.
4839360	4841400	Good point.
4841400	4842960	We're getting another call on the Skype line.
4842960	4843960	Let's go take it.
4843960	4844960	Hello.
4844960	4845960	You are on Orange Lawn's radio.
4845960	4846960	Who's this?
4846960	4847960	Hello.
4847960	4848960	It's Rice Princess.
4848960	4849960	Hi Rice Princess.
4849960	4850960	You're not here.
4850960	4851960	You're supposed to be here in studio tonight.
4851960	4852960	I totally was.
4852960	4853960	I'm sorry.
4853960	4854960	What gives?
4854960	4855960	I have a flat tire.
4855960	4856960	Fired.
4856960	4857960	I know.
4857960	4858960	I'm sorry.
4858960	4859960	Too cute.
4859960	4860960	All right.
4860960	4865120	Well, what's on your mind and put the mic a little closer to your mouth because you're
4865120	4866120	barely coming in.
4866120	4867120	This better.
4867120	4868120	Oh my gosh.
4868120	4869120	Is it louder?
4869120	4870120	Jesus Christ.
4870120	4871120	Yes.
4871120	4872120	All right.
4872120	4873120	Okay.
4873120	4874120	Much better.
4874120	4875120	What's on your mind?
4875120	4876120	What do you want to comment on tonight?
4876120	4877120	Oh, I don't know.
4877120	4878120	You told me to call in.
4878120	4879840	I told you to call in because you weren't here in person.
4879840	4881920	I just wanted to break you over the phone.
4881920	4882920	Oh, okay.
4882920	4883920	Shame on you.
4883920	4885280	Well, what have you been playing lately?
4885280	4886280	Anything?
4886280	4892640	I haven't been doing much game playing for the past couple of weeks.
4892640	4895560	You haven't been playing a lot of WoW or anything?
4895560	4896560	Not really.
4896560	4897560	Oh.
4897560	4898560	Well, gee.
4898560	4901480	A video game podcaster does you a lot of good this week, doesn't it?
4901480	4902480	Doesn't it though?
4902480	4903480	My gosh.
4903480	4904880	I've been playing so little.
4904880	4907400	Like it's kind of pointless for me to be calling in.
4907400	4908400	All right.
4908400	4909400	Well, then I'll hang up on you.
4909400	4910400	What?
4910400	4911400	I'll hang up on you then.
4911400	4912400	Hey, jerk.
4912400	4913400	You told me to call in.
4913400	4916400	Well, because I thought you'd want to say hi because you weren't here in person.
4916400	4917400	Oh, well, hi.
4917400	4918400	All right.
4918400	4919400	Bye.
4919400	4920400	All right.
4920400	4921400	1-877.
4921400	4924400	I'm going to get spanked for that one later.
4924400	4927800	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLawnsRadio.
4927800	4929160	Loki, got anything for us real quick?
4929160	4932240	We'll take one more call.
4932240	4937120	Circuit City is offering a pretty cool deal for people that purchase Call of Duty 4.
4937120	4941120	Yay, Call of Duty 3 for free.
4941120	4942120	That's for...
4942120	4944200	Because you probably already own it.
4944200	4945200	Hey, it's free.
4945200	4947360	Because you wouldn't want to play it.
4947360	4951360	It's free and also been leaked to the internet from what I've seen.
4951360	4958200	Sensible Soccer or Sensible World of Soccer is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade
4958200	4964120	this month, also coming out on the PSC.
4964120	4965120	That's neat.
4965120	4966120	Maybe.
4966120	4967120	You said the game is how old?
4967120	4968720	We're getting another call on Skype.
4968720	4971280	Let's go take that and then we'll get to any more last minute stories.
4971280	4972280	This will be our last call tonight.
4972280	4973280	Hi, you're on OrangeLawnsRadio.
4973280	4974280	Who's this?
4974280	4976280	Hey, it's ShadowNextGen.
4976280	4977920	Hello, ShadowNextGen.
4977920	4978920	What's on your mind?
4978920	4981160	How's it going?
4981160	4982480	Pretty good.
4982480	4984960	What did you want to talk about tonight?
4984960	4987840	E for All, briefly, because I was there.
4987840	4990160	How was E for All?
4990160	4994640	E for All, despite a lot of the internet reports, was actually a lot of fun.
4994640	4996200	There was a lot of games to play.
4996200	5000880	I mean, obviously, Microsoft and Sony weren't there and those were the big omissions, but
5000880	5010200	Metal Gear Solid 4, Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers, Contra 4, Call of Duty 4, Simpsons.
5010200	5012800	There was Guitar Hero 3, Rock Band.
5012800	5014720	There was quite a lot of games there to play.
5014720	5018440	The biggest complaint I heard about E for All was very similar to what Rob had just
5018440	5021920	said about Video Game Expo and that is you could have done it all in a day.
5021920	5024520	Is that true?
5024520	5028280	You probably could have, but I mean, I was there for the whole time.
5028280	5032120	There was also the Video Game Live concert that I went to that was a lot of fun as well.
5032120	5033120	Nice.
5033120	5034120	Sounds like fun.
5034120	5036540	That was right across the street from E for All.
5036540	5040880	Did you wait in line for Super Smash Brothers?
5040880	5046320	I didn't have to because I got in early, so I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.
5046320	5047320	Nice.
5047320	5048320	How was it?
5048320	5050160	Super Smash Brothers was a lot of fun.
5050160	5056280	I believe I played as Link and they had a level from Twilight Princess in there.
5056280	5062440	They had the bridge level where you're jousting with that big enemy on the Warthog.
5062440	5063880	So it was a lot of fun.
5063880	5068000	Do you think this game has the potential to be OMG Best Game Ever?
5068000	5073480	With all the new stuff that they're putting in, it could very well be with the level editor
5073480	5079640	and the video record feature and it seems like every week they keep adding new features.
5079640	5080640	Sounds pretty hot.
5080640	5083260	I know I'm excited about it.
5083260	5086840	And then I got to try the Wii Zapper I actually had fun with.
5086840	5089520	Ah yes, the Wii Zapper.
5089520	5091160	That's going to be coming out pretty soon, huh?
5091160	5094360	They had Link's crossbow training there, which was pretty good, especially if you're a Zelda
5094360	5095360	fan.
5095360	5101320	I have a copy unordered because I've saved myself from purchasing other Wii games.
5101320	5106160	I'm very excited to finally put the Wii Zapper bet to rest because we still have that going
5106160	5107160	on too.
5107160	5108160	I will kick your ass.
5108160	5109160	The date bet.
5109160	5112160	So anyway, we'll worry about that later.
5112160	5115040	Mario Party DS was there, that was also a lot of fun.
5115040	5120160	Oh yeah, I saw Mario Party 8 this weekend I forgot to mention.
5120160	5121560	I saw it, I didn't play it.
5121560	5123600	Because it was another Wii game that came out at the party.
5123600	5125600	It's just another Mario Party game.
5125600	5127600	I got it from my brother when I got him his Wii for the first time.
5127600	5131080	But now you build hotels I guess or something, whatever.
5131080	5133280	One of the maps has hotels on it or something.
5133280	5135280	Anyway, sorry ShoutOutNextGen.
5135280	5139080	What else is on your mind, buddy?
5139080	5144040	I just wanted to say that E4ALL wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of the reports were making
5144040	5145040	it out to be.
5145040	5150800	They had about 18,000 people there I think they said, which is almost about a third of
5150800	5152600	what E3 used to draw.
5152600	5156520	I would say that's pretty good for a first year without Sony and Microsoft there.
5156520	5160200	Well I'm glad to hear a dissenting opinion from someone who is actually there, we welcome
5160200	5161200	that.
5161200	5163680	What do you think though about next year, because apparently they have it timed where
5163680	5166760	it's going to be very close to Penny Arcade Expo next year.
5166760	5171880	Do you think that's going to be a good thing or bad or what?
5171880	5176280	I think now I don't really see it being too good of a move because Penny Arcade is starting
5176280	5178200	to get really huge.
5178200	5184400	I don't know why they would want to draw away more potential exhibitors who would probably
5184400	5185840	rather go up to Seattle.
5185840	5188480	Yeah, it's going to be interesting.
5188480	5190120	Walk the wait and see.
5190120	5193800	Hopefully they'll smarten up and either they'll put it in October again or they'll put it
5193800	5195260	earlier in the year.
5195260	5198480	They might be playing a game of chicken right now to see if anybody backs down first, but
5198480	5199480	we will see.
5199480	5201240	Anyway, ShoutOutNextGen, we've got to let you go.
5201240	5204080	We're going to try to wrap things up for tonight, but thanks so much for your call.
5204080	5206200	All right, have a good night guys.
5206200	5207200	All right, you too.
5207200	5212080	It's good to hear from somebody who's actually there as opposed to all the hearsay on the
5212080	5213080	internet.
5213080	5215080	I'm so sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.
5215080	5219240	I know we have more people that wanted to call in, but sadly we've got to get this show
5219240	5222800	wrapped up because we are going on a three-hour program tonight and we've got to wrap this
5222800	5223800	shit up.
5223800	5226400	So, Loke, did you have anything else for last minute stories?
5226400	5231120	Yeah, real quick, I was going to say Heavenly Stars is going to be in No More Heroes as
5231120	5236640	well, as a song apparently, and I don't know, it should be pretty interesting.
5236640	5241720	I guess you find a hidden VHS tape in the game or something.
5241720	5244320	Well, it's kind of weird.
5244320	5248860	Then let's see here, I laughed when I read this story.
5248860	5253920	Apparently there were going to do some Assassin's Creed novels that were going to come out around
5253920	5256820	the same time as the game.
5256820	5266360	But apparently a sect of real-life assassins paid Ubisoft a visit and told them no.
5266360	5268080	I don't know.
5268080	5270240	I laughed at that.
5270240	5276720	Then there was an interview with Naughty Dog about Uncharted where they said that they've
5276720	5281400	only used 30% of the PS3's power for Uncharted.
5281400	5285320	So if the game sucks, that's why.
5285320	5287800	Let's see here.
5287800	5295120	And then finally, Nintendo was also, the PR manager with Nintendo was interviewed regarding
5295120	5299840	a couple things including a hard drive and friend codes.
5299840	5305640	Eric Walter, of course, revealed no plans for a Wii hard drive despite the fact that
5305640	5309000	the whole WiiWare service is going to be coming.
5309000	5318180	And also as far as the friend's codes, apparently they've pulled people through different questionnaires
5318180	5324800	and whatnot and people don't seem to be, they are undisturbed by them so they're going to
5324800	5325800	stay.
5325800	5326800	Hooray!
5326800	5332040	I do want to add to the last minute news to follow up to our breaking news earlier.
5332040	5334000	The character battle is over and it's official.
5334000	5337800	L-Block is the new champion after the character battle.
5337800	5343640	And now they're having an extra bonus round and today the L-Block is facing off against
5343640	5351000	the paddle, the question mark block, and the weighted companion cube that's doing battles.
5351000	5354760	I can already tell the weighted companion cube is going to win just because it's current.
5354760	5359760	Actually, at the current time, now it is early on in the race, but at the current time L-Block
5359760	5362720	is leading with almost 40% of the vote.
5362720	5366520	Weighted companion cube is in second place but only with 27% of the vote.
5366520	5367520	That'll change.
5367520	5370560	The portal jokes are going to get old pretty soon, you guys.
5370560	5371560	Alright.
5371560	5375200	Anyhow, show is over, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5375200	5378400	We'll start off with Puppy, thank you so much for being here and I'm glad you got to actually
5378400	5379400	talk this time.
5379400	5380400	Yay!
5380400	5385160	So what is your final thought?
5385160	5387880	I have cavities now from all this damn candy.
5387880	5390040	I know, I need an insulin shot, Jesus.
5390040	5392440	Alright, DarkSakura, your final thought?
5392440	5395640	I fucking love my iPhone.
5395640	5401120	And my final thought is, I'm going to have a candy coma.
5401120	5403360	Loki, your final thought?
5403360	5407920	My final thought is I have way too many games to play this week and I hope my Wii works.
5407920	5408920	Alright.
5408920	5409920	Wii console.
5409920	5410920	Thank you guys so much.
5410920	5411920	I'm not worried about my Wii.
5411920	5413920	I know that works just fine.
5413920	5414920	Okay.
5414920	5418000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Launch Radio and supporting
5418000	5419040	Independent Radio.
5419040	5423560	If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show or go leave us a nice
5423560	5428280	review on iTunes, dang it, because we could always use some extra five-star reviews because
5428280	5434000	that helps spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.
5434000	5436680	We don't have any of those fancy magazines.
5436680	5437680	That's right.
5437680	5440080	We don't have any of that fancy-shmancy stuff to back us up.
5440080	5442240	We do this because we love you all.
5442240	5443360	Expensive print material.
5443360	5445240	So we appreciate it.
5445240	5450360	So you like one of those fancy magazines, you find it at Kmart.
5450360	5451360	Sorry.
5451360	5458280	Alright, on that note, until next week, I'm Rob, that's Jamie, that's Loki, and we're
5458280	5459400	Orange Launch Radio.
5459400	5481940	See you next week.
5481940	5490620	Bye-bye.
