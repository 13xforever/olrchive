20523	21224	Ultimate Quest Ultimate Quest
38958	42079	You've probably heard FootyMonster, maybe Xenocore, call in this show.
42119	46299	Well, they are hosts on another show over at All Games, and it's called Ultimate Quest.
46860	48220	And that show should be out this week.
48260	52701	I think they said Monday night or Tuesday afternoon-ish, so check them out at UltimateQuest.net.
52981	64943	We had a conversation about MMOs, and I was kind of like the guy there that played WoW on Final Fantasy XI, but it was a good panel because they had another guy that was like City of Heroes, and a couple were playing EVE Online, and
65642	67362	Lots of different MMOs being talked about.
67402	70583	We were kind of talking about societies and getting into a pretty in-depth discussion.
70963	71543	Good times.
71783	72263	I approve.
72524	75164	So thanks to the kids at Ultimate Quest for having me on their program.
75904	77045	Now we can get back into some gaming news.
77445	83326	Alright, so Super Mario Galaxy of course is coming out not next week, but the week after next.
84066	90227	And, you know, it's been revealed that there's going to be a certain hidden playable character in the game.
91308	92948	Apparently, when you...
95084	96686	All 120 stars in the game.
96726	98327	Complete all the purple coin missions.
98867	100629	Defeated Bowser a second time.
102491	103692	You can play as Luigi.
104552	107215	And actually, Luigi, he will jump higher and further.
107415	109577	Also runs faster, but has trouble stopping.
109857	111939	And says otherwise they have the same moves.
112740	114061	Luigi needs new sneakers!
114081	115642	At least it's not, you know, Luigi's Mansion.
115662	116102	Hmm.
136994	141155	Yeah, that would be, I'm glad it's not, you know, Luigi's Mansion embedded in the game.
141595	144116	Although, I don't know, part of me thinks Luigi's Mansion got a bad rap.
144556	144856	I don't know.
145136	148777	I actually liked Luigi's Mansion until it got to the baby part, and then the baby part kind of creeped me out.
149918	150138	Really?
150238	152198	Well, I thought you liked scary video games, though.
153359	157520	There's a difference between stupid scary and, like, I like Silent Hill.
158060	158900	I like Resident Evil.
159381	160901	Mental screwing with your mind's scary.
162023	168930	Well, thanks to the ESRB ratings, some new games have been leaked for upcoming US Virtual Console releases.
170331	179541	Alien Soldier is one of the games that is going to be coming to Virtual Console soon, as well as Shining Force 2 and Bubble Bobble will be coming to Virtual Console.
179841	185787	And it is assumed that they have worked it out so that you can get past level 30 in the Virtual Console release of
187008	188169	GoNintendo had a voicemail from...
203510	204551	Mario himself.
204831	205572	Charles Martinet.
205652	205932	Yes.
207213	208654	Announcing Super Mario Bros.
209054	211056	3 will be out tomorrow.
211756	212797	I love Super Mario Bros.
213017	212797	3.
213137	214318	Mario 3 is fucking rad.
214358	216620	I love playing through Mario 3 and not using Warp Zones.
216800	217941	Because I love Giant World.
218301	219162	Who doesn't love Giant World?
219402	220703	Giant World's the best, but you know what?
220743	222885	My favorite is going in on Kuriboh's shoe.
223946	226248	There's only like one level in the whole game where you do that, huh?
226268	227929	It's not even a mandatory level, is it?
228209	232232	But with the Game Genie code back in the day, you could keep the shoe through other levels.
232913	233213	Awesome.
233829	236290	Which sort of made it stupid for the ones you have to fly to get shit though.
237271	240553	Now all you need is to actually be able to play this game online.
241833	246296	Like imagine if you could be Mario and play against a Luigi that's millions of miles away.
246616	247656	You know that's not going to happen.
248737	249277	It should.
250558	251038	But will it?
251738	252219	I don't know.
253279	257582	Anyway, for UK Virtual Console we've got some fun stuff.
258122	262124	Sonic 3D Flicky's Island for 800 Wii Points will be out.
263391	268355	Um, the Sonic 3D games were sort of interesting.
270196	275040	They weren't really, really 3D, just sort of 3D, but anyway.
275500	276621	I can't believe it's not 3D.
276981	278463	Yeah, I can't believe it's not 3D, exactly.
280044	291953	And then, um, we also have, uh, as soon as it loads, Samurai Ghost, which was a TurboGrafx-16 game, um, which is a side-scrolling, you know, slash-
292793	296034	Fighter, Shooter, you know, guy with a sword game.
297874	300535	And I think it's funny.
300955	306776	The whole purpose of the game, according to the opening screen, is it's an order from the King of Heaven.
307976	310577	And then we have Art of Fighting, Neo Geo.
311437	316638	I don't need to say anything more about Art of Fighting because that's the game that gave us... King.
317138	322499	No, well, besides King, it gave us the two characters that spawned the introduction of Dan Hibiki.
323220	326603	in the Street Fighter series, which would be Ryo and Robert Garcia.
326623	330346	Was Dan supposed to be like a parody of them or something?
330406	330947	Yes, he was.
331027	331507	How funny.
331547	334670	Because Ryo was like a Ryu knockoff.
335831	345559	And Robert Garcia had, I guess, he had some other moves, so they actually combined the two characters into, you know, Mr. Sucktastic Godoken.
346220	347100	So I thought it was great.
347261	347961	And again, keep in mind,
349577	350917	Dan's like one of my favorite characters.
351258	355999	Especially in Puzzle Fighter, because you have to be really freaking good to beat people in Puzzle Fighter using Dan.
356639	357720	Because he drops all red blocks.
358320	360080	So you have to drop a lot really fast.
360180	361561	Yeah, you have to be really good.
361621	364582	And I can proudly say that I've beaten somebody using Devilot.
364922	368583	Or pray that a red break gem never falls.
369123	369804	Seriously.
370404	373425	But, you know, I digress.
373965	375025	Which is the whole point of the show.
375245	375705	Digression.
377046	377346	Awesome.
381744	382585	Ah, anyways.
383765	387667	So, you know, we don't really talk too much about Atari.
389748	393290	Well, they don't give us a lot that's worth talking about anymore.
393390	399113	In case you haven't heard, you know, Atari, they have not too many licensed games out there.
399133	402835	I mean, I think the last few licensed games haven't been that great.
403336	407638	You know, what with the, they used to have the Driver series.
408297	409618	Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi
432463	438965	It's kind of sad to see because really all that they're going to be left after this is gone is pretty much Alone in the Dark.
440786	441306	You know what?
443687	444787	This is what I have to say.
444847	445887	First of all, two things.
446067	447948	One about Dragon Ball Z and one about Atari.
448408	452329	Dragon Ball Z has been off the air in Japan when I graduated college.
452349	455490	Well, I didn't graduate college, but when I was out of high school.
456591	458991	No, I take that back because I had an episode taped off the TV.
459351	460792	Okay, the series ended.
461792	462513	Dragon Ball GT Dragon Ball GT
489693	493034	But it still doesn't mean it's not even old over here.
493214	495095	It's still old.
495155	496755	The whole thing is saturated.
496815	498516	And that and Atari, oh my god.
499776	505538	Actdeft says in our chatroom, chat.orange.com, Actdeft says, Atari, doing nothing since the 1980s.
506139	515462	And to tell Ranma, Dragon Ball GT, in my opinion, does kind of count because it was going back to the original flair of what Dragon Ball was.
516402	518583	But Dragon Ball Z was better.
518603	518683	Okay.
519514	520695	Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkai G3 Godzilla Unleashed
543874	546576	and Jenga on the Wii and the DS.
546716	549758	I remember reporting on this game when it was first announced.
550259	552260	We were like, the fuck?
552420	554062	Can't you just play, like, real Jenga?
554082	556403	Which I believe they did at Penny Arcade Expo.
556443	557464	They played real Jenga.
558044	563488	And to be honest, then they also have another, like, classic compilation game coming to the PSP.
563508	565030	Because that's all that ever comes out on the PSP.
566911	567291	That's it.
567571	568692	That's all they have coming out of this year.
568712	569513	And then Lone Dark...
570842	573064	Dragon Ball Z was replaced by Brioni Kenshin.
591434	592875	Rurouni Kenshin was replaced by Naruto.
592995	594636	And now Bleach is doing its damnedest.
594956	597178	So that's the transition I'd like to point out.
597218	599999	And seriously, companies, stop making so many Naruto games.
600019	601560	I mean, there's like five every year.
602661	604202	Seriously, we don't need that many Naruto games.
604222	607304	I think I have like a stack of them in our vault collecting dust.
609305	609805	In the vault.
611466	612747	No, it really is the vault.
612967	615108	It's a whole room dedicated to my video game collection.
615489	615789	All right.
616351	629415	Well, anyhow, you know, they say imitation is the finest form of flattery, but I don't know about this one, because apparently there is now, Walmart is now selling these little knockoff Wiimotes.
630075	639558	It's a device made by ToyQuest, and what it is, it basically looks like a Wiimote, but it has a little LCD screen on the Wiimote.
642178	644339	And you actually can play tennis...
645276	646736	with this Wiimote.
647576	653938	It's a little tiny LCD screen, but I don't even think it has motion control or whatever because the screen is so fucking tiny.
653998	655298	It would be hilarious if it did.
655338	655978	How would you see it?
656438	658918	I'll swing it and then, oh shit.
658958	659259	You know what?
659439	663839	Someone needs to hack it to be a VMU emulator and put a chow on there.
664039	666480	Seriously, these things cost under $20.
666520	668960	I want to say it said it was like $7 for this thing.
669980	672081	That might be too much for this.
672201	672861	I don't know about that.
674861	680225	Quality People should give crappy useless toys to the bad children instead of coal Because you can actually use coal
702270	704833	This is what you get for being a bad kid.
705334	710661	Is that like driving kids by a burned out factory telling them that Disneyland burned down or something?
710941	712403	No, that was deep thought.
712503	713304	I know that was deep thought.
713324	714225	It was jack handy.
716148	719252	Anyhow, so yeah, those are kind of stupid.
719612	720153	And you know what?
721959	730888	These types of things and these knockoffs and these unoriginal bastards and tiny little LCD screens that try to pass for a game, these things just piss us off and it makes us angsty.
731428	733010	And when we get mad, people die.
733490	735432	Or at least the FUs of the week are unleashed.
753982	758263	F you goes towards the digestion problems I inherited from my mother.
758963	760384	Mom, fuck your genes.
761644	762505	I mean, I love you.
763685	764605	And her birthday's tomorrow.
764825	766266	So happy birthday to my mom, who will be 48.
766666	768026	Happy birthday, Jamie's mom.
770007	774408	But anyway, yeah, everything I eat really makes me sick.
774868	776729	So I'm just going to stop eating altogether.
777889	779510	Except for couscous.
781560	798629	FU to Saints Row for not allowing you to change what your character looks like when you're playing system-linked multiplayer.
799089	803612	So everybody looks like the same dude wearing the same black t-shirt and the same jeans.
804395	804595	F.U.
804635	808018	to the bruise on my leg that still kinda hurts this week but at least it's getting a little better
829471	831573	Maybe I can roll my pants up far enough I can show you one cat.
831613	832313	Actually, I probably can't.
832333	833214	My bruise is like in here.
833234	834395	I can't roll my pants up that far.
834755	838719	I might be a little too much skin for Operator 11, so no show for you.
838739	839960	I was going to say one more thing real quick.
840040	840240	What?
840580	844343	My cat tried to perform like a level 3 execution on my wife's legs.
844443	846745	You know, Manhunt 2 reference.
846985	847326	Oh, okay.
847346	850368	She attacked her leg with her back claw and it like sliced it.
850388	852850	It looked like she was trying to like cut her leg off or something.
853290	853891	Holy kitty.
854271	857454	But, you know, without... It was the cutest level 3 execution ever.
859537	860498	That's it, my F.U.
860518	861959	just went to my bruise on my leg.
862260	864321	So at least I don't have to have the band-aid on it anymore.
864682	865002	Puppy!
866203	866604	My F.U.
866624	872629	goes to your neighborhood for there being no street lights and street signs covered by trees.
873490	876853	Because I almost got lost getting here because I couldn't read anything.
878414	884340	Yeah, I like followed him all the way from like the big main road over and I was like, hey, I bet that's Puppy.
884684	887746	because I saw the college sticker on your car.
888186	890508	And then I was like, he went right past Rob's street.
890928	892849	I almost went right past Rob's street.
892949	894950	It is kind of, yeah, they don't really have streetlights here.
895110	897452	They didn't invent them yet, I guess, when these houses were built.
897472	897832	What can I say?
897852	898532	It's rural.
899093	908899	And F you to the housing market because I got scared a little bit and when half the people that I work with at my company got laid off this week.
909659	910019	D'oh.
911220	912581	No, well, I work for a...
913567	919628	I do drafting work for a carpenter, and they just laid off a bunch of their foremen.
921229	922229	I hope I get laid off.
923509	929790	No, seriously, because if I get laid off, I get like three months of severance pay and can collect unemployment while I start my massage business.
930630	931611	That'd be fantastic.
932971	933311	Awesome.
933591	934271	That would be nice.
935691	936412	Nice little cushion.
937192	939692	Alright, well that's going to do it for our FUs of the week.
941013	943193	Let's get back into some gaming news, shall we?
944424	945204	Shall we?
945645	946725	We shall.
947065	948486	DarkSakura, why don't you take it away?
948826	949466	I don't wanna.
949766	950427	You gotta.
951367	951767	Why?
951827	952908	Because I said so.
953168	954328	Okay, fine.
955008	962111	For anyone who follows the Child's Play charity, the 5th annual Child's Play charity drive is beginning.
964332	973736	Basically, it was the whole charity was the brainchild of the Penny Arcade Powers That Be
974563	979585	and is now basically the gaming community's way of giving to those in need.
980345	984887	For children who are in hospitals in 25 states and 5 countries.
985327	992269	So you can donate your items through Amazon and it is considered a tax-deductible gift.
992889	995770	So keep that in mind if you have those deductions coming up.
996730	998151	The drive... Sorry.
999202	1005506	Their fundraiser dinner, I apologize, is set to take place on December 11th at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle.
1006227	1007828	So go play.
1008769	1010370	Get the brainstorming, folks.
1010430	1015134	We need to think of what we here at OLR can do to help out this lovely charity that gives gamers a good name.
1015234	1018556	So we'll have to think of something we can donate or a fundraiser we can do.
1019417	1021799	Maybe we'll have a ditter-thon, a DDR-thon.
1021819	1022539	Wouldn't that be fun?
1023500	1024060	Okay, maybe not.
1025061	1025622	You never know.
1026282	1026702	You never know.
1026802	1027463	We'll think of something.
1028231	1033493	So, one awesome game that's coming out this year has gone gold, and that would be Crysis.
1034313	1039254	It's due out November 16th, so I hope you have your new PC by now, because you're going to need it.
1039695	1043236	And, of course, it'll be the first game to utilize the CryEngine 2.
1044596	1046857	No, that's not the same engine used in Yaris.
1046897	1048297	That's a different CryEngine.
1050138	1053459	And, of course, hopefully it'll be coming to consoles soon.
1053499	1056980	There is a single-player demo that's available now, which...
1057745	1066348	Hackers have gone ahead and poked their noses through some of the DirectX workaround codes inside there.
1067148	1071830	And they've found stuff like hidden weapons, vehicles, and bad guys from the full version.
1071910	1081373	So now, with a little bit of cutting and pasting, they're able to play with every gun in the game, as well as tanks and attack chopper.
1082254	1083154	Sounds like how I play games.
1083174	1084014	Yeah, it does.
1084094	1085915	All the guns, a tank, and an attack chopper.
1086618	1092201	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1112488	1115670	So it's kind of like Think Sam and Max, but like really, really long.
1115970	1120492	It's going to start in 2008 in the spring, and they're already running the ads on it.
1120992	1125794	And the little quote from the ad says, And of course, you know, American McGee did that Alice in Wonderland game that was, you know, pretty fucked.
1139559	1143001	I'm sure you're going to see lots of your fairy tales done the right way.
1143361	1145782	Dark and gory, the way they were originally.
1147343	1153186	I will be looking forward to, I imagine this is going to have to be in it, the Hansel and Gretel, because I can't wait to push the witch in the oven.
1154007	1154507	That'll be fun.
1156388	1158749	The original fairy tales were all kinds of messed up.
1159129	1160730	I mean, who would read that to their children?
1161856	1162156	I would.
1163497	1168139	I would like to see... My mom handed me the book and said, go read it and don't come bother me until you finish this chapter.
1168279	1173681	I would like to see the Grimm fairy tales done by Sam and Max because I think that would be awesome.
1174982	1175902	That would be kind of fun.
1178223	1178524	Anyways.
1179064	1183086	Sony is going to be doing an animated Resident Evil movie.
1184346	1186327	It's actually a CG animation.
1186747	1189669	They're calling it Biohazard Degeneration in Japan.
1189949	1190129	So...
1192590	1200235	There's a presumption that it's going to be called Resident Evil Finding Necro over here, which is kind of a dumb name.
1200275	1204198	They said it's going to have groundbreaking visual effects and a brand new storyline.
1204478	1206799	So, oh well, we'll see.
1208841	1209401	It's supposed to be out in 2008.
1209701	1210982	Nah, we won't see.
1211142	1211963	I don't really want to see it.
1213124	1216866	I mean, I'm kind of over Resident Evil like 10 years ago.
1216906	1218628	I liked the last movie.
1219869	1220469	Well, I did.
1221072	1231317	If you're over Resident Evil, perhaps you may be interested in a few other films that are coming, including Onimusha, which is starting production in April.
1232517	1238460	Apparently they also have a poster now revealed for the Tekken movie.
1239159	1241881	Which the poster looks stupid, I might add.
1242202	1245364	It's a giant T that looks like it's being held up.
1245404	1246485	T for Tekken!
1246765	1248127	Wow, it's creative.
1248167	1250589	Yay!
1250629	1252410	It's already down the road of DOA.
1254031	1256133	It's apparently the Onimusha... Dead on arrival.
1256473	1261177	The Onimusha adaption, of course, is expected to begin April of 2008.
1262238	1265901	And, of course, Silent Hill director Christopher Gans is going to be at the helm.
1265921	1268003	Well, that may not suck.
1270564	1296797	may not and unfortunately the Tekken poster if I were to sum up the movie based on the poster I would say suck and how many times based on the poster I'd be all where's Big Bird to tell me this episode was brought to you by the letter T and the number 69 and how many times have fighting games made good movies
1298757	1301358	Hey, I remember the Tekken anime that came out.
1302579	1305200	Well, animes are usually better than movies anyways.
1305660	1315164	The Tekken anime, my problem with that is that it was all completely done on computer, and I prefer cell animation, so that's what was bad about that.
1317025	1318825	That also had a lot of butt rock in it.
1321867	1322767	Yeah, the US one.
1323240	1323901	Video Games Becoming Movies
1332614	1333875	Pirates of the Caribbean
1361129	1364031	That probably means you can't actually type your own sentences.
1364431	1370374	You have to make things from the pre-rendered things that are in there because we have to keep our children safe because these are Disney games.
1370454	1372495	Like using the Final Fantasy XI macros?
1372815	1373956	I don't know that for sure.
1374176	1374997	Don't quote me on that.
1375017	1376277	I don't know if that's the case in this game.
1376317	1379899	I don't know if any of our chatters have played it, but I just know in Toontown that was the case.
1379959	1382801	I had a friend that played Toontown for a long-ass time, actually.
1384242	1387683	Pirates of the Caribbean, I wouldn't mind checking this out.
1388044	1390645	I would check it out, but Puzzle Pirates would probably still be better.
1391314	1391654	Maybe.
1392174	1397197	You know, and plus, my fondness for Pirates of the Caribbean is the ride, not the movie.
1397257	1402640	I know that might be like blasphemy to some people, but I could care less about Johnny Depp.
1404301	1406322	Although he was a kind of cool addition to the ride.
1406722	1409704	And, you know, some of the other stuff they added on the ride.
1410004	1410244	Anyhow.
1411121	1411861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1441913	1442334	We will see.
1443335	1450441	Alright, well, um, we have one that says, Hey guys, I was wondering if you could recommend some older 360 games that might be worth picking up used.
1450802	1453604	I was thinking about PSU, but not sure if it was any good, thanks.
1453644	1455406	And this comes from Mark.
1456367	1459590	Um, PSU sucks, so don't play it.
1460431	1460511	Um,
1462372	1462812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1483487	1488411	You can also play the offline version for free, so, I mean, don't necessarily think you have to play it online.
1488471	1490593	Plus, the expansion's coming out here pretty soon.
1491253	1497698	It should, they've already done a buttload of, my friend Julie, Casame19, she plays a butt ton.
1497898	1500420	She is always on that fucking game whenever I'm on live.
1500720	1502221	She does nothing but play that game.
1502402	1503022	Wow, amazing.
1503042	1505244	So, she's like, that's her Evercrack.
1505784	1510668	Tips from the chatroom, Rob with two B's is mentioning Circuit City has PSU on the cheap.
1511405	1512345	So if you are interested in that.
1512625	1514046	Some other folks are recommending some games.
1514186	1515947	Actdeft recommending Condemned.
1516347	1518128	DMN recommending Crackdown.
1519228	1520889	Crackdown is the I like jumping game.
1521269	1524070	I recommend staying the hell away from Perfect Dark Zero, first off.
1524610	1525770	I liked Perfect Dark Zero.
1526811	1529752	But I would suggest Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
1530312	1533013	To me, that is the best 360 title.
1533053	1533453	Burnout.
1536996	1538757	Okay, I do like Cache.
1539097	1540817	Even if it is an old game with souped up graphics.
1541037	1542318	Or how about Test Drive Unlimited?
1542598	1544298	That was a good game that I think was... How about No?
1544338	1546799	How about Kiss My Butt?
1547219	1550961	If you want some older games that have dropped in price, Dead Rising.
1551241	1553021	Yeah, Dead Rising is a good one.
1553061	1554001	If you can find that.
1554622	1557243	Actually, Far Cry Instinct's Predator wasn't that bad.
1557663	1558943	I thought you said good games.
1561064	1563585	And then I would also say probably...
1566946	1568427	Not Prey, that's for sure.
1568608	1571871	Definitely not Chromehounds.
1572571	1574113	Prey was like Ghetto Portal.
1575254	1578217	But I wouldn't buy Burnout, because there's a new Burnout game coming out in January.
1580419	1588066	I would say probably... Okay, we've given enough suggestions.
1588146	1592010	It's not that old, but Oblivion is also really good for a solo game.
1594660	1596621	We have an email from another Mark.
1596801	1597921	Your suggestion quota is up.
1598642	1598982	Hi Mark.
1599022	1599882	Hi, it's amazing.
1599922	1602983	My brother and I were talking about Count Dekula, but we couldn't remember the name.
1603423	1605004	We also loved You Can't Do That on Television.
1605164	1605504	Barf.
1606484	1608745	About Loki's a few of the week to women.
1609466	1611106	If you haven't learned by now, you will.
1611486	1613747	You as a male will always lose arguments against women.
1614507	1615688	I didn't believe it when people told me.
1615708	1616208	True statement.
1616388	1617028	But it's true.
1617288	1620410	Men are from Mars and women have already invaded it and destroyed all that are holy.
1620590	1621330	Of course we have.
1622076	1623057	because we're excellent.
1624359	1628505	So I'm trying to find more short ones because we've got a couple of long ones.
1630688	1636496	Hold on because I'm trying to load a little something for that last emailer because I played the You Can't Do That
1637552	1647396	Castle Ducula, home for many centuries to a dreadful dynasty of vicious- Tell me you would not play a fucking video game based on this.
1647416	1649617	This would be awesome.
1650237	1656859	Legend has it that these foul beings can be destroyed by a snake through the heart, or exposure to sunlight.
1657240	1660821	This does not suffice, however, for they may be brought back to life.
1661461	1664062	I apologize, the audio is so low.
1664402	1669183	Once a century, when the moon is in the eighth house, we will be blood.
1669423	1674864	The latest reincarnation did not run according to plan.
1676424	1677544	Oh, it's ketchup.
1677584	1680245	Here's the techno part, yes.
1680805	1685306	In the Vampire Hall of Fame, yeah, there's no vampires any other.
1685326	1687066	Don't you, don't you hurt me.
1687086	1688647	Cause it's a vampire.
1699797	1703599	That's the most random opening.
1703779	1705220	Count Ducula.
1705300	1706040	Count Ducula.
1707481	1709562	For anyone who doesn't know, God, it's so loud.
1710442	1714364	Count Ducula was actually a character from Danger Mouse.
1715764	1715985	Awesome.
1716025	1717365	If anyone who ever watched Danger Mouse.
1718786	1723368	So the southern one says, the classic game of the week segment seems to be like obscure cult hit of the week.
1724228	1726689	It says, will you be featuring games that are a little more known to us?
1726790	1727610	I did Cyberbots.
1729062	1730383	Yeah, like everybody knows Cyberbots.
1730403	1731344	A lot of people know Cyberbots.
1731404	1731665	It's Kong.
1731725	1732045	It's Kong.
1747159	1748220	and maybe she'll feature it later.
1748320	1748621	I don't know.
1748701	1750162	I kind of like the obscurity for now.
1750563	1756469	Well, keep in mind that all of the classic games that I like are really the more obscure ones anyway.
1756990	1760634	So, of course, if I'm going to be picking out the games, I'm going to be picking out all the weird shit that I like.
1761355	1763137	You know, but I covered Fantasy Zone.
1763177	1764178	That's not obscure.
1764799	1765039	Yeah.
1765700	1768463	You know, okay, I'll do Guardian Legend.
1770894	1772635	Even that's kind of obscure for some people.
1772895	1774395	This is my favorite game.
1774475	1775596	I say do what you want.
1775876	1777076	You know, I'm going to do what I want.
1777096	1777336	That's right.
1777356	1778797	I'm going to do what I want.
1778877	1780418	I go to school and I kill people.
1780578	1781538	I run with gangs.
1784119	1786420	I digitally insert Jabba the Hutt back in Star Wars.
1786720	1787240	I do what I want.
1787300	1787740	I run with gangs.
1787760	1795383	But to be fair, I do like a good number of, I guess, more mainstream titles.
1795443	1797044	I won't do one of Colibri.
1798294	1798935	Neo Geo Pocket Color
1824233	1827257	and on the... No, just on the Geo Pocket Color.
1827277	1827917	You know what?
1828258	1828959	Don't bother defending.
1828979	1831281	Just say, I'm going to do what I want.
1831722	1834044	I'm saying how people can find these games easily.
1834165	1834525	Oh, okay.
1834605	1840572	So it did have a US release, so... Anyway, this one comes from J-Rod.
1840592	1841513	Hi, J-Rod.
1842190	1843371	Love the show you guys put on.
1843411	1845634	I really dig how the show is live.
1845974	1848697	I have two guitars on my PS2 with both Guitar Hero 1 and 2.
1848838	1854264	Now the problem is I don't have my PS2 anymore, but I do have a PS3, a 60 gig that can play the old PS2 games.
1854664	1859330	Apparently Sony and everyone else didn't bother to make an adapter to get the Guitar Hero controllers to work on the PS3.
1860333	1863214	I was wondering if any of you guys had any first-hand experiences.
1863634	1870177	Are you anyone who did with the aftermarket adapters out there and could give me a recommendation or review of any of them?
1870257	1871518	Thanks, and keep up the awesome show.
1871538	1873279	I think Pelican makes one that works.
1874419	1876480	There is an adapter out there I know that works.
1876700	1878661	I would bet money it causes a delay, though.
1879301	1879881	I don't think it did.
1879981	1880262	Really?
1880562	1880902	Yeah.
1880942	1883503	I know there's one that we did as a story a while back.
1883663	1885064	Luckily, I didn't actually bet the money.
1885864	1888065	That actually does work, so...
1889464	1890545	Xenocore in chatroom.
1890585	1892867	See, when we don't know, we can always rely on chatroom.
1893307	1895889	Xenocore in chat says, not true, I have the adapter.
1896089	1896629	So there you have it.
1897930	1898570	Whatever.
1898590	1900392	I don't know.
1901372	1902613	Well, also, I think that it was great.
1902773	1903874	Sony doesn't love you there.
1904554	1909217	I also think it's fantastic that it says this email is sponsored by the Olive Garden, home of the NeverEnding Salads.
1910078	1911259	I don't know why I find that funny.
1911319	1912019	Olive Garden.
1912360	1914081	Not for the salad, though.
1914141	1918904	OLR, I appreciate that you guys tell us the Japanese release dates, but I was wondering if you guys have any Japanese listeners.
1920038	1921419	and I guess this comes from Thomas.
1922079	1922680	I think we do.
1922900	1923861	I'm pretty sure we do.
1924521	1928043	When we check the stats, we do see quite a number of connections from Japan.
1928443	1930945	And we've gotten emails from listeners in Japan before too.
1931686	1935808	We've got people all over the world because we are cool that way.
1936529	1938490	So now for the really freaking long emails.
1938530	1939050	How about that?
1939931	1940511	Yay.
1940911	1942452	Really freaking long email segment.
1943913	1944894	Dear OLR,
1945931	1950993	Pointing to a letter that was sent to you last week, it really shames me that a fellow gamer can be so blatantly ignorant.
1951814	1958917	Has anyone ever considered the fact that one of the main reasons that Nintendo has managed to stay afloat for so long is because of its first party games?
1958997	1962678	Starting with the Nintendo 64, the graphics of the system sucked.
1963299	1973423	The audio play was horrible, but it still managed to give you a few of the great franchises that you and I loved, like Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and other well-known franchises, and bring them, though it still looked horrible...
1975902	1977302	and Bring Them, but it still looked horrible.
1977603	1979364	The GameCube may have been a different story.
1979424	1981225	In my opinion, the GameCube was a great system.
1981465	1987308	While not on par with that of the Xbox and PlayStation 2, it had excellent graphics and almost all games played in high frame rate.
1987989	1992751	Pardon me for being ignorant, but what Metroid game was on Nintendo 64?
1992811	1995393	I don't know.
1995433	1995813	It wasn't.
1996133	2001136	Because Prime was on... No, it was a big deal when Prime came out because it was OMGZ Metroid.
2001617	2001937	Okay.
2001957	2002417	Never mind.
2002997	2004078	Just to make sure I didn't miss anything.
2004326	2004686	Pokemon Snap, yo!
2004706	2005107	Pokemon Snap, yeah!
2005227	2006628	Okay, so, to continue with this,
2025926	2030013	It had excellent graphics and almost all games played in full frame rate.
2030513	2036622	It also brought your favorite franchise into beautiful 3D detail, but it would have been so much better if they had online play.
2036723	2040749	I wouldn't have even bought my GameCube if it didn't have a new Metroid game.
2042597	2049483	Nintendo's first party developers have managed to bring back our favorite franchises and make us love them that much more with each new title.
2049563	2056789	It's mainly because of the fact that Nintendo first party developers and the fact that they make such great games are the only reason that Nintendo managed this far.
2057550	2064936	Though I may not know everything, I just want to point out that these few details are far as it goes with Nintendo's first party games and developers.
2064976	2067238	Let's just hope that it doesn't repeat any past mistakes.
2067978	2071281	To the Yaris, this is a letter that was sent to the Xbox Live Arcade.
2071622	2072002	It said...
2072677	2075719	Dear Xbox Live Arcade, we have always had a great relationship.
2075839	2077820	The day I met you, you sent me Geometry Wars.
2078320	2079260	Now you send me Yaris.
2079280	2080581	Does this mean you're breaking up with me?
2080701	2081682	Sincerely, Anonymous.
2083563	2084003	Brilliance.
2085544	2085784	Winner.
2086004	2087144	Email of the week right there.
2088285	2089266	Well, I've got another long one.
2089706	2090386	This is the last one.
2090446	2092267	It's by DJ Dysentery.
2092627	2093448	Okay.
2094508	2095769	Best name ever.
2095789	2097590	You have died of dysentery.
2098382	2099983	I'm not wearing that shirt tonight, sadly.
2100023	2104186	I'm wearing my panda with the panda and crossbones instead of skull and crossbones.
2104206	2104486	Hi, OLR.
2104546	2105187	I love your show.
2105247	2105927	Y'all are amazing.
2105947	2106928	Do we have a southern guy?
2107028	2107428	Cool.
2108209	2111672	I listen to y'all everywhere I go and named my firstborn daughter Skye.
2113052	2113413	Wow.
2114233	2115774	Send the birth certificate as proof.
2115794	2116375	I don't believe it.
2116695	2117596	So on and so forth.
2117616	2118576	That's awesome.
2118937	2126302	To beat the proverbial dead horse, your qualms concerning the term microtransactions would give even Captain Jean-Luc Picard a headache of massive proportions.
2126724	2127925	would you say Halo 3 sold 3 giga copies?
2158465	2164207	Micro in this sense is not used as a prefix for an actual numerical factor such as centi, milli, kilo, nano, etc.
2164527	2168108	but more as a description of relative size in contrast with macro.
2168848	2172549	Refer to the established English terms of macroeconomics and microeconomics, if you will.
2173709	2175490	But no one says microtransactions anyway.
2175610	2175830	Why?
2176210	2183272	Because as the English language is to buzzwords, human being is to a horribly grotesque cross-species partial abortion, think Minotaur.
2183992	2184672	It never should have
2185797	2200292	should have been and should have been put out of its misery, which I'm quite sure the entirety of Orange Lounge Radio will be quite eager to do after reading this superfluous, verbose, and... Thank you, whoever emailed this in to make her read these words.
2200792	2202294	Hey, I have very good pronunciation.
2202334	2202654	Thank you.
2203315	2206138	A vexatiously nitpicky email comprised of run-on sentences.
2206498	2208040	I do have to agree with you there.
2208080	2209021	It is fairly run-on.
2209480	2213582	Although actually you are grammatically correct in your last sentence, I have to say.
2214782	2218184	I shall spare you any further opportunities to become tongue-tied and I wish you all the best.
2218524	2222866	I look forward to each episode as eagerly as a cocaine addict awaits for his next hit of snow.
2223626	2225647	Rubber buggy baby bumpers, DJ Dysentery.
2226287	2231089	And by the way, you... By the way... Okay, he obviously was putting that in just to fuck with you.
2231929	2233270	By the way, you misspelled cocaine.
2236124	2236725	DarkSakura.com
2259853	2260593	There already is one.
2261053	2261634	Is there really?
2261894	2263454	I'm pretty sure there already is one.
2264674	2267175	There's also... You can find a podcast.
2267515	2271216	No, there is a Grammar Nazi podcast because somebody sent it to me.
2272317	2273397	No, I'm not even kidding.
2273417	2274637	Where can I download it?
2274977	2276038	I can't remember who...
2277114	2292982	Who did it, but I listened to it about a year and a half ago where they would receive emails about different grammatical mistakes and then try to give you the proper way to say that and certain usages and when it's appropriate to use this spelling or that spelling.
2293422	2299685	And I also found one that was all about the differences between British English and American English.
2299805	2301106	Where can I got that podcast?
2303027	2303207	LOL
2304793	2305133	You know what?
2305173	2307395	You can do what everybody else does and search for it on iTunes.
2309176	2309737	I don't wanna.
2309957	2312198	I hate that my iPhone is making me use iTunes, though.
2313219	2314640	Can you continue, please?
2314820	2315060	What?
2315241	2315681	We's done.
2316221	2316922	Oh, no more emails?
2317202	2318023	We is done.
2318083	2318863	We is done.
2320024	2322046	We done good on those emails.
2322386	2325408	Alright, if you want emails, mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com.
2325448	2326989	Sorry to the people we didn't get to tonight.
2327990	2329091	There's just too damn many emails.
2329111	2329611	What can we say?
2330271	2330932	Back to the gaming news.
2331351	2355190	Anyways, with all these patches and stuff being applied to new games for the PlayStation 3 and games that you might already have on the PlayStation 3, to support the DualShock 3 has gotten a lot of people wondering, hey, maybe I can just import a Japanese DualShock controller into my non-Japanese country and get to play these games with RumbleTastic features sooner than everybody else.
2356771	2356931	Nope.
2357389	2361513	Because apparently importers like PlayAsia said they've already pre-sold their expected supply.
2362514	2365957	And Sony, of course, doesn't support importing stuff.
2367438	2372622	So you will not be able to probably buy any anytime soon.
2373103	2381310	Because actually importers are charging upwards to $80 per joystick for what you would probably normally get for $50.
2381991	2383512	And I'm sure that's going to go up.
2384437	2396575	of course you know new games you just had a patch for Resistance Fall Man that added Rumble I know Motorstorm has Rumble now there was a patch with Ratchet and Clank Future that has Rumble just fucking wait
2397677	2399978	Why would they have to patch in rumble features?
2400318	2404979	Because you know the original 6-axis controller had no rumble.
2405119	2409960	Because rumble would interfere with the tilt sensors somehow in this magical world.
2410520	2413421	Because you can't actually have tilt and rumble in the same controller.
2413501	2415261	Oh wait, no, Nintendo did that.
2415301	2415982	I'm sorry.
2418862	2419723	So, hey.
2420903	2421283	Just wait.
2421723	2421923	Really.
2422323	2425244	I mean, plain, you know,
2426033	2430517	Resistance, Fallen Man with Rumble is not going to make it like, oh my god, this is the best game ever now!
2431238	2433300	The only game I really want to play with Rumble is Rez.
2434741	2436723	And I would hand off the Rumbler to someone else.
2436803	2438504	Because, you know, Rez is on the PS3.
2438864	2439865	We've all read that article.
2444009	2447592	Well, we have a, I guess, late-breaking news thing.
2447612	2451776	I'm going to jump in here with something that's panning out live while the show is going on.
2452296	2452877	I need like a
2453573	2455275	A fanfare or something.
2456817	2457638	Or we need something.
2457678	2458118	I don't know.
2459500	2460120	What do we have?
2460140	2462042	How about a drum roll with a laptop?
2462082	2463724	I'm looking for a fanfare noise.
2463804	2464125	Hold on.
2464165	2464545	Let's see.
2466868	2467749	Here we go.
2467809	2468089	Here we go.
2468129	2468670	Yes.
2468730	2469110	We've got it.
2469711	2471233	Now some late breaking news.
2471253	2471593	Bye.
2479736	2486125	Actdeft is practically flooding our chat room with what is going on in the latest Game Facts Battle.
2486485	2489549	You know, every damn year they do a character battle, every year.
2489850	2492093	This is the sixth year of the character battle.
2492708	2498189	And what makes this year different is that instead of two characters doing battle, it's groups of four.
2498629	2500249	And then two emerge victorious.
2500609	2502730	Well, we are now down to the final four.
2503290	2506451	And typical winners, Link and Cloud, are in there.
2506491	2507391	They've both won before.
2507871	2510071	Solid Snake is also in the top four.
2510691	2519973	But this is the amazing thing is that this looks to be the very first year that a Final Fantasy character or a Link character will not win
2520899	2521099	L-Block
2542967	2543747	Did I miss something?
2544007	2544687	I mean, seriously?
2545008	2546428	Because Tetris is pwned.
2546528	2550129	Because somehow an L block just fucking beat all these other characters.
2550809	2551429	You know what, though?
2551949	2553570	Well deserved, honestly.
2553750	2560211	Well deserved, because Tetris is one of those games I think people forget, you know, that is the casual game.
2560291	2562872	That was the casual game that really opened up the game to a lot of people.
2562912	2565133	I'm just glad that news had nothing to do with Tingle, so that's... Yes.
2566293	2569914	I thought for a second there they were just going to be like, yeah, Tingle's going to win.
2569954	2570674	I'm like, fuck.
2571967	2574008	That's going to suck.
2574048	2575088	I can't wait for that.
2575108	2578829	This just in, Eye of Judgment sold its millionth copy.
2579249	2580810	Loki, get the tights.
2581790	2584011	There's some interesting things about Eye of Judgment too.
2584031	2589933	Do you know how many people have come into chat tonight and said, one down, 999,199 to go.
2590233	2592173	Our whole contest has become counterproductive.
2592453	2594734	We are driving sales of Eye of Judgment.
2596255	2597595	I heard they have issues.
2598570	2598950	How so?
2598970	2600911	Let me put it this way.
2601312	2604794	They have similar issues to Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.
2607175	2607696	Interesting.
2607936	2612138	Certain integral parts of... They're not even going to be able to make a million of them.
2612339	2613419	You goddamn cheater!
2616821	2618622	Loki fucking cheated in this contest.
2618662	2620664	He knew they didn't have the parts to make a million of them.
2620684	2622025	How about I cleanse the palette?
2622205	2622585	Asshole.
2623906	2625547	And didn't I say this was going to happen?
2626207	2627408	Didn't I tell you?
2627935	2629937	No, wait, I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't do my actual story.
2630057	2630898	Oh, I thought you did.
2631098	2631298	No.
2631599	2631919	Well, fine.
2631939	2633581	I have to do the Famitsu story real quick.
2634041	2635182	Well, fine, do it.
2636383	2638766	You're going off on your tangents, confusing me.
2638926	2639306	Sorry.
2639526	2640267	God damn it!
2641728	2642229	Chocolate!
2643931	2646293	Get the bitch some chocolate, Christ almighty.
2646313	2646393	Yeah!
2648476	2649136	But I'm not going to eat it.
2649256	2649537	Here you go.
2650157	2653078	And damn it, I accidentally closed the tab that had this story on it.
2653098	2653819	Now I can't even do it.
2654499	2658161	Famitsu ran a list of the top 100 games that readers dig.
2658461	2664784	And actually, this is kind of similar to the character battle because I believe all the top games were basically Final Fantasy games and Zelda games.
2665284	2666865	I'm trying to bring up the list right now.
2668001	2669162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2697697	2698878	were that.
2699799	2703543	Other notable games on the chart, we should point out Street Fighter 2 came in at number 20.
2704084	2706226	The Super Mario Brothers came in at 21.
2706966	2709169	Final Fantasy 6 was in 25.
2710430	2711131	The fuck?
2711151	2712052	6 is like one of the best ones.
2712072	2714975	But Final Fantasy 7 has more fandom-y stuff.
2715115	2715355	Oh well.
2716161	2717261	Japan, you screwed that up.
2718002	2719202	Chrono Trigger, number 28.
2719942	2721763	Kingdom Hearts 2, number 29.
2722183	2725144	The original Legend of Zelda, 46.
2725564	2726925	51, Pokemon Red and Green.
2727325	2733567	And if you want to know where L Block ended up on the Famitsu list, 96 was where Tetris Game Boy ended up.
2733687	2734487	Gradius was on there.
2734707	2735868	Gradius was 98.
2735988	2736808	Super Mario Bros.
2736828	2737108	3 was 99.
2737228	2738649	I want to know where R-Type is.
2740109	2742690	Well, you'll just have to pick up this week's Famitsu magazine.
2743416	2745719	I don't want to go to San Francisco to go buy it.
2745739	2746580	Okay, you can do your story now.
2746780	2747040	Okay.
2748642	2750684	Now again, didn't I say this was going to happen?
2750744	2754589	And don't get me wrong, I love the technology.
2754749	2757332	I have one myself built into my PS3.
2757993	2760536	I love Blu-ray, but I also loved Betamax.
2763143	2765744	and Betamax was far superior to VHS.
2765984	2769325	I would also like to point out DarkSakura has an impressive Laserdisc collection.
2769485	2773747	I do, because I used to go to anime conventions and they'd sell Laserdisc for five bucks a piece.
2773887	2776748	So basically, if DarkSakura likes your media format, you're fucked.
2777028	2778749	She probably has a collection of 8-tracks somewhere.
2779269	2780810	Laserdisc did last for a while.
2781770	2785532	It was the enthusiast format.
2785792	2788073	You could saw off someone's head with one of those things, too.
2788093	2790073	Yeah, they were pretty heavy.
2790094	2791194	Whatever happened to Videodisc?
2793137	2794238	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2823450	2823790	Enjoy.
2824171	2825491	That would fucking rock.
2826052	2830595	I hope PlayStation 4 has those large pizza-sized discs.
2831095	2831936	That would be rad.
2831976	2835859	I want my next system to be the size of three Atari 5200s.
2835899	2838000	The end.
2838080	2840602	And I want it to weigh as much as ten Xboxes.
2843244	2845665	I want to have to get a dolly to put this thing in my house.
2845685	2849668	You know the Xbox is larger than an Atari 5200, but not wider.
2849708	2850028	Tangent.
2850048	2850989	What were you going to say about Blu-ray?
2851454	2857817	Kmart's not selling them anymore, so anyone, whatever, you know, no one really shops at Kmart.
2862338	2863859	I didn't know Kmart was still around.
2865960	2869041	I love the personal opinion that gets interjected in this show.
2869101	2870242	Okay, I take that back.
2870362	2871302	Here's tonight's news.
2871942	2873143	Kmart pulled Blu-ray.
2873183	2874743	Whatever, no one shops at Kmart.
2875844	2876444	I take that back.
2876944	2878885	I did buy pillows at Kmart because they were on sale.
2880570	2883030	And I bought my sheets for my massage at Kmart.
2883210	2884751	But other than that, no one shops at Kmart.
2885271	2889852	Okay, I don't know if Kmart's exactly the demographic for Blu-ray.
2889992	2891172	That's exactly what I'm saying.
2891252	2893672	Who thinks, gee, I'm going to go get a Blu-ray player.
2893712	2897733	Where can I get a really good, top-of-the-line Blu-ray player that's, I'm going to go to Kmart.
2898553	2903034	Well, keep in mind, even though Kmart did declare bankruptcy, they did go back and buy Sears.
2904094	2904314	So.
2904954	2905174	Okay.
2906655	2908695	If I want an Icy, I'll go to Kmart.
2908715	2908795	Okay.
2910332	2912813	I go there to buy sheets for my massage table and that's about it.
2913013	2916714	Or if heaven forbid I want something from the Martha Stewart collection, I'll go to Kmart.
2917015	2918895	Or if I want to go laugh at the poor people.
2919696	2920176	Just kidding.
2921356	2921896	I'm among you.
2922116	2925838	And Ranma is yelling in chat, hey dammit, I shop at Kmart.
2926158	2928399	RavensDolphin says, shit, I shop at Kmart.
2929859	2936402	Much like I go back to the conversation we had in part A where I said, LARPing, something you don't really want to admit to.
2939952	2940453	You know what?
2940513	2941894	Here's the reason why I don't... Okay.
2942655	2946699	Here's the reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore, even though this isn't supposed to be Dude, they have little Caesars.
2946960	2947340	Okay.
2947360	2948661	That's why I shop at Kmart.
2949062	2955729	Actually, I do also sometimes buy my DVR discs for my camera.
2955929	2956129	Okay.
2956190	2956590	Here's the thing.
2957469	2961412	I used to, my fondest memories of going to Kmart going shopping were in the 80s.
2961592	2965375	Like we used to go, you know, it would be like the big department store trip day, we're going to go to Kmart.
2965655	2967997	Here's the problem, here's the reason why I don't shop at Kmart anymore.
2968277	2972180	Because the store hasn't fucking changed a thing since the 80s.
2972560	2973741	Besides what's on the shelves.
2974201	2975162	No, not even the clothes.
2975702	2976743	Except... Yes.
2977418	2979599	Except I did find a cute sweater there.
2979979	2983541	But it also was like one of those 80s revival styles.
2983921	2987083	I think I saw some underwear for sale that was actually from the 80s.
2987143	2987983	I bought socks.
2989584	2993946	You can buy socks at Kmart because socks, you know, are socks.
2994086	3002450	I think they actually still have those doors that you have to like step on the mat where it triggers the door before infrared technology or something like that.
3002935	3004916	Okay, can we move on before we get the hate mail from the Kmart?
3004936	3007758	Okay, they're not carrying Blu-ray players anymore, so whatever.
3008058	3010679	Yeah, the hate mail from that one Kmart person, okay.
3011520	3011820	Okay.
3012520	3018023	Anyways, here's some exciting news, and I'm going to say this is very specific exciting news.
3018043	3019184	It has nothing to do with Kmart.
3019364	3020265	It has nothing to do with Kmart.
3020885	3023787	LucasArts and BioWare are teaming up for something.
3025327	3026048	Something.
3027259	3028180	Yes, that's right.
3028240	3032222	They're working on an undisclosed interactive entertainment product.
3032282	3034123	But it's LucasArts and BioWare, so what else do you really need?
3034143	3034823	It's going to be awesome.
3034843	3036784	It's going to be like Knights of the Old Republic or something like that.
3037525	3039966	It's Knights of the Old Indiana Jones Republic, that's right.
3041047	3043248	I feel the need to say something nice about Kmart now.
3045649	3049991	They do carry the diet cranberry serumist.
3050612	3053313	I will pre-order the LucasArts BioWare game at Kmart.
3053373	3053713	No, I won't.
3054074	3056475	But I will tell you one thing that Kmart's good for.
3057785	3059686	They don't care about street dates.
3060527	3065731	Because that's where I got Serenity, like two weeks before it came out.
3065811	3070694	And I got it as an early Christmas gift for Extover, and he was all excited because he had Serenity on DVD before any of his friends.
3071695	3072656	Oh, I'm sorry, LucasArts?
3073516	3074497	They're making something.
3074557	3074817	Okay.
3075398	3075578	Hooray!
3078112	3079854	Rumors, rumors, rumors.
3079934	3083598	And this rumor has something to do with Oblivion.
3083638	3085400	That's right, the Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
3085740	3087422	The game that just won't stay out in the news.
3087502	3090085	I mean, this game has been making headlines since it came out.
3090966	3099155	And now, it should be noted that the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, that's ZeniMax Media, has registered the domain name
3099773	3109282	Elder Scrolls Online.com Could this mean that Elder Scrolls Oblivion could make its way online?
3109722	3110403	Be an MMO?
3110443	3113605	Hell, somebody already hacked the game to do this on the PC version.
3113946	3116548	Could this be a further way to milk the Oblivion franchise?
3116608	3117008	Who knows?
3117169	3119270	It could give World of Warcraft a run for their money.
3119330	3120932	Puppy, how many hours have you spent on Oblivion?
3122320	3123180	A lot.
3123360	3124040	A lot, right?
3124060	3126141	A lot in a two-week span of time.
3126201	3127461	So what would you think of this?
3127801	3131122	If there was an Oblivion online, would you play it, or is this jumping the shark?
3131922	3132282	I don't know.
3133562	3138663	With as much characterization and customization areas, I don't know.
3139703	3141484	They would have to do a lot to expand the world.
3142624	3149465	Because running around in the world in Oblivion, it's like running, running, running, running, tree, rock,
3150244	3151185	Oh look, a rabbit.
3151445	3152385	Run, run, run, run, run.
3152465	3153946	Oh look, hey look, a dungeon.
3154346	3156447	We're going to be punching horses online.
3157147	3157868	In the face.
3158308	3160069	A sheep tossing contest would be fun.
3160689	3161189	Good times.
3161569	3162870	Yeah, but you know what it doesn't have?
3163510	3165211	You can't kick bugs in the face.
3166272	3168332	You can kick sheep in the face, probably.
3168373	3170313	You can't kick bees in the face.
3176576	3178017	Sorry, I'm looking at chat right now.
3179369	3182011	I gotta go back to the Kmart thing because this shit's funny.
3182792	3188035	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Kmart still sells Rakas Dukakis shirts.
3193740	3194340	Hilarity.
3196041	3199204	Rob with 2B says, I go to Kmart to trip over stuff in the aisles.
3203667	3204908	Blue light special.
3205488	3206369	Okay, anyway, sorry.
3207299	3211663	Okay, so Elder Scrolls may be online, at least if recent domain names are to be believed.
3212003	3213545	Skypline is opening soon.
3213925	3217408	You can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3217489	3219350	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3219691	3222153	We have a couple more stories before we get there.
3222493	3222894	Right, Jamie?
3223794	3225976	Yes, if someone would stop hogging the mic, puppy.

3240460	3240680	What?
3240801	3250889	Game art Okay, so Namco Bandai I agree with Misty Why would you want to kick a bee in the face anyway?
3251769	3264780	Just because it's the act of kicking a bee in the face Oh, well, shit I'm so sorry Just because it's the novelty How dare I
3266451	3266691	What?
3266972	3270775	I don't know, Loki, you're just like, you look impatient over there like, I want this show to finish.
3271136	3274339	No, he's watching that video again.
3274899	3276241	I'm not watching that video again.
3277282	3277902	Okay.
3278182	3278983	Namco Bandai.
3279003	3279784	Yes, Namco Bandai.
3280545	3282627	Have announced a Wii exclusive.
3284068	3285029	Soul Calibur Legends.
3286370	3287572	Which is very, very happy.
3287712	3289734	We will have everybody, so far.
3290541	3291564	and hopefully new people.
3291885	3294814	Wait, I think we're getting some late breaking news, Rob.
3295195	3295496	Oh, yes.
3295556	3295917	Oh, sorry.
3296097	3297221	Late breaking news.
3297401	3297742	I'm sorry.
3297762	3297903	Here's...
3306404	3310025	We go to our correspondent, Loki, live in the OLR studio with Late Breaking News.
3310086	3317848	Yes, apparently the reaction to Soul Calibur Legends going gold is, Who gives a fuck?
3317908	3319209	It's going to be crappy anyways.
3319409	3326392	Hey, did anyone remember, what was that stupid game with, it's like a spin-off of Tekken.
3326812	3330253	God, I've blocked it from my brain.
3330273	3332034	Oh, the one that had Nina, it starred Nina, didn't it?
3332952	3333892	Quick, Jamie, Tekken Trivia.
3333912	3334593	Death by Degrees.
3334633	3334913	Thank you.
3334973	3335773	Death by Degrees.
3335833	3336593	Yeah, yeah.
3336833	3338314	That's this game all over again.
3343495	3344636	Ivy, Death by Degrees.
3346016	3346976	But will she have the whip?
3347036	3347757	That's all we need to know.
3347877	3351718	I actually kind of wanted Death by Degrees just because of me being a big Tekken nerd.
3352618	3356599	I even have the dumb Tekken game that was on Wonderswan.
3357760	3358500	That's pretty sad.
3358620	3359560	It was like Tekken Card.
3359580	3360941	That's like buying Tekken on your cell phone.
3360961	3362181	All right.
3366628	3368849	Quick, another story, then the Skype line.
3369789	3371990	Anyways, um, yes.
3372591	3377573	So this totally, I don't know, perpetuates all the stereotypes of...
3378288	3379308	Halo 3 Players
3402199	3406000	was told by his mother to turn off his Xbox 360 as it was getting late.
3406380	3424043	After he refused, his mother took his AirCard, which is apparently an adapter you can use for your cell phone to get Wi-Fi, from the 360, preventing him from playing online and prompting a fit of rage that would see the child frantically search through the house before punching his mom in the face.
3425504	3431805	The kid then retreated to his room, but soon had to deal with the local sheriff deputies, who his mom
3432264	3433405	Thank you for watching!
3461704	3462524	Kids these days.
3463344	3464545	Kids do the darndest things.
3467085	3472047	But now I can just imagine people on Halo yelling, Oh, you stupid mother puncher!
3473367	3474887	Well, dude, this is stupid anyways.
3474927	3477588	I mean, your fucking kid is, like, playing Halo.
3477648	3478848	It's a maturity game.
3479388	3482949	Oh my god, it must be the violence of the game that caused him to punch his mom in the face.
3483049	3489191	What I really want to know is, um, what have they been doing to their child up to that point?
3490489	3491870	They would have a violent reaction.
3492151	3495093	Or maybe their child already had psychological problems.
3495373	3495753	You know.
3496674	3498015	Took them to Kmart.
3501998	3504780	Here's our new OLR in-joke.
3505101	3506222	We have Kmart.
3506402	3508043	Hey, Timmy, it's Disneyland.
3508203	3509284	This is Kmart.
3509784	3511045	No, it's Disneyland.
3511305	3512206	Kmart.
3512586	3514288	No, Disneyland.
3514928	3515309	Go play.
3515449	3516950	But it seems to me...
3517853	3518974	I was freaking some fucking noobs!
3518994	3519194	You know...
3540663	3546385	Dan's little cousin's kid comes over and plays games at our house sometimes.
3546465	3548145	And has he ever punched you in the face?
3548845	3549065	No.
3550626	3552406	He's always been well-behaved.
3552506	3554687	That's because his parents teach him right.
3555687	3564149	I think it's a fault with the parents, but I do think it's good that she did have him actually stand accountable for what he did.
3565626	3567467	ShadowCharlie asks, how old was this kid?
3568167	3571248	The age and name were withheld.
3571848	3573609	I heard he was just 15 or something like that.
3575329	3577650	Well, I heard you suck.
3580011	3581531	Oh, your mom.
3581551	3584272	Yeah, some Florida kid.
3587413	3589854	Indian River County website.
3590034	3593475	They have a website for Indian River County for Florida.
3594229	3595890	Where to stay, where to dine, what to do.
3596270	3599032	Discover our lifestyle choices, including dying.
3599552	3603774	With pictures of old people on a golf course and on a beach and in a dining room.
3604114	3604474	Dying.
3605815	3606015	Sorry.
3606375	3607416	Lordy, lordy, lordy.
3607476	3611238	All right, let's open up the Skype line.
3611258	3616100	If you want to give us a call, the phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3616541	3619602	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3620523	3622644	And you can comment on any of tonight's stories.
3623303	3624444	or you can make a Kmart joke.
3624484	3625725	I don't really care tonight.
3626485	3629307	After tonight's show, I'm like crying from laughing so hard.
3629648	3630508	It's not that funny.
3630848	3634791	I know I'm going to be listening to this show like in the car later, so I'm going to go, this show really wasn't that funny.
3634831	3635812	Why were you laughing so much?
3636292	3637313	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3637333	3637693	Who's this?
3638694	3641015	It's the Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.
3641316	3643737	Hi, Midnight Special, Raven's Dolphin.
3643938	3645098	Did you just get back from Kmart?
3646039	3648321	Yes, I just got back from Kmart, and guess what?
3648361	3649421	There is no Blueway players!
3649982	3651723	Alright, what's on your mind, Raven's Dolphin?
3652526	3654448	Mario Galaxy, that's what's on my mind.
3654748	3663338	I know, but let's not go there.
3664339	3670346	I know Jamie said that she's getting a retail copy at her store, so I actually got the chance to play it at a GameStop.
3671287	3672428	And what did you think, young man?
3673442	3674543	I think the game looked great.
3674763	3675864	I love the controls.
3675944	3678006	I think the game just looked great.
3678166	3684692	I mean, well, the game was on an HDTV, so it left a lot to be desired, which was a little sad.
3685032	3686974	A little sad about that, but the controls were great.
3687054	3688215	Everything was great about it.
3689096	3692518	Is this a game that kids across the country are going to be craving come this Christmas season?
3693259	3693539	Craving?
3693559	3694760	They're going to be dying for it.
3695501	3698103	Are you going to be shooting each other like they were PS3s?
3699284	3699685	I don't know.
3699965	3700085	Hmm.
3702011	3705014	Well, I mean, you know, if you want to get the game, just never mind.
3705234	3707516	I was going to make a joke, but I'm beating that joke on the ground.
3709358	3714102	Super Mario Galaxy is so awesome, you'll punch your mother in the face just to play some more.
3717425	3718846	Yeah, is the game that great?
3718886	3720547	Is it worth punching your mom in the face over?
3721248	3722449	I think so, but...
3725749	3728832	Let's go ahead and call his mom so that we know to hide.
3728852	3730334	You don't know what your child is saying.
3730794	3734117	Alright, what else did you call it to tell us about Ravenstaff?
3734177	3736840	And you just wanted to say that Mario Galaxy is cool?
3737793	3740876	Mario Galaxy and Phoenix, sorry, Charles and Turbobout is very good.
3741136	3742077	Music's phenomenal.
3742277	3742778	Oh my god.
3742858	3747002	Okay, you know Shane, who used to guest on this show a lot before he moved back to Kansas.
3747442	3751466	Like, okay, we have a Ventrilo server for World of Warcraft slash Final Fantasy XI, basically.
3751486	3752627	Be careful on those.
3752928	3758393	Yeah, well, yeah, I've heard... No, I want Ventrilo Harassment Guy to sign on to our Ventrilo.
3758493	3761096	I'm like, roll out the fucking red carpet for him.
3761116	3762457	I think that guy's fucking hilarious.
3762898	3766320	But anyway, I would be so honored if he came on.
3766340	3767920	I'd be like, yay, it's Ventrilo the Harassment Guy.
3768220	3773703	Anyway, the thing about Shane, though, is that he has been signing on to Ventrilo this week.
3774223	3775464	And we're like, Shane, where are you?
3775504	3777865	You're not in WoW, and you're not playing Final Fantasy XI either.
3777885	3779205	He's like, oh, I'm playing Phoenix Wright.
3781806	3783547	And we're like, why are you signed on to Vent?
3783587	3785128	He's like, I don't know.
3785148	3785988	I'm playing Phoenix Wright.
3786008	3786929	I just thought I'd say hello.
3787669	3788529	He's like, okay, I've got to go.
3788549	3789069	I've got a case.
3789490	3790230	You know what I need to do?
3790902	3793183	I need to play Guild Wars and Ragnarok at the same time
3811474	3814876	I've been doing this experimental podcast called the Cartoon Cast.
3815237	3818559	We've been talking about Count Ducula and showing old cartoons like that.
3819219	3820980	I would love to see a Count Ducula game.
3821360	3824002	Who wouldn't?
3824182	3826404	I would not like to see a Count Ducula game.
3827324	3827644	Why?
3827724	3830186	Because the show's been off the air for years.
3831664	3833886	Okay, so Dragon Ball Z has been off the air for years.
3833926	3835007	Why are we still getting games?
3835207	3836608	Because Atari, that's all they got.
3836668	3837169	Well, you know what?
3837209	3840952	They probably still show episodes of it on the Kmart TVs, okay?
3841072	3845235	No, I've seen episodes of Count Dracula on TV a while back.
3846777	3847037	Oh, wow.
3847057	3848578	But that's what the internet's for, right?
3849259	3849679	Exactly.
3849739	3850180	That important.
3850200	3850820	We've got YouTube.
3851501	3851821	All right.
3852201	3852862	YouTube's amazing.
3852882	3853983	Is that it then, Raven's Dolphin?
3854643	3855344	That is it.
3855404	3856545	Thank you for taking my call.
3856605	3857766	You are most welcome, sir.
3857846	3858407	Have a great week.
3859908	3860108	All right.
3860523	3861584	Wow, he hung up on himself.
3862244	3863125	I didn't even click the button.
3863625	3869810	If you want to give us a call or use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3870230	3871171	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3871191	3871531	Who's this?
3872732	3874913	Oh, it's truly Legend of Zaku.
3875073	3876254	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
3876294	3876955	What's on your mind?
3877935	3878636	Um, nothing.
3878696	3883720	Don't mind me for the fact that this girl just dumped me a short while ago.
3884360	3885441	I'm sorry to hear that.
3885621	3885941	I am.
3886842	3889504	But yeah, I guess, you know... Whiskey makes it all better.
3890782	3891102	Jamie.
3891242	3901009	Manhunt 2, you know, that whole, that whole controversy, that whole clusterfuck that, that Rockstar Manson Okay, seriously, Zaku, wait, I gotta stop you right here.
3901510	3901790	Okay?
3902710	3905973	After breaking up with your girlfriend, I would not recommend playing Manhunt 2.
3906073	3908034	That's gonna give you totally bad ideas.
3908454	3910936	I'm not gonna, I'm not, I'm a sidler, right?
3910996	3913718	I've talked to him since I was like, what, 11?
3914139	3920283	So, yeah, I guess, I don't know, I don't get, I don't get why, you know, why companies like Rockstar just, you know, they try to
3921246	3936476	and try to half-ass their way by just covering up stuff, you know, covering up, you know, bits that were thrown back when the ESRB told them to, and all of a sudden, you know, hackers find a way to make us gamers look bad, to make the industry look bad.
3939287	3946832	Honestly, when they said, oh, we're going to mask this stuff, that was just an open invite to the hackers to say, find out how we mask this and unmask it.
3947192	3954317	I mean, I know I can understand that the rating board actually knew about the content.
3955616	3975667	that was blurred out, but wouldn't it make more sense not to give ammunition to the critics, to anyone who's out to get people like Rockstar for the fact that they get called out on stuff that was supposedly rejected before but is still in the game, just not seen.
3975687	3984672	Kind of like the whole hot coffee thing, where it still shouldn't have been on the disc in the first place.
3985270	3999354	and they should have learned not hiding, not obscuring it from the ratings board, not doing that, but just not having the common sense to not keep it out of the disc in the first place.
3999374	4006016	So be it if you have to recreate the build, but that shit happens in our job.
4006596	4010517	You know what just occurred to me because we were talking about Oblivion a little bit ago?
4012197	4013658	You know, this is very strange.
4013778	4014618	It just occurred to me
4015416	4024643	Did they not make Bethesda go back and re-rate Oblivion because somebody found a way to hack the game so that the girl's top could come off and you could have boobies?
4024663	4028626	But you also have to understand... Isn't this the same fucking thing?
4029127	4040796	You also have to understand that, you know, we don't know whether or not that company, you know, submitted that, you know, all the assets for the characters within, you know,
4042094	4043497	for the ratings board.
4043757	4044418	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4044438	4044779	But hold on.
4044839	4046502	I just had an epiphany with this whole thing.
4047043	4047644	I mean, totally.
4047684	4048165	Wait a minute.
4049628	4051011	I just owned ESRB.
4051051	4051772	No, no, no.
4051792	4052153	You didn't.
4052473	4053115	And here's why.
4053215	4053816	It's because...
4054384	4056405	That was on the PC that they did the mod.
4056445	4064230	Mods on PCs are fairly available, whereas a PSP version, the hack it, means you have to have an illegitimate copy of the game.
4064350	4066551	But still, it's on principle.
4067092	4068913	What a fucking great line we are walking.
4068933	4072595	It shouldn't have been on the disc or on the actual... It's fucking boobies too.
4073437	4076379	I think they should have just taken the AO rating.
4076519	4081342	Honestly, I think the problem is that the AO rating is the kiss of death.
4081442	4082503	It's the same problem with X-Men.
4082523	4088226	No, because the problem is the AO rating means your game does not get published for the PlayStation 2, the Wii, or the PSP.
4088246	4089187	And that's the problem.
4089387	4090488	That's the problem.
4090508	4092089	You only get limited to one platform.
4093670	4102055	The other thing you have to understand is that legislators right now, they want to push bills that will add more quote-unquote truth in the ratings.
4103237	4110200	Basically trying to find a way to call people out for mods, even if it wasn't the responsibility of the designer itself.
4110260	4112200	Just for the fact that it shouldn't give people...
4122068	4129032	should give hackers or any folks like that the tools to create that much controversy to give that much ammo.
4129112	4134956	I'm going to agree with Fursby in our chat room on that who says it's just fucking pixels.
4135516	4135996	And I agree.
4136016	4142340	It's pixels, but then it's something that the human brain can translate as boobs.
4142520	4151526	Well, let's also realize that the legislators making these decisions and trying to get all this stuff done, they're like generations behind us.
4152199	4154821	Yeah, they're only out to score political points.
4155201	4158264	You know, the bill's fate be damned.
4158364	4158724	That's it.
4158804	4160526	All they care about is keeping their seat.
4160866	4165169	Yeah, once they die off and go away, we'll get some smarter people in there and things will be better.
4165410	4168913	But then we're going to run into the same complaints.
4169213	4171915	Zaku, I've got to let you go because we're going on five minutes of this call.
4171935	4172956	We've got to get some more calls.
4173056	4174277	But thank you for your perspective.
4175037	4175878	We appreciate it as always.
4176399	4177499	And sorry to hear about the girl.
4178600	4180162	There's plenty of fish in the sea, Zaku.
4181062	4181563	You'll find one.
4181683	4181903	All right.
4182922	4188047	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4188107	4189108	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4189128	4189509	Who's this?
4190389	4191671	Hey, this is Rob with 2Bs.
4191871	4193192	Wow, Rob with 2Bs.
4193232	4194093	How you doing, sir?
4194774	4195595	Yeah, I'm doing fine.
4195655	4198678	I just decided to call in because it was too long to write in chat.
4198898	4206245	I was going to say, I think we hear from you a lot on email and totally appreciate it, but I think this might be the first time I can recall you calling into the show.
4207106	4207226	It's
4207862	4208222	VG Expo
4232375	4232735	Interesting.
4232775	4234697	Sorry, I just said the forbidden phrase on the show.
4234737	4235197	My bad.
4235237	4237099	Especially since the man is near rabid.
4237479	4239540	Anyway, what did you want to say about America's VG Expo?
4239560	4240141	Did you go, Rob?
4240941	4242362	Yeah, I went on Saturday.
4242883	4246225	It really is only worth a day trip if you live in the area.
4247566	4253170	It was in Philadelphia Convention Center, which is downtown, about 10 minutes from the airport.
4253430	4255972	And I hate to admit it, but it was a better location.
4257633	4259555	They had the Rock Band Tour event.
4261069	4264110	They had the Dell Intel Hi-Def Tour.
4265631	4266451	Gosh, I'm trying to remember.
4266491	4268532	They had a few contests on Guitar Hero.
4269072	4272094	All right, that's all I can remember.
4273894	4275055	It sounds like there was a lot to see.
4275075	4276215	It sounds like it was E for All.
4277436	4283178	No, I didn't go to E for All, but you get done with things fast there.
4284299	4290281	Plus, they didn't have much on the forums or anything.
4291369	4307102	Basically, on the day I was there, they had the journalist forum, they had the Mortal Kombat movie, they had their Jack Thompson panel, and they had something I skipped, the Postal 2 preview.
4309424	4310145	Sounds skippable.
4311646	4315969	I want to make it short, so anybody who didn't go can understand what went on.
4317260	4321483	The Game Journalists interviews is always a good one and nobody goes to it.
4321783	4325846	And it's... Gosh, I can't remember the names of the people.
4326006	4327387	What kind of game journalists were they?
4327427	4329808	Were they independent folks like us that do podcasting?
4329848	4333871	Or were we talking like folks from GameSpot, 1UP type people?
4334611	4334832	Yes.
4335372	4337934	We had one from 1UP, one from GameStop.
4338554	4339595	Not GameStop, EGM.
4339655	4340095	I'm sorry.
4340255	4341556	The original editor of EGM.
4342577	4343397	When it was spelled out.
4343877	4344017	And...
4346943	4350824	They had the director of marketing for Ziff Davis.
4353565	4354546	He was really informative.
4355266	4369391	To make a long story short, the best thing he said was, if you want to be a game journalist, and he said this because it's in their own company, you should blog on 1UP and make reviews less than 90 words.
4370311	4370511	That's
4372498	4372738	Wait.
4372978	4374219	That's the best way to get noticed.
4374499	4378761	If you want to be a game journalist, you should get reviews that are less than 90 words?
4379621	4379841	Yes.
4381302	4381502	Yaris.
4381522	4382102	That's really short.
4382462	4382862	Sucks.
4385043	4390706	It takes at least 10 more words to get your mom on Mother of the Year nomination.
4392767	4396628	Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really sucks.
4397849	4398449	Okay, here we go.
4398489	4398789	Here we go.
4398949	4399250	I got it.
4399770	4399930	Yaris.
4399950	4400150	Yaris.
4400979	4402600	At least it's not E.T.
4402780	4403181	on the Atari 2600.
4403221	4406023	Yeah, we can't actually bury it.
4406383	4407344	Okay, here we go, here we go.
4407664	4411067	Yaris sucks, would rather have gone to Kmart.
4412828	4419013	Yeah, um... The sound you hear is a dead horse being beaten over and over again in the studio.
4420734	4424497	Okay, well, the Mortal Kombat movie is very good.
4424617	4429521	It could make you motion sick, because they have a really long quake sequence in there, and it's, um...
4430248	4435409	A lot of video game graphics running in the background while the interviews are going on.
4435849	4441471	It's actually, in my opinion, it's too much video game graphics, but they do some really funny transitions.
4442071	4444051	So it's worth a listen.
4444911	4446312	It leaves the gray area gray.
4449493	4459095	And then Jack Thompson and the guy he was sparring against was Lorne Lanning, who helped to co-create Oddworld Inhabitants.
4460982	4471727	and they were sparring off and Jack was funny and he was civil and, you know, I really hate, you know, I don't have any dirt on him.
4471987	4472868	He was very smart.
4473268	4474969	Well, he knew he was in enemy territory.
4475329	4476109	I mean, you know.
4476550	4481912	Yeah, he probably went back onto the game politics, put comment forums a couple hours later and started slandering people.
4481932	4483313	They all smelled like ass.
4484353	4488335	I know, his comments on game politics are really like personality too.
4488355	4488996	Yeah.
4489196	4489476	So,
4491551	4493352	Well, Rob, we... Oh, yeah, go ahead.
4494172	4502716	Oh, Lorne pretty much lost the interview because he got emotional and he started attacking Jackie Poo's character, which was really a mistake.
4502936	4503176	Oops.
4503476	4505898	And, you know, it doesn't matter who won.
4505938	4507118	It doesn't change my opinion.
4508119	4508659	I agree.
4508899	4509720	It's just one debate.
4509960	4511580	He may have won the battle, but he hasn't won the war.
4512601	4515542	And you should have seen they made us go through the security check.
4515823	4516643	Yeah.
4518052	4518613	Good times.
4518913	4526360	Well, Rob, we've got to let you go, but we really appreciate the call talking about the VG Expo, which we all forgot happened, so I'm glad somebody was there to remind us, alrighty?
4527080	4529683	Well, I only live like 90 minutes from it, so... Nice.
4530163	4532886	Well, glad to hear you had a good time, and hope to hear from you in the future.
4532926	4533566	Don't be a stranger.
4534227	4534868	Alright, see ya.
4534928	4535368	Take care, buddy.
4537330	4543936	I feel bad because I'm making our callers wrap it up, but, you know, I know there's still a bunch of people that want to call in, so we'll take maybe two more calls?
4545272	4550413	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4550913	4551733	If you want to give us a call.
4555874	4558054	I will open it up for some... Oh, never mind, we're getting a call.
4558995	4560155	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4560175	4560515	Who's this?
4564455	4565836	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4565856	4566236	Who's this?
4568856	4569696	We cannot hear you.
4569956	4572097	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
4572617	4572997	Quien es?
4575188	4576028	Did you say Guinness?
4576048	4576909	Did you plug in my mic?
4577429	4577589	What?
4578329	4579930	The crap is happening.
4579970	4580290	Hi.
4580370	4580670	Hi.
4580690	4580730	Hi.
4581290	4582611	Were you not expecting to get through?
4583991	4585772	No, I didn't plug my mic in.
4586032	4587352	Oh, well, good job, DMN.
4587392	4589353	Yay!
4589453	4590233	Well, hi, DMN.
4590253	4591894	What's on your mind now that we can actually hear you?
4593194	4602238	I'm actually calling in response to one of the long emails Dark Sakura had about Nintendo and ignorance and the Nintendo 64.
4603601	4605182	Goodie, goodie, what do you have to say?
4605882	4610484	Do any of you have any idea as to why Nintendo is still around?
4611724	4612445	Uh, Mario.
4613185	4613465	No.
4613765	4614586	Handheld.
4615006	4620848	No, um, because of their, uh, involvement still in the, um, Hanafuda card business.
4621668	4623089	That's exactly it, Jamie.
4623189	4623429	No.
4623489	4624150	Pokemon.
4624170	4624610	Pokemon.
4625050	4625230	Yeah.
4626925	4632210	That game has sold well over 14 to 15 million copies, and that's just the originals alone.
4633411	4635693	That's the reason why Nintendo's still in business.
4635794	4638957	Had that game not have sold well in America, Nintendo would be kaput.
4641571	4644013	So the Nintendo 64 tanked.
4645094	4646455	Let's all admit that it tanked.
4646515	4647675	It wasn't that great a system.
4648476	4652599	Nintendo lost a lot of money on it, and they didn't do that great on the GameCube either.
4653139	4656542	They're just now rebounding back with the DS and the Wii.
4657543	4664127	So saying that the Nintendo 64 kept it in their form, no.
4664487	4666349	Did it have games I personally enjoyed?
4666449	4666709	Yes.
4667410	4669411	But I don't think it was that successful of a system.
4670256	4673798	Rob with two B's, our last caller, is back in chat and says, Nintendo sells at profit.
4673838	4674819	That's why they're still around.
4675640	4676020	That too.
4676060	4679002	I mean, the GameCube from its inception sold profit.
4679162	4682224	The Wii, since its inception, has sold at profit.
4682304	4686507	The DS, even with both models, has sold at profit.
4688528	4691950	So Nintendo knows what they're doing with hardware.
4692371	4693451	That's why they're still in it.
4693651	4696013	And like I said earlier, Pokemon Snap is the shit.
4696213	4698735	So, you know, Pokemon for the win.
4698775	4698955	Okay.
4700285	4702547	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, DMN?
4706531	4707011	Oh, man.
4707331	4712116	Oh, Guitar Hero 3 massively multiplayer-a-thon that I talked about on my show.
4712496	4713797	I want to pitch that really quick.
4713957	4714478	What's this?
4714618	4723526	If you are an OLR fanboy, listener, on-air talent, get together on Xbox Live or on a Nintendo Wi-Fi connection this Saturday.
4723986	4725207	I believe it's November the 9th.
4727103	4734505	and get together, play with some fellow OLR listeners and have some fun because Guitar Hero 3 is a very fun game especially on multiplayer this time around.
4734626	4737646	Or you could join our band on the website.
4737666	4738427	That too, I did.
4738567	4740027	I joined it like just now.
4740227	4741608	Oh, I see your request.
4741648	4743828	I'm going to go in and approve it right now.
4745669	4747149	I'm working on that right now as we talk.
4747850	4749410	He's clicking on the red X. I am.
4750110	4752371	Okay, and now I'm going to click on the button that hangs up on you, okay?
4753511	4754271	Okay.
4754391	4755012	Bye, friend.
4755812	4756092	All right.
4756513	4757033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4775289	4782954	They're saying that since the project started, they've been using 670,000 PlayStation 3s.
4787217	4796143	According to this, it says the FAH is now the most powerful distributed computing network ever at over a petaflop.
4798188	4801709	That sounds like something that would be on Dateline NBC, a petaflop.
4801729	4806731	It's over 250 teraflops, which is a trillion calculations per second.
4808131	4812312	So they have been using the PS3 as a computer.
4812552	4825236	And the whole point of the folding project is basically to look how proteins fold because they have evidence to show that proteins that don't fold properly are related to Alzheimer's and other diseases.
4826236	4826356	Okay.
4827736	4830157	The amazing things being accomplished with the PlayStation 3.
4830517	4830997	What can we say?
4832058	4834799	And Rob with 2Bs asks in chat, what's a microflop then?
4836019	4839081	That would be this episode.
4840661	4841041	Good point.
4841342	4842822	We're getting another call on the Skype line.
4842862	4843742	Let's go take it.
4843863	4845643	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4845683	4846103	Who's this?
4846784	4848264	Hello, it's Rice Princess.
4848504	4849665	Hi, Rice Princess.
4849785	4851946	You're supposed to be here in studio tonight.
4852446	4853406	I totally was.
4853506	4854047	I'm sorry.
4854447	4855027	What gives?
4856384	4858105	Um, I have a flat tire.
4858665	4859045	Fired.
4859845	4860185	I know.
4860205	4860886	I'm sorry.
4860946	4861386	Too cute.
4862026	4863086	Alright, well, what's on your mind?
4863126	4865907	And put the mic a little closer to your mouth because you're barely coming in.
4866628	4867448	This better?
4867508	4868168	Oh my gosh.
4868288	4869028	Is it louder?
4869128	4870209	Jesus Christ, yes.
4870869	4871109	Alright.
4872089	4872430	Much better.
4872850	4873230	What's on your mind?
4873250	4874190	What do you want to comment on tonight?
4875310	4875791	Oh, I don't know.
4875831	4876691	You told me to call in.
4877451	4879592	I told you to call in because you weren't here in person.
4879972	4881673	I just wanted to debrate you over the phone.
4882313	4882773	Oh, okay.
4882993	4883493	Shame on you.
4883853	4885154	Well, what have you been playing lately?
4885234	4885534	Anything?
4886889	4890331	I haven't been doing much game playing for the past couple weeks.
4892572	4894113	You haven't been playing a lot of WoW or anything?
4895234	4896134	Not really.
4896675	4896795	Oh.
4897435	4901157	Well, gee, a video game podcast sure does you a lot of good this week, doesn't it?
4901578	4902518	Doesn't it, though?
4902558	4907241	My gosh, I've been playing so little, like, it's kind of pointless for me to be calling in.
4907481	4908742	All right, well, then I'll hang up on you.
4909622	4909822	What?
4910082	4910903	I'll hang up on you, then.
4911403	4913184	Hey, jerk, you told me to call in.
4913584	4916046	Well, because I thought you'd want to say hi, because you weren't here in person.
4916642	4917623	Oh, well, hi.
4917783	4918303	All right, bye.
4918924	4921046	All right, 1-877.
4922307	4924528	I'm going to get spanked for that one later.
4924548	4927851	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4927891	4929112	Loki, got anything for us real quick?
4929132	4930052	We'll take one more call.
4932234	4936778	Circuit City is offering a pretty cool deal for people that purchase Call of Duty 4.
4937098	4938939	You get Call of Duty 3 for free.
4940881	4943723	And that's for... Because you probably already own it.
4944727	4945067	Hey, it's free.
4945087	4946448	Because you wouldn't want to play it.
4947328	4947928	It's free.
4948408	4951129	And also been leaked to the internet from what I've seen.
4953190	4958712	Sensible Soccer, or Sensible World of Soccer, is going to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade this month.
4959272	4962273	Following, also coming out on the PSC.
4962673	4964594	So, that's neat.
4965594	4965754	Maybe.
4965814	4967075	Except the game is how old?
4967515	4968595	We're getting another call on Skype.
4968615	4971236	Let's go take that and then we'll get to any more last minute stories.
4971256	4972196	This will be our last call tonight.
4972236	4973217	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4973237	4973557	Who's this?
4975457	4977759	Shadow Next Gen Shadow Next Gen
5005270	5014396	Contra 4, Call of Duty 4, Simpsons, there was Guitar Hero 3, Rock Band, there was quite a lot of games there to play.
5014656	5021261	The biggest complaint I heard about E4ALL was very similar to what Rob had just said about Video Game Expo, and that is, you could have done it all in a day.
5021861	5022281	Is that true?
5024443	5028245	You probably could have, but I mean, I was there for the whole time.
5028285	5031667	There was also the Video Game Live concert that I went to that was a lot of fun as well.
5031687	5033348	Nice, sounds like fun.
5033368	5034129	That was right across the street.
5034696	5035997	Right across the street from E4L.
5036417	5038658	Did you wait in line for Super Smash Bros.?
5040939	5043621	I didn't have to because I got in early.
5044161	5044481	Oh, nice.
5044501	5046122	So I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.
5046502	5046742	Nice.
5046782	5047243	How was it?
5048603	5049384	Super Smash Bros.
5049424	5050104	was a lot of fun.
5050324	5054927	I was... I believe I played as Link and they had a level from Twilight Princess in there.
5055987	5060730	They had the bridge level where you're jousting with that big enemy on the Warthog.
5061210	5061390	Mm-hmm.
5062806	5063506	It was a lot of fun.
5063806	5067347	Do you think this game has the potential to be OMG best game ever?
5070147	5071728	With all the new stuff that they're putting in?
5071868	5075829	Could very well be with the level editor and the video record feature.
5076249	5078949	And it seems like every week they keep adding new features.
5079429	5080089	Sounds pretty hot.
5080129	5081130	I know I'm excited about it.
5083010	5086431	Yeah, and then I got to try the Wii Zapper I actually had fun with.
5087211	5088451	Ah, yes, the Wii Zapper.
5088471	5088671	Okay.
5089307	5090828	That's going to be coming out pretty soon, huh?
5091048	5094689	They have Link's crossbow training there, which was pretty good, especially if you're a Zelda fan.
5095049	5101392	I have a copy on order because I've saved myself from purchasing other Wii games, so I'll be getting it.
5101412	5106514	I'm very excited to finally put the Wii Zapper bet to rest, because we still have that going on, too.
5106554	5107254	I will kick your ass.
5107274	5107794	The date bet.
5108314	5110035	So anyway, we'll worry about that later.
5111276	5113396	Mario Party DS was there.
5113416	5114437	That was also a lot of fun.
5114477	5114777	Mm-hmm.
5116634	5119535	Oh yeah, I saw Mario Party 8 this weekend, I forgot to mention.
5120236	5121256	I saw it, I didn't play it.
5121376	5123697	Because it was another Wii game that came out at the party.
5123717	5125118	It's just another Mario Party game.
5125618	5127639	I got it for my brother when I got him his Wii for his birthday.
5127659	5129640	But now you build hotels, I guess, or something.
5129880	5130180	Whatever.
5131021	5132781	One of the maps has hotels on it, or something.
5133162	5133402	Anyway.
5133982	5134702	Sorry, Shadow Next Gen.
5135183	5136083	What else is on your mind, buddy?
5138084	5138184	Um...
5139169	5144573	I just wanted to say that E4ALL wasn't nearly as bad as a lot of the reports were making it out to be.
5144593	5146355	They had about 18,000 people there, I think they said.
5149147	5152008	which is almost about a third of what E3 used to draw.
5152028	5156110	And I would say that's pretty good for a first year without Sony and Microsoft there.
5156411	5159472	Well, I'm glad to hear a dissenting opinion from someone who was actually there.
5159512	5160212	We welcome that.
5160693	5162193	What do you think, though, about next year?
5162213	5166035	Because apparently they have it timed where it's going to be very close to Penny Arcade Expo next year.
5166736	5169837	Do you think that's going to be a good thing or bad or what?
5171758	5177101	Right now, I don't really see it being too good of a move because Penny Arcade is starting to get really huge.
5177501	5177701	Mm-hmm.
5178283	5185607	I don't know why they would want to draw away more potential exhibitors who would probably rather go up to Seattle.
5187268	5188329	Yeah, it's going to be interesting.
5188349	5190090	We'll have to wait and see.
5190110	5194833	Hopefully they'll smarten up and either they'll put it in October again or they'll put it earlier in the year.
5195213	5198955	They might be playing a game of chicken right now to see if anybody backs down first, but we will see.
5199696	5200336	Anyway, shout out next time.
5200356	5201077	We've got to let you go.
5201177	5203858	We're going to try to wrap things up for tonight, but thanks so much for your call.
5205399	5206160	All right, have a good night, guys.
5206180	5206620	All right, you too.
5207892	5212395	It's good to hear from somebody who's actually there, as opposed to all the hearsay on the internet.
5213055	5215116	I'm so sorry to those folks that didn't get through tonight.
5215156	5223181	I know we have more people that wanted to call in, but sadly, we've got to get this show wrapped up, because we are going on a three-hour program tonight, and we've got to wrap this shit up.
5223241	5226963	So, Loki, did you have anything else for Last Minute Stories?
5227123	5227803	Yeah, real quick.
5228004	5233026	I was going to say, Heavenly Star is going to be in No More Heroes as well, as a song, apparently.
5233707	5236609	I don't know, it should be pretty interesting.
5236629	5236869	I guess...
5238393	5241254	You find a hidden VHS tape in the game or something.
5241855	5242555	Well, it's kind of weird.
5244096	5245096	Then, let's see here.
5246297	5247917	I laughed when I read this story.
5248498	5255561	Apparently, they were going to do some Assassin's Creed novels that were going to come out around the same time as the game.
5256721	5263965	But apparently, a sect of real-life assassins paid Ubisoft to visit and told them no.
5266426	5266706	I don't know.
5268160	5269742	I laughed at that.
5269982	5281113	Then there was an interview with Naughty Dog about Uncharted where they said that they've only used 30% of the PS3's power for Uncharted.
5281353	5283135	So if the game sucks that's why.
5285157	5285958	Let's see here.
5287641	5299051	And then finally, Nintendo was also, the PR manager with Nintendo was interviewed regarding a couple things, including a hard drive and friend codes.
5299912	5308539	Eric Walter, of course, revealed no plans for a Wii hard drive, despite the fact that the whole WiiWare service is going to be coming.
5308939	5313103	And also, as far as the friends codes...
5313473	5324980	Apparently, they've pulled people through different questionnaires and whatnot, and people don't seem to be... They are undisturbed by them, so they're going to stay.
5326601	5327301	Hooray!
5328082	5331464	I do want to add to the last minute news to follow up to our breaking news earlier.
5332024	5333865	The character battle is over, and it's official.
5333985	5337047	El Block is the new champion after the character battle.
5337687	5340329	And now they're having an extra bonus round.
5341112	5347615	and today the L Block is facing off against the Paddle, the Question Mark Block, and the Weighted Companion Cube.
5348536	5349656	Oh, they're all doing battles.
5351057	5354098	I can already tell the Weighted Companion Cube is going to win just because it's current.
5354398	5362142	Actually, at the current time, now it is early on in the race, but at the current time, L Block is leading with almost 40% of the vote.
5362482	5365784	Weighted Companion Cube is in second place, but only with 27% of the vote.
5366404	5366984	That'll change.
5367064	5369265	I think the portal jokes are going to get old pretty soon, you guys.
5370126	5370366	Alright.
5371573	5373054	Anyhow, show is over.
5373234	5375115	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
5375155	5376295	We'll start off with Puppy.
5376335	5379177	Thank you so much for being here, and I'm glad you got to actually talk this time.
5379777	5382299	So what is your final thought?
5385260	5387961	I have cavities now from all that candy.
5388001	5388182	I know.
5388222	5389322	I need an insulin shot.
5389362	5389702	Jesus.
5390062	5392023	All right, DarkSakura, your final thought.
5392524	5394025	I fucking love my iPhone.
5395685	5400728	My final thought is I'm going to have a candy coma.
5401606	5402768	Loki, your final thought?
5403289	5405333	My final thought is I have way too many games to play this week.
5406034	5406896	And I hope my Wii works.
5407858	5408158	Alright.
5408639	5409601	The Wii console.
5409801	5410402	Thank you guys so much.
5410422	5411404	I'm not worried about my Wii.
5411625	5412687	I know that works just fine.
5413354	5413854	Okay.
5414574	5418916	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and downloading Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Independent Radio.
5418996	5432779	If you like what you hear, please tell two friends about our show or go leave us a nice review on iTunes, dang it, because we could always use some extra five-star reviews because that helps spread the word because we don't have a big magazine or website backing us.
5432819	5436520	We don't have any of those fancy magazines.
5436560	5437020	That's right.
5437040	5439441	We don't have any of that fancy schmancy stuff to back us up.
5440041	5441762	We do this because we love you all.
5441782	5442522	Expensive print material.
5443280	5445082	So, we appreciate it.
5445102	5448805	Seems like one of those fancy magazines you find at Kmart.
5450506	5450706	Sorry.
5451827	5459334	Alright, on that note, until next week, I'm Rob, that's Jamie, that's Loki, and we're Orange Lounge Radio.
5459374	5459974	See you next week.
