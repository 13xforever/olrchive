7000	13000	We the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	19000	Tonight, November 11th, 2007, Manhunt 2 disappears from Target.
19000	22000	New patch lets you play Boom Boom Rocket with your guitar.
22000	26000	And can your PlayStation 3 warranty be voided by dust?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hi everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura.
47000	48000	Hi.
48000	49000	How are you doing, Dark Sakura?
49000	52000	I've been fed now. I'm feeling a lot better.
52000	56000	You're full of burrito from one of our local joints, Aldebare Toast.
56000	58000	I'm not really supposed to be eating that.
58000	59000	Is this horchata?
59000	60000	No, it's Diet Coke.
60000	61000	I love horchata.
61000	67000	I love horchata too, however, because this is pretty much the only other thing I've eaten today.
67000	69000	I figured a burrito wouldn't kill me.
69000	72000	Horchata's probably not very good for you because they taste like liquid churros.
72000	74000	Oh my god, they're so good though.
74000	79000	For anyone who doesn't know what an horchata is, it's a sweet rice drink.
79000	81000	It's delicious. It tastes like liquid churro.
81000	83000	It's got cinnamon in it. It's really delicious.
83000	84000	Good times.
84000	89000	But the only other thing I had today was a low-carb tortilla with peanut butter on it.
89000	93000	And I wasn't hungry after that. I was like, wow, I'm so not hungry.
93000	94000	It's because peanut butter is awesome.
94000	97000	And then I started getting hungry right before I had to leave the house.
97000	101000	And then I started getting sleepy too, so I had caffeine and food.
101000	103000	Here we go turning into the food cast again.
103000	106000	Why is it at the beginning of every episode of Orange on the Radio or like the food cast?
106000	109000	Because I always bring in my dinner and you have to comment on it.
109000	112000	I'm just jealous because I'm hungry.
112000	114000	I haven't really eaten.
114000	116000	So, I ate a little bit.
116000	117000	I have Belgian chocolate too.
117000	119000	I'm going to make you some spaghetti, Rob.
119000	120000	Do you have spaghetti?
120000	121000	A spaghetti.
121000	122000	All right.
122000	126000	Joining us as well, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
126000	127000	Hello.
127000	128000	How are you doing, Loki?
128000	129000	Doing good.
129000	130000	Awesome.
130000	132000	What have you been playing over there on the PSP?
132000	136000	I was yelling at Loki just before the show to turn it down because I couldn't hear the regular stuff
136000	139000	because I was being distracted by the PSP.
139000	140000	What are you playing on the PSP, Loki?
140000	141000	Silent Hill Origins.
141000	142000	Nice.
142000	143000	Good times?
143000	144000	Is it fun?
144000	145000	Yeah, it's pretty good.
145000	146000	Awesome.
146000	148000	Well, I'm sure we will hear more about that during the How Is Your Gaming Week,
148000	149000	which is our first segment we always get into.
149000	151000	Unfortunately, no guests in the studio tonight.
151000	152000	It's just the three of us.
152000	155000	But that's okay because we always have our fourth guest.
155000	156000	No, we love the guests.
156000	158000	But many of them are having birthdays this week.
158000	160000	I'll get to that in just a little bit.
160000	164000	For now, I want to introduce the ever-present other guest on our program.
164000	167000	It's all of you in our chat room, chat.orangelandtrader.com,
167000	170000	for those of you guys that join us live when we tape on Sunday nights.
170000	173000	I understand there's some new folks in chat tonight.
173000	179000	Joel Nier said he or she was new when they joined, so welcome, newbie.
179000	183000	And I'm not sure if we have any other newbies, but welcome to all the newbies in chat.
183000	184000	We like new people.
184000	186000	All right, let's start off with How Is Your Gaming Week.
186000	187000	Oh, wait.
187000	189000	Oh, Dark Cyber's mouth is full of burrito and is unable to.
189000	191000	I don't talk with my mouth full.
191000	192000	That's good.
192000	193000	I'm glad you have manners.
193000	195000	Like, a certain coworker of mine does.
195000	196000	Oh, my God.
196000	198000	Okay, that's getting to eff yous.
198000	203000	This week, I was playing Cooking Mama.
203000	205000	I'm playing Eating Mama.
205000	211000	Anyway, my gaming week, I actually did something other than Ragnarok.
211000	214000	I look like I had to play a shitload of Ragnarok, but still.
214000	223000	I got a level from zero, of course being Uber Noob, to, I think, 82 in three days.
223000	224000	Nerd.
224000	226000	It doesn't matter.
226000	230000	So, anyway, I also played slash watched.
230000	233000	I played a little watched a lot of Portal.
233000	239000	Finally, and I've seen the ending, it's fucked up, and I love it.
239000	245000	So, Dan's going to rent it for me from his store, because the good thing about being
245000	248000	a manager at GameCrazy is that he can get me free rentals at Hollywood Video.
248000	250000	So, he's just going to bring me home Portal one day.
250000	253000	And he said he was going to laugh at me when I got really motion sick.
253000	256000	I was like, uh-uh, I'm going to stop every two levels.
256000	257000	Take a little breather.
257000	259000	Of course, it's like such a quick game.
259000	263000	It's like, wow, this is three hours of quick.
263000	267000	Well, you know that is good gaming ethics, is that you're actually supposed to, if you
267000	271000	actually read an instruction manual, it says like you're supposed to take a break of 10
271000	273000	to 15 minutes for every like two hours of gameplay.
273000	275000	That's not really ethics.
275000	276000	That's self-care.
276000	278000	How many folks really do, you're right, it's not really ethics.
278000	279000	I don't know where I pulled that word from.
279000	282000	Ethics is not unplugging somebody else's controller.
282000	283000	Exactly.
283000	286000	When they're kicking your ass at Street Fighter.
286000	289000	Which I've done, but I'm not an ethical gamer.
289000	290000	Anyway.
290000	295000	But I want one of those shirts that they're plugging in the chat room.
295000	297000	Yeah, Tiger Claw is plugging a cake is a lie t-shirt.
297000	299000	But they don't have girly shirts.
299000	301000	They don't have them girl cut.
301000	302000	Oh, that sucks.
302000	303000	Yeah.
303000	304000	Wear a boy's shirt.
304000	305000	Girls can get away with that.
305000	307000	It looks weird, though, if you've got big boobs.
307000	311000	Because you either have to get one that's really way too tight and uncomfortable.
311000	317000	So if you have big boobs, then your shirt says, the cake is a lie.
317000	322000	Otherwise, you have to get one that's too big and looks all dumpy.
322000	325000	But my friend, though, has the best t-shirt ever.
325000	326000	I have to share this with everybody.
326000	328000	She has a shirt with two 20-sided die on.
328000	329000	It's set to 20.
329000	331000	And says, yes, they're natural.
331000	332000	Nice.
332000	336000	I went to see my friend Becky yesterday.
336000	343000	This is where I watched a whole bunch of Portal as we went over to a party that had cheesecake.
343000	346000	So I was going around all day saying the cheesecake was a lie.
346000	347000	So that I wouldn't eat any.
347000	350000	I'm surprised no one's had a Portal party yet.
350000	353000	What they need to do is record the little music that's playing on the radio in there.
353000	354000	I know.
354000	356000	And just blast it on little radios.
356000	359000	A Portal party, yay.
359000	363000	And you could actually probably easily make one of the...
363000	367000	That's what I'm going to do for my next cosplay.
367000	371000	Don't you think that cosplay for Portal characters and stuff is going to be really popular, though?
371000	372000	I think it's...
372000	373000	I'm just going to carry one of those little...
373000	376000	Team Fortress 2, I think, is going to be popular.
376000	380000	I'm just going to carry one of those eyeball things around.
380000	383000	Or a weighted companion cube.
383000	387000	Everybody, you're invited to our Portal party.
387000	389000	Dress up like your favorite character.
389000	390000	It'll be fun.
390000	391000	What?
391000	392000	All two of them?
392000	393000	Or three?
393000	397000	And the only time you actually see your character is you happen to be looking through another Portal.
397000	398000	Which is kind of...
398000	399000	Oh my God, though.
399000	402000	There's one part I got so nauseous.
402000	403000	It's like this...
403000	405000	I'm trying to remember exactly...
405000	406000	Oh, I want one.
406000	408000	That's so cute.
408000	410000	A little plushy companion cube?
410000	411000	I want one, totally.
411000	412000	But anyway, it's this one part...
412000	421000	And I don't remember exactly the puzzle, but you're trying to build up enough speed to jump across from one of the slanted platforms on top to the other side.
421000	425000	And so you have to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and then shoot the other Portal and go through it so that you got enough momentum.
425000	427000	And I got so freaking sick.
427000	429000	I had to leave my room, but that was about it.
429000	433000	You should try to get the achievement for the 30,000 foot drop or whatever.
433000	434000	That'll make you sick.
434000	436000	You have to drop for six minutes.
436000	443000	This was on a laptop, so the resolution was so high that it really, really bugged me.
443000	445000	But it was very good.
445000	447000	So anything else for your gaming week?
447000	449000	I played World Cup Soccer in 1994.
449000	450000	Pinball?
450000	451000	Goal!
451000	452000	Good times.
452000	453000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
453000	457000	My gaming week was pretty full, actually.
457000	460000	Okay, so I did play Portal as well.
460000	461000	I finished it as well.
461000	465000	I also finished all the advanced levels, so that was fun.
465000	470000	I like the little ball you get in one of those, too, that you have to carry it around.
470000	475000	It's a level where you have the companion cube, but when you're playing advanced, it's like a little ball that bounces.
475000	478000	So it rolls around and stuff.
478000	480000	Not real fun.
480000	485000	I do have to add that I love the automated weapons.
485000	486000	Oh, yeah.
486000	487000	What'd they say?
487000	488000	Yeah, they're cute.
488000	489000	Sorry.
489000	491000	Should I have a trash can that does that?
491000	492000	That'd be cool.
492000	500000	Anyways, ooh, they should make an automated one like that that shoots those soft pellet things.
500000	501000	Yeah.
501000	502000	That would be great.
502000	503000	Or Nerf.
503000	504000	Yeah.
504000	507000	Okay, anyways, let's see.
507000	515000	Other things I played, Super Mario Galaxy, just flat out the best game for the Wii.
515000	516000	I mean, that's it.
516000	518000	It's the best Mario game I've played.
518000	521000	It feels very, very, very much like Mario 64.
521000	522000	The control's awesome.
522000	524000	Looks awesome.
524000	526000	You gotta buy it if you own a Wii.
526000	531000	And if you don't own a Wii, you gotta buy a Wii so you can buy the game.
531000	535000	Then I played, what else did I play here?
535000	536000	Coruscant's Pro.
536000	539000	I played lots of that.
539000	542000	Silent Hill Origins, just started that a little bit.
542000	544000	Looks very, very good on a PSP.
544000	545000	Very surprised.
545000	549000	The smoke and fog looks amazing.
549000	550000	But it's gonna be a great game.
550000	554000	A lot of the reviews have said people like this out of the entire series.
554000	556000	Probably the best game.
556000	561000	Another game I played that a lot of people are dying to get their hands on is Assassin's Creed.
561000	564000	And that one's a pretty unique game.
564000	570000	When you first start it, you're gonna understand why it's a little different than a lot of people had thought.
570000	574000	A lot of weird sci-fi stuff in it, that's for sure.
574000	576000	But it looks awesome.
576000	578000	It controls very easy.
578000	581000	It's gonna be a great game.
581000	588000	But the game I've been playing most this week, especially on the Wii, not Super Mario Galaxy, actually.
588000	591000	Ghost Squad on the Wii.
591000	594000	Probably the weirdest, dumbest shooter ever, but you gotta buy it.
594000	597000	It's gonna be like 30 bucks, comes out in a couple weeks.
597000	599000	I've been playing the Japanese version, which is all in English anyways.
599000	601000	But it is fun.
601000	603000	We've beat the game like three times today.
603000	608000	And as you beat the game, you get experience points and you unlock new weapons that make the game harder.
608000	610000	What exactly do you do in this game?
610000	612000	It's just like time crisis.
612000	614000	It's just, you know, shooting stuff.
614000	617000	And it's just so cheesy and stupid, though.
617000	620000	But as you finish the game, you also unlock different levels.
620000	624000	Or the levels get harder and they have different things that they add in there.
624000	626000	Works very well with the Wii Remote.
626000	628000	Great gun game.
628000	630000	Highly recommend it.
630000	634000	It's a good game to spend like, you know, 50 bucks on Resident Evil.
634000	636000	Ghost Squad, definitely a good one to pick up.
636000	640000	It also does support the Wii Zapper, although I don't have a Wii Zapper.
640000	643000	And as far as I can tell, it only uses the remotes.
643000	646000	So I don't know why the hell you would use a Wii Zapper with this anyways.
646000	649000	But you can, I guess.
649000	657000	And then the last game I played, which is really crappy, is a game called Counter Force on the Wii.
657000	660000	You might not have heard of it, and that's probably a good thing.
660000	665000	It's people compared to, I guess, Star Fox, but it's no way near Star Fox.
665000	669000	It is just a pile of shit, and you shouldn't play it.
669000	672000	And I feel sorry for all the customers I sold that to.
672000	673000	Is it Shit Force?
673000	675000	It's just, it's crap.
675000	677000	Crap Force.
677000	679000	Why is it crap?
679000	680000	Shovelware, I guess.
680000	682000	Why is it crap? I'm trying to get people to elaborate.
682000	685000	Why is it crap? The graphics are very simple, very stupid.
685000	687000	It doesn't control very well.
687000	690000	It looks like it's thrown together really quick, almost like in Flash.
690000	694000	It's just, I mean, a perfect example.
694000	700000	There's a, in the very beginning one, you know how you pull up the title in a disc menu or whatever?
700000	703000	It says Counter Force, and it has, you know, the company that made it.
703000	707000	Well, there's this period out in the middle of nowhere because they didn't format it, right?
707000	710000	And so the period's kind of moved over to the next line or something.
710000	715000	It's just, it's really cheap looking, and it is a cheap game, so.
715000	716000	I don't know.
716000	720000	From the makers of such wonderful games as Ninja Bread Man,
720000	727000	Anubis 2, and Billy the Wizard, Rocket Boomstick Racing,
727000	730000	no, we are not ripping off of Harry Potter, even though we are.
730000	731000	Yeah.
731000	733000	That's a pretty impressive lineup, I don't know.
733000	737000	I just played it because I knew it was going to be crap,
737000	740000	and it's even crappier than I thought it was, so.
740000	743000	Odd1InChat, at chat.onechonserator.com, says,
743000	746000	Dumb shooters FTW, so agrees with your assessment of Ghost Squad.
746000	747000	Okay, let me put it this way.
747000	751000	Ghost Squad, as you play it, you unlock more stuff, like I said, weapons and stuff,
751000	755000	but later on, I'm not even sure where in the game,
755000	760000	but later on, you get it so ridiculous where all the enemies are bikini-clad chicks.
760000	765000	You're shooting a dolphin squirt gun at them instead of an actual gun.
765000	769000	You can stealth kill somebody instead with a knife, with a banana,
769000	777000	and they're pursuing you in swan-shaped paddle boats instead of jet skis.
777000	778000	I mean, that's hilarious.
778000	781000	Suddenly, the chatroom is turned to talk about Ninja Bread Man.
781000	785000	We have Gerardimo in chat says, Ninja Bread Man FTW.
785000	788000	Odd1 says, I got to love those guys just for the name Ninja Bread Man,
788000	792000	and ActDeaf descents and says, Ninja Bread Man looks crappy.
792000	794000	I totally need one.
794000	796000	There you have it.
796000	799000	Anything else you played this week?
799000	803000	Actually, I did play one thing, but I don't really have much of an impression for it.
803000	809000	Forever Blue, it's an underwater scuba diving sim for the Wii.
809000	810000	It looks pretty.
810000	812000	I guess it's sort of like Pokemon Snap.
812000	815000	Unfortunately, the version I played was all in Japanese,
815000	820000	and I'm trying to get my hands on an English copy so I can actually understand what's going on.
820000	824000	But you can play your own MP3s on it, like Excite Truck, so that's kind of cool.
824000	828000	Except the MP3s I had in my cart at the time were from Excite Truck,
828000	834000	so it didn't really fit the underwater Enya that they have normal playing in the game.
834000	841000	Instead, I have some rock and roll stuff, like paranoia something.
841000	843000	I don't know.
843000	844000	It was fine.
844000	845000	Nice.
845000	847000	Let's see, so my gaming week then, if you're all finished.
847000	848000	I'm done.
848000	849000	Let's see, what did I play this week?
849000	851000	I played a little bit of World of Warcraft.
851000	854000	I also kind of got sucked back into Final Fantasy XI a little bit.
854000	855000	I've been leveling...
855000	856000	Hi.
856000	857000	Hi, Jamie.
857000	858000	Is there anything you want to say to that?
858000	859000	Hi, Rob.
859000	861000	No, I already gave you health for it the other day.
861000	865000	I've been leveling Corsair in Final Fantasy XI, and Corsairs are awesome.
865000	870000	Actually, I've decided that if I'm going to like Final Fantasy XI again,
870000	872000	I am going to not play by the rules,
872000	875000	because one thing that totally pissed me off about Final Fantasy XI is that people were like,
875000	879000	well, if you're a Paladin, you have to sub Warrior, because you have to have Voke,
879000	883000	and if you're a White Mage, you really have to sub Black Mage, or maybe Summoner.
883000	886000	There's all these freaking unsaid rules.
886000	887000	You have to have this equipment.
887000	888000	You have to.
888000	889000	F that noise.
889000	891000	I am going to play this game how I want.
891000	895000	Therefore, I am going to be a Corsair Bard, because I like to buff people,
895000	897000	and both those classes are all about buffing people.
897000	900000	Corsairs are awesome because they're based around gambling,
900000	902000	and Bards are awesome because they sing.
902000	905000	Basically, my character is a tacky Las Vegas nightclub act,
905000	907000	because I gamble and I sing.
907000	908000	It's awesome.
908000	912000	If I played that again, I would totally play a White Mage Monk.
912000	913000	Good times.
913000	916000	See, we should just have a party of people playing whatever the hell they want.
916000	918000	But that makes sense, though, a White Mage and a Monk.
918000	920000	Let's see.
920000	923000	Dark Tetsuya says Rob likes to buff people.
923000	925000	Very funny jerk.
925000	927000	What are you laughing at?
927000	928000	Oh, what?
928000	930000	You have an aim chatter with a comment?
930000	931000	I couldn't read it.
931000	932000	What's it say?
932000	933000	Rob likes to buff people.
933000	934000	Buff people.
934000	935000	Shut up.
935000	936000	Shut up.
936000	937000	Let's see.
937000	938000	So I've been playing a lot of that.
938000	942000	I actually took Corsair from level 10 to level 17 in just a matter of days,
942000	944000	so that should tell you about how much I was playing.
944000	946000	I also was playing on the Nintendo Wii a little bit,
946000	949000	because I was looking for the Check Me Out channel.
949000	952000	It wasn't there yet, but I did download Super Mario Bros. 3,
952000	955000	and I was playing a little bit of that, because that is a classic game.
955000	956000	But I'll tell you what.
956000	958000	When you play Super Mario Bros. 3,
958000	963000	if you're playing on a widescreen TV and you have it scrunched in,
963000	968000	you can see a lot of the graphical glitches that you didn't see back in the day on your regular TV,
968000	972000	because the sides of the screen were cut off by your TV.
972000	975000	You know how the old TVs have that rounded-ish screen,
975000	977000	so you didn't really see the sides?
977000	980000	There's hella graphical glitches in Super Mario Bros. 3.
980000	981000	I never really realized.
981000	983000	I remember there being some, but it's all right.
983000	986000	It's still a fantabulous game, so it's great.
986000	987000	I need to buy Simon's Quest as well.
987000	989000	I think you should bring Super Mario Bros. 3 on...
989000	991000	Well, I know they already have it on Game Boy Advance and stuff,
991000	993000	but do a new version on the DS,
993000	996000	and have it randomly glitch out every now and then,
996000	1002000	and you have to blow into your DS microphone to clean the cartridge out.
1002000	1003000	That would be great.
1003000	1007000	That would be the authentic Super Mario Bros. experience.
1007000	1008000	Jolnir in chat is asking,
1008000	1010000	What about the new dancer job of Final Fantasy XI?
1010000	1012000	I am excited for the new jobs.
1012000	1013000	I think scholar and dancer look good.
1013000	1015000	I hope there's a third one.
1015000	1017000	I would love to see Geomancer or something,
1017000	1018000	but I hear it's not going to happen.
1018000	1020000	It's only going to be the two.
1020000	1023000	My buddy Shane, who you've probably heard on the show,
1023000	1024000	I don't know. There's only the two.
1024000	1026000	They're going to say it's only the two jobs.
1026000	1027000	Well, dancer and what's the other one?
1027000	1029000	Scholar is the other one.
1029000	1030000	What the fuck's scholar?
1030000	1032000	Scholar was kind of obscure.
1032000	1033000	I think scholar was in Final Fantasy.
1033000	1034000	I'm smart.
1034000	1036000	Well, that's not going to help you in fighting enemies.
1036000	1039000	Scholar is a combination of white mage and black mage,
1039000	1040000	but they're not a red mage.
1040000	1043000	They use what's called, I think it's called grimoire or something.
1043000	1047000	They use this to basically strengthen the white magic
1047000	1051000	and weaken the black magic if you use a white scholar or a white grimoire
1051000	1054000	or there's the black one that will strengthen the black magic
1054000	1056000	and weaken the white magic, and they have their own unique spells.
1056000	1058000	So there's support for the support?
1058000	1060000	Sort of. The rumor is they get the reflect spell.
1060000	1063000	They're going to have reflect, which is a spell that's missing from the game.
1063000	1066000	So then they're going to basically be like the...
1066000	1072000	For lack of a better description, like the ones that reflect the enemy.
1072000	1075440	well look here's what it really is is that the scholar artifact armor which is
1075440	1076580	like the endgame honor
1076580	1080500	armor is a school outfit so now you can actually be a Japanese schoolgirl in the
1080500	1081760	game so that's
1081760	1085120	that look let's just let's just go to the reality of yay job
1085120	1089480	Japanese schoolgirls everywhere so I'm guessing that we're gonna see lots of
1089480	1091360	I'll
1091360	1094760	damn I've been out of Final Fantasy way too long serious mythra's
1094760	1098400	too many mythra scholars in schoolgirl outfits
1098400	1101960	be wonderful anyhow and then they could be
1101960	1106000	asking for honestly I am looking more forward to galka dancers
1106000	1109360	mythra scholar I'm dancers
1109360	1112360	then that way they can be you know strippers right
1112360	1118400	enough about a Final Fantasy love it I would say
1118400	1121440	I'm what else I played on xbox I've been playing guitar here we had people over
1121440	1122440	here last night because
1122440	1126000	the night started at John's incredible pizza which is this chain
1126000	1129360	I think mostly only exists in central California like Fresno I think is where
1129360	1129880	it started
1129880	1133000	but now it's up here in Roseville they have one our shows based out of
1133000	1134560	Sacramento Roseville being a suburb
1134560	1138720	I sometimes forget we have people all around the listen so anyway
1138720	1141880	we're at this John's incredible pizza which is basically like a Dave and Busters for kids
1141880	1143200	they have a big pizza buffet
1143200	1147040	and like then they have this game room they actually have rides in the joint
1147040	1150720	eat this place used to be a Sam's Club and they totally converted into this
1150720	1152080	ginormous pizza place
1152080	1155040	but they have video games and we started the night playing I was playing DDR
1155040	1155840	Supernova
1155840	1159400	and my boyfriend William is so hilarious because while I was playing
1159400	1163120	this like lady in her probably her mid-thirties came up and she was
1163120	1164880	watching me play she's like wow
1164880	1168480	I wanna get this game for my kids and William is like totally selling the lady
1168480	1169560	on this game he's like
1169560	1172680	yeah like you see what he's doing is when the arrows go to the top of the
1172680	1176000	screen he steps on it's just so funny Konami should be paying his so good at
1176000	1177000	selling stuff too
1177000	1180160	he is he just will make you believe anything
1180160	1183400	you should have a cult he totally could like sell
1183400	1186920	like games or anything like William could have his own cult yes
1186920	1190440	he's great I one of these days I will let him come on the show and so that
1190440	1192240	would be fantastic he's hilarious
1192240	1196560	so he was very funny at dinner by the way he's the best he's the best anyway
1196560	1201040	yeah they're all in central California I need to I need to stop gushing so much
1201040	1201440	anyway
1201440	1205880	I here's the other thing about John's Incredible Pizza that I thought was
1205880	1209560	hilarious is that it pretty much outside of DDR in some random shooter games
1209560	1214200	it was all ticket games like you know gambling for kids basically right
1214200	1219080	but my god ticket games have come a long way since I was a kid
1219080	1222360	like I remember when I was a kid it was all about whack-a-mole like if the
1222360	1224720	Chuck E. Cheese had whack-a-mole that was the shit right
1224720	1227640	and like you play that with your hands and stuff not just a big mallet but your friends
1227640	1228280	would play too
1228280	1232640	now they have deal or no deal but with tickets
1232640	1237240	and you actually play this game and like the banker offers you like 50 tickets
1237240	1241400	to buy out your case or whatever because basically the show but with tickets I
1241400	1242920	couldn't believe it I was like floored
1242920	1246320	but then this place had rides in it like it had a roller coaster inside which I
1246320	1247240	thought was crazy
1247240	1252520	kind of a fun little place I'm sure they'll do well. Gerardo says deal or no
1252520	1254200	deal is too expensive to play
1254200	1257200	Act F says yay gambling is good for you
1257200	1260760	GS68 says jump in jackpot dude this place had not one
1260760	1265480	but two jump in jackpot machines and for those in New York City that went when I
1265480	1267320	was there we had the OLR meetup
1267320	1270560	I got further in jumping jackpot than I ever have before I don't know if the machine
1270560	1271840	was set to an easier difficulty
1271840	1275680	but I got all the way to like the O in jackpot and then I lost I was so
1275680	1276280	pissed
1276280	1279960	anyhow jump in jackpot is that jump rope game
1279960	1283200	with the random eurobeat music that sounds like flame in finger
1283200	1286800	I've never seen it but I love flame in finger. We are going to this place
1286800	1290680	but on a weeknight because I was pissed because the place is out of beer mugs
1290680	1292040	how do you run out of beer mugs
1292040	1295720	well go after my pay day we will and then I'm gonna buy that t-shirt
1295720	1299200	awesome the cake is a lie shirt yes good times
1299200	1303000	so what was I gonna say oh yes so since they were out of beer mugs the idea was to come
1303000	1305760	back to my place and drink so everybody came over those of us that went out
1305760	1306920	there's about seven of us that went out
1306920	1310640	and we came back here we played guitar hero and everybody was learning how to
1310640	1313680	play William played for the first time and some other people I just met were
1313680	1315520	playing for the first time we were all having a good time
1315520	1318560	so guitar hero great party game even though I only have one guitar
1318560	1321840	but I've been playing through that I finally got some achievements for getting all the five
1321840	1322720	stars on medium
1322720	1326920	and now I'm finally working on hard and expert songs and it's hard
1326920	1330600	you know I could come over one day and bring one of my controllers
1330600	1333640	you should we should rock out do some co-op be fun
1333640	1337000	I want rock bands so much and I do want to say this
1337000	1340920	that Dragonforce song is the fucking shit I'd love that song
1340920	1344360	seriously but here's the thing I noticed about Dragonforce like I was like so
1344360	1345000	like
1345000	1349280	into that song even though playing it sucks like I was so into that song
1349280	1353400	I went and looked them up on iTunes and seriously all of their songs sound
1353400	1354840	exactly the same yeah
1354840	1358360	my friend has about a CD of them they're awesome wait I'm gonna
1358360	1362680	hold on I'm gonna look them up on the store real quick
1362680	1366280	and play some of this for you guys I don't know how well it's gonna run
1366280	1369640	though because we have the webcam going so it's kinda slow
1369640	1373320	that's pretty much all I want to say about my gaming week
1373320	1375960	anything anybody else want to add anything on their gaming weeks before we
1375960	1378040	move on
1378040	1381320	um no okay okay here's

1468280	1471720	you know oh god that's so crazy cry for eternity hold on one more
1471720	1476840	one more this band is awesome
1480680	1483320	that's cool
1483320	1486920	well there's a drummer doesn't have to have any talent
1486920	1493640	I mean wait can you imagine what these concerts must be like
1493640	1500760	like people die it'd be like a it'd be like a um death clock uh
1500760	1504840	concert dragon force is like one of my new favorite bands seriously
1504840	1508360	you hear however I will tell you why Guitar Hero 3 pisses me off as well as
1508360	1513880	rock band you know why these games piss me off lack of journey you know what I
1513880	1517640	think that you know what band really needs to be in Guitar Hero
1517640	1523160	it's freaking dream theater just find something by dream theater
1523160	1525800	they're great and it's like some of the best
1525800	1531160	guitar in the universe and they're not in Guitar Hero
1531160	1536920	um azhp says most relaxing game ever plus dragon force equals win
1536920	1541640	that is the perfect music for you put that in your little like
1541640	1544920	ocean exploring game
1547800	1552520	it should be like a katamari game for real um carizzle says I would be all
1552520	1555800	over a dragon force downloadable content pack for Guitar Hero 3
1555800	1559000	I refuse to pay the high prices but I would just have to if they came out with
1559000	1561960	the dragon force pack I bought the foo fighters one what can I
1561960	1565640	say I like riders what we need to do is we need to do a video segment
1565640	1568840	crappy games that are made better through dragon force
1568840	1573960	I love this idea I love this idea I fully support that thought crappy games
1573960	1577320	made better with the music of dragon force this is a brilliant idea
1577320	1579960	patent pending nobody better copy that shit because we're going to put it out
1579960	1583400	there on the internet love it what would be what would be a crappy
1583400	1586520	game we can make better with with music from dragon force
1586520	1590040	barbie island princess
1590440	1594520	actually I don't think that has custom soundtracks is not a 360 but like well
1594520	1598200	it doesn't matter what game because like you can turn the eva pinata party
1598200	1601560	animals yes because it has racing fusion frenzy

1764520	1767240	park no i don't watch tv it was a parody of
1767240	1771320	guitar hero and it was kind of funny like it wasn't lol funny but it was you
1771320	1774200	know haha uh it was like a parody of rock
1774200	1777800	superstardom but with guitar hero but i'll tell you what the funniest part
1777800	1781160	was the very end when stan and kyle are finally reunited
1781160	1784360	and they uh are gonna break a million points in guitar hero jamie you'll get a
1784360	1796760	kick out of this
1796760	1802040	they did it oh my sweet jesus you have played guitar hero enough to
1802040	1819080	reach 1 million points congratulations that's it
1819080	1822680	now you think i would be offended or something but seriously that shit's
1822680	1824840	hilarious like i was on the ground laughing
1824840	1828600	but the funniest part was my roommate walked in and he hadn't seen any of the
1828600	1831960	episode he just saw like the very end and when he saw that his and he's
1831960	1834920	watched me play guitar hero like tons throughout the day his jaw was just
1834920	1837800	like on the ground like i can't believe they just said that
1837800	1843480	but it was funny i totally want an icon of their expressions in that picture
1843800	1849320	you are fags that was awesome
1850360	1854920	anyhow let's get into tonight's oh wait really quickly one more housekeeping
1854920	1858120	thing i'm so horrible this week marks the fifth
1858120	1861880	anniversary of xbox live can you believe it november 15th is the day that
1861880	1865640	xbox live turns five which made me think this week one we're
1865640	1869640	older than xbox live because we're five and a half years old
1869640	1872760	but still we were here from the beginning rock on
1872760	1876040	for xbox live turning five this week and they're doing like all these types of
1876040	1878120	contests and who knows what other kind of crap
1878120	1883960	is going to be up on xbox like cool you know uh retrospective stuff and
1883960	1888280	maybe some new trailers and icons and backgrounds and
1888280	1890440	i'm sure they're going to celebrate over there
1890440	1894440	the reason why i say that is that xbox live is very good with the community
1894440	1897960	you know like out of probably the big three nintendo sony microsoft microsoft
1897960	1901000	is very good with the community and i think therefore
1901000	1903320	the community should support them for you know
1903320	1906600	um reaching out and caring about the independent scene
1906600	1911320	so hurrah to you guys at xbox speaking of xbox let's get into tonight's gaming
1911320	1916360	news loki kick it off yes so um the fall updates coming
1916360	1920360	just might not be for fall um it's actually going to be hitting
1920360	1925560	um on well sometime in december and uh one thing that will be coming with it of
1925560	1929160	course is the xbox 360 family timer of course that is going to be something
1929160	1933560	that your parents will be able to use to limit the time that kiddies get to play
1933560	1936600	um you can limit it down to like two hours
1936600	1940360	and then after those two hours up they have to play or wait 24 hours before they
1940360	1944600	can play um their xbox 360 again i think that's an
1944600	1947160	awesome idea that they're able to limit stuff like
1947160	1953000	that um playtime uh no word though what else
1953000	1957000	will be coming um on that update as well but of course
1957000	1960760	usually with those dashboard updates there's a bit more stuff on there
1960760	1965000	uh hopefully some more video playback stuff so we can play some divx maybe
1965000	1969080	xvid that would be nice good times high more high def stuff over the uh
1969080	1972520	inner or over not the internet but the local network be awesome
1972520	1976840	then i can watch my dragon force music videos be awesome they have music videos
1976840	1979880	on itunes there's some for sale and they're just as epic as you'd think
1979880	1983720	just go to youtube there you go uh last week if you're listening to last
1983720	1987960	week's show um we were kind of joking uh probably more than we needed to about
1987960	1991480	kmart remember our kmart and one thing that
1991480	1994760	came up what we're talking about is that one of the good things that kmart is
1994760	1998920	there for is that they tend to break street dates and that was totally proven
1998920	2000920	this week i would like to see did we call it or
2000920	2005640	did we call it on last week's show sure enough kmart has been spotted with
2005640	2010040	copies of mass effect uh kmart sold a copy of mass
2010040	2013800	effect it looks like in uh cropped in maryland is where they
2013800	2016040	are still going to be in trouble tomorrow
2016040	2019960	busted they're gonna get the smackdown on that and i believe that was sold
2019960	2023960	friday or yesterday uh that's 10 days before the official release date of the
2023960	2025560	game and of course the guy bought it and
2025560	2028360	promptly put a picture of it up on the internet with the receipt so you knew he
2028360	2032040	wasn't full of crap so uh everybody's saying run and check
2032040	2034360	kmart and see if this is there because you never know
2034360	2037720	i mean he's not the only one too there's another guy too off of the
2037720	2041160	cheap ass games forum i believe that um got one as well
2041160	2045400	so so there you have it if you uh want to get your games early kmart's the
2045400	2048440	place to go i forgot to check the local one but i'm sure
2048440	2052120	um a lot of the local kids already beat me to it yeah no thanks i don't want to
2052120	2056120	go to kmart i know it's i can wait no i can go there if i need
2056120	2059800	socks i do want to say though loki was showing
2059800	2064280	off the a lesbian scene that was hot it's very artistic that was
2064280	2068200	it was i like how you could respond like very artistically done let's do it again

2078760	2083160	content available for rock band um

2086360	2091880	um we've got on here um there's a police pack with rocks and synchronicity too
2091880	2096520	can't stand losing you there's a queens of stone age pack a metallica pack

2106760	2110360	fallen in love um by the buzzcocks i fought the law by
2110360	2112840	the clash and rockaway beach by the ramones it's like
2112840	2117560	classic there um then there's some uh single songs which is fortunate son by
2117560	2121400	credence clearwater revival um jukebox hero by foreigner my
2121400	2125080	charona cherry bomb i like the runaways cherry
2125080	2132680	bomb i actually have that album because it was joan jett and lita ford
2132680	2136600	and all that was great so actually that's funny
2136600	2140360	oh i was gonna say there's one that's on there uh buddy holly by weezer
2140360	2143640	i'm actually looking for the buy in that i was actually gonna say
2143640	2147800	there's one song in that as much as i love weezer but there's one song in
2147800	2152520	there that completely just makes me go haha my iron lung by radio
2152520	2155160	head i love radio head that's pretty awesome
2155160	2159320	i love radio head you know creep is in the actual game as well
2159320	2163480	i know but i love radio head but i would like to point out there is still a
2163480	2167560	distinct lack of journey in this list hey give it time give it
2167560	2170440	time i want my fucking don't stop believing damn it
2170440	2173320	maybe they're the ones maybe it's journeys fault of this stuff isn't it
2173320	2176120	maybe they're like little bitches that don't have their fucking music to be in
2176120	2178120	this game now fuck this we remember the journey
2178120	2181560	game it sucked we're just not gonna put our music in anything radio head
2181560	2185720	radio head is cool i'll take that radio head well you know i was still on the
2185720	2189720	fence about rock band and i'm like uh i don't want to spend the 170 on the
2189720	2192920	game but then i was watching some trailers online last night and
2192920	2196600	keep in mind i was kind of drunk like we drank a lot last night and we were
2196600	2199800	having the people over here to guitar hero and we were just all in here
2199800	2204760	watching the rock band footage going oh we need to get this game it looks so
2204760	2207560	high i'm definitely getting there i think i'm gonna have to get it my wife
2207560	2211160	is gonna buy it for me for christmas oh we've already decided to get it
2211160	2214440	well it looks like we're gonna have our own little band and hopefully i'll have
2214440	2219240	it early awesome uh odd one says
2219240	2223880	yes my iron lung is my fave song of the bends that is so spectacular
2223880	2227960	that is such a good although i have to say overall my my all-time
2227960	2231640	favorite radio head song is high and dry i know i was gonna say i want high and
2231640	2235880	dry don't leave me but that wouldn't be so
2235880	2239800	rock bandy yeah you know what i mean my iron lung is
2239800	2243560	probably one of the perfect ones to have in that and mac man in our chat room is
2243560	2248120	urging me to hold on to that feelings guy
2248120	2251880	i will i will i'm gonna write journeys fan club or something and
2251880	2255560	and make you know somebody who knows the band that's right
2255560	2258840	i keep forgetting we know we have a friend who we have a friend journey he
2258840	2262760	bought he gave me guitar picks from that this to happen if you're listening said
2262760	2265000	friend i need to have some words with journey
2265000	2269960	can we make that happen anyhow you get them on the show for real
2269960	2273000	we should just have a completely night dedicated to the greatest like even
2273000	2276040	though our show's about video games the hell with it we'll put it aside for a
2276040	2278200	night and talk to all the great you know guitar
2278200	2281560	bands we've always wanted to have your special just get random people on just
2281560	2284760	ask them about games you think these people don't play games i'm sure dragon
2284760	2287160	force plays a shitload of video games as does
2287160	2289800	you know journey and all these other bands what else are they going to do on
2289800	2295320	the road other than heroin anyways um
2295320	2298840	so as i mentioned last week with rock band of course
2298840	2303640	there's going to be quite a shortage with rock band this holiday season
2303640	2308280	and that also will probably be the case with guitar hero 3 in fact
2308280	2311640	uh during activisions quarterly earnings call
2311640	2317240	uh company ceo robert cotic said that there's probably there's a
2317240	2320840	probability that this holiday we won't be able to supply all the demand for
2320840	2324520	every platform while a probability isn't quite on
2324520	2327880	par with of course the you know comment from
2327880	2330760	ea saying that there's really not going to be a lot out there
2330760	2333960	um there's a pretty good chance it's going to be hard to find
2333960	2337160	and from the other side that i you know of course
2337160	2341000	my work side i can definitely say that there's one hell of a shortage on
2341000	2345400	guitar hero already so don't be surprised there's a part of me that
2345400	2348360	can't help but wonder if this is a little bit intentional you know what i
2348360	2351480	mean like isn't it just a coincidence that rock band is going to be in short
2351480	2353720	supply and i'll tell you why short supply i'll
2353720	2359000	tell you why they're like that and it's only in short supply um in one
2359000	2363240	one way because the bundles that come with the new guitars
2363240	2367320	are in short supply it's because these new designs for the guitars and stuff
2367320	2372200	don't get finalized until it's too late same reason with rock band that's why
2372200	2375800	the bundle for rock band is hard to find or going to
2375800	2379240	be hard to find because they didn't finalize the design until it's too late
2379240	2383240	same with um guitar hero 3 one thing that they're doing to kind of to help
2383240	2386200	alleviate this if you don't give a shit about having a wireless guitar
2386200	2389880	they will sell specialized bundles for retailers that
2389880	2393080	come with the explorer guitar from guitar hero 2
2393080	2396760	those are going to be readily available but it's just getting the game with that
2396760	2400200	new guitar is going to be hard to find so if you don't care about having a new
2400200	2402200	guitar i mean because to be honest it's wireless
2402200	2405240	big deal you know the wired one works just fine
2405240	2411240	but you know if that's the case then get the game by itself by guitar later
2411240	2414120	but that that's the thing that's why it's because of these new instruments
2414120	2417640	and i bet you anything if they change the design of the guitar for guitar hero
2417640	2422440	4 we're going to be talking about this all over again so that's why
2422440	2428280	well thank you for that report well uh if you have guitar hero 3 there's
2428280	2430920	already some downloadable content available for it like i mentioned
2430920	2433560	earlier i downloaded the foo fighters pack for the game
2433560	2437400	uh that is up and running when the foo fighters pack has the pretender
2437400	2440680	all my life and the classic this is a call it was like the very first single i
2440680	2443000	think although you know what it was sadly
2443000	2446920	missing was a ever long but i think that song was in guitar hero 2 so i think
2446920	2450600	that's why b big me that's that song was awesome it
2450600	2453400	had the mentos in the video remember that back when mtv
2453400	2457080	played videos velvet revolver also has a pack of their
2457080	2460040	own i didn't buy it yet because i'm not as familiar with velvet revolver but
2460040	2463960	maybe i i hear they actually put trailers on xbox live of these packs
2463960	2467080	so you could hear the songs beforehand which is great i think it was a great
2467080	2470200	way to kind of answer that demand of we want to hear this shit before we buy it
2470200	2474360	so props to microsoft for getting around that um but velvet revolver if you uh do
2474360	2476120	want to buy that if you're a fan of the band
2476120	2478760	because i do believe velvet revolver is the band that's made up of it wasn't
2478760	2481000	that stone temple pilots plus uh the guy from sound garden
2481000	2484440	i do believe that chris cornell chris cornell has
2484440	2489160	or my had a difference in my group band sorry i haven't been following my rock
2489160	2492760	bands very well no maybe i'm gonna get yelled at by chat i think it was i think
2492760	2495480	chris cornell had a different band but i think it was somebody else that was in
2495480	2498680	sound garden i want to say all right well if you get
2498680	2501480	velvet revolver it's uh she builds quick machines
2501480	2505080	slither and messages are the bands that you will or the songs you will get in
2505080	2509720	the velvet revolver pack the um packs are 500 microsoft points
2509720	2512280	which you will remember was a bit controversial because that's how much
2512280	2515560	they charge for the old packs but now when you consider these games
2515560	2519240	haven't been in the game before and they are actually downloadable songs
2519240	2521480	you're not you're not unlocking shit that's already on the disc
2521480	2524920	velvet revolver is members of guns and roses oh shit
2524920	2529320	and uh scott wayland who the oh okay i had i had it the other way around or
2529320	2531480	something what the hell am i thinking of they had
2531480	2536280	the guy from sound garden chris cornell audio slave that was damn it
2536280	2540520	because i was like yeah he has a different band although
2540520	2544600	anyway sorry my bad
2544920	2547960	look i listen to pop music all right it's gonna mention one thing real quick
2547960	2551160	unless it's dragon force or journey since the story didn't make it into the
2551160	2554440	um show role sure it was too late uh the we
2554440	2558280	guitar hero 3 it only outputs in mono go
2558280	2562280	monophonic sound go nintendo ouch actually it's probably
2562280	2567320	activation yay mono
2567960	2570280	well
2570760	2574920	well there is something for anyone who is uh looking forward to playing guitar
2574920	2581160	hero 3 on the pc is the 360s wireless um les paul controller will work
2581160	2587400	on the pc it's not officially supported but it will work you just need the xbox
2587400	2594360	360 wireless gaming receiver um however um the pc version is
2594360	2598120	not uh it actually already comes out with a guitar
2598120	2604760	with the gibson explorer um but i guess if you want to do two player
2604760	2607000	here you go well that makes sense i mean considering
2607000	2611320	that you know they're just controllers and i could see
2611320	2615320	why they wouldn't of course add the um wireless gaming
2615320	2618120	receiver with it you know might as well do the wired version
2618120	2624440	so well the other thing though um i i actually um when we were at best
2624440	2627160	buy i think it was we actually saw a two guitar pack
2627160	2633320	for um guitar hero 3 yeah and i think that it would be pointless for them to
2633320	2636760	not release the same kind of pack for pc as well
2636760	2642520	i mean really there's so many like usb guitars out there now with you know
2642520	2646280	guitar hero just find one that you want and then buy it
2646280	2649000	well the explorer controller was kind of ugly
2649000	2652440	plus they figure you know that you you're buying all these games your
2652440	2654680	friends probably own some of the games you're gonna play two player if your
2654680	2657320	friend you come over have them bring their own guitar
2657320	2662280	i would like for you to spend more vyog
2662680	2666280	i'm sorry the les paul is a lot more hot um well
2666280	2669560	this is kind of going back a couple months but uh people might remember that
2669560	2672680	there were some issues with the wide screen in um
2672680	2678200	the xbox 360 version of bioshock well 2k is going to be fixing these
2678200	2681560	problems very soon with the next update that's going to be coming out so
2681560	2685720	all you people can stop bitching about it although i think a lot of people have
2685720	2689080	stopped bitching about it and moved on to other games like halo 3 and
2689080	2692120	games are possibly coming out next week so
2692120	2695880	i don't know but bioshock is still a great game oh yeah it's an awesome game
2695880	2697640	yeah highly recommend playing through it at
2697640	2701080	least once the only reason people will probably be opting for halo 3 instead is
2701080	2703960	because the multiplayer that's the one thing bioshock unfortunately was missing
2703960	2706920	it needed it could have used some multiplayer that would have been pretty
2706920	2709560	cool bioshock 2 you have to have something for
2709560	2713320	bioshock 2 right yeah well speaking of halo 3 which a lot of
2713320	2716680	people are turning to you might remember a few weeks ago we
2716680	2718760	talked about actually it's probably about a couple months ago at this point
2718760	2722200	we talked about the guy who uh sent the marriage proposal in viva pinata
2722200	2725160	and i'm sure we've had i think there was the story of the marriage proposal in
2725160	2728520	world of warcraft well now we have a story tonight about
2728520	2733080	a halo 3 marriage proposal yes it was somebody using the forge uh
2733080	2737400	the map editor inside halo 3 to lay down guns and swords
2737400	2742920	in the shape of the words marry me question mark
2742920	2747640	very cute what was the answer i'm assuming it was yes but we don't know
2747640	2753000	all we really know is the screenshot the answer was boom headshot
2753000	2756200	yes she said yes and then promptly shot him in the head and then
2756200	2761800	proceeded to hump his corpse the end which might be like the honeymoon who
2761800	2765720	knows uh anyway la la la la la la la la la
2765720	2770920	the xbox user was movie sign and he was proposing to his longtime girlfriend
2770920	2774520	for it furtive penguin
2775000	2779960	i love xbox live names i don't know why it came up the other night but somebody
2779960	2783320	was suggesting i changed my xbox live tag to sergeant sausage and i actually
2783320	2787560	kind of like that name that's cool you should totally do that
2787560	2792360	if it's getting taken yeah if nobody the news for the next step though is they
2792360	2797320	need to do a custom game no time limit and then have the actual
2797320	2800600	wedding procession in game there you go hey you can get
2800600	2805720	married in ragnarok so if you're a real halo 3 fan that's
2805720	2810280	what you're going to do right i guess i i don't know you know if
2810280	2815560	you're a real halo 3 fan you're gonna play halo 3 i guess i know you're not
2815560	2817720	you're not going to go out and do anything else just gonna play halo all
2817720	2819880	day well speaking of which there is some
2819880	2826040	download content that uh bungee has uh given us some information on
2826040	2831240	well not us directly but they've just given it you know they give it up
2831240	2835160	anyway um there are some uh maps that are going to be coming to the xbox live
2835160	2839400	marketplace uh one of them is the ok corral
2839400	2845800	which um is described as an asymmetrical medium-sized map so
2845800	2850120	it's got so you can fight at high noon at the ork corral
2850120	2853400	i guess so a little silly in your armor whatever
2853400	2858280	and then there's a one called a purple rain spelled r-e-i-g-n
2858280	2865240	and joe drallbank and then vandalay which is a simple map
2865240	2871000	so anyway anyway you know what um when you say that map is
2871000	2874920	called purple rain you know what that makes me think of
2879640	2884680	yeah i think that was not a good movie no matter what anyone says
2884680	2888040	prince is still awesome even if he's gone like crazy in the past five years
2888040	2893000	now he's like suing his fans but how wait wait wait wait what he's
2893000	2895720	like suing these websites that use pictures
2895720	2898280	of him it's like his fan websites but they use pictures of him
2898280	2902440	and like tattoos of of him and his symbols and stuff
2902440	2905800	because he owns them but they're like fan sites why would you bite the hand
2905800	2908200	that feeds you because you're crazy yeah because he's
2908200	2911400	crazy but still he wrote purple rain and come on tell me
2911400	2915800	you do not want to play halo with this as a custom soundtrack
2915800	2923800	everybody purple rain no do not want
2923800	2928040	i actually do like that failed uh let's see well what you might be able
2928040	2934360	to be doing um pretty soon is chocolate rain
2934360	2939880	h master osha says i guess better than chocolate rain have you heard the song
2939880	2943160	i don't want to hear that yeah i've heard chocolate rain i actually saw the
2943160	2946600	live performance of chocolate rain yeah i don't care there's a guy at my
2946600	2949320	work that he was telling everybody about it and he started singing it in his
2949320	2952680	cubicle and i thought it was the most hilarious freaking thing i'd ever heard
2952680	2956440	and then that's how i heard about it act deaf says vampire rain
2956440	2961560	no okay anyways the rain no what one game that has something that rains from
2961560	2964040	the sky that's pretty cool which would be fire
2964040	2968520	is boom boom rocket and yes they're adding a bunch of support for dance pads
2968520	2971240	and guitars so you can actually play the game with
2971240	2973960	those as well um other things that they're going to be
2973960	2977400	fixing as well adding some japanese and korean language support
2977400	2982200	uh tweaking the scoring system a little bit to focus only on accuracy
2982200	2985880	and i guess there's a huge loud noise which
2985880	2989640	popped up occasionally on endurance that they've fixed
2989640	2995240	um some other fun things they uh have another problem with display
2995240	2999400	updates when viewing through a vga cable
2999400	3003400	um they've added some stuff the friends leaderboard now shows extra information
3003400	3008360	such as grade and accuracy etc um multiplayer endurance mode
3008360	3012360	fix for players color swapping sporadically
3012360	3016440	and slightly bigger and better explosions
3016440	3021000	you gotta love an update that adds bigger explosions
3025400	3028440	oh tell me it's gonna have a chorus in here
3028440	3032520	all i can find was a bad karaoke version of this song
3034440	3039320	ah i was trying to do blame it on the rain this this sucks
3039320	3043400	i ruined the show i'm sorry they didn't have the original milli vanilli version
3043400	3045480	though on itunes go figure why wouldn't they sell that
3045480	3049880	that's a classic i'm i see how they have a karaoke version i know they have a
3049880	3053160	karaoke version which sucks obviously because nobody knew what the hell i was
3053160	3055720	trying to play joke i don't know what you're doing
3055720	3061000	you live radio oh my god marissa's in the chat room
3061000	3066760	hi marissa ah i'm so happy let's move on when was the last time
3066760	3070600	she was on the show most people was on the show a long time
3070600	3073240	ago need to come back tell us some more of
3073240	3076280	your stories marissa come back on the show okay and
3076280	3080920	then do the russian lady uh bra story uh
3080920	3084280	loki have you tried boom boom rocket with a guitar yet nope i might i just
3084280	3086200	might have to try that that sounds like fun
3086200	3089640	i saw the youtube edge though of the developers playing it pretty funny
3089640	3093320	good times ddr might be interesting but i can only play that game if it was like
3093320	3096840	actually set up like ddr how about ddr and the guitar at the same time
3096840	3102440	omg name uh if you have not yet checked out two
3102440	3106600	worlds because the very mixed reviews on it well there's now a demo available on
3106600	3109960	the xbox live marketplace so you can check that out it's a demo of
3109960	3112760	two worlds of course this is a game that's supposed to kind of
3112760	3115640	cater to the fans of oblivion but it's supposed to be you know bigger better
3115640	3119080	and better and it has multiplayer well their problem was saying it's the most
3119080	3123560	ultimate like best rpg ever you know that that was a
3123560	3126040	problem they shouldn't have marketed as the best
3126040	3130120	game ever but unfortunately the game had some flaws but fear not
3130120	3134120	uh south peak has said that they are currently making a patch
3134120	3137080	and supposed to be out very soon for two worlds and it's going to address more
3137080	3140760	than 50 different bugs and other issues in the game so
3140760	3144280	awesome i'm glad that you released the game with 50 plus bugs in it
3144280	3148520	way to go south peak shit what is wrong with these people
3148520	3153240	oh look we found 50 bugs later on you know i could understand if we found
3153240	3158360	two bugs or something like that but 50 come on that's just lazy
3158600	3162600	good times not buggy enough we don't want it oh but don't worry
3162600	3165640	the i'm sure the playstation 3 version will be coming out soon
3165640	3170360	oh talk about bugs there well anyway how about something that's a little bit more
3170360	3173320	cool for uh people with the ipod who want ipod
3173320	3179240	games harmonix is giving us phase which is um pretty much a very low
3179240	3185480	graphical given it's a ipod um version sort of of uh i guess it
3185480	3190360	plays sort of like guitar hero is supposed to but it's
3190360	3194680	tutor frequency yeah it's this they all are like the same freaking
3194680	3198120	sort of game essentially in terms of their gameplay
3198120	3203320	um but it's you your songs will interface with
3203320	3205640	the stuff so i'm probably going to download it yeah that's cool because
3205640	3209400	you can use your own songs with it on my iphone it's kind of fun can you play the
3209400	3213480	games on your iphone i'm sure i can cool i thought you would need the wheel
3213480	3215720	though to play but i guess yeah because you have the touch screen
3215720	3218920	it might still work you i think you do need the wheel for that oh
3218920	3222120	then crap give me some iphone games people
3222120	3225560	i can play it on mine i haven't well i still have an ipod and dark tetsuya
3225560	3229640	says you could play a dragon force on it heck yeah actually yeah the the phase
3229640	3232520	kind of looks like frequency and amplitude and all that stuff but it has
3232520	3235640	some zigzag stuff like it looks like you can drag back and forth
3235640	3239080	which i imagine you know using the dial um you could do
3239080	3241960	but that kind of came out of nowhere didn't it nobody knew this game was
3241960	3244840	coming but kind of interesting because nobody's
3244840	3248520	ever really taking ipod gaming that seriously because most of them have just
3248520	3252440	been ports of like cell phone games but this is kind of a big step i think
3252440	3255400	between this and some of the other recent releases they have been on the
3255400	3259480	i like the stepped up music quiz games like 99 cents and some of the other
3259480	3265240	stuff that's really taken off ipod might be a uh legitimate gaming platform
3265240	3269480	we need i'm sorry i'm sorry what'd you just say
3269480	3274520	ipod legitimate game platform we need we need iphone games
3274520	3278600	official ones i do agree that they do need is not official
3278600	3281240	true i don't want to brick my phone i mean because if you paid a couple
3281240	3284440	hundred dollars for a fucking phone you better have something that plays games
3284440	3287480	on it seriously but i do have the youtube
3287480	3291560	channel and the youtube channel makes everything better
3291560	3295000	give me a youtube channel and we that'd be cool anyways
3295000	3299320	um so something that's kind of sad i guess for some people in the media
3299320	3303480	would be that uh the npd group is going to be withholding their hardware sales
3303480	3307880	numbers stuff from the media and so they won't know exactly what
3307880	3313320	consoles are selling and stuff like that so sad oh wait
3313320	3317480	that won't affect me at all so are you going to continue to report the numbers
3317480	3322840	to us here on the show like yeah i will awesome so yeah so sad
3322840	3325880	but no not that it really matters anyways because it's fucking console
3325880	3329160	sale numbers i mean they'll have some stupid press release
3329160	3332120	that each company will release you because you know sony nintendo and
3332120	3335000	microsoft are not going to shut up about it and obviously they're going to you
3335000	3338760	know release what their console sold so it's
3338760	3343000	not like you know you're so left out about it but
3343000	3346920	i'll be happy to report them all right well some numbers that maybe we can be
3346920	3349160	reporting on soon are these new games that are

3590760	3594120	orange box and they probably just listen to separate as well
3594120	3597240	well i think no i think that they actually are getting separate sales and

3948920	3955080	um whatever you know impossible mission on the ds we'll end it
3955080	3957640	right there all right oh impossible sure impossible
3957640	3961320	mission seriously impossible mission dude that kid was the shit to be honest i
3961320	3966920	don't think it's coming out on the ds lies it is coming out soon though on the
3966920	3969480	we and ds well one thing that will not be coming
3969480	3972760	to your local target is manhunt 2 you might remember last week we were talking
3972760	3976920	about the uh rumors about the ban going on for target 2 because of the uh
3976920	3979880	hack remember we talked about that last week well a
3979880	3983720	official word has been put out from target about the official ban yes it is
3983720	3986120	true target will not be carrying manhunt 2
3986120	3989960	quote target strives to provide merchandise that will appeal to a wide
3989960	3992440	variety of guests we also want guests to be comfortable
3992440	3994520	with the purchasing decisions they make at target
3994520	3997720	all video games and computer software sold at target currently carry ratings
3997720	4000600	by the esrb from early childhood through mature
4000600	4004360	audiences while manhunt 2 was given a mature rating by the esrb
4004360	4007400	we received additional information that players can potentially view
4007400	4011400	previously filtered content by altering the game code as a result we've decided
4011400	4015720	not to carry the game because i'm sure the millions of people
4015720	4018600	that shop at target know how to do this to hack their psp to
4018600	4022440	unlock all the content i don't know about you guys i think
4022440	4026280	it's a little silly but i guess it's their choice people get
4026280	4029720	at other places apparently target doesn't like money
4029720	4032920	i guess not although then again how many people i mean is manhunt 2 really going
4032920	4034760	to be that big a big seller it's it's more
4034760	4037800	it's one of those games that's kind of all talk you know what i mean it is all
4037800	4041640	talk well still this and this news about a
4041640	4044680	manhunt 2 makes me very angry i don't know about you guys but i get very
4044680	4047320	angsty when i hear about this kind of censorship
4047320	4051720	and that means we need to do the fus of the week
4051720	4055720	so
4060360	4066120	jamie do you have any fus you'd like to share with us f you to mr annoying
4066120	4071800	my coworker sorry to hear it when i go to work i do not want to hear the word of
4071800	4074120	god
4074360	4079080	i don't want to hear oh my productivity sucks then so you get up from your desk
4079080	4085880	50 000 times a day and not do your crap i'm tired of you bitching like a
4085880	4091240	menopausal woman just shut up
4091240	4094440	but thank you for helping me with my work loki
4094440	4098760	uh if you did not having more time during the day to play games
4098760	4103480	that's all i got my fu goes to work drama although i don't think things have
4103480	4106280	been going that bad i actually you know i still love my job and what i do
4106280	4110360	daytime but there was a little bit of drama this past week but it's nothing
4110360	4113880	won't get past it's just you know getting through it is a little bit of a
4113880	4118920	nephew that's all if you do drama in general
4118920	4124520	don't want no drama do not want moving on with this week's gaming news
4124520	4128120	then well for uh people who've been keeping
4128120	4131880	up with the news on the max pain movie 20th century fox
4131880	4135960	has asked mark walberg to be in it and he said okay
4135960	4139160	at least that's what we're hearing so far
4139160	4144760	so um i think it would be cool with him in it i mean he's a good actor
4144760	4149000	better than his rap career he was pretty good in the party as an angry cop and
4149000	4151880	he's also good in the wee on the night as an angry cop so
4151880	4157240	he was great in this movie and in this movie where he plays an angry cop it
4157240	4160840	should work so yeah i think he's got the angry cop
4160840	4166040	roll down anyways um akira yamoko is actually working on a
4166040	4169400	brand new game series of course it's untitled yet
4169400	4172600	but uh glad to know that he's moving beyond
4172600	4176680	um silent hill at least i think he's moving on
4176680	4180760	beyond silent hill could be silent hill the musical maybe
4180760	4185240	that'd be awesome no but uh no idea what kind of game it is
4185240	4189720	what platform it is but he says that should be announced soon
4189720	4194600	so it's coming soon but if it's coming from akira yamoko like seriously how
4194600	4199720	can it be bad if you can't really be bad but yeah
4199720	4203960	i don't know i kind of feel left out with uh konami right now
4203960	4207640	you know no summer event that they did because they were moving offices and
4207640	4212280	stuff makes me sad all right
4212280	4216040	well we're just about to the end of our part a tonight
4216040	4219640	the first half of tonight's program we always like to close part a by
4219640	4222200	respecting our elders a little bit the way we do that
4222200	4226200	is by acknowledging the classic game of the week as selected by our the one and
4226200	4230200	only dark sakura so dark sakura is going to
4230200	4233480	dig through the archives and find a game that she thinks
4233480	4238120	you guys need to check out it's the classic game of the week
4238120	4241400	dark soccer what is this week's pick for the classic game of the week
4241400	4244360	i've brought this game up several times and it's just about damn time i said
4244360	4247320	something about it um today's game of the week is blazing
4247320	4252120	star for the neo geo very cool and we actually will play some
4252120	4257160	clips from blazing star i'm trying to get into some actual gameplay here
4260920	4264760	and the intro is all um you know rendered pretty and everything but the
4264760	4269560	game itself is um it's for the most part 2d with some
4269560	4274120	cg so it's pretty pretty sweet and um it's
4274120	4278440	basically like i think side schooling shooter um it's actually fairly
4278440	4283240	uh it's the sequel to polestar and polestar was a good game but blazing
4283240	4287400	star is just really really good and um it's actually
4287400	4293080	related to our type in its family but not quite you know what was that
4293080	4296120	fetus looking thing it turned into a star or something that
4296120	4301640	was weird it's weirdo storyline imagine star baby
4301640	4308600	i guess so anyway um it has a lot of you know uh
4308600	4313320	cut scenes and you know as you can hear a lot of talk wow this is like fun
4313320	4318040	oh my god this game is terrific log i'm gonna put this on a virtual console i
4318040	4320600	hope so i've never played it better well you know
4320600	4324600	what where i um i had actually played this um quite a bit when i lived in
4324600	4328760	alabama and i was very sad because the machine that i played it on was
4328760	4333240	actually broken into and the uh cartridge stolen out of it ouch it was
4333240	4338920	one of those multi avs machines um but anyway um
4338920	4342680	crust view lanes in sacramento they have this
4342680	4346920	they had it ah and they closed they closed down their arcade to put in the
4346920	4351800	pro shop dang but this is the boss coming yep
4351800	4355400	what is the boss here sure we're gonna listen to some music
4355400	4360920	boss music oh it's like a spider mech thing gross
4363320	4366440	oh you're you're timed on the bosses i noticed yeah you are turned on the
4366440	4368840	bosses and if you don't beat them within the
4368840	4371720	time limit you still progress but you don't get the points for beating the
4371720	4376040	boss huh that's kind of different very cool
4376040	4379720	and if i'm right i think it takes life wow
4379720	4384280	you beat it your skill is great that's the congratulatory you also um
4384280	4387720	collect um letters as you go through and it gives you more um
4387720	4391000	power ups and bonuses as you go through the game awesome um
4391000	4397000	but it is basically you have um a fire button and you have a bomb button
4397000	4403320	and you have charged attacks so it's very very very very cool
4403320	4407320	good times and people complain that blazing star was sort of you know dumb
4407320	4412120	down for its difficulty from pole star i disagree blazing star is still pretty
4412120	4415720	damn hard once you get past the first few stages
4415720	4420920	but it's just really i think that my favorite ship to play in
4420920	4425800	that game is the green one all right i don't know the graphics in
4425800	4428760	this game for some reason i don't know why it reminds me a little bit of un
4428760	4433160	squadron just this art style for some reason i don't know what it is a
4433160	4435640	little bit but um on top of that it was actually one
4435640	4440520	of the larger neo geo roms oh wow it was a 346 megabyte one because
4440520	4443000	of all the where did all that go well um it was
4443000	4447320	mostly um for the uh the pre-rendered uh 3d and there are
4447320	4452840	sprites that they were pre-rendered all right very cool blazing star is your
4452840	4457880	classic video game of the week of the neo geo game is freaking awesome
4457880	4461720	all right well that's going to bring us to a close here for part a of our
4461720	4465560	podcast but fear not because we tape uh for several hours
