13973	18635	Tonight, November 11th, 2007, Manhunt 2 disappears from Target.
19016	21797	New patch lets you play Boom Boom Rocket with your guitar.
22217	25539	And can your PlayStation 3 warranty be voided by dust?
32250	33571	Hi everybody out there on the internet.
33651	36413	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36453	42818	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43198	44419	My name is Rob Roberts.
44779	47801	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura.
48041	48302	Hi.
48622	49462	How are you doing, DarkSakura?
50103	51364	I've been fed now.
51864	52625	I'm feeling a lot better.
52785	56568	You're full of burrito from one of our local joints, Aldebertos.
56688	58469	I'm not really supposed to be eating that.
58489	59189	Is this horchata?
59530	60330	No, it's Diet Coke.
60350	61391	I love horchata.
62185	67289	I love horchata too, however, because this is pretty much the only other thing I've eaten today.
67309	68810	I figured a burrito wouldn't kill me.
69150	71993	Horchatas probably are not very good for you because they taste like liquid churros.
72313	73794	Oh my God, they're so good though.
75235	78798	For anyone who doesn't know what an horchata is, it's a sweet rice drink.
79358	79979	It's delicious.
80059	81000	It tastes like a churro.
81240	82321	It's got cinnamon in it.
82381	83121	It's really delicious.
83161	83662	Good times.
84342	89046	But the only other thing I had today was a low carb tortilla with peanut butter on it.
90006	91327	And I wasn't hungry after that.
91388	91808	I was like...
92358	93459	Wow, I'm so not hungry.
93479	94600	Because peanut butter is awesome.
94700	96982	And then I started getting hungry, like, right before I had to leave the house.
97442	101005	So I was like... And then I started getting sleepy, too, so I was... Caffeine and food.
101306	103027	Here we go, turning into the food cast again.
103067	106390	Why is it at the beginning of every episode of Orange Lounge Radio we're like the food cast?
106410	108752	Because I always bring in my dinner and you have to comment on it.
110553	112255	I'm just... Well, I'm jealous because I'm hungry.
112735	115878	I haven't really eaten, so... I ate a little bit, but...
116573	117513	I have Belgian chocolate too.
117553	119014	I'm going to make you some spaghetti, Rob.
119594	120355	Do you have spaghetti?
120375	120995	Spaghetti.
121495	121755	All right.
122575	125937	Joining us as well, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.
126217	126437	Hello.
126497	127858	How are you doing, Loki?
128078	128498	Doing good.
129058	129378	Awesome.
130239	131739	What have you been playing over there on the PSP?
131759	138842	I was yelling at Loki just before the show to turn it down because I couldn't hear the regular stuff because I was being distracted by the PSP.
138862	139843	What are you playing on the PSP?
139963	140923	Silent Hill Origins.
141243	141583	Nice.
141783	142203	Good times?
142243	142624	Is it fun?
142744	143424	Yeah, it's pretty good.
143985	144265	Awesome.
144525	149447	Well, I'm sure we will hear more about that during the How Is Your Gaming Week, which is our first segment we always get into.
149507	151108	Unfortunately, no guests in the studio tonight.
151168	151988	It's just the three of us.
152308	154549	But that's okay because we always have our fourth guest.
155349	156170	No, we love the guests.
156550	158090	But many of them are having birthdays this week.
158130	159331	I'll get to that in just a little bit.
160191	162152	For now, I want to introduce the ever-present.
163061	164042	Other guests on our program.
164082	165322	It's all of you in our chat room.
165402	170085	Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com for those of you guys that join us live when we tape on Sunday nights.
170445	172306	I understand there's some new folks in chat tonight.
173047	178870	Joel Neer said he or she was new when they joined, so welcome, newbie.
179270	182972	And I'm not sure if we have any other newbies, but welcome to all the newbies in chat.
183012	183913	We like new people.
184513	185894	All right, let's start off with how was your gaming week?
186334	187335	Oh, wait, oh.
187725	190567	DarkSakura's mouth is full of burrito and is unable to... I don't talk with my mouth full.
190927	191407	That's good.
191648	192448	I'm glad you have manners.
193069	196010	Like a certain co-worker of mine does... Oh my god.
196091	197211	Okay, that's getting to FUs.
197852	201774	This week, I was playing Cooking Mama.
203255	204676	I'm playing Eating Mama.
205837	206197	Anyway.
207598	209940	My gaming week, I actually did something other than Ragnarok.
211281	213022	Okay, I had to play a shitload of Ragnarok, but still.
214262	216204	I got a level from...
217162	223464	Zero, of course being uber noob, to I think 82 in three days.
223744	224064	Nerd.
225064	225444	Doesn't matter.
226765	232566	So anyway, I also played slash watched, I played a little watched a lot of Portal.
233406	239488	Finally, and I've seen the ending, it's fucked up, and I love it.
239708	243549	So Dan's gonna rent it for me from his store, because
244056	247438	Good thing about being a manager at GameCrazy is that he can get me free rentals at Hollywood Video.
248358	249919	So he's just going to bring me home portal one day.
250199	252980	And he said he was going to laugh at me when I got really motion sick.
253061	255122	I was like, uh-uh, I'm going to stop every two levels.
256702	257383	Take a little breather.
257403	259324	Of course, it's like such a quick game.
259464	261725	It's like, wow, this is three hours of...
262950	263831	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
290885	292326	The Cake is a Lie
317768	321370	Well, otherwise you have to get one that's too big and looks all dumpy.
322011	324072	But my friend, though, has the best t-shirt ever.
324092	325273	I have to share this with everybody.
325713	330356	She has a shirt with two 20-sided dye on it set to 20 and says, yes, they're natural.
332598	334179	Nice.
334539	336701	I went to see my friend Becky yesterday.
336721	343285	This is where I watched a whole bunch of Portal as we went over to a party that had cheesecake.
343886	346007	So I was going around all day saying the cheesecake was a lie.
347044	349366	I'm surprised no one's had a portal party yet.
350366	355969	What they need to do is record the little music that's playing on the radio in there and just blast it on little radios.
356390	361192	A portal party, yay!
361232	365335	You could actually probably easily make one of the... That's what I'm going to do for my next cosplay.
367793	375679	Don't you think that cosplay for portal characters and stuff is going to be really popular, though?
376179	378761	I'm just going to carry one of those eyeball things around.
380643	382324	Or a weighted companion cube.
383745	386667	Everybody, you're invited to our portal party.
387508	389129	Dress up like your favorite character.
389149	390150	It'll be fun.
390670	392471	Let all two of them, or three.
393052	396134	And the only time you actually see your character is you happen to be looking through another portal.
397608	398829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
419369	421289	platforms on top to the other side.
421669	425410	And so you have to jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, and then shoot the other portal and go through it so that you got enough momentum.
425930	427631	And I got so freaking sick.
427791	429211	I had to leave the room, but that was about it.
429231	433051	You should try to get the achievement for the 30,000 foot drop or whatever.
433452	434332	That'll make you sick.
435632	436892	You have to drop for six minutes.
436992	442513	This was on a laptop, so the resolution was so high that it really, really bugged me.
444174	444894	But it was very good.
445814	446794	So anything else for your gaming week?
447708	449510	I played World Cup Soccer in 1994.
450150	450490	Pinball?
450891	451571	Goal!
451711	452152	Good times.
452772	453753	Loki, how was your gaming week?
454454	457236	My gaming week was pretty full, actually.
458317	460799	Okay, so I did play Portal as well.
460879	461840	I finished as well.
461920	464782	I also finished all the advanced levels, so that was fun.
466584	470167	I like the little ball you get in one of those, too, that you have to carry it around.
470427	475011	It's a level where you have the companion cube, but when you're playing it on advanced, it's like a little ball that bounces.
476031	476672	So, you know,
477170	477990	Rolls around stuff.
478170	478731	Not real fun.
481032	483753	I do have to add that I love the automated weapons.
485873	486173	Oh, yeah.
486594	487054	What they say.
487634	488314	Yeah, they're cute.
489135	489355	Sorry.
489555	491055	Should have a trash can that does that.
491075	491616	That'd be cool.
492336	492676	Anyways.
492996	497618	Ooh, they should make an automated one like that that shoots like, um... What was it?
497658	499919	Those soft pellet things?
500439	500959	Yeah.
500979	501239	Airsoft.
501259	501859	That would be great.
502200	502580	Or Nerf.
503740	504120	Yeah.
504560	504981	Okay, anyways.
505721	505821	Um...
506587	507067	Let's see.
507268	508349	Other things I played.
509169	510270	Super Mario Galaxy.
512072	514274	Just flat out the best game for the Wii.
515234	516455	I mean, that's it.
516816	518317	It's the best Mario game I've played.
518417	521099	It feels very, very, very much like Mario 64.
521800	522681	Control's awesome.
522761	523601	Looks awesome.
524202	525723	You gotta buy it if you own a Wii.
526784	529186	If you don't own a Wii, you gotta buy a Wii so you can buy the game.
531408	535071	Then I played... What else did I play here?
535623	536443	Of course, Scenes Pro.
537023	537684	Play lots of that.
539844	542265	Silent Hill Origins, started that a little bit.
542465	544226	Looks very, very good on PSP.
544466	545286	Very surprised.
545667	548748	The smoke and fog looks amazing.
549348	550248	But it's going to be a great game.
550428	554270	A lot of the reviews have said people like this out of the entire series.
554550	555370	Probably the best game.
556991	560912	Another game I've played that a lot of people are dying to get their hands on is Assassin's Creed.
561618	562579	Ghost Squad on the Wii.
590939	594082	Probably the weirdest, dumbest shooter ever, but you gotta buy it.
594202	596724	It's gonna be like 30 bucks, comes out in a couple weeks.
596784	601108	I'm playing the Japanese version, which is all in English anyways, but it is fun.
601188	608415	We've beat the game like three times today, and as you beat the game, you get like experience points, and you unlock new weapons that make the game harder.
608595	609716	What exactly do you do in this game?
610017	611057	It's just like Time Crisis.
611338	612719	It's just, you know, shooting stuff.
613565	623958	Um, and, I mean, it's just so cheesy and stupid, though, but as you finish the game, you also unlock different levels, um, or the levels get harder, and they have different things that they add in there.
624378	631126	Works very well with the Wii Remote, um, great gun game, highly recommend it, I mean, especially if you're not looking to spend, like, you know,
632220	635622	50 bucks on Resident Evil, Ghost Squad, definitely a good one to pick up.
636382	646146	It also does support the Wii Zapper, although I don't have a Wii Zapper, and as far as I can tell, it only uses the remotes, so I don't know why the hell you would use a Wii Zapper with this anyways.
646847	647967	But you can, I guess.
649128	651609	And then the last game I played, which is
653052	653952	Really crappy.
654353	656654	It's a game called Counterforce on the Wii.
656954	659435	You might not have heard of it, and that's probably a good thing.
659915	665077	It's people compared to, I guess, Star Fox, but it's no way near Star Fox.
665818	669199	It is just a pile of shit, and you shouldn't play it.
669499	671960	And I feel sorry for all the customers I sold that to.
672000	672801	Is it shit force?
673361	674902	It's just, it's crap.
675482	675962	Crap force.
677383	678003	Why is it crap?
678837	679717	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
699881	702563	and it says Counter Force and it has the company that made it.
702663	709729	Well, there's this period out in the middle of nowhere because they didn't format it right and so the period's kind of moved over to the next line or something.
710169	715913	It's just, it's really cheap looking and it is a cheap game so, I don't know.
716254	726722	From the makers of such wonderful games as Ninja Bread Man, Anubis 2 and Billy the Wizard, Rocket Boomstick Racing.
726862	729644	No, we are not ripping off of Harry Potter even though we are.
730387	732068	Ghost Squad is great, though.
760057	760397	DarkSakura.com
778604	781366	Suddenly the chat room has turned to talk about Ninja Bread Man.
781386	784487	We have Gerardimo in chat says, Ninja Bread Man, FTW.
785088	788129	Odd1 says, I gotta love those guys just for the name Ninja Bread Man.
788509	791491	And Actdeft dissents and says, Ninja Bread Man looks crappy.
794793	795293	There you have it.
796154	797134	Anything else you played this week?
799736	802937	Actually, I did play one thing, but I don't really have much of an impression for it.
803438	804218	Forever Blue.
804859	805219	It's a...
806420	809020	underwater, I guess, scuba diving sim for the Wii.
809200	809781	It looks pretty.
810741	812421	I guess it's sort of like Pokemon Snap.
812541	819642	Unfortunately, the version I played was all in Japanese, and I'm trying to get my hands on an English copy, so I can actually understand what's going on.
819802	823803	But you can play your own MP3s on it, like Excite Truck, so that's kind of cool.
824203	833145	Except the MP3s I had in my card at the time were from Excite Truck, so it didn't really fit the underwater Enya that they have normal playing in the game.
833825	835065	Instead, I have some, like,
836097	840078	Rock and Roll stuff, you know, like Paranoia something.
841318	841658	I don't know.
842979	843339	It was fun.
843639	843879	Nice.
845079	845359	Let's see.
845379	847099	So my gaming week then, if you're all finished.
847179	847440	I'm done.
848060	848340	Let's see.
848400	849300	What did I play this week?
849340	850900	I played a little bit of World of Warcraft.
851300	853921	Also kind of got sucked back into Final Fantasy XI a little bit.
853961	854541	I've been leveling.
855781	856081	Hi.
856922	857502	Hi, Jamie.
857522	858502	Is there anything you want to say to that?
858542	858722	Hi, Rob.
859332	861032	No, I already gave you hell for it the other day.
888439	889320	That noise.
889560	890981	I am going to play this game how I want.
891021	897166	So therefore, I am going to be a Corsair bard because I like to buff people and both those classes are all about buffing people.
897506	902230	Corsairs are awesome because they're based around gambling and bards are awesome because they sing.
902330	906934	Basically, my character is a tacky Las Vegas nightclub act because I gamble and I sing.
907314	907755	It's awesome.
908675	912078	If I played that again, I would totally play a white mage monk.
913119	913599	Good times.
913920	916322	See, we should just have a party of people playing whatever the hell they want.
916342	918063	But that makes sense though, a white mage and a monk.
921035	928263	DarkTetsuya says Rob likes to buff people very funny, jerk what are you laughing at?
928923	930405	you have an aim chatter with a comment?
930565	931626	I couldn't read it, what's it say?
931846	934229	Rob likes to buff people shut up let's see
937826	938606	I've been playing a lot of that.
938626	944249	I actually took Corsair from level 10 to level 17 in just a matter of days, so that should tell you about how much I was playing.
944669	948951	I also was playing on the Nintendo Wii a little bit, because I was looking for the Check Me Out channel.
949911	952052	It wasn't there yet, but I did download Super Mario Bros.
952452	955333	3, and I was playing a little bit of that, because that is a classic game.
955633	957994	But I'll tell you what, when you play Super Mario Bros.
958354	962516	3, if you're playing on a widescreen TV and you have it scrunched in...
963424	964505	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
982520	983141	Super Mario Bros. 3
1004119	1005921	The authentic Super Mario Bros.
1006081	1006662	experience.
1007382	1010845	Joel Neer in chat is asking, what about the new dancer job of Final Fantasy XI?
1010885	1012307	I am excited for the new jobs.
1012367	1013668	I think Scholar and Dancer look good.
1013768	1014949	I hope there's a third one.
1015309	1018673	I would love to see Geomancer or something, but I hear it's not going to happen.
1018693	1019513	It's only going to be the two.
1020454	1023177	My buddy Shane, who you've probably heard on the show.
1023257	1023537	I don't know.
1023577	1024578	There's only the two.
1024658	1026199	They're going to say it's only the two jobs.
1026400	1027501	Well, Dancer and what's the other one?
1027701	1028942	Scholar is the other one.
1029298	1030238	How the fuck's Scholar?
1030258	1032159	Scholar was, like, kind of obscure.
1032219	1034300	I think Scholar was... I'm smart!
1034380	1036500	Well, that's not going to help you in fighting enemies.
1036860	1040742	Scholar is like a combination of White Mage and Black Mage, but they're not a Red Mage.
1040802	1043683	They use what's called, I think it's called Grimoire or something.
1044023	1055867	They use this to basically strengthen the White Magic and weaken the Black Magic if you use a White Scholar, or a White Grimoire, or there's the Black one that will strengthen the Black Magic and weaken the White Magic, and they have their own unique spells.
1055887	1057007	There's support for the support.
1057607	1057968	Sort of.
1057988	1059689	The rumor is they get the reflect spell.
1059809	1062311	They're going to have reflect, which is a spell that's missing from the game.
1062371	1064873	So then they're going to basically be like the...
1067059	1071664	for lack of a better description, like the ones that reflect the enemy.
1072084	1078110	Well, look, here's what it really is, is that the scholar artifact armor, which is like the endgame armor, is a school outfit.
1078390	1080833	So now you can actually be a Japanese schoolgirl in the game.
1080953	1085037	So let's just go to the reality of why we're doing this job.
1085457	1087199	Japanese schoolgirls everywhere.
1087279	1089481	So I'm guessing that we're going to see lots of...
1091840	1092961	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1115760	1117582	Enough about Final Fantasy XI.
1117682	1119404	I would say, what else have I played on?
1119525	1119825	Xbox.
1119885	1120766	I've been playing Guitar Hero.
1120806	1125892	We had people over here last night because the night started at John's Incredible Pizza, which is this chain.
1126212	1129797	I think mostly only exists in Central California, like Fresno, I think is where it started.
1130077	1131318	But now it's up here in Roseville.
1131338	1131859	They have one.
1132319	1134382	Our show is based out of Sacramento, Roseville being a suburb.
1135260	1137342	I sometimes forget we have people all around that listen.
1137782	1141845	So anyway, we're at this John's Incredible Pizza, which is basically like a Dave and Buster's for kids.
1141865	1145348	They have a big pizza buffet, and then they have this game room.
1145368	1146950	They actually have rides in the joint.
1147510	1151974	This place used to be a Sam's Club, and they totally converted it into this ginormous pizza place.
1152254	1154355	But they have video games, and we started the night playing.
1154395	1160000	I was playing DDR Supernova, and my boyfriend William is so hilarious because while I was playing, this like,
1160779	1162200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1187324	1187644	He's great.
1188225	1189826	One of these days I will let him come on the show.
1190146	1191327	Oh, that would be fantastic.
1191347	1192088	He's hilarious.
1193369	1195150	He was very funny at dinner, by the way.
1195230	1195731	He's the best.
1195771	1196151	He's the best.
1196211	1196471	Anyway.
1197112	1198994	Yeah, they're all in Central California.
1199634	1201095	I need to stop gushing so much.
1201155	1211364	Anyway, here's the other thing about John's Incredible Peach that I thought was hilarious is that pretty much outside of DDR and some random shooter games, it was all ticket games.
1211844	1214086	Like, you know, gambling for kids basically, right?
1214106	1214186	Yeah.
1214952	1215872	www.DarkSakura.com
1238025	1254006	to buy out your case or whatever like it's basically the show but with tickets I couldn't believe it I was like floored but then this place had rides in it like it had a roller coaster inside which I thought was crazy kind of a fun little place I'm sure they'll do well Gerardimo says deal or no deal is too expensive to play
1254973	1257074	Actdeft says, yay, gambling is good for you.
1257374	1259055	GS68 says, jump in jackpot.
1259315	1262636	Dude, this place had not one, but two jump in jackpot machines.
1262956	1269858	And for those in New York City that went when I was there and we had the OLR meetup, I got further in jumping jackpot than I ever have before.
1269898	1275440	I don't know if the machine was set to an easier difficulty, but I got all the way to like the O in jackpot, and then I lost.
1275480	1276161	I was so pissed.
1277121	1282983	Anyhow, jump in jackpot is that jump rope game with the random Eurobeat music that sounds like Flamin' Finger.
1283820	1284361	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1296835	1297095	Awesome.
1297115	1297956	The Cake is a Lie shirt?
1298056	1298296	Yes.
1298636	1299056	Good times.
1299517	1304119	So I was going to say, oh yes, so since they were out of beer mugs, the idea was to come back to my place and drink.
1304159	1308982	So everybody came over, those of us that went out, there's about seven of us that went out, and we came back here and we played Guitar Hero.
1309502	1310883	And everybody was learning how to play.
1310943	1315425	William played for the first time, some other people I just met were playing for the first time, we were all having a good time.
1315806	1318367	So Guitar Hero, great party game, even though I only have one guitar.
1319309	1320150	But I've been playing through that.
1320170	1326819	I finally got some achievements for getting all the five stars on Medium, and now I'm finally working on hard and expert songs, and it's hard.
1327239	1330604	You know, I could come over one day and bring one of my controllers.
1330644	1330984	You should.
1331184	1333367	We should rock out, do some co-op, be fun.
1333868	1335029	I want rock bands so much.
1335290	1336191	And I do want to say this.
1337079	1339740	That Dragonforce song is the fucking shit.
1339940	1341480	I love that song, seriously.
1341760	1343780	But here's the thing I noticed about Dragonforce.
1343820	1347201	I was so into that song, even though playing it sucks.
1347961	1354283	I was so into that song, I went and looked them up on iTunes, and seriously, all of their songs sound exactly the same.
1354343	1356843	Yeah, my friend has a CD of them.
1357323	1357884	They're awesome.
1357904	1364265	Wait, I'm going to look them up on the store real quick and play some of this for you guys.
1365114	1368537	I don't know how well it's going to run, though, because we have the webcam going, so it's kind of slow.
1369958	1373842	That's pretty much all I wanted to say about my gaming week.
1373922	1376444	Anybody else want to add anything on their gaming weeks before we move on?
1379487	1380348	No.
1380708	1383371	Okay, here's the song from Guitar Hero.
1383751	1384892	Let me see if this will actually play.
1384932	1385693	It might be too slow.
1386454	1387795	And I was trying to sync with my iPod, too.
1391723	1392063	Rock!
1393204	1406329	This should be a DDR song.
1406349	1410171	Doesn't that sound like a song from hell for Guitar Hero?
1410411	1411991	Okay, here's some of their other music.
1412052	1414453	Here's a song called Operation Ground and Pound.
1418074	1418554	It's loading.
1418614	1419074	Give it a moment.
1419615	1420135	Apparently the...
1428208	1429969	Pretty much sounds exactly the same, right?
1430049	1432311	Also would be a hellacious song to Guitar Hero.
1434752	1436153	I totally want to drive to this.
1438715	1441717	This is going to be my custom soundtrack to Burnout.
1442478	1443438	Okay, one more for you guys.
1443618	1444959	Revolution Death Squad.
1447801	1448181	Here we go.
1449262	1449803	Oh, God.
1449823	1451364	Oh, God.
1455575	1457076	They really do sound the same.
1461219	1462480	You can make ringtones out of them.
1462500	1463161	That's great.
1463241	1467824	I hear, though, that the drummer is actually drumming that.
1468825	1469845	Oh, God, that's so crazy.
1469905	1470966	Cry for Eternity.
1470986	1471266	Hold on.
1471346	1471667	One more.
1471887	1472187	One more.
1473928	1474909	This band is awesome.
1480753	1481374	That's cool.
1485370	1487211	Well, at least your drummer doesn't have to have any talent.
1487731	1488592	I mean, wait.
1490353	1492875	Can you imagine what these concerts must be like?
1494376	1496737	Like, people die in mosh pits.
1496897	1497978	Seriously.
1498578	1501820	It'd be like a Death Clock concert.
1502461	1504902	Dragon Force is like one of my new favorite bands, seriously.
1505983	1509385	However, I will tell you why Guitar Hero 3 pisses me off, as well as Rock Band.
1509425	1510866	You know why these games piss me off?
1511606	1512587	Lack of journey.
1513547	1516068	AZHP says most relaxing game ever plus Dragon Force equals wins.
1538629	1540150	That is the perfect music for it.
1540170	1543052	You should put that in your little ocean exploring game.
1547935	1549276	It should be like a Katamari game.
1550017	1550437	For real.
1551077	1555360	Carizzle says, I would be all over a Dragon Force downloadable content pack for Guitar Hero 3.
1555961	1559923	I refuse to pay the high prices, but I would just have to if they came out with a Dragon Force pack.
1560344	1561625	I bought the Foo Fighters one.
1561665	1562245	What can I say?
1562745	1563326	I like Foo Fighters.
1563346	1565107	Rob, what we need to do is we need to do a video segment.
1565706	1568468	Crappy games that are made better through Dragon Force.
1569028	1570129	I love this idea.
1570389	1571629	I love this idea.
1571769	1573090	I fully support that thought.
1573130	1575952	Crappy games made better with the music of Dragon Force.
1575992	1577253	This is a brilliant idea.
1577373	1578093	Patent pending.
1578133	1580634	Nobody better copy that shit because we're going to put it out there on the internet.
1580674	1582335	Love it.
1582355	1585837	What would be a crappy game we can make better with music from Dragon Force?
1586558	1588039	Barbie Island Princess.
1590569	1593831	Actually, I don't think that has custom soundtracks because it's not on the 360.
1594671	1598674	It doesn't matter what game, because you can turn the... Viva Piñata Party Animals.
1598734	1598974	Yes.
1599514	1600555	Because it has racing in it.
1600575	1601475	Oh, Fusion Frenzy.
1602076	1602576	Fusion Frenzy 2.
1602616	1605218	That would be game to give me back, though.
1606438	1606678	Anyway.
1607919	1613402	You know, I think that the last really awful game, because usually I wait to play a game until I'm sure I'm really going to like it.
1614923	1619806	I remember renting a game, though, one time from Blockbuster that was so bad, we went back and asked for our money back.
1620725	1623187	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1651411	1652011	I'm gonna email them.
1652672	1653132	Why not?
1653372	1653773	Why not?
1654473	1655454	Well, it doesn't hurt.
1655554	1656995	Find who their publicist is.
1657055	1658296	I'm gonna laugh fast.
1658996	1660357	Okay, chat room, chat room.
1660417	1664980	What we should try to do, and, you know, we were supposed to play Super Metroid back in the day.
1665040	1667382	I want Dragon Force to do the new theme for our show.
1668462	1669083	We should ask them.
1669103	1669683	That'd be rad.
1669923	1670304	But, Rob.
1670964	1671284	What?
1671805	1673065	We should bring over Vibraban.
1674847	1675527	Are you okay?
1675867	1676187	Don't die.
1677128	1677889	And put it on Op 11.
1677969	1678109	Okay.
1679366	1680827	The Awesomeness of Dragon Force
1693059	1697540	First off, speaking of Guitar Hero, if you're playing Guitar Hero, join the Guitar Hero OL Army.
1697800	1702101	There's more information in our LiveJournal community, on our MySpace, also on the forums.
1703241	1706382	The Guitar Hero OL Army is still in the top 100, I'm proud to say.
1706742	1709802	So thank you everybody who's joined and made it a success.
1710182	1715243	Richie Maniac is now at the top of our boards, by the way, and he has like over 2,500 groupies.
1715563	1719564	So he probably is playing Dragon Force over and over again to get that highest score, so...
1720148	1721250	Props to you, my friend.
1721450	1722191	I also have some.
1722552	1722772	Yes.
1723653	1731044	For anyone who's playing on the same server that I am for Ragnarok Online and playing on Deliverance Online, I'm making our guild tonight.
1732346	1732607	Awesome.
1732787	1735912	And so the character to look for is Cecily.
1736943	1739444	So, but don't find me because I don't really want to.
1739804	1743945	But you're going to, and how can they get to your Ragnarok server if they want to join the Ragnarok OLR?
1743965	1745625	Just look for Deliverance Online.
1746625	1748926	If you do a search for it, it's going to be the first thing that comes up on Google.
1749346	1749606	Swell.
1750026	1755767	So, but that's the, my primary character that I will be making available for the OLR me.
1755927	1757467	You will post that in the forums too, right?
1758068	1758548	Eventually.
1758928	1759128	Good.
1759908	1760288	Someday.
1761168	1761528	Soon.
1761788	1764769	Speaking of Guitar Hero, did anybody see this week's South Park?
1765442	1766303	No, I don't watch TV.
1766503	1769464	It was a parody of Guitar Hero, and it was kind of funny.
1769504	1771986	Like, it wasn't LOL funny, but it was, you know, haha.
1772546	1776208	It was like a parody of rock superstardom, but with Guitar Hero.
1776508	1783752	But I'll tell you what, the funniest part was the very end, when Stan and Kyle are finally reunited, and they are going to break a million points in Guitar Hero.
1783792	1785013	Jamie, you'll get a kick out of this.
1785613	1787614	You're going to do it!
1787634	1787914	Yeah!
1796897	1797457	They did it!
1797817	1799138	Oh my sweet Jesus!
1800018	1803900	You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach 1 million points!
1804480	1805621	Congratulations!
1806181	1813324	You are BAD!
1817165	1817546	That's it?
1819187	1823328	Now, you'd think I would be offended or something, but seriously, that shit's hilarious.
1823369	1824709	Like, I was on the ground laughing.
1824989	1829151	But the funniest part was my roommate walked in, and he hadn't seen any of the episode.
1829171	1830351	He just saw, like, the very end.
1830611	1834292	And when he saw that, and he's watched me play Guitar Hero, like, tons throughout the day.
1834332	1836233	His jaw was just, like, on the ground.
1836273	1837634	Like, I can't believe they just said that.
1838014	1838594	But it was funny.
1838954	1841575	I totally want an icon of their expressions in that picture.
1843896	1845596	You are fags.
1846557	1847317	That was awesome.
1850512	1855174	Anyhow, let's get into tonight's... Oh, wait, really quickly, one more housekeeping thing.
1855234	1856094	I'm so horrible.
1856274	1859776	This week marks the fifth anniversary of Xbox Live.
1859836	1860416	Can you believe it?
1860476	1868699	November 15th is the day that Xbox Live turns five, which made me think this week, one, we're older than Xbox Live because we're five and a half years old.
1869800	1870520	But still, rock on.
1870540	1872101	We were here from the beginning.
1872221	1874822	Rock on for Xbox Live turning five this week.
1874842	1876642	And they're doing, like, all these types of contests.
1876943	1880324	And who knows what other kind of crap is going to be up on Xbox, like
1880714	1890117	Cool, you know, retrospective stuff and maybe some new trailers and icons and backgrounds and I'm sure they're going to celebrate over there at Xbox.
1890557	1894159	The reason why I say that is that Xbox Live is very good with the community.
1894539	1906443	You know, like, out of probably the big three, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Microsoft's very good with the community and I think, therefore, the community should support them for, you know, reaching out and caring about the independent scene.
1906743	1908904	So, hurrah to you guys at Xbox.
1909699	1911619	Speaking of Xbox, let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1911679	1912380	Loki, kick it off.
1912860	1915820	Yes, so the fall update's coming.
1916380	1917641	It just might not be for fall.
1918461	1922902	It's actually going to be hitting sometime in December.
1923762	1928023	And one thing that will be coming with it, of course, is the Xbox 360 Family Timer.
1928063	1933384	Of course, that is going to be something that your parents will be able to use to limit the time that kiddies get to play.
1934224	1938685	You can limit it down to like two hours, and then after those two hours are up, they have to play...
1939113	1943778	or wait 24 hours before they can play their Xbox 360 again.
1944198	1948462	I think that's an awesome idea that they're able to limit stuff like that play time.
1951145	1953747	No word though what else will be coming.
1955189	1956170	on that update as well.
1956250	1960432	But of course, usually with those dashboard updates, there's a bit more stuff on there.
1961132	1966535	Hopefully some more video playback stuff so we can play some DivX maybe, Xvid, that would be nice.
1966775	1967215	Good times.
1967515	1971877	More high def stuff over the internet, not the internet, but the local network would be awesome.
1972718	1974278	Then I can watch my Dragon Force music videos.
1975619	1976740	They have music videos?
1977040	1978280	On iTunes, there's some for sale.
1978681	1979901	And they're just as epic as you'd think.
1979921	1980842	I'll just go to YouTube.
1980902	1981242	There you go.
1982540	1988482	Last week, if you're listening to last week's show, we were kind of joking probably more than we needed to about Kmart.
1989222	1990163	Remember Kmart?
1990203	1997045	And one thing that came up, we were talking about is that one of the good things that Kmart is there for is that they tend to break street dates.
1997425	1999445	And that was totally proven this week.
1999766	2002326	I would like to say, did we call it or did we call it on last week's show?
2002746	2007488	Sure enough, Kmart has been spotted with copies of Mass Effect.
2008489	2034026	Kmart sold a copy of Mass Effect, it looks like in Cropton, Maryland And they are so going to be in trouble tomorrow They're going to be busted, they're going to get the smackdown on that And I believe that was sold Friday or yesterday That's ten days before the official release date of the game And of course the guy bought it and promptly put a picture of it up on the internet with a receipt So you knew he wasn't full of crap So everybody's saying run and check Kmart and see if this is there Because you never know
2034700	2035880	And he's not the only one, too.
2035940	2041041	There's another guy, too, off of the CheapAssGames forum, I believe, that got one as well.
2041822	2042442	So there you have it.
2042482	2046022	If you want to get your games early, Kmart's the place to go.
2046122	2050843	I forgot to check the local one, but I'm sure a lot of the local kids already beat me to it.
2050963	2051704	Yeah, no thanks.
2051844	2052904	I don't want to go to Kmart.
2053084	2053364	I know.
2054264	2055164	I can wait 10 days.
2055224	2056625	I can go there if I need socks.
2057485	2061065	I do want to say, though, Loki was showing off the lesbian scene.
2062006	2062566	That was hot.
2062586	2063406	It was very artistic.
2064031	2064852	That was hot.
2065052	2066193	I like how you could respond.
2066233	2067454	Very artistically done.
2067474	2068235	Let's do it again.
2068275	2069056	Let's do it again.
2069296	2069937	Let's go again.
2069977	2070497	That was it.
2070597	2071298	Let's party.
2071979	2072939	Let's party.
2074921	2080987	Anyway, there is a list of the download content available for Rock Band.
2083314	2086295	I think this is actually a pretty good list.
2087455	2092996	We've got on here, there's a police pack with Roxanne, Synchronicity 2, Can't Stand Losing You.
2093136	2097557	There's a Queens of Stone Age pack, a Metallica pack that's unannounced.
2098297	2103018	Black Sabbath, David Bowie, and I like that it's got Queen Bitch in it.
2105018	2107519	There's a punk pack that has ever fallen in love.
2108437	2112298	by the Buzzcocks, I Fought the Law by The Clash, and Rockaway Beach by the Ramones.
2112358	2113558	It's like a classic there.
2114798	2122700	Then there's some single songs, which is Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jukebox Hero by Foreigner, My Sharona, Cherry Bomb.
2123440	2124360	I like The Runaways.
2124720	2128961	I actually have that album.
2129041	2132121	It was Joan Jett and Lita Ford.
2133121	2133842	That was great.
2135342	2136302	Actually, that's funny.
2136812	2138613	Oh, I was going to say there's one that's on there.
2139053	2140274	Buddy Holly by Weezer.
2140494	2142215	I'm actually looking forward to buying that.
2142675	2150700	I was actually going to say there's one song in that, as much as I love Weezer, but there's one song in there that completely just makes me go ha ha.
2151400	2152841	My Iron Lung by Radiohead.
2153101	2154182	I love Radiohead.
2154202	2155062	Radiohead's pretty awesome.
2155482	2157263	I love Radiohead.
2157283	2158984	You know, Creep is in the actual game as well.
2159485	2159905	I know.
2160936	2162017	But I love Radiohead.
2162057	2166019	But I would like to point out there is still a distinct lack of Journey in this list.
2166179	2167039	Hey, give it time.
2167419	2167860	Give it time.
2168100	2170501	I want my fucking Don't Stop Believin', dammit.
2170521	2171502	Maybe they're the ones.
2171542	2173443	Maybe it's Journey's fault that this stuff isn't there.
2173463	2176544	Maybe they're like little bitches that don't want their fucking music to be in this game.
2176704	2177305	Now, fuck this.
2177325	2178385	We remember the Journey game.
2178445	2178985	It sucked.
2179005	2180406	We're just not going to put our music in anything.
2180426	2181147	But Radiohead.
2181727	2182467	Radiohead is cool.
2182507	2183088	I'll take that.
2183168	2183728	Radiohead.
2184542	2189785	Well, you know, I was still on the fence about Rock Band, and I'm like, I don't want to spend the $170 on the game.
2190486	2194488	But then I was watching some trailers online last night, and keep in mind, I was kind of drunk.
2195289	2203254	We drank a lot last night, and the people over here at Guitar Hero, and we were just all in here watching the Rock Band footage going, Oh, we need to get this game.
2204174	2205175	It looks so hot.
2205255	2205956	I'm definitely getting it.
2206176	2207056	I think I'm going to have to get it, too.
2207076	2208817	My wife is going to buy it for me for Christmas.
2209458	2210739	We've already decided to get it.
2211519	2212940	It looks like we're going to have our own little band.
2213624	2214884	and hopefully I'll have it early.
2216145	2216465	Awesome.
2218426	2222347	Odd1 says, yes, my Iron Lung is my fave song of the bends.
2222387	2223727	That is so spectacular.
2224007	2225068	That is such a good song.
2225228	2229949	Although I have to say overall, my all-time favorite Radiohead song is High and Dry.
2230509	2231950	I know, I was going to say, I want High and Dry.
2232350	2233390	Don't leave me.
2233970	2236691	But that wouldn't be so rock bandy.
2236911	2237611	You know what I mean?
2237631	2238152	It wouldn't work.
2238192	2239052	My Iron Lung is...
2239896	2242017	Probably one of the perfect ones to have in that.
2242277	2246779	And Mac Man in our chat room is urging me to hold on to that feelings, guy.
2248280	2248560	I will.
2248820	2249060	I will.
2249860	2252342	I'm going to write Journey's fan club or something.
2253582	2254963	Know somebody who knows the band.
2254983	2255563	That's right.
2255703	2256403	I keep forgetting.
2256443	2258584	We have a friend who knows Journey.
2258664	2260985	He gave me guitar picks from them.
2261005	2261726	We need this to happen.
2261766	2265067	If you're listening, said friend, I need to have some words with Journey.
2265107	2265767	Can we make that happen?
2266268	2266588	Anyhow.
2266608	2267808	We should get them on the show.
2268529	2269009	For real.
2270114	2270634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2295382	2296102	Screw these!
2325356	2330599	with, of course, the comment from EA saying that there's really not going to be a lot out there.
2332060	2333841	There's a pretty good chance it's going to be hard to find.
2334181	2340645	And from the other side, my work side, I can definitely say that there's one hell of a shortage on
2341092	2342974	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2361081	2361522	DarkSakura.com
2373251	2373711	DarkSakura,
2393181	2394522	Those are going to be readily available.
2394922	2398523	But it's just getting the game with that new guitar is going to be hard to find.
2398623	2402945	So if you don't care about having the new guitar, because to be honest, it's a wireless big deal.
2402985	2404545	The wired one works just fine.
2405346	2410788	But if that's the case, then get the game by itself, buy a guitar later.
2411368	2412408	But that's the thing.
2412448	2412909	That's why.
2412949	2414189	It's because of these new instruments.
2414229	2419671	And I bet you anything if they change the design of the guitar for Guitar Hero 4, we're going to be talking about this all over again.
2420472	2421652	So that's why.
2422571	2424176	Well thank you for that report.
2425615	2430496	Well, if you have Guitar Hero 3, there's already some downloadable content available for it.
2430536	2433277	Like I mentioned earlier, I downloaded the Foo Fighters pack for the game.
2433917	2434717	That is up and running.
2435117	2439558	And the Foo Fighters pack has The Pretender, All My Life, and the classic This Is A Call.
2439578	2440919	That was like their very first single, I think.
2441339	2443359	Although, you know what it was sadly missing?
2443839	2447360	Was A, Everlong, but I think that song was in Guitar Hero 2, so I think that's why.
2447720	2448961	B, Big Me.
2449761	2450561	That song was awesome.
2450601	2452022	It had the Mentos in the video.
2452062	2452462	Remember that?
2452882	2453882	Back when MTV played videos?
2455200	2457280	Velvet Revolver also has a pack of their own.
2457320	2466222	I didn't buy it yet because I'm not as familiar with Velvet Revolver, but maybe... I hear they actually put trailers on Xbox Live of these packs so you could hear the songs beforehand, which is great.
2466542	2470023	I think that was a great way to kind of answer that demand of we want to hear this shit before we buy it.
2470323	2472184	So props to Microsoft for getting around that.
2472784	2481025	But Velvet Revolver, if you do want to buy that, if you're a fan of the band, because I do believe Velvet Revolver is the band that's made up of... Wasn't that Stone Temple Pilots plus the guy from Soundgarden?
2481145	2482766	I do believe... No, Chris Cornell has...
2484645	2487390	I'm missing my groups.
2487550	2490054	Sorry, I haven't been following my rock bands very well.
2490295	2492418	I'm going to get yelled at by chat.
2492438	2496164	I think Chris Cornell had a different band, but I think it was somebody else that was in Soundgarden.
2496765	2497266	I want to say.
2497507	2497747	All right.
2498035	2500477	Velvet Revolver is members of Guns N' Roses and Scott Weiland.
2527433	2529734	Oh, okay, I had it the other way around or something.
2530315	2532656	What the hell am I thinking of that had the guy from Soundgarden?
2533176	2533576	Chris Cornell.
2533596	2534197	Audioslave.
2534237	2535297	Audioslave, that was it.
2535317	2535617	God damn it.
2536438	2537899	Because I was like, yeah, he has a different band.
2538679	2541601	Although... Anyway, sorry.
2542301	2542661	My bad.
2545122	2546663	Look, I listen to pop music, all right?
2546683	2548044	I was going to mention one thing real quick.
2548104	2549245	Unless it's Dragon Forge or Journey.
2549385	2551106	Since this story didn't make it into the...
2552367	2553747	Showroll, because it was too late.
2554268	2557188	The Wii Guitar Hero 3, it only outputs in mono.
2558009	2559689	Go monophonic sound!
2559889	2560650	Go Nintendo!
2560750	2561170	Ouch.
2561550	2562930	Actually, it's probably Activision.
2564511	2565471	Yay, mono!
2568112	2568332	Well.
2570913	2581816	Well, there is something for anyone who is looking forward to playing Guitar Hero 3 on the PC, is the 360's wireless Les Paul controller will work on the PC.
2582830	2584651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2613468	2616229	Add the wireless gaming receiver with it.
2616389	2617910	Might as well do the wired version.
2618770	2628835	Well, the other thing, though... I've actually... When we were at Best Buy, I think it was, we actually saw a two-guitar pack for Guitar Hero 3.
2628875	2629155	Yeah.
2630095	2635918	And I think that it would be pointless for them to not release the same kind of pack for PC as well.
2637238	2638199	I mean, really...
2639423	2643385	There's so many USB guitars out there now with Guitar Hero.
2643625	2645926	Just find one that you want and then buy it.
2646486	2648347	Well, the Explorer controller was kind of ugly.
2649147	2652349	Plus, they figure that you're buying all these games.
2652389	2653729	Your friends probably own some of the games.
2653749	2655690	You're going to play two-player if your friend doesn't come over.
2655790	2656711	Have them bring their own guitar.
2657551	2659452	I heart the Explorer, by the way.
2659492	2660392	BYOG!
2660412	2664654	I'm sorry, the Les Paul is a lot more hot.
2665775	2665995	Well...
2666499	2675582	This is kind of going back a couple months, but people might remember that there were some issues with the widescreen in the Xbox 360 version of Bioshock.
2676142	2683785	Well, 2K is going to be fixing these problems very soon with the next update that's going to be coming out, so all you people can stop bitching about it.
2684725	2692628	Although I think a lot of people have stopped bitching about it and moved on to other games like Halo 3 and games that are possibly coming out next week, so I don't know.
2693291	2693731	Viva Piñata
2722658	2726059	I'm sure we've had, I think there was the story of the marriage proposal in World of Warcraft.
2726539	2730580	Well, now we have a story tonight about a Halo 3 marriage proposal.
2730880	2741803	Yes, it was somebody using the forge, the map editor inside Halo 3 to lay down guns and swords in the shape of the words, marry me?
2743043	2743583	Very cute.
2744503	2745083	What was the answer?
2745884	2747724	I'm assuming it was yes, but we don't know.
2747784	2749244	All we really know is the screenshot.
2749545	2751265	The answer was, boom, headshot.
2752786	2753346	Yay!
2753567	2755327	She said yes and then promptly shot him in the head.
2755588	2757669	And then proceeded to hump his corpse.
2759129	2759810	The end.
2760550	2762071	Which might be like the honeymoon, who knows.
2762791	2763131	Anyway.
2763692	2765793	La la la la la la la la la.
2765833	2772556	The Xbox user was Moviesign and he was proposing to his longtime girlfriend, Furtive Penguin.
2775217	2776458	I love Xbox Live names.
2778217	2778277	Sgt.
2778297	2778437	Sausage
2807951	2808472	I guess.
2808872	2809233	I don't know.
2810034	2814659	You know, if you're a real Halo 3 fan, you're going to play Halo 3, I guess.
2815019	2815620	I know.
2815660	2816941	You're not going to go out and do anything else.
2816981	2817963	You're just going to play Halo all day.
2818063	2825431	Well, speaking of which, there is some download content that Bungie has given us some information on.
2826132	2828554	Well, not us directly, but they've just given it.
2828614	2829095	They give it up.
2831327	2835788	Anyway, there are some maps that are going to be coming to the Xbox Live Marketplace.
2836969	2846133	One of them is the OK Corral, which is described as an asymmetrical, medium-sized map.
2847253	2849434	So you can fight at high noon at the OK Corral?
2850254	2850774	I guess so.
2850794	2851555	It's a little silly.
2851675	2852895	In your armor, whatever.
2853535	2859658	And then there's one called Purple Rain, spelled R-E-I-G-N, and Jodrell Bank.
2860802	2863803	and then Vandelay, which is a simple map.
2865344	2868886	So, anyway.
2868946	2872908	You know what, when you say that map is called Purple Rain, you know what that makes me think of?
2878110	2883573	Which was not a good movie, no matter what anyone says.
2884794	2889416	Prince is still awesome, even if he's gone crazy in the past five years and now he's suing his fans.
2890126	2891407	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2891788	2892048	What?
2892888	2896111	He's like suing these websites that use pictures of him.
2896151	2903457	It's like his fan websites, but they use pictures of him and like tattoos of him and his symbols and stuff because he owns them.
2904017	2905058	But they're like fan sites.
2905118	2906379	Why would you bite the hand that feeds you?
2906820	2907540	Because you're crazy.
2907560	2908601	Yeah, because he's crazy.
2909202	2910543	But still, he wrote Purple Rain.
2910563	2913905	And come on, tell me you do not want to play Halo with this as a custom soundtrack.
2916988	2919490	Everybody, Purple Rain.
2920763	2920963	No.
2921684	2922264	Do not want.
2923945	2925146	I actually do like that song.
2925166	2925466	Failed.
2926627	2927107	Let's see.
2927447	2929789	What you might be able to be doing pretty soon.
2929869	2932650	Oh my God, Chocolate Rain.
2933671	2934392	Chocolate Rain.
2934632	2938214	Hmasterosha in the chat says, I guess better than Chocolate Rain?
2938254	2939154	Have you heard the song?
2940055	2940916	I don't want to hear that song.
2940936	2942156	Yeah, I've heard Chocolate Rain.
2942537	2944698	I actually saw the live performance of Chocolate Rain.
2945319	2945760	Yeah, I don't care.
2945880	2952469	There was a guy at my work who was telling everybody about it and he started singing it in his cubicle and I thought it was the most hilarious freaking thing I'd ever heard.
2952850	2953751	And that's how I heard about it.
2953952	2955514	Actdeft says Vampire Reign?
2956508	2959590	Don't let the rain, no, what?
2982522	2989245	and I guess there's a huge loud noise which popped up occasionally on Endurance that they've fixed.
2990145	2998889	Some other fun things, they have another problem with display updates when viewing through a VGA cable.
2999829	3005571	They've added some stuff, the Friends leaderboard now shows extra information such as grade and accuracy, etc.
3006772	3011854	Multiplayer Endurance mode fix for players color swapping sporadically
3012835	3015357	and slightly bigger and better explosions.
3016618	3019020	You gotta love an update that adds bigger explosions.
3025565	3027266	Oh, tell me it's gonna have a chorus in here.
3028627	3031069	All I could find was a bad karaoke version of this song.
3031209	3036373	Ah, I was trying to do Blame It on the Rain.
3036913	3038374	This sucks.
3039655	3040356	I ruined the show.
3040396	3040836	I'm sorry.
3041854	3042314	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3065137	3065878	Let's move on.
3065978	3067599	When was the last time she was on the show?
3067739	3070982	Marissa was on the show a long time ago.
3071002	3071762	You need to come back.
3072643	3073904	Tell us some more of your stories.
3074224	3076066	Marissa, come back on the show, okay?
3076266	3078768	And then do the Russian lady bra story.
3081110	3083091	Loki, have you tried Boom Boom Rocket with a guitar yet?
3083472	3083692	Nope.
3084172	3085153	I just might have to try that.
3085173	3085833	That sounds like fun.
3086394	3088556	I saw the YouTube-age, though, of the developers playing it.
3088576	3088976	Pretty funny.
3089790	3090171	Good times.
3090431	3094478	DDR might be interesting, but I can only play that game if it was actually set up like DDR.
3094518	3096581	How about DDR and the guitar at the same time?
3097002	3097422	OMG.
3098164	3098745	Lame.
3100381	3109187	If you have not yet checked out Two Worlds because of the very mixed reviews on it, well, there is now a demo available on the Xbox Live Marketplace, so you can check that out.
3109247	3110508	It's a demo of Two Worlds.
3110768	3117253	Of course, this is a game that's supposed to kind of cater to the fans of Oblivion, but it's supposed to be bigger, badder, and better, and it has multiplayer.
3117273	3122496	Well, their problem was saying it's the most ultimate, like, best RPG ever.
3123317	3124097	That was the problem.
3124257	3125398	They shouldn't have marketed it as...
3125796	3126676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3146613	3148414	Shit, what is wrong with these people?
3148734	3150855	Oh, look, we found 50 bugs later on.
3151836	3156378	You know, I could understand if we found two bugs or something like that, but 50, come on, that's just lazy.
3158740	3159280	Good times.
3159300	3161041	It's not buggy enough, we don't want it.
3161561	3162322	Oh, but don't worry.
3162962	3165523	I'm sure the PlayStation 3 version will be coming out soon.
3165843	3167044	Oh, talk about bugs there.
3167885	3173828	Well, anyway, how about something that's a little bit more cool for people with the iPod who want iPod games?
3174508	3175869	Harmonix is giving us
3176513	3188644	Phase, which is pretty much a very low graphical, given it's an iPod version, sort of, of, I guess it plays sort of like Guitar Hero is supposed to.
3189485	3197632	But it's... Yeah, it's this, they all are like the same freaking sort of game, essentially, in terms of their gameplay.
3199254	3202457	But it's you, your songs will interface with
3203639	3204720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3220424	3221985	Give me some iPhone games, people!
3222285	3223045	I can play it on mine.
3223605	3224706	Well, I still have an iPod.
3225006	3227087	And DarkTetsuya says you can play a Dragon Force on it.
3227267	3227667	Heck yeah.
3228147	3233750	Actually, yeah, the phase kind of looks like frequency and amplitude and all that stuff, but it has some zigzag stuff.
3233770	3238732	Like, it looks like you can drag back and forth, which I imagine, you know, using the dial, you could do.
3239312	3240973	But that kind of came out of nowhere, didn't it?
3241133	3242574	Nobody knew this game was coming, but...
3243390	3244010	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3274611	3275192	Official ones.
3275212	3275973	You can do the Nintendo emulator.
3276013	3277595	I do agree that they do need iPhone games.
3277635	3278295	That is not official.
3278716	3278896	True.
3279056	3280198	I don't want to brick my iPhone.
3280218	3284703	I mean, because if you paid a couple hundred dollars for a fucking phone, you better have something that plays games on it.
3285724	3286104	Seriously.
3286304	3287886	But I do have the YouTube channel.
3288887	3290629	And the YouTube channel makes everything better.
3291690	3293072	Give me a YouTube channel and Wii.
3293332	3293853	That'd be cool.
3294434	3305022	Anyways, so something that's kind of sad, I guess, for some people in the media would be that the NPD group is going to be withholding their hardware sales numbers from the media.
3305863	3309886	And so they won't know exactly what consoles they're selling and stuff like that.
3310586	3311507	So sad.
3312608	3312928	Oh, wait.
3313468	3314509	That won't affect me at all.
3315930	3318272	So are you going to continue to report the numbers to us here on the show?
3318312	3319012	Fuck yeah, I will.
3319553	3319873	Awesome.
3320534	3321454	So, yeah.
3322035	3322355	So sad.
3322932	3326593	But no, not that it really matters anyways because it's fucking console sale numbers.
3326633	3330414	I mean, they'll have some stupid press release that each company will release.
3330714	3333915	Because you know Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft are not going to shut up about it.
3333955	3337595	And obviously they're going to release what their console sold.
3337715	3340876	So it's not like you're so left out about it.
3341036	3344057	But I'll be happy to report them.
3344597	3345057	All right.
3345317	3350378	Well, some numbers that maybe we can be reporting on soon are these new games that are coming out from around the world.
3350398	3352419	We're going to start tonight with Japanese release dates.
3353058	3353859	Biohazard Umbrella Chronicles
3369810	3373251	Also, there is that bundle that's coming with the gun with it, so that'd be cool.
3373291	3377592	Heavenly Sword makes its way to the Japanese stores November 15th as well.
3378113	3383074	Also coming out in Japan, Soku Kihei Votoms is coming out for the PlayStation 2.
3383934	3384554	Hey, that's cool.
3384714	3386435	Looks like another MechWarrior game.
3386735	3388116	Actually, that's fairly old school.
3388356	3392137	Votoms, I believe, has something to do with the Gundam universe.
3392717	3392857	Oh.
3392897	3393037	Yeah.
3393806	3396207	Yeah, well, it's coming from Bandai, so that would make sense.
3396227	3398427	Big surprise!
3398487	3405109	Coming out also on the PlayStation 2 is a game called Hayatakami 2 is coming out.
3405149	3407029	This looks like a survival horror-ish game to me.
3407049	3411911	It looks very Silent Hill from the cover, but this isn't something I don't think we have over here.
3412411	3413211	So, there you have it.
3413752	3414673	DarkSakura, Cooking Mama 2, Taito
3435555	3436576	A Peanuts game!
3436916	3437537	Remember the Peanuts?
3437577	3439238	Peanuts is still very, kind of big.
3439458	3441780	There's like been a sort of trendy thing lately.
3442101	3443442	And the games don't stop coming.
3443662	3447765	Snoopy to isho no ni DS, I go lesson.
3447805	3451108	It looks like some type of training game for the DS using the Snoopy characters.
3451128	3452369	Snoopy and us together.
3453050	3455092	Yeah, it looks like some type of like training game.
3455192	3456893	It's Snoopy and us together English lesson.
3457654	3458054	Oh fun.
3458074	3458795	Yeah.
3458855	3459055	Yeah.
3459990	3465973	Also coming out, this will be the last game for Japan on November 15th, another version of Dungeon Explorer.
3466233	3471996	But on the PSP, and I've got to say, the box arts are very different, so I'm wondering if the games aren't pretty different as well.
3472536	3475538	Two completely different versions of Dungeon Explorer.
3476158	3477419	There you have it, Japanese release dates.
3477879	3483902	Our UK release dates, on the 13th we have Evercrack 2, Rise of Karnak, or sorry, Kunark.
3484202	3484943	Why did I say Karnak?
3484963	3485383	Kunark!
3486648	3488669	Wasn't Karnak Johnny Carson's character?
3488749	3494251	No, that's... I'm thinking... Ah, forget it.
3495011	3495251	Egypt.
3495471	3495691	Anyway.
3496872	3498232	15th, Orcs and Elves.
3499032	3499973	Yay on DS.
3500753	3503494	16th, Alan Hansen Sports Challenge on Wii.
3504134	3506615	Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am.
3507415	3510696	That's the best name ever, and it would be great if it wasn't Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
3511397	3511837	It's a bad name.
3511877	3512237	It sucks.
3513286	3529261	Assassin's Creed on Xbox 360 and PS3, Avatar The Burning Earth, which I want, because I like Avatar, but I need to watch more of it, Beowulf on the 16th, Blacksite Area 51, Crisis with a Y on PC,

3581670	3589212	Super Mario Galaxy on Wii, Team Fortress 2, PlayStation 3, The Orange Box, PlayStation 3, Warriors of the Lost Empire.
3589612	3593913	I'm guessing those are probably just all in the Orange Box, and they probably just list them separate as well.
3594213	3599694	Well, I think that they actually are getting separate sales, and then you get them bundled as the Orange Box.
3599714	3600194	That's weird.
3600514	3601474	I don't know why they would do that.
3602734	3605035	The only game in that whole pack I care about is Portal.
3605635	3605915	You're right.
3607190	3609931	The US has way too many damn releases, that's for sure.
3610791	3612251	Let's see, starting off with the big stuff.

3738452	3738692	Yes.
3739654	3740595	I'm getting that game.
3741597	3741998	Sweet.
3742058	3743020	Remember, the movie is PG-13.
3743060	3749953	The game is M. The nice thing about Angelina Jolie is that she seriously transcends...
3750876	3751797	All sexualities.
3751817	3757662	You know, not only straight men find her hot, gay men find her hot, straight women find her hot, lesbians find her hot.
3757722	3761245	I mean, who doesn't find me somebody that does not find Angelina Jolie hot?
3761425	3763447	Chat room, if you say she's not hot, you're lying.
3763507	3764368	I already know this.
3764408	3767891	King of Fighters 11 coming out this week on PlayStation 2 for only $19.99.
3768732	3772035	I thought it was actually $14.99, but I could be wrong.

3801206	3801506	Not.
3803467	3803847	Anyways.

3854293	3856233	I'm so glad we took time out in the show to acknowledge.
3856253	3857574	Dude, that game is awesome.
3857714	3859355	Don't be mocking it.
3859595	3864357	Smarty Pants on the Wii, another quiz game by EA.
3865797	3866497	Let's see here.
3867438	3868338	There's too much shit.
3868478	3870539	Oh, Puzzle Quest on the PlayStation 2.
3871339	3873900	Odd One wants to know, can I make the hamsters eat their young?
3874541	3875261	That's all that matters.
3876466	3877526	Somehow I don't think so.
3877927	3880849	Chat.orangeonsradio.com That would be awesome if you could.
3882411	3883151	Let's see here.
3884773	3888716	And then I think that's maybe about it.
3888916	3892460	Macman would like to say about the are you smarter than a fifth grader game on the DS.
3892940	3895823	If you buy that game, you aren't smarter than a fifth grader.
3895843	3899065	You know, you're just a consumer whore, that's all.
3899686	3900146	Pretty much.
3900647	3900887	You know.
3901832	3904714	Escapist says, hey, I have my pre-order on Baby Pals.
3904774	3906455	Thank goodness Loki reminded me of it.

3915202	3916022	I want that game.
3917183	3920706	Imagine Fashion Designer on PC, in case you know.
3921246	3922427	Imagine Babies.
3923808	3925189	Imagine Babies.
3925449	3926090	That would be funny.
3927250	3927350	Um...
3929645	3931706	Sonic Rivals 2 on PSP.
3932126	3933226	Christ, I thought you were done!
3933986	3937487	I thought I was done too, but hey, this is the biggest week of the year, okay?
3937907	3941728	Game release-wise, so I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.
3943549	3947490	And America's Army 2, True Soldiers on the Xbox 360.
3951491	3951851	Whatever.
3952131	3954211	Oh, Impossible Mission on the DS.
3954732	3955452	We'll end it right there.
3955712	3955952	All right.
3956748	3958229	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3986849	3990812	Target strives to provide merchandise that will appeal to a wide variety of guests.
3991192	3994333	We also want guests to be comfortable with the purchasing decisions they make at Target.
3994734	4001237	All video games and computer software sold at Target currently carry ratings by the ESRB from early childhood through mature audiences.
4001597	4009942	While Manhunt 2 was given a mature rating by the ESRB, we received additional information that players can potentially view previously filtered content by altering the game code.
4010322	4012303	As a result, we have decided not to carry the game.
4013214	4019597	because I'm sure the millions of people that shop at Target know how to do this to hack their PSP to unlock all the content.
4021618	4022318	I don't know about you guys.
4022338	4023199	I think it's a little silly.
4023659	4025420	But I guess it's their choice.
4025780	4027001	People just get it other places.
4027161	4028642	Apparently, Target doesn't like money.
4029882	4030342	I guess not.
4030502	4031023	So sad.
4031443	4034164	I mean, is Manhunt 2 really going to be that big a big seller?
4034264	4036325	It's one of those games that's kind of all talk.
4036485	4036906	You know what I mean?
4037486	4038166	It is all talk.
4039487	4039667	Yeah.
4039929	4043210	Well, still, this news about Manhunt 2 makes me very angry.
4043250	4047071	I don't know about you guys, but I get very angsty when I hear about this kind of censorship.
4047471	4049772	And that means we need to do the FUs of the week.
4060455	4062515	Jamie, do you have any FUs you'd like to share with us?
4063255	4064476	FU to Mr. Annoying.
4066316	4066957	My co-worker.
4067797	4068257	Sorry to hear it.
4069241	4072222	When I go to work, I do not want to hear the word of God!
4074543	4082485	I don't want to hear, oh, my productivity sucks, and then see you get up from your desk 50,000 times a day and not do your crap.
4082505	4087466	I'm tired of you bitching like a menopausal woman.
4089567	4090127	Just shut up.
4091387	4092808	But thank you for helping me with my work.
4093628	4097869	Loki, if you're not having more time during the day to play games,
4098939	4099599	That's all I got.
4100319	4102320	My FU goes to work drama.
4102520	4104320	Although, I don't think things have been going that bad.
4104360	4111021	I actually, you know, I still love my job and what I do day time, but there was a little bit of drama this past week, but it's nothing we'll get past.
4111201	4114302	It's just, you know, getting through it is a little bit of an FU.
4116262	4116582	That's all.
4117243	4118203	FU to drama in general.
4119023	4120043	Don't want no drama.
4120203	4120783	Do not want.
4122584	4124744	Moving on with this week's gaming news then.
4125856	4145981	well for uh people who've been keeping up with the news on the Max Payne movie 20th Century Fox has asked Mark Wahlberg to be in it and he said okay at least that's what we're hearing so far so um I think it'll be cool with him in it I mean he's a good actor better than his rap career
4146684	4151725	He was pretty good in The Departed as an angry cop, and he's also good in The Wii on the night as an angry cop.
4151785	4153785	He was great in Boogie Nights.
4154846	4157726	And in this movie where he plays an angry cop, it should work.
4158246	4161307	So, yeah, I think he's got the angry cop roll down.
4162447	4167608	Anyways, Akira Yamaoka is actually working on a brand new game series.
4167788	4173830	Of course, it's untitled yet, but glad to know that he's moving beyond Silent Hill.
4173850	4175150	At least I
4175623	4177723	I think he's moving on beyond Silent Hill.
4178384	4179944	It could be Silent Hill the Musical, maybe.
4180884	4181744	That would be awesome.
4182364	4188546	No, but no idea what kind of game it is, what platform it is, but he says it should be announced soon.
4189906	4191446	So it's coming soon.
4191886	4192147	Soon.
4192167	4195247	But if it's coming from Akira Yamaoka, like seriously, how can it be bad?
4195267	4196447	That's what I want to know.
4196467	4197348	It can't really be bad.
4197448	4200288	But, yeah, I don't know.
4201028	4203489	I kind of feel left out with Konami right now.
4204138	4204919	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4233646	4234707	You guys need to check out.
4234827	4235847	It's the classic game of the week.
4238229	4241111	DarkSakura, what is this week's pick for the classic game of the week?
4241591	4245153	I've brought this game up several times, and it's just about damn time I said something about it.
4245713	4249015	Today's game of the week is Blazing Star for the Neo Geo.
4250316	4250836	Very cool.
4250936	4253538	And we actually will play some clips from Blazing Star.
4253578	4255259	I'm trying to get into some actual gameplay here.
4255519	4256880	Because the intro song is good.
4256900	4257921	You want to do the intro?
4257961	4258501	Yeah, why not?
4261078	4264600	And the intro is all, you know, rendered and pretty and everything.
4264620	4270123	But the game itself is, it's for the most part 2D with some CG.
4270243	4271724	So it's pretty, pretty sweet.
4272404	4276146	And it's basically, like I was saying, a side-scrolling shooter.
4277287	4280869	It's actually fairly, it's the sequel to Polestar.
4281249	4285111	And Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star is just really, really good.
4285892	4289994	And it's actually related to R-Type in it.
4290598	4292098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4316345	4318026	Are they going to put this on a virtual console?
4318066	4318547	I hope so.
4318807	4319367	I've never played this.
4319387	4319747	They better.
4320068	4331736	Well, you know, I had actually played this quite a bit when I lived in Alabama, and I was very sad because the machine that I played it on was actually broken into, and the cartridge stole it out of it.
4332376	4332557	Ouch.
4333097	4335819	It was one of those multi-AVS machines.
4337400	4340142	But anyway, Crestview Lanes.
4340970	4341570	DarkSakura.com
4363570	4365731	Oh, you're timed on the bosses, I noticed.
4365751	4366951	Yeah, you are timed on the bosses.
4367411	4372113	And if you don't beat them within the time limit, you still progress, but you don't get the points for beating the boss.
4372473	4372753	Huh.
4373373	4374054	That's kind of different.
4375374	4375834	Very cool.
4376274	4377615	And if I'm right, I think it takes life.
4378635	4378935	Wow.
4379895	4380416	You beat it.
4380456	4381396	Your skill is great.
4382645	4383746	That's the congratulatory message.
4383786	4389649	You also collect letters as you go through and it gives you more power-ups and bonuses as you go through the game.
4389949	4390789	Awesome.
4391130	4396993	But it is basically, you have a fire button and you have a bomb button.
4397213	4398273	And you have charged attacks.
4400074	4402896	So it's very, very, very, very cool.
4403436	4404157	Good times.
4404397	4408999	And people complained that Blazing Star was sort of, you know, dumbed down for its difficulty from Polestar.
4409660	4410240	I disagree.
4411178	4421964	Blazing Star is still pretty damn hard once you get past the first few stages, but it's just really... I think that my favorite ship to play in that game is the Green one.
4423925	4424285	Alright.
4424905	4431309	I don't know, the graphics in this game, for some reason, I don't know why, it reminds me a little bit of UN Squadron, just the art style, for some reason.
4432208	4432889	I don't know what it is.
4459036	4467847	Well, that's going to bring us to a close here for Part A of our podcast, but fear not, because we tape for several hours every Sunday night, and Part B will be on its way.
4467887	4473034	For those of you guys listening on the podcast feed, we'll see you in a couple days here with Orange Launch Radio Part B. Stay tuned.
