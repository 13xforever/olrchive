13927	19168	Tonight, June 24th, 2007, our introduction takes a little trip down memory lane.
20849	22329	Hey, where are we going?
30511	35892	Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
59213	85747	and now for our feature presentation Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content so you probably shouldn't let your children listen
86901	95124	If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!
96544	100005	Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
104906	109668	Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.
109928	112549	Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.
112969	116470	He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
117381	120204	Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
120564	121365	Sandburgers!
122105	124247	The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
124467	125248	That was huge.
126810	127430	Cool.
127770	130733	Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?
131814	133616	That's right.
133656	135537	The only thing you're gonna be riding is me.
135998	137779	Have you seen my... Lena?
138160	141723	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.
142023	142764	So it was you.
143721	145883	DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,
166588	171849	We are live on this June the 24th of 2007.
172970	175110	Good God, that was a bloated ass intro.
175130	178351	That was actually... That was one of our old intros.
178391	180212	That intro was like two minutes long.
180752	181392	Go figure.
182912	184613	We actually used that for like a year.
185153	189774	Anyway, hi and welcome to that show dedicated not just to Bomani now, but after...
190365	196008	Several years on the air, we evolved to talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.
196068	197129	My name is Rob Roberts.
197529	201371	Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
201851	202172	Hi.
205493	207394	Five years, and that's all you have to say is, ah.
208235	208595	Hi.
208635	210016	That's how I'd sum it up, too, really.
211420	213762	and also say hello as always to Tech Master Loki.
213902	214182	Hello.
214742	215403	How you doing, Loki?
215863	216683	I'm doing fine.
216964	217264	All right.
217324	217824	Sounds good.
218204	219205	Well, there you have it.
219245	222107	It's just the three of us tonight because tonight is a special night.
222167	223728	It is our fifth anniversary show.
224228	232754	And hello to those of you in our chat room, the always present fourth guest in our program, chat.orangeloungerator.com, the biggest our chat room has ever been.
232794	233774	Thank you guys so much.
234235	239138	And a big thank you to allgames.com as well, who's simulcasting our live broadcast tonight to a
239638	240718	I played World of Warcraft.
240738	241038	You were there.
241058	243039	And then I signed off to go talk to people.
264355	265356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
285484	290467	and WTF for Work Time Fun, I guess, for the PSP.
290667	291528	That's pretty awesome.
291828	292908	It's a little weird.
293229	294589	A lot of the games are very mundane.
294609	295530	It's just like working.
295710	298071	Like one of them that you put caps on pens.
299412	300213	That's it.
300653	306716	There's another one that's pretty funny, though, where you are a drunken mayor and you have to stumble your way over to a ribbon to cut it.
308397	310518	So you basically earn money to...
312606	313806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
332546	336188	And thank God they leaked it on the internet, because I would not have wanted to buy this game.
336528	338548	It is horrible.
339109	340329	It's short, for one.
340809	344751	I mean, I beat the game under an hour, so that's pretty bad.
345551	354715	The second thing is, the guy behind it, this French guy who does this podcast, I believe it's called, was it Street Smart Cool Cat?
355715	356816	He's a fucking retard.
357558	358478	I fucking hate him.
358679	360899	I hate him even more after playing this game.
361400	362740	He is a complete douche.
362780	372024	He is on, like, the beginning of each level that you play, he's doing something stupid to make himself look really cool, and he's not.
372104	378547	He's like a cross between fucking Bill Nye the Science Guy and Screech, except not smart and nerdier.
379687	383709	Then, I also played, let's see, Transformers, the game on the PSP.
384653	386475	Thank God I'm not buying the PSP one.
387556	389778	Although I will be playing the 360 one later this week.
389978	393361	I just wanted to see what the PSP one looked like, and it's not very good.
394082	397485	But if you only have a PSP, then maybe it's worth picking up.
398528	421754	Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, I actually played some of the single player part of that so that was kind of interesting, pretty good storyline so far of course multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and let's see, off of the PSP, also played Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link still hate that game but I'm still playing it Earth Defense Force 2, I actually tried that on the PlayStation 2
424494	425294	It's interesting.
425334	426595	I don't like the controls too much.
426995	432036	I'm not sure if there's a way to configure it so it's exactly like the Xbox 360, because I think that would really help.
432056	439238	Because right now, the way they have it set up, your look and movement are the same analog sticks, so that kind of sucks.
439558	440558	But otherwise, it looks pretty cool.
440798	442579	You get to destroy Big Ben in the first level.
444952	445853	Let's see, what else?
446113	453841	Oh, I also played, of course, more Earth Defense Force 2017, finished the game on Hard now, and now we're going through Hardest and Inferno.
453861	457624	It's about time you beat that damn game, because I swear, for like the past ten weeks of this program...
464943	465383	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
484830	485670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
514224	518128	Our guild is really growing on there, and it's been a lot of fun.
518528	522713	We have Ventrilo and all that fun stuff, so it's a fun time waster.
523214	525576	Other than that, not a whole lot.
525636	529781	I checked out the new Xbox Live Arcade titled The Band of Bugs game.
529801	530682	Did you check that out at all?
531218	532559	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
558818	559238	So much for that.
560139	565104	However, I did also, I got on the GameTap for some strange reason.
565144	566325	I decided, oh, I'm paying for this.
566365	567807	I should probably check it out again.
567867	569929	And I just started, I had like a marathon the other day.
569949	572011	I was playing all these old school Atari 2600 games.
572331	574954	Like I was playing Kaboom for like an hour and a half.
575114	575835	It was kind of sad.
576491	581915	That's that game, like, you remember on the old school 2600 with the little paddle, except now you use your mouse and you catch the bombs?
582316	583136	Like, I don't know what it is.
583216	585358	Like, some people can sit there and play Bejeweled for hours.
585458	586259	I was playing Kaboom.
586699	589001	And then I played Pitfall, the old school Pitfall.
589401	591323	And I'm a lot better at it now than I was when I was seven.
591363	591743	Go figure.
592790	594631	I actually played through quite a ways in the game.
595171	600512	And I like how GameTap is really taking a lot of good ideas from Xbox Live and incorporating into their service.
600852	604793	Like now you have a profile page that shows the last games that you've played and all that.
605073	605994	Where have I seen this before?
606314	609495	And then you have your leaderboards on the actual service itself.
609735	610935	So, pretty cool.
611375	614776	You know, hey, if it's a good idea, why not borrow it?
615096	617117	I was going to say rip it off, but I guess it would be borrow it.
617477	617597	So...
618437	626959	I do like how GameTap's growing and it'll be interesting when it comes over to the Macs and more people that I know have been holding out on GameTap because it's not out on Mac will be able to come over.
627519	628739	So, that was really it.
628879	631639	Otherwise, a little bit of Puzzle Quest and that was pretty much it.
631659	633520	I didn't play a lot of console games this week, funny enough.
633820	636400	I got Season 1 of Sam & Max.
636480	640441	I haven't installed it yet, though, but I'm planning on playing it.
640881	643141	My computer's kind of on the fritz right now.
643741	646922	Something's going out in it because it randomly shuts off
647492	651775	So I'm thinking either the power supply, hard drive, or motherboard is going out.
651856	653457	Either way, I need to upgrade the damn thing.
653937	654758	It's been like years.
656379	663065	We're going to the chat room, the always present chat.orangeonestradio.com, always the fourth guest, always has been for the past five years, always will be.
663745	665406	We'll start out with this lovely comment tonight.
665466	669870	RossDLUT in chat says, Sky, God, stop sucking GameTac's cock.
671111	671591	You know, I...
673064	674485	You'd think I'm on their payroll or something.
674525	675265	I swear to God I'm not.
675566	678227	I think it's just a pretty good thing.
678427	679648	It's relatively cheap.
679688	680688	You get a lot of games.
680749	681969	It's not a bad deal.
682069	684050	If I like something, I'm going to tell you I like it.
684110	685591	Talk about Xbox Live all the time.
685611	686532	We're not on their payroll.
686672	688213	We're not on anybody's payroll.
689033	692575	I kind of wish I was getting some nookie from all these people.
693336	695337	I want them to hire me to rub them while they're naked.
696738	699380	You want to give a little massage-lovin' to GameTap?
699680	703962	Dude, I would love to go to the video game companies and be their massage therapist.
704442	705543	Would you give out some happy endings?
705583	706744	Would you give Reggie a happy ending?
707264	707504	Rob?
709205	710766	I don't think that's funny in any way.
711186	714768	Oh, and Blackboy in the chatroom says, Loki should buy a new MacBook.
715069	720992	Huh, that's funny, because see, the next computer I'm buying, my benchmark is it's going to be able to run Crysis very well.
721472	725715	So, unfortunately, a MacBook would just, like, explode by...
726755	728993	I don't know, even thinking about running Crysis, so...
729890	730430	No.
730511	730911	Let's see.
730991	734333	What wasn't so negative that was said in chat here that we could also read?
734593	739757	Hitstun says, I like GameTap so far, but I don't have the disk space or clock speed for any of the newer stuff.
740237	740657	Fair enough.
740737	747402	I replaced my computer about a year and a half ago, so it's a little bit newer, so it can run some of these more higher-end stuff.
747902	752105	And some folks who haven't replaced their computer in a few years are probably struggling a little more.
752305	753566	I'm in the process of rebuilding.
753826	757209	Well, not necessarily rebuilding, but I'm adding in stuff to the one that was given to me.
758109	758410	All right.
758710	759030	Very cool.
759417	760298	I redownloaded MAME today, and...
770930	771631	Guitar Freak's Fifth Mix
794977	795237	I don't know.
795357	797478	They also have 3rd Korean on there, which I thought was kind of funny.
797658	799639	They actually have DDR games playable in MAME?
799679	800159	I never knew that.
800259	800419	Yeah.
800439	801020	That's kind of weird.
801400	805021	I don't think they're playable well, like audio problems, but I don't know.
805501	809343	Did you, have they actually enabled the new Capcom board?
809383	811684	I remember last week we reported that like Street Fighter 3 and stuff.
811764	812544	So that's now in there?
813145	814305	Yes, I think so.
814545	815746	I remember seeing some.
817066	817586	Interesting.
817686	821068	I want to see the Sega boards emulated.
821748	823469	Because I want Planet Harrier.
825140	825881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
842560	844501	All right, well, that was our gaming week.
844601	848983	Let's get on to some other stuff before we get into the news, like some housekeeping.
849463	852424	We just wanted to say tonight, of course, you know, it's our fifth anniversary show.
852804	854445	Not a whole lot, you know, I don't know.
854565	860507	I don't know how you guys feel, but I wasn't really all about kind of like tooting our own horns tonight.
860828	861708	So this is more like...
862128	862528	I'm here.
883983	886745	Anyhow, let's get on to the gaming news!
903365	904085	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
928599	930241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
948036	957784	They should rate it AO in America, and it turns out, oh, the game has been rated AO here in America, adults only, which is a rating that's been reserved for very, very few games.
957984	963128	Lots of very under-the-radar type of, like, sex games have gotten this type of rating.
963148	964249	All on PC, by the way.
964309	965029	Yeah, they're all PC.
965069	974617	Well, because, and then the next part of this was, if the game has continued to stay rated AO, the Nintendo will not endorse it, Sony will not endorse it, and Microsoft will not allow it.
974637	974997	Which is fucked up.
975017	976718	They will all not allow the product to come on the systems.
976858	977499	That's fucked up.
978537	982460	Here's the first question I'm going to ask, and maybe somebody's already asked this.
982480	983321	I don't know if you know the answer.
983961	985362	What about a Renegade release?
985803	988365	Because I remember back in the day, remember on Nintendo?
988825	993428	There were companies that would make games without the official Nintendo CO quality, like Color Dreams.
993809	999233	Remember those ugly-ass blue cartridges and the really horrible games that came out from them?
999713	1000654	They could do it.
1002034	1005076	I'm thinking maybe it's because Take-Two is a big, big publisher.
1005096	1006097	They don't want to burn their bridges.
1006177	1017264	Well, not only that, but they could still release everything Renegade or whatever, but I think now that they actually do have to get everything licensed in order to be able to actually press this.
1017284	1022947	That's why everything has to go through certification before it can actually go gold and get disc-pressed on it.
1023127	1025469	So, I don't know.
1025868	1042818	I don't know why they... I wish... The whole thing between AO and Mature is retarded anyways, because what you're saying is this game is not suitable for 17-year-olds, which, I don't know, Hustle 2 out there, it's all about torture and people's limbs getting chopped off and rape and stuff.
1042838	1044099	Naked chicks dancing in blood.
1044299	1052564	And naked chicks dancing in blood, and that's suitable for 17-year-olds, but, oh, a pixelated video game, oh, okay, well that's way...
1053434	1057015	17-year-olds that go, oh, wait, this is teaching me how to commit murder.
1057115	1059056	Okay, I'm going to go murder somebody now.
1059136	1059656	Come on.
1059696	1061497	I mean, seriously, grow the fuck up.
1061957	1065118	And they're all, well, this is to keep it out of our children's hands.
1066439	1068120	It's not supposed to be in children's hands.
1068180	1069620	It's fucking 17 and over.
1070400	1072081	Quick comments from chat room.
1072501	1073001	Let's see.
1073161	1075522	Corey31 says, but no stores will sell it.
1075562	1076503	That's the main problem.
1076723	1080344	Alex Silvara follows up, Walmart, Target, Blockbuster wouldn't sell it.
1080564	1080964	Who cares?
1080984	1082485	That's a selling point for the independents.
1083363	1084925	No, independent stores would carry that shit.
1084965	1089211	In fact, when they heard that it was going to be adults only and that Blockbuster, Gamefly...
1089941	1092683	and Walmart weren't going to be carrying it, they're like, I'll double my order.
1093163	1095465	So that shit would still sell.
1095665	1098247	It may not sell as fast, but it would still sell.
1099027	1100528	Here's a comment from Take-Two.
1101329	1105291	This actually comes from, I'm not sure who at Take-Two.
1105331	1106772	This is a general comment from Take-Two.
1106852	1111455	Quote, the ESRB has issued an initial rating of AO, adults only, for Manhunt 2.
1112176	1114197	Oh, this is an actual statement they made.
1114717	1119780	We believe the process of rating video games is to help people make informed entertainment choices and not to limit them.
1120120	1127523	Manhunt 2 is created for mature audiences, and we strongly believe it should receive an M rating, aligning it with similar content created in other forms of media.
1127823	1131125	We are exploring other options with regards to Manhunt 2.
1131525	1134046	Yeah, and I do think that they're unfairly being targeted.
1134606	1141950	It's always, you know, Take-Two is always the target of, you know, both advocates for, like, you know...
1143092	1143973	and DarkSakura.com
1170470	1171770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1196377	1197378	I'm the wrong person to ask.
1211400	1212180	I could have that too.
1212200	1213481	But it doesn't have the Wii mode.
1213541	1216843	I can't actually pretend I am chopping Wiemers off and whatever.
1216923	1220245	I can slice people across their abdomen in Trauma Center and that's rewarding.
1221326	1221826	Good point.
1221986	1223667	Okay, here's the thing.
1223927	1228209	So it's rated AO for the Wii because you're simulating murder in that.
1228730	1231091	Why is the PlayStation 2 one rated AO as well?
1231747	1232468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1258670	1260111	Afterplay to Black Devil Rx
1284218	1288479	Next can have orifices if you have a tracheotomy or you cut someone's head off.
1288599	1289379	What was the comment?
1290960	1292880	There was a comment about neck rape on there.
1293260	1293900	Oh, interesting.
1294240	1296461	Well, I also want to read another comment from BlackDevilRx.
1296801	1298521	Adults only is a stupid rating.
1298561	1299541	There's no need for it.
1299822	1305763	It should be more like an NC-17 thing because right now they're saying that adults aren't mature, which is the rating below AO, so...
1306741	1307542	Thanks for watching!
1326420	1327281	Thanks for watching!
1344432	1347914	and Hostel or Hostel Part 2, which had a lower rating.
1348294	1349155	It's just a little sex.
1349195	1352457	But then again, that might not be a fair comparison because we're talking about sex versus violence.
1352737	1353557	We're here with Manhunt.
1353597	1354218	It's all violence.
1354618	1361922	Well, it's just like, you know, with a lot of the ratings on these games and stuff, Grand Theft Auto, there's a perfect example.
1361942	1369706	San Andreas, that game had a bunch of murdering and killing of people and stuff, but oh my God, show a little bit of digital boobie and boom, A-O.
1370927	1372688	See, double fucking standards right there.
1372708	1372908	It's...
1374105	1377267	They're just so... I don't even know what the problem is with these people.
1377827	1380569	Okay, granted, it is an adult-only game.
1380829	1384931	And mature, I would think, pretty much satisfies that.
1385252	1391715	Because 17 and older, 18 and older, I think between 17 and 18, for the most part, people aren't maturing that much.
1392236	1397379	I mean, I think at 17, you probably know right and wrong about as much as you do when you're 18.
1397419	1399040	I think the level of the...
1399810	1402854	The dividing line of maturity is when you start paying your own bills.
1403655	1405016	That's actually a really good point.
1405297	1405877	That's a good point.
1406238	1410483	I know a lot of people in their 20s that live with mommy and daddy that aren't as mature as some people I know that moved out at 17.
1410563	1415689	I don't understand why they don't just have M as the cap off for that, you know, or...
1416624	1417565	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1435045	1463335	and I think to an extent that's what they kind of tried to do with the ESRB is I think they tried to copy the movie ratings without copying them so I think like an M rating is supposed to be like R no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian and same thing they would sell you a game as long as your mommy or daddy is there with you and the clerk says what's in the game but AO is like NC-17 no one under 17 admitted period parents or not this is just not an acceptable thing
1463994	1466935	So, you know, and that would be, I think, the thing with the AO rating.
1466955	1469415	You know, this game has not sold to anyone over 80.
1469736	1470536	It's like cigarettes.
1470616	1471876	You do not sell it under any circumstance.
1471896	1473937	It's just like, you know, the M-rated games.
1474237	1477157	Those are not intended to be played by kids that are under 17.
1478798	1483079	And so it is, in a sense, like the, you know, NC-17.
1483499	1485460	It's just people don't treat it that way.
1485500	1489741	And then until someone goes and murders somebody, then they're all, oh, my God, it was the game's fault.
1489901	1490821	I had no idea.
1490841	1490921	Yeah.
1492455	1493917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1510113	1511174	Some interesting stuff.
1511615	1520603	This has kind of been a trend with Microsoft right now, securing a lot of exclusive rights to things, one of which being Grand Theft Auto 4 episodic content.
1521003	1533174	Apparently, they've spent $50 million in securing this episodic content, which to me, that seems like an awful lot of money to spend to secure content for a game that's downloadable.
1534094	1535656	I would be very interested if...
1537406	1539486	There are some announcements at E3 or something.
1539686	1547728	I was thinking that maybe they're going to announce that it's going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive for the game because that's quite a bit of money that they're throwing at them.
1547828	1549168	But whatever, either way.
1550928	1562110	So yeah, so if you own the 360, you're going to be able to download, I guess, the episodic content in about two batches, one of which is supposed to hit mid-next year and then the rest at the end of next year.
1562931	1563871	So $25 million for each.
1566440	1567561	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1586656	1592281	Let's say they sell 5 million copies of the game, at least, on Xbox 360.
1592581	1595804	They sell 5 million copies of the game, and people are going to download this.
1595824	1598867	Let's say they charge $10 for the episodic content.
1599127	1600909	They're going to make their $50 million back right there.
1601029	1607374	Now, granted, I'm assuming that everybody's going to buy it, which isn't going to happen, but I'm only considering one piece of downloadable content for $10.
1608135	1612579	If they release three pieces of downloadable content for $10, they'll more than make their money back, and then some.
1613143	1617767	Plus, they have something that Sony doesn't, which in the end might move some consoles and so on and so on.
1617787	1620148	Because I know people that are holding out for this game.
1620248	1625893	Plus, gamer picks and themes and all sorts of crap that they can market using Grand Theft Auto.
1628415	1628895	There you go.
1631397	1631957	And you know what?
1632017	1635500	To be honest, I'm not too surprised that they're actually doing this.
1635560	1641885	Because the PlayStation Network so far, downloadable content for games has been almost non-existent.
1642789	1654659	So now just to clear this up, because I'm still a little unsure on this, because I seem to remember when this game was first announced, they said, okay, the PlayStation 3 is going to have this downloadable content, and the Xbox 360 will have this different downloadable content.
1655000	1660444	Microsoft is basically paid to stop the PlayStation 3 exclusive content from coming out at all.
1660825	1661265	I think so.
1662026	1662406	Interesting.
1664233	1671579	I guess that's why they did it, to try and move some more systems and get people, because the game will be that much more on the 360.
1672740	1675503	Well, this isn't the first game that they were doing this.
1675523	1680707	In fact, now they're saying that Beautiful Katamari is going to be a 360 exclusive as well.
1681167	1681808	Who knows about that?
1682629	1684430	GS191 says something interesting.
1684470	1687613	The three items for download, a gun, a car, and a sex minigame.
1688976	1690838	It's not going to be stupid shit like that.
1690898	1695662	It's going to be actual episodic, brand new storylines and stuff like that.
1695762	1697723	Not like you get a brand new gun.
1698744	1702907	Blackboy says Take-Two is actually talking about selling 10 million units by the end of 2008.
1704141	1704381	We shall see.
1724693	1741145	Well, speaking of downloadable content, Eidos UK has said that the Tomb Raider Anniversary for Xbox 360 is, well, going to be available as a series of downloads in conjunction with Tomb Raider Legend.
1742446	1754314	So, basically, you're downloading each of them as different, I guess, different parts of the game, with free downloads being available
1754767	1757049	Laura's Manor, all that type of stuff.
1757890	1762935	However, each of these episodes are going to be about $30 a piece, 2,400 Microsoft points.
1763575	1768560	I wouldn't suppose there will be a downloadable topless Laura patch like there was on the PC versions.
1769400	1769541	No.
1770281	1771422	That's most unfortunate.
1773424	1775466	They're saying that the first two are going to be available in September.
1776287	1776407	Wow.
1776877	1779638	I don't know though, I kind of don't care about Tomb Raider anymore.
1779678	1787160	Like I played that Tomb Raider game on 360, didn't really, like the full, I don't even remember what it was called, the retail release that came out a few months ago, didn't really dig it.
1787340	1789060	I'm kind of over Lara Croft.
1789420	1796182	Yeah, I haven't really cared about her since you could throw her off the balcony in Tomb Raider 2 and break her neck and do the exploding code.
1796422	1797603	It was kind of fun to kill her off.
1797843	1800363	And lock her up, butler in the lock-in freezer.
1801204	1801804	The lock-in freezer.
1802084	1802904	Could you really do that?
1803064	1803444	Yes, you could.
1803464	1805325	That's the only way you could keep them from following you.
1805345	1806225	All right.
1807072	1808594	and DarkSakura.com.
1832574	1838259	A Donkey Kong Bongo Blast and Tarou Jet Race is coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 28th.
1838319	1842243	I believe that is the bongoless bongo game because you have the Wiimotes.
1843322	1843522	Baroque
1862181	1867342	from Sting, a special edition of Devil May Cry 3, but that's just a price reduction, really.
1868323	1872263	Also, an earlier version of Dragon Quest goes into the Ultimate Hits Collection.
1872303	1874904	I believe this is one of the side quest stories.
1875424	1887687	Actually, a special edition thing for Devil May Cry 3, I believe is the one that they released over here, where it was the greatest hits, but they also added an additional playable character and additional difficulties.
1888499	1892081	This is a reduction for a Dragon Quest VIII spinoff story that was on the PlayStation 2.
1892322	1893682	And I don't remember this game being here.
1894183	1895524	I don't know if they ever ported this over here.
1895564	1898586	Perhaps somebody else in our chatroom knows a little more about that game.
1898706	1899926	No, I don't think that game ever came out here.
1899946	1903128	Because that's because the game is way bigger over in Japan.
1903549	1907571	Also coming out, Metal Slug on the PlayStation 2.
1907711	1908612	Yes.
1908652	1909533	Moving into the best hits.
1909573	1909753	What?
1909793	1910013	What?
1910173	1910513	What?
1911494	1911934	What?
1914496	1915597	I love Metal Slug.
1915737	1916257	I'll kill you.
1918129	1918589	Let's see.
1918849	1925391	Also coming out on June 28th in Japan, Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra.
1925531	1925811	What?
1926531	1927151	Excuse me.
1927371	1927631	What?
1928591	1933032	Why do they keep putting out games for that anime that's been, what, 10 years gone now?
1933092	1934113	Because people buy them.
1934133	1935233	The ones on Saturn sucked.
1936253	1938254	The one on Nintendo 64 sucked.
1938794	1939814	Why do they keep doing it?
1940382	1941983	Tales of Fandom Vol.
1942444	1946367	2 coming out from Namco Bandai on June 28th, also on the PlayStation 2.
1946767	1951631	Taito Memories, also known as Eternal Hits, coming out in two versions.
1951711	1953352	That's Gekkan and Jukkan.
1953632	1959837	And I believe that's very similar to what we have over here is the Taito Greatest Hits Collection, the comparable thing we have here already in America.
1960653	1961654	also coming out in Japan.
1961694	1965757	The King of Fighters 11 moving into the Best Hits collection on the 28th.
1965917	1968719	SNK is moving a lot of stuff into Best Hits on PlayStation 2.
1969960	1972322	We're quickly checking the handheld systems.
1973062	1976185	Kurikuri DS is coming out on June 28th.
1976525	1977706	Otasuke Island.
1978246	1981528	This looks like one of those cute little chibi games.
1981909	1982990	I don't know, it's an action game.
1983790	1984611	Looks like with bunnies.
1985131	1987113	And an angry pink bunny sailing a ship.
1987193	1987413	That's...
1988390	1989050	Otona no Joryoku Kentai
2015695	2017296	Lots of releases here on June 28th.
2017436	2021458	Ratchet & Clank gets its BSP release on June 28th.
2022019	2030083	And just for Jamie, Secret of Evangelion Portable coming out on the 28th.
2031784	2032144	That's it.
2035266	2038248	I wish it was all Neon Genesis over here, too.
2038268	2038828	That'd be funny.
2040011	2040451	But it's not.
2041092	2043733	So, anyways, next week there's a ton of releases.
2043993	2046354	A lot of them coming out based on movies.
2046995	2049336	One of which is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
2049756	2051657	That's going to be coming out on almost everything.
2051857	2057960	PlayStation 2, PSP, 360, PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
2058020	2060301	PSP and I believe DS also.
2062082	2064343	Then, of course, Ratatouille.
2064463	2066064	That's going to be coming out on almost everything.
2066204	2067505	PlayStation 2, GameCube.
2068474	2072177	PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii, DS, and PSP.
2074840	2080904	Now, Transformers, that's going to be coming out on all the console systems, so that'll be pretty cool.
2081905	2088090	And then on the Wii, we've got Pokemon Battle Revolution, so that's pretty slick.
2088991	2097338	The Biggs is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PlayStation 3, and 360, kind of like an arcade-style baseball game.
2098281	2100583	Grim Grimoire is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.
2101143	2102284	That one's supposed to be pretty good.
2103485	2110109	Also, PSP, just this small little game called Final Fantasy is going to be coming out as well.
2110870	2112311	What's that game about?
2112351	2113051	I've never heard of it.
2113432	2116674	I don't know, but I hear it's kind of a Japanese-style game.
2116834	2117634	Oh, then never mind.
2117855	2119636	I don't know if I'll be playing that.
2120276	2123939	Then, of course, this is actually something I'm interested in, TraxPad.
2124039	2127001	It's kind of a portable...
2128260	2129561	Music Studio type thing.
2129641	2131142	So I'm going to be picking that up.
2131323	2132424	Maybe make some music with that.
2133765	2137648	And then on 360 also we had Hour of Victory coming out.
2137828	2139769	Overlord is making its way out here.
2140410	2144613	And on PlayStation 3, hopefully, Rainbow Six Vegas.
2145294	2148537	Because that thing's been delayed so many freaking times.
2150498	2151339	And I believe that's it.
2152276	2153157	I have some stuff.
2153677	2154057	All right.
2154698	2155939	Whose release dates do you have?
2156019	2157620	These are UK release dates.
2158020	2163023	On the 26th, we have Cosmic Family for Wii and Harry Potter and the Odor of Phoenix.
2163724	2164124	Sorry, Odor.
2164144	2164344	Odor.
2165865	2167587	And then a bunch of crap on the 29th.
2167687	2171749	We have Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars on PSP.
2172230	2173190	I love Crazy Taxi.
2173711	2174872	Crazy Taxi.
2175192	2179515	Driver Parallel Lines, Final Fantasy VI Advance, which I already have in my purse.
2180503	2189527	Hour of Victory, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition, More Brain Training from Dr. Kalashima, How Old is Your Brain, Project Silphid, I want Project Silphid!
2189867	2190087	Sorry.
2190747	2191488	A few more weeks.
2191888	2193629	A few more weeks.
2194429	2195509	No, you have no idea.
2195770	2198571	I played the shit out of Silphid on the Sega CD.
2198651	2199771	Second week in July.
2200592	2203613	When I saw the thing for Project Silphid, I about...
2204349	2207491	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2230865	2232547	Sounds like a bad fanfiction.
2233467	2235669	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter 2.
2236470	2238251	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Vegas.
2239653	2239893	Yeah.
2240293	2241214	Vampire Reign.
2243116	2244757	Agon, Lost Swords of Toledo.
2244917	2245678	Is that like Ohio?
2246338	2246979	Is this Toledo?
2247539	2248280	Is that Ohio?
2249401	2251603	Okay, we're going to Ohio to look for the sword.
2252143	2254886	And Eye of Shit, I mean Eye of Judgment.
2256127	2257008	Wait, Eye of Judgment?
2257188	2257968	Wait, no, no, no.
2258028	2258429	PlayStation 3.
2259536	2260157	and Steel Horizons.
2267550	2270833	I was going to say, there's a few that I missed for the US.
2270893	2274755	Darkness, which isn't just a fan fiction, I hope you know.
2275216	2277978	It's actually a Top Cow comic, I believe.
2278618	2280580	I thought it was published by Image as well.
2280880	2288405	Being made into a live action movie as well, it's kind of like a cross between demonic possession and a mafia story type thing.
2288445	2290326	You basically rip people apart with demons.
2291627	2291807	And...
2292864	2293364	What was the other one?
2293444	2295185	Oh, Driver Parallel Lines for the Wii.
2295305	2297786	But, you know, you probably don't want to pick that one up anyways, so.
2298606	2299346	Darkness.
2301607	2304568	Isn't that a cliche thing to call your game or whatever?
2304688	2305208	Darkness?
2305348	2305668	I don't know.
2305808	2307649	But that's the name of the comic book series.
2307869	2308209	Ah, fine.
2308229	2308829	The Darkness.
2309049	2310090	Fine.
2310310	2312370	It's the demonic thing that possessed him.
2312390	2314891	All right, anything else, DarkSakura for our UK listeners?
2315171	2315852	Your mom.
2316372	2316692	Really?
2316832	2318332	What platform is she coming out on?
2318532	2319673	The Last Night platform.
2319693	2320013	All right.
2320720	2322481	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2344634	2348275	Now you'll notice that the Wii, now people don't really know what this is.
2348315	2353537	If this is like a typo, if they just meant to put Dr. Mario and they put like the Wii or whatever is in there.
2353797	2356238	Or if this is actually like a whole new game.
2357199	2358839	Hmm, wouldn't that be something?
2358919	2361740	A whole new game based on Dr. Mario.
2362381	2363501	That sounds like fun to me.
2363561	2371424	I would be really impressed if it were SNK, but unfortunately... I don't think it would be, seeing as Dr. Mario is a Nintendo license.
2372734	2374635	No, I'm talking about the whole new game part.
2374995	2375375	Alright.
2376796	2379657	Alright, well that's pretty much it, so be on the lookout for that.
2379717	2382458	And hopefully that Dr. Mario Wii thing is a new thing.
2382498	2388821	You know, in my mind, if that is something new, that would be the perfect thing to release the week of E3.
2389441	2389961	Mark my words.
2390661	2391782	Dr. Mario Wii.
2392421	2393121	It's a start.
2393341	2398323	It's not, you know, probably a game that a lot of us are going to get super-duper excited about, but it's a start.
2398423	2400044	It's something we don't have yet.
2400384	2400824	You know what I mean?
2400864	2403505	It's something new being made for the Wii, if that makes any sense.
2404586	2406526	It's better than Everybody Votes Channel, okay?
2406586	2407327	Let's just leave it at that.
2408567	2410208	Everybody Votes Channel!
2411788	2413729	Everybody votes to change this channel.
2414109	2415610	I fucking hate that channel, by the way.
2416110	2417951	Just, you know, completely useless.
2419131	2419431	Anyways.
2419451	2420072	So...
2421613	2424595	Interesting rumor, kind of also associated with Nintendo here.
2425696	2434321	That would be that they will be licensing their properties to be made into games onto the Apple iPhone.
2437843	2446148	I don't know if anyone remembers that back in the day there was a certain platform which they licensed their games to be made onto.
2448910	2451291	Yeah, CDI games didn't turn out very well.
2452369	2458095	But apparently they're supposed to be coming out on the iPhone priced at about $29 each.
2458535	2466783	So is $29 worth paying for a downloadable game that's going to be probably a remake of Mario Bros.?
2467984	2468384	I don't know.
2468645	2469866	Sounds more like a rumor to me.
2471016	2474438	Okay, the most interesting thing about this story, like I could kind of care less about the game.
2474678	2480400	I personally am not interested in the iPhone, but I have a lot of friends who are like doing the campout thing and all that crap to get this stupid phone.
2481280	2483521	Not my thing, but I don't have $600 to burn.
2484322	2486142	But for those that want it, hey, good for you.
2486222	2486883	Can I have a loan?
2487603	2492545	But the point behind this story, Yuri Lover in chat sums it up perfectly.
2492705	2494646	OMG, Nintendo and Apple are in bed together.
2495446	2498927	This is what the fanboys wanted years ago.
2499247	2502588	They kept saying, gee, Nintendo likes to put cute things out.
2502988	2505848	Apple likes to put cute things out in different colors, just like Nintendo.
2506108	2507669	Why aren't these companies in bed together?
2508189	2509449	And here they go.
2509829	2512770	There's a little foreplay going on here with this story, right?
2513770	2514530	Is this foreplay?
2514970	2516710	I think it's just a rumor, to be honest.
2517310	2518591	You think this is just bullshit?
2518611	2519891	I think this is bullshit, but...
2520796	2523458	You know, it wouldn't surprise me that they're going to try to whore themselves out.
2523578	2530763	And it wouldn't surprise me that stupid morons that pay $600 for a fucking phone would pay $30 for downloadable content on said phone.
2531523	2533224	Geniuses that buy this shit.
2533404	2534885	So, way to go.
2535566	2536006	You know what?
2536066	2540729	Maybe you should go purchase a PlayStation 3 while you're at it since you have all this excess money to throw around.
2542330	2543431	Are you just mad because you're poor?
2543971	2545632	No, I don't want this fucking phone.
2545792	2547093	I would not pay $600 for a goddamn phone.
2548800	2554563	So anyway, for anyone who is one of our friends in the UK, they just got a big treat on the virtual console.
2555363	2555943	Guess what's out?
2556964	2557984	Mega Man!
2558104	2558844	Your mom, oh.
2559205	2561566	No, my mom doesn't put out for anything.
2561586	2562126	Mega Mom.
2563547	2570970	Mega Man just made it out for 500 Wii points, and from TurboGrafx-16, China Warriors is another new one on there.
2571250	2572771	They are both games from 1989.
2572811	2572871	But...
2577245	2581867	Dude, I'm just excited about Mega Man because, you know, all the Mega Man 2, though, was really the better game.
2581887	2583068	Mega Man, though, was really cool.
2584348	2585649	It's one of the ones that has beaten.
2585669	2592992	I like Mega Man and all, but what about, you know, the whole Mega Man collection that was on GameCube and the Wii's backwards compatible, you know?
2593012	2593512	Do people care?
2593792	2594213	Yeah, me.
2594633	2597574	I'm not going to spend money on the virtual console Mega Man when that game's out there.
2597634	2600375	Well, neither am I. I mean, I have the freaking cartridge.
2600475	2602996	By the way, I can't lend you one of my Nintendos, but that's another story.
2605618	2606518	But, you know...
2607600	2612822	But for people who may not have bought the collection or may just say, oh, well, that's pretty cool, Mega Man.
2612862	2614042	They might want to get it.
2614282	2617203	So in other words, for lazy people who are one-click shoppers.
2617743	2617923	Yeah.
2618123	2618363	All right.
2618403	2618743	There you go.
2618803	2619203	Very good.
2619603	2619864	Very good.
2619884	2620464	Then carry on.
2620664	2621744	And talk to me later about the Nintendo.
2621984	2622704	Carry on.
2622724	2623485	Did you say you can?
2623505	2624705	I have like three.
2624745	2625305	You can borrow one.
2625405	2625705	Sweet.
2625725	2626665	I thought you said you can't.
2626946	2627026	No.
2627046	2627666	I was like, oh, okay.
2627806	2628146	Yes, ma'am.
2628526	2629406	You can borrow one of our older ones.
2629486	2629946	Swell.
2630286	2632347	I'm totally going to get a copy of Guardian Legend for myself.
2632667	2633687	You can borrow mine, too, if you want.
2634408	2634948	Awesomeness.
2634968	2635588	I'm not playing it.
2636469	2638611	If I can only tear myself away from World of Warcraft.
2638632	2645779	There are free, easier methods to obtain Guardian Legends to play it on a console.
2645819	2646840	It's not the same.
2647180	2647961	It's not the same.
2648041	2648782	I can't explain it.
2648862	2649523	It's not the same.
2649583	2651084	Those little imperfections bug me.
2651865	2657290	There's something rewarding about blowing on the cartridge and putting it in the machine and it'll finally work at some point.
2657311	2658552	I don't know.
2658572	2659693	There's something rewarding about that.
2660578	2669826	Hopefully there's a lot of rewards from this game as well, or else there's going to be a lot of people that are pissed off because Spore, which you might remember was my favorite game I saw at last year's E3.
2670146	2678052	Well, I'm going to be waiting a long freaking time to play this game, as are all of you, because this game has been pushed back to the fiscal year 2009.
2680354	2684618	That means that it will, at earliest, come out in April of 2008.
2686379	2690022	Now, some folks were, you know, this game was already supposed to be out.
2690905	2692505	Then it got pushed back to this fiscal year.
2692866	2694286	Then it got pushed back to next fiscal year.
2694326	2696306	Then it was like, oh, it's going to come out by the Christmas.
2696747	2697967	Oh, it's going to come out first quarter 2008.
2698727	2699607	Here we go again.
2699647	2704069	It just got delayed to April 2008 at the earliest.
2704589	2709710	And it's so weird because when we saw the demo, I was like, this game looks like it's almost done.
2710390	2711330	The game looks great.
2711390	2715171	I mean, maybe that's why they only showed us one element of the game.
2715211	2716352	Maybe looks can be deceiving.
2716832	2717032	But
2717793	2718213	I don't know.
2718693	2721176	It's just that it's a massive game and they want to make sure they get it right.
2721436	2721777	That's all.
2722057	2722938	For a change!
2723078	2723458	Yay!
2724940	2728163	Gerardimo calls this game in our chatroom Spore Forever.
2728664	2730105	A little play on Duke Nukem Forever.
2730186	2730446	Get it?
2731149	2747126	Yeah, but at least we've actually seen screenshots and like, you know, playable sport, like, you know, because they show, I mean, even though you weren't able to play the demo yourself, they did kind of like a, you know, a user-assisted tutorial type thing at E3 and it looked pretty awesome.
2747246	2751931	I mean, it was awesome enough to get me the most excited over any other game I saw at E3 last year.
2751951	2752912	It looked awesome.
2753843	2756966	But nevertheless, I am pissed off about the fact that this game is delayed.
2757006	2764672	I don't know how Loki and DarkSakura feel, but since I'm at the soundboard and I'm angry enough, I push the button and out come the FUs.
2775441	2776722	DarkSakura, start us off.
2777963	2778603	FU to life.
2780345	2781146	I'm sorry to hear that.
2781786	2782026	That's it?
2782046	2782186	Okay.
2783191	2783331	Yeah.
2784151	2786752	But that's a good blanket FU to kind of encompass everything.
2787332	2789913	Oh yeah, because there's a whole bunch of shit going on, so FU to all of it.
2790393	2790913	Sorry to hear that.
2791013	2791293	Loki.
2793374	2798595	Once again, I would like to repeat my distaste for Street Smart Cool Cat.
2798815	2806097	That fucking idiot can die in a fire, and I hope your game sucks balls and does not sell one piece.
2806537	2809098	It is horrible, and you need to stop.
2811187	2819857	I would like to say F you to Bobby Blackwolf for correcting me in chat saying Duke Nukem Forever was playable at E3 1998 on the Quake 2 engine.
2821619	2822259	F you, Bobby.
2823341	2825884	And your old show, 100 Weeks, whatever.
2826464	2826524	Uh...
2827702	2828683	Just kidding, I heart Bobby.
2829323	2834606	I also want to say a big F you to the DMV.
2835026	2837688	Because I have to go there tomorrow and nobody likes going to the DMV.
2837908	2844651	Because I have to get my license renewed because my birthday is coming up and I got to get that all taken care of before my birthday or else I won't have a driver's license.
2844832	2846833	F you to the possibility I may not have a driver's license.
2850595	2850895	That's it.
2851656	2861441	Anyways, so there's something actually pretty cool coming out of the homebrew scene, and that is a sequel, a homebrew sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.
2862162	2863382	And it actually looks pretty cool.
2863702	2876969	The name of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog XG, or Extended Genesis, and pretty much captures the original Sonic the Hedgehog game series very accurately.
2877029	2878290	It's scheduled to have
2878920	2908244	10 unique zones, 18 acts along with his secret zone after Chaos Central and no word though on what it's coming out on I would assume PC but pretty awesome they have a video on Destructoid if you want to check it out really cool looking game I'm not really a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog series so hopefully it gets released and you can download it before Sega's lawyers get on them that would be nice
2908891	2916814	Well, other Sonic news that I think is actually kind of cool is Bioware is doing a Sonic RPG that's going to be on the Nintendo DS.
2917214	2918815	It's supposed to be out in 2008.
2919495	2929680	There's not a whole bunch out on it, but it's just saying that Sega is standing behind what Bioware has planned doing and Bioware wants to do it, blah, blah, blah.
2930080	2931260	So, I hope it's good.
2931820	2932181	It could be.
2932981	2937603	You know, they did good stuff for... Didn't they do Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic?
2937703	2937843	So...
2940440	2945244	and the upcoming Mass Effect game, which is going to be like one of the best role-playing games for the 360.
2945524	2945984	You hope.
2946765	2949146	It looks... It does look pretty freaking amazing.
2949166	2949486	Amazing.
2951788	2956031	Every time I hear about this, I think about the Mario RPG for some sick reason.
2956071	2969260	I mean, because, you know, Squeenix helped make, well, it was just Square back then, but Squaresoft made the, you know, Mario RPG game and that was like a top-of-the-line developer, especially back at that time at the, you know, I remember Final Fantasy was like all the rage at that point, you know.
2969670	2976012	Just kind of interesting that now you have this Bioware who's kind of like, you know, also an A-list developer kind of making this Sonic RPG.
2976392	2980274	I just hope it doesn't blow chunks like all the other Sonic games that have come out in the past three years.
2982035	2982755	My thoughts exactly.
2983115	2989217	That makes me also pissed off because remember there was, I think, Square Enix was saying that they wanted to dedicate themselves to the Nintendo platforms.
2989517	2991838	Make me another goddamn Super Mario RPG!
2992138	2996700	Since you've dedicated yourself to the Nintendo platforms, why don't you make yourself useful?
2997546	3000530	Do that instead of making another fucking sequel to Final Fantasy 7.
3002572	3005775	It's a BlackDevilerX in chat says, Sega and Bioware are in bed.
3006616	3008198	We have a lot of in bed stories tonight.
3008218	3008799	What's up with that?
3009419	3009860	Go figure.
3010438	3010978	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3035430	3036050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3060633	3063655	says, quote, there seems to be some misinformation flying around.
3064036	3071641	Nothing's changed since our call on May 8th, where John Riccatello specifically said that we were removing Spore from fiscal 08 to early fiscal 09.
3073482	3076524	So maybe that Spore thing wasn't news after all.
3076544	3077445	But I'm still angsty about it.
3077465	3078405	That's a long time to wait.
3078826	3081027	I actually still was thinking it was coming out Christmas this year.
3081067	3082588	I somehow missed the boat on that story.
3083009	3083449	Go figure.
3084127	3085588	But nevertheless, thanks for the corrections.
3085829	3090633	We report on what's big on the gaming blogs out there and what catches our eye.
3091254	3093936	And we're not always going to be 100% on target.
3094577	3095337	But we try to get close.
3095898	3099021	Hopefully this is accurate because this is something trying to foresee things a little bit.
3099381	3105607	This would be the list of Halo 3 achievements coming to you thanks to Xbox360achievements.org.
3105947	3110031	So for those of you that are achievement point whores, Loki, bye in the game.
3110782	3112703	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3140536	3145273	Also, some hidden skulls looking like they claim some different achievements throughout the game.
3145720	3149282	and then of course there's some various player versus player achievements.
3149943	3155987	Awards being given for triple kill, overkill, headshots and then some achievements.
3156287	3157388	Headshots are the best.
3157528	3171838	Some achievements still in question because you actually see the achievement says score over X amount of points in the campaign made a game on the second mission for some various achievements named such thing as Demon, Gorilla, Vanguard, Reclaimer.
3172298	3175360	So it looks like about nine different achievements there so kind of interesting.
3176127	3179048	So that's what the achievements look like for Halo 3.
3180288	3183590	Someone was asking me in chat room what my favorite all-time first-person shooter is.
3184170	3185070	TimeSplitters 2.
3186431	3187611	Fucking awesome game.
3188631	3191612	Anyways, let's see here.
3192293	3198415	So, there's some interesting developments in the whole immersion thing.
3198435	3204197	Remember back, immersion, of course, sued Sony over the rumble technology in their controllers.
3205362	3207784	Well, now we've got Microsoft suing Immersion.
3208344	3220714	And the reason is, is because apparently because of the whole Sony lawsuit, and since they settled on that, that violates some sort of agreement that Microsoft had with Immersion when they were licensing the technology.
3221094	3224197	And according to Microsoft, Microsoft licenses technology in both
3224597	3224877	Poor babies.
3224957	3225037	Aww.
3254409	3255570	Let's pout and sue.
3255830	3260972	What exactly... Somebody remind me, because I haven't really been following the details of all these stories.
3260992	3263473	You know, I just see the headlines and I go, oh, lawsuit, lawsuit.
3263813	3265854	What exactly has Immersion done for gaming?
3266894	3269095	They developed, apparently, Rumble technology.
3269335	3272217	Apparently, they developed Rumble technology.
3272237	3279460	Well, they have trademarks, so... But was it one of those things where, like... Because I remember, did they develop the first... What is it?
3279520	3282161	The Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak was the first thing that had Rumble, right?
3282181	3282261	Yeah.
3283132	3283933	Yeah, I think so.
3284253	3285034	Did they develop that?
3285514	3286675	No.
3287316	3294042	It's one of those companies that makes a patent or patents something and then sits on it until someone makes it and then they go and sue them.
3295303	3295784	Interesting.
3297085	3301649	Because I'm like, what exactly has a merchant done besides sue people and get sued?
3302430	3303571	Like, have they ever made a game?
3303711	3305213	Have they ever made a third-party product?
3305873	3306113	Nothing.
3306914	3307415	Interesting.
3308115	3308396	So...
3309315	3312356	DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?
3337850	3342953	Today's website of the week is one that should be nearing dear to the hearts of anyone who has ever gotten married.
3344455	3346436	It's UglyDress.com.
3347396	3352780	It shows the worst bridesmaids' dresses ever with photographs.
3353821	3354942	And these are really awful.
3356202	3360866	There's one on here that looks like a flag.
3362287	3364208	And I'm not even joking, it's really nasty.
3366178	3375340	and there's, it's not just weddings either, it's, it's like ugly cakes and, uh, like ugly shoes and tuxedos and shit.
3375420	3378661	It's really just awful, awful stuff.
3379021	3387563	There's some show that they all watch on Ventrilo in World of Warcraft, the guild, and it's something, it's very similar to what you're talking about.
3387603	3388503	It's, it's like, um,
3389431	3389811	DarkSakura.com
3414245	3418447	It picks up, so we just hear this random laughing, and we're like, what the hell is so goddamn funny?
3418807	3424609	And she says, oh, I'm watching this show that's like some type of like, I don't know what it is, emergency makeover show.
3427030	3429531	Damn, I shouldn't have opened my mouth unless I could think of the name of the show.
3429571	3433873	I guess I was kind of hoping that somebody in chat would know what it's about.
3436229	3440334	Anyway, I looked up Immersion Corporation, by the way, on Wikipedia.
3440974	3445700	BlackWolf in chat came to save the day, because BlackWolf knows more about gaming than I do, apparently.
3446440	3448943	BlackWolf said, And I'm looking at Wikipedia here.
3454875	3458716	Immersion Corporation of San Jose, California is a developer of Haptic Technology.
3459036	3459936	The company was founded in 1993.
3460336	3469338	Immersion's technology is employed in automotive, entertainment, medical training, mobility, personal computing, and three-dimensional simulation applications.
3469838	3474158	Immersion's patent portfolio includes over 500 issues or pending patents in the U.S.
3474218	3474918	and other countries.
3475439	3480319	Immersion was used as an example in an article on patent trolls by Game Daily Biz.
3480719	3483220	So I guess we're not the first people to say something about that.
3484212	3485553	Kudos to Game Daily Biz.
3485893	3487694	I'm glad they have something called Patent Trolls.
3487734	3488355	That's kind of funny.
3488615	3490336	Thank you, WonderDog, Harold, and Chat.
3490396	3492677	It's called What Not to Wear is the name of the show.
3492998	3493978	It's called What Not to Wear.
3494158	3495759	So you should check out that show, DarkSakura.
3495799	3496640	Isn't that on TV?
3496660	3497701	That requires watching television.
3497741	3498861	Isn't that on style?
3498901	3499402	Use a torrent.
3499522	3499822	I don't know.
3500302	3501503	That's on Style Network.
3501683	3502183	I think so.
3502263	3502924	Why do I know this?
3502944	3503844	I don't even have that.
3503864	3505465	Because your wife probably watches it.
3506926	3509128	It totally sounds like something your wife probably watches.
3509808	3510068	All right.
3510809	3511069	Anyhow.
3513335	3517641	Just trying to get caught up on some other chatroom comments here.
3519885	3526134	Saikun says, stop using us, Rob, because I guess I'm using the chatroom to do research tonight.
3528055	3529715	Video Game Addiction could possibly be a new diagnosis.
3555522	3558623	This is somewhat a bit of a follow-up to the article we were talking about last week.
3559264	3574611	The AMA is going to be having this meeting, and it already started in Chicago, and the council is going to be asking the group to lobby for the disorder to be included in a widely used mental illness manual created and published by the American Psychiatric Association, Video Game Addiction.
3574971	3580173	Now, if this were actually happening, this could mean that possibly your insurance company
3580413	3584234	would cover this as any other type of mental disorder like alcoholism.
3610579	3612619	Don't ask me how I know so much about insurance, but I do.
3613180	3619261	Insurance companies don't cover marijuana because it's not a federally recognized drug.
3619641	3621201	It's only recognized in certain states.
3621541	3624482	So your insurance company typically won't cover marijuana.
3624842	3626362	But you can get a prescription for it.
3626402	3627722	You can, in certain states.
3627882	3630803	Yes, and there's only certain farms that are allowed to grow it.
3630903	3634523	I'm sorry, how did we get from video game diagnosis story to pot growing?
3634883	3637144	Because we give our listeners what they want to know.
3637284	3637564	I see.
3639139	3642182	Anyway, from the story here, I want to point this out.
3642342	3648287	Joyce Protopapas of Frisco, Texas said her 17-year-old son, Michael, was a video game addict.
3648327	3649928	Actually, the story says a video addict.
3650568	3663299	Over nearly two years, video and internet games transformed him from an outgoing, academically gifted team into a reclusive manipulator who flunked two 10th grade classes and spent several hours a day and night playing a popular online video game called World of Warcraft.
3664013	3668537	My father was an alcoholic and I saw exactly the same thing in Michael, said Protopappas.
3668977	3671139	We battled him until October of last year.
3671459	3672400	We went to therapists.
3672440	3673701	We tried taking the game away.
3674021	3675182	He would threaten us physically.
3675262	3677284	He would curse and call us every name imaginable.
3677344	3678625	It was as if he was possessed.
3679295	3683418	and when she suggested the therapist that Michael had a video game addiction nobody was familiar with it.
3683458	3684318	They all poo-pooed it.
3685019	3693625	And finally they found a therapist and they sent Michael to a therapeutic boarding school $5,000 a month that the insurance didn't cover to get him kicked off the video games.
3693865	3696967	You know what my mom would have done if I flunked a class over video games?
3697367	3706353	She would have like thrown the TV out a window or she would have taken she actually did this once she took the power cord to the Nintendo so I couldn't hook it up to the TV for like
3707205	3709106	I'm powerless to do anything about these video games
3735191	3737152	Fucking bullshit is what it is.
3737452	3741975	She needs to get off her fucking drunken ass and take care of her damn kids is what she needs to do.
3742595	3744136	But, um, I don't know.
3744216	3747398	I think it's stupid that she couldn't just take away the game system.
3747438	3748818	I mean, he's a 14-year-old.
3749239	3750559	Beat the crap out of him.
3750579	3751560	I mean, it's easy.
3753781	3759704	If she can't do it... I don't know if I would go that far, but... She should put him in one of those deprivation tanks.
3759764	3764647	It sounds like he had a lot of problems besides just video games and maybe he should have gone to the boarding school already.
3765219	3765899	That's a good idea.
3766460	3767880	I agree with you, Rob.
3768461	3773763	Once again, you know, other problems, and then because he's playing video games, obviously the video games are the problem.
3774563	3775324	Fucking hate people.
3775404	3775724	Hold on.
3776084	3778045	Did Jamie say she agreed with me?
3779795	3781537	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob
3805293	3807900	Hey, all of our Eddie Izzard fans, I bought jammy Dodgers.
3807920	3810686	Will you Dodger that jammy when I shove it up your ass?
3811428	3814315	Then fine, you don't get any of the stuff I bought for Part B.
3815487	3819831	No, but I want the stuff you brought from Part B. I know, the stuff I brought from Part B is great.
3819971	3825316	So, some news comes from apparently a... Oh wait, I'm sorry, can I read chat comments?
3825576	3828098	Because I was ignoring the chat and that was a big story, so I'm sorry.
3828739	3831381	I was too busy fighting with Jamie, I hope you all will understand.
3832682	3838227	RawSteelUT says, it's a symptom of a larger problem that is ignored because the video games are a scapegoat.
3838908	3841530	That's a very good word for what's going on there, scapegoat.
3843217	3849262	Gold Banjo says, I have so much video game systems and stuff that I always have stuff to do when my parents take away something.
3850363	3853425	Well, maybe they need to lock you in a room with fluffy walls then.
3853465	3853785	I don't know.
3854386	3856247	Blaze says, I don't buy this addiction thing.
3856288	3859510	Those types of doctors are the same that buy into the whole truth serum thing.
3859710	3860051	Yikes.
3861332	3861532	All right.
3861612	3861792	Anyway.
3863636	3875254	So, apparently, it was coming from a GameSpot forum poster that said they took part in a recent survey about an unannounced PlayStation Network episodic game called 9 to 5.
3877021	3887047	Apparently the game is supposed to be kind of like an interactive sitcom where you're basically kissing the boss's butt to avoid being fired.
3887627	3891590	You know, all sorts of weird stuff like that, kind of like The Office or something.
3892070	3899755	Anyways, they're saying that it's supposed to have four episodes which introduce you to Megacorp, I guess a...
3900755	3901596	Thank you for watching!
3922230	3930692	Written and I guess voice acted by people that have been on Comedy Central, Saturday Night Live, Daily Show, Chappelle's Show, Conan O'Brien, etc.
3932812	3933293	Interesting.
3933713	3938714	And the game's supposed to run about $5 for an episode or $14 for all four.
3939474	3942815	Wonder Dog Harold says 9 to 5 should be based on the movie.
3943615	3944375	Fuck yes!
3946296	3947016	Dolly Parton!
3947436	3948136	Hell yeah!
3949562	3950763	Working 9 to 5.
3952064	3954866	I almost watched that the other night because I was feeling a little gay.
3954926	3956627	Because it is Pride weekend after all.
3956687	3959409	So I felt like I had to do something really gay this weekend.
3959429	3962010	So I almost watched 9 to 5 last night.
3962070	3963671	But then I opted to go to bed instead.
3964252	3970876	I didn't do any Pride festivities this weekend because I'm not into that whole parade and running around shirtless thing.
3971076	3971556	I don't get it.
3972037	3972497	Not my thing.
3973518	3976840	Anyhow, let's go on to the next story.
3978297	3979097	Next story.
3979538	3988582	Well, for all of us who are fans of Hudson Soft, Rising Star Games has a deal to bring seven titles to Europe.
3989603	3996086	This is taking place between September and March 2008 for PSPDS and Wii.
3996926	4001789	And there's not really a list of what those are, except for possibly Harvest Moon and Rainbow Islands.
4004090	4004610	Bomberman!
4006399	4013662	Oh, so, hooray, another Harvest Moon game on the Wii.
4013682	4014963	Is that really a surprise to anybody?
4016283	4016543	No.
4017164	4018024	Chirp, chirp, chirp.
4018104	4026367	Speaking of which, there's like two more Harvest Moon games coming out this summer on PSP and DS.
4027568	4029008	Shock and awe, I'm so surprised.
4029028	4030669	And guess what, they're all the same!
4030809	4032770	And they're still not as good as Animal Crossing.
4034807	4036989	All the fucking same, and you people still buy them.
4052611	4066137	But what's going on here is that Sony, who is the director of PlayStation Network Operations, Eric Lempel, said that the PlayStation Network may not always be free.
4066877	4074300	He said basically that the PlayStation Network's only real difference over Xbox Live is the price, which, you know, interesting.
4074580	4078882	But then, of course, then this other exec kind of stepped in and then said, well, it may not always be free.
4078962	4080082	So kind of interesting.
4081212	4109789	and I wouldn't say that's the only difference between the two well yeah that and the Xbox Live Marketplace has a lot of content whereas the PlayStation Network as I understand it has very little content now granted PlayStation Network has some very good content like that Tekken game good start and you know there's a lot of promising things about some of these originals they're making on PlayStation Network they look a heck of a lot more promising than some of the rehashed stuff we get on Xbox Live but you know is it going to be too little too late that's you know all I worry about so
4112112	4116174	Speaking of something a little too late, Dead or Alive the movie.
4117215	4119376	Delayed forever and then finally came out.
4120096	4121157	And how did it do?
4121537	4122718	Well, it sucked.
4123538	4127821	It stinks, as Jay would say from the critic.
4128381	4135345	Apparently opened on 505 screens across the country and pulled in a whopping $232,000 worth.
4138001	4139281	Which is crappy.
4139301	4141482	That's about $460 per screen.
4141542	4143122	Oh my god, that's atrocious.
4143842	4146583	That's like what movies at discount theaters make.
4146643	4150004	That's when a movie is almost on video, what it's supposed to make.
4150124	4152164	That's really bad.
4152464	4153904	Is that because piracy ruined it?
4154244	4158945	Is that because... I never saw a single ad for this game outside of the internet anywhere.
4159266	4160546	Is it just lack of promotion?
4160766	4165907	Lack of promotion, but it also opened up against... What the hell did it open up against?
4166454	4168315	Something that was a lot better than it was
4182145	4183246	I still want to see it.
4183266	4183466	Let's see.
4199335	4201457	RawSteelUT says, Sky, it's because it sucked.
4201977	4204539	And that's what Sycoon says too, it's because it fucking sucked.
4206140	4209283	The AfroGuy said, why isn't the Dead or Alive movie on DVD?
4209463	4211825	I mean, why didn't it go straight to DVD?
4212385	4213186	That's a good question.
4213586	4219271	Loki, I don't know, you used to do, before you were doing games distribution, you did movie distribution, so any insight on that?
4219311	4221512	What kind of movies tend to go directly to DVD?
4223634	4223954	Well...
4225194	4227876	Besides the Disney sequels like Cinderella 3.
4228496	4230958	There are a lot of Disney sequels that go straight to DVD.
4231639	4237322	Usually movies that they don't want to spend money on advertising because it costs a lot of money to advertise a movie.
4237402	4242546	And if they feel it's not going to do that well in theaters, they'll release it straight to DVD.
4243547	4244587	Actually, there's a whole set of...
4247967	4248347	Oh, Gobots!
4269799	4272882	and also they have, was it Snakes on a Train?
4273282	4273763	Stuff like that.
4274103	4274904	So a lot of that goes through.
4274924	4276965	I like Cheese just said that, Snakes on a Train.
4277206	4277386	Yeah.
4277986	4282570	But also, what was that movie we all watched, Cheerleading Ninjas or whatever that was?
4282590	4283331	Cheerleader Ninjas.
4283351	4284412	That movie was incredible.
4284452	4286073	That was not.
4287114	4288255	I've got some good ones, though.
4288375	4289997	I've got some good ones that are coming out.
4291017	4293520	Was it Dead Clowns about zombie clowns?
4293800	4294581	That's going to be cool.
4294861	4297223	Oh, God, is it Clowns from Outer Space?
4297864	4299846	Killer Clowns from Outer Space, that's going to be awesome.
4300246	4302488	Now, that already came out years ago, and it sucked.
4302508	4303448	I know, and it was awesome.
4303709	4305990	I want to have a whole clown horror night.
4307512	4312636	People are raving about the DVD sequels in chat, even though this isn't game-related.
4313056	4313957	I guess it is a little bit.
4314677	4317039	DarkTetsuya says, I mean, really, Bambi 2, WTF?
4317059	4319441	I don't know, what the hell, Bambi 2?
4320022	4321943	Bambi 2, my mom is still dead.
4322023	4325346	No, Bambi 2, Bambi was grown up, and it's his kids now, so...
4326414	4327254	Oh, that makes it okay.
4327314	4328315	That's a big Disney cop-out.
4328815	4335098	I'm sorry, the only Bambi 2 I was ever interested in was there was Godzilla vs. Bambi, and then Godzilla vs. Bambi 2, Bambi's Revenge.
4338279	4340460	Godzilla vs. Bambi was just... Alone in the Dark 2.
4340520	4343742	The Afro guy says, isn't there a Lion King 4?
4344222	4349204	I don't know if there's a Lion King 4, but if I remember right, there was a Lion King, like, two and a half.
4349685	4350225	One and a half.
4350845	4354947	But one of these movies, I don't know if it was one and a half or Lion King 3, one of these movies was...
4356108	4357309	and DarkSakura.com.
4381119	4383141	But yeah, there's a lot that goes straight to DVD.
4383442	4385283	I mean, just look at your video store.
4385323	4387165	So why not Dead or Alive?
4387205	4388767	This was a prime candidate to go straight to DVD.
4388787	4395053	It was supposed to go straight to DVD at one time, but they decided, hey, we're going to release it to the theaters because people are going to go see it.
4395703	4396484	Boy, were they wrong.
4396824	4399546	But how much money does it cost to put a movie in theaters?
4399906	4402728	I mean, if they didn't spend any money on promotion, did they really lose anything?
4403348	4403948	Not a whole lot.
4403989	4405089	They probably wouldn't lose anything.
4405229	4410073	It actually probably would help the film a little bit, especially if they leave it in there long enough to do a few million dollars.
4410193	4412234	Because they'll be able to get that one critic.
4412254	4416517	Because the thing about putting your movie in theaters is that the critics will review it.
4417077	4425845	So you'll get that one critic who will give the movie an amazing review just because he wants to have his name in all the papers and the advertisement.
4426246	4431070	Like, Dead or Alive is a, what's a quote you could say?
4431090	4432451	Sexy action thriller!
4432572	4437776	Dead or Alive is a very tantalizing action movie, you know?
4438697	4439258	And it sucks.
4439318	4441640	But they wouldn't say that, you know, they'd leave that part out.
4441680	4442581	Yeah, dot dot dot.
4444329	4459701	Sexy Action If you were to call this movie Great and Awesome you would be horribly wrong Great and Awesome DJ Morpheus in chat room makes a local joke Those of you folks from Sacramento will love this joke And it's always Mark S. Allen
4463969	4470654	Tiger Claw says there's a Starship Troopers 3 in the works that's going straight to video and Casper Van Dien is reprising the role he did in the first movie.
4470974	4473576	That's because Casper Van Dien hasn't really done anything in the series.
4473596	4475077	Oh, he has done a lot of things.
4475097	4475357	Has he?
4475377	4476598	It's all straight to DVD.
4477078	4478739	Well, that's a heck of a career.
4479760	4483963	There's a lot of people that, that's how you know they've kind of lost it.
4484783	4489066	Was it Jean-Claude Van Damme and fucking Steven Seagal, man?
4489086	4490227	They're still making stuff.
4491067	4491767	A lot of things.
4492287	4493788	People actually buy that shit up.
4494008	4496609	Same thing with Chuck Norris, dude.
4496649	4497829	Chuck Norris hasn't made too much.
4498210	4502111	I still say they need to do Chuck Norris versus the world, you know, because I would say that.
4502271	4504992	I say Freddy versus Jason versus Walker, Texas Ranger.
4505472	4506012	How about that?
4507673	4510494	Chuck Norris versus Michael Myers.
4511855	4512855	Okay, now we're crazy.
4513475	4515116	Versus the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
4515136	4515616	Now we're crazy.
4516198	4516918	Alright, anyway.
4517298	4523059	Somebody also made a point much earlier, and I apologize because your comment scrolled way off the screen, but somebody said, porn goes direct to DVD.
4523600	4523960	All of it.
4524660	4524860	Yeah.
4525420	4526160	Well, I don't know.
4526200	4528701	We don't really keep tabs of the porno theaters around here.
4528721	4530941	Yeah, theaters weren't really what they used to be for porn.
4531721	4532301	If you know what I mean.
4534102	4537582	Drew Nami would like to point out that Orange Lounge is not Baron's chat.
4538142	4539223	That's a World of Warcraft joke.
4540183	4541143	Anyhow, alright.
4541203	4543604	I guess we're going to bring this segment to a close here.
4543624	4545004	We're going to finish off Part A here.
4545344	4545724	However...
4546607	4551772	Part B is coming up, and we're actually going to put the news away tonight for Part B. We're all done with the news.
4552413	4555937	Actually, I should ask real quick, Loki, do you have any last-minute things you want to add?
4555957	4556958	Because I know you had a few stories.
4557378	4557778	Maybe.
4558419	4559040	All right, go ahead.
4559100	4559320	Go ahead.
4559775	4561056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4579714	4591401	The people that have listened every week, that have stuck with Orange Lounge Radio for the past five years, and really helped make this show what it is, and quite honestly, given us the motivation to continue to do this show.
4591882	4598686	It's never really been about the number of people that are listening, because to put it in perspective, we don't talk about the number of people we have listen to our show very often.
4599346	4601287	To me, that's private information.
4601728	4604209	That's our business, and we don't really need to brag.
4604489	4608332	But for real, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio had...
4608871	4609332	And I couldn't.
4621438	4621938	and I couldn't.
4622018	4623159	That's right, because you were in a weird place.
4623179	4625500	Because it was in direct competition at the time of DDR Freak Radio.
4625600	4638484	And we can admit now, five years later, that a whole lot of this, this is the weirdest thing happened here is that Iguana Girl and I used to be BFF, but then we had like a major falling out and Iguana Girl and I didn't speak for like three years.
4638524	4639925	Seriously, it was pretty dirty.
4640405	4641928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4653624	4654865	We had a peace treaty signature.
4655045	4662871	Anyway, but the weirdest thing happened is that DDR Freak Radio started, like, and Orange Lounge Radio, like, both of us had the plans to do an online radio station.
4662891	4663632	I didn't say anything.
4663832	4666334	Yeah, and nobody, neither one of us kind of knew what the other was doing.
4666354	4667094	And I knew on both ends.
4667775	4669176	So it was just kind of weird the way that happened.
4669496	4671057	But regardless, why did we bring that up?
4671097	4678263	Oh, yeah, because we, I tried to promote a lot on DDR Freak and some of the other, I can't remember if Bomani Style even existed at the time, but some of the other DDR sites.
4678283	4679003	Bomani Style was around.
4679023	4679384	Were they?
4679404	4679544	Yeah.
4680214	4684796	Some of the other sites that were around at that time, we tried to promote the show, and we had a whopping 15 listeners for the first episode.
4685556	4695700	And pretty much, honestly, guys, for about the first three years of Orange Lingerie, for about the first three years of Orange Lingerie, I would say we were lucky if we pulled 40 listeners in the third year.
4696900	4699041	And that's just the way live radio is, boys and girls.
4699061	4704143	A lot of folks don't – live through CC5 kind of limits us a little bit, and the fact that it's live –
4705578	4709140	Some other people have better things to do Sunday night, which is understandable.
4709460	4713803	But really, podcasting, audio blogging, whatever you want to call it, it really opened doors for us.
4714223	4721568	Because we were really fortunate to jump on that train before it really took off when iTunes incorporated podcasting in June of 2005.
4722248	4724170	And that was just really awesome for us.
4724210	4728072	And now our listenership is, I can say it's in the thousands.
4728352	4730253	We're not talking like 9,000, more like 2,000 or 3,000 people that we have.
4730273	4731174	We had the 4,000 a week.
4735074	4736995	Yeah, I mean, but, you know, it doesn't... You know, whatever.
4737255	4741256	It's just interesting that it's blown up so much thanks to this podcasting thing.
4741576	4743697	But for me, really, not a lot's changed.
4743777	4747958	The motivation continues to be... Because we don't hear from all 4,000 of you.
4748018	4751019	We appreciate the fact that you guys are listening to the show.
4751219	4752840	Dear God, not all 4,000 people email me.
4753600	4754600	We appreciate that you're listening.
4754620	4755280	I think they should.
4755360	4756741	And, you know, we don't... We can check the email.
4756781	4757161	How's that?
4757341	4758221	Let me say this, too.
4758281	4760482	I got to try to wrap this up because I don't want... But...
4761289	4763511	We speculate we have about 1,800 real actual people subscribing to the show.
4763531	4764432	But anyway, that's regardless.
4776728	4779370	You know, we don't hear from all those people on a real regular basis.
4779510	4780311	It's the chatters.
4780451	4781292	It's the callers.
4781472	4783753	It's the folks that send us emails.
4783813	4787776	It's the people that reach out that really have kind of given us that motivation to keep going for the past five years.
4787796	4788597	At least that's how I feel.
4788677	4791479	I don't know about you guys, but that's really been what it is.
4792480	4797583	Well, I personally want to dedicate our success to the powers of the underworld.
4800345	4802347	And that demonic pact you signed one day?
4803127	4805369	Yeah, but they offended me, my soul.
4807448	4808469	Loki, anything you want to add?
4808509	4808809	I don't know.
4809169	4811270	What keeps you motivated week after week to do this program?
4812410	4813031	I'm motivated.
4814191	4814671	You're an asshole.
4814691	4815372	I'm motivated.
4816112	4819233	Like on my live journal, it says I'm motivated by spite and porn.
4820314	4823435	I'm motivated by my non-video game addiction.
4823996	4825077	I don't like turns!
4825117	4825657	Too bad.
4853101	4855403	So we'll be back, and who knows what could happen.
4855443	4858165	It's going to be a very interesting Part B on this, our five-year anniversary.
4858205	4861427	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and supporting Independent Radio.
4861847	4863788	You guys are awesome, and you're the reason we're here.
4864089	4865350	We'll be right back after this with more.
4866210	4871174	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4871654	4875957	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
