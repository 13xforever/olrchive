0	19440	Today, June 24th, 2007, our introduction takes a little trip down memory lane.
19440	30400	Hey, where are we going?
30400	59360	The Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
59360	71600	Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.
71600	82480	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things
82480	89760	that are evil.
89760	92640	So you probably shouldn't let your children listen.
92640	97200	If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little
97200	98200	demons from hell.
98200	99200	Oh, wait.
99200	100200	Most children already are evil little demons from hell.
100200	109840	Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
109840	112880	In fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.
112880	116560	He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
116560	121120	Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
121120	122120	Samburgers!
122120	124480	The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
124480	125480	That was huge.
125480	126480	Cool.
126480	130480	Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?
130480	131480	Yeah, that's right.
131480	135480	The only thing you're going to be riding is me.
135480	137480	Have you seen Malcolm?
137480	138480	Lena?
138480	141600	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.
141600	143600	So it was you.
143600	144840	I was going to expose you.
144840	145840	I know.
145840	147480	So I choose to expose myself.
147480	148800	Please, there are ladies present.
148800	151480	This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
151480	152480	Dark Sakura.
152480	155640	Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!
155640	156640	Sky.
156640	157640	Anytime, anyplace, baby.
157640	158640	Loki.
158640	159640	Ow, my foot!
159640	162800	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
162800	166680	Orange Lounge Radio.
166680	173120	We are live on this June the 24th of 2007.
173120	175240	Good god that was a bloated ass intro.
175240	178480	That was actually, that was one of our old intros.
178480	180600	That intro's like two minutes long.
180600	182320	Go figure.
182320	185040	We actually used that for like a year.
185040	190960	Anyway, hi and welcome to that show dedicated not just to Bomani now but after several years
190960	196120	on the air we evolved to talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.
196120	197520	My name is Rob Roberts.
197520	202040	Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
202040	203040	Hi.
203040	207880	Five years, and that's all you have to say is, ah.
207880	208880	Hi.
208880	211520	That's how I'd sum it up too, really.
211520	213920	And also say hello, as always, to Tech Master Loki.
213920	214920	Hello.
214920	215920	How you doing, Loki?
215920	216920	I'm doing fine.
216920	217920	All right.
217920	218920	Sounds good.
218920	219920	Well, there you have it.
219920	222200	It's just the three of us tonight because tonight is a special night.
222200	226600	It is our fifth anniversary show, and hello to those of you in our chat room, the always
226600	232920	present fourth guest in our program, chat.orangelaungerator.com, the biggest our chat room has ever been.
232920	237200	Thank you guys so much, and a big thank you to allgames.com as well, who's simulcasting
237200	241720	our live broadcast tonight to accommodate everybody that wanted to listen to us live.
241720	242960	That's so awesome.
242960	247720	Anyway, here we are all these years later, and we're still talking about the latest and
247720	251880	what's going on in the news and gaming culture, but most importantly, us.
251880	255800	We start the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, so let's kick it over
255800	256800	to Dark Sakura.
256800	257800	How was your gaming week?
257800	259480	I played World of Warcraft.
259480	260480	You were there.
260480	261840	I was there.
261840	265480	And then I signed off to go talk to people because I like living.
265480	268120	Wait, you mean you signed off for real life?
268120	269120	Sort of.
269120	270120	That's no fun.
270120	271120	I've been working overtime all week, so.
271120	272120	Ew, that's no fun at all.
272120	273120	Money is good.
273120	274120	Money is good.
274120	275120	Yeah.
275120	276120	Appreciate that.
276120	277120	All right.
277120	278920	Say hello as well to Loki, and how was your gaming week?
278920	283200	I played a bunch of things, actually.
283200	290780	I tried WTF, or Work Time Fun, I guess, for the PSB.
290780	291920	It's pretty awesome.
291920	292920	It's a little weird.
292920	294640	A lot of the games are very mundane.
294640	299680	It's just working, like one of them that you put caps on pens.
299680	300800	That's it.
300800	304240	There's another one that's pretty funny, though, where you are a drunken mayor and you have
304240	308440	to stumble your way over to a ribbon to cut it.
308440	316680	So you basically earn money to use in these little gumball vending machines to get little
316680	319960	trinkets and useless crap.
319960	321260	And that's the whole game.
321260	323600	So that's kind of interesting.
323600	330220	The other game I played this week was Hot Pixel for the PSP, thanks to somebody leaking
330220	332600	it on the internet.
332600	336120	And thank God they leaked it on the internet, because I would not have wanted to buy this
336120	337120	game.
337120	339200	It was horrible.
339200	340760	It's short, for one.
340760	345560	I mean, I beat the game under an hour, so that's pretty bad.
345560	350720	The second thing is, the guy behind it, this French guy who does this podcast, I believe
350720	357440	it's called Street Smart Cool Cat, he's a fucking retard.
357440	358600	I fucking hate him.
358600	361440	I hate him even more after playing this game.
361440	362800	He is a complete douche.
362800	368840	He is, like, the beginning of each level that you play, he's doing something stupid to make
368840	372220	himself look really cool, and he's not.
372220	376740	He's like a cross between fucking Bill Nye the Science Guy and Screech, except not smart
376740	379960	and nerdier.
379960	384800	Then I also played, let's see, Transformers, the game on the PSP.
384800	389920	Thank God I'm not buying the PSP one, although I will be playing the 361 later this week.
389920	394160	I just wanted to see what the PSP one looked like, and it's not very good.
394160	398600	But if you only have a PSP, then, I don't know, maybe it's worth picking up.
398600	402760	Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, I actually played some of the single player part of that,
402760	404160	so that was kind of interesting.
404160	405760	Pretty good storyline so far.
405760	410520	Of course, multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, and, let's see, off of
410520	414880	the PSP, I also played Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link.
414880	417880	Still hate that game, but I'm still playing it.
417880	424600	Earth Defense Force 2, I actually tried that on the PlayStation 2.
424600	425600	It's interesting.
425600	426920	I don't like the controls too much.
426920	430760	I'm not sure if there's a way to configure it so it's exactly like the Xbox 360, because
430760	434840	I think that would really help, because right now, the way they have it set up, your look
434840	439320	and movement are the same analog six, so that kind of sucks.
439320	440600	But otherwise, it looks pretty cool.
440600	445040	You get the Destroy Big Ben in the first level.
445040	446040	Let's see, what else?
446040	450200	Oh, I also played, of course, more Earth Defense Force 2017.
450200	453480	Finished the game on hard now, and now we're going through hardest and Inferno.
453480	457280	It's about time you beat that damn game, because I swear, for like the past ten weeks I've
457280	462680	beat the game on easy, normal, and now hard.
462680	466820	It's just I have to play through it all the time until we get the genocide gun.
466820	469240	Is this something about trying to get all 1000 achievement points?
469240	472320	Well, I just want the genocide gun, and unfortunately I have to beat the whole game.
472320	473920	The genocide gun.
473920	479560	Does a million damage per shot, and blows up everything.
479560	484040	And then, yeah, that's actually I think about it for the week.
484040	486840	All right, well you've got a lot of playing done.
486840	490400	I had a pretty mellow gaming week, kind of like Dark Sakura.
490400	495360	I pretty much spent all my time on World of Warcraft, because I'm a sad, sad little addict,
495360	498560	but I reached a real milestone in World of Warcraft this week.
498560	504440	I hit level 60 today, hooray, which now is kind of dwarfed by the fact that you can actually
504440	508960	go to 70 in Burning Crusade, so I'm just waiting for the people in chat to go, I'm level 70.
508960	512240	But I still think 60 is kind of a bit of a landmark, and just goes to show you what a
512240	514080	sad little addict I really am.
514080	519180	But our guild is really growing on there, and it's been a lot of fun, and we have Ventrilo
519180	523320	and all that fun stuff, so it's a fun time waster.
523320	525600	Other than that, not a whole lot.
525600	530240	I checked out the new Xbox Live Arcade titled the Band of Bugs game, did you check that
530240	531240	out at all?
531240	532240	No.
532240	533640	I know usually you check out the arcade releases.
533640	537360	It's kind of like a Final Fantasy Tactics-ish game, it's your tactical type of game.
537360	538760	That I definitely won't be playing it.
538760	542640	Yeah, I know, it's not really, well I don't know, because I really dug Final Fantasy Tactics,
542640	545960	but I didn't play enough of Band of Bugs to give it a fair review, I didn't even purchase
545960	550880	the retail one, but I did check it out, and it was a little bit of my gaming week, and
550880	554120	I was like, oh, I don't know if I could, it was kind of one of those things where I'm
554120	558400	playing so much freaking WoW that I don't really have time for another tactical game.
558400	560080	So much for that.
560080	566040	However, I did also, I got onto GameTap for some strange reason, I decided, oh, I'm paying
566040	569520	for this, I should probably check it out again, and I just started, I had like a marathon
569520	574040	the other day, I was playing all these old-school Atari 2600 games, like I was playing Kaboom
574040	576640	for like an hour and a half, it was kind of sad.
576640	580240	That's that game, like you remember on the old-school 2600 with the little paddle, except
580240	583800	now you use your mouse and you catch the bombs, like I don't know what it is, like some people
583800	586780	can sit there and play Bejeweled for hours, I was playing Kaboom.
586780	590480	And then I played Pitfall, the old-school Pitfall, and I'm a lot better at it now than
590480	592280	I was when I was seven, go figure.
592280	595640	So I actually played through quite a ways in the game.
595640	599840	And I like how GameTap is really taking a lot of good ideas from Xbox Live and incorporating
599840	603640	into their service, like now you have a profile page that shows the last games that you've
603640	606400	played, and all that stuff, where have I seen this before?
606400	611440	And then you have your leaderboards on the actual service itself, so pretty cool.
611440	614840	You know, hey, if it's a good idea, why not borrow it?
614840	617540	I was going to say rip it off, but I guess it would be borrow it.
617540	622640	So I do like how GameTap's growing, and it'll be interesting when it comes over to the Macs,
622640	626000	and more people that I know have been holding out on GameTap because it's not out on Mac,
626000	627560	will be able to come over.
627560	631600	So that was really it, otherwise a little bit of Puzzle Quest, and that was pretty much
631600	632600	it.
632600	633600	I didn't play a lot of console games this week, funny enough.
633600	640400	I got Season 1 of Sam & Max, I haven't installed it yet though, but I'm planning on playing
640400	641400	it.
641400	646640	I'm just kind of on the fritz right now, something's going out in it, because it randomly shuts
646640	651400	off completely, so I'm thinking either the power supply, hard drive, or motherboard's
651400	652400	going out.
652400	654000	Either way, I need to upgrade the damn thing.
654000	656660	It's been like years.
656660	661080	Going to the chat room, the always present, chat.orangemanjr.com, always the fourth guest,
661080	663800	always has been for the past five years, always will be.
663800	668720	We'll start out with this lovely comment tonight, rostielut in chat says, Sky, god, stop sucking
668720	671140	GameTap's cock.
671140	675480	You know, you'd think I'm on their payroll or something, I swear to god I'm not.
675480	678520	I think it's just a pretty good thing.
678520	682080	It's relatively cheap, you get a lot of games, it's not a bad deal.
682080	684200	If I like something, I'm going to tell you I like it.
684200	686400	Talk about Xbox Live all the time, we're not in their payroll.
686400	687400	I do, yeah.
687400	688400	I'm not sucking their cock.
688400	689400	We're not in anybody's payroll, which sucks.
689400	693240	I kind of wish I was getting some nookie from all these people, that would be a lot of fun.
693240	696800	I want them to hire me to rub them while they're naked.
696800	699480	You want to give a little massage loving to GameTap?
699480	703840	Dude, I would love to go to the video game companies and be their massage therapist.
703840	705480	Would you give out some happy endings?
705480	707440	Would you give Reggie a happy ending?
707440	710520	Rob, I don't think that's funny.
710520	715360	Oh, and black boy in the chat room says, Loki should buy a new MacBook.
715360	719040	That's funny, because see, the next computer I'm buying, my benchmark is it's going to
719040	721760	be able to run Crysis very well.
721760	728440	Unfortunately, a MacBook would just explode by, I don't know, even thinking about running
728440	729440	Crysis.
729440	730440	No.
730440	731440	Ah, let's see.
731440	734640	What wasn't so negative that was said in chat here that we could also read?
734640	738560	Hitstun says, I like GameTap so far, but I don't have the disk space or clock speed for
738560	740320	any of the newer stuff.
740320	741320	Fair enough.
741320	744800	I suppose my computer, I replaced my computer about a year and a half ago, so it's a little
744800	747960	bit newer, so it can run some of these more higher end stuff.
747960	751680	And some folks who haven't replaced their computer in a few years are probably struggling
751680	752680	a little more.
752680	753680	I'm in the process of rebuilding.
753680	756960	Well, not necessarily rebuilding, but I'm adding in stuff to the one that was given
756960	757960	to me.
757960	758960	All right.
758960	759960	Cool.
759960	767880	Yeah, I like to build my own computer as opposed to having the whole Dell-in-a-box type thing.
767880	773560	I re-downloaded MAME today, and along with it, of course, the first ROMs I re-downloaded
773560	775400	were all the Gals Panic series.
775400	776400	Good job.
776400	778220	How about Miss World 96?
778220	781960	I think I might have grabbed that, just because I knew you would laugh.
781960	787280	What I was trying to do was install Guitar Freak's 5th Mix on my laptop to be able to
787280	793360	play with the Guitar Hero controller, unfortunately 5th Mix at the moment I don't think is compatible
793360	794360	with MAME.
794360	795360	I don't know.
795360	797700	They also have 3rd Korean on there, which I thought was kind of funny.
797700	799680	They actually have DDR games playable in MAME?
799680	800680	I never knew that.
800680	801680	Yeah.
801680	802680	It's kind of weird.
802680	806640	I don't think they're playable well, like audio problems, but I don't know.
806640	809400	Have they actually enabled the new Capcom board?
809400	813000	I remember last week we reported Street Fighter 3 and stuff, so that's now in there?
813000	814440	Yes, I think so.
814440	817000	I remember seeing some.
817000	825680	I want to see the Sega boards emulated, because I want Planet Harrier.
825680	830760	You know, I sometimes will go without playing MAME for a long time, and then I go back and
830760	833040	I kind of check on it, and they have all this crazy stuff playable.
833040	834040	Planet Harrier.
834040	835040	It might be there.
835040	836040	You should check.
836040	837040	I don't know.
837040	838040	We haven't been able to emulate the board.
838040	839040	Don't.
839040	841040	Does anybody in chat room know if they're ever going to get that?
841040	842040	Who knows?
842040	843040	All right.
843040	844720	Well, that was our gaming week.
844720	849520	Let's get on to some other stuff before we get into the news, like some housekeeping.
849520	852920	We just wanted to say tonight, of course, it's our fifth anniversary show.
852920	854040	Not a whole lot.
854040	856480	I don't know.
856480	861120	I don't know how you guys feel, but I wasn't really all about tooting our own horns tonight.
861120	865840	This is more like fan service for the listeners tonight with the different intro and the fact
865840	869780	that we are dedicating all of Part B tonight to our listeners, so we're going to invite
869780	875640	you guys later on to call in, chat with us, just talk about what's going on in gaming,
875640	877100	and that'll be that.
877100	879480	That's kind of our special plan for the fifth anniversary show.
879480	888680	No A-list celebrities, no surprise major gaming celebrity guests or anything like that, but
888680	889680	you never know.
889680	890680	I don't know.
890680	893360	I tried to send email to some people that do other shows and stuff, like, hey, we're
893360	894360	going to be taking calls.
894360	895360	Who knows?
895360	896920	We might get surprises as folks might call in.
896920	899720	That would be pretty rad, so we'll see what happens.
899720	905680	Anyhow, let's get onto the gaming news, because we do it every week.
905680	907040	We do it every other week, so why not?
907040	909120	We'll talk about it this week as well.
909120	913140	Of course, unless you've been living in a cave in the gaming world this week, you probably
913140	918680	have heard about this, but Manhunt 2, controversy, controversy, controversy, okay, God, how do
918680	920680	I sum this all up?
920680	924500	I realize most people have probably read this all online already, so how do I sum this up?
924500	931520	The game was effectively banned in Britain, not so much that they banned it, but basically
931520	935240	they said, we're not going to rate it, and when the game doesn't have a rating, then
935240	937680	you can't sell it.
937680	941520	In a roundabout way, it was banned, if that makes sense.
941520	943680	They're not going to be able to sell this game in Britain.
943680	948040	Then people are saying, oh, well, this game is so horrible.
948040	952880	They should rate it AO in America, and it turns out, oh, the game has been rated AO
952880	958120	here in America, adults only, which is a rating that's been reserved for very, very few games,
958120	963280	lots of very under the radar type of sex games have gotten this type of rating.
963280	964280	All on PC, by the way.
964280	965280	Yeah, they're all PC.
965280	969160	Well, because, and then the next part of this was, if the game has continued to stay rated
969160	974240	AO, the Nintendo will not endorse it, Sony will not endorse it, and Microsoft will not
974240	975240	allow it.
975240	976240	Which is fucked up.
976240	977240	They will all not allow the product to come out on the systems.
977240	978240	That's fucked up.
978240	981420	Okay, here's the first place, or here's the first question I'm going to ask, and maybe
981420	984080	somebody's already asked this, I don't know if you know the answer.
984080	986040	What about a Renegade release?
986040	989620	Because I remember back in the day, I remember on Nintendo, like there were companies that
989620	994060	would make games without the official Nintendo seal of equality, like Color Dreams, remember
994060	999120	those like ugly-ass blue cartridges and the really horrible games that came out from them?
999120	1005120	Like they could do it, but I'm thinking maybe it's because Take-Two is a big, big publisher,
1005120	1006320	they don't want to burn their bridges.
1006320	1010880	Well, not only that, but I mean, they could still release everything Renegade or whatever,
1010880	1015240	but I think now that they actually do have to get everything licensed in order to be
1015240	1020120	able to actually press this, that's why everything has to go through certification before it
1020120	1025800	can actually go gold and get this press on it, so I don't know.
1025800	1031440	I don't know why they, I wish, the whole thing between AO and mature-retarded anyways, because
1031440	1037320	what you're saying is this game is not suitable for 17-year-olds, which I don't know, hostile
1037320	1042360	too out there, it's all about torture and people's limbs getting chopped off and like
1042360	1043360	rape and stuff.
1043360	1044360	Naked chicks dancing in blood.
1044360	1050320	And naked chicks dancing in blood, and that's a suitable for 17-year-olds, but oh, a pixelated
1050320	1056880	video game, oh okay, well that's way, 17-year-olds go, oh wait, this is teaching me how to commit
1056880	1061080	murder, okay, I'm going to go murder somebody now, come on, I mean seriously, grow the fuck
1061080	1066520	up, and they're all, well this is to keep it out of our children's hands.
1066520	1070600	It's not supposed to be in children's hands, it's fucking 17 and over.
1070600	1075720	Quick comments from chat room, let's see, Corey 31 says, but no stores will sell it,
1075720	1076720	that's the main problem.
1076720	1077720	Oh, but it will.
1077720	1080600	Like, Sylvara follows up, Walmart, Target, Blockbuster wouldn't sell it.
1080600	1082640	Who cares, that's a selling point for the independents.
1082640	1083640	Internet!
1083640	1086400	No, independent stores would carry that shit, in fact, when they heard that it was going
1086400	1091480	to be adults only, and that Blockbuster, Gamefly, and Walmart weren't going to be carrying it,
1091480	1095960	they're like, I'll double my order, you know, so that shit would still sell, it may not
1095960	1099120	sell as fast, but it would still sell.
1099120	1101400	Here's a comment from Take Two.
1101400	1106280	This actually comes from, I'm not sure who at Take Two, this is a general comment from
1106280	1111640	Take Two, quote, the ESRB has issued an initial rating of AO, adults only, for Manhunt 2.
1111640	1114760	Oh, this is an actual statement they made.
1114760	1118440	We believe the process of rating video games is to help people make informed entertainment
1118440	1120280	choices and not to limit them.
1120280	1123600	Manhunt 2 is created for mature audiences and we strongly believe it should receive
1123600	1127880	an M rating, aligning it with similar content created in other forms of media.
1127880	1131400	We are exploring other options with regards to Manhunt 2.
1131400	1134680	Yeah, and I do think that they're unfairly being targeted.
1134680	1141680	It's always, you know, Take Two is always the target of both advocates for like, you
1141680	1145840	know, family games and stuff like that.
1145840	1149960	Here's the thing though, I mean, from what I've heard about this game, and granted, I've
1149960	1153560	never played the original Manhunt, it wasn't really on my radar, I never played it.
1153560	1157800	Although, I have to admit, when I heard that this game was coming out for the Wii, I was
1157800	1162080	very interested, because yes, there is a sadistic side of me that thinks it would be kind of
1162080	1166720	fun to chop people up in many gruesome ways with the Wiimote and the nunchuck.
1166720	1168440	Come on, you all were thinking it, right?
1168440	1170340	You already had it pre-ordered.
1170340	1173400	Who wasn't like Dark Soccer, weren't you looking forward to taking out your aggressions with
1173400	1176200	the Wii, like chainsaw people's faces off or whatever you can do in the game?
1176200	1177760	I don't know, I'm making stuff up.
1177760	1178760	No.
1178760	1179760	No?
1179760	1181320	I didn't really care about this game, I didn't like the first one.
1181320	1183160	Oh, you actually played the first one?
1183160	1184640	Yeah, I had it on Dreamcast.
1184640	1185640	Oh, how was it?
1185640	1186640	Kind of crappy?
1186640	1187640	Oh, okay.
1187640	1190080	Well, Dan liked it.
1190080	1192880	It was an okay game, it just wasn't my type of game, so I didn't...
1192880	1193880	Was it on Dreamcast?
1193880	1196240	Yeah, it only came out in Europe.
1196240	1197720	I didn't give two shits about it, so...
1197720	1198720	Alright, well fair enough.
1198720	1199720	Okay, so...
1199720	1201240	So, I mean, I'm the wrong person to ask.
1201240	1202240	Alright, fine.
1202240	1204880	So you didn't give a shit about the game, and so Loki and I, I'm assuming you never
1204880	1205880	played the first Manhunt.
1205880	1207080	I never really played the first Manhunt.
1207080	1210680	I've got it on PlayStation, PS2, if you ever want to borrow it.
1210680	1212200	No, I could have that too.
1212200	1213480	It doesn't have the Wii-mote.
1213480	1216400	I can't actually pretend I am chopping wieners off and whatever.
1216400	1220400	I can slice people across their abdomen in Trauma Center and that's rewarding.
1220400	1221840	Okay, good point.
1221840	1223320	Okay, here's the thing.
1223320	1224320	Here's the thing.
1224320	1228800	Okay, so it's rated AO for the Wii, because you're simulating murder in that.
1228800	1231860	Why is the PlayStation 2 unrated AO as well?
1231860	1233260	That makes no sense to me.
1233260	1238680	You're not simulating murder with the Wii-mote, so that factors out of it, and that was their
1238680	1243700	reasoning behind it, saying, oh, this is why it deserves an AO rating instead of mature.
1243700	1247520	So now you're just kind of went completely against that and said, oh, well, actually
1247520	1251960	because we hate Take-Two and Rockstar, and we want to make an example of them.
1251960	1253440	That's what it really is.
1253440	1254440	Chat comments.
1254440	1256160	We have a shitload of people in chat tonight.
1256160	1258960	Thank you guys for making our chat room a huge success tonight.
1258960	1262880	Morrie says, would this have been made into as much of a big deal if it was being developed
1262880	1267000	by someone besides Take-Two who didn't have to deal with the whole hot coffee thing?
1267000	1270120	I say yes, because I don't think this has anything to do with Take-Two, but the gaming
1270120	1272160	industry in general, personally.
1272160	1274400	I think it does have to do with Take-Two.
1274400	1275400	Look at it.
1275400	1276400	Look at Bully.
1276400	1277400	Look at Manhunt 2.
1277400	1280800	People were protesting that game before they even saw screenshots of it.
1280800	1287640	After applied to Black Devil RX, necks can have orifices if you have a tracheotomy or
1287640	1288720	you cut someone's head off.
1288720	1291080	What was the comment?
1291080	1293240	There was a comment about neck rape on there.
1293240	1294240	Oh, interesting.
1294240	1297080	I also want to read another comment from Black Devil RX.
1297080	1298680	Adults only is a stupid rating.
1298680	1299840	There's no need for it.
1299840	1303600	It should be more like an NC-17 thing, because right now they're saying that adults aren't
1303600	1307600	mature, which is the rating below AO.
1307600	1311480	That's my whole problem with it, is that I actually don't have a problem with this game
1311480	1312600	being rated AO.
1312600	1316200	It probably should be, as should some other games that are out there on the market that
1316200	1317400	came out with an M rating.
1317400	1320300	I don't have a problem with these games being rated AO.
1320300	1322300	They are for adults only.
1322300	1323300	Kids should not be playing these games.
1323300	1328200	I have a problem with society's response to the AO rating.
1328200	1331160	It's the same thing with the NC-17 rating.
1331160	1337560	The NC-17 rating in movies is like the kiss of death, whereas personally, if I had a kid,
1337560	1342020	I would much rather they see a movie like Showgirls that has a little nudity and sex
1342020	1348080	in it than a movie like Hostel or Hostel Part 2, which had a lower rating.
1348080	1350880	It's just a little sex, but then again, that might not be a fair comparison, because we're
1350880	1352860	talking about sex versus violence.
1352860	1353860	We're here with Manhunt.
1353860	1354860	It's all violence.
1354860	1361240	Well, it's just like with a lot of the ratings on these games and stuff, Grand Theft Auto.
1361240	1362240	There's a perfect example.
1362240	1363240	San Andreas.
1363240	1367200	That game had a bunch of murdering and killing of people and stuff, but oh my god, show a
1367200	1370980	little bit of digital booby and boom, AO.
1370980	1375360	See double fucking standards right there.
1375360	1377520	I don't even know what the problem is with these people.
1377520	1383840	Okay, granted, it is an adult-only game, and mature I would think pretty much satisfies
1383840	1390680	that, because 17 and older, 18 and older, I think between 17 and 18, for the most part,
1390680	1392960	people are maturing that much.
1392960	1397520	I think at 17, you probably know right and wrong about as much as you do when you're
1397520	1398520	18.
1398520	1403000	I think the dividing line of maturity is when you start paying your own bills.
1403000	1405400	That's actually a really good point.
1405400	1406400	That's a good point.
1406400	1409280	I know a lot of people in their 20s that live with mommy and daddy that aren't as mature
1409280	1410480	as some people I know that would be out at 17.
1410480	1417400	I don't understand why they don't just have M as the cap off for that, or you just leave
1417400	1418400	it at M.
1418400	1419400	Here's the thing.
1419400	1421720	I don't want to drag this topic on too long, because it's been debated to death all week,
1421720	1426480	but I do want to get one other thought out here, and that would be about how, and I'm
1426480	1431200	getting a private message from Brad from Pod Culture saying, actually, games should use
1431200	1434240	the same rating system as movies that would make things easier to understand.
1434240	1435840	It's how they did in Europe.
1435840	1439520	I think to an extent that's what they kind of tried to do with the ESRB is I think they
1439520	1443080	tried to copy the movie ratings without copying them.
1443080	1448480	So I think an M rating is supposed to be like R, no one under 17 admitted without parent
1448480	1450960	or guardian, and same thing.
1450960	1455200	They would sell you a game as long as your mommy or daddy is there with you and the clerk
1455200	1456480	says what's in the game.
1456480	1461920	But AO is like NC17, no one under 17 admitted period, parents or not.
1461920	1464760	This is just not an acceptable thing.
1464760	1467640	That would be, I think, the thing with the AO rating.
1467640	1469800	This game is not sold to anyone over 18.
1469800	1470800	It's like cigarettes.
1470800	1471800	You do not sell it under any circumstances.
1471800	1474420	Well, it's just like the M-rated games.
1474420	1479600	Those are not intended to be played by kids that are under 17.
1479600	1483560	So it is, in a sense, like the NC17.
1483560	1487600	It's just people don't treat it that way and then until someone goes and murders somebody
1487600	1489720	then they're all, oh my God, it was the game's fault.
1489720	1491560	I had no idea.
1491560	1493200	All right.
1493200	1494480	Well I guess that's that.
1494480	1498140	If you'd like to comment on this, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com would be the place
1498140	1502040	to send those emails and we've got to move on though because there was actually other
1502040	1503820	stuff that happened in the gaming world this week.
1503820	1507700	It was hard to find it amongst all the Manhunt 2 news but there was some other stuff going
1507700	1508700	on, right, Loki?
1508700	1509700	Yes.
1509700	1511700	In fact, some interesting stuff.
1511700	1515480	This has kind of been a trend with Microsoft right now, securing a lot of exclusive rights
1515480	1521000	of things, one of which being Grand Theft Auto 4 episodic content.
1521000	1527420	Apparently they've spent $50 million in securing this episodic content, which to me that seems
1527420	1534000	like an awful lot of money to spend to secure content for a game that's downloadable.
1534000	1539560	I would be very interested if there are some announcements at E3 or something.
1539560	1543800	I was thinking that maybe they're going to announce that it's going to be an Xbox 360
1543800	1547940	exclusive for the game because that's quite a bit of money that they're throwing at them,
1547940	1550980	but whatever, either way.
1550980	1556100	So if you own the 360, you're going to be able to download the episodic content in about
1556100	1560900	two batches, one of which is supposed to hit mid next year and then the rest at the end
1560900	1566340	of next year, so $25 million for each.
1566340	1570080	I think honestly though, I heard this broken down brilliantly.
1570080	1571480	I can't remember where I heard it.
1571480	1575440	I want to say our buddies at All Games Interactive, when I was listening to them on Monday waiting
1575440	1579920	to go on the air, I heard something like this and that would be that they're going to make
1579920	1583900	money on this, they're going to make a lot of money on this because Grand Theft Auto
1583900	1586800	4 will sell millions of copies.
1586800	1588960	Let's say they sell, what is it?
1588960	1592640	Let's say they sell 5 million copies of the game, at least, on Xbox 360.
1592640	1596000	They sell 5 million copies of the game and people are going to download this, let's say
1596000	1600340	they charge $10 for the episodic content, they're going to make their $50 million back
1600340	1601340	right there.
1601340	1604320	Now granted, I'm assuming that everybody's going to buy it, which isn't going to happen,
1604320	1608140	but I'm only considering one piece of downloadable content for $10.
1608140	1611280	If they release three pieces of downloadable content for $10, they'll more than make their
1611280	1613240	money back and then some.
1613240	1617080	Plus, they have something that Sony doesn't, which in the end might move some consoles
1617080	1620720	and so on and so on because I know people that are holding out for this game, Game 360.
1620720	1625560	Plus, gamer picks and themes and all sorts of crap that they can market using Grand Theft
1625560	1626560	Auto.
1626560	1628560	There you go.
1628560	1636520	You know what, to be honest, I'm not too surprised that they're actually doing this because the
1636520	1643680	PlayStation Network so far, downloadable content for games has been almost nonexistent.
1643680	1646800	Just to clear this up, because I'm still a little unsure on this, because I seem to remember
1646800	1650600	when this game was first announced, they said, okay, the PlayStation 3 is going to have this
1650600	1655000	downloadable content and the Xbox 360 will have this different downloadable content.
1655000	1660720	Microsoft is basically paid to stop the PlayStation 3 exclusive content from coming out at all.
1660720	1662720	I think so.
1662720	1664160	Interesting.
1664160	1669640	I guess that's why they did it, to try and move some more systems and get people, because
1669640	1673200	the game will be that much more on the 360.
1673200	1675520	This isn't the first game that they were doing this.
1675520	1679640	In fact, now they're saying that a beautiful Katamari is going to be a 360 exclusive as
1679640	1680640	well.
1680640	1682600	No, who knows about that.
1682600	1687140	GS191 says something interesting, the three items for download, a gun, a car, and a sex
1687140	1689060	mini game.
1689060	1690980	It's not going to be stupid shit like that.
1690980	1695880	It's going to be actual episodic, brand new storylines and stuff like that.
1695880	1698760	Not like you get a brand new gun.
1698760	1702800	Black Boy says Take Two is actually talking about selling 10 million units by the end
1702800	1703800	of 2008.
1703800	1708120	I don't know amongst what systems, because you're going to have your Sony fanboys and
1708120	1712600	people that bought the PlayStation 3 over the Xbox 360 during last year's Christmas
1712600	1716120	craze that don't really give a shit about the downloadable content.
1716120	1718320	They just want the game and all that.
1718320	1723320	I think there's a chunk of that 10 million that's going to stay on Sony's side.
1723320	1724320	We shall see.
1724320	1731880	Well, speaking of downloadable content, Eidos UK has said that the Tomb Raider anniversary
1731880	1740520	for Xbox 360 is going to be available as a series of downloads in conjunction with Tomb
1740520	1742960	Raider Legend.
1742960	1752240	Basically you're downloading each of them as different parts of the game, with free
1752240	1757920	downloads being Lara's Manor, all that type of stuff.
1757920	1763480	However, each of these episodes are going to be about $30 apiece, 2,400 Microsoft points.
1763480	1768280	I wouldn't suppose there will be a downloadable topless Lara patch like there was on the PC
1768280	1769280	versions.
1769280	1770280	No.
1770280	1773560	That's most unfortunate.
1773560	1776240	They're saying that the first two are going to be available in September.
1776240	1777240	Wow.
1777240	1779840	I don't know though, I kind of don't care about Tomb Raider anymore.
1779840	1784720	I played that Tomb Raider game on the 360, I don't even remember what it was called,
1784720	1788400	the retail release that came out a few months ago, I didn't really dig it, kind of over
1788400	1789400	Lara Croft.
1789400	1793520	Yeah, I haven't really cared about her since you could throw her off the balcony in Tomb
1793520	1796440	Raider II and break her neck and do the exploding code.
1796440	1797940	It was kind of fun to kill her off.
1797940	1802200	And lock her butler in the lock-in freezer.
1802200	1803200	Could you really do that?
1803200	1804200	Yes, you could.
1804200	1806000	That's the only way you could keep him from following you.
1806000	1807000	All right.
1807000	1811120	Well, while those downloadable contents will be out in September, there's plenty of games
1811120	1812240	coming out before then.
1812240	1816080	We're going to travel around the world and cover some upcoming release dates.
1816080	1819960	And what better way to start it off than listen to me horribly butcher some Japanese game
1819960	1822160	names of the stuff that's coming out soon.
1822160	1826720	On the Xbox 360 on June 28th, Project Silpheed is coming out.
1826720	1832320	It's actually going to the Asian regions, not just Japan.
1832320	1837760	A Donkey Kong Bongo Blast and Taru Jet Race is coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June
1837760	1838760	28th.
1838760	1843480	I believe that is the Bongo-less Bongo game because you have the Wiimotes.
1843480	1845440	Kind of fun, interesting.
1845440	1851500	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Marvel Ultimate Alliance finally hits Japan on June 28th.
1851500	1855600	And also you can get Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas in the Japanese region on that same
1855600	1858480	day, all coming out on June 28th.
1858480	1863160	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, a game called Baroque from Sting.
1863160	1868520	A special edition of Devil May Cry 3, but that's just a price reduction really.
1868520	1872280	Also an earlier version of Dragon Quest goes into the Ultimate Hits collection.
1872280	1875680	I believe this is one of the side quest stories.
1875680	1881120	Actually a special edition thing for Devil May Cry 3, I believe is the one that they
1881120	1885560	released over here where it was the greatest hits, but they also added an additional playable
1885560	1888600	character and additional difficulties.
1888600	1892720	This is a reduction for a Dragon Quest 8 spin-off story that was on the PlayStation 2, and I
1892720	1893720	don't remember this game being here.
1893720	1896860	I don't know if they have reported this over here, perhaps somebody else in our chatroom
1896860	1898560	knows a little more about that game.
1898560	1899560	No.
1899560	1902120	Now I don't think that game ever came out here, because that's because the game is way
1902120	1903740	bigger over in Japan.
1903740	1909960	Also coming out, Metal Slug on the PlayStation 2, yes, moving into the best hits.
1909960	1910960	What?
1910960	1911960	What?
1911960	1912960	What?
1912960	1913960	What?
1913960	1915680	I love Metal Slug.
1915680	1918240	I'll kill you.
1918240	1925560	Let's see, also coming out on June 28th in Japan, Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra.
1925560	1926560	What?
1926560	1928600	Excuse me, what?
1928600	1933400	Why do they keep putting out games for that anime that's been, what, 10 years gone now?
1933400	1934400	Because people buy them.
1934400	1936280	The ones on Saturn sucked.
1936280	1938840	The one on Nintendo 64 sucked.
1938840	1940440	Why do they keep doing it?
1940440	1946240	Tales of Fandom Volume 2 coming out from Namco Bandai on June 28th, also on the PlayStation
1946240	1947240	2.
1947240	1951880	Taito Memories, also known as Eternal Hits, coming out in two versions.
1951880	1955960	That's Gekkan and Jukkan, and I believe that's very similar to what we have over here as
1955960	1960800	the Taito Greatest Hits collection, the comparable thing we have here already in America.
1960800	1965200	Also coming out in Japan, The King of Fighters XI moving into the best hits collection on
1965200	1966200	the 28th.
1966200	1970320	That's in case moving a lot of stuff into best hits on PlayStation 2.
1970320	1976520	Quickly checking the handheld systems, Kuri Kuri DS is coming out on June 28th.
1976520	1978320	Otasuke Island.
1978320	1983880	This looks like one of those cute little chibi games, I don't know, it's an action game.
1983880	1988560	Looks like with bunnies and an angry pink bunny sailing a ship.
1988560	1991940	That's what I can tell from the box art, because I don't bother to read up on what these games
1991940	1993240	are really about.
1993240	1998840	Konami is releasing a game over in Japan on the DS called Otona no Joryoku Kentai, which
1998840	2001880	looks like a game with sexy ladies.
2001880	2006680	Looks like another dating sim type game, I'm not sure what this is.
2006680	2009560	Looks like another dating sim type game, we'll just call it that.
2009560	2013880	And let's see, also coming out, I'm just checking real quick to see what's coming out on the
2013880	2015840	PSP.
2015840	2017480	Lots of releases here on June 28th.
2017480	2026080	Ratchet & Clank gets its PSP release on June 28th, and just for Jamie, Secret of Evangelion
2026080	2031960	Portable coming out on the 28th.
2031960	2032960	That's it!
2032960	2041200	I wish it was all Neon Genesis over here too, that would have been funny, but it's not.
2041200	2047040	So anyways, next week there's a ton of releases, a lot of them coming out based on movies,
2047040	2050360	one of which is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, that's going to be coming
2050360	2058800	out on almost everything, PlayStation 2, PSP, 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii, PSP, and
2058800	2062240	I believe DS also.
2062240	2066720	Then of course Ratatouille, that's going to be coming out on almost everything, PlayStation
2066720	2074880	2, GameCube, PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii, DS, and PSP.
2074880	2080400	Now Transformers, that's going to be coming out on all the console systems, so that'll
2080400	2082040	be pretty cool.
2082040	2089000	And then on the Wii, we've got Pokemon Battle Revolution, so that's pretty slick.
2089000	2095080	The Biggs is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PlayStation 3, and 360, kind of like
2095080	2098320	an arcade style baseball game.
2098320	2102040	Grim Grimoire is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, that one's supposed to be pretty
2102040	2103680	good.
2103680	2109760	Also on PSP, just this small little game called Final Fantasy is going to be coming out as
2109760	2110760	well.
2110760	2112320	What's that game about?
2112320	2113320	I've never heard of it.
2113320	2116800	I don't know, but I hear it's kind of a Japanese style game.
2116800	2117800	Oh, then never mind.
2117800	2120440	I don't know if I'll be playing that, but never mind.
2120440	2125320	Then of course, this is actually something I'm interested in, TracksPad, it's kind
2125320	2131600	of a portable music studio type thing, so I'm going to be picking that up, maybe make
2131600	2133960	some music with that.
2133960	2139280	And then on 360 also, we had Hour of Victory coming out, Overlord, it's making its way
2139280	2145960	out here, and on PlayStation 3, hopefully, Rainbow Six Vegas, because that thing's
2145960	2150520	been delayed so many freaking times.
2150520	2152160	And I believe that's it.
2152160	2153480	I have some stuff.
2153480	2156120	Alright, who's release dates do you have?
2156120	2157720	These are the UK release dates.
2157720	2163480	On the 26th, we have Cosmic Family for Wii, and Harry Potter and the Odor of Phoenix.
2163480	2165920	Sorry, Odor.
2165920	2172680	And then a bunch of crap on the 29th, we have Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars on PSP, I love Crazy
2172680	2180600	Taxi, Driver Parallel Lines, Final Fantasy 6 Advance, which I already have in my purse,
2180600	2185660	Hour of Victory, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition, more brain training from Dr. Kalashima, How
2185660	2189880	Old is Your Brain?, Project Silpheed, I want Project Silpheed!
2189880	2190880	Sorry.
2190880	2191880	Few more weeks.
2191880	2193880	Few more weeks.
2193880	2198960	No, you have no idea, I played the shit out of Silpheed on the Sega CD.
2198960	2200680	Second week in July.
2200680	2206520	When I saw the thing for Project Silpheed, I about crapped my pants or something, I don't
2206520	2207520	care.
2207520	2208520	Oops, I crapped my pants.
2208520	2209520	Oops, I crapped my pants.
2209520	2211160	I was all like, Silpheed, pretty.
2211160	2214360	Did you make that little moaning noise that you made earlier?
2214360	2217080	That made the chat room go, oh really?
2217080	2223240	Anyway, Puzzle League DS, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, which I hear is absolutely really
2223240	2231920	awesome, Super Stardust HD on Playstation 3, Tenchu Z, The Darkness, sounds like a bad
2231920	2240320	fan fiction, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas,
2240320	2246360	Vampire Reign, Agon Lost Swords of Toledo, is that like Ohio?
2246360	2247360	Is this Toledo?
2247360	2248360	Is that Ohio?
2248360	2254840	Okay, we're going to Ohio to look for the sword, and Eye of Shit, I mean Eye of Judgment.
2254840	2255840	What the?
2255840	2256840	Wait, Eye of Judgment?
2256840	2257840	Wait, no, no, no.
2257840	2258840	PlayStation 3.
2258840	2260840	Aw, something's gotta be screwed up with that calendar.
2260840	2261840	29th.
2261840	2262840	Really?
2262840	2263840	Yep.
2263840	2264840	What?
2264840	2265840	That's a bit early, it seems.
2265840	2266840	It does.
2266840	2267840	And Steel Horizons.
2267840	2272640	I was going to say, there's a few that I missed for the U.S. Darkness, which isn't just a
2272640	2275320	fan fiction, I hope you know.
2275320	2280880	It's actually a Top Cow comic, I believe, I thought it was published by Image as well,
2280880	2282880	being made into a live action movie as well.
2282880	2288840	It's kind of like a cross between demonic possession and a mafia story type thing, basically
2288840	2291800	rip people apart with demons.
2291800	2293520	And what was the other one?
2293520	2296400	Oh, Driver Parallel Lines for the Wii, but you know, you probably don't want to pick
2296400	2299200	that one up anyways, so.
2299200	2300200	Darkness.
2300200	2305880	Isn't that a cliche thing to call your game or whatever, Darkness, I don't know.
2305880	2310400	But that's the name of the comic book series, the Darkness.
2310400	2312600	It's the demonic thing that possessed him.
2312600	2315280	Alright, anything else, Dark Sakura for our UK listeners?
2315280	2316280	Your mom!
2316280	2317280	Really?
2317280	2318560	What platform is she coming out on?
2318560	2320640	The Last Knight platform.
2320640	2322480	I hate you.
2322480	2325680	Going over to the Virtual Console, I know a lot of you kids like to download the old
2325680	2330160	school classics on the Wii Virtual Console, and leave it to the ESRB to blow some more
2330160	2332440	ideas on titles that are coming out.
2332440	2336560	Shining Force is coming out for the Sega Genesis soon.
2336560	2340080	Super Turrican and Super Turrican 2 soon.
2340080	2344640	But most interesting of all, a game called Dr. Mario Wii.
2344640	2348640	Now you'll notice that the Wii, now people don't really know what this is, if this is
2348640	2353120	like a typo, if they just meant to put Dr. Mario and they put like the Wii or whatever
2353120	2358840	is in there, or if this is actually like a whole new game, hmm, wouldn't that be something,
2358840	2362520	a whole new game based on Dr. Mario?
2362520	2363520	That sounds like fun to me.
2363520	2367000	I would be really impressed if it were SNK, but unfortunately...
2367000	2371480	I don't think it would be, seeing as Dr. Mario is a Nintendo license.
2371480	2375280	No, I'm talking about the whole new game part.
2375280	2376280	Alright.
2376280	2380260	Alright, well that's pretty much it, so be on the lookout for that, and hopefully that
2380260	2382520	Dr. Mario Wii thing is a new thing.
2382520	2387840	You know, in my mind, if that is something new, that would be the perfect thing to release
2387840	2389560	the week of E3.
2389560	2390560	Mark my words.
2390560	2392500	Dr. Mario Wii.
2392500	2393740	It's a start.
2393740	2397240	It's not, you know, probably a game that a lot of us are going to get super duper excited
2397240	2398520	about, but it's a start.
2398520	2400440	It's something we don't have yet.
2400440	2401440	You know what I mean?
2401440	2404640	It's something new being made for the Wii, if that makes any sense.
2404640	2406680	It's better than everybody votes channel, okay?
2406680	2408940	Let's just leave it at that.
2408940	2412100	Everybody votes channel!
2412100	2413960	Everybody votes to change this channel.
2413960	2416360	I fucking hate that channel, by the way.
2416360	2419120	Just completely useless.
2419120	2425800	Anyways, so, interesting rumor, kind of also associated with Nintendo here.
2425800	2433160	That would be that they will be licensing their properties to be made into games onto
2433160	2437720	the Apple iPhone.
2437720	2442160	I don't know if anyone remembers, back in the day, there was a certain platform which
2442160	2446640	they licensed their games to be made onto.
2446640	2452480	Yeah, CDI games didn't turn out very well.
2452480	2458600	But apparently, they're supposed to be coming out on the iPhone, priced at about $29 each.
2458600	2465860	So is $29 worth paying for a downloadable game that's going to be probably a remake
2465860	2467840	of Mario Brothers?
2467840	2468840	I don't know.
2468840	2470480	Sounds more like a rumor to me.
2470480	2474040	Okay, the most interesting thing about this story, like, I could kind of care less about
2474040	2475040	the game.
2475040	2477920	I personally am not interested in the iPhone, but I have a lot of friends who are, like,
2477920	2481400	doing the campout thing and all that crap to get this stupid phone.
2481400	2484760	Not my thing, but I don't have $600 to burn.
2484760	2486300	For those that want it, hey, good for you.
2486300	2488320	Can I have a loan?
2488320	2493520	But the point behind this story, Yuri Lover in chat sums it up perfectly, OMG, Nintendo
2493520	2495120	and Apple are in bed together.
2495120	2499280	I mean, this is what the fanboys wanted, like, years ago.
2499280	2504200	They kept saying, gee, Nintendo likes to put cute things out, Apple likes to put cute things
2504200	2508320	out in different colors, just like Nintendo, why aren't these companies in bed together?
2508320	2513780	And here they go, there's a little foreplay going on here with this story, right?
2513780	2514780	Is this foreplay?
2514780	2517320	I think it's just a rumor, to be honest.
2517320	2518480	You think this is just bullshit?
2518480	2522720	I think this is bullshit, but it wouldn't surprise me that they're going to try to
2522720	2526680	whore themselves out and it wouldn't surprise me that stupid morons that pay $600 for a
2526680	2531400	fucking phone would pay $30 for downloadable content on said phone.
2531400	2535620	Geniuses that buy this shit, so, way to go.
2535620	2538440	You know what, maybe you should go purchase a Playstation 3 while you're at it, since
2538440	2542360	you didn't have all this excess money to throw around.
2542360	2543800	Are you just mad because you're poor?
2543800	2545680	No, I don't want this fucking phone.
2545680	2548840	I would not pay $600 for a goddamn phone.
2548840	2553600	So anyway, for anyone who is one of our friends in the UK, they just got a big treat on the
2553600	2555480	Virtual Console.
2555480	2556480	Guess what's out?
2556480	2557480	Mega Man!
2557480	2559240	Um, your mom, oh.
2559240	2561560	No, my mom doesn't put out for me.
2561560	2563560	Mega Mom.
2563560	2570020	Mega Man just made it out for 500 Wii points, and from Turbografx-16 China Warriors is another
2570020	2571320	new one on there.
2571320	2579440	They are both games from 1989, but, um, dude, I'm just excited about Mega Man, because,
2579440	2581920	you know, all the Mega Man 2, though, was really the better game.
2581920	2584360	Mega Man, though, was really cool.
2584360	2585960	Is one of the ones that has beaten.
2585960	2590640	I like Mega Man and all, but what about, you know, the whole Mega Man collection that was
2590640	2593080	on GameCube and the Wii's backwards compatible, you know?
2593080	2594080	Do people care?
2594080	2595080	Yeah, me.
2595080	2597720	I'm not gonna spend money on the Virtual Console Mega Man when that game's out there.
2597720	2600500	Well, neither am I. I mean, I have the freaking cartridge.
2600500	2604760	By the way, I can't lend you one of my Nintendos, but that's another story.
2604760	2610480	Um, but, you know, but for people who may not have bought the collection or may just
2610480	2614960	say, oh, well, that's pretty cool, Mega Man, they might want to get it, so.
2614960	2617320	So in other words, for lazy people who are one-click shoppers.
2617320	2618320	Yeah.
2618320	2619320	Alright, there you go.
2619320	2620320	Very good.
2620320	2621320	Very good.
2621320	2622320	Then carry on.
2622320	2623320	And talk to me later about the Nintendo.
2623320	2624320	Carry on one-click.
2624320	2625320	Did you say you can borrow it?
2625320	2626320	I have, like, three.
2626320	2627320	You can borrow one.
2627320	2628320	Sweet!
2628320	2629320	I thought you said you can't.
2629320	2630320	No.
2630320	2632720	I'm totally gonna get a copy of Guardian Legend for myself.
2632720	2634720	You can borrow mine, too, if you want.
2634720	2635720	Awesomeness.
2635720	2636720	I'm not playing it.
2636720	2638720	I can only tear myself away from World of Warcraft.
2638720	2645920	There are free, easier methods to, you know, obtain Guardian Legends to play it on a console.
2645920	2647240	It's not the same.
2647240	2648240	It's not the same.
2648240	2649240	I can't explain it.
2649240	2650240	It's not the same.
2650240	2652000	Those little imperfections bug me.
2652000	2656000	There's something rewarding about blowing on the cartridge and putting it in the machine
2656000	2658300	and it'll finally work at some point.
2658300	2659300	I don't know.
2659300	2660880	I'm not talking about that.
2660880	2664180	Hopefully there's a lot of rewards from this game as well or else there's gonna be a lot
2664180	2668360	of people that are pissed off because Spore, which you might remember was my favorite game
2668360	2672400	I saw at last year's E3, well, I'm gonna be waiting a long frickin' time to play this
2672400	2680500	game, as are all of you, because this game has been pushed back to the fiscal year 2009.
2680500	2686400	That means that it will, at earliest, come out in April of 2008.
2686400	2691480	Now some folks were, you know, this game was already supposed to be out, then it got pushed
2691480	2694880	back to this fiscal year, then it got pushed back to next fiscal year, then it was like,
2694880	2698840	oh, it's gonna come out by the Christmas, oh, it's gonna come out first quarter 2008,
2698840	2704680	here we go again, it just got delayed to April 2008 at the earliest.
2704680	2708520	And it's so weird because when, you know, when we saw the demo, I was like, this game
2708520	2710400	looks like it's almost done.
2710400	2711400	The game looks great.
2711400	2715360	I mean, maybe that's why they only showed us one element of the game, you know, maybe
2715360	2718760	looks can be deceiving, but I don't know.
2718760	2722120	It's just it's a massive game and they want to make sure they get it right, that's all.
2722120	2724880	For a change, yay!
2724880	2729840	Gerardimo calls this game in our chat room Spore Forever, a little play on Duke Nukem
2729840	2730840	Forever, get it?
2730840	2736360	Yeah, but at least we've actually seen screenshots and like, you know, playable Spore, like,
2736360	2739940	you know, because they show, I mean, even though you weren't able to play the demo yourself,
2739940	2746240	they did kind of like a, you know, a user-assisted tutorial type thing at E3 and it looked, it
2746240	2747240	looked pretty awesome.
2747240	2751360	I mean, it was awesome enough to get me the most excited over any other game I saw at
2751360	2752360	E3 last year.
2752360	2753960	It looked awesome.
2753960	2757040	But nevertheless, I am pissed off about the fact that this game is delayed.
2757040	2762120	I don't know how Loki and Dark Sakura feel, but since I'm at the soundboard and I'm angry
2762120	2775600	enough, I push the button and out come the FUs.
2775600	2777160	Dark Sakura, start us off.
2777160	2780320	Um, FU to life.
2780320	2781320	I'm sorry to hear that.
2781320	2782320	That's it?
2782320	2783320	Yeah.
2783320	2786720	But that's a good blanket FU to kind of encompass everything.
2786720	2790560	Oh yeah, because there's a whole bunch of shit going on, so FU to all of it.
2790560	2791560	Sorry to hear that.
2791560	2798960	Uh, once again, I would like to repeat my distaste for street smart cool cat.
2798960	2805320	That fucking idiot can die in a fire and I hope your game sucks balls and does not sell
2805320	2806560	one piece.
2806560	2810640	It is horrible and you need to stop.
2810640	2816320	I would like to say FU to Bobby Blackwell for correcting me in chat saying dude knew
2816320	2821600	them forever was playable at E3 1998 on the Quake 2 engine.
2821600	2827840	FU Bobby and your old show 100 weeks, whatever.
2827840	2828840	Just kidding.
2828840	2829840	I heart Bobby.
2829840	2836720	I also want to say a big FU to the DMV because I have to go there tomorrow and nobody likes
2836720	2840040	going to the DMV because I have to get my license renewed because my birthday is coming
2840040	2843880	up and I got to get that all taken care of before my birthday or else I won't have a
2843880	2844880	driver's license.
2844880	2850720	FU to the possibility I may not have a driver's license.
2850720	2851720	That's it.
2851720	2856840	Anyways, so there's something actually pretty cool coming out of the homebrew scene and
2856840	2863000	that is a sequel, a homebrew sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog and it actually looks pretty
2863000	2864000	cool.
2864000	2872200	The name of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog XG or Extended Genesis and pretty much captures
2872200	2877100	the original Sonic the Hedgehog game series very accurately.
2877100	2883080	It's scheduled to have 10 unique zones, 18 acts along with his secret zone after Chaos
2883080	2891600	Central and no word though on what it's coming out on, I would assume PC, but pretty
2891600	2892600	awesome.
2892600	2896320	They have a video on Destructoid if you want to check it out.
2896320	2897320	Really cool looking game.
2897320	2901320	Not even really a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog series.
2901320	2906480	Hopefully it gets released and you can download it before Sega's lawyers get on them.
2906480	2908920	Oh, that would be nice.
2908920	2915240	Well, other Sonic news that I think is actually kind of cool is BioWare is doing a Sonic RPG
2915240	2916720	that's going to be on the Nintendo DS.
2916720	2919600	It's supposed to be out in 2008.
2919600	2926120	There's not a whole bunch out on it, but it's just saying that Sega is standing behind
2926120	2930080	what BioWare has planned doing and BioWare wants to do it, blah, blah, blah.
2930080	2931800	So I hope it's good.
2931800	2932800	It could be.
2932800	2937720	You know, they did good stuff for what, didn't they do Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic,
2937720	2938720	so...
2938720	2944040	And the upcoming Mass Effect game, which is going to be like one of the best role playing
2944040	2945560	games for the 360.
2945560	2946760	You hope.
2946760	2947760	It looks...
2947760	2948760	It does look pretty frickin' amazing.
2948760	2949760	Amazing.
2949760	2950760	Look at that.
2950760	2956000	Every time I hear about this, I think about the Mario RPG for some sick reason.
2956000	2959320	I mean, because you know, Squeenix helped to make, well, it was just Square back then,
2959320	2963880	but Squaresoft made the Mario RPG game, and that was like a top of the line developer,
2963880	2967960	especially back at that time at the... I remember Final Fantasy was like all the rage
2967960	2969800	at that point.
2969800	2974240	Just kind of interesting that now you have this BioWare who's kind of like also an A-list
2974240	2976160	developer kind of making this Sonic RPG.
2976160	2979600	I just hope it doesn't blow chunks like all the other Sonic games that have come out in
2979600	2980600	the past three years.
2980600	2981600	My thoughts exactly.
2981600	2986240	And you know, that makes me also pissed off because remember there was, I think, Square
2986240	2989640	Enix was saying that they wanted to dedicate themselves to the Nintendo platforms.
2989640	2992280	Make me another goddamn Super Mario RPG.
2992280	2996660	Since you've dedicated yourself to the Nintendo platforms, why don't you make yourself useful
2996660	3002680	and do that instead of making another fuckin' sequel to Final Fantasy VII.
3002680	3003960	It's a BlackDevilRX in chat.
3003960	3008320	It says, Sega and BioWare are in bed... We have a lot of in bed stories tonight.
3008320	3009320	What's up with that?
3009320	3010320	Go figure.
3010320	3013480	Before we get to the next story, I actually want to share this comment.
3013480	3017160	BlackBoy, thank you buddy, who actually was featured on GayGamer.net this week, by the
3017160	3018160	way, I noticed.
3018160	3019160	Congratulations to you, BlackBoy.
3019160	3024680	He actually sent me a link that contests the whole Spore is Delayed story that we just
3024680	3025680	reported on.
3025680	3030600	Apparently, another website picked this up, NextGen.biz, a pretty popular site for gaming
3030600	3035620	news, picked up that actually there's a little bit of misinformation going on with that story.
3035620	3039320	They already announced a long time ago that the game was going to be delayed to the next
3039320	3043920	fiscal year, but some people were picking up this story, and for some reason saying
3043920	3048460	that the fiscal year 2009 meant April 2009, which isn't the case.
3048460	3054120	We did say that meant April 2008, but EA wants to tell you that's not nothing new.
3054120	3061600	There's a quote here from... This comes from John Riccitello, CEO, says, quote, there seems
3061600	3064280	to be some misinformation flying around.
3064280	3068420	Nothing's changed since our call on May 8th, where John Riccitello specifically said that
3068420	3074660	we were moving Spore from fiscal 08 to early fiscal 09.
3074660	3077520	Maybe that Spore thing wasn't news after all, but I'm still angsty about it.
3077520	3078680	That's a long time to wait.
3078680	3081000	I actually still was thinking it was coming out Christmas this year.
3081000	3083040	I somehow missed the boat on that story.
3083040	3084040	Go figure.
3084040	3086280	Nevertheless, thanks for the corrections.
3086280	3091560	We report on what's big on the gaming blogs out there and what catches our eye, and we're
3091560	3095840	not always going to be 100% on target, but we try to get close.
3095840	3098800	Hopefully, this is accurate, because this is something trying to foresee things a little
3098800	3099800	bit.
3099800	3106120	This would be the list of Halo 3 achievements coming to you, thanks to Xbox360achievements.org.
3106120	3108800	For those of you that are achievement point whores, Loki...
3108800	3110840	I'm buying the game.
3110840	3111840	You're not buying it?
3111840	3112840	No.
3112840	3115120	You're not really a first-person shooter fan, right?
3115120	3116280	Not really a Halo fan.
3116280	3120160	If I bought it, would you want to borrow it to try and get some of the achievements?
3120160	3121160	No.
3121160	3122160	All right.
3122160	3125420	Well, for those of you that like to get your achievements and you like your Halo, you can
3125420	3129960	be looking forward to some various achievements, including basically it looks like every chapter
3129960	3134240	in the game gets its own achievement, up to nine chapters, the ninth chapter being called
3134240	3140520	Return, some achievements for when you complete the campaign on Normal, Heroic, and Legendary,
3140520	3144840	also some Hidden Skulls, looking like they claim some different achievements throughout
3144840	3145840	the game.
3145840	3150600	Then, of course, there are some various player versus player achievements, awards being given
3150600	3159780	for Triple Kill, Overkill, Headshots, and then some achievements still in question because
3159780	3164880	you actually see the achievement says score over X amount of points in the campaign meta
3164880	3170480	game on the second mission for some various achievements named such thing as Demon, Gorilla,
3170480	3176160	Vanguard, Reclaimer, so looks like about nine different achievements there, so kind of interesting.
3176160	3180400	So that's what the achievements look like for Halo 3.
3180400	3184400	Someone was asking me in chat room what my favorite all-time first-person shooter is.
3184400	3188720	TimeSplitters 2, fucking awesome game.
3188720	3195040	Anyways, let's see here.
3195040	3198320	There's some interesting developments in the whole Immersion thing.
3198320	3205440	Remember back, Immersion, of course, sued Sony over the rumble technology in their controllers.
3205440	3211520	So now we've got Microsoft suing Immersion, and the reason is apparently because the whole
3211520	3217320	Sony lawsuit, and since they settled on that, that violates some sort of agreement that
3217320	3220920	Microsoft had with Immersion when they were licensing the technology.
3220920	3226320	According to Microsoft, Microsoft licenses technology in both in and out and relies on
3226320	3229820	these agreements to be honored and enforced.
3229820	3233840	Our request to the court is that all companies and industry partners should play by the same
3233840	3237920	rules and that the binding agreement we signed with Immersion be honored.
3237920	3243740	In other words, they're suing because they settled with Sony, and basically that would
3243740	3249320	kind of say that Sony is not playing by the same rules, so I don't know.
3249320	3251320	Poor babies.
3251320	3255960	Let's pout and sue.
3255960	3260240	What exactly, somebody remind me, because I haven't really been following the details
3260240	3261240	of all these stories.
3261240	3263920	I just see the headlines and I go, oh, lawsuit, lawsuit.
3263920	3266940	What exactly has Immersion done for gaming?
3266940	3269840	They developed apparently rumble technology.
3269840	3272040	Apparently they developed rumble technology.
3272040	3274460	Well, they have trademarks, so.
3274460	3279180	But was it one of those things where like, because I remember, did they develop the first,
3279180	3282800	what is it, the Nintendo CC4 rumble pack was the first thing that had rumble, right?
3282800	3284360	Yeah, I think so.
3284360	3285720	Did they develop that?
3285720	3286720	No.
3286720	3292240	It's one of those companies that makes a patent or patents something and then sits on it until
3292240	3295760	someone makes it and then they go and sue them.
3295760	3297240	Interesting.
3297240	3302480	Because I'm like, what exactly has Immersion done besides sue people and get sued?
3302480	3303760	Like have they ever made a game?
3303760	3305840	Have they ever made a third party product?
3305840	3306840	No.
3306840	3307840	Nothing.
3307840	3308840	Interesting.
3308840	3313340	So, what a waste of everybody's time this company seems to be, unless I'm totally missing
3313340	3317280	something here, because I can't think of anything Immersion has actually done.
3317280	3321520	I'll look them up on Wikipedia during this next statement, where Dark Soccer is going
3321520	3327520	to surf the internet ups and down and all over and try to find her favorite website
3327520	3331120	of the week, and this better be a good one, because it is a special show tonight.
3331120	3338120	Dark Soccer, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?
3338120	3341600	Today's website of the week is one that should be near and dear to the hearts of anyone who
3341600	3344560	has ever gotten married.
3344560	3347520	It's UglyDress.com.
3347520	3353880	It's a dress, it shows the worst bridesmaids dresses ever with photographs.
3353880	3356480	And these are really awful.
3356480	3366280	There's one on here that looks like a flag, and I'm not even joking, it's really nasty.
3366280	3375520	And it's not just weddings either, it's ugly cakes, and ugly shoes, and tuxedos and shit.
3375520	3379160	It's really just awful, awful stuff.
3379160	3386200	There's some show that they all watch on Ventrilo in World of Warcraft, the guild, and it's
3386200	3387920	very similar to what you're talking about.
3387920	3391040	It's like, God, now I can't remember the name of the show.
3391040	3395400	It's like Fashion Emergency or something like that, or you can't wear that outside.
3395400	3396880	I can't think of the name of the show.
3396880	3399080	Loki, you're laughing, you know what I'm talking about?
3399080	3400360	I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
3400360	3423700	I don't know, but when Dark
3423700	3435280	War
3435280	3441000	Anyway, I looked up Immersion Corporation, by the way, on Wikipedia.
3441000	3445880	BlackWolf in chat came to save the day because BlackWolf knows more about gaming than I do,
3445880	3446880	apparently.
3446880	3451200	BlackWolf said, Sky, Immersion patented the technology behind the PlayStation and Xbox
3451200	3453000	Rumble technology.
3453000	3454800	And I'm looking at Wikipedia here.
3454800	3459080	Immersion Corporation of San Jose, California is a developer of Haptic Technology.
3459080	3461180	The company was founded in 1993.
3461180	3465240	Immersion's technology is employed in automotive, entertainment, medical training, mobility,
3465240	3470160	personal computing, and three-dimensional simulation applications.
3470160	3474120	Immersion's patent portfolio includes over 500 issues or pending patents in the U.S.
3474120	3475840	and other countries.
3475840	3480780	Immersion was used as an example in an article on patent trolls by Game Daily Biz.
3480780	3485200	So I guess we're not the first people to say something about that, so kudos to Game Daily
3485200	3486200	Biz.
3486200	3487880	I'm glad they have something called patent trolls.
3487880	3488880	That's kind of funny.
3488880	3490460	Thank you, Wonder Dog Herald in chat.
3490460	3493040	It's called What Not to Wear, is the name of the show.
3493040	3494200	It's called What Not to Wear.
3494200	3497720	So you should check out that show, DarkStarter, because I know you don't watch TV.
3497720	3498720	Isn't that on style?
3498720	3499720	Here's a torrent.
3499720	3500720	I don't know.
3500720	3501720	That's on Style Network.
3501720	3502720	I think so.
3502720	3503720	Why do I know this?
3503720	3504720	I don't even have that.
3504720	3506960	Because your wife probably watches it.
3506960	3509800	It totally sounds like something your wife probably watches.
3509800	3519920	All right, anyhow, just trying to get caught up on some other chat room comments here.
3519920	3525880	Saikun says, stop using us, Rob, because I guess I'm using the chat room to do research
3525880	3528760	tonight.
3528760	3530320	Let's go on to another story here.
3530320	3534140	Last week we had a fun little debate on video game addiction, which you'll remember Jamie
3534140	3536080	lost because she made fun of me.
3536080	3537520	And when you make fun of me, you instantly lose.
3537520	3538960	But I make fun of you all the time.
3538960	3539960	I know.
3539960	3540960	And so you lose all the time.
3540960	3541960	No, just kidding.
3541960	3545720	But what's interesting about this is this is a news article that was released by the
3545720	3546720	Associated Press.
3546720	3551080	So it was picked up on sites by Yahoo and CNN and some of those sites.
3551080	3555560	Video game addiction could possibly be a new diagnosis.
3555560	3559280	This is somewhat a bit of a follow-up to the article we were talking about last week.
3559280	3563680	The AMA is going to be having this meeting, and it already started in Chicago.
3563680	3567520	And the council is going to be asking the group to lobby for the disorder to be included
3567520	3572280	in a widely used mental illness manual created and published by the American Psychiatric
3572280	3575000	Association, video game addiction.
3575000	3580520	Now if this were actually happening, this could mean that possibly your insurance would
3580520	3584080	cover this as any other type of mental disorder like alcoholism.
3584080	3587800	So would they have to cover buying more games?
3587800	3591440	Because obviously I'm addicted to games, and I need that.
3591440	3592440	I can't wean myself up.
3592440	3593840	I don't think it works like that actually.
3593840	3595920	It's like the gum or something.
3595920	3600040	Most insurance companies don't cover this type of thing very well anyway, even if it
3600040	3601040	even covers it at all.
3601040	3603680	I mean, insurance companies have to cover certain mental conditions, but I don't think
3603680	3604680	this is one of them.
3604680	3608440	It's my medicinal pot because I'm stuck playing video games.
3608440	3612440	Actually insurance companies don't cover, don't ask me how I know so much about insurance,
3612440	3613440	but I do.
3613440	3619760	Insurance companies don't cover marijuana because it's not a federally recognized drug.
3619760	3621640	It's only recognized in certain states.
3621640	3625240	So your insurance company typically won't cover marijuana, just so you know.
3625240	3626480	But you can get a prescription for it.
3626480	3628200	You can in certain states.
3628200	3629200	Yes.
3629200	3630200	Including California.
3630200	3631200	And there's only certain farms that are allowed to grow it.
3631200	3635160	I'm sorry, how did we get from video game diagnosis story to pot growing?
3635160	3637200	Because we give our listeners what they want to know.
3637200	3638600	I see.
3638600	3642280	Anyway, from the story here, I want to point this out.
3642280	3648280	Joyce Protopapas of Frisco, Texas said her 17-year-old son Michael was a video game addict.
3648280	3650680	Actually, the story says a video addict.
3650680	3654440	Over nearly two years, video and internet games transformed him from an outgoing academically
3654440	3659520	gifted team into a reclusive manipulator who flunked two 10th grade classes and spent several
3659520	3664080	hours a day and night playing a popular online video game called World of Warcraft.
3664080	3669040	My father was an alcoholic and I saw exactly the same thing and Michael said, Protopapas,
3669040	3671520	we battled him until October of last year.
3671520	3672520	We went to therapists.
3672520	3674060	We tried taking the game away.
3674060	3675300	He would threaten us physically.
3675300	3677360	He would curse and call us every name imaginable.
3677360	3679360	It was if he was possessed.
3679360	3682480	And when she suggested to therapists that Michael had a video game addiction, nobody
3682480	3683520	was familiar with it.
3683520	3685140	They all pooh-poohed it.
3685140	3689760	And finally, they found a therapist and they sent Michael to a therapeutic boarding school,
3689760	3693960	$5,000 a month that the insurance didn't cover to get him kicked off the video game.
3693960	3697480	You know what my mom would have done if I flunked a class over video games?
3697480	3701980	She would have thrown the TV out a window or she actually did this once.
3701980	3707520	She took the power cord to the Nintendo so I couldn't hook it up to the TV for months
3707520	3711400	and I wasn't at the age where I could just run out and buy a new power cord because I
3711400	3713020	was only 14 when this happened.
3713020	3718240	So I couldn't hook up the Nintendo for a couple months because I was doing badly in a class.
3718240	3723280	And I realize the mom is saying that the kid was going off and threatening her physically
3723280	3724280	and all this other stuff.
3724280	3728120	But to me, that's a whole other issue that needs dealing with.
3728120	3731040	That's like just making a bad thing worse to add the whole world up thing.
3731040	3735720	I'm powerless to do anything about these video games.
3735720	3737540	Fucking bullshit is what it is.
3737540	3741460	She needs to get off her fucking drunken ass and take care of her damn kids is what she
3741460	3743680	needs to do.
3743680	3744680	I don't know.
3744680	3747720	I think it's stupid that she couldn't just take away the game system.
3747720	3748720	He's a 14-year-old.
3748720	3750920	Beat the crap out of him.
3750920	3753800	It's easy.
3753800	3754800	If she can't do it...
3754800	3756160	I don't know if I would go that far.
3756160	3759780	She should put him in one of those deprivation tanks.
3759780	3763400	It sounds like he had a lot of problems besides just video games and maybe he should have
3763400	3765380	gone to the boarding school already.
3765380	3766840	That's a good idea.
3766840	3768560	I agree with you, Rob.
3768560	3772440	Once again, you know, other problems and then because he's playing video games, obviously
3772440	3774760	the video games have a problem.
3774760	3775760	Fucking hate people.
3775760	3776760	Hold on.
3776760	3779840	Did Jamie say she agreed with me?
3779840	3780880	Oh my God.
3780880	3785800	It only took five years and finally Jamie agrees with me on something.
3785800	3787360	This is a blessed holy day.
3787360	3788360	I'm so excited.
3788360	3790080	Jamie finally agrees with me.
3790080	3793840	Is this like your present to me on this anniversary show or something?
3793840	3794840	Rob?
3794840	3795840	What?
3795840	3796840	Rob.
3796840	3797840	What?
3797840	3798840	Rob.
3798840	3799840	Rob.
3799840	3800840	I will kill you in the face.
3800840	3801840	Art, you're...
3801840	3802840	Have a jammy dodger.
3802840	3804280	I don't want a jammy dodger.
3804280	3807960	Hey, all of our Eddie Izzard fans, I bought jammy dodgers.
3807960	3810600	Will you dodger that jammy when I shove it up your ass?
3810600	3811640	Then fine.
3811640	3814940	You don't get any of the, um, stuff I bought for part B.
3814940	3817680	No, but I want the stuff you brought for part B.
3817680	3819380	The stuff I bought for part B is great.
3819380	3820380	So...
3820380	3821380	Sorry.
3821380	3823420	Some news comes from apparently a...
3823420	3824420	Oh wait.
3824420	3825420	I'm sorry.
3825420	3826420	Can I read chat comments?
3826420	3828480	chat that was a big story so I'm sorry I
3828480	3830360	was too busy fighting with Jamie I hope
3830360	3833480	you all will understand Ross deal UT
3833480	3835660	says it's a symptom of a larger problem
3835660	3837040	that is ignored because the video games
3837040	3839680	are a scapegoat that's a very good word
3839680	3843360	for what's going on there scapegoat gold
3843360	3845380	banjo says I have so much video game
3845380	3847000	systems and stuff that I always have
3847000	3848480	stuff to do when my parents take away
3848480	3851440	something well maybe they need to lock
3851440	3853360	you in a room with with fluffy walls and
3853360	3855360	I don't know blaze says I don't buy this
3855360	3857160	addiction thing those types of doctors
3857160	3858680	are the same to buy into the whole truth
3858680	3862040	serum thing yikes all right anyway
3862040	3864880	someone is now you can do your story so
3864880	3867720	apparently there is this is coming from a
3867720	3869560	game spot forum poster said they were
3869560	3871800	took part in a recent survey about a
3871800	3874440	unannounced PlayStation Network episodic
3874440	3877640	game called nine-to-five apparently the
3877640	3880160	game is supposed to be kind of like an
3880160	3883240	interactive sitcom where you're
3883240	3885440	basically kissing the boss's butt to
3885440	3888880	avoid being fired you know all sorts of
3888880	3890720	weird stuff like that kind of like the
3890720	3892520	office or something anyways they're
3892520	3894560	saying that it's supposed to have four
3894560	3898360	episodes which introduce you to mega
3898360	3902480	Corp I guess a multinational corporation
3902480	3905120	obviously fake each episode supposed to
3905120	3907560	be about three hours long with sitcom
3907560	3910760	storylines and cliffhangers about 25
3910760	3912640	characters they're going to be in the
3912640	3915680	actual thing and you can interact with
3915680	3917560	each one of them including like flirting
3917560	3919520	and whatnot apparently it's going to be
3919520	3923200	written by written and I guess voice
3923200	3925720	acted by people that have been on comedy
3925720	3928560	Central's Saturday Night Live Daily Show
3928560	3933240	spell show Conan Bryan etc interesting
3933240	3935880	and the game supposed to run about five
3935880	3937640	dollars for an episode or fourteen
3937640	3940280	dollars for all four Wonder Dog Herald
3940280	3942360	says nine-to-five should be based on the
3942360	3947600	movie fuck yes but Dolly Parton hell

4013600	4016360	is that really a surprise to anybody no
4016360	4019120	chirp chirp chirp speaking of which was
4019120	4021680	that there's like two more Harvest Moon
4021680	4025800	games coming out this summer on the PSP
4025800	4029480	and DS shock and I'm so say guess what
4029480	4031400	they're all the same and they're still
4031400	4035440	not as good as Animal Crossing fucking
4035440	4038240	same and you people still buy him we're
4038240	4039840	starting to wrap up this segment here
4039840	4041640	but not out before a couple more stories
4041640	4043640	here we want to show Sony a little love
4043640	4044720	we haven't really talked a whole lot
4044720	4046320	about them tonight we got to say this
4046320	4048240	Sony and I don't know if you would
4048240	4049600	consider this love though because this
4049600	4051320	may be an anti Sony statement I don't
4051320	4054240	know here but what's going on here is
4054240	4057800	that Sony who is the direct the director
4057800	4060120	of PlayStation Network operations Eric
4060120	4063600	Lempel said that the PlayStation Network
4063600	4067360	may not always be free he said basically
4067360	4069160	that the PlayStation Network's only real
4069160	4070880	difference over Xbox Live is the price
4070880	4074840	which you know mmm interesting but then
4074840	4076800	of course then this other exec kind of
4076800	4078120	stepped in and then said well it may not
4078120	4080240	always be free so kind of interesting
4080240	4082160	and I wouldn't say that's the only
4082160	4083920	difference between the two well yeah
4083920	4085400	that in the Xbox Live Marketplace has a
4085400	4087280	lot of content or as the PlayStation
4087280	4088480	Network as I understand it has very
4088480	4090480	little content now granted PlayStation
4090480	4092280	it has some very good content like that
4092280	4095040	Tekken game good start and you know
4095040	4096560	there's a lot of promising things about
4096560	4097720	some of these originals they're making
4097720	4099560	on PlayStation Network they look a heck
4099560	4101040	of a lot more promising than some of the
4101040	4104280	rehash stuff we get on Xbox Live but you
4104280	4106560	know is it gonna be too little too late
4106560	4109840	that's you know all I worry about so
4109840	4112880	that's nice speaking of something a
4112880	4115600	little too little too late Dead or Alive
4115600	4118400	the movie is delayed forever and it
4118400	4121680	finally came out and how did it do well
4121680	4126360	it sucked it stinks as Jay would say
4126360	4130320	from the critic apparently opened on
4130320	4133200	505 screens across the country and
4133200	4135640	pulled in a whopping two hundred and
4135640	4138280	thirty two thousand dollars which is
4138280	4140240	crappy that's about four hundred and
4140240	4142120	sixty dollars per screen oh my god
4142120	4144640	that's atrocious that's like what movies
4144640	4146800	at discount theaters make like that's
4146800	4148600	what a movie is like almost on video
4148600	4150680	what it's supposed to make that's really
4150680	4152760	bad is that because of is that because
4152760	4155800	piracy ruined it is that because I never
4155800	4158040	saw a single ad for this game outside of
4158040	4159720	the internet anywhere I don't think the
4159720	4161840	advertising motion lack of emotion but
4161840	4165080	it also opened up against what the hell
4165080	4167080	did open up against something that was a
4167080	4170400	lot better than it was well to any other
4170400	4173840	movie I think it opened up against not
4173840	4176520	pirates but I mean pirates came out
4176520	4178760	shortly before it but just any other
4178760	4180520	movie but Fantastic Four I think came
4180520	4182240	out the same week Silver Surfer that's
4182240	4183920	right which I don't know I'm hearing
4183920	4185720	that movie ain't all that either but I
4185720	4188200	don't I don't I still want to see it it
4188200	4189640	depends on who you ask I don't I don't
4189640	4191440	get excited about summer movies anymore
4191440	4193240	except for Transformers I really do want
4193240	4194720	to see Transformers I didn't want to see
4194720	4198040	until I saw those last few trailers let's
4198040	4200920	see Ross steel UT says sky it's because
4200920	4203040	it sucked and that's what Cy Coon says
4203040	4206560	to us because it fucking sucked the afro
4206560	4208080	guy said why isn't the dead or alive
4208080	4210600	movie on DVD I mean why didn't it go
4210600	4212840	straight to DVD that's a good question
4212840	4215000	Loki I don't know you used to do before
4215000	4216920	you were doing games distribution you
4216920	4219040	did movie distribution so any insight on
4219040	4220400	that what kind of movies tend to go
4220400	4226200	directly to DVD well besides the Disney
4226200	4228880	sequels like Cinderella three there are
4228880	4230400	a lot of Disney sequels they go straight
4230400	4232560	to DVD usually movies that they don't
4232560	4235120	want to spend money on advertising
4235120	4236440	because it costs a lot of money to
4236440	4238560	advertise a movie and if they feel it's
4238560	4240440	not going to do that well in theaters
4240440	4243080	they'll release it straight to DVD you
4243080	4244800	get actually there are there's a whole
4244800	4249240	you know set of was it a movie companies
4249240	4252400	that do knockoff movies in fact their
4252400	4255920	latest one happens to be spoofing I'll
4255920	4259160	really call it spoofing but having the
4259160	4263120	exact same plot line and stuff as
4263120	4267680	transformers is called transmorphers you
4267680	4271520	know go bot and also they have was it
4271520	4274200	snakes on a train stuff like that so a
4274200	4275880	lot of that goes I like cheese just said
4275880	4278600	that snakes on the train yeah but um I
4278600	4280400	don't know also what was that movie we
4280400	4281960	all watched cheerleading ninjas or
4281960	4283240	whatever that was cheerleader ninjas
4283240	4287080	then it was incredible that was not I've
4287080	4288800	got some good ones though I've got some
4288800	4291240	good ones that are coming out was it
4291240	4293880	dead clowns about zombie clowns that's
4293880	4295560	going to be cool oh god it's a clowns
4295560	4298000	what's your house from outer space killer
4298000	4299320	clowns from outer space that's gonna be
4299320	4301400	awesome no that already came out I know
4301400	4303840	years ago I know and it was awesome when
4303840	4307760	I have a whole clown horror night people
4307760	4311040	are raving about the DVD sequels in chat
4311040	4312840	even though this isn't game related I
4312840	4315200	guess it is a little bit dark Tetsuya
4315200	4318680	says I mean really Bambi to WTF I know
4318680	4321240	what the hell Bambi to Bambi to my mom
4321240	4323320	is still dead no Bambi to Bambi was
4323320	4325560	grown up and it's his kids now so oh
4325560	4327660	well that makes it okay that's a big
4327660	4329720	Disney cop-out I'm sorry the only Bambi
4329720	4331560	to I was ever interested in was there
4331560	4333640	was Godzilla vs. Bambi and then Godzilla
4333640	4338600	vs. Bambi to Bambi's revenge Godzilla
4338600	4341080	vs. Bambi was alone in the dark to the
4341080	4343600	afro guy says isn't there a Lion King 4
4343600	4345120	I don't think I don't know if there's a
4345120	4346680	Lion King for but if I remember right
4346680	4348840	there was a Lion King like two and a
4348840	4351200	half one in a one and a half but one of
4351200	4352280	these movies I don't know if it was one
4352280	4353920	and a half or Lion King three one of
4353920	4357640	these movies was where the Lion King's
4357640	4359840	forever Simba's friends what were his
4359840	4362240	friends name that's right too many
4362240	4365200	people like the side story about where
4365200	4367840	the friends are right now yeah was what
4367840	4370000	wall they what the hell was that no it
4370000	4371000	It was funny.
4371000	4372000	It was pretty funny.
4372000	4373000	They actually did...
4373000	4377880	It was Lion King One and a Half and it was about what was going on from their perspective
4377880	4378880	and stuff.
4378880	4379880	And I don't know.
4379880	4380880	It was kind of neat.
4380880	4381880	It was funny.
4381880	4382880	But yeah.
4382880	4383880	There's a lot to go straight to DVD.
4383880	4385280	I mean, just look at your video store.
4385280	4386280	I mean, your local video store.
4386280	4387280	So why not Dead or Alive?
4387280	4388720	This was a prime candidate to go straight to DVD.
4388720	4393000	It was supposed to go straight to DVD at one time, but they decided, hey, we're going to
4393000	4395280	release it to the theaters because people are going to go see it.
4395280	4396940	Boy, were they wrong.
4396940	4399760	But how much money does it cost to put a movie in theaters?
4399760	4403480	I mean, if they didn't spend any money on promotion, did they really lose anything?
4403480	4404480	Not a whole lot.
4404480	4405480	They probably wouldn't lose anything.
4405480	4408360	And it actually probably would help the film a little bit, especially if they leave it
4408360	4410320	in there long enough to do a few million dollars.
4410320	4412360	Because they'll be able to get that one critic.
4412360	4416480	Because the thing about putting your movie in theaters is that the critics will review
4416480	4417480	it.
4417480	4423560	So you'll get that one critic who will give the movie an amazing review just because he
4423560	4426960	wants to have his name in all the papers in the advertisement.
4426960	4438760	Dead or Alive is a very tantalizing action movie.
4438760	4439760	And it sucks.
4439760	4440760	But they wouldn't say that.
4440760	4444680	They'd leave that part out.
4444680	4445680	Sexy action.
4445680	4449960	If you were to call this movie great and awesome, you would be horribly wrong.
4449960	4453080	It's great and awesome.
4453080	4456000	DJ Morpheus in Chat Room makes a local joke.
4456000	4458420	Those of you folks from Sacramento will love this joke.
4458420	4464000	And it's always Mark S. Allen.
4464000	4468100	Tiger Claw says there's a Starship Troopers 3 in the works that's going straight to video.
4468100	4471120	And Casper Van Dien is reprising the role he did in the first movie.
4471120	4473720	That's because Casper Van Dien hasn't really done anything in the series.
4473720	4475080	He has done a lot of things.
4475080	4476080	Has he?
4476080	4477080	It's all straight to DVD.
4477080	4479920	Well, that's a heck of a career.
4479920	4484880	There's a lot of people that, that's how you know they've kind of lost it.
4484880	4489160	There's a Jean-Claude Van Damme and fucking Steven Seagal, man.
4489160	4490980	They're still making stuff.
4490980	4491980	A lot of things.
4491980	4493920	Because people actually buy that shit up.
4493920	4496800	Same thing with Chuck Norris, dude.
4496800	4498160	Chuck Norris hasn't made too much.
4498160	4502080	I still say they need to do Chuck Norris vs. The World, you know, because I would say that
4502080	4503080	would totally fit.
4503080	4505540	I say Freddy vs. Jason vs. Walker Texas Ranger.
4505540	4507860	How about that?
4507860	4510920	Chuck Norris vs. Michael Myers.
4510920	4512760	Okay, now we're crazy.
4512760	4519680	Alright, anyway, somebody also made a point much earlier, and I apologize because your
4519680	4523680	comments rolled way off the screen, but somebody said porn goes direct to DVD.
4523680	4524680	All of it.
4524680	4525680	Yeah.
4525680	4526680	Well, I don't know.
4526680	4529120	We don't really keep tabs of the porno theaters around here.
4529120	4534120	Theaters weren't really what they used to be for porn, if you know what I mean.
4534120	4538260	Jiranami would like to point out that Orange Lounge is not Baron's Chat.
4538260	4539680	That's a World of Warcraft joke.
4539680	4543680	Anyhow, alright, I guess we're going to bring this segment to a close here.
4543680	4545800	We're going to finish off part A here.
4545800	4550600	However, part B is coming up, and we're actually going to put the news away tonight for part
4550600	4554400	B. We're all done with the news, and actually, I should ask real quick, Logie, do you have
4554400	4557400	any last minute things you want to add, because I know you had a few stories.
4557400	4558400	Maybe.
4558400	4559400	Alright, go ahead.
4559400	4560400	Go ahead.
4560400	4561400	Well, we'll do it later.
4561400	4562400	You want to do it later?
4562400	4563400	Yeah, we'll do it later.
4563400	4564400	Alright, we'll do it later.
4564400	4565400	Fine.
4565400	4566400	We'll put it in part B. In an opportune time.
4566400	4567400	Alright, then perhaps we're not recording.
4567400	4579760	The majority of part B will be your calls, and we're dedicating it to you guys, the fans,
4579760	4583160	the people that have listened every week, that have stuck with Orange Lounge Radio for
4583160	4588520	the past five years, and really helped made this show what it is, and quite honestly,
4588520	4592000	given us the motivation to continue to do this show.
4592000	4595000	It's never really been about the number of people that are listening, because to put
4595000	4598120	it in perspective, we don't talk about the number of people we have listen to our show
4598120	4600840	very often, because to me, that's private information.
4600840	4604600	That's not really, you know, that's our business, and we don't really need to brag.
4604600	4610160	But for real, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio had 15 listeners.
4610160	4615320	We had 15 listeners for episode one of Orange Lounge Radio, and that was after lots of hype,
4615320	4619120	lots of, you know, posting on DDR Freak, because we were a Bamani music-related show at the
4619120	4620120	time.
4620120	4621120	And I couldn't.
4621120	4622120	Huh?
4622120	4623120	And I couldn't.
4623120	4624120	That's right, because you were in a weird place.
4624120	4625680	You were in a weird position at the time of DDR Freak Radio.
4625680	4629240	And we can admit now, five years later, that a whole lot of this, this is the weirdest
4629240	4635000	thing happened here, is that Iguana Girl and I used to be BFF, but then we had like a major
4635000	4636000	falling out.
4636000	4639240	And Iguana Girl and I didn't speak for like three years, seriously.
4639240	4640480	It was pretty dirty.
4640480	4643880	But the weirdest thing, and the reason why I can say that now is because we're cool now.
4643880	4649240	You know, we don't hang out every day, but, you know, she's got her life, I've got mine.
4649240	4653680	We used to understand, we had a treaty.
4653680	4655000	We had a peace treaty signature.
4655000	4656000	Anyway.
4656000	4660120	But the weirdest thing happened is that DDR Freak Radio started, like, and Orange Launch
4660120	4662960	Radio, like both of us had the plans to do an online radio station.
4662960	4663960	I didn't say anything.
4663960	4664960	Yeah.
4664960	4665960	And nobody, neither one of us kind of knew.
4665960	4667840	And I knew both ends.
4667840	4669600	So it was just kind of weird the way that happened.
4669600	4671200	But regardless, why did we bring that up?
4671200	4675480	Oh yeah, because we, I tried to promote a lot on DDR Freak, and some of the other Bamani,
4675480	4678480	I can't remember if Bamani style even existed at the time, but some of the other DDR sites.
4678480	4679480	Bamani style was around.
4679480	4680480	Were they?
4680480	4682640	Some of the other sites that were around at that time, we tried to promote the show.
4682640	4685680	We had a whopping 15 listeners for the first episode.
4685680	4690780	And pretty much, honestly, guys, for about the first three years of Orange Launch Radio,
4690780	4693440	for about the first three years of Orange Launch Radio, I would say we were lucky if
4693440	4696960	we pulled 40 listeners in the third year.
4696960	4699160	And that's just the way live radio is, boys and girls, you know.
4699160	4703320	A lot of folks don't, you know, live 365 kind of limits us a little bit.
4703320	4707680	And the fact that it's, you know, live show, you know, some other people have better things
4707680	4709560	to do Sunday night, which is understandable.
4709560	4713420	But really, podcasting, audio blogging, whatever you want to call it, it really opened doors
4713420	4718960	for us, because we were really fortunate to jump on that train before it really took off
4718960	4722400	when iTunes incorporated podcasting in June of 05.
4722400	4724280	And that was just really awesome for us.
4724280	4728400	And now our listenership is, you know, I can say it's in the thousands.
4728400	4732720	It's not like, we're not talking like 9,000, more like two or three thousand people that
4732720	4733720	we have.
4733720	4734720	We had the 4,000 week.
4734720	4738520	Yeah, I mean, but you know, it doesn't, you know, whatever, it's just interesting that
4738520	4741640	it's blown up so much, thanks to this podcasting thing.
4741640	4743800	But for me, really not a lot has changed.
4743800	4748040	The motivation continues to be, because we don't hear from all 4,000 of you.
4748040	4750720	We appreciate the fact that you guys are listening to the show.
4750720	4753640	Dear God, not all 4,000 people email me.
4753640	4754640	We appreciate you guys listening.
4754640	4755640	I think they should.
4755640	4756640	And you know, we don't...
4756640	4757640	We can check the email, how's that?
4757640	4758640	Let me say this too.
4758640	4760440	I got to try to wrap this up, because I don't want to.
4760440	4763280	But we don't know if all 4,000 people are actually listening.
4763280	4766900	There might be people that click on the file, but don't actually download it, you know.
4766900	4770280	So we don't actually know exactly how many of those are actual, real listeners.
4770280	4774460	We speculate we have about 1,800 real, actual people subscribing to the show.
4774460	4776760	But anyway, that's regardless.
4776760	4779560	You know, we don't hear from all those people on a real, regular basis.
4779560	4784240	It's the chatters, it's the callers, it's the folks that send us emails, it's the people
4784240	4787480	that reach out that really have kind of given us that motivation to keep going for the past
4787480	4788480	five years.
4788480	4789480	At least that's how I feel.
4789480	4792280	I don't know about you guys, but that's really been what it is.
4792280	4800400	Well, I personally want to dedicate our success to the powers of the underworld.
4800400	4802720	And that demonic pact you signed one day?
4802720	4806520	Yeah, but I got my, they refunded me my soul.
4806520	4808520	Loki, anything you want to add?
4808520	4809520	I don't know.
4809520	4812320	What keeps you motivated week after week to do this program?
4812320	4814320	I'm motivated?
4814320	4815320	You're an asshole.
4815320	4816320	I'm motivated.
4816320	4819520	Like on my live journalism, I'm motivated by spite and porn.
4819520	4820520	Alright.
4820520	4823680	I'm motivated by my non-video game addiction.
4823680	4824680	Alright.
4824680	4828240	Well, anyhow, so we're dedicating part B to you guys, the listeners, tonight.
4828240	4831640	We're going to open up the Skype lines all night long and just kind of BS with you guys
4831640	4835240	and just kind of talk about, you know, what you've been up to in gaming for the past five
4835240	4836240	years.
4836240	4838440	We're going to talk about, you know, your favorite gaming memories and just whatever
4838440	4839880	question we feel like asking.
4839880	4843520	Because also tonight, Dark Soccer and Loki don't know this, but usually I control the
4843520	4844520	Skype phone calls.
4844520	4845520	Oh no, not tonight.
4845520	4848000	We're going to take turns answering the phone tonight, so Loki you actually have to pay
4848000	4851040	attention tonight because we're all going to take turns answering the phone tonight.
4851040	4852200	I don't like turns!
4852200	4853200	Too bad.
4853200	4855520	So we'll be back and who knows what could happen.
4855520	4858040	It's going to be a very interesting part B on this, our five-year anniversary.
