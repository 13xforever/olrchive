14005	24809	Tonight, June 3rd, 2007, rumors surface about Mario Kart Wii, Blizzard strikes against Gold Farmer's WoW, and a famous 80's movie is about to be made into a PC game.
31778	36624	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37004	43792	You should know by now that we're that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44293	49999	We'll be here with you for the next few hours in two parts of a show to talk about the latest and what's going on in the gaming world.
50360	51281	My name is Rob Roberts.
51792	55173	Say hello also to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55353	55734	Beer!
56714	57134	Beer!
57814	58735	It's what's tasty.
58815	60175	That was my weekend was beer.
60476	64277	Actually, I don't really care for much beer except for Guinness, which isn't a beer, it's a stout.
64417	66258	No, no, you need to have Newcastle.
66918	67659	I've had Newcastle.
67679	68099	I like Newcastle.
68139	69139	Newcastle is permissible.
69299	71620	I actually got my husband to like a beer.
72220	72541	What's that?
73021	74021	He likes Killian's Red.
74281	78223	See, if I'm going to drink, I'm going to drink something that's actually going to get me drunk.
78283	79603	Therefore, beer doesn't work.
79984	80844	Depends on what you drink.
81229	83270	Shimei Shimei Shimei Shimei
110512	111112	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
140339	140619	DarkSakura.com
170629	170949	Boobies!
172150	172330	Boobies!
195970	197750	Video games are really expensive.
197770	198250	I know.
198450	201611	We don't talk about that enough on this show, but they are freaking expensive.
201651	203491	But I have my Pokemans.
204872	205772	I've been going to the gym.
206132	208772	I'm back to going to the gym now that my doctor's giving me the okay.
209312	211493	So I get on the recumbent bike and play with my Pokemans.
211713	212713	What's a recumbent bike?
213133	215213	The recumbent bike is where you sit down like you're in a chair.
216694	217314	Sounds dirty.
217914	220574	Well, you know a standard stationary bike has you upright.
220975	222675	Recumbent means leaning back.
222955	223395	Oh, okay.
224073	225774	So I go on the recumbent bike.
225794	228616	So it's like one of those boats that you pedal by.
228797	229077	Yeah.
229117	231739	Or those lame-ass bikes that you see people pedaling.
231779	234281	They're sitting back, and it looks stupid.
235081	236242	Oh, on the streets and stuff.
236262	237883	It actually works out your legs, though, a different way.
238003	238704	It's not always much.
239204	244628	Because I have to work back into my whole routine, I'm doing the recumbent bike so I can sit down and play with my Pokemans.
244648	246510	Because you cannot play Pokemans on the elliptical.
247310	248671	Yeah, that would be kind of tough.
248892	250933	You can't even freaking read on the elliptical.
251273	252894	It's like, I've got to move my arms, too.
253075	253415	Shit.
254542	254942	DarkSakura.com
283995	284495	Hey!
286095	287196	Alright, anyhow.
287936	288976	Have I pinged out of chat?
289016	290936	Chat room hasn't moved for me in a few minutes.
290956	291577	That's concerning.
292017	294657	I'll check on that while Loki talks about his gaming week.
295337	296778	Which, did it involve going to the gym?
299818	302039	I don't remember if I did go to the gym this week or not.
302359	303339	I think I did one day.
303739	304059	Oh, okay.
304659	304899	One day.
305919	307720	I don't like to, so I don't do it.
308880	309140	Anyways.
310451	314454	So, this week I played a lot of weird stuff, other than the usual stuff.
314995	320880	I played more Super Paper Mario, and to be honest, it's getting very repetitive towards the end of the game.
321500	323802	Almost like they've ran out of ideas what to do.
323822	330888	It's like, well, let's just throw a hundred of these towards you, and how about let's make you replay levels again, and oh, that's fun.
331989	338794	So, I'll be very glad to see this game over, and I'll be very glad to return it for some store credit.
339264	341185	because it's not worth playing again.
341826	343467	Even with all the side crap, not worth it.
345929	346569	Let's see.
347049	349571	Then I played my PlayStation 3.
350132	358618	Yes, dusted that thing off, and then did a nice old firmware update, and then created myself a Japanese account to download Folklore.
359338	361139	And I played it, and it's pretty fun.
362880	365682	Although, since it's in Japanese, I have no idea what the storyline is.
365903	366863	What is this game all about?
366903	367904	Because I know nothing about it.
368982	375003	Well, um, I'm not really sure, like I said, because it's all in Japanese, but, um, there's two different characters you get to play as.
375503	391026	I played through as the guy in the game, and you actually, what you're doing is kind of stealing the souls of these, like, critters that you kill, like, different, uh, enemies, almost like in Final Fantasy, and you gain abilities that they have, and you use those as your attacks throughout the game.
391146	395227	So, once you've gotten some abilities and stuff, um,
395745	396626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
419252	422514	I'm sure there's something that I'm just not getting in the translation of the game.
422975	428479	Speaking of all this shaking and body parts and stuff, what do you know about the Mortal Kombat Armageddon on the Wii?
428499	429720	Because I'm really tempted to get it.
429780	433102	It looks awesome, and apparently it's pretty easy to play because of the controls.
433282	433523	Really?
433783	434023	Yeah.
434223	434463	Hmm.
435384	436305	I'm tempted to play.
436505	440108	Plus it has motor combat, and you can use, you know, your... That's true.
440428	448534	Your... I guess it's supposed to be sort of controlled almost like... Not necessarily... I guess like Excite Trek a little bit.
448614	448774	Hmm.
449110	451392	I played the one on PlayStation 2, and it was decent.
451432	457418	I mean, there was a lot of stuff they crammed into one, you know, considering it was on the, I guess you should say, current-gen consoles or whatever.
458099	459360	They really crammed a lot into it.
459721	463164	So, you know, I'm interested in checking out the one on the Wii.
463184	463905	I hear it's pretty cool, though.
463945	467789	Like, just from some of the descriptions, and they had, like, a little gameplay video there, too.
468928	470629	Showing, you know, how you would play the game and stuff.
470669	471569	It looked very simple.
471729	473429	Like, even I would be able to pick it up.
473469	476310	Well, I was looking at that list of fatalities that went out to the internet this week.
476370	479932	And for some reason, we get Midway press releases all the time.
479972	481572	Which is pretty much the same things you end up seeing.
481592	484653	Because game blogs just copy-paste what they're sending out in the press release, right?
485333	488014	So we get those same things, but we never get free games for Midway.
488174	488354	Ever.
489355	489755	Cry.
489935	490835	I do.
491035	491855	Oh, well, lucky you.
492155	492716	I mean, yeah.
494224	494744	Woo!
495184	497525	I got, let's see what, Spy Hunter?
497665	498425	Woo!
498845	499505	Rampage?
499585	500106	Woo!
500346	501126	Actually, I take that back.
501206	509788	I did get free games from Midway once, because there was this very sweet gal that worked there that I met at some trade show, and she hooked me up with the Classic Game Archives, which I really like.
510048	521291	Midway put out some of my favorite stuff in the 80s, so the only thing that I complain about, about those Classic compilations, is that I have yet to see Journey the Arcade Game show up in one of them.
522170	525092	Even though it ran on the same hardware as Timber and all that other stuff, okay?
525532	527993	Well, you've got the licensing rights and stuff.
528013	528754	Who cares?
529154	529414	Anyways.
529554	532716	If they can get Tron on Xbox Live, I can get Journey on Xbox Live.
533477	534417	Don't stop believing.
535158	536458	I will hold on to that feeling.
537059	537859	You do that, sir.
538880	542542	So then I also played, well, I've downloaded a bunch of Japanese demos.
542862	548765	I've downloaded the Hot Shots Golf 5 demo, so I haven't played that, or I guess Mineno Golf 5.
550250	560856	And then I also downloaded some weird, I don't even know what the fuck it is, it's like their mascot in Japan, like some cat thing that you have, you basically raise it and it reads you Japanese news or something.
561336	564157	Is that the cat, the white cat with the big face?
564598	565058	Yeah.
565078	566179	I know what you're talking about, yeah.
566319	574663	The only problem is, in order to play that game, I had to download some update or something, and it took like an hour to download, so I got very bored with that real quick.
574683	577385	That cat was actually based off of old text emoticons.
577405	577985	Yeah.
578005	578245	Yeah.
578643	579224	B-Boy Breakdancing
598115	601559	Not exactly like Bust a Move or anything like that, but it's pretty cool.
601999	606423	It takes a lot to get used to the game, though, because there's a lot of transitioning and stuff.
606684	608686	A lot of rhythm stuff in there as well.
609006	609827	But it's pretty fun.
610848	611749	So I've got that.
612029	614652	And then what else have I been trying to play?
615533	617274	I have the full version of LocoRoco.
617294	618455	I haven't touched that yet.
618576	620898	And then also Puzzle Quest.
620938	621599	I've got that on...
622281	626525	The PSP, and then I got Nelly, the DS one, so she's been playing that a little bit.
626545	628387	But she doesn't really get the game, but she's been playing it.
629347	631709	And then, of course, Earth Defense Force 2017.
631770	634472	I've been trying to finish that game up.
635173	635733	We're almost done.
635753	637074	We almost got all the weapons on it.
637995	639977	Just trying to finish some of these harder levels.
641698	643460	And, let's see.
645242	648424	Other than that, I think I haven't really been playing too much else on...
650450	651510	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
680089	681130	or videos, I believe.
681490	684751	And you have to put the file in there.
685151	691654	So I didn't know that, and so I've been kind of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to get this thing to work, because I'm like, well, I converted it, right?
691674	692715	Why is it not fucking seeing it?
693275	695536	So finally, I figured out that's what I need to do.
695876	697017	Works like a charm now.
698097	699278	But it's pretty awesome.
700518	700818	Awesome.
700838	702999	So lots of hacking and stuff in your wake, it sounds like.
703520	704160	Lots, yes.
704700	708782	And this is only going to be a gateway to putting porn on the PS3 now, so...
709751	711953	All right, I'm glad you... At least you have a goal in mind.
711973	712854	That's good to have goals.
713695	714335	Gotta have goals.
714616	719360	Looking at the chat room for some feedback here, SSJ100Matt says, That's not a surprise, Loki.
719400	720601	It's the same with the PSP.
720721	728868	But see, that's the thing with the PSP is I put it in the video folder for the PSP because the PSP is even worse than the PS3 as far as how strict, you know, the...
729554	731535	What folders and the file names and stuff like that.
731615	734437	So I thought, okay, well I'll just throw it in there and see if that works.
734978	736319	Nope, that didn't work either.
736459	742843	So I actually had to use, it was funny, my camcorder that I have because the batteries don't work in it anymore.
743223	745745	So I just plugged that in and now it's a 20 gig jump drive.
747129	750813	The Rob D in chat says the PS3 is a gateway for porn.
751233	755336	And by the way, the PS3 is fucking easy to download demos to the Japanese accounts.
755397	756738	It's so easy to create one.
756998	758619	There's no restrictions whatsoever.
758960	762523	And you can download all your games just like the Xbox 360.
762963	765946	Anything you download on Japanese accounts is playable on all accounts.
766046	766306	Nice.
766746	767107	It's easy.
767727	768528	Alright, good tip.
769229	770650	My gaming week was pretty short.
770750	771771	There wasn't a lot to it.
772336	800805	I've been playing a lot more World of Warcraft I hit level 55 I've been grinding a lot this week trying to get to Outlands I want to get to 58 very bad because a lot of the guild which by the way our guild like blew up in the past couple weeks we have tons more people on the guild now I played I know I saw you on the other night yeah I forgot to say that I played yeah for like half a second though because then Shane kicked me off my computer because he wanted to get on and kick people out of the guild or whatever his because Shane is actually the guild leader so he I didn't get kicked tyrant and he booted like three people one night but as a joke I mean it was it was funny yeah
801283	809589	So I've been working on that because a lot of the guild is in Shane and some of them are in Outlands now and they won't shut up about how awesome the Outlands are and how they're never going back to the old world.
809669	812131	So I'm working on it, trying to get there.
812151	813813	You went to Outworld?
815354	817215	Is that Mortal Kombat or Outlands?
817515	820358	Sorry, I got my Mortal Kombat mixed up with my... No, you said Outlands.
820478	820738	Did I?
821038	821819	I said Outworlds.
822539	824401	It wouldn't surprise me if I screwed something up.
824561	825001	I usually do.
826642	830025	But then besides World of Warcraft, I've been spending a whole lot of gaming time
830472	830772	Actraiser
858359	859860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
880796	882197	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
908523	911405	Check the forums for more details or the live journal.
912346	917449	Sorry to the live listeners because I know the live listeners kind of got screwed last week because we did our thing live at Faname.
918350	920951	Unfortunately, we won't have a show next week, but we will be back on June 17th.
922353	923354	That should be a fun show.
923674	928338	And then June 24th is the 5th anniversary show of Orange Lounge Radio, the official 5th anniversary.
928718	938527	But I should mention that the live station, which went up a little bit earlier than we actually did a live show, because remember, our station was up for a little while to promote that we were going to be doing a live show back in 2002.
938987	944612	Our live station turned 5 years old this week on May 30th, so happy birthday to the live station.
945292	947274	But we'll be officially celebrating on the 24th.
947594	947854	How?
948054	948475	I don't know.
949873	950594	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
979168	981309	and, of course, everybody in chat's kind of crying.
981629	983210	ChainsawJuggling says, boo.
984251	986892	ShadowCharlie says, since I'm traveling also, I won't have to worry about it.
987492	987912	There you go.
988593	990814	Sorry, guys, but surely you understand.
991014	992055	We need vacations, too.
993315	995316	All right, so let's get into some gaming news.
995816	997057	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
997437	1002020	Yes, and there's some interesting news, not surprising at all.
1002540	1006902	But, according to the website, JudeFrance.com,
1007671	1017258	They have run into a credible rumor, they say, that says that Nintendo is going to drop the bomb at EA, or not EA, E3, Mini E3, I guess.
1018198	1021501	That they're going to be announcing a brand new Mario Kart game for the Wii.
1021721	1025984	I mean, come on, it's only a matter of time before a Mario Kart game comes out for the Wii.
1026244	1028766	Hopefully it's not a part of the arcade game, but who knows.
1029466	1033629	The other rumor is that there's going to be some new hardware news as well.
1034164	1046106	Whether this be a revision to the current Wii hardware, something altogether new, or possibly, you know, I'm thinking maybe it's a DVD playback, something like that, but no idea.
1046926	1054188	I mean, obviously there's going to be some announcements at E3, but Mario Kart, if that happens, I'm not too surprised.
1055348	1060389	Besides, this is why I buy every damn system that Nintendo puts out for Mario Kart.
1063457	1065619	I mean, it seems like a foregone conclusion to me.
1065659	1068821	I mean, obviously this game is coming out on the Wii at some point, right?
1068962	1069162	Yeah.
1069642	1070683	It's just a matter of time.
1071143	1075247	That's like saying a Mario game is coming out on a Nintendo system.
1075687	1076828	And that'd be, uh, okay?
1077448	1077829	Yeah.
1078269	1079430	Of course there's a Mario game coming out.
1079570	1081151	Alright, you guys heard it here first.
1081492	1084974	There is a new Zelda game coming out on the Wii at some point.
1085315	1088337	We don't know much more about it, but there will be another Zelda game on the Wii.
1088537	1090319	Somebody beat us to that, I think.
1090339	1090759	Goddammit.
1091516	1093356	Alright, you heard it here first.
1093857	1097837	Final Fantasy XIV will be coming out to some console at some point.
1099578	1100818	Absolutely definitive news.
1101078	1102459	Wouldn't it be funny if that was a PC game?
1102839	1103839	Then that wouldn't be a console.
1105019	1107520	Stop trying to screw our exclusive news, you bastard.
1109040	1109300	Alright.
1111121	1117422	Speaking of the... You know what's funny about... I was trying to figure out if that was the same site that a long time ago...
1118941	1120282	It was like in 2005.
1120522	1125665	I got an email from some French website about E3.
1126006	1127667	But they actually didn't mean to send it to me.
1127707	1130609	They meant to send it to some staffer that had a very similar name to me.
1131009	1133091	Like it was a missent email to my Gmail box.
1133111	1134232	It was the weirdest thing ever.
1134512	1136773	But I ended up writing the guy back and he spoke English luckily.
1136853	1139375	And I ended up giving this site pictures from E3.
1139415	1140356	I don't know if it was the same site.
1140376	1142317	I know it was like a French Nintendo only site.
1142518	1145079	Because they only used the pictures from the Nintendo booth that I took that year.
1145820	1146721	It was so interesting.
1147101	1147321	Anyway.
1147915	1148376	DarkSakura.com
1168352	1185366	Also talking about Nintendo and Virtual Console, obviously I was very happy that ActRaiser was like the 99th Virtual Console title to be released, but that means that this Monday, the 100th Virtual Console title will be released, and they've already announced it's going to be Zelda II, The Adventure of Link.
1186087	1186827	So there you have it.
1187328	1190130	So that is coming out on, I believe, what, June 4th?
1190150	1192472	Am I one of the only people that doesn't like that game?
1193353	1193593	Yes.
1193613	1193813	Yes.
1196032	1202702	No, you're not, because I've been reading game blogs, and a lot of people have been kind of saying, like, oh, it's one of the weaker Zelda games in the franchise.
1202762	1203643	No, that was a CDI.
1204901	1205961	It was just different.
1206422	1210423	But if you think about it, weren't all the sequels on Nintendo really different?
1210723	1211564	Super Mario Bros.
1211864	1213344	2, very different from 1, yes?
1213364	1214485	Super Mario Bros.
1214505	1216305	2 was not Super Mario Bros.
1216465	1219066	Right, it was the whole... There was a Super Mario 2 in Japan.
1219086	1219967	Doki Doki Panic or whatever.
1220427	1221767	That was just like the first one.
1221867	1223788	I didn't say all that international garbage.
1223828	1225129	I said here in the U.S.
1225469	1228570	But the Zelda game was released in Japan as a Zelda sequel.
1228590	1229110	Okay, how about this?
1229290	1230050	Simon's Quest.
1230611	1232291	Completely different from the first Castlevania.
1232551	1233012	That is true.
1233212	1234092	And completely better.
1235626	1235886	True.
1236166	1237206	I have to agree with that.
1237306	1240827	It was better than the first, you know, Demon Castle Dracula.
1241547	1243088	Oh, whatever, Miss Prim and Proper.
1243228	1243708	Whatever.
1244468	1246288	Miss I-play-nothing-but-import-games-my-entire-life.
1246308	1247629	I do not play nothing but import games.
1247769	1248569	All right, so there you go.
1248609	1253130	Yeah, Rob D says, Well, excuse me, DarkSakura.
1255730	1256971	I want to make that a sound file.
1256991	1259271	I need to find that old clip from the old 80s Zelda.
1259311	1261111	Just replace Princess with DarkSakura.
1261792	1262852	Or leave it at Princess.
1262872	1263652	It would be appropriate.
1264437	1264957	That's right.
1265157	1266238	Pay me my respect.
1266338	1267579	So there you go.
1267619	1271501	Nintendo is putting out Zelda 2, The Adventure, Link, and blah, blah, blah.
1271521	1272982	They're bragging that the internet connection rate is 40%.
1273022	1275223	There's more happy, though, for our friends in the UK.
1275303	1287030	For the European Virtual Console, actually, I guess I should say Europe, but there are going to be some pretty fun stuff coming out over on the Virtual Console.
1287250	1291913	You get Streets of Rage 2, which I love the Streets of Rage games.
1292193	1292954	They're really fun.
1293359	1295940	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1321279	1329406	And then coming from the TurboGrafx-16, it looks like there's World of Sports Competition, which is, well, shit.
1330327	1332629	And that's about it.
1333649	1335391	Are you saying that just because it's a sports game?
1335411	1338033	Because there's some pretty awesome old school sports games I'm waiting for.
1338053	1339414	I did not like World of Sports Competition.
1339534	1341836	It ranked right there below Keith Courage.
1342096	1347741	However, now that I have ActRacer, you know, and now what virtual console game will I complain about?
1347761	1349402	Well, obviously there's The Guardian Legend.
1349892	1352513	Remember when Zelda 2 came out on the European Virtual Console in January?
1373652	1374713	Yeah, they got it a long time ago.
1374733	1375233	So did Japan.
1375473	1376674	We've been having to wait this whole time.
1377814	1381136	Ranma says Zelda 2 was underrated and by far was one of the better titles.
1381456	1381896	No, it wasn't.
1382616	1383137	No, it wasn't.
1383357	1383937	Yes, it was!
1384237	1385618	It was not one of the better titles.
1385698	1389440	It was okay, but it was like... I will say it was pretty good.
1389760	1392461	His sword looked like a fucking dagger throughout the whole game.
1392521	1393142	It was weird.
1393602	1393942	I don't know.
1394702	1396463	I have found some fun hacks for that game, though.
1398664	1400005	Like the penis hack.
1402199	1410062	I remember I got stuck on like the fifth part of the game where I couldn't figure out jumping down the, what was it, the chimney?
1411022	1411322	Yeah.
1411342	1415364	Where you had to climb up on top of the house, but you had to get the double jump to do it.
1416464	1417044	I think, yeah.
1417924	1418185	Yeah.
1419145	1425327	I actually ended up, I don't know how, but I skipped random levels on that.
1429749	1431009	I'll probably download it and he's
1431618	1432360	Yes, I said penis, shut up!
1443527	1445168	Preferably Super Mario RPG.
1445228	1448290	Hey, you never know if Squeenix put Actraiser on there finally.
1448410	1449831	There's always a chance.
1450071	1450731	There's a chance.
1450931	1453713	What about the regular Mario Kart, not Mario Kart 64?
1454354	1455674	That needs to come on there.
1455955	1461138	Well, if it's true there's a Mario Kart Wii in the future, I would think they would time that around the release of Mario Kart Wii, right?
1461178	1464300	Yeah, I guess I gotta wait until August too for all the Metroid games.
1464340	1468042	GS68, by the way, stop doing the freaking color over your text.
1468582	1469663	But you do make a good point.
1469723	1472586	I did have the best ending thing when you died.
1472986	1474507	Game over, return of Ganon.
1475128	1475748	That's right.
1475788	1478851	When you died, it would say, game over, return of Ganon.
1478891	1480072	He's killed everybody.
1480372	1481593	He's murdered the children.
1481633	1482674	He's raped the babies.
1483134	1484275	And it's all because of you.
1484716	1488679	And next time you do the colored text like that, I'm going to kick you.
1489949	1493071	WonderDogHerald wants to know when the heck Zombie 8 My Neighbors is coming to the virtual concert.
1493091	1495232	Oh my god, that was the best game ever.
1495272	1496913	Hostile1 wants RC Pro-Am.
1496933	1498754	That's a good choice, but that's a rare game, right?
1498794	1499875	I want Fester's Quest.
1502596	1504217	That's the most random title to me.
1504257	1504718	Hey, it was good.
1504918	1505578	Blaster Master.
1505598	1506359	No it wasn't.
1506599	1508380	We need Blaster Master.
1508600	1509981	Oh, fuck Blades of Steel.
1510021	1511321	I want Blaster Master.
1511962	1512402	Never mind.
1512642	1514083	Scratch my earlier comment.
1516044	1517245	Blades of Steel can fucking wait.
1517265	1517825	I want Blaster Master.
1517885	1519066	And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.
1519645	1522066	Blaster Master has to have the grenade trick.
1523107	1523647	Every time.
1523687	1524087	Yeah, yeah.
1524348	1528870	Yeah, the way you pause it and over and over on the big jellyfish guy and some of the other bosses.
1529811	1531171	And it explodes him faster.
1531271	1536794	Okay, here's the thing, though, is that, like, every time the virtual console comes up, we keep bitching and whining about the games we want to see.
1536914	1539496	So let's move on, shall we?
1539856	1547260	They also need to change the way I can find the games on the virtual console because this ghetto JavaScript shit is lame.
1547700	1549001	Why'd you tell Firebomba to go to hell?
1549346	1551346	I said Blade of Steel was better than Blaster Master.
1551386	1551887	Go to hell.
1552247	1553127	Yeah, go to hell.
1553627	1554727	Go to hell and burn there.
1556028	1557388	And roast some marshmallows too.
1557708	1565030	Well, ours has got to be one of the only video game podcasts out there that just totally tells their listeners to go to hell when we disagree with them.
1565910	1567450	That's because we're friends.
1568030	1568270	I know.
1569091	1570951	And everybody else is telling them to go to hell too.
1570991	1574672	Yay, mom mentality.
1576087	1579528	We also need to get Yonoid because I was like... Oh, you know what else was cool?
1579608	1580269	Uniracers!
1580489	1581149	Cool spot.
1581509	1582490	We'll just get a whole bunch.
1582510	1585030	We'll just have one week where it's all like, you know, product placement.
1585051	1587151	Can we talk about new games, please?
1587752	1591293	No, let's talk about Ubisoft because they like to port over crappy games.
1591313	1592053	Go to hell!
1593254	1598136	So Ubisoft admits that they were overporting some of their GameCube games to the Wii.
1598156	1601837	Or, you know, not necessarily GameCube games, but Xbox and you name it.
1602337	1603638	I mean, with such wonderful...
1605411	1615423	games as Far Cry Vengeance, which, two-player multiplayer deathmatch, that's uber lame, okay, uber lame.
1616404	1620549	Prince of Persia Rival Swords, which, you know, is just two thrones all over again.
1620569	1624194	I thought you were going to say Rival Schools, and I'm like, that would be great.
1625404	1634210	And then of course, they may apologize now, but Driver Parallel Lines is coming out later on in June, so they're still not done that.
1634670	1639533	And then of course there's also the Monster 4x4 World Circuit, which is a crappy Xbox game.
1639873	1645277	Then there was also that GT game, which was also a GameCube game that also sucked.
1645957	1648779	Just stop porting over crappy games, seriously.
1649059	1652141	Make some new stuff, and make it better than Red Steel.
1653174	1659196	I mean, was anyone really surprised by this news that Ubisoft kind of admitted, yeah, we just ported over some of our old shit.
1660296	1660917	We were in a hurry.
1661097	1663798	Dear Ubisoft, thank you for sucking.
1664658	1667899	I mean, these games were bad for even GameCube games.
1668179	1669940	They were crappy.
1671060	1674221	But Wii Remote Control, Wii.
1674621	1678283	I liked Far Cry, you know, on the Xbox 360.
1678963	1681644	On the Wii, it was a whole different game.
1681704	1682084	It was just
1682605	1684526	That's Gauss Panic.
1712409	1718511	No, but there's one, and then, like, it flips over to, like, the real demon face with, like, the blood pouring down his face.
1718531	1720592	He goes, everybody, move your body.
1720732	1723213	And it's, like, this really horrible techno song.
1723233	1724314	Yeah, that's the game.
1724814	1730376	That's my favorite game on that MAME emulator ever because it's so random.
1730396	1734498	You have all these pictures of boobies, MAME, M-A-M-E, whatever, right?
1734838	1736178	Well, the E stands for emulator.
1737499	1737779	Whatever.
1737799	1738679	So I'm being redundant.
1738719	1740180	It's like ordering a cheese quesadilla.
1740220	1740580	Deal with it.
1740922	1742103	Alright, right?
1743204	1746706	So anyway, but, oh, this is the best game ever.
1746746	1752451	Oh, please, if you have, ask your parents' permission, though, if you're under 18, because you do see titties in it.
1752491	1753011	Or sneak.
1755733	1756554	But I didn't say that.
1756974	1759456	Alright, yeah, the chat room's going to look for the link there, see?
1759977	1761218	DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura
1790226	1793427	How about my foot, you know, kicking you in the head?
1793587	1795248	Hopefully that gave Rob D something to work with.
1795268	1795628	There you go.
1796408	1796969	By the way.
1797289	1797469	Yes.
1798249	1798789	Shut up!
1799490	1799850	Anyway.
1800690	1801510	Can we do more stories?
1801530	1802131	Yes, we can.
1802171	1806392	We'll talk about, speaking of the Wii, because we're talking about the Wii, we'll talk about Mario Party 8.
1806752	1808153	Has anyone played Mario Party 8 yet?
1808433	1808653	No.
1808773	1809033	Nope.
1809353	1810534	I've heard mixed reviews on it.
1811454	1815656	I've heard some people say it was good, and some people, like reviewers, saying it sucked.
1815756	1817416	But the real people I talked to said it was good.
1817836	1819317	So I'm not sure what to believe.
1820058	1822159	I haven't played it yet, but there it is.
1822199	1823579	Mario Party 8 is out on the street.
1823919	1826220	But the reason why we're bringing this up, that's not newsworthy.
1826240	1827160	We've already talked about that.
1827180	1842544	What is newsworthy is that folks are trying to make backup copies, quote unquote, they're making backup copies of the game as they've made backup copies of other games, but their backup copies of Mario Party 8 aren't working.
1843604	1845244	They're not working with the modded Wii units.
1845444	1847625	So has it been possible that
1848069	1850290	Nintendo has come up with a workaround for this?
1850850	1851210	I don't know.
1851391	1854672	Or perhaps the Wii has realized that it's such a crappy game that it doesn't want to play it.
1855312	1857773	It's like, I've become smarter thanks to modding.
1858074	1860094	What is this shit that you're trying to insert into me?
1861355	1861855	Be gone!
1863556	1865537	Let's see, JVmon says, I have it, Sky.
1865597	1866137	It's fun.
1867258	1869699	Gerardimo says, but really boring to play by yourself.
1870559	1872480	Well, yeah, I mean, that's just Mario Party.
1872500	1873160	It's a party game.
1873200	1876962	It's just like, I don't know, Rayman's Raven Rabbids is kind of boring to play by yourself.
1877298	1884580	Fireboma says, because it's Mario Party, it's the same game being rehashed over three different platforms and only remotely changes when it moves to another system.
1884920	1887821	Yeah, but the Wii, Wii Bo, Wii.
1889441	1890061	I don't know, we'll see.
1891362	1894602	And BlackDevilerX asks, Sky, are you going to be Princess Peach?
1894702	1897963	Hell yeah, I always play Princess Peach in the games because Peach is the winner.
1900004	1900864	She says so herself.
1902591	1903591	Well, then it must be true.
1903951	1904792	Right, it must be true.
1905232	1909753	Let's talk about some other games that are going to be coming out soon, besides Mario Party 8, which is already out.
1910033	1911213	Let's talk about upcoming games.
1911233	1912374	We'll start over in Europe.
1913094	1914594	Your mom, the game, is coming out.
1914634	1915234	No, seriously.
1916835	1921336	Actually, Loki is coming out on PC on the 4th, which has already passed.
1921796	1922156	Sorry.
1923616	1924797	No, wait, that's tomorrow, isn't it?
1925797	1927737	Well, it's already passed by the time you guys get it.
1927798	1929638	That's also Nelly's birthday, by the way.
1930262	1932784	I know, I was going to tell her happy birthday because my live journal told me.
1934225	1946013	Also coming out though on the 8th is Brothers in Arms DS, Forza Motorsport 2, Halo 2 Vista Edition for PC, of course, because Vista, you know, gives people headaches.
1946893	1956700	Mercury Meltdown Revolution on Wii, Pac-Man Rally, Pangaea Golf with Style on Wii, Trion Cube, and Vortex Senko no Ronde.
1957827	1960389	Why is it coming out with the Japanese name in Europe?
1961070	1972500	Because that's actually, that's, no, Sega Narande was the name that it was in Japan, but they added that Wartek to the front of it because that makes people want it more because it's got the word war in it.
1973241	1974522	Like, ooh, Wartek!
1974562	1978105	Well, in that case, it must be a war game or something.
1979466	1982409	I guess, you know, maybe it's just that people like,
1983806	1984687	to have something.
1984867	1986008	Hey, it beats their last.
1986108	1989652	I forget what the name before it was because there was like Battlescape.
1990693	1995197	Cinco Norondo was at one time a name possibility for it.
1995898	1998320	How does it feel that you have a game named after you coming out?
1999401	2000663	I've seen screenshots of it.
2001063	2002424	It's just like fucking Ragnarok.
2003225	2003625	Oh, goody.
2004586	2005067	Well, it's
2007099	2011483	It's definitely not about me because you wouldn't be able to contain such awesomeness in a game like that.
2012584	2014206	I can understand MMO, but, you know.
2014586	2019951	However, SSJ100Matt says there is a code in the Loki game to unlock a Tingle costume.
2020491	2021652	So, be on the lookout.
2021692	2024295	That's reason enough to get it, I think.
2025596	2027198	One of these days, Loki, you watch.
2027218	2029019	We're going to drug you and put you in the costume.
2029039	2030921	Yeah, whatever.
2031809	2040511	Anyways, so this week we see the release in the United States for Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition on the PlayStation 2 and PC.
2041672	2047293	Also on PC and coming to the 360, Call of Juarez, which is pretty awesome.
2047914	2049294	First person shooter western game.
2050554	2052435	Hospital Tycoon for the PC.
2053395	2055336	Dragon Ball Z Haru Kanaru.
2056256	2057616	That's like a tongue twister right there.
2058036	2059777	Haru Kanaru, I guess.
2060680	2062121	and Densetsu DS.
2063121	2066603	And basically just, you know, Dragon Ball Z RPG on the DS.
2067244	2068004	Or is it a fighting game?
2068344	2068745	Can't remember.
2069285	2073107	Anyways, uh... Planet Puzzle League coming to the DS.
2074208	2077930	Yeah, another, uh... What was that one game?
2079391	2079711	Ah, whatever.
2080291	2081732	Another rip-off of another puzzle game.
2082312	2087175	Puzzlescape coming to PSP and then, of course, the Sims 2 H&M stuff.
2089758	2091239	It'd be funny if it was S&M stuff.
2091399	2092760	More Sims 2 stuff?
2093160	2093380	Yeah.
2093520	2093780	More?
2093800	2096001	What is this, their 11th expansion?
2096101	2096462	Jeez.
2097002	2097282	All right.
2099263	2101724	Yeah, the H&M fashion stuff.
2103165	2107087	All right, well, moving on to Japan and what's coming out over there.
2107627	2116072	On June 7th, Harvest Moon for the Wii comes out because, you know, you just can't have a Nintendo system without a Harvest Moon game on it, so there you go.
2116807	2122309	Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End, the Japanese version of that, coming out on June the 7th as well, also on the Wii.
2123330	2129673	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not much until the 14th, but that's when Ninja Gaiden Sigma comes out, so look for that.
2131113	2137276	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, The Magician's Academy, also Wizardry X2.
2138096	2140997	The Wonder Price, I guess, is coming out there.
2141017	2143578	Or maybe it's called Wonder Price because it's discounted.
2143918	2145139	That would make a lot more sense, wouldn't it?
2146145	2149687	Also coming out, because I first read it, I thought it said Wonder Prince, but I guess not.
2150168	2164797	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, you have Kabu Trader Shun is coming out from Capcom, Kazujin Taisen coming out from Nintendo, and also another version of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End coming out on the Nintendo DS.
2166458	2171901	Also, Yoshi's Island pouches for your DS are coming out if you like Yoshi Island.
2172401	2173082	Not a game, but...
2174989	2175449	and many more.
2195509	2196329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2220823	2225487	Take note, SNK!
2228209	2230591	Alright, so that's going to do it for release dates.
2232232	2240599	Well, there's actually some really cool news for people who are fans of Second Life, is that this upcoming
2242051	2252018	Actually, I think that it's already passed given the date of, yeah, it was on June 1st at 7pm, but BBC2 was broadcasting on Second Life.
2253819	2261725	They were doing The Money Program, which is a business show that shows how big business affects everyday life.
2263746	2270071	And apparently this looks like it might become a standard thing, I hope.
2270311	2271752	Did somebody throw cocks at them?
2273681	2280805	Well, for anyone in Second Life, the only place that you could go to watch it was the Red Run Red Cinema in Second Life.
2281686	2283207	But I think it's kind of cool.
2283247	2285108	I totally have never played Second Life.
2285148	2286289	This stuff is all foreign to me.
2286349	2289390	I tried once and thought it was crap, so I stopped playing.
2289671	2292512	All I ever can think about was Second Life with the flying penises.
2292572	2293853	I saw that one YouTube video.
2293893	2294954	I have real life.
2295774	2297195	You know, I have a first life.
2297415	2302258	It would be fun just to roam around Second Life and do stuff to annoy people.
2302748	2309951	Other than the cool thing is that someone actually built the inside of the TARDIS and built Daleks and all that.
2309971	2310732	I thought it was cool.
2310912	2311772	Nerds, all of you.
2311992	2319496	I would want to make a giant stick man that's like, you know, 500 stories tall that stomps around and smashes everything.
2319836	2321637	I know, can we have monsters in Second Life?
2321677	2322758	Like, can I make Godzilla?
2323418	2328320	Well, people made, you know, weapons of mass destruction and have blown stuff up, so... That's lovely.
2328781	2329581	So why not?
2331303	2336727	Giant Mario, have him get the star thing, turn into the pixelated Mario, Smash, Smash, Smash.
2337368	2338869	People would find humor in that, I would think.
2339149	2341651	I saw a really funny picture speaking of Mario Smash.
2342311	2350577	It was someone's signature on our forums, on the DarkSakura forums, because that's where our World of Warcraft guild has their forums headquartered.
2350597	2352579	Wellplay.DarkSakura.com There you have it.
2352759	2356922	And somebody made this little graphic or found it somewhere of, you see...
2357594	2358054	Super Mario Bros.
2358074	2358695	3 Super Mario Bros. 3
2385956	2387317	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2411570	2420597	Check out the Fury Beta sign-up page at www.unleashthefury.com and slash beta.
2420977	2421998	And you can check out that.
2422959	2423779	Looks pretty neat.
2424159	2425561	There was some other game out there.
2425781	2431265	I can't remember the name of it, but it was a Korean MMO that's kind of like, they compared it to The Matrix.
2431725	2436108	A lot of, you know, jumping on walls, or running on walls in gunfights and stuff like that.
2437049	2438130	But this looks kind of neat.
2439011	2439491	Love the title.
2443430	2444191	Oh, wait, you saw the picture?
2444211	2446172	I was just watching it because Junami linked it.
2446372	2447233	Yeah, I didn't even see it.
2447253	2448253	Junami beat me to it.
2448293	2448934	You bastard!
2449814	2450355	Good job, though.
2450835	2451215	Chat room.
2452496	2453537	Meanwhile, I'm looking it up.
2453797	2461322	But I got distracted by a post because somebody was spamming the forums again, advertising Viagra, and, you know, I was just really curious because... No, I'm kidding.
2461382	2463744	Nobody reads those posts on any forum.
2464064	2464864	I don't understand.
2466706	2468867	You're just now seeing the Loki tingle graphic?
2469788	2472309	One of our listeners did that, like, last week and put it on my All Games blog.
2472329	2473310	Anyway, sorry.
2473868	2474969	This is not good radio.
2475049	2475310	Fail.
2493471	2495012	Uh, and, uh, let's see.
2495092	2500176	The sign-up started, it looks like, on May 31st, and I don't see a closed date.
2500556	2505939	Of course, this is going to be an MMO from Perpetual Entertainment, and you get to be the son or a daughter of an Olympus god.
2507260	2516666	And then, uh, so you get to conquer enemies of Rome, you get to battle the iconic enemies such as the Cyclops, Minotaur, Hydra, so on, Medusa, etc., etc.
2517187	2518087	So, check that out.
2518187	2521369	If you're into MMOs and you like Greek mythology, it'd be a good time.
2521389	2522010	And the, the
2522628	2523128	DarkSakura.com
2555034	2564697	Today's website of the week actually is brought to me by my amazing sauce, who is wonderful and full of internet nerdness and greatness.
2565458	2574241	It's lolbots.com, and this basically takes Caturday and just macros every freaking nerdy thing ever in existence.
2574581	2578222	I'll have you know that my wife looked at this and she didn't get it.
2578722	2580623	As did I. I didn't get it.
2581523	2582864	I lol'd a couple times.
2583194	2585536	You do not have the geek vibe in you, obviously.
2585556	2585956	I do.
2586376	2588357	I understand why it's supposed to be funny.
2588818	2590239	I just don't care anymore.
2590759	2592080	It's just like, it's old.
2593041	2593581	Give it up.
2593721	2594902	Okay, yeah, we get it.
2595002	2595382	Okay.
2595662	2601286	There's been games that have been translated, literally, you know, from their Japanese stuff, and it was funny because it was English.
2601486	2602427	Ooh, funny!
2602527	2603047	Ha ha!
2603367	2604728	You know, get over it!
2604768	2605709	That was years ago!
2605829	2606429	Come on!
2607010	2610372	You know, literacy is not a jokey matter.
2614392	2616733	I don't even know where the hell we go after that.
2617913	2618554	Prozac.
2619674	2620955	You should get some.
2622855	2623696	Valium, maybe.
2624336	2627537	LOLbots.com Valium.com for Loki.
2628578	2636060	Maybe you need to be reading some of those forum posts that advertise the, you know, antidepressants from the interwebs.
2637861	2640522	Remember, if you have trouble keeping it up, read the Viagra spam.
2642003	2642303	Well...
2643124	2647385	Doing our weekly part in promoting GameTap.
2648546	2650766	Swear to God we're not on their payroll, I swear.
2651607	2652487	Yeah, we are.
2653207	2654828	We're not getting paid.
2656288	2657788	They fixed the glitch in accounting.
2658569	2659009	Anyways...
2661660	2667963	On top of their normal subscription service, they're doing a free ad-supported service that's coming out.
2667983	2671905	They're going to be rotating 30 games every so often.
2672486	2683751	Starting off, you're going to get to play for free Panzer Dragoon, Metal Slug 2, Art of Fighting, The King of Fighters 95, and the upcoming Tomb Raider Legends.
2685233	2686313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2714400	2715481	I already bought that game.
2715521	2716161	Where's my money?
2716881	2717582	Well, you know what?
2718262	2719462	All these games are old.
2721403	2723384	And a lot of people probably already have them.
2723785	2725045	And I mean, it is the internet.
2725425	2727126	There are ways to getting stuff free.
2727366	2730368	Did GameTap open that up for those folks that are playing those?
2730408	2731568	Can they still play them online?
2732289	2734210	Do they have access to the head-to-head service on there?
2736411	2736631	Yeah.
2737431	2739012	I think some of them will have online co-op.
2739692	2740333	That's kind of cool.
2740353	2740833	Metal Slug.
2741337	2744858	So maybe now I can play with some of the cheapskates and won't pay for GameTap.
2744878	2746079	I can play some games with them online.
2746259	2749480	Rob, I will pay so we can play real Metal Slug.
2750100	2752001	Or you could just come to my house.
2753281	2762624	Or you could just wait until, I don't know, Metal Slug eventually comes to Xbox Live Arcade because, you know, SNK loves re-releasing that damn game.
2763965	2766346	Raven's Dolphin confirms it does have online multiplayer.
2766826	2767186	Interesting.
2768286	2768526	Alright.
2769107	2770087	Well, there you have it.
2771559	2777544	Also, I wanted to mention briefly, I saw in some interview somewhere that GameTap is still being worked on for the Mac.
2778185	2779566	And it could be coming out very soon.
2779786	2780827	I don't know if they had a date on that.
2781188	2782449	Which makes Loki very happy.
2783150	2785171	But no, I'll make many Mac fans out there very happy.
2785211	2786072	I think that would be very cool.
2786132	2787854	I was going to say, why would it make me happy?
2787914	2788895	I don't own a Mac.
2789515	2790036	It's a joke.
2790076	2791297	That's what we call in the industry, a joke.
2791544	2792305	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2810563	2813805	The first Sega games that I played, Rob, were on the ColecoVision.
2814365	2815506	I love the ColecoVision.
2815906	2819448	I'm so sad that I sold my ColecoVision to get a Super Nintendo.
2819648	2820668	I have another one.
2820688	2822970	I had 70 games at one time.
2823030	2825531	I used to go to flea markets and buy that shit for a buck each.
2825811	2827272	If I can find my second one, would you like it?
2827672	2832615	No, because, yeah, that time is long past.
2833275	2837397	I was thinking about hooking up the Atari 5200 the other day, just for kicks.
2838573	2843715	Alright, well, just for kicks, Gold Farmers like to annoy the shit out of me in World of Warcraft.
2843735	2852057	Seriously, I know not all our listeners play World of Warcraft, but if you've been playing in the past month, huge problems with spammers on there.
2852698	2855899	Gold Farmers just going crazy in the game, sending tells.
2856219	2865662	Well, the cool thing is that with the latest patch, Blizzard really put the smack down on it, and what they did is that now you can just right-click on a name and report them for spam automatically, and
2865984	2866264	DarkSakura.com
2883652	2896556	They went a step further and said this, Blizzard has filed a federal lawsuit against the operators of Peons for Hire, which is a popular gold-selling organization, which many of you have no doubt seen advertised, because they were the ones that were really spamming in the game.
2897816	2905318	As part of the lawsuit, the operators of Peons for Hire have been asked to immediately cease all in-game spamming efforts by all entities and websites under their control.
2905418	2907739	So, Blizzard's now putting the smackdown in court.
2908379	2912880	By the way, it hasn't stopped, because now what they do, they'll send you party invites...
2913655	2915096	and then send you the spam.
2915216	2918358	So I just automatically decline party invites I'm not expecting.
2918498	2920700	Why do you think I don't party with anybody but who I know?
2921200	2921700	Well, yeah, I know.
2921720	2922181	That's what I'm saying.
2922201	2927885	But it's annoying because when you get a party invite, it goes, and the little thing pops up on the screen.
2928345	2936631	Like, the TGFRCVHJI has invited you to a party, which is just some spammer who hit their keyboard.
2937351	2940213	It's just annoying because you're trying to kill somebody and then...
2940919	2945001	Yes, and Blizzard has partnered up with Capcom to get Phoenix Wright on the case.
2945962	2946842	He'll get those spammers.
2946942	2947623	I hope so.
2948203	2948824	He'll get them.
2948864	2952285	Phoenix Wright 5 versus the gold spammers.
2953626	2953866	All right.
2953886	2954447	I can see it now.
2955287	2955627	Anyway.
2956468	2963592	Well, if anybody is interested, because, you know, Activision is just, well, we hear things now and again.
2964381	2971204	But according to their financial report, they're stating that Enemy Territory Quake Wars will be out by the end of summer.
2973385	2977927	It actually was on paper to be due during the second quarter of the fiscal 2008.
2979267	2982029	So, I don't know.
2983089	2988251	However, all they're saying is that it's still just going to be done when it's done.
2989412	2989632	Hmm.
2989972	2992013	Let me consult my magic eight ball here.
2993595	2995136	Signs point to end of August.
2996296	2997196	That's what everybody else is saying.
2998936	3000717	Oh, your magic 8-ball, huh?
3001037	3002037	Invisible 8-ball.
3002857	3004838	The 8-ball we don't speak about, ever.
3005798	3007138	Especially when Namco's in the room.
3008899	3010079	La, la, la.
3010439	3011839	It's an 8-ball, not a Katamari.
3012079	3012520	Oh, I see.
3013340	3013860	Rob.
3014140	3014400	What?
3014920	3015220	Rob.
3015440	3015680	What?
3015780	3016020	Rob.
3016300	3016541	What?
3017561	3018501	Tell us some other stuff.
3019771	3023014	Well, excuse me, DarkSakura!
3023414	3024695	Oh my god, you didn't do it right.
3025576	3027377	Okay, I don't want Rob to say anything else.
3029319	3030900	Rob's not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.
3030980	3032501	Thank you, Rob D., I heart you.
3032881	3034963	Rob is not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.
3035323	3039266	Loki, you're taking over as our mediator here.
3040827	3041508	Lord help us.
3042248	3049394	I'm going to throw something at... where's the ferret?
3050692	3051433	Is that a Kirby?
3051873	3052593	No, it's a Jigglypuff.
3052613	3053334	Let me see Jigglypuff.
3053354	3053934	I'll throw it at Rob.
3054094	3055055	I can't reach Jigglypuff.
3055075	3056976	The best part is, he sent me two.
3057776	3060978	Well, excuse me again, DarkSakura.
3067102	3068843	I hit Rob in the shoulder with a Jigglypuff.
3070124	3073126	We have the best fucking listeners of any radio program on anywhere.
3073166	3073706	No, you don't.
3073726	3074386	You suck.
3074486	3075047	Go to hell.
3076288	3076928	Anyways.
3078496	3079656	So surprise!
3080156	3086498	Final Fantasy XIII has hit its... Well, probably not the first, but one of the many delays.
3087218	3090359	This being Final Fantasy XIII Versus has been put on hold.
3091059	3102842	According to an interview with Dengeki PlayStation of Japan, Final Fantasy main man Tetsuya Nomura has revealed that he likes to only work on one project at a time.
3103522	3104503	And obviously right now...
3106147	3107428	Final Fantasy XIII Final Fantasy XIII
3127857	3131538	Release only one Final Fantasy game at a time.
3131978	3143440	Don't make 13-1, 13-2, 13-B, 13... I mean, it... You got a little happy with 7, because 7 was so popular, and it sold well, then you started doing this shit with 12.
3145641	3147221	Fucking money-hungry bitches.
3147721	3150102	Just make one game only.
3150686	3153868	And then if people like the game, they'll say, hey, I want more!
3154409	3158872	Instead of saying, hey, we have 13 games coming out for Final Fantasy XIII, collect them all.
3160534	3162295	Gotta catch them all, Final Fantasy.
3163376	3162295	13.
3164857	3165858	Fabulous, Kristen Novalis.
3168720	3169340	Kristen Novalis.
3169981	3171062	You know what that sounds like?
3171082	3173684	What was it, one of those Telemundo shows or whatever?
3175125	3175845	Kristen Novalis.
3177727	3179028	Telemundo, Telemundo.
3181462	3183342	Tonight on Sabado Gigante!
3183522	3184763	Fabulous Christian Novella!
3190424	3192604	Seems like none of this other news even matters anymore.
3193904	3205506	However, Electronic Arts out of Canada recently lifted the embargo going on for the upcoming PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 racer Need for Speed Pro Street.
3210515	3211835	Audi S4, Dodge Challenger from 71 Good times
3240081	3243042	and of course some screenshots were released as well.
3243082	3247002	Some of the new modes in the game, Tandem Drift, Drag, Grip, and Speed Challenge.
3247502	3248923	It's coming out in fall of 2007.
3249123	3253283	You can totally see in one of these screenshots here like a Drag Race kind of mode, pretty cool.
3253363	3255464	You know what I really would love the CEA to make?
3255584	3255964	What's that?
3256244	3257504	A Cannonball Run game.
3259224	3261345	They've got the graphics, they've got the engine.
3262105	3263645	Let's get Burt Reynolds on this thing.
3265426	3265966	Good times.
3267546	3267866	Yeah.
3268564	3270025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3298488	3299649	Keep it up.
3302652	3304934	This is an exciting... This makes for great radio, doesn't it?
3305474	3306975	But this is the soundtrack I have to look forward to.
3308557	3310518	Dude, this is great.
3310538	3310818	I remember.
3311039	3315582	It just looped that same thing over and over again.
3331421	3332541	Now I'm ready for the mailbag.
3335823	3337885	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3337925	3338985	DarkSakura reads them.
3339005	3339626	Here she goes.
3345970	3346470	Hey, Rob.
3347311	3347591	Yes?
3348151	3348952	Dying a plague.
3350573	3352594	Well, excuse me!
3352754	3353815	DarkSakura!
3354555	3355016	Whatever.
3356156	3356637	Um, any...
3358226	3359647	Turn off the damn music!
3359787	3360467	Oh my god.
3360487	3367012	You're trying to... You know, I was just over my PMS and you've made it worse.
3371355	3372315	I single-handedly brought it back.
3372335	3373196	Alright, read an email.
3374376	3377659	We got one from VoteForDan, I guess.
3378159	3379240	I'm not voting for him.
3379620	3380921	Oh, DrBurst, I'm sorry.
3381601	3386104	Do you think WoW will come to the Xbox 360?
3386264	3387365	Did I answer this one already?
3388581	3389682	Didn't we do that one last week?
3390103	3391764	Sorry, I already answered this last week.
3391884	3392885	Download the old podcast.
3393226	3394247	I don't think I will anyways.
3394807	3395368	Next email.
3396489	3397550	Hi everyone at OLR.
3397590	3405598	I just wanted to write a quick email to let you know that I listen to your podcasts every time a new one comes out and I have access to download it to my mp3 player.
3405658	3407961	I listen to all your podcasts multiple times while I'm working.
3408321	3410984	Each opinion from the OLR staff is extremely appreciated.
3411604	3414946	I am a member on GameTrailers.com with the username NarutoCastle.
3415486	3419368	I will be giving OLR a plug on my blog when I get a spare moment to write one on there.
3420308	3421509	We'll let you know when it's up.
3422289	3424290	I've been playing Final Fantasy 3 and enjoying it a lot.
3424410	3428612	Cannot wait for Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 5 to come out on Nintendo DS.
3429012	3430133	Well, thanks for reading my email.
3430193	3430773	Take care.
3431593	3432454	Gregory in Australia.
3434011	3438494	Thank you for the plug in your blog, because that's like word-of-mouth advertising, which is so essential for us.
3438514	3447160	Well, speaking of which, he also writes back and says, Hi guys, Greg here again, updating on my blog that lets GameTrailer members know about OLR.
3447500	3455746	Feel free to take a look at the blog, go to GameTrailers.com and search for user NarutoCastle, and you'll see blogs, and most recent should be the OLR blog.
3456246	3460929	Always doing my best to spread the word to as many people as I can, who either listen to podcasts or are into video games.
3461309	3463611	Thank you so much for a great podcast, and keep up the great work.
3464784	3466045	Aw, thank you.
3466065	3466805	Thank you.
3466825	3470507	Wait, wasn't there a question there amongst all the lovey-dovey stuff?
3470867	3471347	I don't know.
3471648	3471828	No.
3472368	3474249	Oh, I thought there was a question at the beginning of his first email.
3474269	3474689	All right, well.
3475249	3477951	Well, we have another one from Xenore, I guess how it's spelled.
3478751	3480012	X-E-N-O-O-R-E.
3481172	3482193	Hey guys, love the show.
3482333	3484334	Been listening for a few episodes here and there.
3484714	3487175	Your group dynamic always brings smiles to my cheeks.
3487771	3491533	It reminds me of my squad of geek gamers from times long past.
3491993	3492934	Keep up the awesome work.
3493114	3499097	Recently during some banter amongst the group, you commented on the combat system of Final Fantasy XII.
3499537	3501578	Your discussion intrigued me enough to give the game a shot.
3501938	3505100	Hope Squeenix sends you a big check for your promotion skills.
3505660	3507421	Best luck to you guys in the future, Zenur.
3508301	3511683	I haven't heard that expression before, bring a smile to my cheeks.
3512063	3515185	I just hope you're not talking about your ass cheeks, because that's not a compliment.
3515405	3517426	You can't smile on your ass, damn it.
3517654	3518575	What the hell is wrong with you?
3541405	3542486	Robway Gets 50 Points
3561755	3562735	for Gryffindor.
3562795	3563176	I don't know.
3565096	3567918	What can we give the listeners to do cool stuff like this?
3568018	3568358	I don't know.
3568678	3569858	Mad props, I suppose.
3569899	3571639	But that's not... I mean... A dollar.
3572280	3573940	The cars that people have been... That's right.
3574200	3575801	Rob, if you send us... Okay, here you go.
3575841	3576741	Yes, we will do that.
3577082	3581483	Rob, if you will send us your PayPal, assuming... I don't know if it's your regular email, if you have a separate email.
3581704	3586246	We will PayPal you $1 courtesy of Orange Launch Radio for your awesomeness for this car.
3586326	3587146	You should frame it, too.
3588833	3591514	Also coming from Rob's favorite person, Sakura Max.
3594255	3595255	Oh yeah, this guy.
3595275	3596115	How old is he, 11?
3596676	3596115	12.
3597056	3597816	Oh, big difference.
3598136	3602718	Quick email to say happy birthday, Jamie Rules, Loki is cool, Sky sucks.
3603678	3604878	They had lots of dots after it.
3605659	3606959	But the Bimani music is cool.
3608655	3611378	I'm so sad because some 12-year-old on the internet hates me.
3611458	3612700	Boo-hoo, what am I going to do?
3612720	3613741	I think it's kind of funny.
3614021	3616704	I asked for DarkSakuraHateMail, not SkyHateMail.
3616724	3617625	Why aren't you people listening?
3617645	3622951	Signed, SakuraMax, 12-year-old listener, one with the best email closings, wants a pet, grew, and loves Pokey.
3623373	3624373	Why do you even read his emails?
3624393	3625433	They bring nothing to the show.
3625794	3627434	They bring nothing to the show.
3627474	3628714	I just totally make an OLR car.
3628754	3632115	I'm supposed to get this game later this week, Forza 2, by the way.
3632255	3634095	I have no interest in Forza 2 whatsoever.
3634295	3635476	I don't either, but, you know.
3635496	3636056	Hey, last email.
3636276	3637696	Microsoft hooks me up sometimes.
3637976	3639837	Hey, OLR crew, it's GS68.
3639917	3644718	I enjoyed the OLR panel at Fanime, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again next year.
3644858	3645938	How is Fanime anyhow?
3646976	3647997	Any good stories to share?
3649017	3649857	That was from GS68.
3650017	3662262	Yeah, there was me deciding that my costume wasn't going to work and going in the dealer's room and dropping $120 to buy the stuff for my Iroka costume, and I ended up doing chick style.
3662682	3663422	Can I have a loan?
3663482	3663883	Shit.
3665083	3665303	No.
3666284	3668084	I got yelled at by my husband.
3668124	3668664	It was great.
3669225	3671546	Over breakfast.
3671786	3675327	I bought a bit generation game called Colorist, and I have no idea how to play it.
3676513	3678174	You got a porn star's autograph too, didn't you?
3678194	3680976	I got a porn star's autograph for my wife, and she loved that.
3681356	3683898	I also got two Harry Potter pictures for my wife.
3683958	3684938	She liked that as well.
3686059	3689601	And there's one other thing I thought I got her as well.
3690602	3691362	I can't remember.
3692243	3693123	I bought one shirt.
3693163	3695285	That's the only thing I bought at all I found in May was a shirt.
3695305	3696665	I got Dan the best thing.
3696786	3696966	What?
3697126	3698747	I got him the Goomba that makes noise.
3699147	3699827	Oh, that thing was cool.
3699847	3700488	The thing you hit and it goes...
3701712	3705714	And then you hit it one more time and it does the You're Dead music.
3706314	3709635	I went back looking for the coin box and they didn't have it.
3709835	3714057	Because you keep hitting the coin box and every tenth one it gives you a one-up.
3714657	3718639	And this isn't intended as a plug, but you can order them from WYSIWYG.
3720219	3721420	And that's where I got my Goomba from.
3721780	3723420	I also got a Totekeke.
3723540	3727382	I also got a shirt that said Grand Theft Amish, Penn State Dutch.
3727984	3730245	Yeah, from the same booth that he got that shirt, I got one.
3730926	3734027	And I actually posted a picture of the shirt in my All Games blog.
3734107	3738110	If you want to see that, it's community.allgames.com.
3738230	3739010	How the hell do you get there?
3739891	3741191	Green Sky is my username on there.
3741291	3742372	Just find me on there.
3743404	3745746	and I posted a picture of the shirt I got.
3746166	3749508	It says, This is Zelda!
3749709	3754432	And it has basically, they took a picture of the guy from 300, they took a picture of his face and put the Zelda hat on him.
3754472	3755893	It's really funny if you see it.
3755933	3756473	That's great.
3756493	3757654	I've seen that one, yeah.
3758094	3760756	I didn't even see 300 and I get the joke, so I thought it was great.
3761356	3761736	How was that?
3761937	3762597	That was the shirt I got.
3764962	3768763	Oh, I didn't mention during my gaming week, though, since he asked about how was the rest of Fonamate.
3769444	3774986	Because I got there right before our panel started, I didn't get to spend much time there, but I went to the game room afterwards.
3775206	3775926	I went the day after.
3776126	3779767	And I played some pop-up music on a Melo 2, and I got the high score on the machine.
3779867	3786389	I forgot how to get high speed, and my dumbass picked the Galaxy Express 3.9 TV theme, which is fucking slow!
3786649	3788930	I don't think you can put high speed on that one, at least I don't know how.
3789530	3790451	I couldn't figure it out either.
3790851	3791151	Because I...
3791627	3794469	I was like, dude, I can play poppin' music better than this.
3795810	3798651	I did, however, play like a crap ton of Dance Maniacs.
3799612	3801573	And we had Parapara Shadowing going on.
3802654	3803294	Oh my god, nerds.
3803314	3804154	With people who could do it.
3804214	3804655	It was good.
3804955	3805195	Wow.
3806176	3806976	Alright, so there you go.
3807376	3808977	Yeah, we'll be back if they'll have us.
3809037	3817082	And the best part was hanging out with DJ Ranma S. The best part was the mini-disc player recorded the show this time.
3817342	3817923	That's right.
3818063	3818683	Sort of.
3818743	3819824	The show didn't come out too bad.
3819944	3820204	It did.
3820885	3822325	Weird shit, and I don't know why.
3822425	3826266	Probably has something to do with the fact that the battery is slowly eating itself away.
3826986	3833368	Oh, and the other great part, we found out that Loki's Mac Heckler lives in town, so we're going to have him on a future show.
3834888	3840029	I found something cool, too, and I'm going to... Actually, next week's Side of the Week is probably going to be a plug for this guy's site.
3840829	3849271	I hung out a lot in Artist Alley, because me being an artist and having a bunch of my friends in there, I had to go and hang out with the artsy-fartsy people.
3850072	3874172	and it turned out that I got more photos taken of me wearing my Tron shirt with my Dolphy than in costume which was sort of sad but I also bought this great print of Iron Man for Sauce and this guy drew me Deadpool and he said that he'd do a full color print for me and he actually lives in the Sacramento area so I'm going to plug his site next week
3874734	3876135	I know which guy you're talking about.
3876175	3879198	The guy that does all the comic stuff and he's at like every single anime convention.
3879218	3881080	I think he's even at the Sacramento one sometime.
3881160	3889467	I think he was supposed to be here, yeah, but I'm going to give him a call about the commission for the picture because he did a really freaking good job.
3889507	3892950	There's a Sak anime convention coming up this weekend.
3893010	3894071	I can't go because I'm in New York.
3894111	3894951	Not this weekend, is it?
3895091	3896312	Yeah, I think it's coming up this next weekend.
3896333	3897694	Well, next weekend, yeah.
3897714	3899095	Well, I'll go to the mall anyways.
3900071	3901772	No, I think it's the one at the temple.
3901812	3902392	Anyway, forget it.
3903632	3904532	We'll talk about it offline.
3905293	3910114	But hey, if you run an automate convention, you want us to come do a live panel, we're open to suggestions.
3910214	3919337	Dude, sweet, to the Rob D. We're kind of broke and can't travel too much, but we're certainly open to hearing suggestions, especially anything that goes on in Northern California or Southern California.
3920044	3921744	Northern Nevada, someplace we can drive to.
3922524	3933326	No, to the Rob D, they said that they did Anime Hell at ASEN, and I didn't know, but they put the full Sega Tatsunoshiro video in that, which is like, anyone who's a Sega fan has to have seen that.
3934687	3934927	Hmm.
3935707	3939548	It's like the epitome of the Sega Saturn advertising era.
3940928	3941168	All right.
3941188	3943008	We're going to get back into some news, though.
3943308	3944328	Enough talk about conventions.
3945689	3947389	Where shall we go for another story?
3948106	3948906	Let's go to me.
3949366	3950747	Let's talk about the PSP.
3951327	3954907	Sony releases its uncrackable firmware 3.5.
3955548	3962429	It adds a bunch of new features including remote play so you have the ability to play anything that's on your PS3.
3962589	3967430	Well, movies and whatnot over the internet on your PSP.
3968690	3971011	Also, let's see here.
3971031	3976592	Yeah, also it enhances some of the RSS feeds and stuff like that.
3977863	3979685	Um, interesting.
3980406	3987652	One other feature that they forgot to mention, uh, it is actually very crackable and got cracked almost, uh, actually I think a day before it came out.
3989214	3989974	If that's possible.
3990555	4003907	But, uh, yeah, so now they're working on a new custom firmware for, uh, 3.5, and it was kind of funny because they actually used the tools from 3.3 to crack it, and apparently it wasn't that hard, so...
4005963	4009044	Was that their unhackable firmware?
4009604	4010924	Yeah, their unhackable firmware.
4012084	4013805	Each firmware is unhackable, you understand.
4014525	4014945	Of course.
4016445	4016965	Can't do it.
4017105	4017606	Just can't.
4018086	4018606	Just can't.
4018906	4019706	It's impossible.
4020986	4021326	Sad.
4021906	4025627	Oh, speaking of unhacking PSPs, it was very interesting.
4026087	4029688	I've been taking apart PSPs to fix them.
4030168	4034129	My friend's analog stick was broken and I actually took apart the entire analog stick.
4034602	4035923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4058248	4063290	This was a very interesting statement made by Activision in a conference call they had with investors this week.
4063711	4064551	This is something else.
4065191	4072855	Now, keep in mind, Activision acquired the Guitar Hero franchise when they bought out Red Octane, essentially, or their acquisition of Red Octane, whatever you want to call it.
4073795	4075236	They got the Guitar Hero franchise.
4075536	4085460	What's interesting is they have now said about Rock Band, which is coming out, it wasn't surprising that Guitar Hero has attracted imitators.
4086229	4096459	Okay, so basically you're saying Rock Band is an imitation of Guitar Hero, except you may remember Harmonix originally made Guitar Hero for Red Octane before you bought it.
4097660	4100222	So that comment made no sense at all.
4100883	4106908	And when you consider Guitar Freaks came first anyway, by Konami, you all suck.
4108390	4110952	Just make your games, make them good, and STFU?
4112438	4116522	and technically they're all rip off of Amplitude anyways, Amplitude and Frequency.
4117042	4123448	Well, the interface of Guitar Hero, that and Karaoke Revolution too a little bit.
4124509	4129273	But yeah, they really pay that guy the big bucks apparently.
4129693	4131275	He's real on top of everything.
4131855	4135418	Have you seen the gameplay footage of Guitar Hero 3 that's on the internet right now?
4135538	4138501	It looks pretty sexy, but it doesn't look that different.
4139992	4143674	I think this is the game that will finally jump the shark for everybody else.
4144594	4147675	I think the series jumped the shark already for me with this 80s edition thing.
4148015	4151036	But I think Guitar Hero 3, people are finally going to go, okay, enough.
4151936	4158719	But I think that's good that Harmonix, instead of trying to do the same thing over again, is trying to... I give them a lot of credit.
4158739	4159499	They're pretty...
4159963	4161244	Badass company in many ways.
4161504	4167467	And I think the fact that they are trying to evolve with the marketplace, with this whole rock band thing, it's a huge risk.
4167707	4169268	But then again, so is Guitar Hero.
4169568	4174351	I'm sorry, but I think Activision is going to get left behind with the Guitar Hero franchise.
4174391	4176832	It's going to be... I don't know.
4177573	4179373	It's going to be kind of like Guitar Freaks was.
4179634	4181074	I mean, look at Guitar Freaks.
4181455	4185277	How many versions of that game have come out and really they haven't innovated on each other?
4185577	4187418	Yet for some reason they're still doing well in Japan.
4187458	4188598	So that's kind of funky, but...
4189944	4191305	So you can either have one of two things.
4191385	4195128	Either it's going to still do very well, or it's just going to tank.
4196149	4203775	I think people are going to start figuring out, hey, maybe spending all this money on this guitar game each time around is not a good idea.
4203936	4210741	It's kind of like why DDR is starting to dip down a little bit in popularity, especially when it's coming out on all these new platforms.
4211081	4212803	Buy all new hardware for this shit.
4215085	4217807	Actually, we haven't heard a lot about what's going on in the DDR world in a while.
4218180	4222023	I guess maybe by the time E3 or whatever the hell it is.
4222263	4223705	Honestly though, I mean, come on.
4224065	4229329	I mean, think of all the things that we probably would have expected with the 360 version.
4229369	4233193	I mean, really, the 360 version is just a prettied up version of the Xbox One.
4233793	4244142	And the one for the Nintendo Wii when it comes out, it's pretty much just PlayStation 2 version of Supernova with Wiimote crap thrown on there.
4244162	4244422	It's just...
4245237	4247119	It's very... I was going to say, I guess we have Wii DDR.
4247819	4250582	It's very... I don't know.
4250762	4252303	Very non-innovative.
4252503	4260830	I mean, granted, yeah, great, you're doing stuff with the Wiimote, but you don't... I don't think you really need to do stuff with the Wiimote.
4260890	4262251	I mean, it's just like the iToy.
4262811	4264293	Yeah, the iToy support was there.
4264813	4265614	It was ridiculous.
4267015	4268976	Not even remotely fun.
4269016	4270518	It made you look like a complete ass.
4270878	4272159	So, I don't know.
4273100	4274341	Alright, well, anyway, sorry, we've...
4274977	4280639	We've definitely beat this story into the ground, but just a dumb comment made by that guy at Activision.
4280659	4281739	Just a dumb comment.
4283100	4285601	When have we heard much smart from that guy at Activision?
4285621	4287442	I swear, doesn't he hang out with Kutaragi?
4288142	4290883	Don't know, maybe they all have a secret bar they drink at all day.
4291123	4292163	You mean crayon juice?
4293124	4299526	Anyway, something though that's pretty cool, well at least if you're into it, is that...
4300759	4305242	S&K Playmore is to be releasing... A new game?
4306623	4307124	Sort of.
4309105	4315129	They're doing Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1, which is Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury 2, Fatal Fury 3, and Fatal Fury Special.
4315530	4316710	Oh, so close!
4319352	4321354	But hey, we get old school, my booty.
4321694	4324476	Are they going to be redoing any of the graphics whatsoever?
4325857	4326137	No.
4327238	4327618	Okay.
4327638	4327718	Okay.
4329133	4330454	But that'd be arcade quality.
4330694	4331274	Oh, whoopee.
4332375	4333855	Didn't those games come out 10 years ago?
4333995	4336157	Seriously, Fatal Fury Special, I think, came out in 95.
4336517	4341199	To give them credit, their Art of Fighting collection was only $14.99 for the PlayStation 2.
4341659	4349423	You know the one thing that I liked about the Fatal Fury games that I thought was innovative was the, for old 2D fighters, was having the multi-plane.
4350344	4354386	You know, you couldn't really tell which plane they were on, but you had the front and back.
4355326	4357387	Oh, I love Fatal Fury, don't get me wrong.
4357427	4358728	It was my favorite, like,
4360382	4362763	Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat were kind of up on this.
4362883	4364845	Actually, Street Fighter was up on a freaking pedestal.
4364905	4366346	Mortal Kombat was close behind.
4366706	4370108	And then he had all these other knockoff fighting games below, right?
4370208	4371149	In the 90s, right?
4371549	4373510	I would say Fatal Fury was my favorite of that bunch.
4374311	4376252	More so than anything else SNK put out.
4376292	4379574	Fatal Fury paved the way for King of Fighters, and that makes me happy.
4380235	4383617	No, here's what SNK needs to do.
4384077	4386259	I mean, great, you're releasing games and stuff.
4386872	4389753	Just re-release, like, Neo Geo collections.
4389853	4392354	You know, have, you know, Magical Lord.
4392474	4394375	Have, you know, the Fatal Fear games.
4394575	4395215	Metal Slug.
4395616	4397957	You know, all this stuff together.
4398657	4402278	Instead of just, here's two games that you bought before.
4402378	4403559	Here's Metal Slug yet again.
4403619	4404699	Here's, you know, this stuff.
4405159	4407260	And then add some... Yeah, but who really bought that stuff?
4407280	4408201	Those cartridges were like $500.
4408421	4409681	Exactly.
4409981	4412502	But still, though, they've re... You are a crazy bitch.
4412522	4413783	You're in your own category.
4413803	4416484	But still, though, they've re-released these games numerous times.
4417259	4419360	To be honest, a lot of them we got through trade.
4419520	4423642	The only one that we paid over $300 for was King of Fighters 2000.
4424103	4424463	Only?
4425443	4428905	I see a $60 Xbox 360 game and I cry.
4429545	4432167	But yeah, but we have a lot more bills now, so we don't do that anymore.
4433287	4435088	Except I really want Samurai Shodown 5.
4436449	4436869	Really.
4437429	4438550	It was the last Neo Geo game.
4438570	4439530	You will play it once.
4439690	4440611	You will play it once.
4440691	4441431	The fuck I will?
4441451	4444493	And then put it in a glass case and say, I own it and you don't.
4444753	4445854	The fuck I will?
4445974	4446254	No.
4446274	4446294	I...
4447242	4448343	Are we rated M today?
4448503	4449384	Yeah.
4449424	4449824	Kinda.
4450284	4455688	Rated M. Yeah, we're rated M. Yeah, ooh, watch out, that ESRB's on our ass.
4455708	4458490	We're rated I for... Wait, we're not a game, dumbass!
4458510	4459491	You can't play through us!
4460191	4461632	We're rated I for immature.
4462633	4463594	Thanks to Loki.
4464874	4466956	Something's telling me we need a little bit of a break.
4467356	4467757	No!
4467917	4468917	I think now's a good time.
4469158	4470338	We're gonna break you.
4471019	4471679	Break you back.
4471699	4472400	I will break you.
4473200	4473941	I will break you.
4475362	4480504	Alright, we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.
