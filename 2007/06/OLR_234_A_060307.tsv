7000	13000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Molochi
14000	18000	Tonight, June 3rd, 2007, rumors surfaced about Mario Kart Wii,
18000	21000	lizard strikes against gold farmers for WoW,
21000	25000	and a famous 80's movie is about to be made into a PC game.
25000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet,
33000	36000	and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	40000	You should know by now that we're that podcast dedicated to video games,
40000	43000	video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	47000	We'll be here with you for the next few hours in two parts of a show
47000	50000	to talk about the latest and what's going on in the gaming world.
50000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts.
51000	55000	Say hello also to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
55000	56000	Beer!
56000	58000	Beer! It's what's tasty.
58000	60000	That was my weekend, was beer.
60000	62000	Actually, I don't really care for much beer,
62000	64000	except for Guinness, which isn't a beer, it's stout.
64000	66000	No, no, you need to have Newcastle.
66000	69000	I've had Newcastle, I like Newcastle. Newcastle is permissible.
69000	72000	I actually got my husband to like a beer.
72000	73000	What's that?
73000	74000	He likes Killian's Red.
74000	78000	See, if I'm gonna drink, I'm gonna drink something that's actually going to get me drunk,
78000	80000	therefore beer doesn't work.
80000	81000	Depends on what you drink.
81000	82000	Yeah, I mean Guinness.
82000	83000	Chimay.
83000	84000	Well, maybe.
84000	85000	Chimay.
85000	88000	Anyhow, suddenly we've become the food and beverage podcast.
88000	92000	Over there chomping on some food is the one and only Loki.
92000	94000	It's dinner, that's what it is.
94000	96000	And Loki's mic needs to be on.
96000	98000	You think after five years he'd know this?
98000	100000	I expected it to be on for me.
100000	101000	Is it beef?
101000	103000	That's what I have servants for, is a turn on the mic.
103000	106000	Oh yes, let's forget the OLR interns, of which we have none.
106000	107000	Is it beef?
107000	108000	It is beefy.
108000	109000	So it's for dinner.
109000	114000	Great, so we have beer, beef sandwiches from Quiznos, toasty...
114000	115000	It smells very good.
115000	116000	It does.
116000	117000	I had a burrito.
117000	118000	I had a fish burrito.
118000	119000	I had a burger from Chili's.
119000	122000	I did a massage today and got paid with fish.
122000	126000	Alright, we'll let the listeners take that however they want.
126000	129000	Speaking of listeners, if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening, because
129000	135000	we do record live every Sunday night at OrangeloungeRadio.com, you can join our chatroom.
135000	139000	OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to be, it'll take you right into our chatroom thanks
139000	140000	to Java.
140000	143000	But if you need the information about IRC, it's all on there as well.
143000	147000	You just connect to Game Surge and Channel Orange Lounge.
147000	149000	Anyhow, let's get into the show.
149000	152000	We always like to start it off with a little bit of how is your gaming week?
152000	154000	So we'll start it off with Dark Sakura.
154000	155000	How was your gaming week?
155000	157000	More Marvel Ultimate Alliance and more Pinball, same as usual.
157000	159000	Haven't you beat the damn game yet?
159000	163000	No, because I keep taking my time playing it, and then I go back and start over to do
163000	167000	the levels with other characters to try to figure out all the funny crap they're saying,
167000	170000	but usually I just play with Deadpool and Iron Man.
170000	171000	Gotcha.
171000	175000	Yeah, I actually need to completely redo the Mandarin level with Iron Man because I had
175000	178000	him in the Ultimate outfit, so it's like, dude, you're a different universe, I don't
178000	179000	know who you are.
179000	183000	I was actually tempted to buy Marvel Ultimate Alliance the other day.
183000	185000	Get it on Xbox 360, because I am.
185000	190000	But see, I was also tempted to buy Dead or Alive Extreme 2, so therefore something's
190000	192000	obviously wrong with me.
192000	193000	Boobies.
193000	194000	I need to save money.
194000	195000	Video games are expensive.
195000	196000	Boobies!
196000	197000	Video games are really expensive.
197000	198000	I know.
198000	202000	We don't talk about that enough on this show, but they are freaking expensive.
202000	204000	I have my Pokemans.
204000	208000	I've been going to the gym, I'm back to going to the gym now that my doctor's
208000	211000	giving me the okay, so I get on the recumbent bike and play with my Pokemans.
211000	213000	What's a recumbent bike?
213000	216000	The recumbent bike is where you sit down like you're in a chair.
216000	217000	Sounds dirty.
217000	221000	Well, you know a standard stationary bike has you upright.
221000	223000	Recumbent means leaning back.
223000	224000	Oh, okay.
224000	226000	So I go on the recumbent bike.
226000	229000	So it's like one of those boats that you pedal like.
229000	232000	Or those lame-ass bikes that you see people pedaling.
232000	235000	They're sitting back and it looks stupid and unstable.
235000	236000	Oh, on the streets and stuff.
236000	239000	It actually works out your legs, though, a different way.
239000	243000	Because I have to work back into my whole routine, I'm doing the recumbent bike so
243000	247000	I can sit down and play with my Pokemans, because you cannot play Pokemans on the elliptical.
247000	249000	Yeah, that would be kind of tough.
249000	251000	You can't even freaking read on the elliptical.
251000	253000	It's like, I've got to move my arms, too.
253000	254000	Shit.
254000	259000	But you could listen to great podcasts such as this one you're listening to right now.
259000	261000	Why would I want to listen to us?
261000	262000	I don't know.
262000	264000	I listen to us every Sunday.
264000	265000	I don't know.
265000	270000	Maybe you want to listen to the playback to see what you can do better.
270000	273000	I do everything perfect.
273000	274000	I don't know.
274000	276000	There might be some emailers out there that beg to differ.
276000	278000	Our emailers say that I'm fabulous.
278000	281000	We haven't gotten a good Dark Sakura hate mail in a long time.
281000	283000	This is because they know I'll kill them.
283000	284000	Get on that.
284000	286000	Hey!
286000	287000	All right.
287000	289000	Anyhow, have I pinged out of chat?
289000	291000	Chat room hasn't moved for me in a few minutes.
291000	292000	That's concerning.
292000	295000	I'll check on that while Loki talks about his gaming week.
295000	299000	Which, did it involve going to the gym?
299000	302000	I don't remember if I did go to the gym this week or not.
302000	303000	I think I did one day.
303000	304000	Oh, okay.
304000	305000	One day.
305000	309000	I don't like to, so I don't do it.
309000	315000	Anyways, so this week I played a lot of weird stuff, other than the usual stuff.
315000	317000	I played more Super Paper Mario.
317000	321000	And to be honest, it's getting very repetitive towards the end of the game.
321000	324000	Almost like they've ran out of ideas what to do.
324000	327000	It's like, well, let's just throw a hundred of these towards you.
327000	330000	And how about let's make you replay levels again.
330000	332000	And, oh, that's fun.
332000	335000	So I'll be very glad to see this game over.
335000	339000	And I'll be very glad to return it for some store credit.
339000	341000	Because it's not worth playing again.
341000	344000	Even with all the side crap, not worth it.
344000	347000	Um, let's see.
347000	350000	Then I played my PlayStation 3.
350000	352000	Yes, dusted that thing off.
352000	354000	And then did a nice old firmware update.
354000	359000	And then created myself a Japanese account to download folklore.
359000	362000	And I played it, and it's pretty fun.
362000	366000	Although, since it's in Japanese, I have no idea what the storyline is.
366000	369000	What is this game all about? Because I know nothing about it.
369000	371000	Well, I'm not really sure.
371000	373000	Like I said, because it's all in Japanese.
373000	375000	But there's two different characters you get to play as.
375000	378000	I played through as the guy in the game.
378000	383000	And what you're doing is kind of stealing the souls of these critters that you kill.
383000	386000	Like different enemies, almost like in Final Fantasy.
386000	389000	And you gain abilities that they have.
389000	392000	And you use those as your attacks throughout the game.
392000	395000	So, once you've gotten some abilities and stuff,
395000	399000	you can go and kill larger things and gain their abilities.
399000	402000	But what's kind of neat about it is, once you've killed it,
402000	406000	you actually have to use the six axis tilt stuff in there
406000	410000	to actually physically rip the soul out of whatever it is that you're doing.
410000	412000	So, it's kind of neat.
412000	415000	But then again, there's this one that I couldn't figure out how to do.
415000	418000	I could get it for about five minutes before it finally ripped out of its body.
418000	423000	But I'm sure there's something that I'm just not getting in the translation of the game.
423000	426000	Speaking of all this shaking and body parts and stuff,
426000	428000	what do you know about the Mortal Kombat Armageddon on the Wii?
428000	430000	Because I'm really tempted to get it.
430000	433000	It looks awesome and apparently it's pretty easy to play because of the controls.
433000	434000	Really?
434000	435000	Yeah.
435000	437000	I'm tempted to play.
437000	439000	Plus it has motor combat and you can use your...
439000	441000	That's true.
441000	446000	But I guess it's supposed to be sort of controlled almost like...
446000	447000	Not necessarily...
447000	449000	I guess like a little bit.
449000	452000	I played the one on PlayStation 2 and it was decent.
452000	454000	There was a lot of stuff they crammed into one,
454000	458000	considering it was on the current gen consoles or whatever.
458000	460000	They really crammed a lot into it.
460000	463000	So, I'm interested in checking out the one on the Wii.
463000	465000	I hear it's pretty cool though.
465000	469000	Just some of the descriptions and they have a little gameplay video there
469000	471000	showing how you would play the game and stuff.
471000	472000	It looked very simple.
472000	474000	Even I would be able to pick it up.
474000	477000	I was looking at that list of fatalities that went out to the internet this week.
477000	480000	For some reason, we get Midway press releases all the time,
480000	482000	which is pretty much the same things you end up seeing
482000	485000	because game blogs just copy paste what they're sending out in the press release.
485000	488000	So, we get those same things, but we never get free games from Midway.
488000	489000	Ever.
489000	490000	Right?
490000	491000	I do.
491000	493000	Oh, well, lucky you.
493000	495000	I mean, yeah.
495000	498000	I got, let's see, what, Spy Hunter?
498000	499000	Whoo!
499000	500000	Rampage!
500000	501000	Whoo!
501000	502000	Actually, I take that back.
502000	503000	I did get free games from Midway once
503000	506000	because there's this very sweet gal that worked there that I met at some trade show
506000	510000	and she hooked me up with the classic game archives, which I really like.
510000	512000	Midway put out some of my favorite stuff in the 80s.
512000	518000	So, the only thing that I complain about, about those classic compilations,
518000	522000	is that I have yet to see Journey, the arcade game, show up in one of them,
522000	525000	even though it ran on the same hardware as Timber and all that other stuff.
525000	528000	Well, you've got the licensing rights and stuff.
528000	529000	Who cares?
529000	530000	Anyways.
530000	533000	If they can get Tron on Xbox Live, I can get Journey on Xbox Live.
533000	534000	Stop.
534000	535000	Don't stop believing.
535000	537000	I will hold on to that feeling.
537000	539000	You do that, sir.
539000	543000	So, then I also played, well, I downloaded a bunch of Japanese demos.
543000	547000	I downloaded the Hot Shots Golf 5 demo, so I haven't played that,
547000	550000	or, I guess, Mino no Golf 5.
550000	554000	And then I also downloaded some weird, I don't even know what the fuck it is.
554000	557000	It's kind of like their mascot in Japan, like some cat thing that you have.
557000	561000	You basically raise it and it reads you Japanese news or something.
561000	564000	Is that the white cat with the face that was the...
564000	565000	Yeah.
565000	566000	I know what you're talking about.
566000	567000	Yeah.
567000	569000	The only problem is, in order to play that game,
569000	572000	I had to download some update or something, and it took, like, an hour to download.
572000	575000	So, I got very bored with that real quick.
575000	578000	That cat was actually based off of old text emoticons.
578000	579000	Yeah.
579000	580000	I can imagine.
580000	584000	Then, there was also, I played on the PSP.
584000	586000	Of course, Grand Theft Auto by City Stories.
586000	588000	That's not getting old yet.
588000	593000	And I actually tried out B-Boy, which is a game that's been out in Europe for a while now.
593000	595000	And it's just like it sounds.
595000	598000	It's basically a breakdancing game.
598000	602000	Not exactly like Bust-A-Mover or anything like that, but it's pretty cool.
602000	604000	It takes a lot to get used to the game, though,
604000	607000	because there's a lot of transitioning and stuff,
607000	609000	a lot of rhythm stuff in there as well.
609000	611000	But it's pretty fun.
611000	612000	So, I've got that.
612000	615000	And then, what else have I been trying to play?
615000	617000	I have the full version of LocoRoco.
617000	619000	I haven't touched that yet.
619000	621000	And then, also, Puzzle Quest.
621000	623000	I've got that on the PSP.
623000	625000	And then, I got Nellie, the DS one.
625000	627000	So, she's been playing that a little bit.
627000	629000	But she doesn't really get the game, but she's been playing it.
629000	632000	And then, of course, Earth Defense Force 2017.
632000	635000	I've been trying to finish that game up.
635000	636000	We're almost done.
636000	638000	We almost got all the weapons on it.
638000	641000	I'm just trying to finish some of these harder levels.
641000	645000	And, let's see.
645000	652000	Other than that, I think I haven't really been playing too much else on the PS3.
652000	659000	I did happen to dump, though, a copy of Kung Pao to my PlayStation 3 hard drive,
659000	662000	just to test out, you know, putting movies on there.
662000	664000	And it's a bitch to figure out how to do it,
664000	670000	because it requires you, and I didn't realize this until, you know, after lots of reading,
670000	674000	but apparently, in order for the PlayStation 3 to see your movies,
674000	677000	you have to have a folder on whatever drive you're using,
677000	682000	like a jump drive or something that's named Video, or Videos, I believe.
682000	685000	And you have to put the file in there.
685000	689000	So, I didn't know that, and so I've been kind of banging my head against the wall
689000	691000	trying to figure out how to get this thing to work,
691000	693000	because I'm like, well, I converted it, right?
693000	696000	So, finally, I figured out that's what I needed to do.
696000	698000	It works like a charm now, so.
698000	700000	But, pretty awesome.
700000	701000	Awesome.
701000	703000	So, lots of hacking and stuff in your wake, it sounds like.
703000	709000	Lots, yes, and this is only going to be a gateway to putting porn on the PS3 now, so.
709000	712000	All right, I'm glad you, at least you have a goal in mind.
712000	713000	That's good to have goals.
713000	714000	You've got to have goals.
714000	718000	Looking at the chat room for some feedback here, SSJ100Matt says,
718000	720000	That's not a surprise, Loki. It's the same with the PSP.
720000	724000	But, see, that's the thing with the PSP is I put it in the video folder for the PSP,
724000	728000	because the PSP is even worse than the PS3 as far as how strict, you know,
728000	731000	what folders and the file names and stuff like that.
731000	734000	So, I thought, okay, well, I'll just throw it in there and see if that works.
734000	736000	Nope, that didn't work either.
736000	740000	So, I actually had to use, it was funny, my camcorder that I have,
740000	743000	because the batteries don't work in it anymore.
743000	746000	So, I just plugged that in, and now it's a 20 gig jump drive.
746000	751000	TheRobD in chat says, The PS3 is a gateway for porn.
751000	755000	And, by the way, the PS3 is fucking easy to download demos of the Japanese accounts.
755000	757000	It's so easy to create one.
757000	760000	There's no restrictions whatsoever, and you can download all your games.
760000	766000	Just like the Xbox 360, anything you download on the Japanese accounts is playable on all accounts.
766000	767000	Nice.
767000	768000	It's easy.
768000	769000	All right, good tip.
769000	772000	My gaming week was pretty short. There wasn't a lot to it.
772000	774000	I've been playing a lot more World of Warcraft.
774000	778000	I hit level 55. I've been grinding a lot this week, trying to get to Outlands.
778000	781000	I want to get to 58 very bad, because a lot of the guild, which, by the way,
781000	783000	our guild blew up in the past couple of weeks.
783000	784000	We have tons more people on the guild, though.
784000	785000	I played.
785000	786000	I know, I saw you on the other night.
786000	787000	Yeah, I forgot to say that I played.
787000	790000	Yeah, for like half a second, though, because then Shane kicked me off my computer,
790000	793000	because he wanted to get on and kick people out of the guild or whatever,
793000	795000	because Shane is actually the guild leader.
795000	796000	I didn't get kicked.
796000	797000	So, he was a tyrant.
797000	799000	He booted three people one night, but it was a joke.
799000	800000	It was funny.
800000	801000	It was funny.
801000	804000	So, yeah, I've been working on that, because a lot of the guild is in Shane,
804000	807000	and some of them are in Outlands now, and they won't shut up about how awesome
807000	810000	the Outlands are and how they're never going back to the old world.
810000	813000	So, I'm working on it, trying to get there.
813000	815000	You went to Outworld?
815000	817000	Is that Mortal Kombat or Outlands?
817000	819000	Sorry, I got my Mortal Kombat mixed up with my...
819000	820000	No, you said Outlands.
820000	821000	Did I?
821000	822000	I said Outworld.
822000	824000	I wouldn't surprise me if I screwed something up.
824000	826000	I usually do.
826000	830000	But then, besides World of Warcraft, I've been spending a whole lot of gaming time
830000	832000	playing something on the Wii.
832000	834000	Anybody?
834000	835000	Actraiser?
835000	836000	That's right.
836000	838000	I've been playing Actraiser all freaking week.
838000	839000	I love Actraiser.
839000	843000	I'm so happy the game finally came out on Memorial Day,
843000	845000	because Actraiser needed its own holiday.
845000	846000	It's that freaking good.
846000	847000	So, I was very happy.
847000	852000	So, for those that were wondering if I was happy that finally Actraiser came
852000	855000	to the Virtual Console, yes, I'm very pleased.
855000	857000	Perfect translation of the Super Nintendo game.
857000	858000	Same music I love.
858000	863000	Same easy-ass game I remember that's not challenging one bit.
863000	866000	You can kind of play through it in one sitting if you have some time.
866000	867000	But I love it.
867000	868000	I love it.
868000	870000	All right.
870000	874000	So, why don't we get into some housekeeping, then we'll get into some news.
874000	879000	First off, excuse me, in housekeeping, June 10th, which is next week,
879000	881000	there's no show.
881000	883000	There will be no live show, and there will be no podcast.
883000	887000	We mentioned this at the end of our show that we taped live last week at Fanime,
887000	889000	but just a reminder, there is no show next week.
889000	892000	Very sorry to the live listeners and the podcasters,
892000	896000	but since I'm traveling, it's going to kind of screw up the rhythm of everything,
896000	900000	and I'm gone for so long that we can't pre-taper anything as well.
900000	901000	So, that's that.
901000	904000	But I will be in New York City for some of the East Coasters that want to meet up,
904000	908000	and we're looking at doing something on Sunday afternoon-ish.
908000	912000	So, check the forums for more details or the live journal.
912000	915000	So, sorry to the live listeners, because I know the live listeners kind of got
915000	918000	screwed last week because we did our thing live at Fanime,
918000	920000	but yeah, unfortunately, we won't have a show next week.
920000	924000	But we will be back on June 17th, and that should be a fun show.
924000	927000	And then June 24th is the fifth anniversary show of Orange Lounge Radio,
927000	929000	the official fifth anniversary.
929000	931000	But I should mention that the live station,
931000	934000	which went up a little bit earlier than we actually did a live show,
934000	937000	because remember, our station was up for a little while to promote that we were
937000	940000	going to be doing a live show back in 2002.
940000	943000	Our live station turned five years old this week on May 30th,
943000	945000	so happy birthday to the live station.
945000	947000	But we'll be officially celebrating on the 24th.
947000	949000	How? I don't know.
949000	951000	But I should say about the live station,
951000	954000	in a nod to how we kind of launched ourselves,
954000	958000	the old playlist from 2002 with the dance mania music and all that
958000	960000	is back in rotation.
960000	963000	So that's kind of fun for those folks that listened to OLR a long time ago
963000	965000	or wanted to know what it used to sound like,
965000	969000	except you have to remember it was on a dial-up stream when it first started.
969000	971000	The audio quality was horrible.
971000	973000	So you're actually getting the old playlist with the new quality,
973000	975000	so it's kind of cool.
975000	976000	So that's that.
976000	979000	Visit ORANGELONITARADY.COM if you want more information.
979000	982000	And of course everybody in chat is kind of crying.
982000	984000	Chainsaw Juggling says boo.
984000	986000	Shadow Charlie says since I'm traveling also,
986000	988000	I won't have to worry about it.
988000	989000	There you go.
989000	991000	Sorry guys, but surely you understand.
991000	993000	We need vacations too.
993000	996000	All right, so let's get into some gaming news.
996000	998000	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
998000	1002000	And there's some interesting news, not surprising at all.
1002000	1007000	But according to the website Jute France,
1007000	1011000	they have run into a credible rumor, they say,
1011000	1014000	that says that Nintendo's going to drop the bomb at EA,
1014000	1018000	or not EA, E3, mini E3 I guess,
1018000	1021000	that they're going to be announcing a brand new Mario Kart game for the Wii.
1021000	1024000	I mean, come on, it's only a matter of time
1024000	1026000	before a Mario Kart game comes out for the Wii.
1026000	1029000	Hopefully it's not part of the arcade game, but who knows.
1029000	1034000	The other rumor is that there's going to be some new hardware news as well.
1034000	1037000	Whether this be like a revision to the current Wii hardware,
1037000	1039000	something altogether new,
1039000	1043000	or possibly, you know, I'm thinking maybe it's a DVD playback,
1043000	1046000	something like that, but no idea.
1046000	1049000	I mean, obviously there's going to be some announcements at E3,
1049000	1055000	but, you know, Mario Kart if that happens, I'm not too surprised.
1055000	1063000	Besides, this is why I buy every damn system that Nintendo puts out for Mario Kart.
1063000	1066000	I mean, it seems like a foregone conclusion to me.
1066000	1069000	I mean, obviously this game is coming out on the Wii at some point, right?
1069000	1070000	Yeah.
1070000	1071000	It's just a matter of time.
1071000	1076000	That's like saying a Mario game is coming out on a Nintendo system.
1076000	1078000	And then the, uh, okay? Yeah.
1078000	1080000	Of course there's a Mario game coming out.
1080000	1082000	Alright, you guys heard it here first.
1082000	1085000	There's going to be a new Zelda game coming out on the Wii at some point.
1085000	1088000	We don't know much more about it, but there will be another Zelda game on the Wii.
1088000	1090000	So Mario beat that to that, I think.
1090000	1091000	God damn it.
1091000	1094000	Alright, you heard it here first.
1094000	1099000	Final Fantasy XIV will be coming out to some console at some point.
1099000	1101000	Absolutely definitive news.
1101000	1103000	Wouldn't it be funny if that was a PC game?
1103000	1105000	That wouldn't be a console.
1105000	1109000	Stop trying to screw our exclusive news, you bastard.
1109000	1113000	Alright, speaking of the, you know what's funny about,
1113000	1118000	I was trying to figure out if that was the same site that a long time ago,
1118000	1126000	it was like in 2005, I got an email from some French website about E3,
1126000	1128000	but they actually didn't mean to send it to me.
1128000	1131000	They meant to send it to some staffer that had a very similar name to me,
1131000	1133000	like it was a missent email to my Gmail box.
1133000	1134000	It was the weirdest thing ever.
1134000	1137000	But I ended up writing the guy back, and he spoke English luckily,
1137000	1139000	and I ended up giving the site pictures from E3.
1139000	1140000	I don't know if it was the same site.
1140000	1142000	I know it was like a French Nintendo only site,
1142000	1144000	because they only used the pictures from the Nintendo booth
1144000	1145000	that I took that year.
1145000	1147000	It was so interesting.
1147000	1149000	Anyway, not that anybody cares,
1149000	1151000	but this whole thing kind of made me think about that.
1151000	1152000	Well, that's special.
1152000	1153000	Stop looking at me funny.
1153000	1154000	I hate you.
1154000	1155000	I'm not looking at you funny.
1155000	1156000	Yes, you are.
1156000	1157000	No, I'm not.
1157000	1158000	Alright.
1158000	1159000	You are too.
1159000	1160000	No.
1160000	1161000	Alright.
1161000	1162000	I thought you were going to say Wee Wee.
1162000	1163000	What did you say?
1163000	1164000	No, it would be Mae Wee.
1164000	1165000	The French site is not Wee Wee.
1165000	1166000	Oh my God.
1166000	1170000	Anyhow, also talking about Nintendo and Virtual Console,
1170000	1176000	obviously I was very happy that Actraiser was like the 99th Virtual Console title to be released,
1176000	1181000	but that means that this Monday the 100th Virtual Console title will be released,
1181000	1186000	and they've already announced it's going to be Zelda II The Adventure of Link.
1186000	1187000	So there you have it.
1187000	1190000	So that is coming out on, I believe, what, June 4th?
1190000	1193000	Am I one of the only people that doesn't like that game?
1193000	1194000	Yes.
1194000	1196000	Well, you know what?
1196000	1198000	No, you're not, because I've been reading game blogs,
1198000	1200000	and a lot of people have been kind of saying like,
1200000	1202000	oh, it's one of the weaker Zelda games in the franchise.
1202000	1204000	No, that was the CDI.
1204000	1207000	It was just different, but if you think about it,
1207000	1210000	weren't all the sequels on Nintendo really different?
1210000	1213000	Super Mario Bros. 2, very different from 1, yes?
1213000	1216000	Super Mario Bros. 2 was not Super Mario Bros.
1216000	1217000	Right, it was the whole...
1217000	1219000	There was a Super Mario 2 in Japan.
1219000	1220000	Doki Doki Panic or whatever.
1220000	1221000	Right.
1221000	1222000	That was just like the first one.
1222000	1223000	I didn't say all that international garbage.
1223000	1225000	I said here in the U.S.
1225000	1228000	But the Zelda game was released in Japan as a Zelda sequel.
1228000	1229000	Okay, how about this?
1229000	1230000	Simon's Quest.
1230000	1232000	Completely different from the first Castlevania.
1232000	1233000	That is true, but you can...
1233000	1235000	And completely better.
1235000	1236000	True.
1236000	1237000	I have to agree with that.
1237000	1239000	It was better than the first, you know,
1239000	1241000	Demon Castle Dracula.
1241000	1243000	Oh, whatever, Miss Prim and Proper.
1243000	1244000	Whatever.
1244000	1246000	Miss, I play nothing but import games my entire life.
1246000	1247000	I do not play nothing but import games.
1247000	1248000	All right, so there you go.
1248000	1254000	Yeah, the Rob D says, well, excuse me, Dark Sakura.
1254000	1257000	I want to make that a sound file.
1257000	1259000	I need to find that old clip from the old 80s Zelda.
1259000	1261000	Just replace Princess with Dark Sakura.
1261000	1263000	Or leave it at Princess.
1263000	1264000	It would be appropriate.
1264000	1265000	That's right.
1265000	1266000	Pay me my respect.
1266000	1267000	So there you go.
1267000	1270000	Nintendo is putting out Zelda 2, the Adventure Link,
1270000	1271000	and blah, blah, blah.
1271000	1273000	They're bragging that the internet connection range is 40%.
1273000	1275000	They're more happy, though, for our friends in the U.K.
1275000	1280000	For the European Virtual Console, I should guess I should say Europe.
1280000	1287000	But there are going to be some pretty fun stuff coming out over on the Virtual Console.
1287000	1292000	You get Streets of Rage 2, which I love the Streets of Rage games.
1292000	1293000	They're really fun.
1293000	1295000	That's because Dark Sakura has Rage.
1295000	1296000	I do.
1296000	1297000	Well, you're unlucky.
1297000	1299000	You can actually play it over here.
1299000	1305000	Also, another Mega Drive game to be out is ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron.
1305000	1308000	Yeah, I like ToeJam & Earl, too.
1308000	1310000	That game was really fun.
1310000	1313000	Boy, they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for Genesis games, aren't they?
1313000	1315000	No, it was a good game.
1315000	1321000	And then Kid Chameleon was actually a game that I played partly through, anyway.
1321000	1325000	And then coming from the TurboGrafx-16,
1325000	1328000	it looks like there's World of Sports Competition,
1328000	1330000	which is a little shit.
1330000	1333000	And that's about it.
1333000	1335000	Are you saying that just because it's a sports game?
1335000	1338000	Because there's some pretty awesome old-school sports games I'm waiting for.
1338000	1340000	I did not like World of Sports Competition.
1340000	1342000	It ranked right there below Keith Courage.
1342000	1345000	However, now that I have Act Racer,
1345000	1348000	now what Virtual Console game will I complain about?
1348000	1350000	Well, obviously, there's The Guardian Legend,
1350000	1352000	which I will be complaining about forever.
1352000	1355000	But since that doesn't seem as realistic as this one,
1355000	1358000	I want Blades of Steel on Virtual Console.
1358000	1360000	Hecka bad, Blades of Steel.
1360000	1363000	If you're listening, Konami, Nintendo, make it happen.
1363000	1364000	Thank you.
1364000	1366000	Let's see, also looking in the chat room,
1366000	1368000	they're still talking about Zelda II.
1368000	1369000	Jack Ransom says,
1369000	1373000	Remember when Zelda II came out on the European Virtual Console in January?
1373000	1375000	Yeah, they got it a long time ago, so did Japan.
1375000	1377000	We've been having to wait this whole time.
1377000	1381000	Rama says Zelda II was underrated and by far was one of the better titles.
1381000	1382000	No, it wasn't.
1382000	1383000	No, it wasn't.
1383000	1384000	Yes, it was!
1384000	1385000	It was not one of the better titles.
1385000	1387000	It was okay, but it was like...
1387000	1389000	I will say it was pretty good.
1389000	1392000	His sword looked like a fucking dagger throughout the whole game.
1392000	1393000	It was weird.
1393000	1394000	I don't know.
1394000	1397000	I have found some fun hacks for that game, though.
1397000	1398000	Hmm.
1398000	1401000	Like the penis hack.
1401000	1404000	I remember I got stuck on like the fifth part of the game
1404000	1409000	where I couldn't figure out jumping down the...
1409000	1410000	What was it, the chimney?
1410000	1412000	Yeah.
1412000	1414000	Where you had to climb up on top of the house,
1414000	1416000	but you had to get the double jump to do it.
1416000	1418000	I think, yeah.
1418000	1419000	Yeah.
1419000	1421000	I actually ended up...
1421000	1429000	I don't know how, but I skipped random levels on that.
1429000	1431000	I'll probably download it.
1431000	1434000	I need to burn through this last 1200, you know, points.
1434000	1435000	Yes, I said penis.
1435000	1436000	Shut up.
1436000	1439000	I was looking on a virtual console and there's like nothing I want.
1439000	1443000	I need like Paper Mario or maybe Super Mario RPG.
1443000	1445000	Preferably Super Mario RPG.
1445000	1448000	Hey, you never know if Squeenix put Actraiser on there finally.
1448000	1450000	There's always a chance.
1450000	1451000	There's a chance.
1451000	1454000	What about the regular Mario Kart, not Mario Kart 64?
1454000	1456000	That needs to come on there.
1456000	1458000	Well, if it's true there's a Mario Kart Wii in the future,
1458000	1461000	I would think they would time that around the release of Mario Kart Wii, right?
1461000	1464000	Yeah, I guess I gotta wait until August, too, for all the Metroid games.
1464000	1468000	GS68, by the way, stop doing the freaking color over your text,
1468000	1470000	but you do make a good point.
1470000	1473000	I did have the best ending thing when you died.
1473000	1475000	Game over, Return of Ganon.
1475000	1477000	That's right, when you died it would say,
1477000	1480000	Game over, Return of Ganon, he's killed everybody,
1480000	1483000	he's murdered the children, he's raped the babies,
1483000	1485000	and it's all because of you.
1485000	1488000	And next time you do the colored, you know, text like that,
1488000	1490000	I'm gonna kick you.
1490000	1491000	Wonder Dog Harold wants to know
1491000	1493000	when the heck Zombie Ate My Neighbors is coming to the virtual console.
1493000	1495000	Oh my God, that was the best game ever.
1495000	1497000	Hostile One wants RC Pro-Am.
1497000	1499000	That's a good choice, but that's a rare game, right?
1499000	1502000	I want Fester's Quest.
1502000	1504000	That's the most random title to me.
1504000	1506000	Hey, it was good, Blaster Master.
1506000	1507000	No it wasn't.
1507000	1508000	We need Blaster Master.
1508000	1512000	Oh, fuck Blades of Steel, I want Blaster Master.
1512000	1516000	Never mind, scratch my earlier comment.
1516000	1519000	Blades of Steel can fucking wait, I want Blaster Master.
1519000	1523000	And, Blaster Master has to have the grenade trick.
1523000	1526000	Every time, yeah, yeah, the way you pause it,
1526000	1529000	over and over on the big jellyfish guy and some of the other bosses.
1529000	1531000	And it explodes him faster.
1531000	1532000	Okay, here's the thing though,
1532000	1535000	is that like every time the virtual console comes up,
1535000	1537000	we keep bitching and whining about the games we want to see.
1537000	1540000	So, let's move on, shall we?
1540000	1544000	They also need to change the way I can find the games on the virtual console
1544000	1547000	because this ghetto JavaScript shit is lame.
1547000	1549000	Why don't you tell Fire Bulma to go to hell?
1549000	1551000	He said Blades of Steel is better than Blaster Master.
1551000	1552000	Go to hell.
1552000	1553000	Yeah, go to hell.
1553000	1555000	Go to hell and burn there.
1555000	1557000	And roast some marshmallows too.
1557000	1561000	Well, R has got to be one of the only video game podcasts out there
1561000	1563000	that just totally tells their listeners to go to hell
1563000	1565000	when we disagree with them.
1565000	1567000	That's because we're friends.
1567000	1568000	I know.
1568000	1571000	And everybody else is telling them to go to hell too.
1571000	1575000	Yay, mom mentality.
1575000	1578000	We also need to get yo-noid because I was like,
1578000	1579000	oh, you know what else was cool?
1579000	1580000	Mutant erasers.
1580000	1581000	Cool spot.
1581000	1582000	We'll just get a whole bunch,
1582000	1585000	we'll just have one week where it's all product placement.
1585000	1587000	Can we talk about new games, please?
1587000	1591000	No, let's talk about Ubisoft because they like to port over crappy games.
1591000	1593000	Go to hell.
1593000	1597000	So Ubisoft admits that they were over-porting some of their GameCube games
1597000	1602000	to the Wii, or not necessarily GameCube games, but Xbox and you name it.
1602000	1607000	I mean, with such wonderful games as Far Cry Vengeance,
1607000	1613000	which, two-player multiplayer deathmatch, that's uber lame.
1613000	1616000	Okay, uber lame.
1616000	1621000	Prince of Persia Rival Swords, which is just two thrones all over again.
1621000	1623000	I thought you were going to say Rival Schools, and I'm like,
1623000	1624000	that would be great.
1624000	1625000	No, not Rival Schools.
1625000	1628000	And then, of course, they may apologize now,
1628000	1632000	but Driver Parallel Lines is coming out later on in June,
1632000	1634000	so they're still not done that.
1634000	1638000	And then, of course, there's also the Monster 4x4 World Circuit,
1638000	1640000	which is a crappy Xbox game.
1640000	1644000	Then there was also that GT game, which was also a GameCube game,
1644000	1646000	that also sucked.
1646000	1648000	Just stop porting over crappy games.
1648000	1653000	Seriously, make some new stuff, and make it better than Red Steel.
1653000	1657000	I mean, was anyone really surprised by this news that Ubisoft kind of admitted,
1657000	1659000	yeah, we just ported over some of our old shit.
1659000	1662000	We were in a hurry to capitalize on all this stuff.
1662000	1664000	Ubisoft, thank you for sucking.
1664000	1668000	I mean, these games were bad for even GameCube games.
1668000	1671000	They were crappy.
1671000	1674000	But Wii Remote Control, Wii.
1674000	1679000	Yeah, I liked Far Cry, you know, on the Xbox 360.
1679000	1682000	On the Wii, it was a whole different game.
1682000	1684000	It was just ew.
1684000	1687000	All right, well, boo to you Ubisoft,
1687000	1689000	and usually you'd think we'd put the FUs of the Week right here,
1689000	1691000	but we saved it for later.
1691000	1693000	I'm looking in chat.
1693000	1695000	They're still talking about Virtual Console, but I love this comment.
1695000	1700000	The Rob D says, we need Miss World 96 Nude on the Virtual Console,
1700000	1706000	which is one of the greatest MAME games you could possibly play on that emulator.
1706000	1708000	It's fabulous.
1708000	1711000	Is that the one where it's like kicks, but then at random points?
1711000	1713000	That's Gals Panic.
1713000	1717000	No, but there's one, and then it flips over to the real demon face
1717000	1719000	with the blood pouring down his face.
1719000	1721000	Everybody move your body.
1721000	1723000	It's like this really horrible techno song.
1723000	1725000	Yeah, that's the game.
1725000	1729000	That's my favorite game on that MAME emulator ever,
1729000	1731000	because it's so random.
1731000	1735000	You have all these pictures of MAME, MAME, whatever, right?
1735000	1737000	Well, the E stands for emulator.
1737000	1739000	Whatever, so I'm being redundant.
1739000	1741000	It's like ordering a cheese quesadilla. Deal with it.
1741000	1743000	Right?
1743000	1747000	So anyway, this is the best game ever.
1747000	1751000	Please, ask your parent's permission, though, if you're under 18,
1751000	1753000	because you do see titties in it.
1753000	1755000	Or sneak.
1755000	1757000	I hope that I didn't say that.
1757000	1759000	All right, yeah, the chat room's going to look for the link there.
1759000	1761000	See? Kind of love the chat.
1761000	1763000	But I want to say Rob D also says this.
1763000	1765000	He says, Skye, if you yell Dark Sakura at some point soon,
1765000	1769000	I'll have the Excuse Me Dark Sakura clip made in 10 minutes or so.
1769000	1772000	So we're going to see this unfold live while we're taping here.
1772000	1775000	So let me give you my best Dark Sakura.
1775000	1780000	Well, excuse me, Dark Sakura.
1780000	1782000	That was awful.
1782000	1784000	That was awful. You want one more?
1784000	1786000	I don't care.
1786000	1788000	Excuse me, Dark Sakura.
1788000	1790000	Dark Sakura.
1790000	1792000	How about my foot?
1792000	1794000	You know, kicking you in the head.
1794000	1796000	Hopefully that gave Rob D something to work with.
1796000	1798000	There you go.
1798000	1800000	By the way.
1800000	1802000	Yes.
1802000	1804000	Shut up.
1804000	1806000	We'll talk about Mario Party 8.
1806000	1808000	Has anyone played Mario Party 8 yet?
1808000	1809000	No.
1809000	1811000	I've heard mixed reviews on it.
1811000	1813000	I've heard some people say it was good
1813000	1815000	and some people, like reviewers, saying it sucked.
1815000	1817000	But the real people I talked to said it was good.
1817000	1819000	So I'm not sure what to believe.
1819000	1821000	I haven't played it yet.
1821000	1823000	But there it is. Mario Party 8 is out on the street.
1823000	1826000	But the reason why we're bringing this up, that's not newsworthy.
1826000	1828000	We've already talked about that.
1828000	1830000	What is newsworthy is that folks are trying to make
1830000	1834000	backup copies, quote unquote, they're making backup copies of the game
1834000	1838000	as they've made backup copies of other games.
1838000	1842000	But their backup copies of Mario Party 8 aren't working.
1842000	1845000	They're not working with the modded Wii units.
1845000	1850000	So has it been possible that Nintendo has come up with a workaround for this?
1850000	1852000	I don't know.
1852000	1855000	Or perhaps the Wii has realized that it's such a crappy game that it doesn't want to play it.
1855000	1858000	It's like, I've become smarter thanks to modding.
1858000	1861000	What is this shit that you're trying to insert into me?
1861000	1863000	Begone!
1863000	1867000	Let's see, JVMon says, I have it, Sky, it's fun.
1867000	1870000	Gerardimo says, but really boring to play by yourself.
1870000	1873000	Well, yeah, I mean, that's just Mario Party. It's a party game.
1873000	1877000	It's just like, I don't know, Rayman's Raven Rapids is kind of boring to play by yourself.
1877000	1881000	Fireboma says, because it's Mario Party, it's the same game being rehashed
1881000	1885000	over three different platforms and only remotely changes when it moves to another system.
1885000	1889000	Yeah, but the Wii, Wii-bo, Wii.
1889000	1891000	I don't know, we'll see.
1891000	1895000	And BlackDevilerX asks, Sky, are you going to be Princess Peach?
1895000	1900000	Hell yeah, I always play Princess Peach in the games because Peach is the winner.
1900000	1902000	She says so herself.
1902000	1904000	Well, then it must be true.
1904000	1905000	Right, it must be true.
1905000	1908000	Let's talk about some other games that are going to be coming out soon
1908000	1910000	besides Mario Party 8, which is already out.
1910000	1913000	Let's talk about upcoming games. We'll start over in Europe.
1913000	1916000	Your mom, the game, is coming out. No, seriously.
1916000	1921000	Actually, Loki is coming out on PC on the 4th, which has already passed.
1921000	1923000	Sorry.
1923000	1925000	No, wait, that's tomorrow, isn't it?
1925000	1928000	Well, it's already passed by the time you guys get it.
1928000	1930000	That's also Nellie's birthday, by the way.
1930000	1933000	I know. I was going to tell her happy birthday because my live journal told me.
1933000	1937000	Also coming out, though, on the 8th is Brothers in Arms DS,
1937000	1943000	Forza Motorsport 2, Halo 2 Vista Edition for PC, of course,
1943000	1946000	because Vista, you know, gives people headaches,
1946000	1950000	Mercury Meltdown Revolution on Wii, Pac-Man Rally,
1950000	1953000	Pangaea Golf with Style on Wii,
1953000	1957000	Trion Cube, and Wartec Senko Noronde.
1957000	1961000	Why is it coming out with the Japanese name in Europe?
1961000	1963000	Because that's actually, no,
1963000	1967000	Senko Noronde was the name that it was in Japan,
1967000	1970000	but they added that Wartec to the front of it because that makes people want it more
1970000	1973000	because it's got the word war in it.
1973000	1979000	Like, ooh, Wartec! Well, in that case, that must be a war game or something.
1979000	1985000	I guess. Maybe it's just that people like to have something.
1985000	1988000	It beats their last. I forget what the name before it was
1988000	1993000	because there was, like, Battlescape Senko Noronde was, at one time,
1993000	1996000	a name possibility for it.
1996000	1999000	How does it feel that you have a game named after you coming out?
1999000	2003000	I've seen screenshots of it. It's just like fucking Ragnarok.
2003000	2005000	Oh, goody.
2005000	2007000	Well, it's...
2007000	2012000	It's definitely not about me because you wouldn't be able to contain such awesomeness in the game like that.
2012000	2015000	I can understand MMO, but, you know.
2015000	2020000	SSJ100Matt says there is a code in the Loki game to unlock a Tingle costume.
2020000	2022000	So, be on the lookout.
2022000	2025000	That's reason enough to get it, I think.
2025000	2030000	One of these days, Loki, you watch. We're going to drug you and put you in the costume.
2030000	2032000	Yeah, whatever.
2032000	2036000	Anyways, so, this week we see the release in the United States
2036000	2041000	for Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition on the PlayStation 2 and PC.
2041000	2046000	Also on PC and coming to the 360, Call of Juarez,
2046000	2048000	which is pretty awesome.
2048000	2050000	First-person shooter Western game.
2050000	2053000	Hospital Tycoon for the PC.
2053000	2056000	Dragon Ball Z Haru Kannaru...
2056000	2058000	That's like a tongue-quister right there.
2058000	2061000	Haru Kannaru, I guess.
2061000	2063000	Densetsu DS.
2063000	2067000	And basically just, you know, Dragon Ball Z RPG on the DS.
2067000	2069000	Or is it a fighting game? Can't remember.
2069000	2074000	Anyways, Planet Puzzle League coming to the DS.
2074000	2079000	Another, what was that, one game?
2079000	2082000	Ah, whatever. Another rip-off of another puzzle game.
2082000	2084000	PuzzleScape coming to the PSP.
2084000	2089000	And then, of course, the Sims 2 H&M stuff.
2089000	2091000	It would have been funny if it was S&M stuff.
2091000	2093000	More Sims 2 stuff?
2093000	2094000	Yeah.
2094000	2097000	More? What is this, their 11th expansion? Geez.
2097000	2099000	Alright.
2099000	2103000	Yeah, the H&M fashion stuff.
2103000	2106000	Alright, well, moving on to Japan.
2106000	2108000	What's coming out over there?
2108000	2111000	On June 7th, Harvest Moon for the Wii comes out.
2111000	2116000	Because, you know, you just can't have a Nintendo system without a Harvest Moon game on it.
2116000	2117000	So there you go.
2117000	2120000	Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End, the Japanese version of that,
2120000	2123000	coming out on June 7th as well, also on the Wii.
2123000	2127000	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not much until the 14th,
2127000	2131000	but that's when Ninja Gaiden Sigma comes out, so look for that.
2131000	2138000	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, the Magician's Academy, also Wizardry X2.
2138000	2141000	The Wonder Price, I guess, is coming out there.
2141000	2144000	Or maybe that's just called Wonder Price because it's discounted.
2144000	2146000	That would make a lot more sense, wouldn't it?
2146000	2150000	Also coming out, because I first read it, I thought it said Wonder Prince, but I guess not.
2150000	2157000	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, you have Kabu Trader Shun is coming out from Capcom.
2157000	2160000	Kazujin Taisen coming out from Nintendo.
2160000	2166000	And also another version of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End coming out on the Nintendo DS.
2166000	2172000	Also Yoshi's Island pouches for your DS are coming out if you like Yoshi Island.
2172000	2175000	Not a game, but accessories.
2175000	2178000	You really want to insert your DS into Yoshi.
2178000	2179000	That's right.
2179000	2184000	And on the Sony PSP, Dragon Ball Z Shin Burukai 2 is coming out.
2184000	2189000	And probably the game most of you really, really care about above all this other stuff I've mentioned,
2189000	2193000	Final Fantasy II, the Anniversary Edition, comes out in Japan.
2193000	2198000	Which I have to say, I was horribly mistaken when selling stuff like that to my customers
2198000	2200000	because I thought it was just a port.
2200000	2201000	It looks pretty sexy, actually.
2201000	2204000	Oh, the new Final Fantasy games? Oh my god, they look hot.
2204000	2205000	No, they're definitely not a port.
2205000	2209000	They've redone it for the widescreen and all the graphics and everything.
2209000	2216000	They're not even ports of the ones that were on the Advance which were based off the Wonderswan ones.
2216000	2218000	They've upgraded it beyond that.
2218000	2220000	Again, this would be their third upgrade.
2220000	2223000	Looks nice. At least they're upgrading it.
2223000	2226000	Take note, SNK.
2228000	2231000	Alright, so that's going to do it for release dates.
2231000	2236000	Well, there's actually some really cool news for people who are fans of Second Life.
2236000	2241000	Is that this upcoming...
2241000	2245000	Actually, I think that it's already passed given the date of...
2245000	2248000	Yeah, it was on June 1st at 7pm.
2248000	2252000	But BBC2 was broadcasting on Second Life.
2252000	2258000	They were doing The Money Program, which is a business show
2258000	2262000	that shows how big business affects everyday life.
2265000	2270000	Apparently, this looks like it might become a standard thing, I hope.
2270000	2272000	Did somebody throw cocks at them?
2273000	2281000	Well, for anyone in Second Life, the only place that you could go to watch it was the Red Run Red Cinema in Second Life.
2281000	2283000	I think it's kind of cool.
2283000	2286000	I totally have never played Second Life. This stuff is all foreign to me.
2286000	2289000	I tried once and thought it was crap, so I stopped playing.
2289000	2292000	All I ever could think about was Second Life with the flying penises.
2292000	2294000	I saw that one YouTube video.
2294000	2297000	I have real life. I have a first life.
2297000	2302000	It would be fun just to roam around Second Life and do stuff to annoy people.
2302000	2307000	Although the cool thing is that someone actually built the inside of the TARDIS
2307000	2310000	and built Daleks and all that. I thought it was cool.
2310000	2312000	Nerds, all of you.
2312000	2320000	I would want to make a giant stickman that's 500 stories tall that stomps around and smashes everything.
2320000	2323000	I know. Can we have monsters in Second Life? Can I make Godzilla?
2323000	2328000	Well, people made weapons of mass destruction and blown stuff up, so...
2328000	2329000	That's lovely.
2329000	2331000	So why not?
2331000	2337000	Giant Mario. Have him get the starter thing, turn in the pixelated Mario. Smash, smash, smash.
2337000	2339000	People will find humor in that, I would think.
2339000	2342000	I saw a really funny picture speaking of Mario Smash.
2342000	2347000	It was someone's signature on our forums, on the Dark Sakura forums,
2347000	2351000	because that's where our World of Warcraft guild has their forums headquartered.
2351000	2352000	Willplay.darksacra.com
2352000	2353000	There you have it.
2353000	2356000	Somebody made this little graphic or found it somewhere.
2356000	2361000	You remember in Super Mario Bros. 3, Mario could get the Hammer Brothers costume?
2361000	2364000	You see him throw a hammer into this hole. It goes boop.
2364000	2366000	Then you see the hammer fly in the hole.
2366000	2370000	It zooms out and it's the Death Star.
2370000	2372000	And it just flips upside down and says a million points.
2372000	2375000	And it falls down like the monsters used to do.
2375000	2377000	They just would flip upside down.
2377000	2381000	I'll have to find that picture and link it in chat while we do our next story.
2381000	2386000	Anyways, if you want some other awesome news,
2386000	2390000	you may want to try this brand new beta that's come out for a new MMO.
2390000	2396000	It's going to be a game called Fury, and it's a third-person slasher game, I guess.
2396000	2400000	Or a third-person combat game that you're going to be running around
2400000	2403000	as knights or whatever and killing each other.
2403000	2405000	So who wouldn't like that?
2405000	2408000	But they're having a beta for it right now,
2408000	2414000	so if you're very interested in this, check out the Fury beta sign-up page
2414000	2419000	at www.unleashthefury.com
2419000	2421000	and slash beta.
2421000	2423000	And you can check out that.
2423000	2424000	Looks pretty neat.
2424000	2426000	There's some other game out there.
2426000	2429000	I can't remember the name of it, but it was a Korean MMO
2429000	2432000	that compared it to The Matrix.
2432000	2437000	A lot of running on walls in gunfights and stuff like that.
2437000	2439000	But this looks kind of neat.
2439000	2441000	Love the title.
2441000	2443000	That's so great.
2443000	2444000	Oh, you saw the picture?
2444000	2446000	I was just watching it because Junami linked it.
2446000	2449000	Yeah, I didn't even see a Junami beat me to it.
2449000	2450000	You bastard!
2450000	2451000	Good job, though.
2451000	2452000	Chat room.
2452000	2454000	Meanwhile, I'm looking it up.
2454000	2457000	But I got distracted by a post because somebody was spamming the forums,
2457000	2460000	again, advertising Viagra, and I was really curious.
2460000	2461000	No, I'm kidding.
2461000	2464000	Nobody reads those posts on any forum.
2464000	2466000	I don't understand.
2466000	2470000	You're just now seeing the low-key Tingle graphic?
2470000	2473000	One of our listeners did that last week and put it on my All Games blog.
2473000	2474000	Anyway, sorry.
2474000	2476000	This is not good radio.
2476000	2477000	Fail.
2477000	2482000	What is good, though, is a Gods and Heroes Rome Rising beta.
2482000	2485000	The beta test sign-ups are going on right now.
2485000	2487000	Perpetual Entertainment opened up the sign-ups.
2487000	2490000	It's going to be a closed beta, though, so you have to be lucky and get picked.
2490000	2495000	But it's for Gods and Heroes Rome Rising.
2495000	2500000	The sign-up started, it looks like, on May 31st, and I don't see a closed date.
2500000	2503000	Of course, this is going to be an MMO from Perpetual Entertainment,
2503000	2507000	and you get to be the son or daughter of an Olympus god.
2507000	2512000	So you get to conquer enemies of Rome, you get to battle the iconic enemies
2512000	2517000	such as the Cyclops, Minotaur, Hydra, so on, Medusa, etc.
2517000	2518000	So check that out.
2518000	2522000	If you're into MMOs and you like Greek mythology, it would be a good time.
2522000	2525000	The graphics from the game look very pretty.
2525000	2528000	Sometimes screenshots don't show you that the game is very fluid,
2528000	2532000	so I'm hoping it runs as good as it looks.
2532000	2535000	It might be fun.
2535000	2539000	What's also fun is DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down
2539000	2541000	and left and right every week
2541000	2544000	and find her favorite website to share with you guys.
2544000	2546000	We're going to share that with you guys right now.
2546000	2548000	It's the Website of the Week.
2555000	2561000	Today's Website of the Week actually is brought to me by my amazing sauce
2561000	2565000	who is wonderful and full of internet nerdness and greatness.
2565000	2570000	It's lolbots.com, and this basically takes Caturday
2570000	2574000	and just macros every freaking nerdy thing ever in existence.
2574000	2577000	I'll have you know that my wife looked at this and she didn't get it,
2577000	2581000	as did I. I didn't get it.
2581000	2583000	I LOLed a couple times.
2583000	2585000	You do not have the geek vibe in you, obviously.
2585000	2588000	I do. I understand why it's supposed to be funny.
2588000	2591000	I just don't care anymore.
2591000	2593000	It's just like, it's old.
2593000	2596000	Give it up. Okay, yeah, we get it. Okay.
2596000	2599000	There's been games that have been translated literally from their Japanese stuff,
2599000	2601000	and it was funny because it was English.
2601000	2603000	Ooh, funny! Ha ha!
2603000	2607000	You know, get over it! That was years ago! Come on!
2607000	2611000	You know, literacy is not a jokey matter.
2611000	2617000	I don't even know where the hell to go after that.
2617000	2621000	Prozac. You should get some.
2621000	2624000	Valium, maybe.
2624000	2628000	lolbots.com. Valium.com for Loki.
2628000	2631000	Maybe you need to be reading some of those forum posts
2631000	2637000	that advertise the, you know, anti-depressants from the interwebs.
2637000	2641000	Remember, if you have trouble keeping it up, read the Viagra spam.
2641000	2648000	Well, doing our weekly part in promoting GameTap, or not...
2648000	2651000	Swear to God we're not on their payroll, I swear!
2651000	2655000	Yeah, we are. We're not getting paid.
2655000	2658000	They fixed the glitch in accounting.
2658000	2664000	Anyways, they're doing, on top of their normal subscription service,
2664000	2668000	they're doing a free kind of ad-supported service that's coming out.
2668000	2672000	They're going to be rotating 30 games every so often.
2672000	2675000	And starting off, you're going to get to play for free
2675000	2681000	Panzer Dragon, Metal Slug 2, Art of Fighting, The King of Fighters 95,
2681000	2685000	and the upcoming Tomb Raider Legend.
2685000	2689000	You know, kind of tying in with the whole Tomb Raider Anniversary stuff.
2689000	2693000	Also, they were saying that there's Bust to Move, Bubble Bobble, and Rampage
2693000	2695000	and all sorts of stuff like that.
2695000	2697000	So, that's kind of neat.
2697000	2702000	I mean, free games. Who can knock that?
2702000	2705000	But they're ad-supported, so they're not totally free.
2705000	2706000	You're paying for them with your soul.
2706000	2707000	Hey, I get free games.
2707000	2710000	Hey, well it beats fucking playing like, you know, an EA game,
2710000	2714000	say like Need for Speed or something, having advertisements in the background.
2714000	2716000	I already bought that game. Where's my money?
2716000	2718000	Well, you know what?
2718000	2724000	All these games are old, and a lot of people probably already have them.
2724000	2727000	I mean, it is the internet. There are ways to get stuff free.
2727000	2730000	Did GameTap open that up for those folks that are playing those?
2730000	2732000	Can they still play them online?
2732000	2736000	Do they have access to the head-to-head service on there?
2736000	2739000	Yeah. I think some of them will have online co-op.
2739000	2741000	That's kind of cool.
2741000	2745000	So maybe now I can play with some of the cheapskates and won't pay for GameTap.
2745000	2746000	I can play some games with them online.
2746000	2750000	Rob, I will pay so we can play real Metal Slug.
2750000	2753000	Or you could just come to my house.
2753000	2755000	Or you could just wait until, I don't know,
2755000	2759000	Metal Slug eventually comes to Xbox Live Arcade because, you know,
2759000	2764000	SNK loves re-releasing that damn game.
2764000	2768000	Ravenstahl often confirms it does have online multiplayer. Interesting.
2768000	2771000	All right. Well, there you have it.
2771000	2773000	Also, I wanted to mention briefly,
2773000	2778000	I saw in some interview somewhere that GameTap is still being worked on for the Mac.
2778000	2780000	And it could be coming out very soon.
2780000	2781000	I don't know if they had a date on that.
2781000	2783000	Which makes Loki very happy.
2783000	2785000	But no, I'll make many Mac fans out there very happy.
2785000	2786000	I think that would be very cool.
2786000	2789000	I was going to say, why would it make me happy? I don't own a Mac.
2789000	2791000	It's a joke. That's what we call in the industry a joke.
2791000	2794000	Oh, because the Mac will have the ability to play old-ass games?
2794000	2798000	Well, I'm curious if the PC games are going to play on the Mac.
2798000	2801000	That's kind of interesting, these games that were developed for the PC.
2801000	2803000	I don't see why they wouldn't.
2803000	2805000	Yeah, it's just interesting to me.
2805000	2808000	It's kind of like when you see Sega making games for a Nintendo system.
2808000	2810000	It's still kind of weird.
2810000	2811000	Same thing.
2811000	2814000	The first Sega games that I played, Rob, were on the ColecoVision.
2814000	2816000	I love the ColecoVision.
2816000	2820000	I'm so sad that I sold my ColecoVision to get a Super Nintendo.
2820000	2821000	I have another one if you want one.
2821000	2823000	I had 70 games at one time.
2823000	2826000	I used to go to flea markets and buy that shit for a buck each.
2826000	2828000	If I can find my second one, would you like it?
2828000	2833000	No, because that time is long past.
2833000	2838000	I was thinking about hooking up the Atari 5200 the other day, just for kicks.
2838000	2839000	All right.
2839000	2844000	Well, just for kicks, gold farmers like to annoy the shit out of me in World of Warcraft.
2844000	2847000	Seriously, I know not all our listeners play World of Warcraft,
2847000	2852000	but if you've been playing in the past month, huge problems with spammers on there.
2852000	2856000	Gold farmers just going crazy in the game, sending tells.
2856000	2860000	Well, the cool thing is that with the latest patch, Blizzard really put the smackdown on it.
2860000	2865000	What they did is that now you can just right-click on a name and report them for spam automatically.
2865000	2870000	If you have a trial account, you can't send a tell to somebody unless they're on your friends list
2870000	2872000	or they sent you a tell first.
2872000	2875000	Because that's what was happening is that they were getting all these trial accounts,
2875000	2878000	the gold spammers, and just spamming the hell out of everybody.
2878000	2882000	Blizzard did put the smackdown on them and got pretty pissed.
2882000	2886000	In fact, they went a step further and said this.
2886000	2890000	Blizzard has filed a federal lawsuit against the operators of Peons for Hire,
2890000	2894000	which is a popular gold-selling organization which many of you have no doubt seen advertised
2894000	2897000	because they were the ones that were really spamming in the game.
2897000	2902000	As part of the lawsuit, the operators of Peons for Hire have been asked to immediately cease all in-game spamming efforts
2902000	2905000	by all entities and websites under their control.
2905000	2908000	So Blizzard is now putting the smackdown in court.
2908000	2915000	By the way, it hasn't stopped because now what they do, they'll send you party invites and then send you the spam.
2915000	2918000	So I automatically decline party invites. I'm not expecting.
2918000	2921000	Why do you think I don't party with anybody but who I know?
2921000	2922000	Well, yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying.
2922000	2928000	But it's annoying because when you get a party invite, it goes boom and the little thing pops up on the screen.
2928000	2937000	Like the TGFRCVHGI has invited you to a party, which is just some spammer who hit their keyboard.
2937000	2941000	It's just annoying because you're trying to kill somebody and then boom.
2941000	2946000	Yes, and Blizzard has partnered up with Capcom to get Phoenix Wright on the case.
2946000	2947000	He'll get those spammers.
2947000	2949000	I hope so. He'll get them.
2949000	2953000	Phoenix Wright 5 versus the gold spammers.
2953000	2954000	All right.
2954000	2955000	You can see it now.
2955000	2964000	Anyway, well, if anybody is interested, because you know Activision is just, well, we hear things now and again.
2964000	2973000	But according to their financial report, they're stating that enemy territory quake wars will be out by the end of summer.
2973000	2979000	It actually was on paper to be due during the second quarter of the fiscal 2008.
2979000	2983000	So I don't know.
2983000	2989000	However, all they're saying is that it's still just going to be done when it's done.
2989000	2993000	Hmm. Let me consult my magic eight ball here.
2993000	2996000	Hmm. Signs point to end of August.
2996000	2999000	That's what everybody else is saying.
2999000	3001000	Oh, your magic eight ball, huh?
3001000	3003000	Invisible eight ball.
3003000	3009000	The eight ball we don't speak about ever, especially when Namco's in the room.
3009000	3011000	La la la.
3011000	3012000	It's eight ball, not a katamari.
3012000	3013000	Oh, I see.
3013000	3014000	Rob.
3014000	3015000	What?
3015000	3016000	Rob.
3016000	3017000	What?
3017000	3018000	Rob.
3018000	3019000	What?
3019000	3020000	Tell us some other stuff.
3020000	3022000	Well, excuse me.
3022000	3023000	Dark Sakura.
3023000	3025000	Oh, my God, you didn't do it right.
3025000	3026000	Okay.
3026000	3029000	I don't want Rob to say anything else.
3029000	3031000	Rob's not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.
3031000	3033000	Thank you, Rob D. I heart you.
3033000	3035000	Rob is not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.
3035000	3041000	Loki, you're taking over as our mediator here.
3041000	3042000	Lord help us.
3042000	3048000	Whoa.
3048000	3049000	I'm going to throw something.
3049000	3051000	Where's the ferret?
3051000	3052000	Is that Kirby?
3052000	3053000	No, it's a Jigglypuff.
3053000	3054000	Let me see Jigglypuff.
3054000	3055000	I'll throw it at Rob.
3055000	3056000	I can't reach Jigglypuff.
3056000	3058000	The best part is he sent me two.
3058000	3060000	Well, excuse me again.
3060000	3067000	Dark Sakura.
3067000	3070000	I hit Rob in the shoulder with a Jigglypuff.
3070000	3073000	We have the best fucking listeners of any radio program on anywhere.
3073000	3074000	No, you don't.
3074000	3075000	You suck.
3075000	3077000	Go to hell.
3077000	3078000	Anyways.
3078000	3081000	So, surprise.
3081000	3083000	Final Fantasy XIII is hit.
3083000	3089000	Well, probably not the first, but one of the many delays, this being Final Fantasy XIII
3089000	3091000	Versus, has been put on hold.
3091000	3099000	According to an interview with Dengeki PlayStation of Japan, Final Fantasy main man Tetsuya Nomura
3099000	3103000	has revealed that he likes to only work on one project at a time.
3103000	3110000	And, obviously, right now, his focus is a mobile game called Monotone, and that means
3110000	3113000	that Final Fantasy XIII is on hold.
3113000	3117000	But, you know, not a big surprise, also, I mean, because it's not just a port of XIII,
3117000	3120000	it is an entirely new game itself.
3120000	3125000	So, yeah, you'll just have to deal with one Final Fantasy XIII game.
3125000	3132000	And, my God, release only one Final Fantasy game at a time.
3132000	3140000	Don't make XIII-1, XIII-2, XIII-B, XIII-I mean, you got a little happy with VII because
3140000	3146000	VII was so popular and it sold well, then you started doing this shit with XII.
3146000	3148000	Fucking money hungry bitches.
3148000	3151000	Just make one game only.
3151000	3154000	And then, if people like the game, they'll say, hey, I want more.
3154000	3161000	Instead of saying, hey, we have 13 games coming out for Final Fantasy XIII, collect them all.
3161000	3164000	Final Fantasy XIII.
3164000	3168000	Fabulous Kristin Novellas.
3168000	3170000	Kristin Novellas.
3170000	3175000	You know what that sounds like at one of those Telemundo shows or whatever?
3175000	3177000	Kristin Novellas.
3177000	3181000	Telemundo, Telemundo.
3181000	3190000	Tonight on Sabado Higante, Fabulous Kristin Novella.
3190000	3194000	Seems like none of this other news even matters anymore.
3194000	3201000	However, Electronic Arts out of Canada recently lifted the embargo going on for the upcoming
3201000	3210000	PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 racer, Need for Speed Pro Street.
3210000	3213000	It is a new game coming out a little later this year.
3213000	3217000	It's not quite the same underground street racing you're used to with the Need for Speed.
3217000	3219000	It's something a little bit new.
3219000	3224000	Now you're going to go to Raceways and show your muscle there.
3224000	3228000	Basically, you race in a little bit of a different way than you have in the underground ones before.
3228000	3230000	It's race wars.
3230000	3239000	Real cars, including the Mazda RX-7, the Aston Martin DB9, Audi S4, Dodge Challenger from 71.
3239000	3240000	Good times.
3240000	3243000	And, of course, some screenshots were released as well.
3243000	3247000	Some of the new modes in the game, Tandem Drift, Drag Grip, and Speed Challenge.
3247000	3250000	It's coming out in fall of 2007.
3250000	3253000	You can totally see in one of these screenshots here a drag race kind of mode.
3253000	3254000	Pretty cool.
3254000	3255000	You know what I really would love to see EA make?
3255000	3256000	What's that?
3256000	3259000	A Cannonball Run game.
3259000	3260000	They've got the graphics.
3260000	3262000	They've got the engine.
3262000	3265000	Let's get Burt Reynolds on this thing.
3265000	3268000	Good times.
3268000	3271000	So, we're going to get into the mailbag, but...
3271000	3272000	What?
3272000	3273000	I have to play this.
3273000	3275000	No!
3275000	3276000	Give me Julie Puff again.
3276000	3277000	No, no, no.
3277000	3281000	It's nothing to do with you, DarkSakura, but it's something else that was brought up earlier in the show.
3281000	3286000	Ready?
3286000	3287000	That's right.
3287000	3293000	It's the soundtrack to Miss World, Nude 96.
3293000	3295000	Come on.
3295000	3298000	All right.
3298000	3303000	Keep it up.
3303000	3305000	This makes for great radio, doesn't it?
3305000	3314000	But this is the soundtrack I'm going to look forward to.
3314000	3317000	Dude, this is great.
3317000	3319000	I remember.
3319000	3331000	It just looped that same thing over and over again.
3331000	3335000	Now I'm ready for the mailbag.
3335000	3338000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3338000	3339000	DarkSakura reads them.
3339000	3346000	Here she goes.
3346000	3347000	Hey, Rob.
3347000	3348000	Yes?
3348000	3350000	Die in a plague.
3350000	3354000	Well, excuse me, DarkSakura.
3354000	3358000	Whatever.
3358000	3361000	Turn off the damn music.
3361000	3362000	Oh, my God.
3362000	3364000	You're trying to...
3364000	3371000	You know, I was just over my PMS and you made it worse.
3371000	3372000	I single-handedly brought it back.
3372000	3374000	All right, read an email.
3374000	3378000	We got one from VoteForDan, I guess.
3378000	3379000	I'm not voting for him.
3379000	3381000	Oh, Dr. Burst, I'm sorry.
3381000	3386000	Do you think WoW will come to the Xbox 360?
3386000	3388000	Did I answer this one already?
3388000	3390000	Yeah, didn't we do that one last week?
3390000	3392000	Sorry, I already answered this last week.
3392000	3393000	Download the old podcast.
3393000	3394000	I don't think it will anyways.
3394000	3396000	Next email.
3396000	3397000	Hi, everyone at OLR.
3397000	3403000	I just wanted to write a quick email to let you know that I listen to your podcasts every time a new one comes out
3403000	3405000	and I have access to download it to my MP3 player.
3405000	3408000	I listen to all your podcasts multiple times while I'm working.
3408000	3411000	Each opinion from the OLR staff is extremely appreciated.
3411000	3415000	I am a member on GameTrailers.com with the username NarutoCastle.
3415000	3420000	I will be giving OLR a plug on my blog when I get a spare moment to write one on there.
3420000	3422000	We'll let you know when it's up.
3422000	3424000	I've been playing Final Fantasy III and enjoying it a lot.
3424000	3429000	Cannot wait for Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V to come out on Nintendo DS.
3429000	3430000	Well, thanks for reading my email.
3430000	3434000	Take care, Gregory in Australia.
3434000	3438000	Thank you for the plug in your blog because that's like word-of-mouth advertising, which is so essential for us.
3438000	3443000	Well, speaking of which, he also writes back and says,
3443000	3447000	Hi guys, Greg here again updating on my blog that lets GameTrailer members know about OLR.
3447000	3449000	Feel free to take a look at the blog.
3449000	3453000	Go to GameTrailers.com and search for user NarutoCastle and you'll see blogs.
3453000	3456000	The most recent should be the OLR blog.
3456000	3461000	I was doing my best to spread the word to as many people as I can who either listen to podcasts or into video games.
3461000	3464000	Thank you so much for a great podcast and keep up the great work.
3464000	3466000	Aw, thank you.
3466000	3470000	Wasn't there a question there amongst all the lovey-dovey stuff?
3470000	3472000	I don't know.
3472000	3475000	Oh, I thought there was a question at the beginning of his first email.
3475000	3480000	Well, we have another one from Xenoore, I guess how it's spelled, X-E-N-O-O-R-E.
3480000	3482000	Hey guys, love the show.
3482000	3484000	I've been listening for a few episodes here and there.
3484000	3487000	Your group dynamic always brings smiles to my cheeks.
3487000	3491000	It reminds me of my squad of geek gamers from times long past.
3491000	3493000	Keep up the awesome work.
3493000	3499000	Recently, during some banter amongst the group, you commented on the combat system of Final Fantasy XII.
3499000	3501000	Your discussion intrigued me enough to give the game a shot.
3501000	3505000	Hubsqueenix sends you a big check for your promotion skills.
3505000	3508000	Best to look to you guys in the future as Xenoore.
3508000	3512000	I haven't heard that expression before, bring a smile to my cheeks.
3512000	3515000	I just hope you're not talking about your ass cheeks, because that's not a compliment.
3515000	3517000	You can't smile on your ass, dammit.
3517000	3518000	What the hell is wrong with you?
3518000	3519000	It's sideways.
3519000	3522000	Forget it.
3522000	3523000	Well, we have another-
3523000	3524000	That doesn't make any sense.
3524000	3526000	It totally doesn't.
3526000	3528000	Most of my jokes don't.
3528000	3536000	I'm going to actually download the image so that I can put it on my PhotoCrapIt account and show everybody in the chat room.
3536000	3541000	But we got one from RobWithTwoBees.
3541000	3547000	This attaches a couple hours of work on how to decorate my first Forza 2 car.
3547000	3553000	It's mostly based on the pixel motif of the homepage, and he did an OL Army Audi.
3553000	3554000	Can we see the picture in studio again?
3554000	3556000	It's very pretty.
3556000	3558000	That's an awesome car.
3558000	3559000	I'm very impressed.
3559000	3563000	Rob Way gets 50 points for Gryffindor.
3563000	3564000	I don't know.
3564000	3568000	What can we give the listeners to do cool stuff like this?
3568000	3569000	I don't know.
3569000	3570000	Mad props, I suppose.
3570000	3571000	But that's not-
3571000	3572000	A dollar.
3572000	3574000	The cars that people have been-
3574000	3575000	That's right.
3575000	3576000	Rob, if you send us-
3576000	3577000	Okay, here you go.
3577000	3578000	Yes, we will do that.
3578000	3580000	Rob, if you will send us your PayPal, assuming-
3580000	3582000	I don't know if it's your regular email, if you have a silver email.
3582000	3586000	I'll PayPal you $1, courtesy of Orange Launch Radio for your awesomeness for this car.
3586000	3589000	You should frame it, too.
3589000	3594000	Also coming from Rob's favorite person, SakuraMaxx.
3594000	3595000	Oh, yeah, this guy.
3595000	3596000	How old is he?
3596000	3597000	Eleven?
3597000	3598000	Twelve.
3598000	3599000	Oh, big difference.
3599000	3600000	Quick email to say happy birthday.
3600000	3601000	Jamie rules.
3601000	3602000	Loki is cool.
3602000	3603000	Sky sucks.
3603000	3605000	It had lots of dots after it.
3605000	3608000	But the Bimani music is cool.
3608000	3612000	I'm so sad because some 12-year-old on the internet hates me.
3612000	3614000	Boo hoo, what am I going to do?
3614000	3615000	I think it's kind of funny.
3615000	3617000	I asked for dark Sakura hate mail, not Sky hate mail.
3617000	3618000	Why don't you people listening-
3618000	3622000	Signed, SakuraMaxx, 12-year-old listener, one with the best email closings once a pet
3622000	3623000	grew and loves Pokey.
3623000	3624000	Why do you even read his emails?
3624000	3625000	They bring nothing to the show.
3625000	3626000	Because they're funny.
3626000	3627000	They bring nothing to the show.
3627000	3628000	Why is it so awful?
3628000	3629000	They're funny.
3629000	3632000	I'm supposed to get this game later this week, Forza 2, by the way.
3632000	3634000	I have no interest in Forza 2 whatsoever.
3634000	3635000	I don't either, but-
3635000	3636000	Hey, last email.
3636000	3638000	Microsoft hooks me up sometimes.
3638000	3640000	Hey, OLR crew, it's GS68.
3640000	3645000	I enjoyed the OLR panel at Fanime and I'm looking forward to seeing it again next year.
3645000	3647000	How is Fanime anyhow?
3647000	3649000	Any good stories to share?
3649000	3651000	That was from GS68.
3651000	3656000	Yeah, there was me deciding that my costume wasn't going to work and going in the dealer's
3656000	3662000	room and dropping $120 to buy the stuff for my Iruka costume and I ended up doing chick
3662000	3663000	style.
3663000	3664000	Can I have a loan?
3664000	3665000	Shit.
3665000	3666000	I don't know.
3666000	3667000	I bought a-
3667000	3668000	I got yelled at by my husband.
3668000	3669000	It was great.
3669000	3670000	Over breakfast.
3670000	3671000	I'm sorry.
3671000	3676000	I bought a bit generation game called Colorist and I have no idea how to play it.
3676000	3678000	You got a porn star's autograph too, didn't you?
3678000	3681000	I got a porn star's autograph for my wife and she loved that.
3681000	3684000	I also got two Harry Potter pictures for my wife.
3684000	3686000	She liked that as well.
3686000	3690000	There's one other thing I thought I got her as well.
3690000	3692000	I can't remember.
3692000	3693000	I bought one shirt.
3693000	3695000	That's the only thing I bought.
3695000	3699000	I got him the Goomba that makes noise.
3699000	3700000	Oh, that thing was cool.
3700000	3702000	The thing you hit and it goes oink oink oink.
3702000	3706000	And then you hit it one more time and it does the You're Dead music.
3706000	3710000	I went back looking for the coin box and they didn't have it.
3710000	3715000	You keep hitting the coin box and every tenth one it gives you a one up.
3715000	3719000	This isn't intended as a plug but you can order them from Wizzy Wig.
3719000	3720000	Oh, alright.
3720000	3722000	That's where I got my Goomba from.
3722000	3728000	I also got a shirt that said Grand Theft Amish, Penn State Dutch.
3728000	3731000	Yeah, from the same booth that he got that shirt, I got one.
3731000	3734000	I actually posted a picture of the shirt in my All Games blog.
3734000	3738000	If you want to see that, it's community.allgames.com.
3738000	3740000	How the hell do you get there?
3740000	3741000	Green Sky is my username on there.
3741000	3744000	Just find me on there.
3744000	3746000	I posted a picture of the shirt I got.
3746000	3750000	It says, this is Zelda.
3750000	3752000	Basically, they took a picture of the guy from 300.
3752000	3754000	They took a picture of his face and put the Zelda hat on him.
3754000	3756000	It's really funny if you see it.
3756000	3758000	That's great. I've seen that one, yeah.
3758000	3761000	I didn't even see 300 and I get the joke so I thought it was great.
3761000	3764000	How was that? That was the shirt I got.
3764000	3766000	Oh, I didn't mention during my gaming week, though,
3766000	3769000	since he asked about how was the rest of Fonimate.
3769000	3772000	Because I got there right before our panel started,
3772000	3773000	I didn't get to spend much time there.
3773000	3775000	But I went to the game room afterwards.
3775000	3776000	I went the day after.
3776000	3778000	And I played some Papa music on a Melo 2.
3778000	3780000	And I got the high score on the machine.
3780000	3781000	I forgot how to get high speed.
3781000	3785000	And my dumbass picked the Galaxy Express 3.9 TV theme.
3785000	3786000	Which is fucking slow.
3786000	3788000	I don't think you can put high speed on that one.
3788000	3789000	At least I don't know how.
3789000	3791000	I couldn't figure it out either.
3791000	3795000	Because I was like, dude, I can play Papa music better than this.
3795000	3799000	I did, however, play a crap ton of Dance Maniacs.
3799000	3802000	And we had Para Para Shadowing going on.
3802000	3803000	Oh my god, nerds.
3803000	3805000	With people who could do it. It was good.
3805000	3806000	Wow.
3806000	3808000	All right, so there you go.
3808000	3809000	Yeah, we'll be back.
3809000	3810000	If they'll have us, we'll be back next year.
3810000	3813000	And the best part was hanging out with DJ Ronma S.
3813000	3817000	The best part was the mini-disc player recorded the show this time.
3817000	3818000	That's right.
3818000	3819000	Sort of.
3819000	3820000	The show didn't come out too bad.
3820000	3822000	It did weird shit, and I don't know why.
3822000	3827000	Probably has something to do with the fact that the battery is slowly eating itself away.
3827000	3832000	Oh, and the other great part, we found out that Loki's Mac Heckler lives in town.
3832000	3834000	So we're going to have him on a future show.
3834000	3836000	I found something cool, too.
3836000	3840000	And I'm going to, actually, next week's side of the week is probably going to be a plug for this guy's site.
3840000	3843000	I hung out a lot in Artist Alley.
3843000	3846000	Because me being an artist and having a bunch of my friends in there,
3846000	3850000	I had to go and hang out with the artsy fartsy people.
3850000	3856000	And it turned out that I got more photos taken of me wearing my Tron shirt with my Dolphie than in costume.
3856000	3858000	Which was sort of sad.
3858000	3864000	But I also bought this great print of Iron Man for Sauce.
3864000	3869000	And this guy drew me Deadpool, and he said that he'd do a full-color print for me.
3869000	3873000	And he actually lives in the Sacramento area.
3873000	3874000	So I'm going to plug his site next week.
3874000	3876000	Oh, I know which guy you're talking about.
3876000	3879000	The guy that does all the comic stuff and he's at every single anime convention.
3879000	3881000	I think he's even at the Sacramento one sometime.
3881000	3883000	I think he was supposed to be here, yeah.
3883000	3889000	I was going to give him a call about the commission for the picture because he did a really freaking good job.
3889000	3893000	There's a SAC anime convention coming up this weekend.
3893000	3894000	I can't go because I'm in New York.
3894000	3895000	It's not this weekend, is it?
3895000	3896000	Yeah, I think it's coming up this next weekend.
3896000	3897000	Well, next weekend, yeah.
3897000	3899000	Well, I'll go to the mall anyways.
3899000	3902000	No, I think it's the one at the temple.
3902000	3903000	Anyway, forget it.
3903000	3905000	We'll talk about it offline.
3905000	3910000	But hey, if you run an anime convention, you want us to come do a live panel, we're open to suggestions.
3910000	3912000	Dude, sweet, the Rob D.
3912000	3916000	We're kind of broke and can't travel too much, but we're certainly open to hearing suggestions,
3916000	3922000	especially anything that goes on in Northern California or Southern California or Northern Nevada, someplace we can drive to.
3922000	3926000	No, to the Rob D, they said that they did an anime hell at Asen.
3926000	3934000	I didn't know that they put the full Sega Tashanshiro video in that, which is like, anyone who's a Sega fan has to have seen that.
3934000	3935000	Hmm.
3935000	3940000	It's like the epitome of the Sega Saturn advertising era.
3940000	3943000	All right, we're going to get back into some news though.
3943000	3945000	Enough talk about conventions.
3945000	3948000	Where shall we go for another story?
3948000	3949000	Let's go to me.
3949000	3951000	Let's talk about the PSP.
3951000	3956000	Sony releases its uncrackable firmware 3.5.
3956000	3963000	It adds a bunch of new features, including remote play, so you have the ability to play anything that's on your PS3,
3963000	3968000	well, movies and whatnot over the internet on your PSP.
3968000	3979000	Also, let's see here, yeah, also it enhances some of the RSS feeds and stuff like that.
3979000	3980000	Interesting.
3980000	3990000	One other feature that they forgot to mention, it is actually very crackable and got cracked almost, actually I think a day before it came out, if that's possible.
3990000	4003000	But yeah, so now they're working on a new custom firmware for 3.5 and it was kind of funny because they actually used the tools from 3.3 to crack it and apparently it wasn't that hard.
4003000	4006000	So, way to go Sony.
4006000	4009000	Was that their unhackable firmware?
4009000	4011000	Yeah, their unhackable firmware.
4011000	4014000	Each firmware is unhackable, you understand.
4014000	4015000	Well, of course.
4015000	4016000	Of course.
4016000	4018000	Can't do it, just can't.
4018000	4020000	It's impossible.
4020000	4021000	Sad.
4021000	4025000	Oh, speaking of unhacking PSPs, it was very interesting.
4025000	4029000	I fixed, I've been taking apart PSPs to fix them.
4029000	4035000	My friend's analog stick was broken and I actually took apart the entire analog stick and fixed it.
4035000	4042000	Which is amazing because anybody knows me, normally when I take stuff apart it works less than when I first took it apart.
4042000	4046000	So, yeah, I'm not very good at that.
4046000	4048000	But PSP, it's magic.
4048000	4049000	Well, speaking of hacking...
4049000	4050000	Is it your mutant power?
4050000	4053000	I guess it is my mutant power to be able to fix PSPs.
4053000	4063000	Speaking of hacking things and changing them and making them your own of sorts, this was a very interesting statement made by Activision in a conference call they had with investors this week.
4063000	4065000	This is something else.
4065000	4073000	Now, keep in mind, Activision acquired the Guitar Hero franchise when they bought out Red Octane, essentially, or their acquisition of Red Octane, whatever you want to call it.
4073000	4075000	They got the Guitar Hero franchise.
4075000	4081000	What's interesting is they have now said about Rock Band, which is coming out,
4081000	4086000	It wasn't surprising that Guitar Hero has attracted imitators.
4086000	4097000	Okay, so basically you're saying Rock Band is an imitation of Guitar Hero, except you may remember Harmonix originally made Guitar Hero for Red Octane before you bought it.
4097000	4100000	So that comment made no sense at all.
4100000	4108000	And when you consider Guitar Freaks came first anyway, by Konami, you all suck.
4108000	4112000	Just make your games, make them good, and SDF you?
4112000	4117000	And technically they're all rip-off of Amplitude anyways, Amplitude and Frequency.
4117000	4124000	Well, the interface of Guitar Hero, that and Karaoke Revolution, too, a little bit.
4124000	4131000	Yeah, they really pay that guy the big bucks, apparently. He's real on top of everything.
4131000	4135000	Have you seen the gameplay footage of Guitar Hero 3 that's on the internet right now?
4135000	4138000	It looks pretty sexy, but it doesn't look that different.
4138000	4143000	Yeah, I think this is the game that'll finally jump the shark for everybody else.
4143000	4151000	I think the series jumped the shark already for me with this 80's edition thing, but I think Guitar Hero 3 people are finally going to go, okay, enough.
4151000	4157000	But I think that's good that Harmonix, instead of trying to do the same thing over again, is trying to...
4157000	4161000	I give them a lot of credit. They're a pretty badass company in many ways.
4161000	4167000	And I think the fact that they are trying to evolve with the marketplace, with this whole rock band thing, it's a huge risk.
4167000	4169000	But then again, so is Guitar Hero.
4169000	4174000	I'm sorry, but I think Activision is going to get left behind with the Guitar Hero franchise.
4174000	4181000	It's going to be kind of like Guitar Freaks was. Look at Guitar Freaks.
4181000	4185000	How many versions of that game have come out and really they haven't innovated on each other?
4185000	4188000	Yet for some reason they're still doing well in Japan, so that's kind of funky.
4188000	4191000	So you can either have one or two things.
4191000	4195000	Either it's going to still do very well, or it's just going to tank.
4195000	4204000	I think people are going to start figuring out, hey, maybe spending all this money on this guitar game each time around is not a good idea.
4204000	4211000	It's kind of like why DDR is starting to dip down a little bit in popularity, especially when it's coming out on all these new platforms.
4211000	4213000	Buy all new hardware for this shit.
4213000	4218000	Actually, we haven't heard a lot about what's going on in the DDR world in a while.
4218000	4222000	I guess maybe by the time E3 or whatever the hell it is.
4222000	4229000	Honestly though, come on. Think of all the things that we probably would have expected with the 360 version.
4229000	4233000	Really, the 360 version is just a prettied up version of the Xbox One.
4233000	4244000	And the one for the Nintendo Wii when it comes out is pretty much just a PlayStation 2 version of Supernova with Wiimote crap thrown on there.
4244000	4248000	I was going to say, I guess we have Wii DDR. That's kind of something we know so far.
4248000	4252000	Very, I don't know, very non-innovative.
4252000	4261000	Granted, yeah, great you're doing stuff with the Wiimote, but I don't think you really need to do stuff with the Wiimote.
4261000	4263000	It's just like the iToy.
4263000	4266000	Yeah, the iToy support was there. It was ridiculous.
4266000	4271000	Not even remotely fun. It made you look like a complete ass.
4271000	4273000	I don't know.
4273000	4281000	Anyway, sorry, we've definitely beat this story into the ground, but just a dumb comment made by that guy at Activision.
4281000	4283000	Just a dumb comment.
4283000	4288000	When have we heard much smart from that guy at Activision? I swear, doesn't he hang out with Kudaragi?
4288000	4291000	Don't know. Maybe they all have a secret bar they drink at all day.
4291000	4293000	You mean crayon juice?
4293000	4305000	Anyway, something that's pretty cool, at least if you're into it, is that SNK Playmore is to be releasing...
4305000	4306000	A new game?
4306000	4309000	Sort of.
4309000	4315000	They're doing Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1, which is Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury 2, Fatal Fury 3, and Fatal Fury Special.
4315000	4319000	Aw, so close!
4319000	4322000	But hey, we get old school my booty.
4322000	4326000	Are you going to be redoing any of the graphics whatsoever?
4326000	4327000	No.
4327000	4329000	Okay.
4329000	4331000	Would that be arcade quality?
4331000	4332000	Whoopee!
4332000	4334000	Didn't those games come out ten years ago?
4334000	4337000	Seriously, Fatal Fury Special came out in 1995.
4337000	4342000	To give them credit, their Art of Fighting collection was only $14.99 for the Playstation 2.
4342000	4351000	You know the one thing I liked about the Fatal Fury games that I thought was innovative for old 2D fighters was having the multiplane.
4351000	4355000	You couldn't really tell which plane they were on, but you had the front and back.
4355000	4358000	Oh, I love Fatal Fury, don't get me wrong.
4358000	4363000	It was my favorite, like, obviously Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat were kind of up on this path.
4363000	4365000	Actually, Street Fighter was up on a frickin' pedestal.
4365000	4370000	Mortal Kombat was close behind, and then you had all these other knockoff fighting games below, right?
4370000	4371000	In the 90s, right?
4371000	4374000	I would say Fatal Fury was my favorite of that bunch.
4374000	4376000	More so than anything else SNK put out.
4376000	4380000	Fatal Fury paved the way for King of Fighters, and that makes me happy.
4380000	4384000	No, here's what SNK needs to do.
4384000	4387000	I mean, great re-releasing games and stuff.
4387000	4390000	Just re-release Neo Geo collections.
4390000	4398000	Have Magical Lord, have the Fatal Fury games, Metal Slug, all this stuff together.
4398000	4405000	Instead of just, here's two games that you've bought before, here's Metal Slug yet again, here's this stuff.
4405000	4407000	Yeah, but who really bought that stuff?
4407000	4409000	Those cartridges were like $500.
4409000	4411000	Exactly. But still, though, they've re-
4411000	4414000	You are a crazy bitch. You're in your own category.
4414000	4417000	But still, though, they've re-released these games numerous times.
4417000	4419000	To be honest, a lot of them we got through trade.
4419000	4424000	The only one that we paid over $300 for was King of Fighters 2000.
4424000	4429000	Only? I see a $60 Xbox 360 game and I cry.
4429000	4433000	But yeah, but we have a lot more bills now, so we don't do that anymore.
4433000	4436000	Except I really want Samurai Shodown 5.
4436000	4438000	Really? It was the last Neo Geo-
4438000	4440000	You will play it once. You will play it once.
4440000	4441000	The fuck I will!
4441000	4444000	And then put it in a glass case and say, I own it, and you don't.
4444000	4449000	The fuck I will? No. Are we rated M today? Yeah.
4449000	4450000	Kinda.
4450000	4451000	Rated M?
4451000	4452000	Yeah, we're rated M.
4452000	4455000	Yeah, ooh, watch out, that ESRB's on our ass.
4455000	4456000	We're rated I for-
4456000	4460000	Wait, we're not a game, dumbass. You can't play through us.
4460000	4464000	We're rated I for immature. Thanks to Loki.
4464000	4467000	Something's telling me we need a little bit of a break.
4467000	4468000	No.
4468000	4471000	I think now's a good time. We're gonna break you.
4471000	4472000	Break you back.
4472000	4473000	I will break you.
4473000	4475000	I will break you.
4475000	4481000	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.
4481000	4486000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
