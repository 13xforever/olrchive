1
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:19,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, June 24th, 2007, our introduction takes a little trip down memory lane.

2
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, where are we going?

3
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:35,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

4
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:25,747
[SPEAKER_04]: and now for our feature presentation Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content so you probably shouldn't let your children listen

5
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!

6
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:40,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

7
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:49,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

8
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:52,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

9
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,470
[SPEAKER_05]: He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

10
00:01:57,381 --> 00:02:00,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

11
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:01,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Sandburgers!

12
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,247
[SPEAKER_05]: The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

13
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That was huge.

14
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

15
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

16
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:13,616
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

17
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:15,537
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing you're gonna be riding is me.

18
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen my... Lena?

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

20
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:22,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was you.

21
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:25,883
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

22
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:51,849
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live on this June the 24th of 2007.

23
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Good God, that was a bloated ass intro.

24
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,351
[SPEAKER_06]: That was actually... That was one of our old intros.

25
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,212
[SPEAKER_06]: That intro was like two minutes long.

26
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:01,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

27
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually used that for like a year.

28
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:09,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, hi and welcome to that show dedicated not just to Bomani now, but after...

29
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:16,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Several years on the air, we evolved to talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.

30
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,129
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

31
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:21,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

32
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,172
Hi.

33
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Five years, and that's all you have to say is, ah.

34
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:28,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

35
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,016
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I'd sum it up, too, really.

36
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,762
[SPEAKER_06]: and also say hello as always to Tech Master Loki.

37
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:34,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

38
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:35,403
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Loki?

39
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:36,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.

40
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:37,264
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

41
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:37,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

42
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:39,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you have it.

43
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:42,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the three of us tonight because tonight is a special night.

44
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,728
[SPEAKER_06]: It is our fifth anniversary show.

45
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:52,754
[SPEAKER_06]: And hello to those of you in our chat room, the always present fourth guest in our program, chat.orangeloungerator.com, the biggest our chat room has ever been.

46
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:53,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much.

47
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:59,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And a big thank you to allgames.com as well, who's simulcasting our live broadcast tonight to a

48
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:00,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I played World of Warcraft.

49
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:01,038
[SPEAKER_06]: You were there.

50
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:03,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I signed off to go talk to people.

51
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,356
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:50,467
[SPEAKER_07]: and WTF for Work Time Fun, I guess, for the PSP.

53
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:51,528
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty awesome.

54
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:52,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little weird.

55
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,589
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the games are very mundane.

56
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:55,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like working.

57
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Like one of them that you put caps on pens.

58
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:00,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

59
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:06,716
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another one that's pretty funny, though, where you are a drunken mayor and you have to stumble your way over to a ribbon to cut it.

60
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So you basically earn money to...

61
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:13,806
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

62
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:36,188
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank God they leaked it on the internet, because I would not have wanted to buy this game.

63
00:05:36,528 --> 00:05:38,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It is horrible.

64
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:40,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It's short, for one.

65
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:44,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I beat the game under an hour, so that's pretty bad.

66
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:54,715
[SPEAKER_07]: The second thing is, the guy behind it, this French guy who does this podcast, I believe it's called, was it Street Smart Cool Cat?

67
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:56,816
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a fucking retard.

68
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate him.

69
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:00,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate him even more after playing this game.

70
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,740
[SPEAKER_07]: He is a complete douche.

71
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:12,024
[SPEAKER_07]: He is on, like, the beginning of each level that you play, he's doing something stupid to make himself look really cool, and he's not.

72
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:18,547
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like a cross between fucking Bill Nye the Science Guy and Screech, except not smart and nerdier.

73
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:23,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, I also played, let's see, Transformers, the game on the PSP.

74
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:26,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God I'm not buying the PSP one.

75
00:06:27,556 --> 00:06:29,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I will be playing the 360 one later this week.

76
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:33,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to see what the PSP one looked like, and it's not very good.

77
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:37,485
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you only have a PSP, then maybe it's worth picking up.

78
00:06:38,528 --> 00:07:01,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, I actually played some of the single player part of that so that was kind of interesting, pretty good storyline so far of course multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and let's see, off of the PSP, also played Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link still hate that game but I'm still playing it Earth Defense Force 2, I actually tried that on the PlayStation 2

79
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:05,294
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

80
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:06,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the controls too much.

81
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:12,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if there's a way to configure it so it's exactly like the Xbox 360, because I think that would really help.

82
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:19,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Because right now, the way they have it set up, your look and movement are the same analog sticks, so that kind of sucks.

83
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:20,558
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, it looks pretty cool.

84
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,579
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to destroy Big Ben in the first level.

85
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:25,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what else?

86
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:33,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I also played, of course, more Earth Defense Force 2017, finished the game on Hard now, and now we're going through Hardest and Inferno.

87
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:37,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about time you beat that damn game, because I swear, for like the past ten weeks of this program...

88
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:45,383
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

89
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,670
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

90
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:38,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Our guild is really growing on there, and it's been a lot of fun.

91
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:42,713
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Ventrilo and all that fun stuff, so it's a fun time waster.

92
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:45,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, not a whole lot.

93
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:49,781
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked out the new Xbox Live Arcade titled The Band of Bugs game.

94
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:50,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you check that out at all?

95
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

96
00:09:18,818 --> 00:09:19,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So much for that.

97
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:25,104
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I did also, I got on the GameTap for some strange reason.

98
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I decided, oh, I'm paying for this.

99
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I should probably check it out again.

100
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just started, I had like a marathon the other day.

101
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing all these old school Atari 2600 games.

102
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:34,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was playing Kaboom for like an hour and a half.

103
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:35,835
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of sad.

104
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:41,915
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that game, like, you remember on the old school 2600 with the little paddle, except now you use your mouse and you catch the bombs?

105
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know what it is.

106
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, some people can sit there and play Bejeweled for hours.

107
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing Kaboom.

108
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:49,001
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played Pitfall, the old school Pitfall.

109
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a lot better at it now than I was when I was seven.

110
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:51,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

111
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually played through quite a ways in the game.

112
00:09:55,171 --> 00:10:00,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like how GameTap is really taking a lot of good ideas from Xbox Live and incorporating into their service.

113
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:04,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Like now you have a profile page that shows the last games that you've played and all that.

114
00:10:05,073 --> 00:10:05,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Where have I seen this before?

115
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have your leaderboards on the actual service itself.

116
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:10,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So, pretty cool.

117
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,776
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, hey, if it's a good idea, why not borrow it?

118
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:17,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say rip it off, but I guess it would be borrow it.

119
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:17,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

120
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:26,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like how GameTap's growing and it'll be interesting when it comes over to the Macs and more people that I know have been holding out on GameTap because it's not out on Mac will be able to come over.

121
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,739
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that was really it.

122
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, a little bit of Puzzle Quest and that was pretty much it.

123
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play a lot of console games this week, funny enough.

124
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,400
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Season 1 of Sam & Max.

125
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't installed it yet, though, but I'm planning on playing it.

126
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:43,141
[SPEAKER_07]: My computer's kind of on the fritz right now.

127
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:46,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Something's going out in it because it randomly shuts off

128
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:51,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm thinking either the power supply, hard drive, or motherboard is going out.

129
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:53,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, I need to upgrade the damn thing.

130
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:54,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been like years.

131
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:03,065
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to the chat room, the always present chat.orangeonestradio.com, always the fourth guest, always has been for the past five years, always will be.

132
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:05,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start out with this lovely comment tonight.

133
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:09,870
[SPEAKER_06]: RossDLUT in chat says, Sky, God, stop sucking GameTac's cock.

134
00:11:11,111 --> 00:11:11,591
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I...

135
00:11:13,064 --> 00:11:14,485
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd think I'm on their payroll or something.

136
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:15,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God I'm not.

137
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:18,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a pretty good thing.

138
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,648
[SPEAKER_06]: It's relatively cheap.

139
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:20,688
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a lot of games.

140
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:21,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a bad deal.

141
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,050
[SPEAKER_06]: If I like something, I'm going to tell you I like it.

142
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about Xbox Live all the time.

143
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:26,532
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not on their payroll.

144
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:28,213
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not on anybody's payroll.

145
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:32,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of wish I was getting some nookie from all these people.

146
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:35,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to hire me to rub them while they're naked.

147
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,380
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to give a little massage-lovin' to GameTap?

148
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I would love to go to the video game companies and be their massage therapist.

149
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you give out some happy endings?

150
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you give Reggie a happy ending?

151
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:47,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob?

152
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:50,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's funny in any way.

153
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:54,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Blackboy in the chatroom says, Loki should buy a new MacBook.

154
00:11:55,069 --> 00:12:00,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh, that's funny, because see, the next computer I'm buying, my benchmark is it's going to be able to run Crysis very well.

155
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:05,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So, unfortunately, a MacBook would just, like, explode by...

156
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:08,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, even thinking about running Crysis, so...

157
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

158
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:10,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

159
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:14,333
[SPEAKER_06]: What wasn't so negative that was said in chat here that we could also read?

160
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:19,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitstun says, I like GameTap so far, but I don't have the disk space or clock speed for any of the newer stuff.

161
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:20,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

162
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:27,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I replaced my computer about a year and a half ago, so it's a little bit newer, so it can run some of these more higher-end stuff.

163
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:32,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And some folks who haven't replaced their computer in a few years are probably struggling a little more.

164
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:33,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the process of rebuilding.

165
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:37,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not necessarily rebuilding, but I'm adding in stuff to the one that was given to me.

166
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:38,410
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

167
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

168
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:40,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I redownloaded MAME today, and...

169
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Freak's Fifth Mix

170
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:15,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

171
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:17,478
[SPEAKER_07]: They also have 3rd Korean on there, which I thought was kind of funny.

172
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:19,639
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually have DDR games playable in MAME?

173
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I never knew that.

174
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:20,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

175
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,020
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of weird.

176
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're playable well, like audio problems, but I don't know.

177
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:29,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you, have they actually enabled the new Capcom board?

178
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:31,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember last week we reported that like Street Fighter 3 and stuff.

179
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:32,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's now in there?

180
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think so.

181
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:35,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember seeing some.

182
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

183
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the Sega boards emulated.

184
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:43,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want Planet Harrier.

185
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

186
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,501
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, that was our gaming week.

187
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get on to some other stuff before we get into the news, like some housekeeping.

188
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:12,424
[SPEAKER_06]: We just wanted to say tonight, of course, you know, it's our fifth anniversary show.

189
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a whole lot, you know, I don't know.

190
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:20,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you guys feel, but I wasn't really all about kind of like tooting our own horns tonight.

191
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:21,708
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is more like...

192
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:22,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

193
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's get on to the gaming news!

194
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:04,085
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

195
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,241
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

196
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:57,784
[SPEAKER_06]: They should rate it AO in America, and it turns out, oh, the game has been rated AO here in America, adults only, which is a rating that's been reserved for very, very few games.

197
00:15:57,984 --> 00:16:03,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of very under-the-radar type of, like, sex games have gotten this type of rating.

198
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:04,249
[SPEAKER_07]: All on PC, by the way.

199
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're all PC.

200
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:14,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because, and then the next part of this was, if the game has continued to stay rated AO, the Nintendo will not endorse it, Sony will not endorse it, and Microsoft will not allow it.

201
00:16:14,637 --> 00:16:14,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is fucked up.

202
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,718
[SPEAKER_07]: They will all not allow the product to come on the systems.

203
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:17,499
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucked up.

204
00:16:18,537 --> 00:16:22,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the first question I'm going to ask, and maybe somebody's already asked this.

205
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you know the answer.

206
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,362
[SPEAKER_06]: What about a Renegade release?

207
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:28,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember back in the day, remember on Nintendo?

208
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:33,428
[SPEAKER_06]: There were companies that would make games without the official Nintendo CO quality, like Color Dreams.

209
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:39,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember those ugly-ass blue cartridges and the really horrible games that came out from them?

210
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:40,654
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do it.

211
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking maybe it's because Take-Two is a big, big publisher.

212
00:16:45,096 --> 00:16:46,097
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to burn their bridges.

213
00:16:46,177 --> 00:16:57,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not only that, but they could still release everything Renegade or whatever, but I think now that they actually do have to get everything licensed in order to be able to actually press this.

214
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:02,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why everything has to go through certification before it can actually go gold and get disc-pressed on it.

215
00:17:03,127 --> 00:17:05,469
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

216
00:17:05,868 --> 00:17:22,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why they... I wish... The whole thing between AO and Mature is retarded anyways, because what you're saying is this game is not suitable for 17-year-olds, which, I don't know, Hustle 2 out there, it's all about torture and people's limbs getting chopped off and rape and stuff.

217
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Naked chicks dancing in blood.

218
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:32,564
[SPEAKER_07]: And naked chicks dancing in blood, and that's suitable for 17-year-olds, but, oh, a pixelated video game, oh, okay, well that's way...

219
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:37,015
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-year-olds that go, oh, wait, this is teaching me how to commit murder.

220
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:39,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to go murder somebody now.

221
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:39,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

222
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, grow the fuck up.

223
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:45,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're all, well, this is to keep it out of our children's hands.

224
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,120
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not supposed to be in children's hands.

225
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,620
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking 17 and over.

226
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick comments from chat room.

227
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

228
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Corey31 says, but no stores will sell it.

229
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:56,503
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the main problem.

230
00:17:56,723 --> 00:18:00,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex Silvara follows up, Walmart, Target, Blockbuster wouldn't sell it.

231
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:00,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

232
00:18:00,984 --> 00:18:02,485
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a selling point for the independents.

233
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,925
[SPEAKER_07]: No, independent stores would carry that shit.

234
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:09,211
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, when they heard that it was going to be adults only and that Blockbuster, Gamefly...

235
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:12,683
[SPEAKER_07]: and Walmart weren't going to be carrying it, they're like, I'll double my order.

236
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:15,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So that shit would still sell.

237
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:18,247
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not sell as fast, but it would still sell.

238
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:20,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a comment from Take-Two.

239
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:25,291
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually comes from, I'm not sure who at Take-Two.

240
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:26,772
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a general comment from Take-Two.

241
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:31,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, the ESRB has issued an initial rating of AO, adults only, for Manhunt 2.

242
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:34,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is an actual statement they made.

243
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:39,780
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe the process of rating video games is to help people make informed entertainment choices and not to limit them.

244
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Manhunt 2 is created for mature audiences, and we strongly believe it should receive an M rating, aligning it with similar content created in other forms of media.

245
00:18:47,823 --> 00:18:51,125
[SPEAKER_06]: We are exploring other options with regards to Manhunt 2.

246
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:54,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I do think that they're unfairly being targeted.

247
00:18:54,606 --> 00:19:01,950
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always, you know, Take-Two is always the target of, you know, both advocates for, like, you know...

248
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:03,973
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

249
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,770
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

250
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:57,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the wrong person to ask.

251
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have that too.

252
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't have the Wii mode.

253
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't actually pretend I am chopping Wiemers off and whatever.

254
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:20,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I can slice people across their abdomen in Trauma Center and that's rewarding.

255
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:21,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Good point.

256
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's the thing.

257
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:28,209
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's rated AO for the Wii because you're simulating murder in that.

258
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is the PlayStation 2 one rated AO as well?

259
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:32,468
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

260
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Afterplay to Black Devil Rx

261
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:28,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Next can have orifices if you have a tracheotomy or you cut someone's head off.

262
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,379
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the comment?

263
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,880
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a comment about neck rape on there.

264
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

265
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I also want to read another comment from BlackDevilRx.

266
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Adults only is a stupid rating.

267
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:39,541
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no need for it.

268
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:45,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be more like an NC-17 thing because right now they're saying that adults aren't mature, which is the rating below AO, so...

269
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:47,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

270
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

271
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:27,914
[SPEAKER_06]: and Hostel or Hostel Part 2, which had a lower rating.

272
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:29,155
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little sex.

273
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:32,457
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, that might not be a fair comparison because we're talking about sex versus violence.

274
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:33,557
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here with Manhunt.

275
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:34,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all violence.

276
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:41,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's just like, you know, with a lot of the ratings on these games and stuff, Grand Theft Auto, there's a perfect example.

277
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:49,706
[SPEAKER_07]: San Andreas, that game had a bunch of murdering and killing of people and stuff, but oh my God, show a little bit of digital boobie and boom, A-O.

278
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:52,688
[SPEAKER_07]: See, double fucking standards right there.

279
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:52,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

280
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:57,267
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just so... I don't even know what the problem is with these people.

281
00:22:57,827 --> 00:23:00,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, granted, it is an adult-only game.

282
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:04,931
[SPEAKER_07]: And mature, I would think, pretty much satisfies that.

283
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:11,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Because 17 and older, 18 and older, I think between 17 and 18, for the most part, people aren't maturing that much.

284
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:17,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think at 17, you probably know right and wrong about as much as you do when you're 18.

285
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the level of the...

286
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The dividing line of maturity is when you start paying your own bills.

287
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:25,016
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually a really good point.

288
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:25,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.

289
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people in their 20s that live with mommy and daddy that aren't as mature as some people I know that moved out at 17.

290
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:35,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why they don't just have M as the cap off for that, you know, or...

291
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,565
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

292
00:23:55,045 --> 00:24:23,335
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think to an extent that's what they kind of tried to do with the ESRB is I think they tried to copy the movie ratings without copying them so I think like an M rating is supposed to be like R no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian and same thing they would sell you a game as long as your mommy or daddy is there with you and the clerk says what's in the game but AO is like NC-17 no one under 17 admitted period parents or not this is just not an acceptable thing

293
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:26,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, and that would be, I think, the thing with the AO rating.

294
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:29,415
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this game has not sold to anyone over 80.

295
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:30,536
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like cigarettes.

296
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:31,876
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not sell it under any circumstance.

297
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:33,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, you know, the M-rated games.

298
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:37,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are not intended to be played by kids that are under 17.

299
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it is, in a sense, like the, you know, NC-17.

300
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,460
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just people don't treat it that way.

301
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And then until someone goes and murders somebody, then they're all, oh, my God, it was the game's fault.

302
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:50,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea.

303
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:50,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

304
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:53,917
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

305
00:25:10,113 --> 00:25:11,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Some interesting stuff.

306
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:20,603
[SPEAKER_07]: This has kind of been a trend with Microsoft right now, securing a lot of exclusive rights to things, one of which being Grand Theft Auto 4 episodic content.

307
00:25:21,003 --> 00:25:33,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they've spent $50 million in securing this episodic content, which to me, that seems like an awful lot of money to spend to secure content for a game that's downloadable.

308
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:35,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be very interested if...

309
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,486
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some announcements at E3 or something.

310
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:47,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking that maybe they're going to announce that it's going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive for the game because that's quite a bit of money that they're throwing at them.

311
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:49,168
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever, either way.

312
00:25:50,928 --> 00:26:02,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, so if you own the 360, you're going to be able to download, I guess, the episodic content in about two batches, one of which is supposed to hit mid-next year and then the rest at the end of next year.

313
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:03,871
[SPEAKER_07]: So $25 million for each.

314
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,561
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

315
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:32,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say they sell 5 million copies of the game, at least, on Xbox 360.

316
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,804
[SPEAKER_06]: They sell 5 million copies of the game, and people are going to download this.

317
00:26:35,824 --> 00:26:38,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say they charge $10 for the episodic content.

318
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:40,909
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to make their $50 million back right there.

319
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:47,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, granted, I'm assuming that everybody's going to buy it, which isn't going to happen, but I'm only considering one piece of downloadable content for $10.

320
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:52,579
[SPEAKER_06]: If they release three pieces of downloadable content for $10, they'll more than make their money back, and then some.

321
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:57,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, they have something that Sony doesn't, which in the end might move some consoles and so on and so on.

322
00:26:57,787 --> 00:27:00,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know people that are holding out for this game.

323
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:05,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, gamer picks and themes and all sorts of crap that they can market using Grand Theft Auto.

324
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:08,895
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

325
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:11,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

326
00:27:12,017 --> 00:27:15,500
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, I'm not too surprised that they're actually doing this.

327
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the PlayStation Network so far, downloadable content for games has been almost non-existent.

328
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:34,659
[SPEAKER_06]: So now just to clear this up, because I'm still a little unsure on this, because I seem to remember when this game was first announced, they said, okay, the PlayStation 3 is going to have this downloadable content, and the Xbox 360 will have this different downloadable content.

329
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft is basically paid to stop the PlayStation 3 exclusive content from coming out at all.

330
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

331
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:42,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

332
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:51,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's why they did it, to try and move some more systems and get people, because the game will be that much more on the 360.

333
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this isn't the first game that they were doing this.

334
00:27:55,523 --> 00:28:00,707
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, now they're saying that Beautiful Katamari is going to be a 360 exclusive as well.

335
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:01,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows about that?

336
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:04,430
[SPEAKER_06]: GS191 says something interesting.

337
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,613
[SPEAKER_06]: The three items for download, a gun, a car, and a sex minigame.

338
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:10,838
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be stupid shit like that.

339
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:15,662
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be actual episodic, brand new storylines and stuff like that.

340
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:17,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like you get a brand new gun.

341
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:22,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackboy says Take-Two is actually talking about selling 10 million units by the end of 2008.

342
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:24,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We shall see.

343
00:28:44,693 --> 00:29:01,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of downloadable content, Eidos UK has said that the Tomb Raider Anniversary for Xbox 360 is, well, going to be available as a series of downloads in conjunction with Tomb Raider Legend.

344
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:14,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, you're downloading each of them as different, I guess, different parts of the game, with free downloads being available

345
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura's Manor, all that type of stuff.

346
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,935
[SPEAKER_02]: However, each of these episodes are going to be about $30 a piece, 2,400 Microsoft points.

347
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:28,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't suppose there will be a downloadable topless Laura patch like there was on the PC versions.

348
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,541
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

349
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:31,422
[SPEAKER_06]: That's most unfortunate.

350
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:35,466
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that the first two are going to be available in September.

351
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:36,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

352
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:39,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know though, I kind of don't care about Tomb Raider anymore.

353
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:47,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I played that Tomb Raider game on 360, didn't really, like the full, I don't even remember what it was called, the retail release that came out a few months ago, didn't really dig it.

354
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,060
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of over Lara Croft.

355
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:56,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't really cared about her since you could throw her off the balcony in Tomb Raider 2 and break her neck and do the exploding code.

356
00:29:56,422 --> 00:29:57,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of fun to kill her off.

357
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:00,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And lock her up, butler in the lock-in freezer.

358
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:01,804
[SPEAKER_02]: The lock-in freezer.

359
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:02,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you really do that?

360
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:03,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you could.

361
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:05,325
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way you could keep them from following you.

362
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,225
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

363
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,594
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

364
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:38,259
[SPEAKER_06]: A Donkey Kong Bongo Blast and Tarou Jet Race is coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 28th.

365
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that is the bongoless bongo game because you have the Wiimotes.

366
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:43,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Baroque

367
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:07,342
[SPEAKER_06]: from Sting, a special edition of Devil May Cry 3, but that's just a price reduction, really.

368
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:12,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, an earlier version of Dragon Quest goes into the Ultimate Hits Collection.

369
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe this is one of the side quest stories.

370
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:27,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, a special edition thing for Devil May Cry 3, I believe is the one that they released over here, where it was the greatest hits, but they also added an additional playable character and additional difficulties.

371
00:31:28,499 --> 00:31:32,081
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a reduction for a Dragon Quest VIII spinoff story that was on the PlayStation 2.

372
00:31:32,322 --> 00:31:33,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't remember this game being here.

373
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they ever ported this over here.

374
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:38,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps somebody else in our chatroom knows a little more about that game.

375
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:39,926
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think that game ever came out here.

376
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:43,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's because the game is way bigger over in Japan.

377
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:47,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out, Metal Slug on the PlayStation 2.

378
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:48,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

379
00:31:48,652 --> 00:31:49,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving into the best hits.

380
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:49,753
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

381
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:50,013
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

382
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:50,513
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

383
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:51,934
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

384
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Metal Slug.

385
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:56,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll kill you.

386
00:31:58,129 --> 00:31:58,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

387
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:05,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out on June 28th in Japan, Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra.

388
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:05,811
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

389
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:07,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

390
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:07,631
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

391
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:13,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they keep putting out games for that anime that's been, what, 10 years gone now?

392
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:14,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people buy them.

393
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones on Saturn sucked.

394
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on Nintendo 64 sucked.

395
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:19,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they keep doing it?

396
00:32:20,382 --> 00:32:21,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Tales of Fandom Vol.

397
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:26,367
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 coming out from Namco Bandai on June 28th, also on the PlayStation 2.

398
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:31,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Taito Memories, also known as Eternal Hits, coming out in two versions.

399
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:33,352
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Gekkan and Jukkan.

400
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:39,837
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that's very similar to what we have over here is the Taito Greatest Hits Collection, the comparable thing we have here already in America.

401
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:41,654
[SPEAKER_06]: also coming out in Japan.

402
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:45,757
[SPEAKER_06]: The King of Fighters 11 moving into the Best Hits collection on the 28th.

403
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:48,719
[SPEAKER_06]: SNK is moving a lot of stuff into Best Hits on PlayStation 2.

404
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,322
[SPEAKER_06]: We're quickly checking the handheld systems.

405
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:56,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Kurikuri DS is coming out on June 28th.

406
00:32:56,525 --> 00:32:57,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Otasuke Island.

407
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:01,528
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like one of those cute little chibi games.

408
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's an action game.

409
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like with bunnies.

410
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:07,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And an angry pink bunny sailing a ship.

411
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:07,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's...

412
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Otona no Joryoku Kentai

413
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:37,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of releases here on June 28th.

414
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:41,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratchet & Clank gets its BSP release on June 28th.

415
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:50,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And just for Jamie, Secret of Evangelion Portable coming out on the 28th.

416
00:33:51,784 --> 00:33:52,144
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

417
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:58,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish it was all Neon Genesis over here, too.

418
00:33:58,268 --> 00:33:58,828
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be funny.

419
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:00,451
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not.

420
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:03,733
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyways, next week there's a ton of releases.

421
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:06,354
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them coming out based on movies.

422
00:34:06,995 --> 00:34:09,336
[SPEAKER_07]: One of which is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

423
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,657
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be coming out on almost everything.

424
00:34:11,857 --> 00:34:17,960
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 2, PSP, 360, PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

425
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,301
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP and I believe DS also.

426
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:24,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, of course, Ratatouille.

427
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,064
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be coming out on almost everything.

428
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:27,505
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 2, GameCube.

429
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:32,177
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii, DS, and PSP.

430
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Transformers, that's going to be coming out on all the console systems, so that'll be pretty cool.

431
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:48,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the Wii, we've got Pokemon Battle Revolution, so that's pretty slick.

432
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:57,338
[SPEAKER_07]: The Biggs is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PlayStation 3, and 360, kind of like an arcade-style baseball game.

433
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:00,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Grim Grimoire is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

434
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:02,284
[SPEAKER_07]: That one's supposed to be pretty good.

435
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:10,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, PSP, just this small little game called Final Fantasy is going to be coming out as well.

436
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,311
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that game about?

437
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:13,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard of it.

438
00:35:13,432 --> 00:35:16,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I hear it's kind of a Japanese-style game.

439
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:17,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, then never mind.

440
00:35:17,855 --> 00:35:19,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I'll be playing that.

441
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:23,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, of course, this is actually something I'm interested in, TraxPad.

442
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,001
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a portable...

443
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Music Studio type thing.

444
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to be picking that up.

445
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:32,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe make some music with that.

446
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:37,648
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on 360 also we had Hour of Victory coming out.

447
00:35:37,828 --> 00:35:39,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Overlord is making its way out here.

448
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And on PlayStation 3, hopefully, Rainbow Six Vegas.

449
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:48,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that thing's been delayed so many freaking times.

450
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:51,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that's it.

451
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some stuff.

452
00:35:53,677 --> 00:35:54,057
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

453
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:55,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose release dates do you have?

454
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:57,620
[SPEAKER_02]: These are UK release dates.

455
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:03,023
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 26th, we have Cosmic Family for Wii and Harry Potter and the Odor of Phoenix.

456
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:04,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Odor.

457
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:04,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Odor.

458
00:36:05,865 --> 00:36:07,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a bunch of crap on the 29th.

459
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:11,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars on PSP.

460
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Crazy Taxi.

461
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:14,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy Taxi.

462
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:19,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Driver Parallel Lines, Final Fantasy VI Advance, which I already have in my purse.

463
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:29,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Hour of Victory, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition, More Brain Training from Dr. Kalashima, How Old is Your Brain, Project Silphid, I want Project Silphid!

464
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:30,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

465
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:31,488
[SPEAKER_07]: A few more weeks.

466
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:33,629
[SPEAKER_02]: A few more weeks.

467
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:35,509
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you have no idea.

468
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the shit out of Silphid on the Sega CD.

469
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:39,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Second week in July.

470
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:43,613
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw the thing for Project Silphid, I about...

471
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:47,491
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

472
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:12,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a bad fanfiction.

473
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter 2.

474
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Vegas.

475
00:37:19,653 --> 00:37:19,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

476
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:21,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Vampire Reign.

477
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Agon, Lost Swords of Toledo.

478
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:25,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like Ohio?

479
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:26,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this Toledo?

480
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:28,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Ohio?

481
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:31,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're going to Ohio to look for the sword.

482
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:34,886
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eye of Shit, I mean Eye of Judgment.

483
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:37,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, Eye of Judgment?

484
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:37,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, no, no, no.

485
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:38,429
[SPEAKER_00]: PlayStation 3.

486
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:40,157
[SPEAKER_06]: and Steel Horizons.

487
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, there's a few that I missed for the US.

488
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:54,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Darkness, which isn't just a fan fiction, I hope you know.

489
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:57,978
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a Top Cow comic, I believe.

490
00:37:58,618 --> 00:38:00,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was published by Image as well.

491
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:08,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Being made into a live action movie as well, it's kind of like a cross between demonic possession and a mafia story type thing.

492
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically rip people apart with demons.

493
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:11,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

494
00:38:12,864 --> 00:38:13,364
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the other one?

495
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:15,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Driver Parallel Lines for the Wii.

496
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,786
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, you probably don't want to pick that one up anyways, so.

497
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:19,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Darkness.

498
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:24,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that a cliche thing to call your game or whatever?

499
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:25,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Darkness?

500
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:25,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

501
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:27,649
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the name of the comic book series.

502
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:28,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, fine.

503
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:28,829
[SPEAKER_07]: The Darkness.

504
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:30,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

505
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the demonic thing that possessed him.

506
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,891
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anything else, DarkSakura for our UK listeners?

507
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:35,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mom.

508
00:38:36,372 --> 00:38:36,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

509
00:38:36,832 --> 00:38:38,332
[SPEAKER_06]: What platform is she coming out on?

510
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:39,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The Last Night platform.

511
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:40,013
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

512
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,481
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

513
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you'll notice that the Wii, now people don't really know what this is.

514
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:13,537
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is like a typo, if they just meant to put Dr. Mario and they put like the Wii or whatever is in there.

515
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:16,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if this is actually like a whole new game.

516
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, wouldn't that be something?

517
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:21,740
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole new game based on Dr. Mario.

518
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:23,501
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like fun to me.

519
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:31,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be really impressed if it were SNK, but unfortunately... I don't think it would be, seeing as Dr. Mario is a Nintendo license.

520
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:34,635
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm talking about the whole new game part.

521
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:35,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

522
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:39,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well that's pretty much it, so be on the lookout for that.

523
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:42,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully that Dr. Mario Wii thing is a new thing.

524
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:48,821
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in my mind, if that is something new, that would be the perfect thing to release the week of E3.

525
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:49,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark my words.

526
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:51,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Mario Wii.

527
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:53,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a start.

528
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:58,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, you know, probably a game that a lot of us are going to get super-duper excited about, but it's a start.

529
00:39:58,423 --> 00:40:00,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something we don't have yet.

530
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:00,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

531
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:03,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something new being made for the Wii, if that makes any sense.

532
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:06,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better than Everybody Votes Channel, okay?

533
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:07,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just leave it at that.

534
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:10,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody Votes Channel!

535
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody votes to change this channel.

536
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:15,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate that channel, by the way.

537
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, completely useless.

538
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:19,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

539
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

540
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:24,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting rumor, kind of also associated with Nintendo here.

541
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:34,321
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be that they will be licensing their properties to be made into games onto the Apple iPhone.

542
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:46,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone remembers that back in the day there was a certain platform which they licensed their games to be made onto.

543
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, CDI games didn't turn out very well.

544
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:58,095
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently they're supposed to be coming out on the iPhone priced at about $29 each.

545
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:06,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So is $29 worth paying for a downloadable game that's going to be probably a remake of Mario Bros.?

546
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:08,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

547
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:09,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds more like a rumor to me.

548
00:41:11,016 --> 00:41:14,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the most interesting thing about this story, like I could kind of care less about the game.

549
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:20,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally am not interested in the iPhone, but I have a lot of friends who are like doing the campout thing and all that crap to get this stupid phone.

550
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my thing, but I don't have $600 to burn.

551
00:41:24,322 --> 00:41:26,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But for those that want it, hey, good for you.

552
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:26,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have a loan?

553
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:32,545
[SPEAKER_06]: But the point behind this story, Yuri Lover in chat sums it up perfectly.

554
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:34,646
[SPEAKER_06]: OMG, Nintendo and Apple are in bed together.

555
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:38,927
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what the fanboys wanted years ago.

556
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,588
[SPEAKER_06]: They kept saying, gee, Nintendo likes to put cute things out.

557
00:41:42,988 --> 00:41:45,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Apple likes to put cute things out in different colors, just like Nintendo.

558
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:47,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Why aren't these companies in bed together?

559
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:49,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And here they go.

560
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:52,770
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little foreplay going on here with this story, right?

561
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this foreplay?

562
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a rumor, to be honest.

563
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You think this is just bullshit?

564
00:41:58,611 --> 00:41:59,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is bullshit, but...

565
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:03,458
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it wouldn't surprise me that they're going to try to whore themselves out.

566
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:10,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wouldn't surprise me that stupid morons that pay $600 for a fucking phone would pay $30 for downloadable content on said phone.

567
00:42:11,523 --> 00:42:13,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Geniuses that buy this shit.

568
00:42:13,404 --> 00:42:14,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So, way to go.

569
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,006
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

570
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:20,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you should go purchase a PlayStation 3 while you're at it since you have all this excess money to throw around.

571
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you just mad because you're poor?

572
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:25,632
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't want this fucking phone.

573
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:27,093
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not pay $600 for a goddamn phone.

574
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, for anyone who is one of our friends in the UK, they just got a big treat on the virtual console.

575
00:42:35,363 --> 00:42:35,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what's out?

576
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:37,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man!

577
00:42:38,104 --> 00:42:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mom, oh.

578
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:41,566
[SPEAKER_02]: No, my mom doesn't put out for anything.

579
00:42:41,586 --> 00:42:42,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Mom.

580
00:42:43,547 --> 00:42:50,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man just made it out for 500 Wii points, and from TurboGrafx-16, China Warriors is another new one on there.

581
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,771
[SPEAKER_02]: They are both games from 1989.

582
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:52,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

583
00:42:57,245 --> 00:43:01,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm just excited about Mega Man because, you know, all the Mega Man 2, though, was really the better game.

584
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:03,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man, though, was really cool.

585
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the ones that has beaten.

586
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:12,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Mega Man and all, but what about, you know, the whole Mega Man collection that was on GameCube and the Wii's backwards compatible, you know?

587
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:13,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Do people care?

588
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:14,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me.

589
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to spend money on the virtual console Mega Man when that game's out there.

590
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:20,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, neither am I. I mean, I have the freaking cartridge.

591
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,996
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I can't lend you one of my Nintendos, but that's another story.

592
00:43:25,618 --> 00:43:26,518
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know...

593
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,822
[SPEAKER_02]: But for people who may not have bought the collection or may just say, oh, well, that's pretty cool, Mega Man.

594
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:34,042
[SPEAKER_02]: They might want to get it.

595
00:43:34,282 --> 00:43:37,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, for lazy people who are one-click shoppers.

596
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:37,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

597
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:38,363
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

598
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:38,743
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

599
00:43:38,803 --> 00:43:39,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

600
00:43:39,603 --> 00:43:39,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

601
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:40,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Then carry on.

602
00:43:40,664 --> 00:43:41,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And talk to me later about the Nintendo.

603
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:42,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Carry on.

604
00:43:42,724 --> 00:43:43,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say you can?

605
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:44,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like three.

606
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:45,305
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow one.

607
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:45,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

608
00:43:45,725 --> 00:43:46,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you said you can't.

609
00:43:46,946 --> 00:43:47,026
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

610
00:43:47,046 --> 00:43:47,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, okay.

611
00:43:47,806 --> 00:43:48,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, ma'am.

612
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:49,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow one of our older ones.

613
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:49,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Swell.

614
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:52,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally going to get a copy of Guardian Legend for myself.

615
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:53,687
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow mine, too, if you want.

616
00:43:54,408 --> 00:43:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesomeness.

617
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:55,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not playing it.

618
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,611
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can only tear myself away from World of Warcraft.

619
00:43:58,632 --> 00:44:05,779
[SPEAKER_07]: There are free, easier methods to obtain Guardian Legends to play it on a console.

620
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:06,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same.

621
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same.

622
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:08,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't explain it.

623
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:09,523
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same.

624
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Those little imperfections bug me.

625
00:44:11,865 --> 00:44:17,290
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something rewarding about blowing on the cartridge and putting it in the machine and it'll finally work at some point.

626
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:18,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

627
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,693
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something rewarding about that.

628
00:44:20,578 --> 00:44:29,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully there's a lot of rewards from this game as well, or else there's going to be a lot of people that are pissed off because Spore, which you might remember was my favorite game I saw at last year's E3.

629
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:38,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm going to be waiting a long freaking time to play this game, as are all of you, because this game has been pushed back to the fiscal year 2009.

630
00:44:40,354 --> 00:44:44,618
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that it will, at earliest, come out in April of 2008.

631
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:50,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, some folks were, you know, this game was already supposed to be out.

632
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it got pushed back to this fiscal year.

633
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:54,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it got pushed back to next fiscal year.

634
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it was like, oh, it's going to come out by the Christmas.

635
00:44:56,747 --> 00:44:57,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's going to come out first quarter 2008.

636
00:44:58,727 --> 00:44:59,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go again.

637
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:04,069
[SPEAKER_06]: It just got delayed to April 2008 at the earliest.

638
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:09,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so weird because when we saw the demo, I was like, this game looks like it's almost done.

639
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,330
[SPEAKER_06]: The game looks great.

640
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:15,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe that's why they only showed us one element of the game.

641
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:16,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe looks can be deceiving.

642
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:17,032
[SPEAKER_06]: But

643
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:18,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

644
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:21,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that it's a massive game and they want to make sure they get it right.

645
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:21,777
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

646
00:45:22,057 --> 00:45:22,938
[SPEAKER_02]: For a change!

647
00:45:23,078 --> 00:45:23,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

648
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Gerardimo calls this game in our chatroom Spore Forever.

649
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:30,105
[SPEAKER_06]: A little play on Duke Nukem Forever.

650
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:30,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

651
00:45:31,149 --> 00:45:47,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but at least we've actually seen screenshots and like, you know, playable sport, like, you know, because they show, I mean, even though you weren't able to play the demo yourself, they did kind of like a, you know, a user-assisted tutorial type thing at E3 and it looked pretty awesome.

652
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:51,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was awesome enough to get me the most excited over any other game I saw at E3 last year.

653
00:45:51,951 --> 00:45:52,912
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked awesome.

654
00:45:53,843 --> 00:45:56,966
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, I am pissed off about the fact that this game is delayed.

655
00:45:57,006 --> 00:46:04,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how Loki and DarkSakura feel, but since I'm at the soundboard and I'm angry enough, I push the button and out come the FUs.

656
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:16,722
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, start us off.

657
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:18,603
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to life.

658
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:21,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to hear that.

659
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:22,026
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it?

660
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:22,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

661
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:23,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

662
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:26,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a good blanket FU to kind of encompass everything.

663
00:46:27,332 --> 00:46:29,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because there's a whole bunch of shit going on, so FU to all of it.

664
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:30,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to hear that.

665
00:46:31,013 --> 00:46:31,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

666
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:38,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, I would like to repeat my distaste for Street Smart Cool Cat.

667
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:46,097
[SPEAKER_07]: That fucking idiot can die in a fire, and I hope your game sucks balls and does not sell one piece.

668
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It is horrible, and you need to stop.

669
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:59,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to say F you to Bobby Blackwolf for correcting me in chat saying Duke Nukem Forever was playable at E3 1998 on the Quake 2 engine.

670
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:02,259
[SPEAKER_06]: F you, Bobby.

671
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:05,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And your old show, 100 Weeks, whatever.

672
00:47:06,464 --> 00:47:06,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

673
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:08,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding, I heart Bobby.

674
00:47:09,323 --> 00:47:14,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to say a big F you to the DMV.

675
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:17,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have to go there tomorrow and nobody likes going to the DMV.

676
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:24,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have to get my license renewed because my birthday is coming up and I got to get that all taken care of before my birthday or else I won't have a driver's license.

677
00:47:24,832 --> 00:47:26,833
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the possibility I may not have a driver's license.

678
00:47:30,595 --> 00:47:30,895
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

679
00:47:31,656 --> 00:47:41,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so there's something actually pretty cool coming out of the homebrew scene, and that is a sequel, a homebrew sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.

680
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:43,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually looks pretty cool.

681
00:47:43,702 --> 00:47:56,969
[SPEAKER_07]: The name of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog XG, or Extended Genesis, and pretty much captures the original Sonic the Hedgehog game series very accurately.

682
00:47:57,029 --> 00:47:58,290
[SPEAKER_07]: It's scheduled to have

683
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:28,244
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 unique zones, 18 acts along with his secret zone after Chaos Central and no word though on what it's coming out on I would assume PC but pretty awesome they have a video on Destructoid if you want to check it out really cool looking game I'm not really a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog series so hopefully it gets released and you can download it before Sega's lawyers get on them that would be nice

684
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:36,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, other Sonic news that I think is actually kind of cool is Bioware is doing a Sonic RPG that's going to be on the Nintendo DS.

685
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be out in 2008.

686
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:49,680
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a whole bunch out on it, but it's just saying that Sega is standing behind what Bioware has planned doing and Bioware wants to do it, blah, blah, blah.

687
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I hope it's good.

688
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.

689
00:48:52,981 --> 00:48:57,603
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they did good stuff for... Didn't they do Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic?

690
00:48:57,703 --> 00:48:57,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

691
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,244
[SPEAKER_07]: and the upcoming Mass Effect game, which is going to be like one of the best role-playing games for the 360.

692
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:05,984
[SPEAKER_06]: You hope.

693
00:49:06,765 --> 00:49:09,146
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks... It does look pretty freaking amazing.

694
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:09,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

695
00:49:11,788 --> 00:49:16,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I hear about this, I think about the Mario RPG for some sick reason.

696
00:49:16,071 --> 00:49:29,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because, you know, Squeenix helped make, well, it was just Square back then, but Squaresoft made the, you know, Mario RPG game and that was like a top-of-the-line developer, especially back at that time at the, you know, I remember Final Fantasy was like all the rage at that point, you know.

697
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:36,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of interesting that now you have this Bioware who's kind of like, you know, also an A-list developer kind of making this Sonic RPG.

698
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:40,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope it doesn't blow chunks like all the other Sonic games that have come out in the past three years.

699
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:42,755
[SPEAKER_06]: My thoughts exactly.

700
00:49:43,115 --> 00:49:49,217
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me also pissed off because remember there was, I think, Square Enix was saying that they wanted to dedicate themselves to the Nintendo platforms.

701
00:49:49,517 --> 00:49:51,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Make me another goddamn Super Mario RPG!

702
00:49:52,138 --> 00:49:56,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you've dedicated yourself to the Nintendo platforms, why don't you make yourself useful?

703
00:49:57,546 --> 00:50:00,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Do that instead of making another fucking sequel to Final Fantasy 7.

704
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:05,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a BlackDevilerX in chat says, Sega and Bioware are in bed.

705
00:50:06,616 --> 00:50:08,198
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of in bed stories tonight.

706
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:08,799
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with that?

707
00:50:09,419 --> 00:50:09,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

708
00:50:10,438 --> 00:50:10,978
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

709
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:36,050
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

710
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:03,655
[SPEAKER_06]: says, quote, there seems to be some misinformation flying around.

711
00:51:04,036 --> 00:51:11,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing's changed since our call on May 8th, where John Riccatello specifically said that we were removing Spore from fiscal 08 to early fiscal 09.

712
00:51:13,482 --> 00:51:16,524
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe that Spore thing wasn't news after all.

713
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:17,445
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm still angsty about it.

714
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:18,405
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a long time to wait.

715
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually still was thinking it was coming out Christmas this year.

716
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:22,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow missed the boat on that story.

717
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:23,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

718
00:51:24,127 --> 00:51:25,588
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, thanks for the corrections.

719
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:30,633
[SPEAKER_06]: We report on what's big on the gaming blogs out there and what catches our eye.

720
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not always going to be 100% on target.

721
00:51:34,577 --> 00:51:35,337
[SPEAKER_06]: But we try to get close.

722
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:39,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully this is accurate because this is something trying to foresee things a little bit.

723
00:51:39,381 --> 00:51:45,607
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be the list of Halo 3 achievements coming to you thanks to Xbox360achievements.org.

724
00:51:45,947 --> 00:51:50,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So for those of you that are achievement point whores, Loki, bye in the game.

725
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:52,703
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

726
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:25,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, some hidden skulls looking like they claim some different achievements throughout the game.

727
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,282
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course there's some various player versus player achievements.

728
00:52:29,943 --> 00:52:35,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Awards being given for triple kill, overkill, headshots and then some achievements.

729
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:37,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Headshots are the best.

730
00:52:37,528 --> 00:52:51,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Some achievements still in question because you actually see the achievement says score over X amount of points in the campaign made a game on the second mission for some various achievements named such thing as Demon, Gorilla, Vanguard, Reclaimer.

731
00:52:52,298 --> 00:52:55,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like about nine different achievements there so kind of interesting.

732
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:59,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what the achievements look like for Halo 3.

733
00:53:00,288 --> 00:53:03,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone was asking me in chat room what my favorite all-time first-person shooter is.

734
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,070
[SPEAKER_07]: TimeSplitters 2.

735
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking awesome game.

736
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:11,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, let's see here.

737
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:18,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's some interesting developments in the whole immersion thing.

738
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:24,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember back, immersion, of course, sued Sony over the rumble technology in their controllers.

739
00:53:25,362 --> 00:53:27,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now we've got Microsoft suing Immersion.

740
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:40,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason is, is because apparently because of the whole Sony lawsuit, and since they settled on that, that violates some sort of agreement that Microsoft had with Immersion when they were licensing the technology.

741
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:44,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And according to Microsoft, Microsoft licenses technology in both

742
00:53:44,597 --> 00:53:44,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor babies.

743
00:53:44,957 --> 00:53:45,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Aww.

744
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:15,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's pout and sue.

745
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:20,972
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly... Somebody remind me, because I haven't really been following the details of all these stories.

746
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:23,473
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just see the headlines and I go, oh, lawsuit, lawsuit.

747
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:25,854
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly has Immersion done for gaming?

748
00:54:26,894 --> 00:54:29,095
[SPEAKER_06]: They developed, apparently, Rumble technology.

749
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:32,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, they developed Rumble technology.

750
00:54:32,237 --> 00:54:39,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have trademarks, so... But was it one of those things where, like... Because I remember, did they develop the first... What is it?

751
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,161
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak was the first thing that had Rumble, right?

752
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:42,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

753
00:54:43,132 --> 00:54:43,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.

754
00:54:44,253 --> 00:54:45,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they develop that?

755
00:54:45,514 --> 00:54:46,675
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

756
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:54,042
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those companies that makes a patent or patents something and then sits on it until someone makes it and then they go and sue them.

757
00:54:55,303 --> 00:54:55,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

758
00:54:57,085 --> 00:55:01,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm like, what exactly has a merchant done besides sue people and get sued?

759
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:03,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, have they ever made a game?

760
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:05,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Have they ever made a third-party product?

761
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:06,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

762
00:55:06,914 --> 00:55:07,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

763
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:08,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

764
00:55:09,315 --> 00:55:12,356
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

765
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:42,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's website of the week is one that should be nearing dear to the hearts of anyone who has ever gotten married.

766
00:55:44,455 --> 00:55:46,436
[SPEAKER_02]: It's UglyDress.com.

767
00:55:47,396 --> 00:55:52,780
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows the worst bridesmaids' dresses ever with photographs.

768
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:54,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are really awful.

769
00:55:56,202 --> 00:56:00,866
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one on here that looks like a flag.

770
00:56:02,287 --> 00:56:04,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even joking, it's really nasty.

771
00:56:06,178 --> 00:56:15,340
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's, it's not just weddings either, it's, it's like ugly cakes and, uh, like ugly shoes and tuxedos and shit.

772
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just awful, awful stuff.

773
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:27,563
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some show that they all watch on Ventrilo in World of Warcraft, the guild, and it's something, it's very similar to what you're talking about.

774
00:56:27,603 --> 00:56:28,503
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's like, um,

775
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:29,811
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

776
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:58,447
[SPEAKER_06]: It picks up, so we just hear this random laughing, and we're like, what the hell is so goddamn funny?

777
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:04,609
[SPEAKER_06]: And she says, oh, I'm watching this show that's like some type of like, I don't know what it is, emergency makeover show.

778
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, I shouldn't have opened my mouth unless I could think of the name of the show.

779
00:57:09,571 --> 00:57:13,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I was kind of hoping that somebody in chat would know what it's about.

780
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:20,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I looked up Immersion Corporation, by the way, on Wikipedia.

781
00:57:20,974 --> 00:57:25,700
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf in chat came to save the day, because BlackWolf knows more about gaming than I do, apparently.

782
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,943
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf said, And I'm looking at Wikipedia here.

783
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:38,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion Corporation of San Jose, California is a developer of Haptic Technology.

784
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:39,936
[SPEAKER_06]: The company was founded in 1993.

785
00:57:40,336 --> 00:57:49,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion's technology is employed in automotive, entertainment, medical training, mobility, personal computing, and three-dimensional simulation applications.

786
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion's patent portfolio includes over 500 issues or pending patents in the U.S.

787
00:57:54,218 --> 00:57:54,918
[SPEAKER_06]: and other countries.

788
00:57:55,439 --> 00:58:00,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion was used as an example in an article on patent trolls by Game Daily Biz.

789
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess we're not the first people to say something about that.

790
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:05,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Kudos to Game Daily Biz.

791
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:07,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad they have something called Patent Trolls.

792
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,355
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of funny.

793
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:10,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, WonderDog, Harold, and Chat.

794
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:12,677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called What Not to Wear is the name of the show.

795
00:58:12,998 --> 00:58:13,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called What Not to Wear.

796
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:15,759
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should check out that show, DarkSakura.

797
00:58:15,799 --> 00:58:16,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that on TV?

798
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,701
[SPEAKER_02]: That requires watching television.

799
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:18,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that on style?

800
00:58:18,901 --> 00:58:19,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Use a torrent.

801
00:58:19,522 --> 00:58:19,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

802
00:58:20,302 --> 00:58:21,503
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on Style Network.

803
00:58:21,683 --> 00:58:22,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

804
00:58:22,263 --> 00:58:22,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I know this?

805
00:58:22,944 --> 00:58:23,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have that.

806
00:58:23,864 --> 00:58:25,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Because your wife probably watches it.

807
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:29,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally sounds like something your wife probably watches.

808
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:30,068
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

809
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:31,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

810
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:37,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trying to get caught up on some other chatroom comments here.

811
00:58:39,885 --> 00:58:46,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Saikun says, stop using us, Rob, because I guess I'm using the chatroom to do research tonight.

812
00:58:48,055 --> 00:58:49,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Video Game Addiction could possibly be a new diagnosis.

813
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:18,623
[SPEAKER_06]: This is somewhat a bit of a follow-up to the article we were talking about last week.

814
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:34,611
[SPEAKER_06]: The AMA is going to be having this meeting, and it already started in Chicago, and the council is going to be asking the group to lobby for the disorder to be included in a widely used mental illness manual created and published by the American Psychiatric Association, Video Game Addiction.

815
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:40,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if this were actually happening, this could mean that possibly your insurance company

816
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:44,234
[SPEAKER_06]: would cover this as any other type of mental disorder like alcoholism.

817
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:12,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ask me how I know so much about insurance, but I do.

818
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:19,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Insurance companies don't cover marijuana because it's not a federally recognized drug.

819
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:21,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only recognized in certain states.

820
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:24,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So your insurance company typically won't cover marijuana.

821
01:00:24,842 --> 01:00:26,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can get a prescription for it.

822
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:27,722
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, in certain states.

823
01:00:27,882 --> 01:00:30,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and there's only certain farms that are allowed to grow it.

824
01:00:30,903 --> 01:00:34,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, how did we get from video game diagnosis story to pot growing?

825
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:37,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we give our listeners what they want to know.

826
01:00:37,284 --> 01:00:37,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

827
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:42,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, from the story here, I want to point this out.

828
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:48,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Joyce Protopapas of Frisco, Texas said her 17-year-old son, Michael, was a video game addict.

829
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:49,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the story says a video addict.

830
01:00:50,568 --> 01:01:03,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Over nearly two years, video and internet games transformed him from an outgoing, academically gifted team into a reclusive manipulator who flunked two 10th grade classes and spent several hours a day and night playing a popular online video game called World of Warcraft.

831
01:01:04,013 --> 01:01:08,537
[SPEAKER_06]: My father was an alcoholic and I saw exactly the same thing in Michael, said Protopappas.

832
01:01:08,977 --> 01:01:11,139
[SPEAKER_06]: We battled him until October of last year.

833
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,400
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to therapists.

834
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,701
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried taking the game away.

835
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:15,182
[SPEAKER_06]: He would threaten us physically.

836
01:01:15,262 --> 01:01:17,284
[SPEAKER_06]: He would curse and call us every name imaginable.

837
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,625
[SPEAKER_06]: It was as if he was possessed.

838
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:23,418
[SPEAKER_06]: and when she suggested the therapist that Michael had a video game addiction nobody was familiar with it.

839
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:24,318
[SPEAKER_06]: They all poo-pooed it.

840
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:33,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally they found a therapist and they sent Michael to a therapeutic boarding school $5,000 a month that the insurance didn't cover to get him kicked off the video games.

841
01:01:33,865 --> 01:01:36,967
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what my mom would have done if I flunked a class over video games?

842
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:46,353
[SPEAKER_06]: She would have like thrown the TV out a window or she would have taken she actually did this once she took the power cord to the Nintendo so I couldn't hook it up to the TV for like

843
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm powerless to do anything about these video games

844
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking bullshit is what it is.

845
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:21,975
[SPEAKER_07]: She needs to get off her fucking drunken ass and take care of her damn kids is what she needs to do.

846
01:02:22,595 --> 01:02:24,136
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I don't know.

847
01:02:24,216 --> 01:02:27,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's stupid that she couldn't just take away the game system.

848
01:02:27,438 --> 01:02:28,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's a 14-year-old.

849
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:30,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Beat the crap out of him.

850
01:02:30,579 --> 01:02:31,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's easy.

851
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:39,704
[SPEAKER_06]: If she can't do it... I don't know if I would go that far, but... She should put him in one of those deprivation tanks.

852
01:02:39,764 --> 01:02:44,647
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like he had a lot of problems besides just video games and maybe he should have gone to the boarding school already.

853
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:45,899
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea.

854
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you, Rob.

855
01:02:48,461 --> 01:02:53,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, you know, other problems, and then because he's playing video games, obviously the video games are the problem.

856
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:55,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking hate people.

857
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:55,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

858
01:02:56,084 --> 01:02:58,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Jamie say she agreed with me?

859
01:02:59,795 --> 01:03:01,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob

860
01:03:25,293 --> 01:03:27,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, all of our Eddie Izzard fans, I bought jammy Dodgers.

861
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you Dodger that jammy when I shove it up your ass?

862
01:03:31,428 --> 01:03:34,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Then fine, you don't get any of the stuff I bought for Part B.

863
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:39,831
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I want the stuff you brought from Part B. I know, the stuff I brought from Part B is great.

864
01:03:39,971 --> 01:03:45,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So, some news comes from apparently a... Oh wait, I'm sorry, can I read chat comments?

865
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:48,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was ignoring the chat and that was a big story, so I'm sorry.

866
01:03:48,739 --> 01:03:51,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I was too busy fighting with Jamie, I hope you all will understand.

867
01:03:52,682 --> 01:03:58,227
[SPEAKER_06]: RawSteelUT says, it's a symptom of a larger problem that is ignored because the video games are a scapegoat.

868
01:03:58,908 --> 01:04:01,530
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good word for what's going on there, scapegoat.

869
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:09,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold Banjo says, I have so much video game systems and stuff that I always have stuff to do when my parents take away something.

870
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:13,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe they need to lock you in a room with fluffy walls then.

871
01:04:13,465 --> 01:04:13,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

872
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:16,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Blaze says, I don't buy this addiction thing.

873
01:04:16,288 --> 01:04:19,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Those types of doctors are the same that buy into the whole truth serum thing.

874
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:20,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Yikes.

875
01:04:21,332 --> 01:04:21,532
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

876
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:21,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

877
01:04:23,636 --> 01:04:35,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So, apparently, it was coming from a GameSpot forum poster that said they took part in a recent survey about an unannounced PlayStation Network episodic game called 9 to 5.

878
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:47,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the game is supposed to be kind of like an interactive sitcom where you're basically kissing the boss's butt to avoid being fired.

879
01:04:47,627 --> 01:04:51,590
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, all sorts of weird stuff like that, kind of like The Office or something.

880
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:59,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, they're saying that it's supposed to have four episodes which introduce you to Megacorp, I guess a...

881
01:05:00,755 --> 01:05:01,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

882
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:30,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Written and I guess voice acted by people that have been on Comedy Central, Saturday Night Live, Daily Show, Chappelle's Show, Conan O'Brien, etc.

883
01:05:32,812 --> 01:05:33,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

884
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:38,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game's supposed to run about $5 for an episode or $14 for all four.

885
01:05:39,474 --> 01:05:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonder Dog Harold says 9 to 5 should be based on the movie.

886
01:05:43,615 --> 01:05:44,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yes!

887
01:05:46,296 --> 01:05:47,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Dolly Parton!

888
01:05:47,436 --> 01:05:48,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah!

889
01:05:49,562 --> 01:05:50,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Working 9 to 5.

890
01:05:52,064 --> 01:05:54,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost watched that the other night because I was feeling a little gay.

891
01:05:54,926 --> 01:05:56,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is Pride weekend after all.

892
01:05:56,687 --> 01:05:59,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So I felt like I had to do something really gay this weekend.

893
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So I almost watched 9 to 5 last night.

894
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:03,671
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I opted to go to bed instead.

895
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:10,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do any Pride festivities this weekend because I'm not into that whole parade and running around shirtless thing.

896
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

897
01:06:12,037 --> 01:06:12,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my thing.

898
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:16,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's go on to the next story.

899
01:06:18,297 --> 01:06:19,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Next story.

900
01:06:19,538 --> 01:06:28,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for all of us who are fans of Hudson Soft, Rising Star Games has a deal to bring seven titles to Europe.

901
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:36,086
[SPEAKER_02]: This is taking place between September and March 2008 for PSPDS and Wii.

902
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:41,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not really a list of what those are, except for possibly Harvest Moon and Rainbow Islands.

903
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:44,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman!

904
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:53,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so, hooray, another Harvest Moon game on the Wii.

905
01:06:53,682 --> 01:06:54,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that really a surprise to anybody?

906
01:06:56,283 --> 01:06:56,543
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

907
01:06:57,164 --> 01:06:58,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Chirp, chirp, chirp.

908
01:06:58,104 --> 01:07:06,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, there's like two more Harvest Moon games coming out this summer on PSP and DS.

909
01:07:07,568 --> 01:07:09,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Shock and awe, I'm so surprised.

910
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:10,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what, they're all the same!

911
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:12,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're still not as good as Animal Crossing.

912
01:07:14,807 --> 01:07:16,989
[SPEAKER_07]: All the fucking same, and you people still buy them.

913
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:46,137
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's going on here is that Sony, who is the director of PlayStation Network Operations, Eric Lempel, said that the PlayStation Network may not always be free.

914
01:07:46,877 --> 01:07:54,300
[SPEAKER_06]: He said basically that the PlayStation Network's only real difference over Xbox Live is the price, which, you know, interesting.

915
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:58,882
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, of course, then this other exec kind of stepped in and then said, well, it may not always be free.

916
01:07:58,962 --> 01:08:00,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of interesting.

917
01:08:01,212 --> 01:08:29,789
[SPEAKER_06]: and I wouldn't say that's the only difference between the two well yeah that and the Xbox Live Marketplace has a lot of content whereas the PlayStation Network as I understand it has very little content now granted PlayStation Network has some very good content like that Tekken game good start and you know there's a lot of promising things about some of these originals they're making on PlayStation Network they look a heck of a lot more promising than some of the rehashed stuff we get on Xbox Live but you know is it going to be too little too late that's you know all I worry about so

918
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:36,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of something a little too late, Dead or Alive the movie.

919
01:08:37,215 --> 01:08:39,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Delayed forever and then finally came out.

920
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:41,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did it do?

921
01:08:41,537 --> 01:08:42,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it sucked.

922
01:08:43,538 --> 01:08:47,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It stinks, as Jay would say from the critic.

923
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:55,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently opened on 505 screens across the country and pulled in a whopping $232,000 worth.

924
01:08:58,001 --> 01:08:59,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is crappy.

925
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,482
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about $460 per screen.

926
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, that's atrocious.

927
01:09:03,842 --> 01:09:06,583
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like what movies at discount theaters make.

928
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:10,004
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when a movie is almost on video, what it's supposed to make.

929
01:09:10,124 --> 01:09:12,164
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really bad.

930
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:13,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that because piracy ruined it?

931
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:18,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that because... I never saw a single ad for this game outside of the internet anywhere.

932
01:09:19,266 --> 01:09:20,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just lack of promotion?

933
01:09:20,766 --> 01:09:25,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Lack of promotion, but it also opened up against... What the hell did it open up against?

934
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that was a lot better than it was

935
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:43,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want to see it.

936
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:43,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

937
01:09:59,335 --> 01:10:01,457
[SPEAKER_06]: RawSteelUT says, Sky, it's because it sucked.

938
01:10:01,977 --> 01:10:04,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what Sycoon says too, it's because it fucking sucked.

939
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:09,283
[SPEAKER_06]: The AfroGuy said, why isn't the Dead or Alive movie on DVD?

940
01:10:09,463 --> 01:10:11,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why didn't it go straight to DVD?

941
01:10:12,385 --> 01:10:13,186
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question.

942
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:19,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I don't know, you used to do, before you were doing games distribution, you did movie distribution, so any insight on that?

943
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:21,512
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of movies tend to go directly to DVD?

944
01:10:23,634 --> 01:10:23,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

945
01:10:25,194 --> 01:10:27,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides the Disney sequels like Cinderella 3.

946
01:10:28,496 --> 01:10:30,958
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of Disney sequels that go straight to DVD.

947
01:10:31,639 --> 01:10:37,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually movies that they don't want to spend money on advertising because it costs a lot of money to advertise a movie.

948
01:10:37,402 --> 01:10:42,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they feel it's not going to do that well in theaters, they'll release it straight to DVD.

949
01:10:43,547 --> 01:10:44,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's a whole set of...

950
01:10:47,967 --> 01:10:48,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Gobots!

951
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:12,882
[SPEAKER_07]: and also they have, was it Snakes on a Train?

952
01:11:13,282 --> 01:11:13,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff like that.

953
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:14,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of that goes through.

954
01:11:14,924 --> 01:11:16,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Cheese just said that, Snakes on a Train.

955
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:17,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

956
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:22,570
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, what was that movie we all watched, Cheerleading Ninjas or whatever that was?

957
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:23,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheerleader Ninjas.

958
01:11:23,351 --> 01:11:24,412
[SPEAKER_06]: That movie was incredible.

959
01:11:24,452 --> 01:11:26,073
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not.

960
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:28,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some good ones, though.

961
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:29,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some good ones that are coming out.

962
01:11:31,017 --> 01:11:33,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Dead Clowns about zombie clowns?

963
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:34,581
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be cool.

964
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, is it Clowns from Outer Space?

965
01:11:37,864 --> 01:11:39,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Killer Clowns from Outer Space, that's going to be awesome.

966
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:42,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that already came out years ago, and it sucked.

967
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:43,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, and it was awesome.

968
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:45,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have a whole clown horror night.

969
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:52,636
[SPEAKER_06]: People are raving about the DVD sequels in chat, even though this isn't game-related.

970
01:11:53,056 --> 01:11:53,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it is a little bit.

971
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,039
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, I mean, really, Bambi 2, WTF?

972
01:11:57,059 --> 01:11:59,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, what the hell, Bambi 2?

973
01:12:00,022 --> 01:12:01,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Bambi 2, my mom is still dead.

974
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:05,346
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Bambi 2, Bambi was grown up, and it's his kids now, so...

975
01:12:06,414 --> 01:12:07,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that makes it okay.

976
01:12:07,314 --> 01:12:08,315
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big Disney cop-out.

977
01:12:08,815 --> 01:12:15,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the only Bambi 2 I was ever interested in was there was Godzilla vs. Bambi, and then Godzilla vs. Bambi 2, Bambi's Revenge.

978
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:20,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Godzilla vs. Bambi was just... Alone in the Dark 2.

979
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,742
[SPEAKER_06]: The Afro guy says, isn't there a Lion King 4?

980
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:29,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's a Lion King 4, but if I remember right, there was a Lion King, like, two and a half.

981
01:12:29,685 --> 01:12:30,225
[SPEAKER_06]: One and a half.

982
01:12:30,845 --> 01:12:34,947
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of these movies, I don't know if it was one and a half or Lion King 3, one of these movies was...

983
01:12:36,108 --> 01:12:37,309
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

984
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:03,141
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there's a lot that goes straight to DVD.

985
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:05,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just look at your video store.

986
01:13:05,323 --> 01:13:07,165
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not Dead or Alive?

987
01:13:07,205 --> 01:13:08,767
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a prime candidate to go straight to DVD.

988
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:15,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to go straight to DVD at one time, but they decided, hey, we're going to release it to the theaters because people are going to go see it.

989
01:13:15,703 --> 01:13:16,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, were they wrong.

990
01:13:16,824 --> 01:13:19,546
[SPEAKER_06]: But how much money does it cost to put a movie in theaters?

991
01:13:19,906 --> 01:13:22,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they didn't spend any money on promotion, did they really lose anything?

992
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:23,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a whole lot.

993
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:25,089
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably wouldn't lose anything.

994
01:13:25,229 --> 01:13:30,073
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually probably would help the film a little bit, especially if they leave it in there long enough to do a few million dollars.

995
01:13:30,193 --> 01:13:32,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they'll be able to get that one critic.

996
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:36,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the thing about putting your movie in theaters is that the critics will review it.

997
01:13:37,077 --> 01:13:45,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll get that one critic who will give the movie an amazing review just because he wants to have his name in all the papers and the advertisement.

998
01:13:46,246 --> 01:13:51,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Dead or Alive is a, what's a quote you could say?

999
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy action thriller!

1000
01:13:52,572 --> 01:13:57,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead or Alive is a very tantalizing action movie, you know?

1001
01:13:58,697 --> 01:13:59,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sucks.

1002
01:13:59,318 --> 01:14:01,640
[SPEAKER_06]: But they wouldn't say that, you know, they'd leave that part out.

1003
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dot dot dot.

1004
01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:19,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy Action If you were to call this movie Great and Awesome you would be horribly wrong Great and Awesome DJ Morpheus in chat room makes a local joke Those of you folks from Sacramento will love this joke And it's always Mark S. Allen

1005
01:14:23,969 --> 01:14:30,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw says there's a Starship Troopers 3 in the works that's going straight to video and Casper Van Dien is reprising the role he did in the first movie.

1006
01:14:30,974 --> 01:14:33,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because Casper Van Dien hasn't really done anything in the series.

1007
01:14:33,596 --> 01:14:35,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he has done a lot of things.

1008
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:35,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Has he?

1009
01:14:35,377 --> 01:14:36,598
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all straight to DVD.

1010
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:38,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a heck of a career.

1011
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,963
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people that, that's how you know they've kind of lost it.

1012
01:14:44,783 --> 01:14:49,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Jean-Claude Van Damme and fucking Steven Seagal, man?

1013
01:14:49,086 --> 01:14:50,227
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still making stuff.

1014
01:14:51,067 --> 01:14:51,767
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of things.

1015
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,788
[SPEAKER_07]: People actually buy that shit up.

1016
01:14:54,008 --> 01:14:56,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with Chuck Norris, dude.

1017
01:14:56,649 --> 01:14:57,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Chuck Norris hasn't made too much.

1018
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:02,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I still say they need to do Chuck Norris versus the world, you know, because I would say that.

1019
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I say Freddy versus Jason versus Walker, Texas Ranger.

1020
01:15:05,472 --> 01:15:06,012
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?

1021
01:15:07,673 --> 01:15:10,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Chuck Norris versus Michael Myers.

1022
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:12,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we're crazy.

1023
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Versus the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

1024
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:15,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're crazy.

1025
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:16,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

1026
01:15:17,298 --> 01:15:23,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody also made a point much earlier, and I apologize because your comment scrolled way off the screen, but somebody said, porn goes direct to DVD.

1027
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:23,960
[SPEAKER_06]: All of it.

1028
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:24,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1029
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.

1030
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really keep tabs of the porno theaters around here.

1031
01:15:28,721 --> 01:15:30,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, theaters weren't really what they used to be for porn.

1032
01:15:31,721 --> 01:15:32,301
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know what I mean.

1033
01:15:34,102 --> 01:15:37,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew Nami would like to point out that Orange Lounge is not Baron's chat.

1034
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:39,223
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a World of Warcraft joke.

1035
01:15:40,183 --> 01:15:41,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, alright.

1036
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're going to bring this segment to a close here.

1037
01:15:43,624 --> 01:15:45,004
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to finish off Part A here.

1038
01:15:45,344 --> 01:15:45,724
[SPEAKER_06]: However...

1039
01:15:46,607 --> 01:15:51,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Part B is coming up, and we're actually going to put the news away tonight for Part B. We're all done with the news.

1040
01:15:52,413 --> 01:15:55,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I should ask real quick, Loki, do you have any last-minute things you want to add?

1041
01:15:55,957 --> 01:15:56,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know you had a few stories.

1042
01:15:57,378 --> 01:15:57,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1043
01:15:58,419 --> 01:15:59,040
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, go ahead.

1044
01:15:59,100 --> 01:15:59,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

1045
01:15:59,775 --> 01:16:01,056
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1046
01:16:19,714 --> 01:16:31,401
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that have listened every week, that have stuck with Orange Lounge Radio for the past five years, and really helped make this show what it is, and quite honestly, given us the motivation to continue to do this show.

1047
01:16:31,882 --> 01:16:38,686
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never really been about the number of people that are listening, because to put it in perspective, we don't talk about the number of people we have listen to our show very often.

1048
01:16:39,346 --> 01:16:41,287
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that's private information.

1049
01:16:41,728 --> 01:16:44,209
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our business, and we don't really need to brag.

1050
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:48,332
[SPEAKER_06]: But for real, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio had...

1051
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:49,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And I couldn't.

1052
01:17:01,438 --> 01:17:01,938
[SPEAKER_02]: and I couldn't.

1053
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:03,159
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, because you were in a weird place.

1054
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was in direct competition at the time of DDR Freak Radio.

1055
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:18,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can admit now, five years later, that a whole lot of this, this is the weirdest thing happened here is that Iguana Girl and I used to be BFF, but then we had like a major falling out and Iguana Girl and I didn't speak for like three years.

1056
01:17:18,524 --> 01:17:19,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, it was pretty dirty.

1057
01:17:20,405 --> 01:17:21,928
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1058
01:17:33,624 --> 01:17:34,865
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a peace treaty signature.

1059
01:17:35,045 --> 01:17:42,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, but the weirdest thing happened is that DDR Freak Radio started, like, and Orange Lounge Radio, like, both of us had the plans to do an online radio station.

1060
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:43,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say anything.

1061
01:17:43,832 --> 01:17:46,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and nobody, neither one of us kind of knew what the other was doing.

1062
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:47,094
And I knew on both ends.

1063
01:17:47,775 --> 01:17:49,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was just kind of weird the way that happened.

1064
01:17:49,496 --> 01:17:51,057
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, why did we bring that up?

1065
01:17:51,097 --> 01:17:58,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, because we, I tried to promote a lot on DDR Freak and some of the other, I can't remember if Bomani Style even existed at the time, but some of the other DDR sites.

1066
01:17:58,283 --> 01:17:59,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Bomani Style was around.

1067
01:17:59,023 --> 01:17:59,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they?

1068
01:17:59,404 --> 01:17:59,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1069
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:04,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the other sites that were around at that time, we tried to promote the show, and we had a whopping 15 listeners for the first episode.

1070
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:15,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And pretty much, honestly, guys, for about the first three years of Orange Lingerie, for about the first three years of Orange Lingerie, I would say we were lucky if we pulled 40 listeners in the third year.

1071
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just the way live radio is, boys and girls.

1072
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:24,143
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of folks don't – live through CC5 kind of limits us a little bit, and the fact that it's live –

1073
01:18:25,578 --> 01:18:29,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other people have better things to do Sunday night, which is understandable.

1074
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:33,803
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, podcasting, audio blogging, whatever you want to call it, it really opened doors for us.

1075
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:41,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we were really fortunate to jump on that train before it really took off when iTunes incorporated podcasting in June of 2005.

1076
01:18:42,248 --> 01:18:44,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was just really awesome for us.

1077
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:48,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And now our listenership is, I can say it's in the thousands.

1078
01:18:48,352 --> 01:18:50,253
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not talking like 9,000, more like 2,000 or 3,000 people that we have.

1079
01:18:50,273 --> 01:18:51,174
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the 4,000 a week.

1080
01:18:55,074 --> 01:18:56,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, but, you know, it doesn't... You know, whatever.

1081
01:18:57,255 --> 01:19:01,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just interesting that it's blown up so much thanks to this podcasting thing.

1082
01:19:01,576 --> 01:19:03,697
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me, really, not a lot's changed.

1083
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:07,958
[SPEAKER_06]: The motivation continues to be... Because we don't hear from all 4,000 of you.

1084
01:19:08,018 --> 01:19:11,019
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate the fact that you guys are listening to the show.

1085
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:12,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear God, not all 4,000 people email me.

1086
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,600
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate that you're listening.

1087
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should.

1088
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we don't... We can check the email.

1089
01:19:16,781 --> 01:19:17,161
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?

1090
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:18,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me say this, too.

1091
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:20,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to try to wrap this up because I don't want... But...

1092
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,511
[SPEAKER_06]: We speculate we have about 1,800 real actual people subscribing to the show.

1093
01:19:23,531 --> 01:19:24,432
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, that's regardless.

1094
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:39,370
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we don't hear from all those people on a real regular basis.

1095
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:40,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the chatters.

1096
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:41,292
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the callers.

1097
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:43,753
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the folks that send us emails.

1098
01:19:43,813 --> 01:19:47,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the people that reach out that really have kind of given us that motivation to keep going for the past five years.

1099
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:48,597
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's how I feel.

1100
01:19:48,677 --> 01:19:51,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you guys, but that's really been what it is.

1101
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:57,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I personally want to dedicate our success to the powers of the underworld.

1102
01:20:00,345 --> 01:20:02,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And that demonic pact you signed one day?

1103
01:20:03,127 --> 01:20:05,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they offended me, my soul.

1104
01:20:07,448 --> 01:20:08,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, anything you want to add?

1105
01:20:08,509 --> 01:20:08,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1106
01:20:09,169 --> 01:20:11,270
[SPEAKER_06]: What keeps you motivated week after week to do this program?

1107
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm motivated.

1108
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:14,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You're an asshole.

1109
01:20:14,691 --> 01:20:15,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm motivated.

1110
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:19,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on my live journal, it says I'm motivated by spite and porn.

1111
01:20:20,314 --> 01:20:23,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm motivated by my non-video game addiction.

1112
01:20:23,996 --> 01:20:25,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like turns!

1113
01:20:25,117 --> 01:20:25,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad.

1114
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:55,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be back, and who knows what could happen.

1115
01:20:55,443 --> 01:20:58,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a very interesting Part B on this, our five-year anniversary.

1116
01:20:58,205 --> 01:21:01,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and supporting Independent Radio.

1117
01:21:01,847 --> 01:21:03,788
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome, and you're the reason we're here.

1118
01:21:04,089 --> 01:21:05,350
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back after this with more.

1119
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:11,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1120
01:21:11,654 --> 01:21:15,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
