00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Today, June 24th, 2007, our introduction takes a little trip down memory lane.

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:30,400
Hey, where are we going?

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:59,360
The Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:11,600
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:22,480
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,760
that are evil.

7
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,640
So you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,200
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

9
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
demons from hell.

10
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, wait.

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Most children already are evil little demons from hell.

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:49,840
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,880
In fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,560
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,120
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Samburgers!

17
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,480
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
That was huge.

19
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Cool.

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,480
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
Yeah, that's right.

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,480
The only thing you're going to be riding is me.

23
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Have you seen Malcolm?

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Lena?

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,600
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
So it was you.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,840
I was going to expose you.

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
I know.

29
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,480
So I choose to expose myself.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
Please, there are ladies present.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,480
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,480
Dark Sakura.

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,640
Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
Sky.

35
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Anytime, anyplace, baby.

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Loki.

37
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Ow, my foot!

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,800
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Orange Lounge Radio.

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,120
We are live on this June the 24th of 2007.

41
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,240
Good god that was a bloated ass intro.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,480
That was actually, that was one of our old intros.

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,600
That intro's like two minutes long.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,320
Go figure.

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,040
We actually used that for like a year.

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,960
Anyway, hi and welcome to that show dedicated not just to Bomani now but after several years

47
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,120
on the air we evolved to talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
My name is Rob Roberts.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,040
Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Hi.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,880
Five years, and that's all you have to say is, ah.

52
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Hi.

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,520
That's how I'd sum it up too, really.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,920
And also say hello, as always, to Tech Master Loki.

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
Hello.

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
How you doing, Loki?

57
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm doing fine.

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
All right.

59
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Sounds good.

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Well, there you have it.

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,200
It's just the three of us tonight because tonight is a special night.

62
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,600
It is our fifth anniversary show, and hello to those of you in our chat room, the always

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,920
present fourth guest in our program, chat.orangelaungerator.com, the biggest our chat room has ever been.

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,200
Thank you guys so much, and a big thank you to allgames.com as well, who's simulcasting

65
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,720
our live broadcast tonight to accommodate everybody that wanted to listen to us live.

66
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
That's so awesome.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,720
Anyway, here we are all these years later, and we're still talking about the latest and

68
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,880
what's going on in the news and gaming culture, but most importantly, us.

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,800
We start the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, so let's kick it over

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
to Dark Sakura.

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
How was your gaming week?

72
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,480
I played World of Warcraft.

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
You were there.

74
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,840
I was there.

75
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,480
And then I signed off to go talk to people because I like living.

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,120
Wait, you mean you signed off for real life?

77
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Sort of.

78
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
That's no fun.

79
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I've been working overtime all week, so.

80
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Ew, that's no fun at all.

81
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
Money is good.

82
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Money is good.

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah.

84
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
Appreciate that.

85
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
All right.

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Say hello as well to Loki, and how was your gaming week?

87
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,200
I played a bunch of things, actually.

88
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:50,780
I tried WTF, or Work Time Fun, I guess, for the PSB.

89
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,920
It's pretty awesome.

90
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
It's a little weird.

91
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,640
A lot of the games are very mundane.

92
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,680
It's just working, like one of them that you put caps on pens.

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
That's it.

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,240
There's another one that's pretty funny, though, where you are a drunken mayor and you have

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,440
to stumble your way over to a ribbon to cut it.

96
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:16,680
So you basically earn money to use in these little gumball vending machines to get little

97
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,960
trinkets and useless crap.

98
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,260
And that's the whole game.

99
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,600
So that's kind of interesting.

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,220
The other game I played this week was Hot Pixel for the PSP, thanks to somebody leaking

101
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,600
it on the internet.

102
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,120
And thank God they leaked it on the internet, because I would not have wanted to buy this

103
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
game.

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,200
It was horrible.

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,760
It's short, for one.

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,560
I mean, I beat the game under an hour, so that's pretty bad.

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,720
The second thing is, the guy behind it, this French guy who does this podcast, I believe

108
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,440
it's called Street Smart Cool Cat, he's a fucking retard.

109
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,600
I fucking hate him.

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,440
I hate him even more after playing this game.

111
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,800
He is a complete douche.

112
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,840
He is, like, the beginning of each level that you play, he's doing something stupid to make

113
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,220
himself look really cool, and he's not.

114
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,740
He's like a cross between fucking Bill Nye the Science Guy and Screech, except not smart

115
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,960
and nerdier.

116
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,800
Then I also played, let's see, Transformers, the game on the PSP.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,920
Thank God I'm not buying the PSP one, although I will be playing the 361 later this week.

118
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,160
I just wanted to see what the PSP one looked like, and it's not very good.

119
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,600
But if you only have a PSP, then, I don't know, maybe it's worth picking up.

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,760
Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, I actually played some of the single player part of that,

121
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,160
so that was kind of interesting.

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
Pretty good storyline so far.

123
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,520
Of course, multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, and, let's see, off of

124
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,880
the PSP, I also played Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link.

125
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Still hate that game, but I'm still playing it.

126
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,600
Earth Defense Force 2, I actually tried that on the PlayStation 2.

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
It's interesting.

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,920
I don't like the controls too much.

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm not sure if there's a way to configure it so it's exactly like the Xbox 360, because

130
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,840
I think that would really help, because right now, the way they have it set up, your look

131
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,320
and movement are the same analog six, so that kind of sucks.

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,600
But otherwise, it looks pretty cool.

133
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,040
You get the Destroy Big Ben in the first level.

134
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Let's see, what else?

135
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Oh, I also played, of course, more Earth Defense Force 2017.

136
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,480
Finished the game on hard now, and now we're going through hardest and Inferno.

137
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,280
It's about time you beat that damn game, because I swear, for like the past ten weeks I've

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,680
beat the game on easy, normal, and now hard.

139
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,820
It's just I have to play through it all the time until we get the genocide gun.

140
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,240
Is this something about trying to get all 1000 achievement points?

141
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,320
Well, I just want the genocide gun, and unfortunately I have to beat the whole game.

142
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,920
The genocide gun.

143
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,560
Does a million damage per shot, and blows up everything.

144
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,040
And then, yeah, that's actually I think about it for the week.

145
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,840
All right, well you've got a lot of playing done.

146
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,400
I had a pretty mellow gaming week, kind of like Dark Sakura.

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,360
I pretty much spent all my time on World of Warcraft, because I'm a sad, sad little addict,

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,560
but I reached a real milestone in World of Warcraft this week.

149
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,440
I hit level 60 today, hooray, which now is kind of dwarfed by the fact that you can actually

150
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,960
go to 70 in Burning Crusade, so I'm just waiting for the people in chat to go, I'm level 70.

151
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,240
But I still think 60 is kind of a bit of a landmark, and just goes to show you what a

152
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
sad little addict I really am.

153
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,180
But our guild is really growing on there, and it's been a lot of fun, and we have Ventrilo

154
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,320
and all that fun stuff, so it's a fun time waster.

155
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,600
Other than that, not a whole lot.

156
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,240
I checked out the new Xbox Live Arcade titled the Band of Bugs game, did you check that

157
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
out at all?

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
No.

159
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,640
I know usually you check out the arcade releases.

160
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,360
It's kind of like a Final Fantasy Tactics-ish game, it's your tactical type of game.

161
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
That I definitely won't be playing it.

162
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,640
Yeah, I know, it's not really, well I don't know, because I really dug Final Fantasy Tactics,

163
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,960
but I didn't play enough of Band of Bugs to give it a fair review, I didn't even purchase

164
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,880
the retail one, but I did check it out, and it was a little bit of my gaming week, and

165
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,120
I was like, oh, I don't know if I could, it was kind of one of those things where I'm

166
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,400
playing so much freaking WoW that I don't really have time for another tactical game.

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,080
So much for that.

168
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,040
However, I did also, I got onto GameTap for some strange reason, I decided, oh, I'm paying

169
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,520
for this, I should probably check it out again, and I just started, I had like a marathon

170
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,040
the other day, I was playing all these old-school Atari 2600 games, like I was playing Kaboom

171
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,640
for like an hour and a half, it was kind of sad.

172
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
That's that game, like you remember on the old-school 2600 with the little paddle, except

173
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,800
now you use your mouse and you catch the bombs, like I don't know what it is, like some people

174
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,780
can sit there and play Bejeweled for hours, I was playing Kaboom.

175
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,480
And then I played Pitfall, the old-school Pitfall, and I'm a lot better at it now than

176
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,280
I was when I was seven, go figure.

177
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,640
So I actually played through quite a ways in the game.

178
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,840
And I like how GameTap is really taking a lot of good ideas from Xbox Live and incorporating

179
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,640
into their service, like now you have a profile page that shows the last games that you've

180
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,400
played, and all that stuff, where have I seen this before?

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,440
And then you have your leaderboards on the actual service itself, so pretty cool.

182
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,840
You know, hey, if it's a good idea, why not borrow it?

183
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,540
I was going to say rip it off, but I guess it would be borrow it.

184
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,640
So I do like how GameTap's growing, and it'll be interesting when it comes over to the Macs,

185
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,000
and more people that I know have been holding out on GameTap because it's not out on Mac,

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,560
will be able to come over.

187
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,600
So that was really it, otherwise a little bit of Puzzle Quest, and that was pretty much

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
it.

189
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I didn't play a lot of console games this week, funny enough.

190
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,400
I got Season 1 of Sam & Max, I haven't installed it yet though, but I'm planning on playing

191
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
it.

192
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm just kind of on the fritz right now, something's going out in it, because it randomly shuts

193
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,400
off completely, so I'm thinking either the power supply, hard drive, or motherboard's

194
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
going out.

195
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,000
Either way, I need to upgrade the damn thing.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,660
It's been like years.

197
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,080
Going to the chat room, the always present, chat.orangemanjr.com, always the fourth guest,

198
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,800
always has been for the past five years, always will be.

199
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,720
We'll start out with this lovely comment tonight, rostielut in chat says, Sky, god, stop sucking

200
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,140
GameTap's cock.

201
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,480
You know, you'd think I'm on their payroll or something, I swear to god I'm not.

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,520
I think it's just a pretty good thing.

203
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,080
It's relatively cheap, you get a lot of games, it's not a bad deal.

204
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,200
If I like something, I'm going to tell you I like it.

205
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
Talk about Xbox Live all the time, we're not in their payroll.

206
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I do, yeah.

207
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm not sucking their cock.

208
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
We're not in anybody's payroll, which sucks.

209
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,240
I kind of wish I was getting some nookie from all these people, that would be a lot of fun.

210
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,800
I want them to hire me to rub them while they're naked.

211
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,480
You want to give a little massage loving to GameTap?

212
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,840
Dude, I would love to go to the video game companies and be their massage therapist.

213
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,480
Would you give out some happy endings?

214
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,440
Would you give Reggie a happy ending?

215
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,520
Rob, I don't think that's funny.

216
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,360
Oh, and black boy in the chat room says, Loki should buy a new MacBook.

217
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,040
That's funny, because see, the next computer I'm buying, my benchmark is it's going to

218
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,760
be able to run Crysis very well.

219
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,440
Unfortunately, a MacBook would just explode by, I don't know, even thinking about running

220
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Crysis.

221
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
No.

222
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Ah, let's see.

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,640
What wasn't so negative that was said in chat here that we could also read?

224
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,560
Hitstun says, I like GameTap so far, but I don't have the disk space or clock speed for

225
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
any of the newer stuff.

226
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Fair enough.

227
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,800
I suppose my computer, I replaced my computer about a year and a half ago, so it's a little

228
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,960
bit newer, so it can run some of these more higher end stuff.

229
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,680
And some folks who haven't replaced their computer in a few years are probably struggling

230
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
a little more.

231
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,680
I'm in the process of rebuilding.

232
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,960
Well, not necessarily rebuilding, but I'm adding in stuff to the one that was given

233
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
to me.

234
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
All right.

235
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Cool.

236
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,880
Yeah, I like to build my own computer as opposed to having the whole Dell-in-a-box type thing.

237
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,560
I re-downloaded MAME today, and along with it, of course, the first ROMs I re-downloaded

238
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,400
were all the Gals Panic series.

239
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Good job.

240
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,220
How about Miss World 96?

241
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,960
I think I might have grabbed that, just because I knew you would laugh.

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,280
What I was trying to do was install Guitar Freak's 5th Mix on my laptop to be able to

243
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,360
play with the Guitar Hero controller, unfortunately 5th Mix at the moment I don't think is compatible

244
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
with MAME.

245
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I don't know.

246
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,700
They also have 3rd Korean on there, which I thought was kind of funny.

247
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,680
They actually have DDR games playable in MAME?

248
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I never knew that.

249
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Yeah.

250
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
It's kind of weird.

251
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,640
I don't think they're playable well, like audio problems, but I don't know.

252
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,400
Have they actually enabled the new Capcom board?

253
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,000
I remember last week we reported Street Fighter 3 and stuff, so that's now in there?

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,440
Yes, I think so.

255
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,000
I remember seeing some.

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,680
I want to see the Sega boards emulated, because I want Planet Harrier.

257
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,760
You know, I sometimes will go without playing MAME for a long time, and then I go back and

258
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,040
I kind of check on it, and they have all this crazy stuff playable.

259
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Planet Harrier.

260
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
It might be there.

261
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
You should check.

262
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
I don't know.

263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
We haven't been able to emulate the board.

264
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Don't.

265
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Does anybody in chat room know if they're ever going to get that?

266
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Who knows?

267
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
All right.

268
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
Well, that was our gaming week.

269
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Let's get on to some other stuff before we get into the news, like some housekeeping.

270
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,920
We just wanted to say tonight, of course, it's our fifth anniversary show.

271
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,040
Not a whole lot.

272
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,480
I don't know.

273
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,120
I don't know how you guys feel, but I wasn't really all about tooting our own horns tonight.

274
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,840
This is more like fan service for the listeners tonight with the different intro and the fact

275
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,780
that we are dedicating all of Part B tonight to our listeners, so we're going to invite

276
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,640
you guys later on to call in, chat with us, just talk about what's going on in gaming,

277
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,100
and that'll be that.

278
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,480
That's kind of our special plan for the fifth anniversary show.

279
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:48,680
No A-list celebrities, no surprise major gaming celebrity guests or anything like that, but

280
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
you never know.

281
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
I don't know.

282
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,360
I tried to send email to some people that do other shows and stuff, like, hey, we're

283
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
going to be taking calls.

284
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Who knows?

285
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,920
We might get surprises as folks might call in.

286
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,720
That would be pretty rad, so we'll see what happens.

287
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,680
Anyhow, let's get onto the gaming news, because we do it every week.

288
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
We do it every other week, so why not?

289
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
We'll talk about it this week as well.

290
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,140
Of course, unless you've been living in a cave in the gaming world this week, you probably

291
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,680
have heard about this, but Manhunt 2, controversy, controversy, controversy, okay, God, how do

292
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
I sum this all up?

293
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,500
I realize most people have probably read this all online already, so how do I sum this up?

294
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:31,520
The game was effectively banned in Britain, not so much that they banned it, but basically

295
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,240
they said, we're not going to rate it, and when the game doesn't have a rating, then

296
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,680
you can't sell it.

297
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,520
In a roundabout way, it was banned, if that makes sense.

298
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,680
They're not going to be able to sell this game in Britain.

299
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,040
Then people are saying, oh, well, this game is so horrible.

300
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,880
They should rate it AO in America, and it turns out, oh, the game has been rated AO

301
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,120
here in America, adults only, which is a rating that's been reserved for very, very few games,

302
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,280
lots of very under the radar type of sex games have gotten this type of rating.

303
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
All on PC, by the way.

304
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Yeah, they're all PC.

305
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,160
Well, because, and then the next part of this was, if the game has continued to stay rated

306
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,240
AO, the Nintendo will not endorse it, Sony will not endorse it, and Microsoft will not

307
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
allow it.

308
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Which is fucked up.

309
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
They will all not allow the product to come out on the systems.

310
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
That's fucked up.

311
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,420
Okay, here's the first place, or here's the first question I'm going to ask, and maybe

312
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,080
somebody's already asked this, I don't know if you know the answer.

313
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,040
What about a Renegade release?

314
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,620
Because I remember back in the day, I remember on Nintendo, like there were companies that

315
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,060
would make games without the official Nintendo seal of equality, like Color Dreams, remember

316
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,120
those like ugly-ass blue cartridges and the really horrible games that came out from them?

317
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Like they could do it, but I'm thinking maybe it's because Take-Two is a big, big publisher,

318
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
they don't want to burn their bridges.

319
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,880
Well, not only that, but I mean, they could still release everything Renegade or whatever,

320
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,240
but I think now that they actually do have to get everything licensed in order to be

321
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,120
able to actually press this, that's why everything has to go through certification before it

322
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,800
can actually go gold and get this press on it, so I don't know.

323
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,440
I don't know why they, I wish, the whole thing between AO and mature-retarded anyways, because

324
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,320
what you're saying is this game is not suitable for 17-year-olds, which I don't know, hostile

325
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,360
too out there, it's all about torture and people's limbs getting chopped off and like

326
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
rape and stuff.

327
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Naked chicks dancing in blood.

328
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,320
And naked chicks dancing in blood, and that's a suitable for 17-year-olds, but oh, a pixelated

329
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,880
video game, oh okay, well that's way, 17-year-olds go, oh wait, this is teaching me how to commit

330
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,080
murder, okay, I'm going to go murder somebody now, come on, I mean seriously, grow the fuck

331
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,520
up, and they're all, well this is to keep it out of our children's hands.

332
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,600
It's not supposed to be in children's hands, it's fucking 17 and over.

333
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,720
Quick comments from chat room, let's see, Corey 31 says, but no stores will sell it,

334
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
that's the main problem.

335
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Oh, but it will.

336
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,600
Like, Sylvara follows up, Walmart, Target, Blockbuster wouldn't sell it.

337
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,640
Who cares, that's a selling point for the independents.

338
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Internet!

339
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,400
No, independent stores would carry that shit, in fact, when they heard that it was going

340
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,480
to be adults only, and that Blockbuster, Gamefly, and Walmart weren't going to be carrying it,

341
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,960
they're like, I'll double my order, you know, so that shit would still sell, it may not

342
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,120
sell as fast, but it would still sell.

343
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,400
Here's a comment from Take Two.

344
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,280
This actually comes from, I'm not sure who at Take Two, this is a general comment from

345
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,640
Take Two, quote, the ESRB has issued an initial rating of AO, adults only, for Manhunt 2.

346
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,760
Oh, this is an actual statement they made.

347
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,440
We believe the process of rating video games is to help people make informed entertainment

348
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,280
choices and not to limit them.

349
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,600
Manhunt 2 is created for mature audiences and we strongly believe it should receive

350
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,880
an M rating, aligning it with similar content created in other forms of media.

351
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,400
We are exploring other options with regards to Manhunt 2.

352
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,680
Yeah, and I do think that they're unfairly being targeted.

353
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:01,680
It's always, you know, Take Two is always the target of both advocates for like, you

354
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,840
know, family games and stuff like that.

355
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,960
Here's the thing though, I mean, from what I've heard about this game, and granted, I've

356
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,560
never played the original Manhunt, it wasn't really on my radar, I never played it.

357
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,800
Although, I have to admit, when I heard that this game was coming out for the Wii, I was

358
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,080
very interested, because yes, there is a sadistic side of me that thinks it would be kind of

359
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,720
fun to chop people up in many gruesome ways with the Wiimote and the nunchuck.

360
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,440
Come on, you all were thinking it, right?

361
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,340
You already had it pre-ordered.

362
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,400
Who wasn't like Dark Soccer, weren't you looking forward to taking out your aggressions with

363
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,200
the Wii, like chainsaw people's faces off or whatever you can do in the game?

364
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,760
I don't know, I'm making stuff up.

365
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
No.

366
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
No?

367
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,320
I didn't really care about this game, I didn't like the first one.

368
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,160
Oh, you actually played the first one?

369
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,640
Yeah, I had it on Dreamcast.

370
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Oh, how was it?

371
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Kind of crappy?

372
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
Oh, okay.

373
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,080
Well, Dan liked it.

374
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,880
It was an okay game, it just wasn't my type of game, so I didn't...

375
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Was it on Dreamcast?

376
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,240
Yeah, it only came out in Europe.

377
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,720
I didn't give two shits about it, so...

378
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Alright, well fair enough.

379
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Okay, so...

380
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,240
So, I mean, I'm the wrong person to ask.

381
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Alright, fine.

382
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,880
So you didn't give a shit about the game, and so Loki and I, I'm assuming you never

383
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
played the first Manhunt.

384
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,080
I never really played the first Manhunt.

385
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,680
I've got it on PlayStation, PS2, if you ever want to borrow it.

386
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
No, I could have that too.

387
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,480
It doesn't have the Wii-mote.

388
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,400
I can't actually pretend I am chopping wieners off and whatever.

389
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,400
I can slice people across their abdomen in Trauma Center and that's rewarding.

390
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,840
Okay, good point.

391
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,320
Okay, here's the thing.

392
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Here's the thing.

393
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,800
Okay, so it's rated AO for the Wii, because you're simulating murder in that.

394
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,860
Why is the PlayStation 2 unrated AO as well?

395
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,260
That makes no sense to me.

396
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,680
You're not simulating murder with the Wii-mote, so that factors out of it, and that was their

397
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,700
reasoning behind it, saying, oh, this is why it deserves an AO rating instead of mature.

398
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,520
So now you're just kind of went completely against that and said, oh, well, actually

399
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,960
because we hate Take-Two and Rockstar, and we want to make an example of them.

400
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,440
That's what it really is.

401
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
Chat comments.

402
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,160
We have a shitload of people in chat tonight.

403
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,960
Thank you guys for making our chat room a huge success tonight.

404
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
Morrie says, would this have been made into as much of a big deal if it was being developed

405
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,000
by someone besides Take-Two who didn't have to deal with the whole hot coffee thing?

406
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,120
I say yes, because I don't think this has anything to do with Take-Two, but the gaming

407
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,160
industry in general, personally.

408
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,400
I think it does have to do with Take-Two.

409
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Look at it.

410
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Look at Bully.

411
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Look at Manhunt 2.

412
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,800
People were protesting that game before they even saw screenshots of it.

413
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,640
After applied to Black Devil RX, necks can have orifices if you have a tracheotomy or

414
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,720
you cut someone's head off.

415
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,080
What was the comment?

416
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,240
There was a comment about neck rape on there.

417
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh, interesting.

418
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,080
I also want to read another comment from Black Devil RX.

419
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,680
Adults only is a stupid rating.

420
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,840
There's no need for it.

421
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,600
It should be more like an NC-17 thing, because right now they're saying that adults aren't

422
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
mature, which is the rating below AO.

423
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,480
That's my whole problem with it, is that I actually don't have a problem with this game

424
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,600
being rated AO.

425
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,200
It probably should be, as should some other games that are out there on the market that

426
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,400
came out with an M rating.

427
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,300
I don't have a problem with these games being rated AO.

428
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
They are for adults only.

429
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Kids should not be playing these games.

430
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,200
I have a problem with society's response to the AO rating.

431
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,160
It's the same thing with the NC-17 rating.

432
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,560
The NC-17 rating in movies is like the kiss of death, whereas personally, if I had a kid,

433
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,020
I would much rather they see a movie like Showgirls that has a little nudity and sex

434
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:28,080
in it than a movie like Hostel or Hostel Part 2, which had a lower rating.

435
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,880
It's just a little sex, but then again, that might not be a fair comparison, because we're

436
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,860
talking about sex versus violence.

437
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
We're here with Manhunt.

438
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
It's all violence.

439
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,240
Well, it's just like with a lot of the ratings on these games and stuff, Grand Theft Auto.

440
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
There's a perfect example.

441
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,240
San Andreas.

442
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,200
That game had a bunch of murdering and killing of people and stuff, but oh my god, show a

443
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,980
little bit of digital booby and boom, AO.

444
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,360
See double fucking standards right there.

445
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
I don't even know what the problem is with these people.

446
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,840
Okay, granted, it is an adult-only game, and mature I would think pretty much satisfies

447
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,680
that, because 17 and older, 18 and older, I think between 17 and 18, for the most part,

448
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,960
people are maturing that much.

449
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,520
I think at 17, you probably know right and wrong about as much as you do when you're

450
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
18.

451
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,000
I think the dividing line of maturity is when you start paying your own bills.

452
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,400
That's actually a really good point.

453
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
That's a good point.

454
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
I know a lot of people in their 20s that live with mommy and daddy that aren't as mature

455
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
as some people I know that would be out at 17.

456
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,400
I don't understand why they don't just have M as the cap off for that, or you just leave

457
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
it at M.

458
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Here's the thing.

459
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,720
I don't want to drag this topic on too long, because it's been debated to death all week,

460
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,480
but I do want to get one other thought out here, and that would be about how, and I'm

461
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,200
getting a private message from Brad from Pod Culture saying, actually, games should use

462
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
the same rating system as movies that would make things easier to understand.

463
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
It's how they did in Europe.

464
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,520
I think to an extent that's what they kind of tried to do with the ESRB is I think they

465
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,080
tried to copy the movie ratings without copying them.

466
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,480
So I think an M rating is supposed to be like R, no one under 17 admitted without parent

467
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,960
or guardian, and same thing.

468
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,200
They would sell you a game as long as your mommy or daddy is there with you and the clerk

469
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,480
says what's in the game.

470
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,920
But AO is like NC17, no one under 17 admitted period, parents or not.

471
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,760
This is just not an acceptable thing.

472
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,640
That would be, I think, the thing with the AO rating.

473
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,800
This game is not sold to anyone over 18.

474
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
It's like cigarettes.

475
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
You do not sell it under any circumstances.

476
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,420
Well, it's just like the M-rated games.

477
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:39,600
Those are not intended to be played by kids that are under 17.

478
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,560
So it is, in a sense, like the NC17.

479
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,600
It's just people don't treat it that way and then until someone goes and murders somebody

480
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,720
then they're all, oh my God, it was the game's fault.

481
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,560
I had no idea.

482
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,200
All right.

483
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,480
Well I guess that's that.

484
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,140
If you'd like to comment on this, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com would be the place

485
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,040
to send those emails and we've got to move on though because there was actually other

486
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,820
stuff that happened in the gaming world this week.

487
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,700
It was hard to find it amongst all the Manhunt 2 news but there was some other stuff going

488
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
on, right, Loki?

489
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Yes.

490
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
In fact, some interesting stuff.

491
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,480
This has kind of been a trend with Microsoft right now, securing a lot of exclusive rights

492
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,000
of things, one of which being Grand Theft Auto 4 episodic content.

493
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,420
Apparently they've spent $50 million in securing this episodic content, which to me that seems

494
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:34,000
like an awful lot of money to spend to secure content for a game that's downloadable.

495
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,560
I would be very interested if there are some announcements at E3 or something.

496
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,800
I was thinking that maybe they're going to announce that it's going to be an Xbox 360

497
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,940
exclusive for the game because that's quite a bit of money that they're throwing at them,

498
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,980
but whatever, either way.

499
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,100
So if you own the 360, you're going to be able to download the episodic content in about

500
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,900
two batches, one of which is supposed to hit mid next year and then the rest at the end

501
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,340
of next year, so $25 million for each.

502
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,080
I think honestly though, I heard this broken down brilliantly.

503
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,480
I can't remember where I heard it.

504
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,440
I want to say our buddies at All Games Interactive, when I was listening to them on Monday waiting

505
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,920
to go on the air, I heard something like this and that would be that they're going to make

506
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,900
money on this, they're going to make a lot of money on this because Grand Theft Auto

507
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,800
4 will sell millions of copies.

508
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,960
Let's say they sell, what is it?

509
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,640
Let's say they sell 5 million copies of the game, at least, on Xbox 360.

510
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
They sell 5 million copies of the game and people are going to download this, let's say

511
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,340
they charge $10 for the episodic content, they're going to make their $50 million back

512
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
right there.

513
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,320
Now granted, I'm assuming that everybody's going to buy it, which isn't going to happen,

514
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,140
but I'm only considering one piece of downloadable content for $10.

515
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,280
If they release three pieces of downloadable content for $10, they'll more than make their

516
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,240
money back and then some.

517
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,080
Plus, they have something that Sony doesn't, which in the end might move some consoles

518
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,720
and so on and so on because I know people that are holding out for this game, Game 360.

519
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,560
Plus, gamer picks and themes and all sorts of crap that they can market using Grand Theft

520
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
Auto.

521
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
There you go.

522
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:16,520
You know what, to be honest, I'm not too surprised that they're actually doing this because the

523
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,680
PlayStation Network so far, downloadable content for games has been almost nonexistent.

524
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,800
Just to clear this up, because I'm still a little unsure on this, because I seem to remember

525
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,600
when this game was first announced, they said, okay, the PlayStation 3 is going to have this

526
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,000
downloadable content and the Xbox 360 will have this different downloadable content.

527
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,720
Microsoft is basically paid to stop the PlayStation 3 exclusive content from coming out at all.

528
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I think so.

529
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,160
Interesting.

530
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,640
I guess that's why they did it, to try and move some more systems and get people, because

531
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,200
the game will be that much more on the 360.

532
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
This isn't the first game that they were doing this.

533
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,640
In fact, now they're saying that a beautiful Katamari is going to be a 360 exclusive as

534
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
well.

535
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,600
No, who knows about that.

536
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,140
GS191 says something interesting, the three items for download, a gun, a car, and a sex

537
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,060
mini game.

538
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,980
It's not going to be stupid shit like that.

539
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,880
It's going to be actual episodic, brand new storylines and stuff like that.

540
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,760
Not like you get a brand new gun.

541
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,800
Black Boy says Take Two is actually talking about selling 10 million units by the end

542
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
of 2008.

543
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,120
I don't know amongst what systems, because you're going to have your Sony fanboys and

544
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,600
people that bought the PlayStation 3 over the Xbox 360 during last year's Christmas

545
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,120
craze that don't really give a shit about the downloadable content.

546
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,320
They just want the game and all that.

547
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,320
I think there's a chunk of that 10 million that's going to stay on Sony's side.

548
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
We shall see.

549
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:51,880
Well, speaking of downloadable content, Eidos UK has said that the Tomb Raider anniversary

550
00:28:51,880 --> 00:29:00,520
for Xbox 360 is going to be available as a series of downloads in conjunction with Tomb

551
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,960
Raider Legend.

552
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:12,240
Basically you're downloading each of them as different parts of the game, with free

553
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,920
downloads being Lara's Manor, all that type of stuff.

554
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,480
However, each of these episodes are going to be about $30 apiece, 2,400 Microsoft points.

555
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,280
I wouldn't suppose there will be a downloadable topless Lara patch like there was on the PC

556
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
versions.

557
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
No.

558
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,560
That's most unfortunate.

559
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,240
They're saying that the first two are going to be available in September.

560
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Wow.

561
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,840
I don't know though, I kind of don't care about Tomb Raider anymore.

562
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,720
I played that Tomb Raider game on the 360, I don't even remember what it was called,

563
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,400
the retail release that came out a few months ago, I didn't really dig it, kind of over

564
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Lara Croft.

565
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,520
Yeah, I haven't really cared about her since you could throw her off the balcony in Tomb

566
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,440
Raider II and break her neck and do the exploding code.

567
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,940
It was kind of fun to kill her off.

568
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,200
And lock her butler in the lock-in freezer.

569
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Could you really do that?

570
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Yes, you could.

571
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,000
That's the only way you could keep him from following you.

572
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
All right.

573
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,120
Well, while those downloadable contents will be out in September, there's plenty of games

574
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,240
coming out before then.

575
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,080
We're going to travel around the world and cover some upcoming release dates.

576
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,960
And what better way to start it off than listen to me horribly butcher some Japanese game

577
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,160
names of the stuff that's coming out soon.

578
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,720
On the Xbox 360 on June 28th, Project Silpheed is coming out.

579
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,320
It's actually going to the Asian regions, not just Japan.

580
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,760
A Donkey Kong Bongo Blast and Taru Jet Race is coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June

581
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
28th.

582
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,480
I believe that is the Bongo-less Bongo game because you have the Wiimotes.

583
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,440
Kind of fun, interesting.

584
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,500
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Marvel Ultimate Alliance finally hits Japan on June 28th.

585
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,600
And also you can get Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas in the Japanese region on that same

586
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
day, all coming out on June 28th.

587
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,160
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, a game called Baroque from Sting.

588
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,520
A special edition of Devil May Cry 3, but that's just a price reduction really.

589
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,280
Also an earlier version of Dragon Quest goes into the Ultimate Hits collection.

590
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,680
I believe this is one of the side quest stories.

591
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:21,120
Actually a special edition thing for Devil May Cry 3, I believe is the one that they

592
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,560
released over here where it was the greatest hits, but they also added an additional playable

593
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,600
character and additional difficulties.

594
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,720
This is a reduction for a Dragon Quest 8 spin-off story that was on the PlayStation 2, and I

595
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,720
don't remember this game being here.

596
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,860
I don't know if they have reported this over here, perhaps somebody else in our chatroom

597
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,560
knows a little more about that game.

598
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
No.

599
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,120
Now I don't think that game ever came out here, because that's because the game is way

600
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,740
bigger over in Japan.

601
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,960
Also coming out, Metal Slug on the PlayStation 2, yes, moving into the best hits.

602
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
What?

603
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
What?

604
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
What?

605
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
What?

606
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,680
I love Metal Slug.

607
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,240
I'll kill you.

608
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,560
Let's see, also coming out on June 28th in Japan, Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra.

609
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
What?

610
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,600
Excuse me, what?

611
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,400
Why do they keep putting out games for that anime that's been, what, 10 years gone now?

612
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Because people buy them.

613
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,280
The ones on Saturn sucked.

614
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,840
The one on Nintendo 64 sucked.

615
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,440
Why do they keep doing it?

616
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,240
Tales of Fandom Volume 2 coming out from Namco Bandai on June 28th, also on the PlayStation

617
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
2.

618
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,880
Taito Memories, also known as Eternal Hits, coming out in two versions.

619
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,960
That's Gekkan and Jukkan, and I believe that's very similar to what we have over here as

620
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,800
the Taito Greatest Hits collection, the comparable thing we have here already in America.

621
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,200
Also coming out in Japan, The King of Fighters XI moving into the best hits collection on

622
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
the 28th.

623
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,320
That's in case moving a lot of stuff into best hits on PlayStation 2.

624
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,520
Quickly checking the handheld systems, Kuri Kuri DS is coming out on June 28th.

625
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Otasuke Island.

626
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,880
This looks like one of those cute little chibi games, I don't know, it's an action game.

627
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,560
Looks like with bunnies and an angry pink bunny sailing a ship.

628
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,940
That's what I can tell from the box art, because I don't bother to read up on what these games

629
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,240
are really about.

630
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,840
Konami is releasing a game over in Japan on the DS called Otona no Joryoku Kentai, which

631
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,880
looks like a game with sexy ladies.

632
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,680
Looks like another dating sim type game, I'm not sure what this is.

633
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,560
Looks like another dating sim type game, we'll just call it that.

634
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,880
And let's see, also coming out, I'm just checking real quick to see what's coming out on the

635
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,840
PSP.

636
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,480
Lots of releases here on June 28th.

637
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:46,080
Ratchet & Clank gets its PSP release on June 28th, and just for Jamie, Secret of Evangelion

638
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,960
Portable coming out on the 28th.

639
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
That's it!

640
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:01,200
I wish it was all Neon Genesis over here too, that would have been funny, but it's not.

641
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,040
So anyways, next week there's a ton of releases, a lot of them coming out based on movies,

642
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,360
one of which is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, that's going to be coming

643
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:18,800
out on almost everything, PlayStation 2, PSP, 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii, PSP, and

644
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,240
I believe DS also.

645
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,720
Then of course Ratatouille, that's going to be coming out on almost everything, PlayStation

646
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,880
2, GameCube, PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii, DS, and PSP.

647
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,400
Now Transformers, that's going to be coming out on all the console systems, so that'll

648
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,040
be pretty cool.

649
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,000
And then on the Wii, we've got Pokemon Battle Revolution, so that's pretty slick.

650
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,080
The Biggs is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PlayStation 3, and 360, kind of like

651
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,320
an arcade style baseball game.

652
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,040
Grim Grimoire is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, that one's supposed to be pretty

653
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,680
good.

654
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,760
Also on PSP, just this small little game called Final Fantasy is going to be coming out as

655
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
well.

656
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,320
What's that game about?

657
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
I've never heard of it.

658
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,800
I don't know, but I hear it's kind of a Japanese style game.

659
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Oh, then never mind.

660
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,440
I don't know if I'll be playing that, but never mind.

661
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,320
Then of course, this is actually something I'm interested in, TracksPad, it's kind

662
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:31,600
of a portable music studio type thing, so I'm going to be picking that up, maybe make

663
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,960
some music with that.

664
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,280
And then on 360 also, we had Hour of Victory coming out, Overlord, it's making its way

665
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,960
out here, and on PlayStation 3, hopefully, Rainbow Six Vegas, because that thing's

666
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,520
been delayed so many freaking times.

667
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,160
And I believe that's it.

668
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,480
I have some stuff.

669
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,120
Alright, who's release dates do you have?

670
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,720
These are the UK release dates.

671
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,480
On the 26th, we have Cosmic Family for Wii, and Harry Potter and the Odor of Phoenix.

672
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,920
Sorry, Odor.

673
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,680
And then a bunch of crap on the 29th, we have Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars on PSP, I love Crazy

674
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:20,600
Taxi, Driver Parallel Lines, Final Fantasy 6 Advance, which I already have in my purse,

675
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,660
Hour of Victory, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition, more brain training from Dr. Kalashima, How

676
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,880
Old is Your Brain?, Project Silpheed, I want Project Silpheed!

677
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Sorry.

678
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Few more weeks.

679
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Few more weeks.

680
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,960
No, you have no idea, I played the shit out of Silpheed on the Sega CD.

681
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,680
Second week in July.

682
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,520
When I saw the thing for Project Silpheed, I about crapped my pants or something, I don't

683
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
care.

684
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Oops, I crapped my pants.

685
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
Oops, I crapped my pants.

686
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,160
I was all like, Silpheed, pretty.

687
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,360
Did you make that little moaning noise that you made earlier?

688
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,080
That made the chat room go, oh really?

689
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:03,240
Anyway, Puzzle League DS, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, which I hear is absolutely really

690
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:11,920
awesome, Super Stardust HD on Playstation 3, Tenchu Z, The Darkness, sounds like a bad

691
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:20,320
fan fiction, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas,

692
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,360
Vampire Reign, Agon Lost Swords of Toledo, is that like Ohio?

693
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Is this Toledo?

694
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Is that Ohio?

695
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:34,840
Okay, we're going to Ohio to look for the sword, and Eye of Shit, I mean Eye of Judgment.

696
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
What the?

697
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Wait, Eye of Judgment?

698
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Wait, no, no, no.

699
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
PlayStation 3.

700
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Aw, something's gotta be screwed up with that calendar.

701
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
29th.

702
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Really?

703
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Yep.

704
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
What?

705
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
That's a bit early, it seems.

706
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
It does.

707
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
And Steel Horizons.

708
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,640
I was going to say, there's a few that I missed for the U.S. Darkness, which isn't just a

709
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,320
fan fiction, I hope you know.

710
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,880
It's actually a Top Cow comic, I believe, I thought it was published by Image as well,

711
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
being made into a live action movie as well.

712
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,840
It's kind of like a cross between demonic possession and a mafia story type thing, basically

713
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,800
rip people apart with demons.

714
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,520
And what was the other one?

715
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,400
Oh, Driver Parallel Lines for the Wii, but you know, you probably don't want to pick

716
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,200
that one up anyways, so.

717
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Darkness.

718
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,880
Isn't that a cliche thing to call your game or whatever, Darkness, I don't know.

719
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,400
But that's the name of the comic book series, the Darkness.

720
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,600
It's the demonic thing that possessed him.

721
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,280
Alright, anything else, Dark Sakura for our UK listeners?

722
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Your mom!

723
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Really?

724
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,560
What platform is she coming out on?

725
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,640
The Last Knight platform.

726
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,480
I hate you.

727
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,680
Going over to the Virtual Console, I know a lot of you kids like to download the old

728
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,160
school classics on the Wii Virtual Console, and leave it to the ESRB to blow some more

729
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,440
ideas on titles that are coming out.

730
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,560
Shining Force is coming out for the Sega Genesis soon.

731
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,080
Super Turrican and Super Turrican 2 soon.

732
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,640
But most interesting of all, a game called Dr. Mario Wii.

733
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Now you'll notice that the Wii, now people don't really know what this is, if this is

734
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,120
like a typo, if they just meant to put Dr. Mario and they put like the Wii or whatever

735
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,840
is in there, or if this is actually like a whole new game, hmm, wouldn't that be something,

736
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,520
a whole new game based on Dr. Mario?

737
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
That sounds like fun to me.

738
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,000
I would be really impressed if it were SNK, but unfortunately...

739
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,480
I don't think it would be, seeing as Dr. Mario is a Nintendo license.

740
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,280
No, I'm talking about the whole new game part.

741
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Alright.

742
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,260
Alright, well that's pretty much it, so be on the lookout for that, and hopefully that

743
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,520
Dr. Mario Wii thing is a new thing.

744
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,840
You know, in my mind, if that is something new, that would be the perfect thing to release

745
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,560
the week of E3.

746
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Mark my words.

747
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,500
Dr. Mario Wii.

748
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,740
It's a start.

749
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,240
It's not, you know, probably a game that a lot of us are going to get super duper excited

750
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,520
about, but it's a start.

751
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,440
It's something we don't have yet.

752
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
You know what I mean?

753
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,640
It's something new being made for the Wii, if that makes any sense.

754
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,680
It's better than everybody votes channel, okay?

755
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,940
Let's just leave it at that.

756
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,100
Everybody votes channel!

757
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,960
Everybody votes to change this channel.

758
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,360
I fucking hate that channel, by the way.

759
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,120
Just completely useless.

760
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,800
Anyways, so, interesting rumor, kind of also associated with Nintendo here.

761
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:33,160
That would be that they will be licensing their properties to be made into games onto

762
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,720
the Apple iPhone.

763
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,160
I don't know if anyone remembers, back in the day, there was a certain platform which

764
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,640
they licensed their games to be made onto.

765
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,480
Yeah, CDI games didn't turn out very well.

766
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,600
But apparently, they're supposed to be coming out on the iPhone, priced at about $29 each.

767
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:05,860
So is $29 worth paying for a downloadable game that's going to be probably a remake

768
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,840
of Mario Brothers?

769
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
I don't know.

770
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,480
Sounds more like a rumor to me.

771
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,040
Okay, the most interesting thing about this story, like, I could kind of care less about

772
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
the game.

773
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,920
I personally am not interested in the iPhone, but I have a lot of friends who are, like,

774
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,400
doing the campout thing and all that crap to get this stupid phone.

775
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,760
Not my thing, but I don't have $600 to burn.

776
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,300
For those that want it, hey, good for you.

777
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,320
Can I have a loan?

778
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,520
But the point behind this story, Yuri Lover in chat sums it up perfectly, OMG, Nintendo

779
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,120
and Apple are in bed together.

780
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,280
I mean, this is what the fanboys wanted, like, years ago.

781
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,200
They kept saying, gee, Nintendo likes to put cute things out, Apple likes to put cute things

782
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,320
out in different colors, just like Nintendo, why aren't these companies in bed together?

783
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,780
And here they go, there's a little foreplay going on here with this story, right?

784
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,780
Is this foreplay?

785
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,320
I think it's just a rumor, to be honest.

786
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,480
You think this is just bullshit?

787
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,720
I think this is bullshit, but it wouldn't surprise me that they're going to try to

788
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,680
whore themselves out and it wouldn't surprise me that stupid morons that pay $600 for a

789
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,400
fucking phone would pay $30 for downloadable content on said phone.

790
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,620
Geniuses that buy this shit, so, way to go.

791
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,440
You know what, maybe you should go purchase a Playstation 3 while you're at it, since

792
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,360
you didn't have all this excess money to throw around.

793
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,800
Are you just mad because you're poor?

794
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,680
No, I don't want this fucking phone.

795
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,840
I would not pay $600 for a goddamn phone.

796
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,600
So anyway, for anyone who is one of our friends in the UK, they just got a big treat on the

797
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,480
Virtual Console.

798
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Guess what's out?

799
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,480
Mega Man!

800
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,240
Um, your mom, oh.

801
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,560
No, my mom doesn't put out for me.

802
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Mega Mom.

803
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:50,020
Mega Man just made it out for 500 Wii points, and from Turbografx-16 China Warriors is another

804
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,320
new one on there.

805
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:59,440
They are both games from 1989, but, um, dude, I'm just excited about Mega Man, because,

806
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,920
you know, all the Mega Man 2, though, was really the better game.

807
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,360
Mega Man, though, was really cool.

808
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,960
Is one of the ones that has beaten.

809
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,640
I like Mega Man and all, but what about, you know, the whole Mega Man collection that was

810
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,080
on GameCube and the Wii's backwards compatible, you know?

811
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,080
Do people care?

812
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,080
Yeah, me.

813
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,720
I'm not gonna spend money on the Virtual Console Mega Man when that game's out there.

814
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,500
Well, neither am I. I mean, I have the freaking cartridge.

815
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,760
By the way, I can't lend you one of my Nintendos, but that's another story.

816
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,480
Um, but, you know, but for people who may not have bought the collection or may just

817
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,960
say, oh, well, that's pretty cool, Mega Man, they might want to get it, so.

818
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,320
So in other words, for lazy people who are one-click shoppers.

819
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Yeah.

820
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Alright, there you go.

821
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Very good.

822
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,320
Very good.

823
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
Then carry on.

824
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
And talk to me later about the Nintendo.

825
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,320
Carry on one-click.

826
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Did you say you can borrow it?

827
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
I have, like, three.

828
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
You can borrow one.

829
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Sweet!

830
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
I thought you said you can't.

831
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
No.

832
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,720
I'm totally gonna get a copy of Guardian Legend for myself.

833
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
You can borrow mine, too, if you want.

834
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
Awesomeness.

835
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
I'm not playing it.

836
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,720
I can only tear myself away from World of Warcraft.

837
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,920
There are free, easier methods to, you know, obtain Guardian Legends to play it on a console.

838
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,240
It's not the same.

839
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
It's not the same.

840
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I can't explain it.

841
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,240
It's not the same.

842
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,000
Those little imperfections bug me.

843
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There's something rewarding about blowing on the cartridge and putting it in the machine

844
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,300
and it'll finally work at some point.

845
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,300
I don't know.

846
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,880
I'm not talking about that.

847
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,180
Hopefully there's a lot of rewards from this game as well or else there's gonna be a lot

848
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,360
of people that are pissed off because Spore, which you might remember was my favorite game

849
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,400
I saw at last year's E3, well, I'm gonna be waiting a long frickin' time to play this

850
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:40,500
game, as are all of you, because this game has been pushed back to the fiscal year 2009.

851
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,400
That means that it will, at earliest, come out in April of 2008.

852
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,480
Now some folks were, you know, this game was already supposed to be out, then it got pushed

853
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,880
back to this fiscal year, then it got pushed back to next fiscal year, then it was like,

854
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,840
oh, it's gonna come out by the Christmas, oh, it's gonna come out first quarter 2008,

855
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:04,680
here we go again, it just got delayed to April 2008 at the earliest.

856
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,520
And it's so weird because when, you know, when we saw the demo, I was like, this game

857
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,400
looks like it's almost done.

858
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,400
The game looks great.

859
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,360
I mean, maybe that's why they only showed us one element of the game, you know, maybe

860
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,760
looks can be deceiving, but I don't know.

861
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,120
It's just it's a massive game and they want to make sure they get it right, that's all.

862
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,880
For a change, yay!

863
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,840
Gerardimo calls this game in our chat room Spore Forever, a little play on Duke Nukem

864
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
Forever, get it?

865
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,360
Yeah, but at least we've actually seen screenshots and like, you know, playable Spore, like,

866
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,940
you know, because they show, I mean, even though you weren't able to play the demo yourself,

867
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:46,240
they did kind of like a, you know, a user-assisted tutorial type thing at E3 and it looked, it

868
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
looked pretty awesome.

869
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,360
I mean, it was awesome enough to get me the most excited over any other game I saw at

870
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,360
E3 last year.

871
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,960
It looked awesome.

872
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,040
But nevertheless, I am pissed off about the fact that this game is delayed.

873
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:02,120
I don't know how Loki and Dark Sakura feel, but since I'm at the soundboard and I'm angry

874
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:15,600
enough, I push the button and out come the FUs.

875
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,160
Dark Sakura, start us off.

876
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,320
Um, FU to life.

877
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
I'm sorry to hear that.

878
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,320
That's it?

879
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Yeah.

880
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,720
But that's a good blanket FU to kind of encompass everything.

881
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,560
Oh yeah, because there's a whole bunch of shit going on, so FU to all of it.

882
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,560
Sorry to hear that.

883
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:38,960
Uh, once again, I would like to repeat my distaste for street smart cool cat.

884
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,320
That fucking idiot can die in a fire and I hope your game sucks balls and does not sell

885
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,560
one piece.

886
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,640
It is horrible and you need to stop.

887
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,320
I would like to say FU to Bobby Blackwell for correcting me in chat saying dude knew

888
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,600
them forever was playable at E3 1998 on the Quake 2 engine.

889
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,840
FU Bobby and your old show 100 weeks, whatever.

890
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,840
Just kidding.

891
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,840
I heart Bobby.

892
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:16,720
I also want to say a big FU to the DMV because I have to go there tomorrow and nobody likes

893
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,040
going to the DMV because I have to get my license renewed because my birthday is coming

894
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,880
up and I got to get that all taken care of before my birthday or else I won't have a

895
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
driver's license.

896
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,720
FU to the possibility I may not have a driver's license.

897
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,720
That's it.

898
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,840
Anyways, so there's something actually pretty cool coming out of the homebrew scene and

899
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:43,000
that is a sequel, a homebrew sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog and it actually looks pretty

900
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
cool.

901
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:52,200
The name of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog XG or Extended Genesis and pretty much captures

902
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,100
the original Sonic the Hedgehog game series very accurately.

903
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:03,080
It's scheduled to have 10 unique zones, 18 acts along with his secret zone after Chaos

904
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:11,600
Central and no word though on what it's coming out on, I would assume PC, but pretty

905
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
awesome.

906
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,320
They have a video on Destructoid if you want to check it out.

907
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Really cool looking game.

908
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,320
Not even really a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

909
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,480
Hopefully it gets released and you can download it before Sega's lawyers get on them.

910
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,920
Oh, that would be nice.

911
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,240
Well, other Sonic news that I think is actually kind of cool is BioWare is doing a Sonic RPG

912
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,720
that's going to be on the Nintendo DS.

913
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,600
It's supposed to be out in 2008.

914
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:46,120
There's not a whole bunch out on it, but it's just saying that Sega is standing behind

915
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,080
what BioWare has planned doing and BioWare wants to do it, blah, blah, blah.

916
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,800
So I hope it's good.

917
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,800
It could be.

918
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,720
You know, they did good stuff for what, didn't they do Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic,

919
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,720
so...

920
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,040
And the upcoming Mass Effect game, which is going to be like one of the best role playing

921
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,560
games for the 360.

922
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,760
You hope.

923
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
It looks...

924
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
It does look pretty frickin' amazing.

925
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
Amazing.

926
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
Look at that.

927
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,000
Every time I hear about this, I think about the Mario RPG for some sick reason.

928
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,320
I mean, because you know, Squeenix helped to make, well, it was just Square back then,

929
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,880
but Squaresoft made the Mario RPG game, and that was like a top of the line developer,

930
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,960
especially back at that time at the... I remember Final Fantasy was like all the rage

931
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,800
at that point.

932
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,240
Just kind of interesting that now you have this BioWare who's kind of like also an A-list

933
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,160
developer kind of making this Sonic RPG.

934
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,600
I just hope it doesn't blow chunks like all the other Sonic games that have come out in

935
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,600
the past three years.

936
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,600
My thoughts exactly.

937
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,240
And you know, that makes me also pissed off because remember there was, I think, Square

938
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,640
Enix was saying that they wanted to dedicate themselves to the Nintendo platforms.

939
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,280
Make me another goddamn Super Mario RPG.

940
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,660
Since you've dedicated yourself to the Nintendo platforms, why don't you make yourself useful

941
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:02,680
and do that instead of making another fuckin' sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

942
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,960
It's a BlackDevilRX in chat.

943
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,320
It says, Sega and BioWare are in bed... We have a lot of in bed stories tonight.

944
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
What's up with that?

945
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,320
Go figure.

946
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,480
Before we get to the next story, I actually want to share this comment.

947
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,160
BlackBoy, thank you buddy, who actually was featured on GayGamer.net this week, by the

948
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,160
way, I noticed.

949
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,160
Congratulations to you, BlackBoy.

950
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:24,680
He actually sent me a link that contests the whole Spore is Delayed story that we just

951
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,680
reported on.

952
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,600
Apparently, another website picked this up, NextGen.biz, a pretty popular site for gaming

953
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,620
news, picked up that actually there's a little bit of misinformation going on with that story.

954
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,320
They already announced a long time ago that the game was going to be delayed to the next

955
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,920
fiscal year, but some people were picking up this story, and for some reason saying

956
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,460
that the fiscal year 2009 meant April 2009, which isn't the case.

957
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:54,120
We did say that meant April 2008, but EA wants to tell you that's not nothing new.

958
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:01,600
There's a quote here from... This comes from John Riccitello, CEO, says, quote, there seems

959
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,280
to be some misinformation flying around.

960
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,420
Nothing's changed since our call on May 8th, where John Riccitello specifically said that

961
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:14,660
we were moving Spore from fiscal 08 to early fiscal 09.

962
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,520
Maybe that Spore thing wasn't news after all, but I'm still angsty about it.

963
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,680
That's a long time to wait.

964
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,000
I actually still was thinking it was coming out Christmas this year.

965
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,040
I somehow missed the boat on that story.

966
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
Go figure.

967
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,280
Nevertheless, thanks for the corrections.

968
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,560
We report on what's big on the gaming blogs out there and what catches our eye, and we're

969
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,840
not always going to be 100% on target, but we try to get close.

970
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,800
Hopefully, this is accurate, because this is something trying to foresee things a little

971
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
bit.

972
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:46,120
This would be the list of Halo 3 achievements coming to you, thanks to Xbox360achievements.org.

973
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,800
For those of you that are achievement point whores, Loki...

974
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,840
I'm buying the game.

975
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,840
You're not buying it?

976
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
No.

977
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,120
You're not really a first-person shooter fan, right?

978
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,280
Not really a Halo fan.

979
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,160
If I bought it, would you want to borrow it to try and get some of the achievements?

980
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
No.

981
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,160
All right.

982
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,420
Well, for those of you that like to get your achievements and you like your Halo, you can

983
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:09,960
be looking forward to some various achievements, including basically it looks like every chapter

984
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,240
in the game gets its own achievement, up to nine chapters, the ninth chapter being called

985
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,520
Return, some achievements for when you complete the campaign on Normal, Heroic, and Legendary,

986
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,840
also some Hidden Skulls, looking like they claim some different achievements throughout

987
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
the game.

988
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,600
Then, of course, there are some various player versus player achievements, awards being given

989
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:39,780
for Triple Kill, Overkill, Headshots, and then some achievements still in question because

990
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,880
you actually see the achievement says score over X amount of points in the campaign meta

991
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,480
game on the second mission for some various achievements named such thing as Demon, Gorilla,

992
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,160
Vanguard, Reclaimer, so looks like about nine different achievements there, so kind of interesting.

993
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,400
So that's what the achievements look like for Halo 3.

994
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,400
Someone was asking me in chat room what my favorite all-time first-person shooter is.

995
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,720
TimeSplitters 2, fucking awesome game.

996
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,040
Anyways, let's see here.

997
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,320
There's some interesting developments in the whole Immersion thing.

998
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:25,440
Remember back, Immersion, of course, sued Sony over the rumble technology in their controllers.

999
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,520
So now we've got Microsoft suing Immersion, and the reason is apparently because the whole

1000
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,320
Sony lawsuit, and since they settled on that, that violates some sort of agreement that

1001
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,920
Microsoft had with Immersion when they were licensing the technology.

1002
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,320
According to Microsoft, Microsoft licenses technology in both in and out and relies on

1003
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,820
these agreements to be honored and enforced.

1004
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,840
Our request to the court is that all companies and industry partners should play by the same

1005
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,920
rules and that the binding agreement we signed with Immersion be honored.

1006
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,740
In other words, they're suing because they settled with Sony, and basically that would

1007
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:09,320
kind of say that Sony is not playing by the same rules, so I don't know.

1008
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,320
Poor babies.

1009
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,960
Let's pout and sue.

1010
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,240
What exactly, somebody remind me, because I haven't really been following the details

1011
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,240
of all these stories.

1012
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,920
I just see the headlines and I go, oh, lawsuit, lawsuit.

1013
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,940
What exactly has Immersion done for gaming?

1014
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,840
They developed apparently rumble technology.

1015
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,040
Apparently they developed rumble technology.

1016
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,460
Well, they have trademarks, so.

1017
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:39,180
But was it one of those things where like, because I remember, did they develop the first,

1018
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,800
what is it, the Nintendo CC4 rumble pack was the first thing that had rumble, right?

1019
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,360
Yeah, I think so.

1020
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,720
Did they develop that?

1021
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
No.

1022
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:52,240
It's one of those companies that makes a patent or patents something and then sits on it until

1023
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,760
someone makes it and then they go and sue them.

1024
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,240
Interesting.

1025
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,480
Because I'm like, what exactly has Immersion done besides sue people and get sued?

1026
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,760
Like have they ever made a game?

1027
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,840
Have they ever made a third party product?

1028
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,840
No.

1029
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,840
Nothing.

1030
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
Interesting.

1031
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,340
So, what a waste of everybody's time this company seems to be, unless I'm totally missing

1032
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,280
something here, because I can't think of anything Immersion has actually done.

1033
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,520
I'll look them up on Wikipedia during this next statement, where Dark Soccer is going

1034
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:27,520
to surf the internet ups and down and all over and try to find her favorite website

1035
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,120
of the week, and this better be a good one, because it is a special show tonight.

1036
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:38,120
Dark Soccer, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

1037
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,600
Today's website of the week is one that should be near and dear to the hearts of anyone who

1038
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,560
has ever gotten married.

1039
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,520
It's UglyDress.com.

1040
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,880
It's a dress, it shows the worst bridesmaids dresses ever with photographs.

1041
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,480
And these are really awful.

1042
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:06,280
There's one on here that looks like a flag, and I'm not even joking, it's really nasty.

1043
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:15,520
And it's not just weddings either, it's ugly cakes, and ugly shoes, and tuxedos and shit.

1044
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,160
It's really just awful, awful stuff.

1045
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:26,200
There's some show that they all watch on Ventrilo in World of Warcraft, the guild, and it's

1046
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,920
very similar to what you're talking about.

1047
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,040
It's like, God, now I can't remember the name of the show.

1048
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,400
It's like Fashion Emergency or something like that, or you can't wear that outside.

1049
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,880
I can't think of the name of the show.

1050
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,080
Loki, you're laughing, you know what I'm talking about?

1051
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,360
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

1052
00:56:40,360 --> 00:57:03,700
I don't know, but when Dark

1053
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:15,280
War

1054
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:21,000
Anyway, I looked up Immersion Corporation, by the way, on Wikipedia.

1055
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,880
BlackWolf in chat came to save the day because BlackWolf knows more about gaming than I do,

1056
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
apparently.

1057
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,200
BlackWolf said, Sky, Immersion patented the technology behind the PlayStation and Xbox

1058
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,000
Rumble technology.

1059
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,800
And I'm looking at Wikipedia here.

1060
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,080
Immersion Corporation of San Jose, California is a developer of Haptic Technology.

1061
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,180
The company was founded in 1993.

1062
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,240
Immersion's technology is employed in automotive, entertainment, medical training, mobility,

1063
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,160
personal computing, and three-dimensional simulation applications.

1064
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,120
Immersion's patent portfolio includes over 500 issues or pending patents in the U.S.

1065
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,840
and other countries.

1066
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,780
Immersion was used as an example in an article on patent trolls by Game Daily Biz.

1067
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,200
So I guess we're not the first people to say something about that, so kudos to Game Daily

1068
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,200
Biz.

1069
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,880
I'm glad they have something called patent trolls.

1070
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
That's kind of funny.

1071
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,460
Thank you, Wonder Dog Herald in chat.

1072
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,040
It's called What Not to Wear, is the name of the show.

1073
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,200
It's called What Not to Wear.

1074
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,720
So you should check out that show, DarkStarter, because I know you don't watch TV.

1075
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,720
Isn't that on style?

1076
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,720
Here's a torrent.

1077
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,720
I don't know.

1078
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:21,720
That's on Style Network.

1079
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,720
I think so.

1080
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,720
Why do I know this?

1081
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,720
I don't even have that.

1082
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,960
Because your wife probably watches it.

1083
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,800
It totally sounds like something your wife probably watches.

1084
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:39,920
All right, anyhow, just trying to get caught up on some other chat room comments here.

1085
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,880
Saikun says, stop using us, Rob, because I guess I'm using the chat room to do research

1086
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,760
tonight.

1087
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,320
Let's go on to another story here.

1088
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,140
Last week we had a fun little debate on video game addiction, which you'll remember Jamie

1089
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,080
lost because she made fun of me.

1090
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,520
And when you make fun of me, you instantly lose.

1091
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,960
But I make fun of you all the time.

1092
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,960
I know.

1093
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,960
And so you lose all the time.

1094
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,960
No, just kidding.

1095
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,720
But what's interesting about this is this is a news article that was released by the

1096
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,720
Associated Press.

1097
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,080
So it was picked up on sites by Yahoo and CNN and some of those sites.

1098
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,560
Video game addiction could possibly be a new diagnosis.

1099
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,280
This is somewhat a bit of a follow-up to the article we were talking about last week.

1100
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,680
The AMA is going to be having this meeting, and it already started in Chicago.

1101
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,520
And the council is going to be asking the group to lobby for the disorder to be included

1102
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,280
in a widely used mental illness manual created and published by the American Psychiatric

1103
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,000
Association, video game addiction.

1104
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,520
Now if this were actually happening, this could mean that possibly your insurance would

1105
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,080
cover this as any other type of mental disorder like alcoholism.

1106
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,800
So would they have to cover buying more games?

1107
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,440
Because obviously I'm addicted to games, and I need that.

1108
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,440
I can't wean myself up.

1109
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,840
I don't think it works like that actually.

1110
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,920
It's like the gum or something.

1111
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,040
Most insurance companies don't cover this type of thing very well anyway, even if it

1112
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,040
even covers it at all.

1113
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,680
I mean, insurance companies have to cover certain mental conditions, but I don't think

1114
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,680
this is one of them.

1115
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,440
It's my medicinal pot because I'm stuck playing video games.

1116
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,440
Actually insurance companies don't cover, don't ask me how I know so much about insurance,

1117
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,440
but I do.

1118
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,760
Insurance companies don't cover marijuana because it's not a federally recognized drug.

1119
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,640
It's only recognized in certain states.

1120
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,240
So your insurance company typically won't cover marijuana, just so you know.

1121
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,480
But you can get a prescription for it.

1122
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,200
You can in certain states.

1123
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,200
Yes.

1124
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,200
Including California.

1125
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,200
And there's only certain farms that are allowed to grow it.

1126
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,160
I'm sorry, how did we get from video game diagnosis story to pot growing?

1127
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,200
Because we give our listeners what they want to know.

1128
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,600
I see.

1129
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,280
Anyway, from the story here, I want to point this out.

1130
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:48,280
Joyce Protopapas of Frisco, Texas said her 17-year-old son Michael was a video game addict.

1131
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,680
Actually, the story says a video addict.

1132
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,440
Over nearly two years, video and internet games transformed him from an outgoing academically

1133
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,520
gifted team into a reclusive manipulator who flunked two 10th grade classes and spent several

1134
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:04,080
hours a day and night playing a popular online video game called World of Warcraft.

1135
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:09,040
My father was an alcoholic and I saw exactly the same thing and Michael said, Protopapas,

1136
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,520
we battled him until October of last year.

1137
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
We went to therapists.

1138
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,060
We tried taking the game away.

1139
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,300
He would threaten us physically.

1140
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,360
He would curse and call us every name imaginable.

1141
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,360
It was if he was possessed.

1142
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,480
And when she suggested to therapists that Michael had a video game addiction, nobody

1143
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,520
was familiar with it.

1144
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,140
They all pooh-poohed it.

1145
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,760
And finally, they found a therapist and they sent Michael to a therapeutic boarding school,

1146
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,960
$5,000 a month that the insurance didn't cover to get him kicked off the video game.

1147
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,480
You know what my mom would have done if I flunked a class over video games?

1148
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,980
She would have thrown the TV out a window or she actually did this once.

1149
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:47,520
She took the power cord to the Nintendo so I couldn't hook it up to the TV for months

1150
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,400
and I wasn't at the age where I could just run out and buy a new power cord because I

1151
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,020
was only 14 when this happened.

1152
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:58,240
So I couldn't hook up the Nintendo for a couple months because I was doing badly in a class.

1153
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,280
And I realize the mom is saying that the kid was going off and threatening her physically

1154
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
and all this other stuff.

1155
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:08,120
But to me, that's a whole other issue that needs dealing with.

1156
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,040
That's like just making a bad thing worse to add the whole world up thing.

1157
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,720
I'm powerless to do anything about these video games.

1158
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,540
Fucking bullshit is what it is.

1159
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:21,460
She needs to get off her fucking drunken ass and take care of her damn kids is what she

1160
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,680
needs to do.

1161
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,680
I don't know.

1162
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,720
I think it's stupid that she couldn't just take away the game system.

1163
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,720
He's a 14-year-old.

1164
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,920
Beat the crap out of him.

1165
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,800
It's easy.

1166
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,800
If she can't do it...

1167
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,160
I don't know if I would go that far.

1168
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,780
She should put him in one of those deprivation tanks.

1169
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,400
It sounds like he had a lot of problems besides just video games and maybe he should have

1170
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,380
gone to the boarding school already.

1171
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,840
That's a good idea.

1172
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,560
I agree with you, Rob.

1173
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,440
Once again, you know, other problems and then because he's playing video games, obviously

1174
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,760
the video games have a problem.

1175
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,760
Fucking hate people.

1176
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
Hold on.

1177
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,840
Did Jamie say she agreed with me?

1178
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,880
Oh my God.

1179
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,800
It only took five years and finally Jamie agrees with me on something.

1180
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,360
This is a blessed holy day.

1181
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,360
I'm so excited.

1182
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,080
Jamie finally agrees with me.

1183
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,840
Is this like your present to me on this anniversary show or something?

1184
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,840
Rob?

1185
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,840
What?

1186
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
Rob.

1187
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
What?

1188
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,840
Rob.

1189
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,840
Rob.

1190
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,840
I will kill you in the face.

1191
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,840
Art, you're...

1192
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,840
Have a jammy dodger.

1193
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,280
I don't want a jammy dodger.

1194
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,960
Hey, all of our Eddie Izzard fans, I bought jammy dodgers.

1195
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,600
Will you dodger that jammy when I shove it up your ass?

1196
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,640
Then fine.

1197
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,940
You don't get any of the, um, stuff I bought for part B.

1198
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,680
No, but I want the stuff you brought for part B.

1199
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,380
The stuff I bought for part B is great.

1200
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:40,380
So...

1201
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:41,380
Sorry.

1202
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,420
Some news comes from apparently a...

1203
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,420
Oh wait.

1204
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,420
I'm sorry.

1205
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,420
Can I read chat comments?

1206
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,480
chat that was a big story so I'm sorry I

1207
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,360
was too busy fighting with Jamie I hope

1208
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,480
you all will understand Ross deal UT

1209
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,660
says it's a symptom of a larger problem

1210
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,040
that is ignored because the video games

1211
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,680
are a scapegoat that's a very good word

1212
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,360
for what's going on there scapegoat gold

1213
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,380
banjo says I have so much video game

1214
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:07,000
systems and stuff that I always have

1215
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,480
stuff to do when my parents take away

1216
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,440
something well maybe they need to lock

1217
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,360
you in a room with with fluffy walls and

1218
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,360
I don't know blaze says I don't buy this

1219
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,160
addiction thing those types of doctors

1220
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,680
are the same to buy into the whole truth

1221
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,040
serum thing yikes all right anyway

1222
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,880
someone is now you can do your story so

1223
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,720
apparently there is this is coming from a

1224
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,560
game spot forum poster said they were

1225
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,800
took part in a recent survey about a

1226
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,440
unannounced PlayStation Network episodic

1227
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,640
game called nine-to-five apparently the

1228
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,160
game is supposed to be kind of like an

1229
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,240
interactive sitcom where you're

1230
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,440
basically kissing the boss's butt to

1231
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,880
avoid being fired you know all sorts of

1232
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,720
weird stuff like that kind of like the

1233
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,520
office or something anyways they're

1234
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,560
saying that it's supposed to have four

1235
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:58,360
episodes which introduce you to mega

1236
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,480
Corp I guess a multinational corporation

1237
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,120
obviously fake each episode supposed to

1238
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,560
be about three hours long with sitcom

1239
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,760
storylines and cliffhangers about 25

1240
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,640
characters they're going to be in the

1241
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,680
actual thing and you can interact with

1242
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,560
each one of them including like flirting

1243
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,520
and whatnot apparently it's going to be

1244
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,200
written by written and I guess voice

1245
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,720
acted by people that have been on comedy

1246
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,560
Central's Saturday Night Live Daily Show

1247
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:33,240
spell show Conan Bryan etc interesting

1248
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,880
and the game supposed to run about five

1249
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,640
dollars for an episode or fourteen

1250
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,280
dollars for all four Wonder Dog Herald

1251
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,360
says nine-to-five should be based on the

1252
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:47,600
movie fuck yes but Dolly Parton hell

1253
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:52,640

1257
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,000

1258
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,920
weekend so I almost watched nine to five

1259
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,200
last night but then I opted to go to bed

1260
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,600
instead I didn't do any pride festivities

1261
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,000

1281
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,440
not as good as Animal Crossing fucking

1282
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,240
same and you people still buy him we're

1283
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,840
starting to wrap up this segment here

1284
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,640
but not out before a couple more stories

1285
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,640
here we want to show Sony a little love

1286
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,720
we haven't really talked a whole lot

1287
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,320
about them tonight we got to say this

1288
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,240
Sony and I don't know if you would

1289
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,600
consider this love though because this

1290
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,320
may be an anti Sony statement I don't

1291
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,240
know here but what's going on here is

1292
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,800
that Sony who is the direct the director

1293
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,120
of PlayStation Network operations Eric

1294
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,600
Lempel said that the PlayStation Network

1295
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,360
may not always be free he said basically

1296
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,160
that the PlayStation Network's only real

1297
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,880
difference over Xbox Live is the price

1298
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,840
which you know mmm interesting but then

1299
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,800
of course then this other exec kind of

1300
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,120
stepped in and then said well it may not

1301
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,240
always be free so kind of interesting

1302
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,160
and I wouldn't say that's the only

1303
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,920
difference between the two well yeah

1304
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,400
that in the Xbox Live Marketplace has a

1305
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,280
lot of content or as the PlayStation

1306
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,480
Network as I understand it has very

1307
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,480
little content now granted PlayStation

1308
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,280
it has some very good content like that

1309
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,040
Tekken game good start and you know

1310
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,560
there's a lot of promising things about

1311
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,720
some of these originals they're making

1312
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,560
on PlayStation Network they look a heck

1313
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,040
of a lot more promising than some of the

1314
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,280
rehash stuff we get on Xbox Live but you

1315
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,560
know is it gonna be too little too late

1316
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,840
that's you know all I worry about so

1317
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,880
that's nice speaking of something a

1318
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,600
little too little too late Dead or Alive

1319
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,400
the movie is delayed forever and it

1320
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,680
finally came out and how did it do well

1321
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:46,360
it sucked it stinks as Jay would say

1322
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:50,320
from the critic apparently opened on

1323
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,200
505 screens across the country and

1324
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,640
pulled in a whopping two hundred and

1325
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,280
thirty two thousand dollars which is

1326
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,240
crappy that's about four hundred and

1327
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,120
sixty dollars per screen oh my god

1328
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,640
that's atrocious that's like what movies

1329
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,800
at discount theaters make like that's

1330
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,600
what a movie is like almost on video

1331
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,680
what it's supposed to make that's really

1332
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,760
bad is that because of is that because

1333
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,800
piracy ruined it is that because I never

1334
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,040
saw a single ad for this game outside of

1335
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,720
the internet anywhere I don't think the

1336
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,840
advertising motion lack of emotion but

1337
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,080
it also opened up against what the hell

1338
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,080
did open up against something that was a

1339
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,400
lot better than it was well to any other

1340
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,840
movie I think it opened up against not

1341
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:36,520
pirates but I mean pirates came out

1342
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,760
shortly before it but just any other

1343
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,520
movie but Fantastic Four I think came

1344
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,240
out the same week Silver Surfer that's

1345
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,920
right which I don't know I'm hearing

1346
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,720
that movie ain't all that either but I

1347
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,200
don't I don't I still want to see it it

1348
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,640
depends on who you ask I don't I don't

1349
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,440
get excited about summer movies anymore

1350
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,240
except for Transformers I really do want

1351
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,720
to see Transformers I didn't want to see

1352
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,040
until I saw those last few trailers let's

1353
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,920
see Ross steel UT says sky it's because

1354
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,040
it sucked and that's what Cy Coon says

1355
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,560
to us because it fucking sucked the afro

1356
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,080
guy said why isn't the dead or alive

1357
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,600
movie on DVD I mean why didn't it go

1358
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,840
straight to DVD that's a good question

1359
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,000
Loki I don't know you used to do before

1360
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,920
you were doing games distribution you

1361
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,040
did movie distribution so any insight on

1362
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,400
that what kind of movies tend to go

1363
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:26,200
directly to DVD well besides the Disney

1364
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,880
sequels like Cinderella three there are

1365
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,400
a lot of Disney sequels they go straight

1366
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,560
to DVD usually movies that they don't

1367
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,120
want to spend money on advertising

1368
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,440
because it costs a lot of money to

1369
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,560
advertise a movie and if they feel it's

1370
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,440
not going to do that well in theaters

1371
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,080
they'll release it straight to DVD you

1372
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,800
get actually there are there's a whole

1373
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,240
you know set of was it a movie companies

1374
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:52,400
that do knockoff movies in fact their

1375
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,920
latest one happens to be spoofing I'll

1376
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,160
really call it spoofing but having the

1377
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:03,120
exact same plot line and stuff as

1378
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,680
transformers is called transmorphers you

1379
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,520
know go bot and also they have was it

1380
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,200
snakes on a train stuff like that so a

1381
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,880
lot of that goes I like cheese just said

1382
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,600
that snakes on the train yeah but um I

1383
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,400
don't know also what was that movie we

1384
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,960
all watched cheerleading ninjas or

1385
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,240
whatever that was cheerleader ninjas

1386
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,080
then it was incredible that was not I've

1387
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,800
got some good ones though I've got some

1388
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,240
good ones that are coming out was it

awesome no that already came out I know

1394
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,840
years ago I know and it was awesome when

1395
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,760
I have a whole clown horror night people

1396
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,040
are raving about the DVD sequels in chat

1397
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,840
even though this isn't game related I

1398
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,200
guess it is a little bit dark Tetsuya

1399
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,680
says I mean really Bambi to WTF I know

1400
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,240
what the hell Bambi to Bambi to my mom

1401
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,320
is still dead no Bambi to Bambi was

1402
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,560
grown up and it's his kids now so oh

1403
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,660
well that makes it okay that's a big

1404
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,720
Disney cop-out I'm sorry the only Bambi

1405
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:11,560
to I was ever interested in was there

1406
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,640
was Godzilla vs. Bambi and then Godzilla

1407
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:18,600
vs. Bambi to Bambi's revenge Godzilla

1408
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,080
vs. Bambi was alone in the dark to the

1409
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,600
afro guy says isn't there a Lion King 4

1410
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,120
I don't think I don't know if there's a

1411
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,680
Lion King for but if I remember right

1412
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,840
there was a Lion King like two and a

1413
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,200
half one in a one and a half but one of

1414
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,280
these movies I don't know if it was one

1415
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,920
and a half or Lion King three one of

1416
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,640
these movies was where the Lion King's

1417
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,840
forever Simba's friends what were his

1418
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,240
friends name that's right too many

1419
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,200
people like the side story about where

1420
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,840
the friends are right now yeah was what

1421
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,000
wall they what the hell was that no it

1422
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It was funny.

1423
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
It was pretty funny.

1424
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
They actually did...

1425
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,880
It was Lion King One and a Half and it was about what was going on from their perspective

1426
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,880
and stuff.

1427
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
And I don't know.

1428
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,880
It was kind of neat.

1429
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,880
It was funny.

1430
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,880
But yeah.

1431
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,880
There's a lot to go straight to DVD.

1432
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,280
I mean, just look at your video store.

1433
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,280
I mean, your local video store.

1434
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,280
So why not Dead or Alive?

1435
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,720
This was a prime candidate to go straight to DVD.

1436
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:13,000
It was supposed to go straight to DVD at one time, but they decided, hey, we're going to

1437
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,280
release it to the theaters because people are going to go see it.

1438
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,940
Boy, were they wrong.

1439
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:19,760
But how much money does it cost to put a movie in theaters?

1440
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,480
I mean, if they didn't spend any money on promotion, did they really lose anything?

1441
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,480
Not a whole lot.

1442
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,480
They probably wouldn't lose anything.

1443
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,360
And it actually probably would help the film a little bit, especially if they leave it

1444
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,320
in there long enough to do a few million dollars.

1445
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,360
Because they'll be able to get that one critic.

1446
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:36,480
Because the thing about putting your movie in theaters is that the critics will review

1447
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,480
it.

1448
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:43,560
So you'll get that one critic who will give the movie an amazing review just because he

1449
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,960
wants to have his name in all the papers in the advertisement.

1450
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:58,760
Dead or Alive is a very tantalizing action movie.

1451
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,760
And it sucks.

1452
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,760
But they wouldn't say that.

1453
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,680
They'd leave that part out.

1454
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,680
Sexy action.

1455
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,960
If you were to call this movie great and awesome, you would be horribly wrong.

1456
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,080
It's great and awesome.

1457
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:16,000
DJ Morpheus in Chat Room makes a local joke.

1458
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,420
Those of you folks from Sacramento will love this joke.

1459
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:24,000
And it's always Mark S. Allen.

1460
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,100
Tiger Claw says there's a Starship Troopers 3 in the works that's going straight to video.

1461
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,120
And Casper Van Dien is reprising the role he did in the first movie.

1462
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,720
That's because Casper Van Dien hasn't really done anything in the series.

1463
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,080
He has done a lot of things.

1464
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,080
Has he?

1465
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,080
It's all straight to DVD.

1466
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,920
Well, that's a heck of a career.

1467
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,880
There's a lot of people that, that's how you know they've kind of lost it.

1468
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,160
There's a Jean-Claude Van Damme and fucking Steven Seagal, man.

1469
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,980
They're still making stuff.

1470
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:51,980
A lot of things.

1471
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,920
Because people actually buy that shit up.

1472
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,800
Same thing with Chuck Norris, dude.

1473
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,160
Chuck Norris hasn't made too much.

1474
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,080
I still say they need to do Chuck Norris vs. The World, you know, because I would say that

1475
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,080
would totally fit.

1476
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,540
I say Freddy vs. Jason vs. Walker Texas Ranger.

1477
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,860
How about that?

1478
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,920
Chuck Norris vs. Michael Myers.

1479
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,760
Okay, now we're crazy.

1480
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:19,680
Alright, anyway, somebody also made a point much earlier, and I apologize because your

1481
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:23,680
comments rolled way off the screen, but somebody said porn goes direct to DVD.

1482
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,680
All of it.

1483
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,680
Yeah.

1484
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:26,680
Well, I don't know.

1485
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,120
We don't really keep tabs of the porno theaters around here.

1486
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,120
Theaters weren't really what they used to be for porn, if you know what I mean.

1487
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,260
Jiranami would like to point out that Orange Lounge is not Baron's Chat.

1488
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,680
That's a World of Warcraft joke.

1489
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:43,680
Anyhow, alright, I guess we're going to bring this segment to a close here.

1490
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,800
We're going to finish off part A here.

1491
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,600
However, part B is coming up, and we're actually going to put the news away tonight for part

1492
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,400
B. We're all done with the news, and actually, I should ask real quick, Logie, do you have

1493
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,400
any last minute things you want to add, because I know you had a few stories.

1494
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,400
Maybe.

1495
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,400
Alright, go ahead.

1496
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,400
Go ahead.

1497
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,400
Well, we'll do it later.

1498
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,400
You want to do it later?

1499
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,400
Yeah, we'll do it later.

1500
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,400
Alright, we'll do it later.

1501
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,400
Fine.

1502
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,400
We'll put it in part B. In an opportune time.

1503
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,400
Alright, then perhaps we're not recording.

1504
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:19,760
The majority of part B will be your calls, and we're dedicating it to you guys, the fans,

1505
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,160
the people that have listened every week, that have stuck with Orange Lounge Radio for

1506
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:28,520
the past five years, and really helped made this show what it is, and quite honestly,

1507
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,000
given us the motivation to continue to do this show.

1508
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
It's never really been about the number of people that are listening, because to put

1509
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,120
it in perspective, we don't talk about the number of people we have listen to our show

1510
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,840
very often, because to me, that's private information.

1511
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,600
That's not really, you know, that's our business, and we don't really need to brag.

1512
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:50,160
But for real, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio had 15 listeners.

1513
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:55,320
We had 15 listeners for episode one of Orange Lounge Radio, and that was after lots of hype,

1514
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,120
lots of, you know, posting on DDR Freak, because we were a Bamani music-related show at the

1515
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,120
time.

1516
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,120
And I couldn't.

1517
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,120
Huh?

1518
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,120
And I couldn't.

1519
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,120
That's right, because you were in a weird place.

1520
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,680
You were in a weird position at the time of DDR Freak Radio.

1521
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:09,240
And we can admit now, five years later, that a whole lot of this, this is the weirdest

1522
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:15,000
thing happened here, is that Iguana Girl and I used to be BFF, but then we had like a major

1523
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
falling out.

1524
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,240
And Iguana Girl and I didn't speak for like three years, seriously.

1525
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,480
It was pretty dirty.

1526
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,880
But the weirdest thing, and the reason why I can say that now is because we're cool now.

1527
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,240
You know, we don't hang out every day, but, you know, she's got her life, I've got mine.

1528
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:33,680
We used to understand, we had a treaty.

1529
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,000
We had a peace treaty signature.

1530
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Anyway.

1531
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,120
But the weirdest thing happened is that DDR Freak Radio started, like, and Orange Launch

1532
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,960
Radio, like both of us had the plans to do an online radio station.

1533
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:43,960
I didn't say anything.

1534
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,960
Yeah.

1535
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:45,960
And nobody, neither one of us kind of knew.

1536
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,840
And I knew both ends.

1537
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,600
So it was just kind of weird the way that happened.

1538
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,200
But regardless, why did we bring that up?

1539
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:55,480
Oh yeah, because we, I tried to promote a lot on DDR Freak, and some of the other Bamani,

1540
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:58,480
I can't remember if Bamani style even existed at the time, but some of the other DDR sites.

1541
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,480
Bamani style was around.

1542
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,480
Were they?

1543
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,640
Some of the other sites that were around at that time, we tried to promote the show.

1544
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,680
We had a whopping 15 listeners for the first episode.

1545
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:10,780
And pretty much, honestly, guys, for about the first three years of Orange Launch Radio,

1546
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:13,440
for about the first three years of Orange Launch Radio, I would say we were lucky if

1547
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,960
we pulled 40 listeners in the third year.

1548
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,160
And that's just the way live radio is, boys and girls, you know.

1549
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,320
A lot of folks don't, you know, live 365 kind of limits us a little bit.

1550
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:27,680
And the fact that it's, you know, live show, you know, some other people have better things

1551
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,560
to do Sunday night, which is understandable.

1552
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,420
But really, podcasting, audio blogging, whatever you want to call it, it really opened doors

1553
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:38,960
for us, because we were really fortunate to jump on that train before it really took off

1554
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,400
when iTunes incorporated podcasting in June of 05.

1555
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,280
And that was just really awesome for us.

1556
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:48,400
And now our listenership is, you know, I can say it's in the thousands.

1557
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,720
It's not like, we're not talking like 9,000, more like two or three thousand people that

1558
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,720
we have.

1559
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,720
We had the 4,000 week.

1560
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,520
Yeah, I mean, but you know, it doesn't, you know, whatever, it's just interesting that

1561
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,640
it's blown up so much, thanks to this podcasting thing.

1562
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,800
But for me, really not a lot has changed.

1563
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,040
The motivation continues to be, because we don't hear from all 4,000 of you.

1564
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,720
We appreciate the fact that you guys are listening to the show.

1565
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,640
Dear God, not all 4,000 people email me.

1566
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,640
We appreciate you guys listening.

1567
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,640
I think they should.

1568
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,640
And you know, we don't...

1569
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,640
We can check the email, how's that?

1570
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:18,640
Let me say this too.

1571
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,440
I got to try to wrap this up, because I don't want to.

1572
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:23,280
But we don't know if all 4,000 people are actually listening.

1573
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,900
There might be people that click on the file, but don't actually download it, you know.

1574
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:30,280
So we don't actually know exactly how many of those are actual, real listeners.

1575
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:34,460
We speculate we have about 1,800 real, actual people subscribing to the show.

1576
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:36,760
But anyway, that's regardless.

1577
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,560
You know, we don't hear from all those people on a real, regular basis.

1578
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:44,240
It's the chatters, it's the callers, it's the folks that send us emails, it's the people

1579
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:47,480
that reach out that really have kind of given us that motivation to keep going for the past

1580
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,480
five years.

1581
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,480
At least that's how I feel.

1582
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,280
I don't know about you guys, but that's really been what it is.

1583
01:19:52,280 --> 01:20:00,400
Well, I personally want to dedicate our success to the powers of the underworld.

1584
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,720
And that demonic pact you signed one day?

1585
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,520
Yeah, but I got my, they refunded me my soul.

1586
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,520
Loki, anything you want to add?

1587
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,520
I don't know.

1588
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,320
What keeps you motivated week after week to do this program?

1589
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,320
I'm motivated?

1590
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,320
You're an asshole.

1591
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,320
I'm motivated.

1592
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,520
Like on my live journalism, I'm motivated by spite and porn.

1593
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,520
Alright.

1594
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,680
I'm motivated by my non-video game addiction.

1595
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,680
Alright.

1596
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:28,240
Well, anyhow, so we're dedicating part B to you guys, the listeners, tonight.

1597
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:31,640
We're going to open up the Skype lines all night long and just kind of BS with you guys

1598
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,240
and just kind of talk about, you know, what you've been up to in gaming for the past five

1599
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,240
years.

1600
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,440
We're going to talk about, you know, your favorite gaming memories and just whatever

1601
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,880
question we feel like asking.

1602
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,520
Because also tonight, Dark Soccer and Loki don't know this, but usually I control the

1603
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,520
Skype phone calls.

1604
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,520
Oh no, not tonight.

1605
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,000
We're going to take turns answering the phone tonight, so Loki you actually have to pay

1606
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,040
attention tonight because we're all going to take turns answering the phone tonight.

1607
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,200
I don't like turns!

1608
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,200
Too bad.

1609
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,520
So we'll be back and who knows what could happen.

1610
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,040
It's going to be a very interesting part B on this, our five-year anniversary.

1611
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,920
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.

1612
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,200
You guys are awesome and you're the reason we're here.

1613
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,400
We'll be right back after this with more.

1614
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,780
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1615

Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
