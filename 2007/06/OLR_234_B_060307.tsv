487	19091	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19864	26986	And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this, our episode number 234 for June the 3rd of 2007.
28987	32908	We'll be celebrating our 5th anniversary on June 24th of this year, if you can believe it.
33249	36210	That's how we've hit so many episodes, if you wonder why 234 is a lot.
36230	39771	Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news.
39831	41691	Don't forget Orange Lounge Radio is in two parts every week.
41751	44712	If you missed some, be sure to go back wherever you got this episode.
45073	47033	Probably has part A linked as well.
47053	47853	Be sure to grab that.
48614	49454	Loki, why don't you start us off?
49790	51051	Toshiba DVD Drives TSH-943
79544	90054	That will allow you to play backup copies and legally purchased Xbox 360 titles, as well as it defeats all current and some future Xbox Live detection attempts.
90594	99562	So, because of that, it's actually allowing people to be able to use Xbox Live without them knowing that you have a modded console.
100243	103585	So, you know, fight the fight, I guess.
104026	104166	Yeah.
104741	112384	But Microsoft has always been, like, really good about fixing this kind of crap the second it comes out.
113024	114065	Sorry, I shouldn't say crap.
114105	115205	I mean, it actually is pretty smart.
115285	115925	But you know what I mean.
116286	118907	Like, you know, they put the banhammer on this stuff ASAP.
119367	121328	So, I mean, how long is this going to last?
121828	123228	Well, it depends.
123388	128290	I mean, we'll see how effective this stuff is, but that's big business for them.
128571	134533	I mean, if you look at Sony, they've tried and tried with the PSP, but there's no luck there.
135487	141750	and I don't know how much of DVD firmware they can really detect.
141770	146111	There's not really a lot that they can do, I think.
147552	152054	And if they circumvent the few methods that they have of checking, they might be screwed.
153274	157256	Unless they just do a whole hardware revision or something.
157316	158036	I guess we'll see.
158916	159277	I don't know.
159377	160877	What do you think, DarkSakura?
160897	161718	Do you think the
163325	168329	Hackers and Crackers will win in this war, or do you think Microsoft will be able to stay on top of them?
169811	178618	There's one thing that always works in favor of anyone who decides to system hack, and that's called system becoming obsolete.
179258	182021	They're not going to care if the next one's going to come out.
182301	183462	They'll say, well, screw the old one.
183942	186264	Everyone's like, yay, we win, because we held out.
187432	189633	So it's kind of like a, it's a waiting war, essentially.
190053	190294	Yeah.
190494	190874	Interesting.
191074	191274	True.
191494	210944	And, I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 2, you know, they had, granted, you know, the methods of, you know, doing swap discs and stuff like that, and the DVD loader and stuff, and now, you know, you have the whole running off of hard drives and stuff, and it's just like, shit, I mean, you don't have to buy anything for the PlayStation 2 anymore, you can download everything.
211224	213125	If people want it bad enough, they'll find a way.
213185	215927	I remember the days of the seven swap tricks.
216559	217640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
238226	240128	But I think that's fucked up to cheat in online games.
240148	241449	I think those types of people deserve to get banned.
241469	243550	I don't know if it's doing it for cheating in online games.
243590	246753	I think it's just not having to buy those $60 games is what they're doing.
248274	249155	Or maybe imports.
249635	250536	Imports might be nice.
251236	252698	That's kind of cool.
252818	255440	I don't agree with region control.
255480	256681	I understand why they do it.
257602	264647	I'm not trying to say it makes no sense because of licensing and all those other things for the music and what have you that they get in the games.
264727	266689	At the end of the day...
267699	269920	It sucks for the consumer.
269940	270520	You know what I mean?
272641	288188	Anyhow, something else that is confusing, nevertheless, for the consumers is that Destructoid ran this article earlier this week about the Xbox 360 and the fact that Metal Gear Solid 4 is confirmed for the Xbox 360.
288268	291429	Now, the article was kind of weird.
291489	292110	Actually, it's funny.
292150	294971	The guy who wrote it, Ron Workman, was actually on our year-end special
295670	298811	So I'm kind of wondering if we should call them up and try to figure out what's going on.
298871	302652	But I don't know if they'll talk because supposedly Konami sent out a cease and desist.
303392	308293	Now, Destructo has always been a pretty respectable site in my mind, so I don't think they'd pull these stories out of their butt.
308593	319836	So I'm just kind of wondering, like it was very interesting to kind of watch that happen where they had to be very vague about it and then they have this cease and desist coming from Konami which seems to cement it if that is legit.
319876	322057	I mean, I don't know, could the whole thing be an elaborate prank?
322177	323057	Who knows?
324226	329091	But Computer Game World seems to think so because they ran a counter story a little later on.
329111	330572	I'm sorry, that's Computer and Video Games.
330972	332033	Sorry, carried it to the wrong site.
332053	339599	Computerandvideogames.com ran a counter point a little later on in the week saying Konami's confirmed nothing is essentially what it's saying.
339920	342922	So saying that no, Metal Gear Solid 4 has not been confirmed for 360.
342982	343963	Konami's confirmed nothing.
344343	350128	But the weird thing about this report is that they're basing it on the fact that they've talked to Konami about
350376	378697	and Konami refuses to comment on the rumors and that they've made no statement regarding the 360 version and in my mind I kind of go well that's what we all I mean of course Konami's not going to say anything about it if they send a cease and desist to one site it's because they're not ready to comment on this trust us we know this very well okay that so it kind of doesn't mean anything to me that doesn't discount the story at all so I don't know well speaking of the rumor mill
379749	380890	and Konami, wow.
381810	393035	There actually were rumors that popped up in this month's issue of EGM stating that Silent Hill 5 was going to be a release this year and handled by Konami USA instead of in Japan.
393575	404240	But there was also an interview with the director, Tsubuyama Masashi, who, like I said, was the chief director on the project.
405280	409561	and he stated that they don't have anything official.
409822	414183	They actually were looking more next-gen console, multi-platform.
415623	419305	He did say to keep our eyes on the upcoming press conference on July 11th.
420445	421705	And that's during E3, isn't it?
422085	422285	Yep.
422626	423206	Boo!
423566	425767	So they'll probably be revealing Silent Hill 5 at that time.
426567	427187	Yeah.
427707	428147	Interesting.
429088	430068	Try to find my invite.
431803	432363	Well, I don't know.
432403	434504	As long as the series doesn't jump the shark, I'll be okay.
434544	437425	I think multi-platform is the way to go, though, honestly.
437985	441746	Because, you know, Xbox 360 still hasn't really cracked the marketplace in Japan.
442246	447548	I mean, obviously, I think most of us here would like to see it show up on 360, but over in Japan, you kind of have to put it on PlayStation 3.
447608	451809	The Wii is just probably not going to be able to handle what they're going to want to do graphically with the game.
452329	455070	You should have Silent Hill where you play as, you know...
455660	456821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
485237	486038	That's kind of cool, though.
486438	490221	Silent Hill Babies coming to ABC Family Saturday mornings.
492363	496546	Wonder Dog Harold says Pyramid Head Mysterious Dungeon would be a fun day.
496566	497447	That would be great.
498348	500009	With cutesy little music and everything.
501831	504713	Super chibi Pyramid Head, you know.
505954	507635	Aw, he just beheaded the cat.
510057	511078	That would be fantastic.
513500	514601	Anyways, um,
516613	517853	and other interesting stuff.
517953	546484	Coming out of the Halo 3 beta, there's been people actually hacking the beta to reveal all sorts of fun stuff, including they have a brand new chopper that you can ride in the game, the sword, as well as radar jamming items, player-operated turrets added to the wraiths, actually playing with the wraith
547086	553549	and different modifications including, you know, ground speed and gravity and all that sorts of stuff.
554069	557770	And pretty cool, I guess, that you can modify the beta to do that.
557870	561832	I can't believe people have already cracked the game and it's already in beta.
561872	563893	I mean, just imagine when the game actually comes out.
564753	568975	I'm not surprised they did this because people love their Halo almost a little too much, you know what I mean?
569695	569895	Yeah.
571076	571496	Well, there you go.
572413	583461	Also something to mention about Halo 3 is that GamePro is going to be running an article talking about that there are, you know, well actually I should say the article is going to be showing new vehicles, new maps, new weapons, and armor.
583941	587303	That's right, because Halo 3 is going to have armor in it, new armor.
587343	594688	You can create, or I shouldn't say create, but you can get armor for your characters, like new shoulder pads, new helmets, so that's kind of cool.
594748	601553	Like, I look at this one helmet on the particular scans from the site, it looks like an alien head or something on the helmet, so kind of neat.
602836	603496	Dead Rising Dead Rising, huh?
633287	638110	Dead Rising has some new costumes and themes for Xbox Live.
638750	643833	But the costumes are a white suit, a striped outfit, and an accountant outfit.
644513	647655	Yeah, because I really like to look like an accountant when I'm beating up the undead.
649455	650696	You know, I put on my suit.
652557	653237	You could.
653257	654758	One beheading.
654778	655939	Two beheadings.
656419	659000	Doesn't that game keep a body cage anyway?
659160	659681	Yeah, it does.
659941	660081	So...
661255	664556	I guess you can look the part when you're adding up the corpses.
666676	667016	Anyway.
667136	670817	And you can also dress up like an accountant and slam a cash register into them.
670857	672797	It's like, keep the change!
673777	674937	Office space the game.
675137	676998	Do they have a Naked Time costume in that game?
677538	678958	Like, you know, underoos or something?
679578	682699	They have really tight shorts that you can wear, little kid shorts.
683379	683899	I don't know about that.
683939	684659	That's a little scary.
685159	686459	You can run around as hard gay.
688620	689960	Beating up the zombies.
690359	690699	Hapitai
713212	721456	including some bills being passed regarding the ESRB ratings and selling minors M-rated games.
721956	735883	Apparently, the law has passed and it's going to make a felony, a Class E felony at least, the least severe felony in the state, if you sell a M-rated game to a minor.
736303	740185	So, better be careful before you sell those minors.
741014	742635	Mortal Kombat, Grand Theft Auto
771018	771298	That's all.
772878	773539	It's bullshit!
773759	774339	Right, DarkSakura?
774359	775559	Grandstanding is what it is.
776179	777039	It's stupid.
777239	777620	That's right.
777920	778580	It's stupid.
780340	780600	All right.
781180	784721	We're going to get into, and actually I'm looking at some comments in the chat room here.
785121	786902	Actdeft says, Law sucks in general.
787462	788062	Yeah, sometimes.
788882	797004	Ranma says, Unless New York State does a lot of secret shopping and or undercover sting operations, which they won't, this law will not fucking stick at all.
797704	800165	And Gerardimo says, Oh, I'm a New York minor.
800489	803630	But I only have a Wii, so I'm going to have a hard time finding an M game.
804910	807231	Scarface, Manhunt, Driver.
807251	809472	Yeah, but don't buy Driver.
809992	810232	Yeah.
811952	812753	Unless you want to laugh.
813433	813673	Alright.
813813	814453	It's a bad AI.
815273	822516	Well, folks, it's about time that we play a little bit of our favorite game to play here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
822656	825497	It's... The Match Game.
825677	826297	Ladies and gentlemen...
829071	831972	And we're going to open up the phone lines right now to get a contestant.
832012	835633	We have one contestant from the chat room, and we just need to get an opponent.
835693	840275	So if you'd like to give us a call, we'll take the first call on our Skype line.
840295	844096	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
844116	845217	You can call us either way.
846837	850239	And first off, we'll go around and introduce the special guest that will be playing tonight.
850279	852379	Loki, please help us introduce the guest tonight.
853400	857141	All right, and guest number one, your name.
860465	861725	And where have you come from?
865526	866126	Awesome!
866626	868086	That's very cool.
869027	870387	And guest number two, your name?
871547	872247	Miklatov.
874968	876409	Yes, I don't care where you came from.
876909	878489	Oh, where did you come from, Miklatov?
879709	880610	Galactica.
881850	884170	Hold on, we got a contestant call here, hold on.
884851	886091	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
887662	888702	It's Wonder Dog Harold.
888883	890003	Hi, Wonder Dog Harold.
890023	890984	How are you?
892104	893104	I'm fine.
893205	893645	You win.
893685	895165	You get to play match game tonight, okay?
895185	896826	Huzzah.
896986	897526	All right, all right.
897586	900888	So hold on the line while we introduce the rest of the panelists tonight, okay?
901688	914314	By the way, tonight, speaking of panelists, tonight's edition of the match game here on Orange Launch Radio, we had to do it tonight, dedicated to Mr. Charles Nelson Riley, who was from the 70s edition of the match game, which, you know, obviously we are,
914915	917936	We are blatantly ripping off the match game from the 70s.
918036	919377	You see the reruns on Game Show Networks.
919717	922938	He passed away this week and was one of the main reasons to watch that show.
922998	925599	He was awesome, so we're dedicating this edition to him.
925959	928680	So anyway, so yes, Rice, Princess, and Megalotop are here.
929040	935442	They are sacrificing some of their precious time away from watching Battlestar Galactica episodes back to back to back to be here.
935903	938704	Because you guys have watched, like, what, like seven episodes so far this weekend?
939264	939484	How many?
939504	939584	Yeah.
940433	942114	We have a lot.
942294	943915	We don't want to take up too much of your precious time.
943955	946477	So also joining us is Loki.
948338	949078	Yes, I'm here.
949218	949739	I know, of course.
949959	950979	And DarkSakura.
951860	952400	Rawr.
953120	954942	And me, because I'm awesome.
954982	956683	All right, so you have five folks tonight.
956903	958223	And WonderDogHerald's on the phone.
958243	958704	You still there?
959804	960004	Yep.
960145	960365	Good.
960665	963366	And he's going to be playing against HitStun from the chatroom.
963446	966308	HitStun from the chatroom won our drawing during the break.
966548	968369	Okay, now, WonderDogHerald, do you know how the game works?
969510	969630	Yep.
969932	972734	Okay, we're going to, for those that don't, I'll just explain it again.
973274	977397	We're going to be asking some questions, and we're going to put in the blanks.
977997	982860	There's blanks at the end of them, and you are supposed to come up with what you believe belongs in the blank.
983440	986602	And if you match with anybody in the studio, then you get a point.
987223	987503	All right?
987743	990645	So, we only have three questions tonight, though.
991185	992206	It's a short game tonight.
992666	993366	Are you ready to play?
994967	995368	Yeah.
995828	996168	All right.
996568	997889	Are you ready to play, Wonder Dog Harold?
998890	999010	Yep.
1000439	1002559	Question 1.
1005041	1007642	Rob just landed himself in big trouble.
1008462	1014665	When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card was declined.
1015445	1023429	Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, Rob, we turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much blank.
1035157	1038239	All our guests are thinking about their answers and writing them down.
1039119	1042821	Rob, we've turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much blank.
1044202	1044582	Okay.
1046123	1046483	All right.
1047503	1047963	Ding.
1048244	1048564	Ding.
1048584	1049224	We have some dings.
1049544	1049984	Dingy.
1051185	1051665	Yeah, we're done.
1053026	1053386	All right.
1054887	1055267	All right.
1056588	1058429	I'm waiting for the... Okay, there we go.
1058909	1059449	And all right.
1061090	1062571	All right, you got an answer, Wonder Dog Herald?
1062611	1062931	You ready?
1062951	1063051	Ready?
1066017	1066697	He's still thinking.
1066957	1069158	Alright, while you're thinking... Alright, here we go.
1069178	1071299	I'll read the question one more time, then we're going to go to you for an answer.
1071319	1071559	Here it is.
1072079	1074240	Rob just landed himself in big trouble.
1074740	1079101	When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card was declined.
1079542	1086304	Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, Rob, we turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much... What do you think, WonderDog?
1086324	1086604	Porn.
1087084	1088765	Porn, says WonderDog Harold.
1088845	1089785	Too much porn.
1090346	1091006	Hit stun...
1091946	1097910	also said porn, so this isn't going to be a very exciting round because if anybody gets porn, they both get a point.
1098171	1098611	That's all right.
1098651	1100893	Let's see what our celebrity panel came up with.
1101233	1102954	We'll start with Rice Princess.
1103475	1104555	He's been buying too much?
1105436	1107117	Silent Occupied Caprica.
1107658	1110300	Too much Silent Occupied Caprica.
1110320	1111300	Is that a match?
1112141	1113702	No, that would not be a match.
1113742	1118185	That's something from Battlestar Galactica, actually, and we are playing video game match game now.
1118846	1119146	All right.
1119764	1126168	Miklatov, he's been buying too much... Because porn is such a totally video game related thing.
1127428	1131951	He's been buying too much Helo, which is like Halo, but Helo.
1132131	1133252	That would be porn for me.
1133412	1136013	Another Battlestar Galactica reference.
1136093	1137214	Thank you very much for that.
1137254	1138014	Too much Helo.
1139135	1144398	Not a match, though, even if that is the object of Shane's fantasies we don't need to hear about on the show.
1144838	1147980	Loki, he's been buying too much... Actraiser.
1148590	1149691	Actraiser.
1149851	1150672	Good guess.
1150953	1153055	Loved it so much he had to buy it five times over.
1153115	1155017	Yes, to put it in the top five.
1155037	1156178	He bought it for all of his friends.
1156278	1156858	Actually, there you go.
1156878	1159021	Filled up one whole page of Actraiser.
1159041	1159761	Oh, I should do that.
1160742	1162564	DarkSakura, he's been buying too much.
1162704	1163125	Propel.
1163585	1164446	Propel.
1164606	1165747	I haven't used it in ages.
1165867	1166528	I know, Propel.
1166608	1167969	I actually drank some Propel today.
1168430	1169071	Was it good?
1169091	1169591	Mm-hmm.
1169891	1170352	Wow, Rob.
1170372	1171133	It's like fitness water.
1171173	1171413	It's good.
1173429	1177372	Rob, we turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much candy.
1177512	1178272	Because I'm fat.
1178533	1179093	Candy.
1179613	1180114	Sorry.
1180814	1181415	There you go.
1183016	1183596	So there it is.
1183756	1185858	No matches for either contestant that round.
1185918	1186598	Sorry to say.
1186698	1187719	Sorry, WonderDogHerald.
1190541	1190621	Aw.
1190741	1193543	That was very emotive.
1193583	1194003	I like that.
1194283	1196585	You ready to get some points on the second question?
1198987	1199307	Sure.
1199527	1200328	Alright, here we go.
1202657	1204658	That's what I like, some excited contestants.
1204698	1205158	Here we go.
1205658	1207239	Question number two.
1208839	1212440	Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort.
1212540	1212881	Liar.
1213461	1215962	But she's been very... It's a game, Jamie.
1216022	1216502	Play along.
1217002	1226025	Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but she's been very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts she's seen on game blogs lately.
1226225	1229606	Because, you know, they have the little coasters that have Zelda pictures and stuff.
1229986	1231487	Just go to Kotaku or something, you'll see it.
1231892	1234993	I should be very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts she's seen on game blogs lately.
1235433	1243195	She joined a community college class on knitting, but got kicked out of the class when her first project she brought in was blank.
1247836	1255758	She joined a community college class on knitting, but got kicked out of the class when for her first project she brought in blank.
1255778	1259820	Alright, uh, Ding.
1260600	1260800	Ding.
1260840	1261160	Ding.
1262452	1262892	Dang.
1263492	1264513	All right.
1265293	1265793	All right.
1268094	1271735	I'm just waiting for our chat room player.
1272755	1275115	And hopefully our phone player has thought of an answer, too.
1276676	1278216	The chat room is helping out.
1280417	1280837	All right.
1284938	1287539	Wow, one of these answers is an incredibly poor taste.
1288399	1288699	All right.
1289819	1291740	I usually are nobody.
1292521	1293322	Alright, here we go.
1293762	1294202	Here we go.
1294402	1295163	Is everybody dinged?
1296283	1296583	Alright.
1297764	1298324	Alright, here we go.
1298404	1298785	Here we go.
1299925	1305929	Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but she's been very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts she's seen on game blogs lately.
1306289	1313433	She joined a community college class on knitting, but got kicked out of the class for when her first project she brought in... Wonder Dog Harold?
1314974	1316655	A sweater with Clark Gay on it.
1317023	1318764	A sweater with Hard Gay on it.
1318864	1319204	Okay, good.
1319445	1322487	He's been paying attention to the show because Jamie's been watching Hard Gay.
1322527	1323027	Okay, good.
1323107	1323527	Good answer.
1323947	1324908	But we'll see if it matches.
1325188	1327430	HitStun said a shotgun.
1327570	1328971	She brought in a shotgun.
1330011	1331192	Which might be... Too soon.
1331452	1332213	Too soon.
1332253	1332733	A little bit.
1332753	1333253	But all right.
1333313	1334054	That's the answer.
1335115	1335455	All right.
1335935	1336796	Rice Princess.
1337256	1341398	She brought in... She brought in a Cylon Occupy Caprica.
1344400	1345201	Unfortunately...
1345876	1364144	Cylon Occupied Caprica is not a match and is still a Battlestar Galactica reference Rice Princess, we are playing video game Candy is not video games either, so shut up Nintendo Cereal was candy There's a Battlestar game coming out, so take that Will it have Cylon Occupied Caprica in it?
1364164	1374908	Probably Alright, here it is For her first project, she brought in Hilo Guys, you know what your next answers have to be, right?
1376502	1377483	Possibly.
1380727	1384030	This, by the way, will be the last appearance of Rice Princess Miklatov on our show.
1384090	1384971	Say goodbye, folks.
1385172	1385772	It's been fun.
1386213	1387254	It's been a fun five years.
1388555	1390858	It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down.
1391278	1391619	All right.
1393441	1398126	Loki, she brought in... The corpse of Charles Nelson Reilly.
1401502	1402423	Too soon!
1402523	1403383	Too soon!
1403463	1404803	In my refrigerator, hi!
1404963	1409065	She brought in the corpse of Charles Nelson Reilly to her knitting class?
1409185	1410165	That's horrible!
1410505	1415747	She needed a reference, you know, a lifelike reference of knitting his corpse.
1416107	1418688	DarkSakura, she brought in... A Glock 37?
1419688	1420168	A Glock 37?
1421549	1422409	Too soon!
1422489	1422969	It's a gun!
1423009	1424430	Don't you watch the news?
1424710	1424970	No.
1425130	1428691	You are not supposed to make guns at college jokes, that's not cool.
1429477	1431678	If you don't make fun of it, how will you ever recover?
1431698	1432358	All right, true.
1432378	1433898	Hey, it's a half of a match, though.
1433978	1435579	Is a Glock 37 a shotgun?
1435699	1436339	I don't think so.
1436439	1438759	No, but it's a firearm, so it gets to have a blink.
1438899	1439860	No.
1440280	1440460	No.
1442000	1443621	No, porn and Hilo are not a match.
1443661	1445381	Neither is shotgun and whatever Jamie said.
1446501	1446861	All right.
1447621	1448902	But it's a powerful gun.
1449302	1453263	GS191 says, does this mean I can call Loki a nappy-headed hoe, then?
1453843	1454223	I don't know.
1454363	1454623	Maybe.
1455043	1455583	He kind of is.
1456164	1457704	My hair is not nappy.
1458633	1459914	The chatroom calls for half a point.
1460214	1460494	Alright.
1462076	1463877	No, that's nice for the chatroom.
1463897	1464758	Too bad it's not their game.
1465179	1465939	Alright, anyway.
1467441	1474327	I said that she brought in, because it was a knitting class, she brought in a quilt with Pyramid Head raping a corpse.
1477210	1477750	Alright.
1477870	1481133	I know you don't make quilts in knitting class.
1481294	1483095	That's why they kicked her out, stupid!
1484346	1486767	Well, my other answer was going to be Bloody Steel Needles.
1486867	1490949	Actually, Pyramid Head was raping Charles Nelson Reilly's corpse, so go figure.
1491710	1492430	With a shotgun.
1493390	1495311	That would not be attractive.
1496052	1496372	All right.
1496392	1497632	That would be attractive, Rob.
1498033	1499613	So, Wonder Dog Harold, I'm very sorry.
1499653	1500754	You still have a zero.
1502235	1502355	Ow!
1502915	1503195	Shit!
1503495	1504036	That hurt.
1504856	1507337	And Dark Sakura just injured herself, so at least you get that.
1507357	1509438	No, I injured my laptop and indirectly injured myself.
1509698	1509978	All right.
1511219	1513140	Wonder Dog Harold, are you going to get a point on this last one?
1519345	1526107	Loki was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fanime.
1526867	1529768	He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.
1530648	1532608	He said to himself, that's it.
1533268	1535949	Next year I'm coming dressed as blank.
1543925	1546447	He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.
1546987	1550289	He said to himself, that's it, next year I'm coming dressed as blank.
1552710	1558153	Alright, ding!
1558173	1560195	Yeah, ding?
1560755	1561135	Dingy.
1561155	1562936	Alright, I'm waiting on the chatroom.
1563336	1564317	Sir Dingly Dang.
1564817	1566638	Alright.
1566839	1569140	No extrovert, you're too late, you can't play now.
1570287	1570807	Ding.
1571087	1571908	I want a ding.
1572028	1573709	I want to do a bonus point.
1574149	1576430	You can't do a bonus point.
1577731	1578071	Fine.
1578211	1579832	Extrovert wants to be a bonus point.
1579952	1580292	Fine.
1581293	1581513	All right.
1581533	1582653	Yeah, I think we got an answer.
1584454	1584654	All right.
1584674	1585034	There we go.
1585054	1586955	All right.
1586975	1587716	There's the end of the music.
1587736	1588576	All right.
1588596	1588996	Here we go.
1590617	1593579	Loki was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Faname.
1593879	1596100	He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.
1596160	1597421	He said to himself, that's it.
1597501	1600042	Next year I'm coming dressed as Wonder Dog Harold.
1601246	1601606	Hilo?
1602167	1602827	Hilo!
1603327	1604968	Says... Okay.
1605208	1607430	All right, so I see the tactic you're taking here.
1608070	1609431	All right, well, let's see if it's a match.
1609491	1610291	Rice Princess.
1610572	1611212	Wait, I have the microphone.
1611452	1612853	Who's the other guy?
1612893	1613293	Oh, I'm sorry.
1613333	1613914	Oh, yeah, that's right.
1613934	1614774	Hitsun, sorry.
1615134	1620117	Hitsun said, I'm coming dressed as Miss World 96 Nude.
1621038	1621618	Good answer.
1621718	1622118	Good answer.
1622158	1622819	All right, let's see.
1623019	1623279	Sure.
1623419	1625460	So we have Hilo and Miss World 96 Nude.
1626181	1626541	Let's start.
1626581	1628102	Rice Princess was number one, though, so...
1629498	1631259	Fine, Miglatov, what was your answer?
1631399	1631920	My answer?
1632500	1634001	Cylon-occupied Caprica.
1635983	1640647	Are you doing this just to screw with our... No, we had already planned that out.
1641027	1643469	Rice Princess, what did you say?
1643649	1648873	Next year I'm coming dressed as... Answer.
1650275	1650735	Gaeta.
1651656	1652116	Gaeta?
1652596	1653217	Gaeta.
1654218	1656700	He's in the CIC in Battlestar.
1658695	1666759	Lieutenant Gaeta You guys totally screwed Wonderdog Harold out of a point I had already planned mine Wonderdog Harold, would you care to yell at our celebrities?
1668379	1681265	Somebody could still say Hilo Alright, here we go That's true, somebody could still say Hilo Loki, he decided to come dressed as I was just going to say myself I don't cosplay, fuck this shit
1682997	1683838	I don't cosplay.
1683898	1684598	Fuck this shit.
1684639	1685239	It's not a match.
1685279	1685960	I'm sorry to say.
1686500	1688341	DarkSakura, he's going to come dressed as?
1688722	1689702	Hadoukei!
1691484	1692484	Hadoukei!
1692685	1693445	Also not a match.
1694066	1696808	And I said, next year I'm coming dressed as?
1697168	1698129	Hello, obvious.
1698509	1699230	Tingle!
1700130	1703213	Hello, he's coming dressed as Tingle for finally the OLR fans.
1703753	1704313	Could be happy.
1704794	1705754	And, uh, fine.
1705875	1707075	Extover wants a bonus point.
1707856	1708917	Let's see if there's a match.
1708957	1710238	You could decide the game right here.
1711227	1714530	I'm going to come dressed as... I was going to say Hot Dog.
1715991	1717392	Oh, from Battlestar Galactica.
1722456	1723477	I fucking hate this show.
1726099	1727780	Alright, so there it is.
1727920	1730162	Unfortunately, nobody won.
1730182	1731703	Yay!
1731823	1733385	HitStun got zero.
1733425	1734005	That means we win.
1734165	1736627	And WonderDogHerald, I'm sorry to say, you got zero as well.
1737328	1738669	So you have to give us money.
1738769	1739690	Can I say something?
1739850	1740070	Yes.
1740979	1743320	My dog's been lost for two days and they found her.
1744341	1744861	In one piece?
1745221	1745481	Yes.
1745601	1745922	Good.
1746002	1746602	So yay.
1746702	1747202	Woo.
1748543	1749323	Everybody be happy for me.
1749363	1750604	I'm glad the bitch is okay.
1750784	1752565	I was really depressed for two days.
1752825	1753205	All right.
1754906	1761389	Wonder Dog Harold, as a consolation prize, I'll let you plug any website or something you want to give a plug to here on air.
1761409	1763530	Nope.
1766408	1768449	You're a man of many words, Wonderdog Harold.
1768489	1769169	I appreciate it.
1769209	1771971	Thank you for calling in and being a contestant tonight.
1773172	1773572	Alrighty.
1773872	1774813	Alright, take care.
1775853	1776674	Bye-bye.
1776754	1777094	Bye.
1779075	1779996	That was great.
1780176	1781296	We need to have you on the show more often.
1781336	1782997	Wonderdog Harold said like ten words.
1783037	1784558	It's like when Miklatov guests on the show.
1784578	1785839	He says ten words the entire show.
1785859	1787300	You need to be in studio.
1788261	1789421	And we'll see if you speak more.
1789921	1790242	Alright.
1792679	1794159	All right, so we had 0-0.
1794479	1795420	Everybody is a loser.
1796200	1798040	HitStun says, the chat failed me.
1798080	1798620	They're fired.
1799660	1803761	HitStun says, you know, I can challenge WonderDogHerald at Tetris DS or Mario Kart or something.
1804962	1806882	I know the chat room was screaming tingle.
1807042	1807742	It would have been a point.
1808622	1809943	All right, that's it for Match Game.
1810583	1814704	And at this point, I will now kick out all of the guests because... It's hot in here.
1814924	1816704	Obviously need to go watch Battlestar Galactica some more.
1816724	1817604	Give us some ice cream, though.
1818864	1819545	I want ice cream.
1819565	1820405	Are you guys going to get ice cream?
1820425	1820965	Get milkshakes.
1821025	1821165	No.
1822133	1822873	I don't want to get ice cream.
1822893	1823514	You guys get ice cream.
1823534	1824534	You can give me a milkshake.
1826055	1828356	Or we can go get ice cream and not bring any back.
1828716	1829257	How about this?
1829397	1832398	Okay, we'll let you guys take over the afterbirth while we go get ice cream.
1832438	1832878	You want to do that?
1832898	1838281	Can we make our own cage match?
1838341	1839242	No, I don't think so.
1839362	1839682	Damn it.
1840062	1840903	I put in an awesome song.
1840923	1841523	Well, think about it.
1841863	1843664	Alright, think about it and give it back to me.
1844164	1846425	Alright, I know.
1846445	1848326	It'll just be a theme from Battlestar Galactica.
1848346	1849487	Sigh.
1850373	1852134	You can let me do it and it'll all be Doctor Who.
1852495	1855697	Alright, well, tonight's match game was a colossal failure.
1855717	1858039	Because Doctor Who is cooler than Battlestar Galactica!
1859840	1861041	I don't know about that.
1861461	1862362	It is a pretty good show.
1862402	1863302	Don't egg them on.
1863503	1864663	Yeah, seriously, don't encourage them.
1865124	1867185	Alright, let's talk about porn.
1867966	1868626	Yay!
1868686	1870007	Can I get a yay for porn?
1870047	1871208	Yay!
1871228	1874931	Well, actually, this isn't real porn, but it's Leisure Suit Larry, which is kind of like, you know,
1875322	1876763	Leisure Suit Larry is coming to mobile platforms
1906822	1911045	Larry fans worldwide have a strong allegiance to the classic Leisure Suit Larry adventure game format.
1911365	1913987	We are delighted to be doing just that with the mobile version.
1914347	1921432	We've kept the iconic Larry humor and attitude intact while adapting the graphics, language, and controls for a mass market global audience.
1921832	1925915	So there you go, some pixelated JavaScript titty coming to a cell phone near you.
1928140	1954934	and if you want your titties to be more realistic then Dead or Alive the movie is coming out June 15th and well it's going to be about as deep as Mortal Kombat the movie probably less deep but it will be coming out to theaters and there will be lots of chicks fighting and I know there's one scene with a chick fighting
1955612	1962257	Topless, but of course, you know, this is... Is this because you've already watched the whole movie on Google Video when it was out a while ago?
1962757	1966400	No, but I downloaded the PSP version of it off of Google Video.
1967320	1967921	That's good.
1968501	1983171	Well, speaking of things that have no depth, SingStar 90s is... Oh my god, why are people still playing... You know what, the SingStar games don't look that bad.
1983412	1984412	Oh, I played it at E3.
1984472	1984572	Yeah.
1985914	1987676	And I had to do Motorhead.
1988658	1990961	I'm more excited.
1991181	1996868	Heaven forbid I'm saying I'm excited about a PlayStation 3 game, but I think SingStar will be better on the PlayStation 3 we can download.
1996888	2000433	So that way you don't have all these freaking CD expansion packs, right?
2000473	2003136	Well, thank you for reading my story for me.
2003196	2004538	I haven't said anything about what it is.
2005373	2016160	Well, what I was going to say is that there actually is some speculation that for the PS3 SingStar there would be some more data for download via the download service.
2017060	2024284	But actually SingStar 90s actually was announced for New Zealand stores for August 3rd.
2025665	2026926	What kind of songs are in this game?
2026966	2027646	Is there a song list?
2028667	2030268	There's a gallery.
2030928	2031769	Oh, here's a song list.
2032595	2039897	Never Ever, All Saints, Barbie Girl, Love Shack, One Week, Achy Breaky Heart with a big fat typo on the page.
2039917	2040837	This game already fails.
2041917	2042497	Unbelievable.
2042537	2043478	Hey, that was a good song.
2044218	2045478	Here Comes the Hot Stepper.
2045498	2047479	It has Stay on it.
2048059	2048339	Really?
2048379	2049379	By Shakespeare's Sister?
2049819	2050599	No, Lisa Loeb.
2050659	2051180	Oh, damn it.
2052040	2054960	You Can't Touch This, Bitch, which I don't like that song at all.
2055601	2056281	Moving on up.
2056681	2057081	Torn...
2058092	2058773	Step by Step.
2058793	2059813	Oh, New Kids on the Block is on it.
2059833	2060434	That's cool.
2060674	2061895	This game might be interesting.
2061995	2063336	Dude, Where the Wild Roses Go.
2063396	2064517	I fucking love that song.
2064697	2065758	Is that the Nick Cave song?
2065838	2066398	And Kylie.
2066518	2067899	Wow, that's kind of cool.
2068500	2069481	It has Poison on it.
2070601	2071082	Wannabe.
2071102	2072683	I wonder if that game will come out in the U.S.
2072803	2073083	with that.
2073103	2073944	Dude, Radiohead.
2075025	2076866	It's got one of the Spice Girls.
2077947	2080749	It has Savage Garden, Kiss from a Rose, Baby Got Back.
2081029	2081550	That's funny.
2083391	2084752	Yeah, Zombies on it.
2085618	2087438	Dude, he's got the cure.
2087719	2091859	I'm getting this game.
2091919	2092260	Let's see.
2093120	2095600	Blackboy in our chatroom says, SingStar needs more Bjork.
2096321	2096681	I agree.
2098101	2102202	See, I do a great impression, don't I?
2109955	2111737	What was Margaret Cho's impersonation?
2112497	2116180	I'm sorry that I tried to eat your head.
2117541	2122585	By the way, there's this YouTube somewhere of, and I know we talked about it on the show before, but it's worth bringing up again.
2122625	2123206	It's that funny.
2123606	2129431	Where somebody took, because you know Bjork one time beat the crap out of some reporter in an airport in Thailand.
2129671	2133414	Well, somebody put Street Fighter graphics and music over it, and it's really funny.
2133474	2134455	It's on YouTube somewhere.
2134735	2136577	I'm sure one of the chatters will dig it up somewhere.
2137358	2137798	So there it goes.
2139877	2143600	Um, something else you can find on the internet is a role in a movie!
2145061	2145642	Amazing!
2147043	2151066	And, uh, but I don't know if you really want to be in this movie because it's an Uwe Boll movie.
2151886	2157610	Uh, he's actually auctioning off a role on eBay for a role in Far Cry.
2158031	2160172	The bidding started at 2,498 euros, which would translate to about $3,360 USD.
2166054	2169015	The winner would get five days on the set of the movie.
2169555	2173716	And unfortunately, though, they would have to cover the flight and the hotel.
2175176	2177157	So go figure that nobody bid on it.
2179417	2179917	Interesting.
2180497	2181478	If I had the money, I'd do it.
2182338	2182718	Why?
2183238	2183818	Because.
2185539	2186959	Because you're like, hey, look at that.
2187079	2188079	I was in that crappy movie.
2188479	2191220	Then I could say, I was in the movie and it fucking sucked.
2192185	2197149	The official eBay page is all in German, so it's kind of hard for me to make out, but it didn't sell.
2197169	2197990	It doesn't look like it sold.
2199931	2201112	Yeah, he sucks.
2202313	2205116	Thank you, Tigerclaw, for finding the Bjork Street Fighter video.
2206397	2206697	Awesome.
2208599	2213583	All right, well, stories about Uebol make us very angry, so you know what that means, boys and girls.
2213643	2216165	It's time for the FU's of the Week.
2229730	2230831	DarkSakura, start us off.
2232792	2233833	What makes me angry?
2234393	2237615	What makes me angry is the check engine light coming on on my car.
2239076	2247541	Because, well, we checked all the emissions, everything was clean, there was no problem with any of that, so I think it just needs new spark plugs.
2247601	2249282	But other than that, it was just really aggravating.
2251264	2254466	Oh, and one other thing, F you to office drama.
2256407	2258128	And new leather smell on my massage table.
2259710	2262272	Loki, any FUs of the week?
2262532	2270357	Yeah, FU to the key flash component to VGA thing I've got because it doesn't work.
2271537	2277821	At least it doesn't work like it should because, you know, my picture shouldn't be flashing on and off on the screen.
2277841	2279482	That probably would mean it's not working.
2280063	2283845	So fuck them and fuck you for wasting $50 of my money.
2285367	2291490	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm flying out to the East Coast in 48 hours and I haven't done any packing yet.
2292850	2294351	So FU to myself for not packing yet.
2295171	2296572	Maybe after tonight's show, we'll see.
2298173	2299713	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
2303735	2307516	Well, back to rumors and speculation.
2308617	2310658	There actually was a...
2312051	2318397	A little bit from Famitsu announcing that several Metal Gear Solid 20th Anniversary titles were supposed to be out.
2318857	2326844	So they've listed for the 26th of July Metal Gear Solid Collection for PlayStation, PS2, and PSP.
2328045	2331448	Also Metal Gear Solid 3 on PS2.
2333310	2335632	Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear Solid 2.
2336473	2337153	Did I just say that?
2337173	2338094	They listed it twice.
2338114	2338975	Okay.
2339713	2349042	There also is Metal Gear Solid for PlayStation and Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP re-releases, I guess.
2350183	2354027	Like, yay, you can just go to your used video game store and get them.
2356029	2357831	Are they going to redo graphics or anything?
2357851	2358671	It doesn't say anything.
2359072	2359352	Lame.
2360253	2362155	So it's just basically repackaged, repriced.
2362796	2362876	Yep.
2362896	2363076	Whoopie!
2387666	2397269	So, I wouldn't discount the fact that something else might come out with it to make it all kind of special, but it doesn't say anything yet.
2397449	2399990	So, I'm not going to put any stock until I get something official.
2402290	2406191	Well, something coming soon, or at least a rumor will be coming soon.
2406291	2412093	Tony Erickson, of course, the rumor's been going around saying that there's going to be a PSP phone coming soon.
2412762	2430073	Well, apparently there's been a patent that's been spotted on the US Patent website, and there's some pretty hard evidence there showing kind of a prototype of something that looks like a very thick phone that's going to have a rotatable screen, almost looks like a PSP, just a little bit thicker.
2431593	2432834	Very interesting, though.
2432914	2434035	Kind of the same stuff, I think.
2434397	2435237	This thing looks stupid.
2435317	2437158	It makes me think of the great phone taco.
2458305	2458986	The N-Gage?
2459926	2461647	I had a phone taco.
2461667	2462048	What?
2462088	2463069	You had an N-Gage?
2463469	2464389	I told you I had one.
2464450	2465550	They gave us one for free.
2465710	2466111	Loser.
2467552	2469213	It was free and we gave it away.
2469493	2470014	Cheap loser.
2470034	2472756	I'm just kidding.
2472776	2474417	Okay, so that's what it would be.
2474817	2475598	That makes more sense.
2475738	2484104	It looks like what would happen is you'd actually have your directional button and stuff like you'd normally have on a phone.
2484890	2490433	Um, and then that whole screen would flip around and then you would have kind of like a PSP looking thing.
2491874	2492375	It's neat.
2492515	2494136	I don't know if that would work very well.
2494276	2497097	It looks unwieldy and kind of crappy like the Blackberries do.
2498859	2499179	I don't know.
2499779	2501540	Just, you know, PSPs aren't that expensive.
2501560	2502941	Just stick with the PSP.
2503161	2504422	Turn the PSP into a phone.
2504582	2505022	There you go.
2505362	2507684	How about get a phone, get a PSP?
2507964	2512727	You know, I would rather have a phone that I can do two things on.
2513542	2514543	Number one, call people.
2514563	2515523	Number two, text message.
2515804	2516824	That's frickin' it.
2516864	2518425	That's why I paid 30 bucks for my phone.
2519006	2519866	And I have a nice phone.
2520947	2525029	But if I want to play a video game, then I'll just get something that's dedicated to video games.
2526390	2532694	I can take pictures with my phone, which is fine because I have a camera and all, but sometimes you can take pictures with your camera phone when people don't know it.
2533355	2535316	Okay, that would be a number three.
2535976	2536697	That would be a number three.
2537217	2541680	But seriously, this iPhone crap and this PSP phone crap, why don't you just...
2542438	2544559	Get a PSP or get an iPod.
2545620	2546240	How hard is it?
2546420	2547921	PSPs are pretty large, too.
2547941	2549622	I wouldn't really want to use it as a phone.
2549882	2553443	Now, if somebody gave me an iPhone, I wouldn't disagree.
2553584	2556105	Or if I got a big fat discount on one, I wouldn't disagree.
2556725	2561708	But it was not something that I think is worth $600 for, and neither would this PSP phone thing be.
2562688	2565369	I have a phone that works, and I have one PSP.
2566943	2595517	and I have a bunch of DS's so I can just play whatever you can probably buy a pretty nice phone for $600 I'd like to think my phone is pretty nice it was only $200 a year ago I could buy like a full GPS system with you know built in headphones to talk to anybody in the world for enough money but you know why would I want to do that I have my phone I think that all of this is ridiculous it's just because people are tech addicts and need to have something that does more than it needs to do
2597532	2601793	Alright, well, you know, on that PSP, you could play this.
2602213	2608494	Also being reported in Famitsu is that a new version of Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins is coming out for the PSP.
2609154	2612135	It's coming out in Japan, and they're redoing it.
2612775	2615875	It's going to be kind of making the game a little closer to its arcade roots.
2616696	2623637	The number of continues is going to be limited, and players will be forced to complete the game twice before seeing the ending.
2624057	2624317	So it
2624955	2628457	In other words, they've made this game even harder than it was before.
2629878	2630179	Wow.
2630979	2632000	It was pretty hard before.
2632640	2633301	So there you have it.
2633341	2634882	Ghosts and Goblins, it better be hard.
2635362	2638444	So August 2nd is the day the game is coming out.
2638524	2643708	No import plans announced yet for the game to come out in North America, but we can all hold our breath.
2645770	2646450	And maybe we'll get it.
2646790	2650613	But I'm sure it'll be dumbed down and made easy, just like most of the games they bring over from Japan.
2650653	2650953	Who knows?
2650993	2652314	Maybe we'll die first.
2653395	2653655	All right.
2654547	2656828	One more story, then we're going to get to our Skype line.
2656868	2660950	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can call us.
2661170	2662931	Orange Lounge Radio is our username.
2662951	2663791	I'm sorry, two more stories.
2664231	2666452	Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.
2667232	2668173	Two more stories, my bad.
2669293	2679537	Well, at any rate, you remember the whole Second Life exploitation that was going on?
2680838	2682038	Didn't we cover that last week?
2682058	2683219	Did it involve cock-throwing?
2684142	2684562	No.
2685963	2707540	Well, at any rate, a Pennsylvania attorney is taking Linden Labs to court because she's saying that they illegally took away the items that were supposed to have been acquired during, let me see the quote, allegedly acquired using an exploit by an SL user.
2708921	2713024	He was banned, lost everything, and the
2713832	2717553	Court actually is denying the request to dismiss the case.
2717593	2718893	They've denied it twice.
2721314	2725675	There's actually a big quote on here that says, The case will still need to play out and only concerns the sum of $8,000.
2725915	2734318	However, it appears that greater scrutiny and enforcement of commerce within Second Life and other virtual worlds is possible and may be necessary.
2734458	2741960	The commerce, largely characterized by pyramid schemes, faulty valuations, and unreal exchange rates could be subject to real-world law.
2743320	2743460	So,
2745285	2746386	That's when you make third life.
2747687	2749348	But second life is too real for you.
2749748	2750409	Go to third life.
2751209	2755452	So if someone steals all my equipment in World of Warcraft, I can like sue them over it?
2755472	2757954	That'd be kind of cool, I guess.
2758515	2758755	Maybe.
2760436	2760876	Interesting.
2762678	2766981	I'm suing you for vandalizing my building by throwing cocks at it.
2767481	2768001	Damn you.
2768702	2769522	Damn you to hell.
2769623	2771584	If someone threw cocks at me, I'd sue them.
2774029	2775970	I'm thinking I should sue these guys.
2776550	2777451	Codemasters.
2779212	2785615	They never seem to fail me when it comes to thinking up video game ideas.
2785935	2788276	They're creating Dirty Dancing, the video game.
2788657	2790417	Yes, that's right, Dirty Dancing.
2792178	2797781	Such a wonderful game, and I don't know what the hell they could be doing with this.
2798461	2803444	Neat idea if they pull it off, but I really wish they'd put this baby in the corner.
2805740	2807120	because it's kind of late.
2807140	2808041	They need to put her down.
2808321	2809001	They need to put her down.
2809401	2823824	But apparently it says working alongside a team at Kellerman's Resort playthrough, a fantastic variety of fun mini-games, earned camp dollars to purchase Dirty Dancing memorabilia, cabin furnishings, and all-important dance lessons with Johnny and Penny.
2824224	2827165	How will you fare in the end-of-the-season dance contest?
2828505	2833646	Didn't they already try bringing back the Dirty Dancing franchise with that Havana Nights movie or whatever it was that tanked?
2834600	2836961	I don't know if it tanked, but yeah.
2837961	2839102	I agree with WonderDogCarol.
2839122	2842043	WonderDogCarol says, I want Mannequin the video game.
2843544	2844284	Hell yeah.
2845104	2846625	With that one guy with the glasses?
2846665	2847585	What the hell was his name?
2848245	2852527	The really flamey guy in the movie that was like the assist... Oh, God.
2853687	2855348	I know somebody's going to yell it in chat.
2855368	2855728	I know it.
2857749	2858509	That's what I want to see.
2859029	2859890	Mannequin the video game.
2859930	2860290	That's great.
2862487	2864109	Dirty Dancing the Game, DarkSakura, Hollywood, BlackBoy
2882990	2885612	Alright, let's get to the Skype line, shall we?
2885652	2892296	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
2892376	2896059	The phones are now open for business, so give us a call.
2898360	2899481	We'll just sit here and wait.
2899641	2901402	Okay, great, we got some calls coming in already.
2901443	2903024	There's a little bit of a delay, so it takes a minute.
2903424	2905005	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
2905862	2908185	Yeah, you already know this Legend of Zaku.
2908225	2910687	Hey, Zaku, how you doing?
2910707	2915913	What do you think about, now I know you're into cell phone games, what do you think about Legion Suit Larry on the mobile phones?
2917034	2927645	Um, I haven't seen it yet, but I would assume it has to be, you know, it has to be like text and graphics based, where you just have to like, you know, it's like basically text and images based.
2929823	2935545	It's basically the whole... It's just the whole premise of cell phone games just to garner the casual gamer's attention.
2935585	2938546	But yeah, if it works out, that's great.
2938686	2940367	Maybe some pixelated boobies, who knows?
2940527	2942728	Anyway, what did you call in about tonight, Zaku?
2943868	2950791	Um, you know, just random stuff like the fact that, um... I forgot what I was going to say, um...
2952645	2960688	Yeah, it's like, I don't know, just getting, you know, about Tekken 6 and the fact that, you know, all the rumors about it going to 360.
2962129	2966871	You know, just in general of how the state of affairs is with, you know, with trying to make games.
2968352	2971613	We're starting to lose exclusives because everything's going multi-platform.
2973013	2977755	Let me ask DarkSakura a little bit about this because you're right, we didn't talk about Tekken 6 tonight at all.
2977795	2978976	It just kind of missed our show role.
2979329	2981031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2999884	3001525	It'll look a little bit better, play a little bit better.
3001545	3004346	And that and Namco has just been all about Sony.
3004506	3006748	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
3006828	3009289	But then you also have Ace Combat 6, which is 360.
3009789	3015652	It's a time exclusive, which the PS3 version will come afterwards.
3015692	3016793	So it's kind of like the inverse.
3017093	3021475	It probably also helps that the Tekken 6 arcade hardware is built off the PlayStation 3.
3022015	3025537	So it's probably pretty simple to port it over to the PlayStation 3.
3025577	3027999	It might take a little longer for Xbox 360, but...
3029252	3029973	They're not dumb.
3030053	3033036	Obviously, they're going to put it over on the 360 at some point.
3033897	3041284	And if you looked at the recent Mini E3, you know, lineup list that they had, apparently, you know, I don't know.
3041344	3046749	It's just like all I see is like very few exclusive, you know, PS3 games from other companies.
3047109	3050453	I mean, obviously, Sony's the only one making their own PS3 games.
3050593	3051474	Well, who knows, though?
3051494	3053275	Sony may have some surprises in store.
3053315	3053836	You can't really...
3054116	3060940	I mean, usually the announcements about what we're going to see at E3 is shit we already know about that was delayed from last year.
3061361	3069065	So, you know, a lot of it's going to be surprises, but I'm assuming if E3 operates any similar way this year that it did last year, which I'm assuming will be the same thing.
3069085	3071467	Chances are it's going to be much smaller, much more closed.
3071567	3078231	Well, besides that, I mean, the way the news works, you know, I think that'll still kind of pretty much be the same.
3078251	3080412	The big boys who get in will have to feed off of them eventually.
3080692	3081473	Yeah, well, you know.
3083058	3085819	At some point, the rest of the internet will get fed up with it, but we'll just wait.
3086440	3089001	All right, well, anyway, Zaku, anything else on your mind before we take some other calls?
3089921	3090541	That's about it.
3091462	3094343	We New Yorkers have 2DX Happy Sky in the arcades.
3094603	3096344	Oh, where at?
3096404	3102487	Same place where we find the only pop music machine in the city, Peter Pan Games in Queens.
3102727	3104368	I might have to look that place up while I'm out there.
3104408	3104708	We'll see.
3105288	3105568	All right.
3105688	3106389	All right, later, Zaku.
3107049	3107249	Bye.
3108413	3113375	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3113415	3115036	Let's go to the phones and take another call.
3116816	3118957	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3118977	3119337	Who's this?
3119938	3121178	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.
3121378	3122439	Hey, Ranma, how you doing?
3122459	3123339	Hi.
3123919	3125000	Hi, everyone.
3125200	3126920	How'd you enjoy your trip out to California?
3127561	3128821	Oh, it was fucking awesome.
3128841	3129301	I loved it.
3129541	3130042	Seriously.
3130222	3131642	Yeah, we're having a hard time hearing you, Ranma.
3131662	3132683	Get a little closer to your microphone.
3133743	3135824	I said I had fun and I enjoyed it very much.
3136269	3139731	I like to somehow make my way out there for a weekend just to have fun.
3139771	3140932	We're a fun bunch here.
3140952	3142332	What do you want to call in and talk about tonight?
3142913	3145914	Well, one of the things everybody's been bitching on me about are pictures.
3146234	3150117	So, I'm posting a link in the chat room right now for the pictures.
3150997	3153198	Oh, do you have pictures of the panel and stuff?
3153859	3155119	I have a few pictures of the panel.
3155299	3155559	Nice.
3157160	3163024	It's djranmas.mypockybox.com My Pocky Box?
3163984	3164985	Yeah, mypockybox.com
3166394	3169175	forward slash gallery forward slash Fondame 2007.
3169775	3171796	Awesome.
3172916	3174356	I'm looking at some of the pictures right now.
3174396	3176117	You got tons and tons of cosplayers.
3176417	3177978	What was some of your favorite cosplay you saw?
3179038	3189941	Actually, I don't have to be biased, but I was really going for the Ranma 1.5 cosplays because there's been a while where not many people are cosplaying that series, but now lately, this is making one hell of a comeback.
3191141	3192802	The series is kind of old, though, right?
3193502	3196043	Yeah, but great series like that never go old.
3197193	3203915	Now, you know, one of the favorite pieces of cosplay I saw was actually Jonas, who's been on OLR before.
3204015	3204975	He's been on this program before.
3205255	3206795	He cosplayed as a Wii remote.
3207335	3208176	That was him?
3208516	3209096	Yeah, that was him.
3209636	3210676	That was awesome.
3210956	3217478	He was actually going to come to the show tonight, but I don't think he got the address in time of where we're at now, because we've been in like four different studios.
3217518	3218638	He hasn't been on the show in a long time.
3218938	3220959	But yeah, that was one of my favorite pieces of cosplay.
3221899	3223319	Oh my god, there's the Dolphy pictures.
3224860	3225920	Oh, there's the OLR panel.
3225960	3226260	Here we are.
3227034	3229575	Oh, Sky, who are you choking in this picture?
3230656	3231136	Which one?
3231156	3231537	Let me look.
3232237	3232877	Number 124.
3233097	3233758	I just posted it.
3234718	3235219	I'm going to look.
3236800	3238140	Who am I choking in this picture?
3238200	3238901	That's Drew Nami.
3239881	3241662	I thought Drew Nami was on the other side.
3241922	3242603	No, that's Drew.
3244164	3244684	Oh, that's cool.
3244704	3247045	You got a bunch of Orange Lounge Radio listeners there.
3247085	3247505	That's cool.
3247686	3248086	I like that.
3248186	3248726	Definitely.
3248906	3249447	Very nice.
3249487	3251848	One of my friends, Ken, he took the picture for all of us.
3253005	3260591	I didn't know you took a picture of my Dolphies on the table.
3261392	3263334	Yeah, you asked me to do it.
3263534	3265315	No, the one in the hotel room.
3266056	3266576	Oh, yeah.
3266716	3267837	Oh, I thought you knew about that one.
3268638	3269498	No, that's cool.
3269518	3270019	It's a good picture.
3271480	3271980	Oh, sweet.
3272000	3273862	All right, anything else you want to share with us, Ranma?
3274777	3278379	The last picture of you and William together in the chat room, the one that everybody loves.
3278819	3279719	Thank you very much.
3279739	3280459	That's very sweet.
3280559	3282100	Oh, God, is that in the gallery?
3282280	3283521	Are you putting personal pictures?
3284201	3284561	All right.
3284601	3286442	That's my trip picture still.
3287082	3292524	I see, because at the very end, oh, yeah, DarkSakura's pinball, all that stuff at her house, all the crazy pinball at her place.
3293245	3294085	There's my friend John.
3294145	3294625	How funny.
3296046	3299367	So I decided next year, though, that I'm going to do Lolita Mario.
3300888	3302808	Dude, the Gachamon cosplayers, that's great.
3303529	3303949	Of course.
3305595	3307396	Alright, well Ranma, thanks so much for coming out here.
3307436	3316982	You are a true fan, pretty hardcore, for coming out all the way to California to see the Orange Lounge panel and hang with us and go to Fatame and all that too, but you're just awesome, that's all.
3317608	3319948	Well, plus it was my birthday the day before.
3320308	3322749	This was a version of a giant birthday gift to myself.
3322889	3323509	Drew, that.
3323529	3325049	Well, happy late birthday a little bit.
3325349	3326150	And we'll see you.
3326230	3328670	I'll be seeing you this weekend, the coming weekend.
3328690	3329290	Yeah, definitely.
3329550	3334031	And I will be posting a post in the forum so we can get things cracking for that.
3334051	3337032	All right, just make sure it happens Sunday afternoon because that's the time I got.
3337292	3338072	All right, sounds good.
3338092	3338432	All right.
3338692	3338932	Later.
3339532	3339892	Later.
3340732	3342813	All right, let's go to some more calls.
3342953	3344553	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3344593	3344953	Who's this?
3346215	3347056	Raven Stolfen!
3347256	3349017	Hello, Raven Stolfen, what's on your mind?
3350358	3351258	Uh, Match Game.
3352059	3353019	Yeah, what about Match Game?
3354400	3368269	Well, I don't know if you realize, but in GSM, when they used to do Match Game online, and I was really good at it, and I got on the board on TV that said your name on it, I was heavily addicted to that for a long, long time.
3368389	3369550	Don't they still do that?
3370891	3373753	Yeah, but Comcast being dicks, they took off my...
3374198	3377220	took off GSN entirely down here, and I'm pissed.
3377900	3378720	Oh, that sucks.
3378780	3379681	So that's kind of cool.
3380001	3380561	Yeah, that's right.
3381202	3390767	We don't talk a whole lot about casual games on the show, certainly, but that's pretty cool that they have the, you know, you can play along with the game shows and stuff.
3390827	3391847	I've actually never done that.
3391907	3392508	I should sometime.
3392568	3394749	I love myself some game show networks, so there you go.
3396192	3406478	Yeah, but we cheated sometimes because some people watched it so many times they'd write down the answers and it was posted up in the chat room and we would get on the leaderboard every time.
3406658	3407099	It was great.
3407679	3408079	Awesome.
3408880	3410081	What else do you want to share with us tonight?
3411361	3413663	What else do I want to share with you tonight?
3413763	3414683	Let's see.
3415644	3416204	Not much.
3416244	3418226	I just want to point that out.
3421187	3422028	That's about it.
3422448	3423669	There's no one more thing tonight?
3425256	3427177	Well, I updated my website.
3427657	3428677	You want to hear about that?
3428837	3429437	Sure, why not?
3429517	3430498	Cheap website plug.
3430558	3430918	Go for it.
3430958	3431378	Make it quick.
3432558	3433999	Checkinggame.com.
3434059	3435920	Oh, I just remembered what I want to talk to you about.
3436020	3436480	All right, there you go.
3436500	3436660	What?
3436860	3437100	Sorry.
3438340	3440501	Hotel Dusk, Ring 215.
3442202	3444382	I don't know much about, well, I mean, I take that back.
3444482	3445503	I know about the game.
3445583	3451285	I haven't played the game because it's just one of those games that is, you know, I can't play every game that comes out.
3452065	3452605	What about it, though?
3454646	3456988	It's not like Phoenix Wright, but I enjoy it.
3457148	3458909	I thought it was very enjoyable.
3459450	3460550	What makes it so enjoyable?
3461952	3467016	Well, you play this guy called Kyle Hyde, and he goes to this place, and the room is magical.
3467116	3469618	So this room grants wishes.
3469758	3473741	So he goes in there, he doesn't know anything, and I'm not going to spoil anything.
3473801	3478225	So he goes in there, and he's trying to find something out about his friend.
3478585	3482048	So it's very interesting how all this comes together.
3483044	3483625	Interesting.
3483665	3488730	Well, I mean, I know Miklatov has the game, so I'll have to borrow it from him at some point and give a more fair review on the show later.
3490351	3499020	Yeah, it's very enjoyable, I thought, but there's a lot of reading, so for you people that hate Super Paper Mario, you're probably going to hate this too.
3499501	3501823	Do you hate Super Paper Mario because it's too much reading, Loki?
3503354	3503894	Interesting.
3531075	3533056	Alright, well, anything else real quick, Ranma?
3533196	3535478	Or, not Ranma, Raven's Dolphin.
3535498	3536738	I'm looking at Ranma's pictures in the background.
3537038	3538179	Anything else, Raven's Dolphin?
3538699	3539019	That's right.
3539800	3543122	Yeah, I just updated my website, and I just want people to know how it looks.
3543302	3545203	TechieGames.com Alright, there it is.
3545643	3547104	Alright, well, thank you so much for the phone call.
3547364	3548005	Have a good one, okay?
3548245	3548945	Oh, definitely.
3548985	3549205	Bye.
3549265	3549685	Alright, bye.
3550386	3555028	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3555689	3556789	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3556809	3557150	Who's this?
3558130	3559351	Hey, this is BlackDevilRx.
3559798	3561719	Hello, BlackDevilerX, what's on your mind?
3562860	3564421	Um, not much.
3566142	3567523	Um, I'm trying to get a Wii.
3570345	3571785	San Francisco seems to be out of Wiis.
3572446	3577189	You know what, so does Sacramento and a lot of areas seem to still be out of Wiis after all this time.
3577269	3579870	Matt, you can give us a distribution angle here, I suppose.
3579890	3580831	What the hell's going on?
3581251	3583593	There's still some coming in, it's just, it's slow.
3584113	3587315	It's still, everything's under, you know, allocations and everything.
3588103	3590305	Is there a particular time that's best to check?
3590385	3593268	Like Sunday mornings seem to be pretty good.
3593708	3596811	No, not really.
3597131	3602836	A lot of places are keeping them under wraps until Sundays when they put out their ads.
3602936	3603436	That's why.
3603977	3605458	For a lot of retail chains.
3606359	3608301	EB Games hasn't seen one for two weeks.
3609141	3610643	Wow.
3610683	3612785	Can you still do pre-orders with these guys?
3613305	3614266	Or do they not do that anymore?
3616458	3617099	I don't know.
3618199	3624523	I kind of hesitate to do stuff online because I kind of had a real bad experience with it, but I suppose that's one thing I could do.
3624903	3625203	Interesting.
3625484	3629346	James Patrick in chat says, My Toys R Us got 200 of them on Memorial Day.
3629706	3630867	I was there trying to get one.
3631247	3632668	Sold out in 30 minutes.
3633688	3634629	That's crazy.
3635169	3635870	My God.
3636150	3637150	After all this time?
3637250	3637731	Seriously?
3637891	3638131	Wow.
3639488	3643030	I guess that just goes to show, Wii's still a pretty darn successful system.
3643090	3643710	It's pretty amazing.
3643910	3644291	It's amazing.
3644351	3646732	I'm going to get one for myself, like, kind of as a graduation present.
3646932	3648673	Well, what have you been playing since you're Wii-less?
3650974	3653055	Actually, I've been playing a lot of Super Smash Bros.
3653095	3653716	on the GameCube.
3654256	3654796	Ah, there you go.
3655096	3657418	In anticipation for the new one on the Wii someday?
3657938	3658278	There you go.
3658298	3665662	What do you think about all the stuff they've announced on the site recently, like the musicians and the power-ups and all that, and using the GameCube controller?
3666277	3670059	I haven't actually checked out the site lately, but I've heard that Snake's going to be in there, which is kind of cool.
3671340	3672061	All right, very cool.
3672381	3674882	I hope they have more of those single-player type modes.
3674922	3678665	Remember how they had the old-school Mario level that you played Mario?
3678685	3679185	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3679225	3680406	That stuff was so cool.
3680726	3681486	I hope they have more of that.
3682587	3685929	All right, well, BlackDevilerX, thank you so much for the call, and good luck on your hunt for a Wii.
3686309	3687070	Try Sunday mornings.
3687090	3687970	That's the best advice we got.
3688451	3688711	All right.
3688871	3689491	All right, later, dude.
3689972	3690172	Later.
3691753	3692013	All right.
3692526	3700232	If you would like to give us a call, you can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
3700593	3707098	We'll take one more call here and then we're going to go ahead and call it a night on the Skype line and do some last minute stories.
3707618	3710641	Although it does seem to me it's been kind of a slow news week, huh?
3710661	3711582	A little bit.
3712442	3713083	Compared to usual.
3713103	3714944	Maybe it's because Memorial Day kind of got in the way.
3714964	3718167	A lot of folks, video game employees want to go camping too.
3718908	3719428	So there you go.
3720089	3720409	All right.
3720962	3721823	No other calls coming in?
3721863	3723344	I saw some others hitting on the line.
3723364	3724565	God, my pinball room is hot.
3725785	3726366	It really is.
3727346	3732550	And there's pictures of my garage with my amazing washing machine with my laundry in it.
3732590	3735012	There's pictures of my huge ass on there.
3735112	3736172	God, it looks horrible.
3738494	3739815	My ass doesn't look so bad in that picture.
3739835	3741336	You see that Rocky and Bullinkle machine?
3741496	3741776	Uh-huh.
3741816	3742597	That's mine.
3743317	3744158	That's an awesome machine.
3744218	3744518	I like that.
3744538	3747540	The Twilight Zone is mine, too, because the play board was made on my birthday.
3748081	3749902	Now, I wish they would have gotten a shot of the...
3750851	3752212	Hey, Dark Knight, it's just a timing thing.
3752252	3759956	I saw that there were a bunch of people trying to get through, and then nobody for a minute and a half, and we're sitting here going...
3779594	3780935	While you got through, what's on your mind, buddy?
3782096	3788902	I thought I wanted to talk about something I posted on the website recently about a price cut of Lumenfall's next-gen system.
3789623	3789903	Okay.
3792845	3797169	I mean, I would think that I knew it was coming, but this early was kind of a shocker.
3797889	3799711	Being this early was kind of a big shocker to me.
3800512	3801052	Wait, what about me again?
3801072	3801973	Because you were breaking up a little.
3801993	3802974	You say price cuts?
3803654	3806757	Yeah, they said there might be a possible next-gen price cut.
3808039	3810741	What makes this information more substantial?
3811281	3817044	To be fair, it seems like every month we're getting some rumor of an upcoming price cut, and we have yet to really see a big one.
3818204	3826229	I mean, basically, the latest I got was that they said that Microsoft was going to go first at the end of the summer, and like a $50 drop.
3827395	3832420	I would honestly think Microsoft's in a safe place right now until Sony drops their... Well, I don't know.
3832480	3836023	Maybe Microsoft wants to try and get down there to compete with the Wii a little more.
3836063	3840407	Because honestly, if they dropped their core by $50, they'd be the same price as a Wii, right?
3840988	3842149	And that's what it was intended.
3843210	3846153	They wanted it to be at least the same price as a Wii, the core.
3846653	3847394	I don't see why not.
3847734	3848795	That seems to make a lot of sense.
3848835	3849636	What do you think, Loki?
3849676	3852619	Again, I want your angle on this because you're kind of on the inside in this.
3853126	3859568	Well, I don't think that they have any firm plans on dropping any price, but obviously they're probably going to be ready to if other companies do it.
3860068	3863789	But some console makers are probably going to have to drop the price of their system.
3864049	3866950	But then again, all these analysts just saying, oh, there's a price drop coming.
3867010	3868771	Yeah, there's a price drop coming eventually.
3869111	3872092	And they're just trying to get out there and say, hey, see, we called it.
3872652	3874732	We're really good at analyzing stuff.
3874812	3875433	Look at us.
3875673	3876433	I would say...
3876886	3878686	Because we're analysts, too, of sorts.
3878946	3881747	I mean, really, what do we do on this show for the past five years, right?
3882167	3886748	So I would say if a price cut's coming, it's going to be just before the Christmas rush.
3887088	3890748	So I would say, honestly, price cuts, I think end of summer's a good call.
3891148	3891629	September.
3891989	3894189	I would say you're going to see some massive price cuts in September.
3894649	3896809	But when I say, maybe like 50 bucks.
3897510	3899610	50 bucks on the 360 and the Wii, maybe, even.
3900010	3906211	Especially if it's... The source I got it from, they said Nintendo might not, would probably not think about it.
3906977	3910838	But maybe like just maybe the 360 and the PS3, possibly.
3911198	3912738	What if Nintendo announced this?
3912858	3915479	Because we still know the Wii's are coming in different colors, right?
3916319	3916539	Yeah.
3916639	3920280	What if they release the Wii's in different colors with no game included?
3920820	3920280	$199.
3920960	3921380	There you go.
3922360	3924021	Yeah, that would be good.
3924081	3924461	Yeah.
3924701	3929682	I think I could do it right there or put in some other type of pack in like, I don't know, demos or I don't know.
3930002	3933523	But yeah, just take Wii Sports out of the picture, charge $199 for the colored Wii's.
3934363	3936543	Yeah, I could probably see that happening.
3936723	3938404	There you go.
3938824	3945945	I mean, I knew it was coming, but I kind of figured maybe you might see it like maybe another year at least.
3947366	3950126	I'm telling you, by September, $50 price cuts on Wii and 360, $100 price cut on PS3.
3950166	3950246	Yeah.
3950266	3951186	If I was a Batman, there it is.
3951206	3952147	I say a $100 price cut on PS3.
3952167	3953887	They have to.
3953907	3954347	They have to.
3960283	3972532	Then again, they don't have to, actually, because what they could do is just, since they've already dropped their 60 gig or whatever, drop the 80 gig at the same price as their 60 and maybe do... Throw in a game or something to make it.
3972652	3977716	Well, no, not necessarily throw it in a game, but do the 20 gig price for the 60 gig now.
3977916	3981719	Okay, then if they don't cut it by 100, they'll put something in there to sweeten the deal.
3983360	3989385	Maybe they'll drop it by 50, but put $50 worth of extra crap in it, like another game, the hard drive increase, like you're saying, something like that.
3989895	3996141	Yeah, I mean, worst case scenario is that if, like I said, PlayStation 3 does make that cut, you're probably going to see the PS2 hit the $99 mark.
3996201	3997342	I mean, I saw the thing, and I was like,
4017714	4019935	I can't believe you told that.
4021436	4025158	All right, well, thank you so much, Dark Knight, for your call, and we'll see what happens on the price cut front.
4025639	4025939	All right?
4026679	4027240	All right, thank you.
4027260	4028000	All right, take care, buddy.
4028841	4029041	Bye.
4029881	4032803	All right.
4032883	4035505	Going on to some... Lots and lots of comments from chat here.
4035545	4035865	Let's see.
4035925	4040307	Rob D. says, I wouldn't be enjoying my 360 half as much if I wasn't a member of an online community.
4040888	4044650	The Wii doesn't really have much of anything going for it at the moment beyond the virtual console.
4045510	4046291	Hmm, interesting.
4047089	4076154	James Patrick says PlayStation 2 won't drop to $99 for a while Sony needs the profit from its current price let's see James Patrick says PlayStation 3 sales are in the gutter that needs to increase software wise I mean hardware is important too but software is what counts Blackboy says the 360 has been out considerably longer than the Wii but in terms of sales Wii is outselling 360 by crazy amounts
4077315	4079256	Very interesting perspectives there in chat.
4079716	4083038	BlackDevilerX says, We're using the Dreamcast as the minimum bar for sales.
4084939	4085360	Interesting.
4085900	4086240	All right.
4088381	4094425	Of course, if you have more comments, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelondradio.com, and we'll read those emails next week.
4094705	4099128	Actually, not next week, but in two weeks on the program, because a reminder, there will be no show next week.
4099428	4101629	Let's go around and see if there's any last-minute stories.
4103310	4104991	Actually, I found something interesting.
4105949	4110210	Just some early pictures of the Guitar Hero 3 Les Paul controller.
4111230	4112190	Pretty freaking cool.
4113191	4114271	What's so special about it?
4114911	4118112	Well, they've done two other Gibson guitars.
4118172	4122393	They did probably one of, in my opinion, one of their best.
4123553	4127574	Actually, I'm going to link the article in the chat room so they can see the pictures.
4127634	4129274	It actually looks really sweet, and the buttons on it...
4129975	4132498	are black with the colored outlines.
4132758	4135781	It's really a lot different than the other controllers have looked.
4137282	4139184	More minimalist.
4141386	4141786	All right.
4143908	4144329	Anything else?
4145089	4145270	No.
4146090	4146391	Loki.
4147972	4151075	Anyway, so I actually got quite a few things.
4151796	4154558	First off, some interesting stuff coming out.
4156121	4162623	Well, first off, there's supposed to be a rumor that the next issue of EGM is going to reveal a brand new Soul Calibur title.
4163223	4165304	Not Soul Calibur Legends, I'm guessing.
4166204	4168425	Although, who knows, maybe they're doing that again.
4168525	4170785	We could use the next gen Soul Calibur game, that'd be pretty awesome.
4170805	4175427	So, a new Soul Calibur game possibly being announced, so that'd be kind of neat.
4176147	4183409	Another rumor that's going on, apparently a website, RPG Gamer, had an interview with NS America, and...
4184654	4192220	One of the questions was, or according to the Q&A, one of the answers to a question, is Disgaea coming into any other platforms?
4192701	4193621	They mentioned the DS.
4194122	4196263	So you might get Disgaea on the DS soon.
4198565	4199326	Let's see here.
4200327	4205991	Also, there's an interesting thing going on.
4206332	4207633	Apparently, certain...
4210046	4213187	Lawyer type by the name of Jack was supposed to be... Voldemort?
4213247	4214228	You mean Lord Voldemort?
4214448	4223091	Yeah, Voldemort was apparently going to be debating or participating in a debate during PAX this year.
4223551	4228093	Of course, this was supposed to be kept under wraps and no word if he's going to back out of that one.
4228973	4232715	I had heard he already did because he put out some retort to... He thought it was...
4233413	4233933	and DarkSakura.com.
4261813	4267074	and VideoOut for playing on your television as well as SD card for game storage and etc.
4267594	4272855	So, kind of nifty to see him actually making a console instead of modding them.
4272915	4278956	Speaking about homebrew stuff, there was a game I talked about on the show a while back called No Gravity.
4279016	4281416	It's kind of like a Descent Free Space type game.
4281456	4283337	I think I showed it to you, Rob, one time.
4283757	4289258	The best fucking homebrew game ever on the PSP and they're actually going to have it finished in June.
4290078	4291058	Full version will be coming out
4291411	4292552	For free!
4293632	4299496	And it's really sad because the game can, you know, wipe most of those other PSP games out there.
4299756	4302658	And it's developed independently and for free.
4302858	4306100	So check out No Gravity later on this month.
4307581	4309262	And let's see here.
4309843	4311424	One other thing that's kind of interesting.
4312324	4313245	Also a trademark.
4313697	4317719	Apparently Capcom made a trademark for Apollo Justice.
4318099	4319800	There's two rumors regarding this.
4320161	4327745	Some people think it's going to be a new rival schools game because apparently I guess the school is named Apollo or something like that.
4327925	4329085	No, it's Justice.
4329306	4329746	Justice.
4330246	4331427	Anyways.
4332487	4339171	The other theory is that it's a subtitle for the next Phoenix Wright game.
4340252	4341112	Could be either or, huh?
4342690	4344270	I want more rival schools, please.
4344911	4345171	All right.
4345671	4347712	I have a real quick last-minute story as well.
4347772	4349533	And, Loki, you'll like this one, I think.
4351254	4358618	1UP recently had an interview with the creator of the Mega Man franchise, and they were asking him about sequels and bringing Mega Man to the next-gen platforms.
4359178	4365502	And he basically said, well, don't know if we would be able to recoup the cost of making a game on the next-gen platforms.
4365542	4367883	But they said, come on, just imagine money wasn't an issue.
4367903	4368363	What would you do?
4368383	4369644	And he said this, quote,
4370359	4400107	I think it would probably be Mega Man Legends 3 and that's just not or that's not just me a lot of the original team members would also love to make a sequel they talk about it I talk about it sometimes I know they love that series and so do I if I were to say right now I have a tiny tiny tiny dream that I wish I could realize but I don't know if it's possible it would be to do a sequel in the Legends series hell yeah that's a series that they need to take it even further because these other series kind of suck that's a series they need to shoot in the head put it down like an old horse put her down
4400757	4402558	Give me more Mega Man X, please.
4403659	4404760	I love the Legends series.
4404900	4406121	Sorry, I'm a 2D gamer.
4408103	4410705	I would like to see some type of next-gen Mega Man.
4410745	4412206	I think it's okay to do a 2D Mega Man.
4412226	4414708	Continue Legends series on the Wii.
4414928	4415448	It's perfect.
4415989	4418210	I mean, it's an original PlayStation game.
4418230	4420772	You can definitely push those kind of graphics on that system.
4420832	4421713	It's not Mega Man.
4422513	4423134	Who cares?
4423594	4424055	I do.
4424235	4425175	I love Mega Man.
4425235	4428398	And for me, just to have it go 3D in the first place was like...
4429264	4431985	Ripping out my heart and dancing the Lambada on it.
4432065	4435486	No, you like the Mega Man X series and the original Mega Man series.
4435506	4436226	This is a different series.
4436366	4437926	It's just like the Marvel series now.
4437946	4443507	They have the Marvel 2017 series and the Marvel Universe series and all this other stuff.
4443547	4444328	Well, it doesn't matter.
4445808	4448089	Just don't have to like this series.
4448409	4449949	I like this series, so they should make another one.
4450487	4454750	All I could say is, please, anything but those tactical games on the DS.
4454890	4455911	Amen, oh my god.
4456011	4457412	I think we can all agree on that.
4457432	4459173	That series, put it to bed.
4459314	4464117	Going on the same thing, though, that Loki's saying, that's actually based off of a completely different series.
4465018	4468060	The Mega Man EXE is what those were.
4468280	4470021	Yeah, or the Battle Network, that's what it's called.
4470041	4471402	Well, it was Rockman EXE.
4471443	4472203	Put it to bed.
4472703	4474044	It was actually based off of an anime.
4474605	4476086	Put a bullet in its head and be done.
4476559	4477960	It's not the same type of thing.
4478040	4480100	This is supposed to be Mega Man.
4480140	4483742	This is actually something 100% completely different, just borrowing the name.
4484902	4486603	It makes sense why it's a different type of game.
4487123	4487503	Alright.
4489004	4495186	And James Patrick says in chat, Mega Man, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man... Stop this!
4495746	4502308	As long as they don't do a next-gen series that looks like the cover of Mega Man 2 or something like that.
4503729	4504009	Okay.
4504810	4509991	The US Capcom art in those days, I mean, did you see the cover for Bionic Commando?
4510191	4511172	They were pretty awful.
4511712	4518514	The only cool game that had any, you know, American redone art that was any good was like Metal Gear.
4519554	4523475	Because the dude looked like, you know, hardcore awesome.
4523575	4524975	Oh no, the truck has started to move.
4524995	4528496	But at least in Bionic Commando you can kill Hitler.
4529357	4530617	Yeah, and you know what, some of the,
4531204	4540990	I always think of the box art even back from the Atari 2600 days where they had these elaborate artwork on the box, which of course the game looked nothing like because it was just a bunch of blocks on the screen.
4541351	4542071	It was just, I don't know.
4542892	4543732	Box art's funny.
4544493	4547955	Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it or not.
4548015	4550256	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4551057	4553338	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight, your final thought.
4556580	4557301	Okay, I thought it.
4559147	4561148	My final thought is ice cream.
4561888	4562689	Loki, your final thought.
4563289	4566030	My final thought is the screen for the Wii thing.
4566050	4567031	It looks kind of neat.
4567071	4568151	It's like a portable screen.
4568932	4569412	I don't know, though.
4569432	4570192	I still wouldn't buy it.
4571093	4571393	All right.
