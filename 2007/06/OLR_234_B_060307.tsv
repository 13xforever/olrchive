12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	19920	Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19920	26080	And weíre back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this our episode number 234 for June
26080	28080	the 3rd of 2007.
28080	32760	Weíll be celebrating our 5th anniversary on June 24th of this year if you can believe
32760	33760	it.
33760	37160	Thatís how weíve hit so many episodes if you wonder why 234 is a lot.
37160	39760	Anyhow, weíre going to get back into some gaming news.
39760	41800	Donít forget Orange Lounge Radio is in two parts every week.
41800	45440	If you missed some, be sure to go back wherever you got this episode.
45440	47100	Probably has part A linked as well.
47100	48100	Be sure to grab that.
48100	50000	Loki, why donít you start us off?
50000	56440	Yes, and letís talk a little bit about the hacking cracking scene on the Xbox 360.
56440	64280	Itís kind of interesting, Microsoft a couple of weeks ago took some precautions to ban
64280	66760	modders from their live service.
66760	72280	Well, in turn, modders have kind of fought back and theyíve created a brand new firmware
72280	81240	upgrade for the Toshiba DVD drives for the TS-H943 that will allow you to play backup
81240	87400	copies and legally purchase Xbox 360 tiles as well as it defeats all current and some
87400	91880	future Xbox Live detection attempts.
91880	98200	Because of that, itís actually allowing people to be able to use Xbox Live without them knowing
98200	102720	that you have a modded console.
102720	104840	Fight the fight, I guess.
104840	111440	But Microsoft has always been really good about fixing this kind of crap the second
111440	112440	it comes out.
112440	113440	They canít.
113440	114440	Sorry, I shouldnít say crap.
114440	115440	I mean, it actually is pretty smart.
115440	116440	But you know what I mean.
116440	119400	They put the ban hammer on this stuff ASAP.
119400	121920	So how long is this going to last?
121920	123520	Well, it depends.
123520	128940	Weíll see how effective this stuff is, but thatís big business for them.
128940	136560	If you look at Sony, theyíve tried and tried with the PSP, but thereís no luck there.
136560	141160	I donít know how much of DVD firmware they can really detect.
141160	147640	Thereís not really a lot that they can do, I think.
147640	152400	And if they circumvent the few methods that they have of checking, they might be screwed.
152400	157000	Unless they just do a whole hardware revision or something.
157000	158840	I guess weíll see.
158840	159840	I donít know.
159840	162280	What do you think, DarkSakura?
162280	166980	Do you think the hackers and crackers will win in this war, or do you think Microsoft
166980	169320	will be able to stay on top of them?
169320	175760	Thereís one thing that always works in favor of anyone who decides to system hack, and
175760	178840	thatís called system becoming obsolete.
178840	182080	Theyíre not going to care if the next oneís going to come out.
182080	185600	Theyíll say, ìWell, screw the old one.î And everyoneís like, ìYay, we win!î Because
185600	187480	we held out.
187480	189760	So itís kind of like a waiting war, essentially.
189760	190760	Yeah.
190760	191760	Interesting.
191760	192760	True.
192760	198720	I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 2, they had granted the methods of doing swap
198720	203900	disks and stuff like that, and the DVD loader and stuff, and now you have the whole running
203900	208400	off of hard drives and stuff, and itís just like, shit, I mean, you donít have to buy
208400	211240	anything for the PlayStation 2 anymore, you can download everything.
211240	213120	If people want it bad enough, theyíll find a way.
213120	217560	I remember the days of the seven swap trick for the first PlayStation.
217560	219200	Well, look at the original Xbox.
219200	226320	I mean, thatís, you know, modified firmware, running stuff off of hard drives, itís rampant.
226320	227880	All right.
227880	232120	I would say, too, if you donít want to get banned, donít take your console online, because
232120	233120	thatís how they fix it.
233120	234120	So, I donít know.
234120	238320	But then again, I guess the whole hack is to have the advantage online.
238320	240240	But I think thatís fucked up to cheat in online games.
240240	241440	I think those type of people deserve to get banned.
241440	243600	Well, I donít know if itís doing it for cheating in online games.
243600	248320	I think itís just not having to buy those $60 games is what theyíre doing.
248320	249920	Or maybe imports.
249920	250920	Imports might be nice.
250920	252160	Thatís kind of cool.
252160	255240	Yeah, I think, I donít agree with region control.
255240	259520	I mean, I understand why they do it, you know, so Iím not trying to say, like, oh, it makes
259520	263480	no sense because, you know, because of licensing and all those other things for the music and
263480	267720	what have you that they get in the games, but still, I mean, at the end of the day,
267720	273360	it sucks for the consumer, you know what I mean?
273360	279240	Anyhow, something else that is confusing, nevertheless, for the consumers is that Destructoid
279240	284600	ran this article earlier this week about the Xbox 360 and the fact that Metal Gear Solid
284600	288040	4 is confirmed for the Xbox 360.
288040	290480	Now, the article was kind of weird.
290480	292160	Like, you know, actually, itís funny.
292160	296320	The guy who wrote it, Ron Workman, was actually on our year-end special, so Iím kind of wondering
296320	299400	if we should call him up and try to figure out whatís going on, but I donít know if
299400	303080	theyíll talk because, supposedly, Konami sent out a cease and desist.
303080	306880	Now, Destructoid has always been a pretty respectable site in my mind, so I donít think
306880	310160	theyíd pull these stories out of their butt, so Iím just kind of wondering, like, it was
310160	314240	very interesting to kind of watch that happen where they had to be very vague about it and
314240	318400	then they have this cease and desist coming from Konami, which seems to cement it, if
318400	319600	that is legit.
319600	322680	I mean, I donít know, could the whole thing be an elaborate prank?
322680	324360	Who knows?
324360	328520	But Computer Game World seems to think so because they ran a counter-story a little
328520	329520	later on.
329520	330520	Iím sorry, thatís Computer and Video Games.
330520	332520	Sorry, carried it to the wrong side.
332520	337360	Computerandvideogames.com ran a counterpoint a little later on in the week saying, ìKonamiís
337360	339960	confirmed nothing,î is essentially what itís saying.
339960	343640	So saying that, no, Metal Gear Solid 4 has not been confirmed for 360, Konamiís confirmed
343640	344640	nothing.
344640	349200	But the weird thing about this report is that theyíre basing it on the fact that theyíve
349200	353820	talked to Konami and Konami refuses to comment on the rumors and that theyíve made no statement
353820	355320	regarding the 360 version.
355320	360240	And in my mind, I kind of go, ìWell, of course Konamiís not going to say anything about
360240	361240	it.
361240	364400	If they send a cease and desist to one site, itís because theyíre not ready to comment
364400	365400	on this.
365400	366400	Trust us.
366400	372700	We know this very well, okay?î So it kind of doesnít mean anything.
372700	375280	To me, that doesnít discount the story at all.
375280	377280	So I donít know.
377280	383000	Well, speaking of the rumor mill and Konami, wow, there actually were rumors that popped
383000	388320	up in this monthís issue of EGM stating that Silent Hill 5 was going to be released this
388320	393680	year and handled by Konami USA instead of in Japan.
393680	401560	But there was also an interview with the director, Tsubuyama Masashi, who, like I said, was the
401560	405440	chief director on the project.
405440	410000	And he stated that they donít have anything official.
410000	416200	There actually were looking more next-gen console, multi-platform, that he did say to
416200	419600	keep your eyes on the upcoming press conference on July 11th.
419600	422360	And thatís during E3, isnít it?
422360	423360	Yep.
423360	424360	Boom.
424360	426240	So theyíll probably be revealing Silent Hill 5 at that time.
426240	427240	Yeah.
427240	428240	Interesting.
428240	430440	Try to find my invite.
430440	432400	Well, I donít know.
432400	434480	As long as the series doesnít jump the shark, Iíll be okay.
434480	437280	I think multi-platform is the way to go, though, honestly.
437280	438280	More pea-hitty.
438280	441720	Because, you know, Xbox 360 still hasnít really cracked the marketplace in Japan.
441720	445520	I mean, obviously, I think most of us here would like to see it show up on 360.
445520	448040	But over in Japan, you kind of have to put it on PlayStation 3.
448040	450760	The Wii is just probably not going to be able to handle what theyíre going to want to do
450760	452080	graphically with the game.
452080	456520	You should have Silent Hill where you play as, you know, Pyramid Head.
456520	458880	Itís Pyramid Head Adventures with Silent Hill.
458880	460360	Well, you know, maybeÖ
460360	464280	Watch that crazy cat as he goes and beheads people, the giant metal shark thing.
464280	466400	No, he has to hump all the female monsters.
466400	469360	Just the female monsters and rapes them and rips their skin off.
469360	471120	Well, Iíll put a prediction out there.
471120	474120	Remember that the Silent Hill is getting an arcade game.
474120	475320	Remember we talked about that a while ago?
475320	478260	There was some arcade expo and they showed a Silent Hill thing there.
478260	482000	Maybe the Wii will get that because you could easily point and shoot with the controller.
482000	483000	So maybe the Wiiís not on.
483000	484880	Weíre talking Silent Hill Gun Survivor.
484880	486520	Thatís kind of cool, though.
486520	493000	Silent Hill Babies coming to ABC Family Saturday mornings.
493000	496640	Underdog Harold says Pyramid Head Mysterious Dungeon would be a fun game.
496640	497640	That would be great.
497640	500440	With cutesy little music and everything.
500440	504880	Super chibi, Pyramid Head, you know.
504880	508520	Aww, he just beheaded the cat.
508520	513800	That would be fantastic.
513800	518140	Anyways, other interesting stuff.
518140	525480	Coming out of the Halo 3 beta, thereís been people actually hacking the beta to reveal
525480	533960	all sorts of fun stuff, including they have a brand new chopper that you can ride in the
533960	535840	game.
535840	545040	The sword as well as radar jamming items, player operated turrets added to the Wraiths,
545040	551640	actually playing with the Wraith, and different modifications, including ground speed and
551640	554200	gravity and all that sorts of stuff.
554200	557840	And pretty cool, I guess, that you can modify the beta to do that.
557840	562360	I canít believe people have already cracked the game and itís already in beta.
562360	564400	Just imagine when the game actually comes out.
564400	568600	Iím not surprised they did this because people love their Halo almost a little too much,
568600	570600	you know what I mean?
570600	571600	Yeah.
571600	572600	Well, there you go.
572600	576000	Also, something to mention about Halo 3 is that GamePro is going to be running an article
576000	580280	talking about that there are, well actually I should say the article is going to be showing
580280	583200	new vehicles, new maps, new weapons, and armor.
583200	587360	Thatís right, because Halo 3 is going to have armor in it, new armor.
587360	591560	You can create, I shouldnít say create, but you can get armor for your characters, like
591560	594800	new shoulder pads, new helmets, so thatís kind of cool.
594800	599560	Like I look at this one helmet on the particular scans from the site, it looks like an alien
599560	602560	head or something on the helmet, so kind of neat.
602560	606120	It looks like you can almost create your own character from all these custom parts, which
606120	607120	is good.
607120	611360	Itís kind of taking it a step further because in Halo 2 you can pretty much pick the human
611360	616080	looking guy, the master chief, or the alien looking guy, and then you can choose the colors
616080	617080	in the emblem, thatís it.
617080	620840	So I think that would be kind of fun if you could take it a step further.
620840	623640	Suddenly Halo has turned Barbie, I donít know.
623640	625480	That just seems to be a common thing.
625480	630380	How long have games had multiple outfits and things that go on in them?
630380	633440	Like Dead Rising, huh?
633440	641320	Dead Rising has some new costumes and themes for Xbox Live, but the costumes are a white
641320	644040	suit, a striped outfit, and an accountant outfit.
644040	649560	Yeah, because I really like to look like an accountant when Iím beating up the undead.
649560	652640	You know, I put on my suit.
652640	653640	You could.
653640	655120	I keep your tally.
655120	656120	One beheading!
656120	657120	Two beheadings!
657120	659120	Doesnít that game keep up body kills anyway?
659120	660120	Yeah, it does.
660120	664840	So I guess you can look the part when youíre adding up the corpses.
664840	665840	Anyway.
665840	671040	And you can also dress up like an accountant and slam like a cash register into them.
671040	675160	Itís like, ìKeep the change!î Office space the game.
675160	677640	Do they have a Naked Time costume in that game?
677640	679620	Like you know, Underoos or something?
679620	683200	They have really tight like shorts that you can wear, little kidís shorts.
683200	684200	I donít know about that.
684200	685240	Thatís a little scary.
685240	690400	You could run around as hard gay, beating up the zombies.
690400	691400	All right.
691400	692400	Good times.
692400	694840	You know what they really need, though?
694840	700920	They really need like the giant leafs that they have in, oh god, people that sing Yata.
700920	702840	I canít remember the name of the band.
702840	703840	Hapatai.
703840	704840	Hapatai, yeah.
704840	706440	Yeah, they need a giant leaf in that game.
706440	709480	Thatís the only thing thatís missing.
709480	715000	So some interesting stuff happening in New York this week, including some bills being
715000	721960	passed regarding the ESRB ratings and selling minors M-rated games.
721960	729720	Apparently, the law has passed and itís going to make a felony, a class E felony at least,
729720	736360	the least severe felony in the state, if you sell a M-rated game to a minor.
736360	744760	So better be careful before you sell those Mortal Kombat and Grand Theft Autos to kids
744760	745760	out there.
745760	750920	And unfortunately, you know, I guess it has been approved, so hoorah.
750920	751920	By one part.
751920	753200	Why by one branch or something, right?
753200	754200	Yes.
754200	756360	Itís been approved by the New York Assembly.
756360	758120	This law sucks.
758120	759640	And you know why it sucks?
759640	764520	Because is this same rule being applied to theaters that sell tickets to underage folks
764520	766680	trying to get an R-rated movie?
766680	768680	Then this law is not fair.
768680	770880	Thatís why this law sucks.
770880	772360	Thatís all.
772360	773880	Itís bullshit.
773880	776280	Grand Staney is what it is.
776280	777280	Itís stupid.
777280	778280	Thatís right.
778280	779280	Itís stupid.
779280	780280	All right.
780280	784640	Weíre going to get into, and actually Iím looking at some comments in the chat room
784640	785640	here.
785640	788840	Act Def says, ìLaw sucks in general.î Yes, sometimes.
788840	793160	Rama says, ìUnless New York State does a lot of secret shopping and or undercover sting
793160	798280	operations,î which they wonít, ìthis law will not fucking stick at all.î And Gerardimo
798280	802340	says, ìAw, Iím a New York minor, but I only have a Wii, so Iím going to have a far hard
802340	804160	time finding an M game.î
804160	806960	Um, Scarface, Manhunt, Driver, um.
806960	810440	Yeah, but donít buy Driver.
810440	813080	Yeah, unless you want to laugh.
813080	814080	All right.
814080	815080	Itís the bad AI.
815080	820780	Well, folks, itís about time that we play a little bit of our favorite game to play
820780	822760	here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

901720	905860	By the way, tonight, speaking of panelists, tonightís edition of the match game here
905860	910080	on Orange Lounge Radio, we had to do it tonight dedicated to Mr. Charles Nelson Reilly, who
910080	915860	was from the 70s edition of the match game, which, you know, obviously we are blatantly
915860	917880	ripping off the match game from the 70s.
917880	919760	You see the reruns on game show networks.
919760	923040	He passed away this week and was one of the main reasons to watch that show.
923040	924040	He was awesome.
924040	926000	So weíre dedicating this edition to him.
926000	929080	So anyway, so yes, Rice Princess and Mielethauk are here.
929080	933240	They are sacrificing some of their precious time away from watching Battlestar Galactica
933240	937280	episodes back to back to back to be here, because you guys have watched, like, what,
937280	938840	like seven episodes so far this weekend?
938840	939840	How many?
939840	940840	We have.
940840	941840	Seven episodes?
941840	942840	We have a lot.
942840	943840	All right.
943840	944840	We donít want to take up too much of your precious time.
944840	946240	This is Loki.
946240	947240	Yes.
947240	948240	Iím here.
948240	950120	I know, of course.
950120	952120	And Dark Sakura.
952120	953280	Roar.
953280	954840	And me, because Iím awesome.
954840	955840	All right.
955840	956840	So you have five folks tonight.
956840	958320	And Wonder Dog Haroldís on the phone.
958320	959320	You still there?
959320	960320	Yep.
960320	961320	Good.
961320	963520	And heís going to be playing against Hitstun from the chat room.
963520	966440	Hitstun from the chat room won our drawing during the break.
966440	967440	Okay.
967440	968680	Now, Wonder Dog Harold, do you know how the game works?
968680	969680	Yep.
969680	970680	Okay.
970680	973620	Weíre going to, for those that donít, Iíll just explain it again, weíre going to be
973620	975320	asking some questions.
975320	979800	And weíre going to put in the blanks, but thereís blanks at the end of them.
979800	983580	And you are supposed to come up with what you believe belongs in the blank.
983580	987280	And if you match with anybody in the studio, then you get a point.
987280	988280	All right.
988280	990840	So we only have three questions tonight, though.
990840	992320	Itís a short game tonight.
992320	993800	Are you ready to play?
993800	994800	Yeah.
994800	995800	All right.
995800	998160	Are you ready to play, Wonder Dog Harold?
998160	999160	Yep.
999160	1000160	All right.
1000160	1001160	Here you go.
1001160	1002160	Here is question number one.
1002160	1003160	All right.
1003160	1005320	Here it is.
1005320	1008600	Rob just landed himself in big trouble.
1008600	1013760	When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card
1013760	1015520	was declined.
1015520	1020720	Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, ìRob, we turned off your credit
1020720	1036360	card because youíve been buying too much blank.î All our guests are thinking about
1036360	1037360	their answers.
1037360	1038640	Theyíre writing them down.
1038640	1044280	ìRob, we turned off your credit card because youíve been buying too much blank.î Okay.
1044280	1046840	All right.
1046840	1059080	Iím waiting for the ñ okay, there we go.
1059080	1060080	And all right.
1060080	1061080	All right.
1061080	1062560	You got an answer, Wonder Dog Harold?
1062560	1063560	You ready?
1063560	1064560	Heís still thinking.
1064560	1065560	All right.
1065560	1067560	While youíre thinking, all right.
1067560	1068560	Here we go.
1068560	1071360	Iíll read the question one more time, then weíre going to go to you for an answer.
1071360	1072360	Here it is.
1072360	1074840	ìRob just landed himself in big trouble.
1074840	1078360	When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card
1078360	1079740	was declined.
1079740	1082520	Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, ìRob, we turned off your credit
1082520	1087080	card because youíve been buying too much ñî What do you think, Wonder Dog Harold?
1087080	1088080	Porn.
1088080	1089080	Porn, says Wonder Dog Harold.
1089080	1090480	Too much porn.
1090480	1096640	Hitstun also said porn, so this isnít going to be a very exciting round because if anybody
1096640	1098120	gets porn, they both get a point.
1098120	1099120	Thatís all right.
1099120	1101120	Letís see what our celebrity panel came up with.
1101120	1103040	Weíll start with Rice Princess.
1103040	1110240	Heís been buying too much ñ ìSilent, occupied Caprica.î Too much silent, occupied Caprica.
1110240	1112160	Is that a match?
1112160	1113560	No, that would not be a match.
1113560	1114560	Is that a match?
1114560	1117640	Thatís something from Battlestar Galactica, actually, and we are playing video game match
1117640	1118640	game now.
1118640	1119640	Oh.
1119640	1120640	All right.
1120640	1121640	Miklotov.
1121640	1125720	Heís been buying too much ñ Because porn is such a totally video game-related
1125720	1126720	thing.
1126720	1131280	Heís been buying too much helo, which is like halo but helo.
1131280	1132280	Helo.
1132280	1133800	That would be porn for me.
1133800	1136240	Another Battlestar Galactica reference.
1136240	1137280	Thank you very much for that.
1137280	1139280	Too much helo.
1139280	1143560	Not a match, though, even if that is the object of Shaneís fantasies we donít need to hear
1143560	1144560	about on the show.
1144560	1145560	Loki.
1145560	1148680	Heís been buying too much ñ Actraiser.
1148680	1149680	Actraiser.
1149680	1150680	Good guess.
1150680	1151680	Good guess.
1151680	1153160	Loved it so much, he had to buy it five times over.
1153160	1155200	Yes, to put it in the top five somewhere.
1155200	1156200	He bought it for all his friends.
1156200	1157200	Actually, there you go.
1157200	1158960	He filled up one whole page on his ñ Of Actraiser.
1158960	1160960	Oh, I should do that.
1160960	1161960	Dark Sakura.
1161960	1162960	Heís been buying too much.
1162960	1163960	Propel.
1163960	1164960	Propel.
1164960	1165960	I havenít used it in ages.
1165960	1166960	I know.
1166960	1167960	Propel.
1167960	1168960	I actually drank some Propel today.
1168960	1169960	Was it good?
1169960	1170960	Mm-hmm.
1170960	1171960	Wow, Rob.
1171960	1172960	Itís like fitness water.
1172960	1173960	Itís good.
1173960	1174960	All right.
1174960	1177480	I put ñ Rob, we turned off your credit card because youíve been buying too much candy
1177480	1178920	because Iím fat.
1178920	1179920	Candy.
1179920	1180920	Sorry.
1180920	1183080	There you go.
1183080	1184080	So there it is.
1184080	1186120	No matches for either contestant that round.
1186120	1187120	Sorry to say.
1187120	1188120	Sorry, Wonder Dog Herald.
1188120	1189120	Aw.
1189120	1190120	All right.
1190120	1193520	That was ñ that was very emotive.
1193520	1194520	I like that.
1194520	1195520	All right, you ready?
1195520	1197000	You ready to get some points on the second question?
1197000	1198000	Sure.
1198000	1199000	All right.
1199000	1200000	Here we go.
1200000	1204760	Thatís what I like, some excited contestants.
1204760	1206160	Here we go.
1206160	1212760	Question number two, Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort.
1212760	1213760	Liar.
1213760	1216160	But sheís been very ñ itís a game, Jamie.
1216160	1217160	Play along.
1217160	1222040	Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but sheís been very impressed with
1222040	1226600	all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs lately because, you know,
1226600	1229720	like they have the little coasters that have like Zelda pictures and stuff.
1229720	1231200	Letís go to Kotaku or something.
1231200	1232200	Youíll see it.
1232200	1234880	Sheís been very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs
1234880	1235880	lately.
1235880	1240960	She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class when her first
1240960	1247960	project she brought in was blank.
1247960	1253160	She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class when for her
1253160	1256320	first project she brought in blank.
1256320	1260040	All right, ding.
1260040	1261040	Ding.
1261040	1262040	Ding.
1262040	1263040	All right.
1263040	1264040	All right.
1264040	1274320	Iím just waiting for our chat room player, and hopefully our phone player has thought
1274320	1276720	of an answer too.
1276720	1279520	The chat room is helping out.
1279520	1282720	All right.
1282720	1288080	Wow, one of these answers is an incredibly poor taste.
1288080	1289720	All right.
1289720	1291840	I usually are though.
1291840	1293840	All right, here we go.
1293840	1294840	Here we go.
1294840	1295840	Is everybody dinged?
1295840	1296840	All right.
1296840	1297840	Ding.
1297840	1298840	All right, here we go.
1298840	1299840	Here we go.
1299840	1303480	Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but sheís been very impressed with
1303480	1306360	all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs lately.
1306360	1310720	She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class for when her
1310720	1314920	first project she brought inóWonder Dog Harold?
1314920	1316920	A sweater with hard gay on it.
1316920	1318840	A sweater with hard gay on it.
1318840	1319840	Okay, good.
1319840	1322520	Heís been paying attention to the show because Jamieís been watching hard gay.
1322520	1325320	Okay, good, good answer, but weíll see if it matches.
1325320	1327640	Hitstun said a shotgun.
1327640	1330800	She brought in a shotgun, which might beó
1330800	1331800	Too soon.
1331800	1332800	Too soon.
1332800	1334520	A little bit, but all right, thatís the answer.
1334520	1338400	All right, Rice Princess, she brought in?
1338400	1342400	She brought in a Cylon Occupied Caprica.
1342400	1351140	Unfortunately, Cylon Occupied Caprica is not a match and is still a Battlestar Galactica
1351140	1352680	reference Rice Princess.
1352680	1357520	We are playing video gameóCandy is not video games either, so shut up.
1357520	1359120	Nintendoís cereal was candy.
1359120	1362480	Thereís a Battlestar game coming out, so take that.
1362480	1364920	Will it have Cylon Occupied Caprica in it?
1364920	1365920	Probably.
1365920	1366920	All right, here it is.
1366920	1368920	For her first project, she brought inóHelo.
1368920	1377240	Guys, you know what your next answers have to be, right?
1377240	1380800	Possibly.
1380800	1384120	This by the way will be the last appearance of Rice Princess and Miklótov on our show.
1384120	1385120	Say goodbye, folks.
1385120	1386120	Itís been fun.
1386120	1387640	Itís been a fun five years.
1387640	1391320	Itís been swell, but the swellingís gone down.
1391320	1395680	All right, Loki, she brought in?
1395680	1398800	The corpse of Charles Nelson Riley.
1398800	1400800	Too soon.
1400800	1403480	Too soon.
1403480	1405020	In my refrigerator, hi.
1405020	1409280	She brought in the corpse of Charles Nelson Riley to her knitting class?
1409280	1410580	Thatís horrible.
1410580	1416320	She needed a reference, a lifelike reference of knitting his corpse.
1416320	1418000	Dark Sakura, she brought in?
1418000	1419600	A Glock 37.
1419600	1421600	A Glock 37?
1421600	1422600	Too soon.
1422600	1423600	Itís a gun.
1423600	1424600	Donít you watch the news?
1424600	1425600	No.
1425600	1427880	You are not supposed to make guns at college jokes.
1427880	1428880	Itís not cool.
1428880	1431640	If you donít make fun of it, how will you ever recover?
1431640	1432640	All right, true.
1432640	1434000	Hey, itís a half of a match, though.
1434000	1435640	Is a Glock 37 a shotgun?
1435640	1436640	I donít think so.
1436640	1439640	No, but itís a firearm, so it gets to have a point.
1439640	1445920	No, porn and helo are not a match, neither is shotgun and whatever Jamie said.
1445920	1446920	All right.
1446920	1449320	But itís a powerful gun.
1449320	1453200	GS 191 says, does this mean I can call Loki a nappy-headed hoe, then?
1453200	1455080	I donít know, maybe.
1455080	1456080	He kind of is.
1456080	1458080	My hair is not nappy.
1458080	1459080	Anyway.
1459080	1461080	Dude, the chat room calls for half a point.
1461080	1462080	All right.
1462080	1465080	No, thatís nice for the chat room, too bad itís not their game.
1465080	1471360	All right, anyway, I said that she brought in, because it was a knitting class, she brought
1471360	1474920	in a quilt with Pyramid Head raping a corpse.
1474920	1476960	All right.
1476960	1477960	And it actually wasÖ
1477960	1480040	Of course, I know you donít make quilts in knitting class.
1480040	1481040	You donít knit a quilt.
1481040	1483680	Thatís why they kicked her out, stupid.
1483680	1486960	Well, my other answer was going to be bloody steel needles.
1486960	1491760	Actually, Pyramid Head was raping Charles Nelson Rileyís corpse, so go figure.
1491760	1493980	With a shotgun.
1493980	1495520	That would not be attractive.
1495520	1498080	That would be attractive, Rob.
1498080	1501160	So Wonder Dog Harold, Iím very sorry, you still have a zero.
1501160	1502160	Ow!
1502160	1503160	Shit!
1503160	1504960	That hurt!
1504960	1506560	And Dark Soccer just injured herself.
1506560	1507560	So at least you get that.
1507560	1509480	No, I injured my laptop and indirectly injured myself.
1509480	1510480	All right.
1510480	1514720	Wonder Dog Harold, are you going to get a point on this last one?
1514720	1515720	At least one.
1515720	1516720	All right, at least one.
1516720	1518760	Here we go.
1518760	1522000	Here it is, the last question, folks.
1522000	1526880	Piggy was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fauna Mae.
1526880	1530680	He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.
1530680	1533560	He said to himself, ìThatís it.
1533560	1543960	Next year Iím coming dressed as blank.î
1543960	1547000	He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.
1547000	1548720	He said to himself, ìThatís it.
1548720	1566840	Next year Iím coming dressed as blank.î
1566840	1570960	No extra fur, youíre too late, you canít play now.
1570960	1571960	I want to ding.
1571960	1573960	I want to do a bonus point.
1573960	1577400	You canít do a bonus point.
1577400	1580040	Fine, extra fur wants to be a bonus point.
1580040	1581040	Fine.
1581040	1583040	All right, yeah, I think we got an answer.
1583040	1585200	All right, there we go.
1585200	1588160	All right, thereís the end of the music.
1588160	1590600	All right, here we go.
1590600	1593920	Loki was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fauna Mae.
1593920	1596200	He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.
1596200	1597740	He said to himself, ìThatís it.
1597740	1599600	Next year Iím coming dressed asî.
1599600	1600600	Wonder Dog Harold?

1613120	1614120	Oh, Iím sorry.
1614120	1615120	Oh, yeah, thatís right.
1615120	1616120	Hitstun, sorry.
1616120	1621160	Hitstun said, ìIím coming dressed as missworld96nude.î
1621160	1622160	Good answer, good answer.
1622160	1623160	All right, letís see.

1626160	1628800	Rice Princess was number one, though, so.
1628800	1629800	I grabbed the microphone.
1629800	1631440	Fine, Mieglotov, what was your answer?

1660800	1663040	You guys totally screwed Wonder Dog Harold out of a point.
1663040	1664800	I had already planned mine, so.
1664800	1667000	Wonder Dog Harold, would you care to yell at our celebrities?
1667000	1668000	No.
1668000	1669640	Somebody could still say Helo.
1669640	1670640	All right, here we go.
1670640	1671640	Thereís three of you guys left.
1671640	1672640	All right, yeah, thatís true.

1673640	1676320	Loki, he decided to come dressed as?
1676320	1679480	I was just going to say it myself.
1679480	1680740	I donít cosplay.
1680740	1682640	Fuck this shit.
1682640	1684040	I donít cosplay.
1684040	1685040	Fuck this shit.
1685040	1686040	Itís not a match.
1686040	1687040	Iím sorry to say.
1687040	1689040	Dark Sakura, heís going to come dressed as?
1689040	1691040	Hadouge.
1691040	1692920	Hadouge.
1692920	1694160	Also not a match.
1694160	1697040	And I said, next year Iím coming dressed as?
1697040	1698040	Helo, obvious.
1698040	1699040	Tingle.
1699040	1702000	Helo, heís coming dressed as Tingle.
1702000	1704960	For finally the OLR fans could be happy.
1704960	1705960	And fine.
1705960	1707520	Extrovert wants a bonus point.
1707520	1709040	Letís see if thereís a match.
1709040	1710800	You could decide the game right here.
1710800	1712560	Iím going to come dressed as?
1712560	1718160	I was going to say Hot Dog from, oh, from Battlestar Galactica.
1718160	1726960	I fucking hate this show.
1726960	1735080	So there it is, unfortunately nobody won, hitstun got zero, and Wonder Dog Harold, Iím
1735080	1736920	sorry to say you got zero as well.
1736920	1738840	So you have to give us money.
1738840	1740000	Can I say something?
1740000	1741000	Yes.
1741000	1744360	My dogís been lost for two days and they found her.
1744360	1745360	In one piece?
1745360	1746360	Yes.
1746360	1747360	Good.
1747360	1750640	Iím glad the bitch is okay.
1750640	1753360	I was really depressed for two days.
1753360	1754360	Alright.
1754360	1759280	Um, Wonder Dog Harold, as a consolation prize, Iíll let you plug any website or something
1759280	1761880	you want to give a plug to here on air.
1761880	1763480	Um, nope.
1763480	1769360	Youíre a man of many words, Wonder Dog Harold, I appreciate it.
1769360	1772360	Thank you for calling in and being a contestant tonight.
1772360	1773360	Alrighty.
1773360	1775360	Alright, take care.
1775360	1776360	Bye-bye.
1776360	1777360	Bye.
1777360	1778360	Bye.
1778360	1779360	That was great.
1779360	1780360	We need to have you on the show more often.
1780360	1784600	I think Wonder Dog Harold said like ten words, itís like when Megalodon gets on the show,
1784600	1785600	he says ten words the entire show.
1785600	1789920	You need to be in studio and weíll see if you speak more.
1789920	1790920	Alright.
1790920	1796600	Alright, so we have zero, zero, everybody is a loser.
1796600	1800000	Hitstun says the chat failed me, theyíre fired.
1800000	1804920	Hitstun says, you know, I can challenge Wonder Dog Harold at Tetris DS or Mario Kart or something.
1804920	1808440	I know the chat room was screaming Tingle, it would have been a point.
1808440	1810720	Alright, thatís it for Match Game.
1810720	1815400	And at this point I will now kick out all of the guests because they obviously need
1815400	1816400	to go watch Battlestar Galactica.
1816400	1818800	Do you want some ice cream though?
1818800	1819800	I want ice cream.
1819800	1820800	Are you guys going to get ice cream?
1820800	1821800	Get milkshakes.
1821800	1822800	No.
1822800	1823800	I donít want to get ice cream.
1823800	1824800	You guys get ice cream.
1824800	1825800	You can get me a milkshake.
1825800	1828200	Or we can go get ice cream and not bring any back.
1828200	1831740	How about this, Iíll let, okay, weíll let you guys take over the afterbirth while we
1831740	1832740	go get ice cream.
1832740	1837880	Can we make our own cage match?
1837880	1838880	Yeah, can you?
1838880	1839880	No, I donít think so.
1839880	1840880	Damn it.
1840880	1841880	I put in an awesome song.
1841880	1842880	Well, think about it.
1842880	1843880	Alright.
1843880	1844880	Think about it and come get back to me.
1844880	1845880	Weíll get back to you.
1845880	1846880	Alright.
1846880	1850440	Alright, I know, thereís going to be a theme from Battlestar Galactica.
1850440	1852600	You can let me do it and itíll all be Doctor Who.
1852600	1855680	Alright, well, tonightís Match Game was a colossal failure.
1855680	1859800	Doctor Who is cooler than Battlestar Galactica.
1859800	1861480	I donít know, I donít know about that.
1861480	1862480	It is a pretty good show.
1862480	1863480	Donít egg them on.
1863480	1864480	Yeah, seriously.
1864480	1865480	Donít encourage them.
1865480	1867480	Alright, letís talk about porn.
1867480	1868480	Yay!
1868480	1870160	Can I get a yay for porn?
1870160	1871160	Yay!
1871160	1872160	Yay!
1872160	1874520	Well, actually this isnít real porn, but itís Leisure Suit Larry, which is kind of
1874520	1878600	like, you know, it was kind of like the Cinemax of gaming back in the day.
1878600	1881680	It was like, you know, you might see a titty if you freeze frame once in a while.
1881680	1885040	Well, Leisure Suit Larry is coming to mobile platforms.
1885040	1886180	Thatís right.
1886180	1889080	You can see some pixelated boobies.
1889080	1893320	God For Sale, which was the seventh game in the Leisure Suit Larry series, is coming to
1893320	1894320	cell phones.
1894320	1895320	Go figure.
1895320	1899160	Itís coming from Vivendi Games Mobile, and itís coming out in September.
1899160	1902840	But if youíre in Europe, youíre getting it first, you get it in June.
1902840	1907280	Quote from this one, President of Vivendi Games Mobile, Paul Maglione, quote, ìLarry
1907280	1910560	fans worldwide have a strong allegiance to the classic Leisure Suit Larry adventure game
1910560	1911560	format.
1911560	1914040	We are delighted to be doing just that with the mobile version.
1914040	1918300	Weíve kept the iconic Larry humor and attitude intact while adapting the graphics, language
1918300	1924040	and controls for a mass market global audience.î So there you go, some pixelated JavaScript
1924040	1926840	titty coming to a cell phone near you.
1926840	1927840	Yay.
1927840	1934720	And if you want your titties to be more realistic, then Dead or Alive the movie is coming out
1934720	1944740	June 15th, and well, itís going to be about as deep as Mortal Kombat the movie, probably
1944740	1952800	less deep, but it will be coming out to theaters, and there will be lots of chicks fighting,
1952800	1957360	and I know thereís one scene with a chick fighting topless, but of course, you know,
1957360	1958360	this isó
1958360	1961680	Is this because youíve already watched the whole movie on Google video when it was out
1961680	1962680	a while ago?
1962680	1966720	No, but I downloaded the PSP version of it off of Google video.
1966720	1968360	Thatís good.
1968360	1979080	Well, speaking of things that have no depth, SingStar 90s isóoh, my God, why are people
1979080	1980080	still playingó
1980080	1983200	You know what, the SingStar games donít look that bad.
1983200	1984200	I actuallyó
1984200	1985200	Oh, I played it at E3.
1985200	1986200	Yeah.
1986200	1988520	And I had to do Motorhead with some guy.
1988520	1993920	Iím more excitedóheaven forbid Iím saying Iím excited about a PlayStation 3 game, but
1993920	1996000	I think SingStar will be better on the PlayStation 3.
1996000	2000360	We can downloadólike, so that way you donít have all these frickiní CD expansion packs,
2000360	2001360	right?
2001360	2002800	Well, thank you for reading my story for me.
2002800	2004880	Oh, no, I havenít said anything about what it is.
2004880	2010680	Well, what I was going to say is that there actually is some speculation that for the
2010680	2017120	PS3 SingStar, there would be some more data for download via the download service, but
2017120	2025000	actually SingStar 90s isóactually was announced for New Zealand stores for August 3rd, soó
2025000	2026000	Yeah.
2026000	2027000	What kind of songs are in this game?
2027000	2028000	Is there a song list?
2028000	2029000	Thereís a gallery.
2029000	2032760	Oh, hereís a song list.
2032760	2038360	Never Ever, All Saints, Barbie Girl, Love Shack, One Week, Achy Breaky Heart, with a
2038360	2039880	big fat typo on the page.
2039880	2040880	This game already fails.
2040880	2041880	Unbelievable.
2041880	2044320	Hey, that was a good song.
2044320	2045800	Here Comes the Hot Stepper.
2045800	2047640	It has Stay on it.
2047640	2048640	Really?
2048640	2049640	By Shakespeareís Sister?
2049640	2050640	No, Lisa Loeb.
2050640	2051640	Oh, dammit.
2051640	2055800	You Canít Touch This, Bitch, which I donít like that song at all.
2055800	2060080	Moving On Up, Torn, Step byóoh, New Kids on the Block is on it.
2060080	2061080	Thatís cool.
2061080	2062080	This game might be interesting.
2062080	2063320	Dude, Where the Wild Roses Go.
2063320	2064560	I fucking love that song.
2064560	2065920	Is that the Nick Cave song?
2065920	2066920	And Kylie.
2066920	2067920	Yes.
2067920	2068920	Wow, thatís kind of cool.
2068920	2069920	It has Poison on it.
2069920	2070920	Wannabe.
2070920	2073640	I wonder if that game will come out in the US with that.
2073640	2074640	Dude, Radiohead!
2074640	2076640	Thatís kind of neat.
2076640	2077640	R.E.M.
2077640	2081200	It has Savage Garden, Kiss from a Rose, Baby Got Back.
2081200	2082800	Thatís funny.
2082800	2085040	Um, yeah, Zombies on it.
2085040	2086040	Zombies, Zombies.
2086040	2087040	Dude, heís got the cure.
2087040	2088040	Iím getting this game.
2088040	2089040	Zombies, Zombies, Zombies.
2089040	2090040	Okay, good.
2090040	2096240	Uh, letís see, uh, Black Boy in our chatroom says, Sing Star needs more Bjork.
2096240	2097240	I agree.
2097240	2104640	Iím a tree that grows hollow, one for it at your back.
2104640	2110040	See, I do a great impression, donít I?
2110040	2111880	What was Margaret Cho's impersonation?
2111880	2117560	Iím sorry that I tried to eat your head.
2117560	2121240	By the way, thereís this YouTube somewhere of, and I know we talked about it on the show
2121240	2124640	before, but itís worth bringing up again, itís that funny, where somebody took, because
2124640	2129720	you know Bjork one time beat the crap out of some reporter in an airport in Thailand?
2129720	2133520	Well somebody put Street Fighter graphics and music over it and itís really funny,
2133520	2134520	itís on YouTube somewhere.
2134520	2137400	Iím sure one of the chatters will dig it up somewhere.
2137400	2140720	So there it goes.
2140720	2145520	Something else you can find on the internet is a role in a movie!
2145520	2147160	Amazing!
2147160	2150960	And uh, but I donít know if you really want to be in this movie, because itís an UE Bowl
2150960	2151960	movie.
2151960	2158080	Uh, heís actually auctioning off a role on eBay for a role in Far Cry.
2158080	2166040	The bidding started at 2,498 Euros, which would translate to about $3,360 US.
2166040	2171760	And the winner would get five days on the set of the movie, and uh, unfortunately though,
2171760	2175280	they would have to cover the flight and the hotel.
2175280	2177800	So go figure that nobody bid on it!
2177800	2178800	Interesting.
2178800	2183440	If I had the money, Iíd do it.
2183440	2184440	Why?
2184440	2185440	Because.
2185440	2187040	Because youíre like, ìHey, look at that!
2187040	2192240	I was in that crappy movie!î Then I could say, ìI was in the movie and it fucking sucked!î
2192240	2196480	The official eBay page is all in German, so itís kind of hard for me to make out, but
2196480	2197480	it didnít sell.
2197480	2199920	It doesnít look like it sold.
2199920	2202280	Yeah, he sucks.
2202280	2206080	Thank you, Tigerclaw, for finding the Bjork Street Fighter video.
2206080	2207280	Awesome.
2207280	2212920	Alright, well, uh, stories about UE Bowl make us very angry, so you know what that means,
2212920	2213920	boys and girls?
2213920	2229880	Itís time for the FUs of the Week.
2229880	2231720	Dark Sakura, start us off.
2231720	2234540	What makes me angry?
2234540	2241000	What makes me angry is the check engine light coming on on my car, um, because, well, we
2241000	2245720	checked the, um, all the emissions, everything was clean, there was no problem with any of
2245720	2250000	that, so I think it just needs to spark plugs, but other than that, it was just really aggravating.
2250000	2256520	Oh, and one other thing, FU to Office Drama.
2256520	2258920	And new leather smell on my massage table.
2258920	2261520	Loki, any FUs of the Week?
2261520	2270760	Uh, yeah, FU to, um, the key flash component to VGA thing Iíve got, because it doesnít
2270760	2277040	work like it should, because, you know, my picture shouldnít be flashing on and off
2277040	2281960	on the screen, that would probably mean itís not working, so, fuck them, and fuck you for
2281960	2284560	wasting $50 of my money.
2284560	2289560	Um, my FU of the Week goes to the fact that Iím flying out to the East Coast in 48 hours,
2289560	2295320	and I havenít done any packing yet, so FU to myself for not packing yet.
2295320	2298200	Maybe after tonightís show, weíll see.
2298200	2302200	All right, letís get back into some gaming news.
2302200	2308720	Well, back to rumors and speculation.
2308720	2316720	There actually was a little bit from Famitsu announcing that several Metal Gear Solid 20th
2316720	2322800	Anniversary titles were supposed to be out, so theyíve listed for the 26th of July Metal
2322800	2333440	Gear Solid Collection for PlayStation, PS2, and PSP, also Metal Gear Solid 3 on PS2, Metal
2333440	2337200	Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear Solid 2, did I just say that?
2337200	2339800	They listed it twice.
2339800	2346480	There also is Metal Gear Solid for PlayStation and Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear
2346480	2350280	Solid Portable Ops for PSP re-releases, I guess.
2350280	2356080	Like, yay, you can just go to your used video game store and get them.
2356080	2357960	Are they going to re-do graphics or anything?
2357960	2359520	It doesnít say anything.
2359520	2360520	Lame.
2360520	2361880	So itís just basically repackaged, re-priced.
2361880	2363880	It doesnít say anything.
2363880	2364880	Whoopee!
2364880	2369800	Well, I mean, given anything released in Japan, um, thereís always the possibility of having
2369800	2375120	limited edition stuff that comes with, you know, like forks and plates and things, and
2375120	2378400	donít laugh because Iíve bought a video game that came with a fork and a plate and
2378400	2380120	a clock and a pillowcase.
2380120	2381120	What happened to the dish and the spoon?
2381120	2382120	Did they run away together?
2382120	2383440	It had a dish and a spoon with it.
2383440	2387720	It was that Cardcaptor Soccer game that came out on Dreamcast.
2387720	2392400	So I wouldnít discount the fact that, you know, something else might come out with it
2392400	2397520	to make it all kind of, ooh, special, but it doesnít say anything yet.
2397520	2401400	So Iím not going to put any stock into it until I get something official.
2401400	2406360	Well, something coming soon, or at least a rumor to be coming soon.
2406360	2410040	Tony Erickson, of course, the rumorís been going around saying that thereís going to
2410040	2412640	be a PSP phone coming soon.
2412640	2418920	Well, apparently thereís been a patent thatís been spotted on the US patent website, and
2418920	2424280	thereís some pretty hard evidence there showing kind of a prototype of something that looks
2424280	2429360	like a very thick phone thatís going to have a rotatable screen, almost looks like a PSP,
2429360	2431800	just a little bit thicker.
2431800	2435720	Very interesting, though, kind of the same stuff I think we saw before when they were
2435720	2441440	showing off like the mobile Nintendo games and stuff, you know, where you can pause the
2441440	2444960	game when you get a call and that kind of stuff.
2444960	2445960	I donít know.
2445960	2453400	Obviously no firm plans have been made yet, but something thatís coming soon, Iím guessing.
2453400	2455040	This thing looks stupid.
2455040	2458360	It makes me think of the great phone taco.
2458360	2459360	The N-Gage?
2459360	2460360	The N-Gage.
2460360	2461360	I had a phone taco.
2461360	2462360	I donít getó
2462360	2463360	What?
2463360	2464360	You had an N-Gage?
2464360	2465360	I told you I had one.
2465360	2466360	It was free.
2466360	2467360	Loser.
2467360	2469720	It was free, and we gave it away.
2469720	2470720	Cheap loser.
2470720	2474920	Oh, okay, so thatís what it would be.
2474920	2475920	That makes more sense.
2475920	2481100	It looks like what would happen is youíd actuallyóyouíd have your kind of directional
2481100	2486640	button and stuff like youíd normally have on a phone, and then that whole screen would
2486640	2490640	flip around and then you would have kind of like a PSP looking thing.
2490640	2491640	Itís neat.
2491640	2494280	I donít know if that would work very well.
2494280	2497720	It looks unwieldy and kind of crappy like the Blackberries do.
2497720	2500000	I donít know.
2500000	2501640	Just you know, PSPs arenít that expensive.
2501640	2503280	Just stick with the PSP.
2503280	2504680	Turn the PSP into a phone.
2504680	2505680	There you go.
2505680	2508600	How about get a phone, get a PSP.
2508600	2513680	I would rather have a phone that I can do two things on.
2513680	2514680	Number one, call people.
2514680	2515680	Number two, text message.
2515680	2516680	Thatís frickiní it.
2516680	2522200	Thatís why I paid 30 bucks for my phone, and I have a nice phone, but if I want to
2522200	2526320	play a video game, then Iíll just get something thatís dedicated to video games.
2526320	2529880	I can take pictures with my phone, which is fine because I have a camera and all, but
2529880	2533200	sometimes you can take pictures with your camera phone when people donít know it.
2533200	2536040	Okay, that would be a number three.
2536040	2537040	That would be a number three.
2537040	2543200	But seriously, this iPhone crap and this PSP phone crap, why donít you just get a PSP
2543200	2545680	or get an iPod?
2545680	2546680	How hard is it?
2546680	2547920	PSPs are pretty large too.
2547920	2549920	I wouldnít really want to use it as a phone.
2549920	2555240	Now if somebody gave me an iPhone, I wouldnít disagree, or if I got a big fat discount on
2555240	2558920	one, I wouldnít disagree, but it was not something that I think is worth 600 bucks
2558920	2563000	for, and neither would this PSP phone thing be.
2563000	2568160	I have a phone that works, and I have one PSP, and I have a bunch of DSís.
2568160	2569360	You could probably just play whatever.
2569360	2573680	You could probably buy a pretty nice phone for $600, not Apple brand.
2573680	2575240	Iíd like to think my phone was pretty nice.
2575240	2577920	It was only 200 bucks a year ago.
2577920	2584640	I could buy a full GPS system with built-in headphones to talk to anybody in the world
2584640	2587400	for enough money, but why would I want to do that?
2587400	2589060	I have my phone.
2589060	2590400	I think that all of this is ridiculous.
2590400	2594820	Itís just because people are tech addicts and need to have something that does more
2594820	2596440	than it needs to do.
2596440	2602400	All right, well on that PSP, you could play this.
2602400	2607140	Also being reported in Famitsu is that a new version of Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins is
2607140	2608560	coming out for the PSP.
2608560	2612560	Itís coming out in Japan, and theyíre redoing it.
2612560	2616760	Itís going to be making the game a little closer to its arcade roots.
2616760	2621140	The number of continues is going to be limited, and players will be forced to complete the
2621140	2625000	game twice before seeing the ending.
2625000	2629120	In other words, theyíve made this game even harder than it was before.
2629120	2630120	Wow.
2630120	2632720	It was pretty hard before.
2632720	2633720	So there you have it.
2633720	2635440	Ghosts and Goblins, it better be hard.
2635440	2638600	So August 2nd is the day the game is coming out.
2638600	2643040	No import plans announced yet for the game to come out in North America, but we can all
2643040	2646920	hold our breath, and maybe weíll get it.
2646920	2649960	But Iím sure itíll be dumbed down and made easy, just like most of the games they bring
2649960	2650960	over from Japan.
2650960	2651960	Who knows?
2651960	2652960	Maybe weíll die first.
2652960	2653960	All right.
2653960	2656960	One more story, then weíre going to get to our Skype line.
2656960	2662260	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can call us, Orange Lounge Radio is
2662260	2663260	our user name.
2663260	2664260	Iím sorry, two more stories.
2664260	2667280	Orange Lounge Radio is our user name on Skype.
2667280	2668280	Two more stories.
2668280	2669280	My bad.
2669280	2679200	Well, at any rate, the ñ you remember the whole Second Life exploitation that was going
2679200	2680200	on?
2680200	2682080	Didnít we cover that last week?
2682080	2683080	Did it involve cock-throwing?
2683080	2684080	No.
2684080	2694160	Well, at any rate, a Pennsylvania attorney is taking Linden Labs to court because theyíre
2694160	2701640	ñ sheís saying that they illegally took away the items that were supposed to have
2701640	2706400	been acquired during ñ let me see the quote ñ allegedly acquired using an exploit by
2706400	2708920	an SL user.
2708920	2717120	He was banned, lost everything, and the court actually is denying the request to dismiss
2717120	2718120	the case.
2718120	2719840	Theyíve denied it twice.
2719840	2724480	Thereís actually a big quote on here that says, ìThe case will still need to play out
2724480	2729760	and only concerns the sum of $8,000.00, however, it appears that greater scrutiny and enforcement
2729760	2734480	of commerce within Second Life and other virtual worlds is possible and may be necessary.
2734480	2739640	The commerce, largely characterized by pyramid schemes, faulty valuations, and unreal exchange
2739640	2743520	rates could be subject to real-world law.î So ñ
2743520	2746600	Thatís what he made, Third Life.
2746600	2747920	Yeah, for people who donít want to ñ
2747920	2749880	Second Life is too real for you.
2749880	2751320	Go to Third Life.
2751320	2756000	So if someone steals all my equipment in World of Warcraft, I can sue them over it?
2756000	2758760	Thatíll be kind of cool, I guess.
2758760	2759760	Maybe.
2759760	2760760	Interesting.
2760760	2767400	Iím suing you for vandalizing my building by throwing cocks at it.
2767400	2768400	Damn you.
2768400	2769700	Damn you to hell.
2769700	2774440	If someone threw cocks at me, Iíd sue them.
2774440	2776840	Iím thinking I should sue these guys.
2776840	2781200	Theyíre masters.
2781200	2785920	They never seem to fail me when it comes to thinking up video game ideas.
2785920	2788600	Theyíre creating Dirty Dancing, the video game.
2788600	2792280	Yes, thatís right, Dirty Dancing.
2792280	2798560	Such a wonderful game, and I donít know what the hell they could be doing with this.
2798560	2809520	Great idea if they pull it off, but I really wish they put this baby in the corner.
2809520	2813260	But apparently it says, ìWorking alongside a team at Kellermanís Resort, play through
2813260	2819240	a fantastic variety of fun mini-games, earned camp dollars to purchase Dirty Dancing memorabilia,
2819240	2824280	cabin furnishings, and all-important dance lessons with Johnny and Penny.
2824280	2828640	How will you fare in the end of the season dance contest?î
2828640	2832160	Didnít they already try bringing back the Dirty Dancing franchise with that Havana Nights
2832160	2833680	movie or whatever it was that tanked?
2833680	2837480	I donít know if it tanked, but yeah.
2837480	2839200	I agree with Wonder Dog Harold.
2839200	2845200	Wonder Dog Harold says, ìI want Mannequin, the video game.î Hell yeah.
2845200	2848280	With that one guy with the glasses, what the hell was his name?
2848280	2854400	The really flamey guy in the movie that was like the assistóoh, God, I know somebodyís
2854400	2855400	going to yell it in chat.
2855400	2856400	I know it.
2856400	2860240	Thatís what I want to see, Mannequin, the video game.
2860240	2861240	Thatís great.
2861240	2862240	All right.
2862240	2864120	Would you play Dirty Dancing, the video game?
2864120	2867120	Maybe this is what happened to X-Tango.
2867120	2868120	I donít know.
2868120	2869120	I want X-Tango.
2869120	2872120	Would you play Dirty Dancing, the game, Darzagra?
2872120	2873120	No.
2873120	2874120	All right.
2874120	2875120	It was Meshach Taylor.
2875120	2877320	Yeah, that was theóHollywood was his name.
2877320	2878320	Thank you.
2878320	2881240	Thank God his name was Hollywood.
2881240	2882240	Thank you, Black Boy.
2882240	2883240	All right.
2883240	2885680	Letís get to the Skype line, shall we?
2885680	2891800	If youíd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge
2891800	2892800	Radio.
2892800	2898440	The phones are now open for business, so give us a call.
2898440	2899560	Weíll just sit here and wait.
2899560	2900560	Okay, great.
2900560	2901560	We got some calls coming in already.
2901560	2903440	Thereís a little bit of a delay, so it takes a minute.
2903440	2904440	Hi.
2904440	2905440	Youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.
2905440	2906440	Whoís this?
2906440	2907440	Yeah, you already know.
2907440	2908440	Itís Legend of Zaku.
2908440	2909440	Hey, Zaku.
2909440	2910440	How you doing?
2910440	2913920	What do you think aboutónow, I know youíre into cell phone games.
2913920	2917240	What do you think about Leisure Suit Larry on the mobile phones?
2917240	2924080	I havenít seen it yet, but I would assume it has to be text and graphics-based, where
2924080	2932560	you just have toóbasically, text and images, itís basically the whole premise of cell
2932560	2938520	phone games just to garner the casual gamerís attention, but yeah, if it works out, thatís
2938520	2939520	great.
2939520	2940520	Maybe some pixelated boobies.
2940520	2941520	Who knows?
2941520	2942520	Anywayó
2942520	2943520	Perhaps.
2943520	2944520	What did you call in about tonight, Zaku?
2944520	2951480	You know, just random stuff, like the fact thatóI forgot what I was going to sayóyeah,
2951480	2959120	itís likeóI donít know, I was just getting about Tekken 6 and the fact that all the rumors
2959120	2966240	about it going to the 360, just in general of how the state of affairs is with trying
2966240	2973080	to make games, that weíre starting to lose exclusives because everythingís going multi-platform.
2973080	2975520	Let me ask Dark Soccer a little bit about this, because youíre right.
2975520	2977840	We didnít talk about Tekken 6 tonight at all.
2977840	2981320	It just kind of missed our show role, but there was a story about Tekken 6 earlier this
2981320	2984900	week, just some screenshots coming out, and now the rumor is saying that it will be on
2984900	2989280	PlayStation 3, but coming to the 360 a little bit later, so I know youíre a big Tekken
2989280	2990280	fan, girl.
2990280	2991280	What is it, Tek?
2991280	2992280	Dark Soccer, what do you think?
2992280	3000320	Iíd still just stick with it on PS3 myself, just because I think itíll look a little
3000320	3004760	bit better, play a little bit better, and that Namco has just been all about Sony, soó
3004760	3010080	Yeah, thatís what I was thinking, but then you also have Ace Combat 6, which is 360.
3010080	3016400	Itís a timed exclusive, which the PS3 version will come afterwards, so itís kind of like
3016400	3017400	the universe.
3017400	3022080	It probably also helps that Tekken 6 arcade hardware is built off the PlayStation 3, so
3022080	3025680	itís probably pretty simple to port it over to the PlayStation 3.
3025680	3030360	It might take a little longer for Xbox 360, but theyíre not dumb.
3030360	3033280	Obviously theyíre going to put it over on the 360 at some point.
3033280	3041240	And if you looked at the recent mini E3 lineup list that they had, apparently, I donít know,
3041240	3047040	itís just like all I see is very few exclusive PS3 games from other companies.
3047040	3050600	I mean, obviously Sony is the only one making their own PS3 games.
3050600	3051600	Well, who knows, though.
3051600	3053360	Sony may have some surprises in store.
3053360	3058600	You canít reallyóI mean, usually the announcements about what weíre going to see at E3 is shit
3058600	3063040	we already know about that was delayed from last year, so a lot of itís going to be surprises,
3063040	3068080	but Iím assuming if E3 operates any similar way this year than it did last year, which
3068080	3069080	Iím assuming will be the same thing.
3069080	3071240	Chances are itís going to be much smaller, much more closed.
3071240	3072240	Well, besides that, I mean, the wayó
3072240	3073240	Weíre probably going to get like third-hand information.
3073240	3076320	But Iím saying the way the news works, you know?
3076320	3077320	Right.
3077320	3078320	I think that will still kind of pretty much be the same thing.
3078320	3079320	The big boys will get in.
3079320	3081320	Weíll have to feed off of them eventually.
3081320	3083120	Yeah, well, you know.
3083120	3086160	At some point, the rest of the internet will get fed up with it, but weíll just wait.
3086160	3087160	All right.
3087160	3089680	Well, anyway, Zach, anything else on your mind before we take some other calls?
3089680	3091560	Thatís about it.
3091560	3094200	We New Yorkers have 2DX Happy Sky in the arcades.
3094200	3095200	Oh, where at?
3095200	3100880	The same place where we find the only pop music machine in the city, Peter Pan Games
3100880	3101880	in Queens.
3101880	3104640	I might have to look that place up while Iím out there.
3104640	3105640	Weíll see.
3105640	3106640	All right.
3106640	3107640	All right.
3107640	3108640	Later, Zaku.
3108640	3109640	Bye.
3109640	3110640	All right.
3110640	3113160	If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3113160	3116320	Letís go to the phones and take another call.
3116320	3117880	Hello.
3117880	3118880	You are on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3118880	3119880	Whoís this?
3119880	3120880	Hey, hey, hey.
3120880	3121880	Hi, Emma.
3121880	3122880	Hey, Rama.
3122880	3123880	How you doing?
3123880	3124880	Hi.
3124880	3125880	How are you doing?
3125880	3126880	Hi, everyone.
3126880	3127880	How did you enjoy your trip out to California?
3127880	3128880	Oh, it was fucking awesome.
3128880	3129880	I loved it.
3129880	3130880	Seriously.
3130880	3131880	Yeah.
3131880	3132880	Weíre having a hard time hearing you, Rama.
3132880	3133880	Get a little closer to your microphone.
3133880	3134880	I said I had fun.
3134880	3135880	I enjoyed it very much.
3135880	3136880	Good deal.
3136880	3139880	I wanted to somehow make my way out there for a weekend just to have fun.
3139880	3140880	Weíre a fun bunch here.
3140880	3142880	Well, what did you want to call in and talk about tonight?
3142880	3148080	Well, one of the things anybodyís been bitching on me about are pictures, so Iím posting a
3148080	3150800	link in the chat room right now for the pictures.
3150800	3153400	Oh, do you have pictures of the panel and stuff?
3153400	3155280	I have a few pictures of the panel.
3155280	3156280	Nice.
3156280	3157280	Itís djronemas.mypockybox.com.
3157280	3158280	My Pocky Box?
3158280	3159280	Yeah.
3159280	3160280	Thatís cute.
3160280	3161280	Mypockybox.com.
3161280	3162280	Forward slash gallery.
3162280	3163280	Forward slash Fonomay2007.
3163280	3164280	Awesome.
3164280	3174480	Iím looking at some of the pictures right now.
3174480	3176120	You got tons and tons of cosplayers.
3176120	3178880	What was some of your favorite cosplay you saw?
3178880	3184440	I have to be biased, but I was really going for the Ron and the One-Half cosplays because
3184440	3188560	thereís been a while where not many people are cosplaying that series, but now lately
3188560	3191200	this is making one hell of a comeback.
3191200	3193520	The series is kind of old though, right?
3193520	3196720	Yeah, but great series like that never old.
3196720	3203520	Now, one of the favorite pieces of cosplay I saw was actually Jonas, whoís been on OLR
3203520	3204520	before.
3204520	3205520	Heís been on this program before.
3205520	3207360	He cosplayed as a Wii remote.
3207360	3208360	And he was actuallyó
3208360	3209360	Yeah, that was him.
3209360	3210360	You believe it?
3210360	3211360	That was awesome.
3211360	3212360	Yeah.
3212360	3214560	He was actually going to come to the show tonight, but I donít think he got the address
3214560	3217400	in time of where weíre at now because weíve been in like four different studios.
3217400	3220360	He hasnít been on the show in a long time, but yeah, that was one of my favorite pieces
3220360	3221360	of cosplay.
3221360	3223480	Oh my God, thereís the Dolphy pictures.
3223480	3226040	Iím trying to findóoh, thereís the OLR panel.
3226040	3227040	Here we are.
3227040	3230800	Oh, Sky, who are you choking in this picture?
3230800	3231800	Which one?
3231800	3232800	Let me look.
3232800	3233800	Number 124.
3233800	3234800	I just posted it.
3234800	3236880	Iím going to look.
3236880	3238120	Who am I choking in this picture?
3238120	3239120	Thatís Drew Nami.
3239120	3241680	I thought Drew Nami was on the other side.
3241680	3242680	No, thatís Drew.
3242680	3243680	Oh, thatís cool.
3243680	3247240	You got a bunch of like Orange Lawns radio listeners there.
3247240	3248240	Thatís cool.
3248240	3249240	I like that.
3249240	3250240	Definitely.
3250240	3251240	Very nice.
3251240	3252240	One of my friends, Ken, he took the picture for all of us.
3252240	3253240	Great.
3253240	3255560	Yeah, I noticed that there was a lot of folks there from chat room, like I recognize some
3255560	3256560	of the folks.
3256560	3257560	Awesome.
3257560	3260080	I didnít know you took a picture of my Dolphys on the table.
3260080	3263160	Yeah, you asked me to do it.
3263160	3265520	No, the one in the hotel room.
3265520	3266520	Oh, yeah.
3266520	3268320	Oh, I thought you knew about that one.
3268320	3269320	No, but thatís cool.
3269320	3270320	Itís a good picture.
3270320	3271320	Oh, thatís sweet.
3271320	3272320	All right.
3272320	3274840	Anything else you want to share with us, Rama?
3274840	3279000	The last picture of you and William together in the chat room, the one that everybody loves.
3279000	3280000	Thank you very much.
3280000	3281000	Thatís very sweet.
3281000	3282000	Youíre welcome.
3282000	3283000	Oh, God.
3283000	3284000	Is that in the gallery?
3284000	3285000	Yes.
3285000	3286000	Are you putting personal pictures?
3286000	3287000	All right.
3287000	3288000	Thatís my trip picture still.
3288000	3289000	All right.
3289000	3290240	I see, because at the very end, oh, yeah, Dark Sakuraís pinball.
3290240	3291240	All that stuff at her house.
3291240	3292240	Yes.
3292240	3293240	All the crazy pinball in her place.
3293240	3294240	Oh, yeah.
3294240	3295240	Thereís my friend John.
3295240	3296240	How funny.
3296240	3299400	I decided next year, though, that Iím going to do Lolita Mario.
3299400	3300400	Oh, yes.
3300400	3303520	Dude, the gosh-a-mon cosplayers, thatís great.
3303520	3304520	Of course.
3304520	3305520	All right.
3305520	3307480	Well, Rama, thanks so much for coming out.
3307480	3311160	You are a true fan, pretty hardcore, for coming out all the way to California to see the Orange
3311160	3316800	Lounge panel and hang with us and go to Fonomay and all that, too, but youíre just awesome.
3316800	3317800	Thatís all.
3317800	3320360	Well, plus, it was my birthday the day before.
3320360	3323120	This was originally like a giant birthday gift to myself.
3323120	3324120	True that.
3324120	3325120	Well, happy late birthday a little bit.
3325120	3326120	Yeah.
3326120	3327120	Yeah.
3327120	3328840	Iíll be seeing you this weekend, a couple of coming weekends.
3328840	3329840	Yeah, definitely.
3329840	3330840	All right.
3330840	3334200	I will be posting a forum so we can get things cracking for that.
3334200	3335200	All right.
3335200	3337200	Just make sure it happens Sunday afternoon, because thatís the time I got.
3337200	3338200	Sure.
3338200	3339200	No problem.
3339200	3340200	All right.
3340200	3341200	Sounds good.
3341200	3342200	All right.
3342200	3343200	Later.
3343200	3344200	Later.
3344200	3345200	All right.
3345200	3346200	Letís go to some more calls.
3346200	3347200	Hello.
3347200	3348200	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3348200	3349200	Whoís this?
3349200	3350200	Ravenstaufen.
3350200	3351200	Hello, Ravenstaufen.
3351200	3352200	Whatís on your mind?
3352200	3353200	Match game.
3353200	3354200	Yeah.
3354200	3355200	What about match game?
3355200	3361000	I donít know if you realize, but GSM, when they used to do match game online, and I was
3361000	3365840	really good at it, and I got on the board on TV that said your name on it, I was heavily
3365840	3368200	addicted to that for a long, long time.
3368200	3370240	Donít they still do that?
3370240	3377800	Yeah, but Comcast being dicks, they took off GSM entirely down here, and Iím pissed.
3377800	3378880	Oh, that sucks.
3378880	3379880	So thatís kind of cool.
3379880	3380880	Yeah, thatís right.
3380880	3386160	You know, we donít talk a whole lot about casual games on the show, certainly, but thatís
3386160	3390720	pretty cool that they have the, you know, you can play along with the game shows and
3390720	3391720	stuff.
3391720	3392720	Iíve actually never done that.
3392720	3393720	I should sometime.
3393720	3395600	I love myself some game show network, so there you go.
3395600	3400640	Yeah, but we cheated sometimes because some people had the, they watch it so many times,
3400640	3405080	they write down the answers, and they would post it up in the chat room, and we would
3405080	3406480	get on the leaderboard every time.
3406480	3407480	It was great.
3407480	3408480	Awesome.
3408480	3411480	What else do you want to share with us tonight?
3411480	3413920	What else do I want to share with you tonight?
3413920	3415800	Letís see.
3415800	3416800	Not much.
3416800	3422080	I just want to just point that out, and thatís about it.
3422080	3424600	Thereís no one more thing tonight?
3424600	3426920	Well, I updated my website.
3426920	3428800	You want to hear about that?
3428800	3429800	Sure, why not?
3429800	3430800	Cheap website plug.
3430800	3431800	Go for it.
3431800	3432800	Make it quick.
3432800	3433800	Checkinggame.com.
3433800	3436040	Oh, I just remembered what I want to talk to you about.
3436040	3437040	All right, there you go.
3437040	3438040	What?
3438040	3439040	Hotel Gus.
3439040	3440040	Room 215.
3440040	3444400	I donít know much about, well, I mean, I take that back.
3444400	3445480	I know about the game.
3445480	3450240	I havenít played the game because itís just one of those games that is, you know, I canít
3450240	3452120	play every game that comes out.
3452120	3453120	What about it though?
3453120	3457040	Itís not like Phoenix Wright, but I enjoy it.
3457040	3459540	I thought it was very enjoyable.
3459540	3461240	What makes it so enjoyable?
3461240	3466320	Well, you play this guy called Kyle Hyde, and he goes to his place, and the room is
3466320	3467320	magical.
3467320	3469800	So this room grants wishes.
3469800	3473840	So he goes in there, he doesnít know anything, and Iím not going to spoil anything.
3473840	3478620	So he goes in there, and heís trying to find something out about his friend.
3478620	3482440	So itís very interesting how all of this comes together.
3482440	3483440	Interesting.
3483440	3486600	Well, I mean, I know Mieglatov has the game, so Iíll have to borrow it from him at some
3486600	3489240	point and give a more fair review on the show later.
3489240	3494040	Yeah, itís very enjoyable, I thought, but it is a lot of reading.
3494040	3499500	So for you people that hate Super Paper Mario, youíre probably going to hate this too.
3499500	3502880	Do you hate Super Paper Mario because thereís too much reading, Loki?
3502880	3504440	No, thereís not.
3504440	3506600	Well, there is a lot of reading in the game.
3506600	3509320	Itís because it gets too repetitive towards the end.
3509320	3512960	Thereís actual parts in the game where the whole world disappears, and then you have
3512960	3518680	to run along blankness for about a few minutes, and itís kind of annoying.
3518680	3526360	Or the Pit of 100 Trials, I know itís a side quest, but itís like 90 minutes of just fighting
3526360	3527800	enemies over 100 levels.
3527800	3528800	Itís kind of annoying.
3528800	3529800	Interesting.
3529800	3530800	All right.
3530800	3531800	Well, anything else real quick, Ravenstaufen?
3531800	3532800	Iím looking at Ramaís pictures in the background.
3532800	3533800	Anything else, Ravenstaufen?
3533800	3534800	Oh, sorry.
3534800	3535800	Sorry.
3535800	3536800	Thatís all right.
3536800	3543800	Yeah, I just updated my website, and I just want people to know how it looks, techiegames.com.
3543800	3544800	All right.
3544800	3545800	There it is.
3545800	3546800	All right.
3546800	3547800	Well, thank you so much for the phone call.
3547800	3548800	Have a great day.
3548800	3549800	Bye.
3549800	3550800	Bye.
3550800	3551800	All right.
3551800	3552800	Bye.
3552800	3553800	All right.
3553800	3554800	If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge
3554800	3555800	Radio.
3555800	3556800	Hi.
3556800	3557800	Youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.
3557800	3558800	Whoís this?
3558800	3559800	Hey.
3559800	3560800	This is BlackDevilRX.
3560800	3561800	Hello, BlackDevilRX.
3561800	3562800	Whatís on your mind?
3562800	3563800	Not much.
3563800	3572520	Iím trying to get a Wii, but San Francisco seems to be out of Wiis.
3572520	3573520	You know what?
3573520	3577280	So does Sacramento and a lot of areas seem to still be out of Wiis after all this time.
3577280	3579840	Matt, you can give us the distribution angle here, I suppose.
3579840	3581040	What the hellís going on?
3581040	3582640	Thereís still some coming in.
3582640	3584040	Itís just slow.
3584040	3588160	Itís still everythingís under allocations and everything.
3588160	3592920	Is there a particular time thatís best to check, like Sunday mornings seem to be pretty
3592920	3593920	good?
3593920	3594920	No, not really.
3594920	3597920	I was called with Virgin, and they were like, ìOh, well, we have 20 on Backorder.î
3597920	3603080	A lot of places are keeping them under wraps until Sundays when they put out their ads.
3603080	3604080	Thatís why.
3604080	3605920	For a lot of retail chains.
3605920	3608760	EB Games hasnít seen one for two weeks.
3608760	3609760	Wow.
3609760	3610760	Have you thought about it?
3610760	3616000	Can you still do pre-orders with these guys, or do they not do that anymore?
3616000	3617000	I donít know.
3617000	3622320	I kind of hesitate to do stuff online because I kind of had a real bad experience with it,
3622320	3625440	but I suppose thatís one thing I could do.
3625440	3629560	James Patrick in chat says, ìMy Toys R Us got 200 of them on Memorial Day.
3629560	3631520	I was there trying to get one.
3631520	3633440	Sold out in 30 minutes.î
3633440	3635220	Thatís crazy.
3635220	3636320	My God.
3636320	3637640	After all this time?
3637640	3638640	Seriously?
3638640	3639640	Wow.
3639640	3643080	I guess that just goes to show, Wiiís still a pretty darn successful system.
3643080	3644080	Itís pretty amazing.
3644080	3645080	Itís amazing.
3645080	3646840	Iím going to get one for myself as a graduation present.
3646840	3648680	Well, what have you been playing since youíre Wii-less?
3648680	3653920	Actually, Iíve been playing a lot of Super Smash Brothers on the GameCube.
3653920	3655180	There you go.
3655180	3657440	In anticipation for the new one on the Wii someday?
3657440	3658440	There you go.
3658440	3662520	What do you think about all the stuff theyíve announced on the site recently, like the musicians
3662520	3666280	and the power-ups and all that, and using the GameCube controller?
3666280	3669080	I havenít actually checked out the site lately, but Iíve heard that Snakeís going to be
3669080	3670400	in there, which is kind of cool.
3670400	3671400	All right.
3671400	3672400	Very cool.
3672400	3675160	I hope they have more of those single-player type modes.
3675160	3678880	Remember how they had the old-school Mario level that you played Mario?
3678880	3679880	Oh, yeah.
3679880	3680880	That stuff was so cool.
3680880	3682520	I hope they have more of that.
3682520	3683520	All right.
3683520	3685800	Well, BlackDevlerX, thank you so much for the call, and good luck on your hunt for a
3685800	3686800	Wii.
3686800	3687800	Try Sunday mornings.
3687800	3688800	Thatís the best advice we got.
3688800	3689800	All right.
3689800	3690800	All right.
3690800	3691800	Later, dude.
3691800	3692800	All right.
3692800	3698200	If you would like to give us a call, you can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user
3698200	3700320	name is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.
3700320	3704760	Weíll take one more call here, and then weíre going to go ahead and call it a night on the
3704760	3709560	Skype line and do some last-minute stories, although it does seem to me itís been kind
3709560	3711320	of a slow news week, huh?
3711320	3712320	Little bit.
3712320	3713320	Compared to usual.
3713320	3714320	Maybe itís because of Memorial Day.
3714320	3715320	It kind of got in the way.
3715320	3720080	A lot of folks, video game employees, want to go camping too, so there you go.
3720080	3721080	All right.
3721080	3722080	I saw some other calls coming in.
3722080	3723080	I saw some others hitting on the line.
3723080	3725800	God, my pinball room is hot.
3725800	3726800	It really is.
3726800	3732480	And thereís pictures of my garage with my amazing washing machine with my laundry in
3732480	3733480	it.
3733480	3735120	Thereís pictures of my huge ass on there.
3735120	3738520	God, it looks horrible.
3738520	3739760	My ass doesnít look so bad in that picture.
3739760	3741560	You see that Rocky and Bullinkle machine?
3741560	3742560	Uh-huh.
3742560	3743560	Thatís mine.
3743560	3744560	Thatís an awesome machine.
3744560	3745560	I like that.
3745560	3747920	The Twilight Zoneís mine too because the play board was made on my birthday.
3747920	3752320	Now, I wish they would have gotten a shot of the bride and pinball machine because it
3752320	3754320	was all in pieces.
3754320	3755320	Yeah.
3755320	3757280	It was being shopped out.
3757280	3762120	I think it has some problem with the brideís face because we had it all pulled out.
3762120	3764240	Dan or Will could probably tell you better what was going on with it.
3764240	3765240	Crazy.
3765240	3766240	All right.
3766240	3767240	We finally get another call.
3767240	3768240	Letís take this.
3768240	3769240	This will be our last call.
3769240	3770240	Hi.
3770240	3771240	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
3771240	3772240	Whoís this?
3772240	3773240	I donít time.
3773240	3774240	I got through.
3774240	3775240	Gee, whoís Dark Knight?
3775240	3776240	Hey, Dark Knight.
3776240	3777240	Itís just a timing thing.
3777240	3779560	Itís like a minute and a half and weíre sitting here going, ìDuh, duh, duh, duh,
3779560	3780560	duh, duh.î Well, you got through.
3780560	3781560	Whatís on your mind, buddy?
3781560	3787200	I want to talk about something I posted on the website recently about a price cut in
3787200	3789520	Lumen Falls next-gen system.
3789520	3790520	Okay.
3790520	3798080	I mean, I would think that I knew it was coming, but this early was kind of a shocker.
3798080	3800080	Being this early was kind of a big shocker to me.
3800080	3801080	Wait.
3801080	3802080	Read that by me again because you were breaking up a little.
3802080	3803080	You say price cuts?
3803080	3804080	Yeah.
3804080	3808120	I said there might be a possible next-gen price cut.
3808120	3811640	What makes this information more substantial than that?
3811640	3815520	To be fair, it seems like every month weíre getting some rumor of an upcoming price cut
3815520	3817640	and we have yet to really see a big one.
3817640	3823240	I mean, basically, the latest I got was that they said that Microsoft was going to go first
3823240	3827280	at the end of the summer and like a $50 drop.
3827280	3831840	I would honestly think Microsoftís in a safe place right now until Sony drops it.
3831840	3832840	Well, I donít know.
3832840	3835960	I think Microsoft wants to try and get down there to compete with the Wii a little more
3835960	3840440	because honestly, if they dropped their core by $50, theyíd be the same price as a Wii,
3840440	3841440	right?
3841440	3842440	Thatís what they was intending.
3842440	3846520	They wanted to be at least the same price as a Wii, the core.
3846520	3847840	I donít see why not.
3847840	3848920	That seems to make a lot of sense.
3848920	3849920	What do you think, Loki?
3849920	3852960	Again, I want your angle on this because youíre kind of on the inside in this.
3852960	3856680	Well, I donít think that they have any firm plans on dropping any price, but obviously,
3856680	3860840	theyíre probably going to be ready to if other companies do it.
3860840	3864120	Some console makers are probably going to have to drop the price of their system, but
3864120	3867120	then again, all these analysts just saying, ìOh, thereís a price drop coming.î Yeah,
3867120	3868640	thereís a price drop coming eventually.
3868640	3871520	Theyíre just trying to get out there and say, ìHey, see?
3871520	3872520	We called it.
3872520	3874920	Weíre really good at analyzing stuff.
3874920	3878160	Look at us.î I would say, because weíre analysts, too,
3878160	3879160	of sorts.
3879160	3882200	I mean, really, what do we do on this show for the past five years, right?
3882200	3887140	So I would say if a price cutís coming, itís going to be just before the Christmas rush.
3887140	3891920	So I would say, honestly, price cuts, I think end of summer is a good call, September.
3891920	3895960	I would say youíre going to see some massive price cuts in September, but when I say maybe
3895960	3900920	like 50 bucks, 50 bucks on the 360 and the Wii, maybe even, especially if itísÖ
3900920	3901920	Oh, no.
3901920	3906040	The source I got at it from, they said Nintendo might not, would probably not think about
3906040	3911340	it, but maybe like just maybe the 360 and the PS3, possibly.
3911340	3913040	What if Nintendo announced this?
3913040	3916080	Because we still know the Wiis are coming in different colors, right?
3916080	3917080	Yeah.
3917080	3921080	Theyíll release the Wiis in different colors with no game included, $199.
3921080	3922080	There you go.
3922080	3923080	Yeah.
3923080	3924080	That would be good.
3924080	3925080	Yeah?
3925080	3928880	I think I could do it right there or put in some other type of pack-in, like, I donít
3928880	3929880	know, demos or I donít know.
3929880	3933840	But yeah, just take Wii Sports out of the picture, charge $199 for the colored Wiis.
3933840	3934840	Yeah.
3934840	3936840	I could probably see that happening.
3936840	3937840	There you go.
3937840	3942800	I mean, it just, I mean, I knew it was coming, but I kind of figured maybe you might see
3942800	3947320	like maybe another year, at least.
3947320	3952560	Iím telling you, by September, $50 price cuts on Wii and 360, $100 price cut on PS3.
3952560	3953560	Yeah.
3953560	3955360	If I was a bad man, there it is.
3955360	3957440	I say a $100 price cut on PS3.
3957440	3958440	They have to.
3958440	3959440	They have to.
3959440	3960440	Yeah, I know.
3960440	3963840	Then again, they donít have to, actually, because what they could do is just, since
3963840	3970200	theyíve already dropped their 60 gig or whatever, dropped the 80 gig at the same price as their
3970200	3971200	60 and maybe doÖ
3971200	3972760	Throw in a game or something to make it.
3972760	3977840	Well, not necessarily throw it in a game, but do the 20 gig price for the 60 gig now.
3977840	3982400	Okay, then if they donít cut it by 100, theyíll put something in there to sweeten the deal.
3982400	3983400	That would be theÖ
3983400	3984400	Right.
3984400	3987080	Like maybe theyíll drop it by 50, but put $50 worth of extra crap in it, like another
3987080	3988080	game.
3988080	3989840	The hard drive increase, like youíre saying, is something like that.
3989840	3990840	I could see that.
3990840	3992760	But Sonyís going to have to do something to sweeten the deal.
3992760	3993760	Yeah.
3993760	3998760	I mean, worst case scenario is that if, like I said, PlayStation 3 does make that cut,
3998760	4002680	you probably going to see the PS2 hit the $99 mark.
4002680	4005320	And then N-Gageís, theyíre going to have to give them away for free.
4005320	4006320	Yeah.
4006320	4011160	Because thatís the only way Dark Soccer ever touched one was she got it for free.
4011160	4015160	And honestly, they may have to pay me $20 to take an N-Gage.
4015160	4020400	I mean, I saw the thing and I was like, ìI canít believe you told that.î You exactly
4020400	4021400	told that.
4021400	4022400	All right.
4022400	4024720	Well, thank you so much Dark Knight for your call and weíll see what happens on the price
4024720	4025720	cut front.
4025720	4026720	All right?
4026720	4027720	All right.
4027720	4028720	Thank you.
4028720	4029720	All right.
4029720	4030720	Take care, buddy.
4030720	4031720	Bye.
4031720	4032720	Bye.
4032720	4033720	Bye.
4033720	4034720	Bye.
4034720	4035720	Lots and lots of comments from chat here.
4035720	4036720	Letís see.
4036720	4039480	Rob D. says, ìI wouldnít be enjoying my 360 half as much if I wasnít a member of
4039480	4040480	an online community.
4040480	4044080	The Wii doesnít really have much of anything going for it at the moment beyond the Virtual
4044080	4046280	Console.î Interesting.
4046280	4050200	James Patrick says, ìPlayStation 2 wonít drop to $99 for a while.
4050200	4057360	Sony needs the profit from its current price.î Letís see.
4057360	4062440	James Patrick says, ìPlayStation 3 sales are in the gutter that needs to increase.
4062440	4068000	Software-wise, I mean, hardware is important too, but software is what counts.î Black
4068000	4073960	Boy says, ìThe 360 has been out considerably longer than the Wii, but in terms of sales,
4073960	4079880	Wii is outselling 360 by crazy amounts.î Very interesting perspectives there in chat.
4079880	4085960	BlackDevil or X says, ìWeíre using the Dreamcast as the minimum bar for sales.î Interesting.
4085960	4088400	All right.
4088400	4091960	Of course, if you have more comments, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeontrader.com,
4091960	4095820	and weíll read those emails next week on theÖ actually, not next week, but in two
4095820	4099280	weeks on the program, because a reminder, there will be no show next week.
4099280	4102400	Letís go around and see if thereís any last-minute stories.
4102400	4105240	Actually, I found something interesting.
4105240	4106240	Yes.
4106240	4111520	Just some early pictures of the Guitar Hero 3 Les Paul controller.
4111520	4112520	Pretty freaking cool.
4112520	4114880	Whatís so special about it?
4114880	4118520	Well, itís, you know, theyíve done two other Gibson guitars.
4118520	4124760	They did, you know, probably one of, in my opinion, one of their best, but Iíll, actually
4124760	4127640	Iím going to link the article in the chatroom so they can see the pictures.
4127640	4132480	It actually looks really sweet, and the buttons on it are black with the colored outlines.
4132480	4139960	Itís really a lot different than the other controllers have looked, more minimalist.
4139960	4144080	All right.
4144080	4145080	Anything else?
4145080	4146080	No.
4146080	4147080	Loki.
4147080	4152000	Anyway, so, I actually got quite a few things.
4152000	4155200	First off, some interesting stuff coming out.
4155200	4160640	Well, first off, thereís supposed to be a rumor that the next issue of EGM is going
4160640	4167000	to reveal a brand-new Soul Calibur title, not Soul Calibur Legends, Iím guessing, although
4167000	4168000	who knows.
4168000	4169000	Maybe theyíre doing that again.
4169000	4170120	We could use the next-gen Soul Calibur game.
4170120	4171120	That would be pretty awesome.
4171120	4176560	A new Soul Calibur game possibly being announced, so that would be kind of neat.
4176560	4180960	Another rumor thatís going on, apparently a website RPG Gamer had an interview with
4180960	4189760	NS America, and one of the questions was, according to the Q&A, one of the answers to
4189760	4194240	a question, ìIs Disgaea coming into any other platforms?î They mentioned the DS.
4194240	4197840	So you might get Disgaea on the DS soon.
4197840	4200600	Letís see here.
4200600	4206760	So thereís an interesting thing going on.
4206760	4212960	Apparently a certain lawyer type, by the name of Jack, was supposed to beó
4212960	4213960	Voldemort?
4213960	4214960	You mean Lord Voldemort?
4214960	4222200	Yeah, Voldemort, was apparently going to be debating or participate in a debate during
4222200	4223200	PAX this year.
4223200	4227160	Of course, itís supposed to be kept under wraps, and no word if heís going to back
4227160	4228880	out of that one.
4228880	4234360	I had heard he already did, because he put out some retort toóhe thought it was infringing
4234360	4238680	on his free speech that they werenít going to advertise his appearance, blah, blah, blah.
4238680	4241880	Who cares what that asshole has to say?
4241880	4249520	Another interesting thing is console modder Ben Heck is going to be working on a portable
4249520	4254880	game system thatís going to be focused around retro games called the Game Port.
4254880	4262560	Itís supposed to be having a five hour battery life, a 480x234 pixel screen, and video out
4262560	4267680	for playing on your television, as well as SD card for game storage and etc.
4267680	4272960	So kind of nifty to see him actually making a console instead of modding them.
4272960	4277340	Speaking about homebrew stuff, there was a game I talked about on the show a while back
4277340	4278840	called No Gravity.
4278840	4281440	Itís kind of like a Descent Free Space type game.
4281440	4283800	I think I showed it to you, Rob, one time.
4283800	4287740	The best fucking homebrew game ever on the PSP, and theyíre actually going to have it
4287740	4290160	finished in June.
4290160	4293720	Full version will be coming out for free!
4293720	4299640	And itís really sad, because the game can wipe most of those other PSP games out there.
4299640	4302920	And itís developed independently and for free.
4302920	4307800	So check out No Gravity later on this month.
4307800	4309860	And letís see here.
4309860	4314920	Another thing thatís kind of interesting, also a trademark, apparently Capcom made a
4314920	4317640	trademark for Apollo Justice.
4317640	4320280	Thereís two rumors regarding this.
4320280	4324800	Some people think itís going to be a new Rival Schools game, because apparently I guess
4324800	4328000	the school is named Apollo or something like that.
4328000	4329480	No, itís Justice.
4329480	4330480	Justice.
4330480	4339560	Anyways, the other theory is that itís a subtitle for the next Phoenix Wright game.
4339560	4341800	Well, it could be either or, huh?
4341800	4342800	Yeah, interesting.
4342800	4344680	I want more Rival Schools, please.
4344680	4345680	Alright.
4345680	4351120	I have a real quick last minute story as well, and Loki, youíll like this one, I think.
4351120	4355640	1UP recently had an interview with the creator of the Mega Man franchise, and they were asking
4355640	4359280	about sequels and bringing Mega Man to the next-gen platforms.
4359280	4363720	And he basically said, ìWell, donít know if we would be able to recoup the cost of
4363720	4367400	making a game on the next-gen platforms.î But they said, ìCome on, just imagine money
4367400	4368400	wasnít an issue.
4368400	4369400	What would you do?î
4369400	4375640	And he said, ìI think it would probably be Mega Man Legends 3, and thatís not just me.
4375640	4378680	A lot of the original team members would also love to make a sequel.
4378680	4379680	They talk about it.
4379680	4380680	I talk about it sometimes.
4380680	4382880	I know they love that series, and so do I.
4382880	4387040	If I were to say right now I have a tiny, tiny, tiny dream that I wish I could realize,
4387040	4390920	but I donít know if itís possible, it would be to do a sequel in the Legends series.î
4390920	4394280	Hell yeah, thatís a series that they need to take even further, because these other
4394280	4395280	series kind of suck.
4395280	4399360	No, thatís a series they need to shoot in the head, put it down like an old horse.
4399360	4400360	Put it down.
4400360	4402760	Give me more Mega Man X, please.
4402760	4404760	I love the Legends series.
4404760	4407840	Sorry, Iím a 2D gamer.
4407840	4410720	I would like to see some type of next-gen Mega Man.
4410720	4412440	I think itís okay to do a 2D Mega Man.
4412440	4414480	Continue Legends series on the Wii.
4414480	4415480	Itís perfect.
4415480	4418280	I mean, it was an original PlayStation game.
4418280	4420680	You can definitely push those kind of graphics on that system.
4420680	4422560	Itís not Mega Man.
4422560	4423560	Who cares?
4423560	4424560	I do.
4424560	4425560	I love Mega Man.
4425560	4430960	For me, just to have it go 3D in the first place was like ripping out my heart and dancing
4430960	4432280	the lombata on it.
4432280	4435280	No, you like the Mega Man X series and the original Mega Man series.
4435280	4436640	This is a different series.
4436640	4441440	Just like the Marvel series, how they have like the Marvel 2017 series and the Marvel
4441440	4446040	Universe series and all this other stuff, well, it doesnít matter.
4446040	4448320	Just donít have to like this series.
4448320	4450600	I like this series, so they should make another one.
4450600	4455040	All I could say is please anything but those tactical games on the DS.
4455040	4456040	Oh, man.
4456040	4457040	Oh, my God.
4457040	4458040	I think we can all agree on that.
4458040	4459040	That series put it to bed.
4459040	4462240	Well, going on the same thing, though, that Loki is saying, thatís actually based off
4462240	4468280	of a completely different series, the Mega Man EXE is what those were.
4468280	4470200	Yeah, or the Battle Network, thatís what it was called.
4470200	4471560	Well, it was Rockman EXE.
4471560	4472560	Put it to bed.
4472560	4474680	It was actually based off of an anime.
4474680	4476680	Put a bullet in its head and be done.
4476680	4478200	Itís not the same type of thing.
4478200	4480240	This is supposed to be Mega Man.
4480240	4484960	This is actually something 100% completely different, just borrowing the name.
4484960	4489120	It makes sense why itís a different type of game.
4489120	4493240	And James Patrick says in chat, Mega Man, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero,
4493240	4494240	Mega Man Battle Network.
4494240	4495240	Mega Man, stop this.
4495240	4496240	Stop it.
4496240	4501720	As long as they donít do a next-gen series that looks like the cover of Mega Man 2 or
4501720	4502720	something like that.
4502720	4503720	Okay.
4503720	4510280	The US Capcom art in those days, I mean, did you see the cover for Bionic Commando?
4510280	4512280	They were pretty awful.
4512280	4517280	The only cool game that had any, you know, American redone art that was any good was
4517280	4523480	like Metal Gear, because the dude looked like, you know, hardcore awesome.
4523480	4526880	Oh no, the truck half started to move.
4526880	4529000	The least in Bionic Commando, you can kill Hitler.
4529000	4533440	Yeah, and you know what, some of the, I always think of the box art even back from the Atari
4533440	4537960	2600 days, where they had these elaborate artwork on the box, which of course the game
4537960	4541000	looked nothing like, because it was just a bunch of blocks on the screen.
4541000	4543120	It was just, I donít know.
4543120	4544120	Box artís funny.
4544120	4547760	Anyhow, thatís going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it
4547760	4548760	or not.
4548760	4551240	Letís go around and get everybodyís final thought.
4551240	4552800	Dark Soccer, why donít you start us off tonight.
4552800	4553800	Your final thought.
4553800	4559200	Um, okay, I thought it.
4559200	4561400	My final thought is ice cream.
4561400	4563360	Loki, your final thought.
4563360	4566120	My final thought is this screen for the Wii thing.
4566120	4567120	It looks kind of neat.
4567120	4568120	Itís like a portable screen.
4568120	4571120	I donít know though, I still wouldnít buy it.
