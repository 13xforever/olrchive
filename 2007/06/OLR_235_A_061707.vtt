Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roko

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, June 17th, 2007, SoulCalibur preps its fourth game for the Playstation 3 and 360

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Sony builds itself a blog, and has Project Hammer gotten some nails in its coffin?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Ripping it off and beating you with it, maybe?

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
It happened in Shaun of the Dead, except they ripped off his legs and then went after zombies with him.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
That was the best scene in the movie.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Who hasn't seen Shaun of the Dead yet?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Go see hot fuzz, everybody, by the way.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Here goes the chatroom going, me, me, me.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Hello.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Have you seen Shaun of the Dead, Loki?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Um, twice.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
It's good times. I have to admit when DarkSakura, you know, because she does movie nights once in a while at her place,

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
and I admit when she first was like, let's watch Shaun of the Dead, I was like, oh god, alright, fine, we'll watch a movie.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
It's only two hours. It was actually really good.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
I don't know if you were there a couple years ago, but we did Shaun of the Dead and then we watched the new Dawn of the Dead.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Actually, I think it was in the reverse. We watched the new Dawn of the Dead and then Shaun of the Dead.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
I wasn't there because I never saw the new Dawn of the Dead.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
The new Dawn of the Dead sucked. Shaun of the Dead was awesome, though, and hot fuzz is better.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
I still haven't seen hot fuzz.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Hot fuzz is great. I've seen it twice now.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I've seen it twice.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, give me one of yours.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I went to see it with Ranma.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
I seriously can't remember the last.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
That's right.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
When we left, you guys went to movie transformers early.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Do you?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Before it comes out.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Lucky you. How do you explain that?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Through work stuff?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yeah, through work.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, very nice.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
A few days.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
I can't wait.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Are we a movie podcast?

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Hey, they're making a game based on it, and it's going to be fucking awesome.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And they should make a game out of Shaun of the Dead, shouldn't they?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
They should.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Absolutely.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Hot fuzz would be funny, too.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
A romantic comedy was Zombies of the Game.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
One of these days, I seriously think the last movie I saw in the theater was Notes on a Scandal, which they should not make into a video game.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I don't think that would be a very interesting video game.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Scandal.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
You can control Judi Dench as she creates lesbian scandal.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
It would be wonderful.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
All right, anyhow.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
You take notes on it.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
You write with your wiimote.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
You just write your notes.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Scandal, scandal, scandal, scandal.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
All right, anyhow.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
Happy Father's Day, also, to any dads that are listening to our program, as it is Father's Day today.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
I know we have some daddy gamers, so congrats to all of you folks.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I hope you're having a great day.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
So, just wanted to get that out there.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Let's get into the show and talk about our gaming weeks.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Start off, Dark Sakura.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
How was your gaming week?

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Well, I've been spending the whole week looking for my copy of Elite Beat Agents, because Dan wants to play it,

03:21.000 --> 03:32.000
and playing some World of Warcraft, like hardly any, because I still want Burning Crusade so I can play a hot little elf.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Very cool.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
You still haven't gotten Burning Crusade?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
What money do I have, Rob?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I don't know.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
You certainly don't get paid for this, so I don't know.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Yeah, I don't have much money, so no.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, sorry to hear it.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Unless someone in the chat room wants to buy it for me.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Sell a pinball machine.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
They're not mine.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Oh, okay.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
They're the spouses.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I see.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
All right.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Full of stuff.

03:58.000 --> 04:09.000
Actually, I played, I tried to catch up on demos on Xbox Live, so I tried Overlord, and that was pretty fun.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I guess people keep comparing it to Fable, although I've never played Fable.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Surprising.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
I'm going to play Fable 2, though, but haven't played the original Fable, so I guess it's similar to that, but it's kind of fun.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You get to control little gremlin things.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
I just want to verify, because I haven't been reading up too much on Fable 2, you will still able to be a bisexual evil warlord, correct?

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Yes, and you can get pregnant.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
If I'm a male, that might be difficult.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Yeah, that might be difficult.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
All right.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah, but...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
So...

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
That would be a real Fable right there.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
There once was a pregnant man.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
They definitely do not, like, I don't know, they blatantly ripped off gremlins.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
I mean, these creatures are so gremlin-like, they are gremlins.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Do they sing?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Yes, they do, and actually...

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
That's great.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
And they can attack sheep, and that's what you have them do a lot, is attack things, and that's kind of cool.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
And it's sort of like Fable, where you can be good and evil, except you have the choice of being evil or eviler.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
I want to be uber evil.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So it's actually pretty cool.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
The other game I played was Monster Madness, and now this game I was kind of looking forward to check out,

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
because it reminded me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and who doesn't like Zombies Ate My Neighbors?

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
This game is no Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and it's awful.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
The controls in it, awful, and it's way too damn hard, so I don't recommend it at all.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
The other games I played, Mad Tracks, I actually tried that out a little bit, and that was pretty fun.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
I played through a few levels of that, although there really isn't too much to the game.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
You can probably beat it pretty quick, so they're kind of trying to sell those additional add-ons for it.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
I don't know, not my thing.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Didn't play Pac-Man Championship Edition.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
I looked at it, downloaded the demo, so I haven't played it yet.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
But it's Pac-Man.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh, I'm sorry, it's a sequel to Pac-Man.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I have more to say on this, but I'll wait my turn.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, Dan downloaded that.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I was like, okay, what the hell?

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
He was like, I came home, and all I was doing was freaking screaming at the ghosts.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Doesn't he do that all the time?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
He was really screaming at me.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
He was calling them bastards.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
I was like, dude, you sound like me talking to my computer.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
And then, I downloaded the Project Silphie demo today, but I forgot to play that.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I finished Super Paper Mario.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Congrats.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, the end is like, you saw it coming throughout the entire game, and it's just like, once

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
you finish it, you're rewarded with, hey, guess what?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Don't you fucking spoil it.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
No, I'm not going to spoil it.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I'm just saying, once you finish the game, you're rewarded with, hey, you get to go back

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
to this one level and fight a hundred people, and it'll take another couple hours.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Fuck you.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
I mean, it's awful.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
That's what the whole game is, is full of this like, fight a hundred people, do that

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
for two hours.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
So, are you saying at the end of the game, you get told, we're sorry, Mario, but our

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
princess is in another castle?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
No, it's more like...

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
We're sorry, Mario, but your game sucks.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
It's more like, thank you for playing through the game, no replay value whatsoever, sell

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
it back to GameStop.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Thank you very much.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
So, that's pretty much what I'm going to have to do.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
I did download Zelda 2.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I don't know why, but I've actually been playing this game.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
You can lend it to me before you sell it back.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
You can borrow my copy.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I'm not playing it.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
If you really want to play it, I'll lend you mine.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
It's a great game.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
It's just, you know, after you've played through all of it, it's just kind of, eh.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
There's a bunch of side quests you can do that have no reward whatsoever.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
What?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Zelda 2?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
No, not Zelda 2.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
I'm talking about Super Mario.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
No, Zelda 2 is awesome.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
I was like, Zelda 2 is fucking rad.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
I don't know why people diss it.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.600
It's like one of the worst in the series.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.600
It's great.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.600
It's really fucking weird.

07:40.600 --> 07:43.200
Go play Wand of Gamelon if you want to see the worst ones in the series, okay?

07:43.200 --> 07:45.120
It doesn't feel like Zelda at all.

07:45.120 --> 07:49.760
It's just very strange, and I remember playing through it and it being very hard.

07:49.760 --> 07:54.160
It still is kind of hard, but I don't know, I can understand it more.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.440
Why did the name of everything really strange names is beyond me?

07:57.440 --> 07:58.440
I am Error.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.440
Yeah, I remember that.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.440
I went in and I'm like, oh, there's that.

08:01.440 --> 08:08.000
I think that was actually supposed to have been something else, and it programmed in

08:08.000 --> 08:09.520
wrong, if I remember right.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.520
Really?

08:10.520 --> 08:11.520
With the translation.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
Huh.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.520
I want that on a shirt.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.520
I am Error.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.120
There's got to be a shirt somewhere.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.120
I'm sure there is.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.520
You can just have one made, you know.

08:18.520 --> 08:19.840
Maybe his name is just Error.

08:19.840 --> 08:20.840
I mean...

08:20.840 --> 08:22.720
I'm going to name my firstborn Error.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.440
I mean, fucking look at that.

08:24.440 --> 08:29.800
That would be a horrible thing for parents to do to name their baby Error.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.000
With the middle name Oops.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.880
Error Oops Summers.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.280
Love it.

08:37.280 --> 08:41.800
Then finally, the last game I've been playing, and this is weird because I've actually played

08:41.800 --> 08:46.320
this game more than I played Guitar Hero, but it uses the Guitar Hero controller for

08:46.320 --> 08:50.320
the 360, and it's a game for the PC called Fret Nice.

08:50.320 --> 08:56.320
The best way to describe it is it's like playing Loco Roco with a guitar, and it actually works

08:56.320 --> 08:57.320
pretty well.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.200
They've got some really interesting level designs and stuff.

09:00.200 --> 09:05.480
The only bad thing about it is it's only three levels long, but it's a lot of fun, so I recommend

09:05.480 --> 09:06.480
downloading that.

09:06.480 --> 09:12.640
I may post a link to it in my blog on all games so that you can actually find it, because

09:12.640 --> 09:19.560
it's on some foreign website or something, but it's cool, and it's free, so I highly

09:19.560 --> 09:22.080
recommend doing that.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.080
I don't know.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.540
I don't play the Guitar Hero.

09:25.540 --> 09:26.540
It's weird.

09:26.540 --> 09:34.600
We did this thing on Friday last week that it was basically the sales team building thing,

09:34.600 --> 09:41.280
and we had to perform songs on stage, and they have video of it, but anyways, they had

09:41.280 --> 09:45.080
like one person had the Air Guitar, so I had to do the Air Guitar part of it because I

09:45.080 --> 09:46.520
didn't want to sing.

09:46.520 --> 09:51.320
You know how my issues are with singing, so I did that, and everyone was like, oh, you're

09:51.320 --> 09:52.320
so good at that.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.560
Maybe it's because you play Guitar Hero all the time.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.120
I'm like, I don't play Guitar Hero.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.120
I bought the game.

09:57.120 --> 09:58.760
I don't play it.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.440
Everyone just has this weird, I don't know.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.960
Because I own the game, they figure that I play it a lot or something, or because I'm

10:05.960 --> 10:11.200
a gamer, oh, I must have played Guitar Hero a lot, or because you were on the internet

10:11.200 --> 10:13.120
radio program about music video games.

10:13.120 --> 10:18.600
Therefore you can pass every catastrophic in DDR in the group.

10:18.600 --> 10:23.240
Back in the day, I wasn't so fat.

10:23.240 --> 10:27.640
That's what it boils down to, because I played more DDR.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
Exactly.

10:28.640 --> 10:34.800
Then you get married, and you don't have DDR time, and it all goes downhill from there.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.240
Anything else about your gaming week you want to share?

10:37.240 --> 10:41.640
Oh yeah, I played more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.640
Congratulations.

10:42.640 --> 10:47.600
I got my last copy of Saints Row, and so we're going to be landing those five systems together

10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
very soon.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
Very cool.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.960
Just in time for the sequel, maybe?

10:51.960 --> 10:56.520
Saints Row 2, that's not coming down for a while, but hopefully in time for Grand Theft

10:56.520 --> 10:57.520
Auto 4.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.960
Actually, we know it's going to be in time for Grand Theft Auto 4, that's why we're building

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
it.

11:01.960 --> 11:02.960
All right.

11:02.960 --> 11:03.960
Let's see, my gaming week.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.240
I also played Pac-Man Championship Edition.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.160
I was gone, obviously, for two weeks.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.160
I went to New York City, and actually I want to start off by giving a big shout out to

11:12.160 --> 11:15.760
those folks that actually came and met up with me on Sunday.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.800
About the time we would have usually done Orange on the Radio, I was hanging out with

11:18.800 --> 11:21.800
some of our listeners in New York City, and that was a great time.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.800
We actually went to Dave & Buster's in Times Square, and just kind of messed around there

11:24.800 --> 11:30.080
a little for a little while, and played this game called Jumpin' Jackpot, which is hilarious.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.520
They have one of these at Roseville Golf Land, actually it's the virtual jump rope with the

11:33.520 --> 11:40.140
lights going around, and it plays this really super gay rave music while you're jumping.

11:40.140 --> 11:42.100
But it's hard, and it's crack.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.000
You keep putting money in over and over.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.720
And we played some DDR, they had Superdome, we were playing a bunch of stuff, and it was

11:47.720 --> 11:48.720
a good time.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.120
What are you laughing at?

11:50.120 --> 11:52.120
Did somebody link that in chat room?

11:52.120 --> 11:54.640
Chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join the chat room.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.640
What is this?

11:55.640 --> 11:56.640
This is VG Cats?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.280
No, Digital Unrest is what this is.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.800
Sounds kind of like VG Cats, though.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
Link that in chat.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.800
Someone already did.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.440
Oh, okay.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.440
Very nice.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.980
Oh, because they actually had a baby.

12:06.980 --> 12:07.980
Very nice.

12:07.980 --> 12:08.980
Yeah.

12:08.980 --> 12:09.980
All right.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.400
For those of you guys listening to us on the podcast, there's just more incentive to

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
listen live.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.920
Digital Unrest comic.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.320
Just search for the Error comic.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.320
It's great.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.960
Anyhow, damn it, you interrupted my story, woman.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.320
Yes!

12:21.320 --> 12:22.320
Dave and Busters.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.320
You know, I have enough tickets to buy an Xbox 360 game, but I'm just not interested

12:25.320 --> 12:26.680
in anything that they have there.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.960
Anyhow, so big thanks to all the listeners who showed up.

12:30.960 --> 12:35.560
Also went, Ranma took me to this video game shop, or I think he was the one that led the

12:35.560 --> 12:36.560
way.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
I mean, all of us kind of went there.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.160
All of us that were still together at this time.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.880
We went to this video game shop near Astor Place, where the big cube is, and they had

12:43.880 --> 12:44.880
like tons of stuff.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.280
Like I sent you the picture of the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and all these import stuff, but

12:48.280 --> 12:53.560
they were selling old school NES games, and my friend has an old school Nintendo.

12:53.560 --> 12:57.640
The date Wednesday we set aside just to recuperate from Jetlag, I actually played through an

12:57.640 --> 13:00.160
original Metroid cartridge all the way from start to finish.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
It was so awesome.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.160
I love Metroid.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.760
I forgot how much I missed that game, but I actually bought her a copy of the Guardian

13:05.760 --> 13:07.520
Legend from this store that we found.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.520
Yeah, I got to push your propaganda on everybody.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.760
$15 to buy that game.

13:12.760 --> 13:13.760
They still don't.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.760
That's not bad.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.760
Yeah, I know.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.040
They're charging a lot for the old NES games now.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.240
It's like they've gone up in value.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.240
So it's very interesting.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.240
Was it in the box?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.240
No.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.480
It was just the cart and the black slate.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.400
When I bought mine, I paid $10, and I got it in the box.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.240
But I got her an original cartridge of Guardian Legends.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.240
That made me happy.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.720
Completely unopened.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.720
That's nice.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.720
Yeah, my Guardian Legend.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.040
I opened it to play it, of course.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.560
There you go.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.040
So yeah, I got her a copy of Guardian Legend.

13:39.040 --> 13:42.880
I should have just took it home with me, but I don't have an old school Nintendo here.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.160
I'm holding out hope they will put it on Virtual Console eventually.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
Rob!

13:46.160 --> 13:47.160
What?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.160
Who do you know in this room who has five Nintendos?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.160
Are you going to give me one?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.160
Probably.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
I could.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.160
Sweet!

13:53.160 --> 13:54.160
Let me talk to Dan.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.240
Then maybe I'm going to send Amanda back to that store and give me more games.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.120
Just buy a Generation Next.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.040
Oh yeah, we'll talk about that later in the show.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.600
There's this other thing coming out I'll talk about later.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
Well, no.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
It's already out.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
Well, isn't it on the show roll?

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
No.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
It's not something else.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.880
This is the thing we saw at E3 a few years back.

14:07.880 --> 14:08.880
Oh, that thing!

14:08.880 --> 14:10.880
The $20 console thing.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.880
Sixty.

14:11.880 --> 14:12.880
Sixty?

14:12.880 --> 14:13.880
Sixty bucks.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
I thought they were only charging people $20.

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
Was that just at the show?

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
That was at the show.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
No, I see.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.880
You should have bought it at the show.

14:18.880 --> 14:19.880
What the hell?

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
Oh well.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.760
Anyhow, so yeah, obviously there was some 8-bit gaming goodness.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.760
Dave and Busters.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.720
I finally caved and I got a DS Lite, which, by the way, I saw this story floating around

14:28.720 --> 14:33.440
blogs this week talking about how Nintendo World has these custom DS Lites that you can

14:33.440 --> 14:35.200
buy in all these different colors.

14:35.200 --> 14:40.480
They wanted $280 for those, and the picture that's floating around doesn't show you all

14:40.480 --> 14:41.480
the colors that they have.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.080
I don't know if they added some or what because I distinctly remember there was a green one

14:45.080 --> 14:47.600
because that's the one I wanted to get, and you don't see that one in the pictures that

14:47.600 --> 14:49.560
made it around all the different game blogs.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.960
Check DJ Rama's picture site, which I'm sure he'll link in chat right now.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.480
I think it's djramas.net, and check out his New York City pictures.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.360
He actually took a picture of the case with all the colors and some of the newer ones

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
that were in there.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.280
It was between that and the fuchsia hot pink one.

15:02.280 --> 15:06.000
I don't remember what the fucking website is, but there is a website out there that

15:06.000 --> 15:11.160
you can buy, custom colored anything, consoles, portable systems.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.120
Two hundred and eighty bucks they wanted for that.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.760
Well, you can buy it cheaper than that.

15:14.760 --> 15:22.600
They sell iPods there, they sell PSPs, DS Lites, everything, and you can get them in

15:22.600 --> 15:23.600
custom colors.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.200
I'm not sure about DS Lites, but I know they sold the original DS on the site.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.640
People just forget that you can do that or just paint it.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.640
I don't know.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.960
You can just get a part and paint the damn thing.

15:34.960 --> 15:39.040
They also do engraving there, and I almost bought my new DS Lite at the Nintendo World

15:39.040 --> 15:43.000
Store to get it engraved, because they'll engrave your DS for only twenty bucks, and

15:43.000 --> 15:45.760
there's all these patterns you can choose from, and I thought that was pretty awesome,

15:45.760 --> 15:49.720
but their engraving machine was broken, so I didn't get to do it.

15:49.720 --> 15:50.720
Sucks to that.

15:50.720 --> 15:55.800
Their engraving machine said I am error.

15:55.800 --> 16:00.240
When I got to Pennsylvania, I was like, well, sales tax is lower here than it is in California.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.160
I was so bored in Pennsylvania, I have to be honest.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.480
No offense to those of you folks that live in the Allentown area where I was at for a

16:06.480 --> 16:09.600
few days, but Lehigh Valley, all that stuff, I was really bored.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.600
So I bought a DS Lite, and I bought Puzzle Quest.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.520
Oh my God, that game is amazing.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.240
It is so addicting.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.720
It's simple, it's just bejeweled, but the whole fact that they threw this competitive

16:20.720 --> 16:24.400
element into it, where you're taking turns, you really have to think about the game a

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
whole new way.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.040
You can't just go, oh, I'm going to line this up, I'm going to line this up, I'm going to

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
make a chain, make a chain.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.520
Because you have to line things up, and you don't want your opponent, who's going to go

16:33.520 --> 16:36.000
after you, to be able to line up the skulls.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
Because basically, to explain the game real fast, there's a story that all goes with it.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.800
You can cast spells, which are like special moves on the board, but to do that requires

16:44.800 --> 16:45.800
mana.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.640
And so the stones on the board are red, yellow, blue, and green.

16:48.640 --> 16:53.400
And then you also have gold coins, purple experience stars, and skulls.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.800
When you line up the coins, you get gold.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.660
When you line up the experience stars, you get experience, so you can level up.

16:57.660 --> 17:00.840
When you line up the skulls, your opponent takes damage.

17:00.840 --> 17:05.000
So it sounds kind of complicated, but if you play Bejeweled, you can pick this game up.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.940
And just the fact that they kind of threw that whole twist into it really was innovative.

17:10.940 --> 17:12.000
It made the game a lot of fun.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.960
So I totally love Puzzle Quest, and I hope they come out with it on Xbox Live Arcade.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.360
I hope those rumors are true.

17:19.360 --> 17:23.640
Also I picked up Planet Puzzle League, but I haven't played enough of that just yet to

17:23.640 --> 17:25.840
really play, to give it a fair response.

17:25.840 --> 17:31.600
But I played it once, and I know it's very similar, of course, to Pokemon Puzzle League,

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
but with some new stuff.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.440
You totally reminded me of the other game I was playing.

17:34.440 --> 17:35.440
What's that?

17:35.440 --> 17:36.440
Pokemans!

17:36.440 --> 17:37.440
Oh, Pearl and Diamond?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.440
Or what do you have, Diamond?

17:38.440 --> 17:39.440
I have Pearl.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.440
Oh, Pearl?

17:40.440 --> 17:41.440
Because I'm being not like everybody else.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.440
I have Pearl, too.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
Bah!

17:43.440 --> 17:44.440
You're being like me.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.440
Bah!

17:45.440 --> 17:46.440
Yourself.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.440
No, I'm being different.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.440
All right, that's fine.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.440
Are you having fun with your Pokemans?

17:49.440 --> 17:50.440
At the gym, yes.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.440
Right, cool.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.440
I've learned the fine art of playing Pokemans on the elliptical.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.080
That's a good idea.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.080
It's very hard.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.080
I've been playing Pokemans a lot of times.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.880
Let's see, then also I played Pac-Man Championship Edition, which I thought was great, but the

18:00.880 --> 18:06.400
only thing that made me mad about it is that the original Pac-Man that came out a few months

18:06.400 --> 18:11.280
ago for five bucks, totally worthless now, unless you really want the authentic arcade

18:11.280 --> 18:12.280
experience.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.720
Pac-Man CE is really, like, really, ultimately, the two of them should have been released

18:15.720 --> 18:18.960
together for ten bucks, and that would have been the most fair deal, I think.

18:18.960 --> 18:23.680
If you want the authentic Pac-Man arcade experience, go buy Pac-Man arcade machine.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.000
They're probably cheap now.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Not really.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Really?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Are they, like, hot collector's items?

18:28.000 --> 18:31.240
You can find them at, um, well, in the Sacramento, Roseville area.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.240
You can find them at DiDio's.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.800
There's a guy that sells arcade machines.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.460
But hundreds or thousands of dollars for an arcade machine, or five bucks on Xbox Live

18:39.460 --> 18:41.260
for pretty much the next best thing.

18:41.260 --> 18:42.260
I don't know.

18:42.260 --> 18:43.260
Hard to tell.

18:43.260 --> 18:45.200
I want to see Xbox Live arcades in an arcade.

18:45.200 --> 18:50.840
Well, anyway, Pac-Man, I liked Pac-Man Ship, or Pac-Man Championship Edition a lot.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.640
I think the game is set up great.

18:52.640 --> 18:57.240
Really, it's weird, because you eat the dots, and when all the dots are gone on one half

18:57.240 --> 19:01.080
of the screen, a fruit shows up on the other side of the screen, and when you eat the fruit,

19:01.080 --> 19:02.080
more dots appear.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.940
So you're kind of, like, ping-ponging to both sides of the screen.

19:04.940 --> 19:08.200
It's really trippy, and it's got a pretty interesting rave-y soundtrack.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.400
What is up with Namco and the rave-y soundtrack games?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.080
Namco made that flaming finger game at Dave & Buster's.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.560
They made the jump and jackpot game.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.920
Namco is, like, there's rave whores that work, like, they're all on ecstasy over there or

19:19.920 --> 19:20.920
something.

19:20.920 --> 19:21.920
So, whatever.

19:21.920 --> 19:27.040
Now, Pac-Man Championship Edition, and also I played Prince of Persia Classic.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.040
The game looks beautiful.

19:28.040 --> 19:33.360
I mean, the way they redid the graphics, that's the best rehash of the graphics of any game

19:33.360 --> 19:38.440
on Xbox Live Arcade, but I didn't end up buying the whole game, because I've played Prince

19:38.440 --> 19:42.240
of Persia Classic just so many times, I really wasn't interested in playing through it again.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.960
The game can get so frustrating at some points, but it's definitely worth checking out the

19:45.960 --> 19:51.520
demo, and if you've never played the Classic game before, it's probably worth a look for

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
a chance.

19:52.520 --> 19:55.080
If I remember Prince of Persia, I remember it was fucking hard, and I got frustrated

19:55.080 --> 19:57.800
with it really quickly.

19:57.800 --> 20:03.000
Checking out the chat room, www.orangelandsradio.com, click on chat, or you can go directly to chat.orangelandsradio.com,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.920
we tape live on Sunday nights.

20:04.920 --> 20:11.040
Let's see, BlackDevilerX agrees with Loki's, I want to see Xbox Live Arcade in an arcade.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.020
I think it'd be cool, they should.

20:13.020 --> 20:18.100
TheRobD says, I hate flaming finger, and Jvmon says, flaming finger told Skye to get his

20:18.100 --> 20:19.100
flame on.

20:19.100 --> 20:21.120
That's right, you know the game said, when you start the game, have you played flaming

20:21.120 --> 20:22.320
finger, Dave & Buster's?

20:22.320 --> 20:23.960
I watched you play it.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.520
I didn't even shake you.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.680
You're playing footsie with my hand.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.640
Whenever you put your money in the game, whatever it says, get your flame on, which is really

20:32.640 --> 20:36.840
funny, because I'm gay, and you know, they say flaming or whatever.

20:36.840 --> 20:43.920
Anyway, let's see, looking at what else is going on in chat room, Gerardimo says, Pokemon

20:43.920 --> 20:48.960
Puzzle League sucked because it had no Yoshi, making a reference to the old school Tetris

20:48.960 --> 20:49.960
Attack.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.960
GS68 points out there's a Ms. Pac-Man machine at Miggle, Milpitas Golf Land, a very infamous

20:53.960 --> 20:56.080
arcade here in California.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.000
BlackBoy says, I think I need the Fuchsia DS Lite.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.960
So, that's almost a flaming DS Lite right there.

21:02.960 --> 21:07.840
Alright, well, that sounds like it's about it for our gaming weeks, so let's get into

21:07.840 --> 21:14.920
some housekeeping real, real quick, and then we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.280
Not a whole lot of housekeeping.

21:16.280 --> 21:21.040
Next week is our fifth anniversary show, and I know, crazy, huh?

21:21.040 --> 21:26.020
We're going to keep exactly what we're doing somewhat under wraps until the show comes

21:26.020 --> 21:30.400
next week, basically because we still haven't figured it out completely, but all we can

21:30.400 --> 21:33.880
say is that it'll definitely be very us, no matter what we end up doing.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.960
It's definitely going to be very us.

21:35.960 --> 21:43.680
Alright, also, we wanted to say a happy 100th episode to Bobby, because he had his 100th

21:43.680 --> 21:47.240
episode tonight, so congrats to Bobby Blackwolf, our friend over at AllGames.com.

21:47.240 --> 21:51.880
Speaking of AllGames.com, you can always hear the rebroadcast of our program over there.

21:51.880 --> 21:57.720
Monday nights at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time, they replay our show.

21:57.720 --> 22:02.280
It's A and B back to back, so sometimes you have to wait for part B on the podcast or

22:02.280 --> 22:04.020
audio blog feed for a little while.

22:04.020 --> 22:07.240
They replay it over there Monday nights and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific Standard

22:07.240 --> 22:08.380
Time.

22:08.380 --> 22:10.080
Let's get into some gaming news.

22:10.080 --> 22:14.680
We obviously missed a week last week, so, Loki, tell us about what we missed.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.280
Uh, well, some stuff.

22:17.280 --> 22:22.760
I guess the Halo 3 beta ended, so everybody's sad because they have to wait for the Halo

22:22.760 --> 22:27.000
3 actual game to come out, but, you know, hey, whatever.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
They got a good turnout.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.960
Apparently, Bungie was saying that they've clocked so many hours of Halo 3 that they

22:31.960 --> 22:35.680
could have, if they were to create, I guess, one-on-one games using the same amount of

22:35.680 --> 22:41.720
time in that beta, they would have 700 years worth of gameplay, so...

22:41.720 --> 22:43.120
Go analysts!

22:43.120 --> 22:47.160
Anyways, other rumors, I played it twice.

22:47.160 --> 22:50.640
I played it once, I beat you.

22:50.640 --> 22:58.520
So Parappa 3 rumored to be coming to the PS3, and this, of course, is coming from EGM.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.760
No other information on that other than it's rumored.

23:00.760 --> 23:04.240
I think that's kind of saying, like, duh.

23:04.240 --> 23:09.720
Prince of Persia, the movie, it's going to be coming out July 10th, 2009.

23:09.720 --> 23:13.820
Everybody's excited because it's going to be very Pirates of the Caribbean-like, so

23:13.820 --> 23:17.520
hurrah.

23:17.520 --> 23:23.620
Another updated, or upgraded graphic version of Metal Gear Solid 4's Tokyo Game Show

23:23.620 --> 23:30.840
trailer has made it online with a little interesting bit that's missing towards the end.

23:30.840 --> 23:36.360
Some people will notice that the PlayStation 3 logo is missing at the very end of the trailer.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.360
Here we go again.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.360
It's coming to the 360!

23:38.360 --> 23:39.360
I swear to God, this game is coming to the 360!

23:39.360 --> 23:40.360
This game is coming to the 360!

23:40.360 --> 23:44.960
Why aren't you people listening to me?

23:44.960 --> 23:47.440
Oh my God.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.080
People are going crazy.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.740
Anyways, shut up!

23:51.740 --> 23:55.600
When they're ready to announce it on the 360, they will announce it, and yes, they probably

23:55.600 --> 23:59.320
will, but keep your pants on in the meantime, God.

23:59.320 --> 24:07.040
And next being announced, coming to film ultra-generic video game movie 4, in other words, City of

24:07.040 --> 24:14.420
Heroes is going to be adapted to film and TV, because I don't know, it's just a parody

24:14.420 --> 24:17.120
of all the other superhero things out there.

24:17.120 --> 24:21.440
Sure, generic superhero movie, that'd be awesome.

24:21.440 --> 24:25.360
Then Myst is coming to the DS, hurrah.

24:25.360 --> 24:29.400
Lego MMO coming in 2008, that's awesome.

24:29.400 --> 24:34.900
Tomb Raider anniversary edition, because you know, Tomb Raider is so fucking awesome, woohoo.

24:34.900 --> 24:39.320
It's actually coming to the 360, possibly as download content, this is coming from ratings,

24:39.320 --> 24:44.320
found on the ESRB's website, and people are thinking that's going to be download content,

24:44.320 --> 24:48.120
possibly for Tomb Raider Legends, don't care.

24:48.120 --> 24:54.680
And Pac-Man Championship Edition was released for the 360, and I guess it's the first actual

24:54.680 --> 24:59.800
sequel to Pac-Man, although I do remember there's like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Junior

24:59.800 --> 25:11.520
Pac-Man, Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, Pac-Man Jr. though was admittedly harder because it had the scrolling

25:11.520 --> 25:13.440
screen.

25:13.440 --> 25:18.120
And it just kind of sucked, generally, it wasn't a Pac-Man or Junior Pac-Man.

25:18.120 --> 25:23.240
What the fuck about Super Pac-Man, that game was completely different than Pac-Man, listen,

25:23.240 --> 25:28.680
it's new, okay, sorry, this is coming from the people that know Pac-Man, the people that

25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
made it.

25:29.680 --> 25:34.240
Look, this is the first Pac-Man with raving, I'll give it that, this is the first Ravealicious

25:34.240 --> 25:36.520
Pac-Man game, that's what it's got.

25:36.520 --> 25:41.200
Guess what, you fucking bought Pac-Man again, you suck, you stupid bastard, and guess what,

25:41.200 --> 25:47.240
Nintendo has another fucking Game Boy to throw at you too, dumbass, fuck, anyway, so yeah,

25:47.240 --> 25:53.160
it came out, hooray, 10 bucks, I didn't buy it, but no, I did, I'm taking my shit, a lot

25:53.160 --> 25:56.280
of people on my friends list did do it, a lot of people bought it.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.520
Guess what, and then when the next Namco fucking collection comes out, there will be Pac-Man

25:59.520 --> 26:04.720
in that too, and when the next console comes out, there will be another Pac-Man game, because

26:04.720 --> 26:06.440
people buy Pac-Man.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.040
You're sighing, Jamie, why are you sighing?

26:09.040 --> 26:10.960
Getting ready to shoot myself in the head.

26:10.960 --> 26:14.760
Why, from all the Pac-Man, Pac-Man overload, if you put the bullet in the right place,

26:14.760 --> 26:17.960
you might have a little triangular shaped hole there, and then you would be actually

26:17.960 --> 26:18.960
Ms. Pac-Man.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.960
Where's Jigglypuff?

26:19.960 --> 26:24.440
Uh, let's see, Banda in our chat room says, I want a Pac-Man MMORPG.

26:24.440 --> 26:25.440
No!

26:25.440 --> 26:29.400
What the hell would you do in a Pac-Man MMO?

26:29.400 --> 26:32.400
Pac-Man eating shit.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.400
Did you not play Pac-Man World?

26:33.400 --> 26:36.240
No, it'd be like, it'd be like the Pac-Man family from the cartoon.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.920
Oh yeah, and there was that side-scrolling Pac-Man game, what the fuck, isn't that a

26:39.920 --> 26:40.920
sequel?

26:40.920 --> 26:42.640
Remember, at Classic Gaming Expo, I bought that.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.640
You did?

26:43.640 --> 26:45.240
I bought it for the TurboGrafx.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.240
You sucker.

26:46.240 --> 26:50.040
But, it was the only copy that I have.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.760
Oh, okay, well that makes it all of them.

26:52.760 --> 26:53.760
Oh, well, okay.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.760
It's Pac-Land.

26:54.760 --> 26:55.760
It was Pac-Land.

26:55.760 --> 26:59.160
I remember playing Pac-Land, I'm like, oh, Pac-Land, this is gonna be interesting, because

26:59.160 --> 27:00.960
it's not Pac-Man, it's Pac-Land.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.600
I played it, I'm like, wow, this sucks.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.680
Stupid mame, making me play crappy games, because I don't know what they are, and then

27:07.680 --> 27:09.440
you went back to Ms. World 96 Nude.

27:09.440 --> 27:13.800
No, all you have to do, if ever you want the ultimate mame experience, you just play Blazing

27:13.800 --> 27:14.800
Star.

27:14.800 --> 27:19.480
All right, I have to introduce our special guest tonight, who came in a little bit late

27:19.480 --> 27:23.880
there while Loki was doing his story, but this is your first time in the studio, right?

27:23.880 --> 27:27.600
I think the last time I went here was in 2005 May.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.920
You're old school.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.640
Right after Phantom May of 2005.

27:30.640 --> 27:31.640
Let's tell them who you are.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.240
What's your name, what's your online name, where might we have seen you before?

27:35.240 --> 27:38.960
Okay, my name is Jonas Casarino, or also known as Explicit.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.960
I think some of you guys heard me a long time ago.

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
Old school.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.200
Our F.U. of the Week god.

27:45.200 --> 27:50.280
Oh god, that's right, he likes to give the F.U.s the week that go on all day.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.000
But that's all right, we'll let you get to it.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.440
What kind of stuff do you do out there in the community?

27:54.440 --> 27:58.320
Right now, SacAnime has got me part of...

27:58.320 --> 27:59.320
I'll be there.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.320
Oh, you will be there?

28:00.320 --> 28:02.880
I'll be one of the head people of the gaming area.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.280
I'll be cosplaying.

28:04.280 --> 28:06.540
Cool, as what?

28:06.540 --> 28:09.200
Sexy Nojuku Iruka.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.160
Sexy isn't it?

28:11.160 --> 28:16.400
I know where people are going to know you from, Explicit, is your cosplay from Fanime

28:16.400 --> 28:19.000
this year, which is actually when I told you.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
That was the greatest ever.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.080
Because when I ran into you, I said, you need to come back on the show.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.680
Tell them what you cosplayed as, it was awesome.

28:25.680 --> 28:33.240
Okay, for those who did not go to Fanime Con, I was the one who dressed up as the Weemote.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.560
We saw you walking by when we were heading back to the hotel room, we were like, dude,

28:37.560 --> 28:39.560
is that a Weemote?

28:39.560 --> 28:43.000
I said to someone, I was like, that's explicit, remember him when he used to come on the show?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.680
You weren't there, I was walking...

28:44.680 --> 28:47.320
I was with somebody, it might have been Ramu or somebody, I was like, that's explicit.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.320
Oh, was it you, Matt?

28:48.320 --> 28:49.320
Maybe that's it.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
Alright, that's what it was.

28:50.320 --> 28:54.720
Alright, but anyway, so now you're back, and so we were able to exchange numbers and everything,

28:54.720 --> 28:58.280
get you back here on the program to give some more FUs, so feel free to chime in throughout

28:58.280 --> 28:59.280
the night.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.280
What kind of games have you been playing recently?

29:01.280 --> 29:02.280
Any Wii games?

29:02.280 --> 29:06.480
Well, since I have a Wii, yep, WarioWare, I'd like to try to get someone to play drunk

29:06.480 --> 29:07.800
WarioWare on that.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.280
Mmm, there's an idea for the fifth anniversary.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.280
Alright.

29:11.280 --> 29:16.840
And let's, yeah, um, let's see, I've been playing Planet Puzzle League lately, since

29:16.840 --> 29:21.000
I've been trying to get, trying to master all these puzzle games lately.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.000
What do you think of it?

29:22.000 --> 29:27.840
It was actually pretty difficult just to master itself, it's a lot harder than like Tetris

29:27.840 --> 29:30.160
or Luminous in which...

29:30.160 --> 29:32.480
I bought it, but I've only played it once, so.

29:32.480 --> 29:36.040
Yeah, but I've just seen that insane video that someone sent me a while ago, it was like

29:36.040 --> 29:38.040
33X combo.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.040
Dang.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.040
Yeah.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.040
Is that on YouTube somewhere?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.040
I might have to check that out.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.040
Yeah, it's on YouTube somewhere.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.040
Huh.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.040
Have you played Puzzle Quest?

29:45.040 --> 29:46.040
Because I was raving about that earlier in the show.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.040
Puzzle Quest is great.

29:47.040 --> 29:48.040
I have not played that yet.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.420
It's like, if you like role-playing games, you like puzzle games, they made this game

29:51.420 --> 29:52.420
for you.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.720
Seriously, they put a little bow on it and said, here, here it is.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.720
Is it for DS?

29:55.720 --> 29:56.720
Just for you.

29:56.720 --> 30:00.640
For DS, PSP, and supposedly Xbox Live Arcade, I remember us doing a story that it's coming

30:00.640 --> 30:05.220
to Xbox Live Arcade, but seriously, just get the DS, or PSP, actually, I have a friend,

30:05.220 --> 30:07.520
this is the PSP version, looks a lot better.

30:07.520 --> 30:11.120
I haven't seen it myself yet, I'm content with the DS one, but, I don't know.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
We'll see what happens.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
Take your poison.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.940
Alright, anyway, so explicit, ladies and gentlemen, is here, so feel free to chime in whenever

30:16.940 --> 30:17.940
you like.

30:17.940 --> 30:21.520
But, we need to get to this week's news, so, Loki, if you wouldn't mind starting us off

30:21.520 --> 30:23.600
with a little piece of the news from this week.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.720
Yes, a piece of the news.

30:25.720 --> 30:30.600
And of course, you know, if you've been listening to All Games, you probably heard about it,

30:30.600 --> 30:36.760
but Sony has officially announced the agency for PC and the PS3.

30:36.760 --> 30:41.880
It's going to be a brand new spy-themed MMO, not exactly spy versus spy, but it's still

30:41.880 --> 30:46.160
pretty awesome, and yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.280
And I don't know, we don't know.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.660
Is it, Loki?

30:49.660 --> 30:51.880
Is it going to be cool?

30:51.880 --> 30:52.880
How do you know?

30:52.880 --> 30:53.880
How do I know?

30:53.880 --> 30:54.880
Because the screenshots look cool.

30:54.880 --> 30:58.280
I mean, you've got two people firing guns at a bunch of people with guns.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.920
I mean, that's all you need is guns and people firing guns.

31:00.920 --> 31:01.920
I mean, seriously.

31:01.920 --> 31:02.920
No, no, no, no, no.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.040
And he has a parachute.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.040
Is there fire?

31:06.040 --> 31:07.720
Yes or no?

31:07.720 --> 31:09.240
There's gunfire, muzzle flash, I mean.

31:09.240 --> 31:10.240
I don't know.

31:10.240 --> 31:13.640
That little spot on the ground looks like it might be fire.

31:13.640 --> 31:18.480
I'm sure it's got fire, but I don't know, it looks pretty cool.

31:18.480 --> 31:27.360
As long as it's not like, you know, she spies or something like that.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.360
You are so random.

31:28.360 --> 31:33.040
No, wait, doesn't this hook up with the PC, like it's like Shadowrun or something?

31:33.040 --> 31:34.040
I thought I heard something about that.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.040
I think it's the hook up.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.400
No, seriously, can't you play with the PC people?

31:37.400 --> 31:40.480
Well, it's an MMO, so I would imagine so.

31:40.480 --> 31:45.000
Is it across the two platforms, or is it that they're just separate entities?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.200
I got the impression you could play across both platforms.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
I believe it's cross platforms.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.200
Like Shadowrun.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.200
I mean, it should.

31:50.200 --> 31:55.080
I mean, the PS3 is fucking supposed to be powerful enough to run this shit, so why couldn't

31:55.080 --> 31:57.080
they do cross platform?

31:57.080 --> 31:58.080
I would think it is.

31:58.080 --> 32:01.760
It's not like live, you know, where it's their own self-contained network.

32:01.760 --> 32:04.680
It's Sony, do whatever, yeah.

32:04.680 --> 32:09.420
Okay, I was gone and I was a bad boy and didn't stay up too much on my gaming news, so my

32:09.420 --> 32:14.920
question to you would be, based on what you've read about this, is this the ace in the hole

32:14.920 --> 32:20.820
that Sony needed to really kind of get a lot of momentum in the next-gen wars that are

32:20.820 --> 32:21.820
going on right now?

32:21.820 --> 32:26.320
Nope, because this game will probably not be out this year, that would be my guess.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.320
So it's something like, you know, here's something to wait for.

32:28.320 --> 32:34.440
It's just like Killzone 2, ooh, Killzone 2 is coming next year, so I mean, great, that's

32:34.440 --> 32:37.460
awesome that it's coming next year, but we're talking now.

32:37.460 --> 32:40.880
That's just like saying, you know, back when the 360 launched, ooh, but the PlayStation

32:40.880 --> 32:42.440
3 is coming out.

32:42.440 --> 32:48.640
Well, goodie for them, but it's not out right now, so, you know, it's just like, you know,

32:48.640 --> 32:52.960
I'm gonna, well I'm gonna bring my friends, they're gonna beat you up, so meh.

32:52.960 --> 32:57.960
Um, going to the chat room and looking at the comments there, Bandit says, I'd rather

32:57.960 --> 33:00.560
play a She-Ra video game other than that.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.800
Dude, I bet a She-Ra game would be great.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.600
Gosh, a She-Ra game would be pretty fucking badass.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.420
It's like uber-barbarian chickly.

33:07.420 --> 33:10.320
And hopefully the little wizard guy's hidden somewhere in it.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.280
GS68 says, PlayStation 3, gimmicks, gimmicks, gimmicks.

33:13.280 --> 33:16.680
And that was Madam Raz.

33:16.680 --> 33:22.520
And RawSteelUT follows that right up by saying, not as gimmicky as the Wii, oh snap.

33:22.520 --> 33:26.720
BlackDevilerX says, great, that'll give the PS3 another game.

33:26.720 --> 33:32.160
And RawSteelUT's also rolling his eyes going, ew, cross-platform, ew.

33:32.160 --> 33:37.780
I heard the cross-platform so far, you know, with Shadowrun's kind of not working.

33:37.780 --> 33:41.880
I don't want to give the definitive review on the game because I have not played it.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.980
I'm not going to attempt to review a game based on screenshots alone, but word on the

33:45.980 --> 33:50.420
street around my blogs and things of that nature is that Shadowrun sucks.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.480
And I, I don't know, I won't...

33:52.480 --> 33:56.120
What do you expect when you turn like a really awesome role-playing game and turn it into

33:56.120 --> 33:57.120
a multiplayer only...

33:57.120 --> 34:02.160
I fucking hate multiplayer only, you know, games out there.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.680
That is retarded.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.760
I don't want to play multiplayer games all the time.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.680
Sometimes I'm in the mood for it, sometimes I'm not.

34:08.680 --> 34:12.600
Okay, Psycoon's making angry face in chat says, Shadowrun fucking rocks.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.600
So maybe...

34:13.600 --> 34:17.560
It rocks, but it would have rocked even more as a fucking RPG, like it should be because

34:17.560 --> 34:18.560
it's a RPG.

34:18.560 --> 34:23.160
That would be, you know, a game that you can do like from FASTA or something that would

34:23.160 --> 34:27.480
be good, just multiplayer only would be MechWarrior or something like that.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.480
How did we get from talking about PlayStation 3's Ace and the whole game to talking about

34:31.480 --> 34:32.880
Shadowrun?

34:32.880 --> 34:34.380
Because they're cross-platform games.

34:34.380 --> 34:37.680
Do we talk about the 360 too much on this program, maybe on, oh yeah, they are both

34:37.680 --> 34:38.680
cross-platform games.

34:38.680 --> 34:39.680
It's because it's awesome.

34:39.680 --> 34:43.480
Okay, well, if you want to talk about cross-platform games that suck, Marvel Trading Card Game

34:43.480 --> 34:46.200
on PSP and cross-platform with the PC.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.200
Okay.

34:47.200 --> 34:48.200
Woo-wee.

34:48.200 --> 34:49.200
Okay, fair enough.

34:49.200 --> 34:50.200
I guess we can all agree on that.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.200
There you go.

34:51.200 --> 34:52.200
All right, help.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.200
Save us from this debate, DarkSakura.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.200
Silent Hill 5.

34:54.200 --> 34:55.200
Ooh, yes.

34:55.200 --> 34:56.200
You got my attention.

34:56.200 --> 35:02.520
Might have a US developer, but it could happen, it could not happen, so we don't know.

35:02.520 --> 35:07.200
They're like, it could happen, but it could not, so we don't know.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.200
Again, rumor.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.200
Can we do something else now?

35:09.200 --> 35:10.560
I fucking hate stories like that.

35:10.560 --> 35:13.200
No offense, Jamie, because I know you're just reading what is...

35:13.200 --> 35:14.200
I didn't pick it out.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.200
I know.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
I know you're just reading what...

35:16.200 --> 35:17.200
Someone picked this like they picked their nose.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.000
I know you're just reading what all the video game blogs are reporting on this week, which

35:20.000 --> 35:24.520
is fine, but this is not news.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.520
This is not news.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.520
La, la, la.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.080
I could hear once.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.080
Really?

35:30.080 --> 35:40.200
I mean, we all know that Silent Hill 5 is coming out soon, but to hear that it might

35:40.200 --> 35:46.120
have a developer that might be doing this with it, how is that news?

35:46.120 --> 35:47.800
That's even better, is it may or may not.

35:47.800 --> 35:54.040
Wow, thank you for covering all sides of possibilities right there, because there were only two.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.040
It may or may not.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.280
It's sorted us.

35:56.280 --> 36:03.840
I mean, you can't have like, it's, you can't have 50% on that.

36:03.840 --> 36:07.480
They're a US developer that's right on the border of Mexico or something like that.

36:07.480 --> 36:11.680
They're built on the border, so half of them are Mexican, half of them are in the US, so

36:11.680 --> 36:13.360
it's halfway true.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.200
No, it's being done by the Hawaiian division.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.200
Which closed.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.200
No, it's not.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.880
They all got sent out to sea, didn't you hear?

36:20.880 --> 36:23.080
Well, no wonder why the game's not going to get finished.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.080
Exactly.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.080
It's like sent to Hawaii, some guy's like, what the fuck is this?

36:27.080 --> 36:31.000
Pyramid Head went snorkeling, you'll just have to deal.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.920
Silent Hill, Xtreme Beach Volleyball.

36:32.920 --> 36:39.220
You know, if this is, dude, the nurses are pretty hot, actually.

36:39.220 --> 36:43.180
You know, if this is what the news is going to be like this week, then seriously, Orange

36:43.180 --> 36:47.520
Lounge Radio has been preempted this week for the Dead or Alive movie discussion.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.440
Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.760
How did I actually watch that?

36:52.760 --> 36:53.760
See?

36:53.760 --> 36:54.760
Street Fighter II movie.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.760
Anyhow.

36:55.760 --> 36:59.540
That movie was all about Kylie Minogue.

36:59.540 --> 37:01.000
That movie killed Raul Julia.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.680
It was his last movie, that's true.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.680
It killed him.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.000
He could have had- Not even the life support suit could bring

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
him back.

37:09.000 --> 37:15.520
He could have had even more years left, and that movie is just like, ugh, ugh, ugh.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.520
He didn't even go- That's so rude.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.520
He didn't even go Psycho Crusher once.

37:17.520 --> 37:20.600
Didn't he have an HBO movie, actually?

37:20.600 --> 37:21.600
Like that didn't count.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.640
That was a movie that was Clint Eastwood, wasn't it?

37:24.640 --> 37:29.120
Yeah, I just bought The Addams Family on DVD right before I left for New York.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.280
That's Raul Julia at his finest.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.280
That's how I prefer to remember him.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.580
The Addams Family is fucking awesome.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.080
And Addams Family values.

37:35.080 --> 37:41.080
Oh, and then SSJ-100 Matt comes up with the perfect witty retort that only our chat room

37:41.080 --> 37:42.880
can come up with.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.320
Pyramid Head snorkels and gets taken out by a stingray barb.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.000
That's just lovely.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Too soon.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Too soon.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
No, no, no.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.400
Pyramid Head would probably just poke the thing with his big pointy head.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.400
You know what?

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
Seriously, I don't have to work tomorrow.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.360
I'm gonna go get some liquor, I think.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.360
That's my help.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.360
That's my help me through tonight's show.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.360
That doesn't help me through tonight's show, Bob.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
You want some?

38:04.360 --> 38:06.360
I'm trying to know something very disappointing.

38:06.360 --> 38:11.120
I went to go get some root beer, you know, the nice root beer, and it fucking wasn't

38:11.120 --> 38:12.120
there.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.120
Nice root beer.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.120
No, not that.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
That's diet shit.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.120
Diet is never nice.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.920
So, all they have is fucking vanilla cream.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.120
I fucking hate cream soda.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.120
I hate it.

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
Hate it.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.120
Hate it.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.120
Hate it.

38:24.120 --> 38:27.760
Was there a video game show here once, or was it just me?

38:27.760 --> 38:28.760
Root beer tapper.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.680
See, it ties in.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.840
I am not deviating from the show's plan.

38:33.840 --> 38:37.120
I am talking about video games, or at least one step into video games.

38:37.120 --> 38:41.000
Alright, I'm gonna read this story so I can go get some booze.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Here it is.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Let's see.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.160
Oh, this is actually, this is real news, actually.

38:48.160 --> 38:53.080
Sony finally got themselves an official blog.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.080
Let's give Sony a round of applause.

38:56.080 --> 39:01.120
Congratulations, Sony, you finally caught on, and you got yourselves a blog.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.080
You finally figured out, hey, maybe that Major Nelson.

39:03.080 --> 39:06.240
You know, he seems to stay in touch with the community pretty good.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.640
Xbox 360 seems to know what they're doing with the community.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.920
Nintendo, they have Reggie.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.080
Very likable, very personable guy.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.400
Maybe Ken Kudaragi, Crayon Eater.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.920
So what can we do?

39:15.920 --> 39:17.380
So they finally launched a blog.

39:17.380 --> 39:18.560
Good job, Sony.

39:18.560 --> 39:23.280
And you can read it for yourself, blog.us.playstation.com.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.280
And look at this.

39:24.280 --> 39:28.960
At least this one's not faking the B.A., like an independent blog, like, was it that all

39:28.960 --> 39:30.840
I want for Christmas is a PSP shit?

39:30.840 --> 39:33.040
Yeah, this is actually fairly well done.

39:33.040 --> 39:36.240
I mean, this is really what I think folks have been asking for.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.040
There's some articles here, they're pretty honest.

39:39.040 --> 39:45.000
This guy who is the U.S. producer for MotorStorm is talking about the patch and how the 1.2

39:45.000 --> 39:48.320
is going to have this time attack mode, and then talking about how, like, there's a bug

39:48.320 --> 39:49.320
in the game.

39:49.320 --> 39:53.760
There was another post that's talking about the PS3 firmware update 1.81.

39:53.760 --> 39:58.600
And they kind of have, like, a buffet of people, so to speak, writing for it.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.380
And it's actually not bad.

40:00.380 --> 40:02.040
So good job, Sony.

40:02.040 --> 40:06.040
They're a little late in getting here, but, you know, I guess it was worth waiting for,

40:06.040 --> 40:07.240
so fair enough.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.240
Better late than never.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.240
I guess.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.240
That's very true.

40:10.240 --> 40:16.120
Well, one thing that's better late than never, well, I guess it's not good for Sony, but

40:16.120 --> 40:22.760
apparently people have already begun cracking the PlayStation firmwares.

40:22.760 --> 40:28.240
And this is probably no thanks to the fact that the PlayStation 3 software development

40:28.240 --> 40:31.440
kit got leaked a couple weeks ago out on the internet.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.840
So yeah, that only helps things along.

40:33.840 --> 40:42.160
But they've started with actually allowing, apparently versions 1.1 and 1.11 of the PS3

40:42.160 --> 40:49.880
firmwares can now access, I guess, burnt game ISOs where you can, it'll recognize burnt

40:49.880 --> 40:51.960
games, but it won't play them yet.

40:51.960 --> 40:58.240
So I guess that's the first step in getting backwards compatibility with some burnt games

40:58.240 --> 41:05.400
or possibly, I don't know, piracy, lots of pirated games, or homebrew.

41:05.400 --> 41:11.560
But right now, you know, nothing's coming of it, but, you know, they're working on it.

41:11.560 --> 41:15.720
But Sony has this to say about it.

41:15.720 --> 41:22.680
They don't like the fact that people want to put homebrew and pirate things on the PS3,

41:22.680 --> 41:27.600
so they have basically threatened people and said, unfortunately hackers will try to exploit

41:27.600 --> 41:30.240
any hardware system software.

41:30.240 --> 41:35.680
The best we can do as a company is to make our security that much stronger and aggressively

41:35.680 --> 41:40.760
pursue legal action against anyone caught trying to use an exploit in a legal manner.

41:40.760 --> 41:45.800
Naturally, any use of an exploit on the system software does void the warranty on your PlayStation

41:45.800 --> 41:51.640
3 system, which could be a costly mistake to see if you can run an old Sega CD game

41:51.640 --> 41:52.640
on it.

41:52.640 --> 41:56.440
I don't think anyone's going to try to run an old Sega CD game, ever.

41:56.440 --> 41:59.880
I would, but then again, I have old Sega CD games.

41:59.880 --> 42:04.480
But you know, and they claim that they're serious, which means that they're in serious

42:04.480 --> 42:05.480
trouble because...

42:05.480 --> 42:08.240
They're not going to be able to do crap!

42:08.240 --> 42:13.320
If the PS3 is so easy to crack this long, how many fucking updates have there been to

42:13.320 --> 42:14.880
the damn firmware?

42:14.880 --> 42:19.300
I mean, it's only a matter of time before they crack it, so.

42:19.300 --> 42:23.880
If you know you're not interested in going online and stuff, I would recommend keeping

42:23.880 --> 42:28.960
your firmware as low as possible, if you're interested in that piracy stuff.

42:28.960 --> 42:32.560
As far as homebrew, though, I mean, hello, you can install Linux on it.

42:32.560 --> 42:38.480
I mean, if you want to play old SNES games, you can fucking put it on Yellow Dog Linux,

42:38.480 --> 42:41.480
so who cares?

42:41.480 --> 42:42.480
Yay.

42:42.480 --> 42:45.480
Well, I have better news than that.

42:45.480 --> 42:49.040
This is happy news because I love the 80s.

42:49.040 --> 42:53.960
Guitar Hero Encore has more tracks listed, which is, like, super happy.

42:53.960 --> 42:59.000
So we have Hold On Loosely, that was, well, all of these, but one that I'm going to name

42:59.000 --> 43:04.040
was a cover, so the one that's not a cover is The Warrior by Scandal.

43:04.040 --> 43:09.520
Now the covers are Hold On Loosely from 38 Special, No One Like You by The Scorpions,

43:09.520 --> 43:14.120
Only Aladdin, Oingo Boingo, it's a cool song, Radar Love by White Lion, Ballroom Blitz by

43:14.120 --> 43:16.680
Crocus, a great name.

43:16.680 --> 43:17.840
Dude, Ballroom Blitz is awesome.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.480
I know, I like this song, I just always laugh at the band's name.

43:20.480 --> 43:24.000
Well, Like About You by The Romantics, and Wrath of Child by Iron Maiden, because Iron

43:24.000 --> 43:26.120
Maiden's fucking awesome.

43:26.120 --> 43:33.600
And others on the list, 18 in Life, Bathroom Wall, Lonely is the Night, Nothing But a Good

43:33.600 --> 43:38.000
Time, dude, Poison, Play With Me, Shaken, dude, I love Eddie, but it's like my favorite

43:38.000 --> 43:39.960
Eddie Munny song ever.

43:39.960 --> 43:46.040
Synchronicity 2, I Want to Rock, I Ran, of course, The Block of Seagulls, it's the actual

43:46.040 --> 43:54.240
song too, so is the Twisted Sister one, Round and Round, I Want Candy, Metal Health, Holy

43:54.240 --> 43:58.160
Diver, sorry, and Heat of the Moment.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.240
Are you excited about Guitar Heroes Rock Series?

44:00.240 --> 44:01.240
Hell yeah!

44:01.240 --> 44:03.980
I love my 80s rock.

44:03.980 --> 44:07.280
So I went to go make some liquor, which I don't have a lot to pick from because I didn't

44:07.280 --> 44:09.320
stock up before tonight's show.

44:09.320 --> 44:12.320
I mixed Malibu rum and root beer, how do you think that's going to turn out?

44:12.320 --> 44:13.320
Give me.

44:13.320 --> 44:14.320
Wait, I haven't tried it yet.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.320
You want to try it first?

44:15.320 --> 44:16.320
Alright, try that.

44:16.320 --> 44:21.400
Don't spill it on your laptop, for God's sake.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.080
Some bizarre shit that tastes like Dr. Pepper, which is nasty.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.080
Really?

44:25.080 --> 44:27.400
Everything tastes like Dr. Pepper when you mix it with alcohol.

44:27.400 --> 44:30.880
Let me try this.

44:30.880 --> 44:33.400
It kind of does taste like Dr. Pepper, it's not too bad.

44:33.400 --> 44:36.320
Well, I hate Dr. Pepper, so I'm finishing off my root beer.

44:36.320 --> 44:39.320
Dr. Pepper says that was a combination of everything.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.480
You want to know what's still in my fridge, by the way, Rob?

44:41.480 --> 44:44.240
The bottle of pineapple Malibu from Fauna Mae.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.240
Delicious.

44:45.240 --> 44:47.560
I think DevilerX wants to know, Sky, what kind of root beer?

44:47.560 --> 44:48.560
It's Diet IBC.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.560
Ew.

44:49.560 --> 44:50.560
There we go.

44:50.560 --> 44:54.280
Alright, so I mixed it with Malibu, because that's all I had.

44:54.280 --> 44:57.520
I had that and citrus vodka, and I knew that would be really bad.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.520
You should mix with vodka and the Malibu.

44:59.520 --> 45:00.520
We'll see, we'll see.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.160
Drink that like a shot.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.920
Can I do a video game story, please?

45:03.920 --> 45:04.920
No.

45:04.920 --> 45:05.920
Okay.

45:05.920 --> 45:06.920
Alright.

45:06.920 --> 45:11.160
Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the Playstation 3, not that you may have heard that somewhere

45:11.160 --> 45:16.680
before, where it was soon after retracted, but we can officially, with permission, tell

45:16.680 --> 45:22.340
you now that Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the Playstation 3 with a GunCon controller,

45:22.340 --> 45:29.700
and of course, Famitsu, they were the first to break this news about Time Crisis 4 coming

45:29.700 --> 45:30.920
to the Playstation 3.

45:30.920 --> 45:33.560
You hadn't heard it anywhere before then.

45:33.560 --> 45:37.800
The Playstation 3 version will have an arcade mode, and it's just going to be just like

45:37.800 --> 45:41.440
the arcade game, which is pretty awesome.

45:41.440 --> 45:44.420
So if you like Time Crisis, you're going to be really excited about this game, I'm sure.

45:44.420 --> 45:48.240
There is a GunCon controller that's coming out with this, which is kind of ugly.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.520
It's orange, and kind of looks like the Zapper.

45:50.520 --> 45:52.760
Not as ugly as the dude holding it, dude.

45:52.760 --> 45:53.760
That guy is fugly.

45:53.760 --> 45:54.760
That's cool, though.

45:54.760 --> 45:59.400
I was reading that they're going to have first person shooter portions of the game.

45:59.400 --> 46:01.880
That's why the GunCon's so weird looking.

46:01.880 --> 46:03.020
That's kind of cool, though.

46:03.020 --> 46:05.640
And apparently, they're going to have, it functions like the Wii.

46:05.640 --> 46:08.680
You put these things on the left and right side of your TV, kind of like how on the Wii

46:08.680 --> 46:14.360
you have the LED bar, and then there's a camera inside the actual gun, and that determines

46:14.360 --> 46:16.280
where the markers are at.

46:16.280 --> 46:21.080
So that means, that way you can use the GunCon, whether you have an LCD, a plasma, whatever.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.920
It'll work on any type of TV, which is good news.

46:23.920 --> 46:28.440
What's kind of neat, though, and I mean, how many GunCon games are out there?

46:28.440 --> 46:29.780
I mean, really not that many.

46:29.780 --> 46:35.600
I think that this would be awesome for first person shooters, because you've got, basically,

46:35.600 --> 46:40.280
on the front grip of the gun, you have kind of the second half of a Playstation controller.

46:40.280 --> 46:44.680
You've got your own analog stick and two shoulder buttons, and then on the back of the gun there's

46:44.680 --> 46:47.280
another analog stick right by the trigger.

46:47.280 --> 46:55.560
So in a sense, this would be the perfect solution for, you know, gun games or first person shooters.

46:55.560 --> 46:59.880
That way you can control your looking camera with, you know, the right analog stick, control

46:59.880 --> 47:04.400
your movement with the left analog stick, and then you can free aim with the gun.

47:04.400 --> 47:09.240
I mean, it's fucking awesome, except they will never use it like that and it will suck,

47:09.240 --> 47:10.240
so dammit.

47:10.240 --> 47:11.240
Frustration.

47:11.240 --> 47:18.560
Camara in chat says, it's upgraded Duck Hunt.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.560
Pretty much.

47:19.560 --> 47:20.560
Pretty much.

47:20.560 --> 47:21.560
I guess so.

47:21.560 --> 47:22.560
Sure.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.560
Sure, you got it.

47:23.560 --> 47:24.560
Upgraded Duck Hunt.

47:24.560 --> 47:25.560
Duck Hunt 2 coming out.

47:25.560 --> 47:26.560
Funny story.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.600
I'm not sure about Duck Hunt, but I heard that some old NES Zapper games, you could

47:29.600 --> 47:35.560
actually get perfect scores by aiming the light gun at a light and just keep shooting

47:35.560 --> 47:36.560
at the light.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.880
Or put a magnifying glass in front of a light gun.

47:38.880 --> 47:41.640
That's the other trick.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.640
Works like a charm.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.620
Anyhow, so there it is.

47:44.620 --> 47:48.360
GunCon Time Crisis 3 coming to the Playstation 3 very soon.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.360
Yay.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.360
Awesome.

47:50.360 --> 47:51.520
And another thing that was announced for Playstation 3.

47:51.520 --> 47:52.880
Wake me up when they have point blank.

47:52.880 --> 47:53.880
That's all I have to say.

47:53.880 --> 47:54.880
Sorry.

47:54.880 --> 47:55.880
That would be awesome.

47:55.880 --> 48:00.500
And for the 360, Soul Calibur IV.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.760
Because we knew that Soul Calibur Legends couldn't be possibly the only game coming

48:03.760 --> 48:04.760
out.

48:04.760 --> 48:11.400
Soul Calibur IV will be coming out, they claim, that's going to be 60 frames per second.

48:11.400 --> 48:15.280
I read somewhere 90 frames per second, which would be stupid.

48:15.280 --> 48:19.680
But not that you would be able to see that.

48:19.680 --> 48:24.080
And then also that it's going to possibly be 1080p.

48:24.080 --> 48:30.220
The other thing, apparently everybody's been talking about certain characters getting boob

48:30.220 --> 48:31.720
upgrades in the game.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.880
It's just a fucking game, folks.

48:33.880 --> 48:39.000
But the teaser video that they had for it didn't really reveal too much because it was

48:39.000 --> 48:40.960
just still shots.

48:40.960 --> 48:47.000
Well, I'm just glad, you know, I know most games we joke about are obvious that they're

48:47.000 --> 48:52.080
coming like Silent Hill 5, Final Fantasy XIV someday, you know, and all these other series.

48:52.080 --> 48:56.680
I wasn't 100% for sure that there was going to be another Soul Calibur game, because I

48:56.680 --> 49:00.040
could have sworn they said with this last one, that's it, kids.

49:00.040 --> 49:03.840
And then the fact that, you know, the arcade release came later.

49:03.840 --> 49:09.400
There was a comment on Sony's website saying that Soul Calibur III was exclusive for PS2

49:09.400 --> 49:12.080
and any future Soul Calibur games.

49:12.080 --> 49:17.400
I was wondering, what happened with the decision with Soul Calibur IV being multi-console now?

49:17.400 --> 49:22.500
Well, you see what happened is that Microsoft actually sold consoles, so that's why the

49:22.500 --> 49:24.760
decision was made to go multi-platform, I guess.

49:24.760 --> 49:27.480
It could be the 4 million console leave that they have.

49:27.480 --> 49:30.920
Or there's this whole rumor thing, I mean, because Sony or the fanboys are writing the

49:30.920 --> 49:34.460
hate mail right now, but also look at this, is that Namco, and you know, you'll see this

49:34.460 --> 49:39.200
throughout some other stories you may hear tonight or may not, is that Namco and Microsoft

49:39.200 --> 49:42.200
are starting to be in bed together, you might notice.

49:42.200 --> 49:45.640
I mean, seriously, if you look at some of the decisions they've made recently and some

49:45.640 --> 49:49.600
of the things, I mean, not that they've abandoned PlayStation 3, but look at like, you know,

49:49.600 --> 49:55.680
Ace Combat and some of these other things, you know, Namco's kind of, you know, getting

49:55.680 --> 49:58.680
in bed with my, they're going out to dinner, they're giving each other, you know, sensual

49:58.680 --> 50:02.480
massages, they're, you know, they're getting to know each other a little bit here, getting

50:02.480 --> 50:03.480
comfy.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.480
Fucking popping out this goddamn Pac-Man sequel, babies.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.480
There you go.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.520
The true sequel.

50:09.520 --> 50:10.520
True sequel.

50:10.520 --> 50:13.680
Yeah, then the next fucking true sequel game.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.080
I love Soul Calibur, it's one of my favorite fighting game projects.

50:16.080 --> 50:19.040
I love Rod Calibur.

50:19.040 --> 50:20.280
With the Dreamcast thing?

50:20.280 --> 50:22.360
With the Dreamcast fishing rod, Rod Calibur.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.480
You just told that story like last time we had a show.

50:24.480 --> 50:29.400
I know, but every time I think of Soul Calibur, I think of Rod Calibur and how great it is.

50:29.400 --> 50:30.400
Fair enough.

50:30.400 --> 50:32.720
We need a new fishing controller for more Rod Calibur fun.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.120
I think about Ivy and how great she is.

50:35.120 --> 50:41.820
I think about trying to play Soul Calibur on the DDR pad on Dreamcast, and the only

50:41.820 --> 50:45.720
analog button was like the Konami logo.

50:45.720 --> 50:48.400
You're tapping your fingers like you want to say something, Loki.

50:48.400 --> 50:50.240
I'm not tapping my fingers because I want to say anything.

50:50.240 --> 50:52.120
He has a nervous twitch.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.120
It's because I'm only through Pepsi.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.560
You want to go get some Malibu?

50:56.560 --> 50:57.560
No, no, I'm good.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.360
Oh, actually, I was reminded that I cracked open alcohol in the studio without giving

51:01.360 --> 51:06.360
the OLR alcohol disclaimer, because we may have some young'uns who listen, and so just

51:06.360 --> 51:08.840
so you know, whenever we drink on the program, we do it responsibly.

51:08.840 --> 51:11.960
I live here, so I can drink because I'm not going to drive.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.560
That's why Jamie and Matt can't drink tonight, because they didn't make other arrangements,

51:14.560 --> 51:16.440
because they didn't know I was going to crack open the liquor.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.360
Matt, you have nasty alcohol here.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.760
And don't drink by yourself.

51:20.760 --> 51:22.920
And don't drink lots of water.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.760
Yes, and please don't drink lots of water and not pee.

51:25.760 --> 51:28.920
And don't sit on the ground drinking nothing but vodka and orange juice.

51:28.920 --> 51:29.920
All right, there.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.280
There's your disclaimer.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.280
Back to news.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.280
Hey, I have...

51:33.280 --> 51:34.280
Anything else on Soul Calibur?

51:34.280 --> 51:35.280
Sorry.

51:35.280 --> 51:36.280
Oh, yes.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.280
Explicit.

51:37.280 --> 51:39.000
Wait, wait, the raw Calibur?

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
That's...

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I mean, the DDR pad.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Soul Calibur.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
That's almost as best...

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
It doesn't work.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.280
That's almost as bizarre as someone trying to perform Shoryuken on a Street Fighter with

51:48.280 --> 51:49.280
the DDR pad.

51:49.280 --> 51:50.280
Seen it happen.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.280
Seen it done.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.280
Shoryuken!

51:52.280 --> 51:58.600
It actually is much easier to do the... to do that with the DDR pad.

51:58.600 --> 52:01.200
I'm going to try some of those Xbox Live Arcade games I didn't like.

52:01.200 --> 52:05.160
Like, I'm going to try Novadrome with the DDR pad and see if it's more fun.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.160
No.

52:06.160 --> 52:07.160
Maybe.

52:07.160 --> 52:10.680
Maybe if I drink a few more, it'll be fine.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.040
All right.

52:12.040 --> 52:14.040
No, what...

52:14.040 --> 52:19.520
I have an excellent idea for some of these crappy games out there, and it's an excellent

52:19.520 --> 52:20.520
idea for...

52:20.520 --> 52:21.520
A gun?

52:21.520 --> 52:22.520
No.

52:22.520 --> 52:23.520
Skeet shooting?

52:23.520 --> 52:26.200
For the ultimate endurance test.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.680
Let me put it that way.

52:27.680 --> 52:28.680
Okay.

52:28.680 --> 52:30.880
DJ Genise in chat says, all video games are shit.

52:30.880 --> 52:33.160
Play with a jump rope.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.880
You might be listening to the wrong show, buddy.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.320
I don't know what to tell you.

52:37.320 --> 52:41.760
Well, you know, Microsoft would say jump in, so...

52:41.760 --> 52:42.760
Hitstun says you can kind of...

52:42.760 --> 52:43.760
Can I read my story, please?

52:43.760 --> 52:44.760
Yeah, all right.

52:44.760 --> 52:45.760
Wait, one more check on it.

52:45.760 --> 52:48.600
Hitstun says you can kind of play Street Fighter on a 2DX controller.

52:48.600 --> 52:51.600
You just can't... you just can't go left.

52:51.600 --> 52:52.600
Oh, well...

52:52.600 --> 52:55.160
So just be player one?

52:55.160 --> 53:00.720
I guess so, and hope that player two never thinks to jump over you or else you're fucked.

53:00.720 --> 53:02.880
I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.

53:02.880 --> 53:09.680
Anyway, for those who are keeping up with the PS1 games that were to be coming out on

53:09.680 --> 53:16.120
the PSN, PlayStation Store, or whatever the hell they're calling it, we have Crash Bandicoot,

53:16.120 --> 53:22.840
Wipeout, Medieval, Jumping Flash, and Syphon Filter that will be available on, looks like

53:22.840 --> 53:23.840
next Friday.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.560
Actually, no, is it this Friday?

53:26.560 --> 53:27.800
No, take that back.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.760
Next Friday, sorry.

53:29.760 --> 53:36.280
It will be available for PS3 and PSP, but you can only buy them from the PS3 store.

53:36.280 --> 53:37.520
I'm guessing that's for the UK.

53:37.520 --> 53:38.520
For the UK, yes.

53:38.520 --> 53:39.520
I'm sorry.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.520
My apologies.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.560
Also going to be available is on 22nd June.

53:42.560 --> 53:46.920
There will be Calling All Cars and Super Stardust HD on June 29th.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.880
I heard Calling All Cars sucks.

53:50.880 --> 53:51.880
Take that, Dave Jeff.

53:51.880 --> 53:55.960
Well, I don't like to say that anything sucks until I've actually either seen it in play

53:55.960 --> 53:57.960
or have played it myself.

53:57.960 --> 54:01.160
No, I think I'm going to pass judgment before I play it.

54:01.160 --> 54:04.720
I know, I actually do that a lot, actually.

54:04.720 --> 54:07.320
Sometimes I'm wrong.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.440
I wrote off Halo.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.320
I was like, I will never like that game.

54:10.320 --> 54:13.040
I haven't liked a first-person shooter since Quake.

54:13.040 --> 54:14.040
Halo's going to suck.

54:14.040 --> 54:18.520
And then I actually played it at, get this, my friend's wedding reception.

54:18.520 --> 54:23.920
They had a Halo-themed wedding reception, and they had TVs all land together and played

54:23.920 --> 54:24.920
Halo.

54:24.920 --> 54:27.360
They actually had a cake with Master Chief on it, and that was the first time I ever

54:27.360 --> 54:28.880
played Halo, and I had a blast.

54:28.880 --> 54:35.000
So you can't always judge by looking, but some of the time you can.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Some of the time you really can.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.960
I already know why I can't play Halo.

54:37.960 --> 54:38.960
Because of the motion sickness thing.

54:38.960 --> 54:39.960
Yep.

54:39.960 --> 54:40.960
Sorry to hear it.

54:40.960 --> 54:41.960
All right.

54:41.960 --> 54:47.200
Well, let's talk about some upcoming games that you may or may not be playing in the

54:47.200 --> 54:48.200
near future.

54:48.200 --> 54:51.640
We like to travel the world when we do these releases, so let's take a look at the Japanese

54:51.640 --> 54:57.200
release dates and listen to me horribly mispronounce some game name titles, shall we?

54:57.200 --> 55:03.120
Coming out on the 21st on the Xbox 360, Saints Row finally in Japan, Shadowrun also coming

55:03.120 --> 55:09.120
out in Japan, and some other games coming to the Asian region, such as Vampire Rain.

55:09.120 --> 55:14.600
Also I want to point out Def Jam Icon also comes out from EA on the Xbox 360, all on

55:14.600 --> 55:16.320
June 21st.

55:16.320 --> 55:23.200
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 21st is Hajime no Ippo Revolution, which looks

55:23.200 --> 55:26.320
to be another type of anime-based video game.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.320
Oh no, it's a sports title.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.320
It's a boxing title.

55:28.320 --> 55:29.320
Yeah.

55:29.320 --> 55:30.320
That's actually what it is.

55:30.320 --> 55:31.320
First something.

55:31.320 --> 55:32.320
Kind of cool.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.320
I don't remember what it's called.

55:35.320 --> 55:37.080
It's an anime series that's over here too.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.080
Gotcha.

55:38.080 --> 55:42.000
So I'm sure somebody in chat knows, and you might be wondering why isn't it Punch Out?

55:42.000 --> 55:46.160
Because this is made by AQ Interactive, not a Nintendo in-house production.

55:46.160 --> 55:51.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, a port of Def Jam Icon over there, as well as Monster

55:51.000 --> 55:55.140
Kingdom coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on the 21st.

55:55.140 --> 55:59.200
If you prefer to keep it with the current systems on the PlayStation 2, there's still

55:59.200 --> 56:01.120
quite a few games coming out.

56:01.120 --> 56:05.640
The Art of Fighting Collection moves into the best hits, and that comes out in Japan

56:05.640 --> 56:07.200
on the 21st.

56:07.200 --> 56:10.760
Also coming out, this is my favorite game name of the week.

56:10.760 --> 56:15.000
It's Fun Super Combo.

56:15.000 --> 56:20.540
That's F-U-U-U-N Super Combo.

56:20.540 --> 56:25.000
This actually just looks like a Neo Geo compilation of some of the games there that SNK put out

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
previously.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
I bet they're pretty fun.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
I bet they are fun.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.560
Dude, it will be fun unless Psycho Soldier is one of them.

56:32.560 --> 56:35.680
Lots and lots of SNK loving this week in Japan, by the way.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.880
There's a King of Fighters thing coming out too.

56:37.880 --> 56:39.560
Are any of them new?

56:39.560 --> 56:43.200
If you're on the DS, I've got news for you.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.480
This could be the game of the year right here.

56:45.480 --> 56:52.400
Hello Kitty no Gattuchi Collection, Koi no Doki Doki Trouble is coming out.

56:52.400 --> 56:57.680
And the box is beautifully pink with Hello Kitty wearing a bunny suit.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.680
I think she's confused.

56:58.680 --> 57:01.920
No, this is made by Rocket Company, not SNK.

57:01.920 --> 57:04.280
That's on the Nintendo DS.

57:04.280 --> 57:08.700
I'm checking to see real quick if there's anything on the PSP, looking at my list here.

57:08.700 --> 57:12.400
See if there's anything on the PSP coming to Japan.

57:12.400 --> 57:17.060
Well, the Katamari Damacy game that was on the PSP moves into best hits, so you can get

57:17.060 --> 57:21.640
that a little cheaper over in Japan, otherwise not a lot of new stuff.

57:21.640 --> 57:24.840
Loco Roco also moves into best hits.

57:24.840 --> 57:25.840
Check it out.

57:25.840 --> 57:29.160
What about the Capcom vs SNK card fighting game?

57:29.160 --> 57:30.160
What's that?

57:30.160 --> 57:35.280
What about the Capcom vs SNK fighting card game that came out a while ago?

57:35.280 --> 57:39.740
It came out here, but it got recalled because it was fucked up, but they're fixing it for

57:39.740 --> 57:41.440
Europe where I don't believe it's been released.

57:41.440 --> 57:45.680
But remember the cool thing about the DS is they're not region locked, so you can buy,

57:45.680 --> 57:48.640
if you really want this game, you can import Europe's version or something and it'll be

57:48.640 --> 57:52.720
English and not fucked up, so something to think about.

57:52.720 --> 57:57.080
Alright, let's get to some more release dates, shall we?

57:57.080 --> 58:03.040
Alright, this week there's actually a few things coming out in the US, starting off

58:03.040 --> 58:04.520
with some weird games.

58:04.520 --> 58:08.240
PlayStation 2, The Adventures of Darwin.

58:08.240 --> 58:09.960
This is a little interesting.

58:09.960 --> 58:14.140
You basically, it's almost like a portion of Spore.

58:14.140 --> 58:19.840
You start off with a civilization that's pretty retarded and caveman-like, and you teach them

58:19.840 --> 58:23.560
to be more civilized.

58:23.560 --> 58:28.640
Then the Hitman trilogy is coming out, including the first three games of the Hitman series,

58:28.640 --> 58:31.040
so that's pretty interesting.

58:31.040 --> 58:37.640
On Xbox 360, we have Dirt coming out, which is an awesome off-road racing game, so definitely

58:37.640 --> 58:39.640
check that out.

58:39.640 --> 58:46.960
PS3, PQ2, remember those old IQ games, this one should be pretty cool.

58:46.960 --> 58:52.920
Hot Brain is going to be coming out on the PSP, another brain-training sim.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.960
PuzzleScape, another puzzle game.

58:55.960 --> 59:00.580
Dungeon Maker, Hunting Ground, a very interesting role-playing game with a little bit of sim

59:00.580 --> 59:04.640
aspects in there, that's going to be coming out as well.

59:04.640 --> 59:08.840
On PlayStation 3, you got a big fat nothing.

59:08.840 --> 59:12.280
Rainbow Six Vegas was going to be coming out this week, but once again, it's been delayed

59:12.280 --> 59:15.520
yet another week.

59:15.520 --> 59:20.480
The Wii, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is going to be making its way out, so that's going

59:20.480 --> 59:22.120
to be pretty cool.

59:22.120 --> 59:27.040
And the DS, Time Ace, which is that Konami game that we played that's, I guess, sequel

59:27.040 --> 59:32.720
to Time Pilot, I was the only one that kind of pointed that out, but Zendoku is going

59:32.720 --> 59:35.480
to be coming out, yet another Sudoku game.

59:35.480 --> 59:39.120
SimCity DS, Rob, possibly a game that you might want to pick up?

59:39.120 --> 59:40.120
Maybe, maybe.

59:40.120 --> 59:43.360
I have so many games, I still have World of Warcraft to worry about on top of all the

59:43.360 --> 59:47.480
other new crap I've got, so, I don't know, too many games, too many games, it's not even

59:47.480 --> 59:48.480
Christmas yet.

59:48.480 --> 59:53.400
The Transformers game is coming out a little bit early for the DS, you have both the Autobots

59:53.400 --> 59:56.740
and Decepticons games going to be heading your way.

59:56.740 --> 59:59.680
So there is more than meets the eye to these games.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:06.800
And then finally, NPC, Dirt is also coming out, as well as the Hitman trilogy.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:13.760
They're actually putting out, yet again, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, and The Sims Pet Stories

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.480
will be making its way out.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.480
Goody, goody.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.340
You know, I went to the new Fry's Electronics they built out in Roseville, which is all,

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.340
you know, train things out there.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:23.340
Very trainalicious.

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.000
It's cute, it's cute, it's a cute store.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.040
You know, the Sacramento fries is unlike any other fries because it doesn't have a theme,

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.080
but all the other fries around the world have themes.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.320
But anyway, the point is, I was looking at computer games just randomly, because I was

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.880
thinking about maybe buying a new computer game, I was actually, I don't know why, I

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:43.320
was tempted for like half a second to get the Lord of the Rings MMO, even though I know,

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.200
it's like, I'm like, oh, I kind of want to try it for no good reason.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.200
But I didn't get it.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.680
But I was looking at computer games, not even kidding, one entire shelf, almost like two

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:57.240
actually, dedicated to The Sims and all their spinoff series.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.840
I mean, which is, I mean, it is one of the, what, the best selling game ever.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.480
How many shelves are dedicated to the Tycoon series?

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.640
I don't even want to know.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.680
Well, how about some different release dates?

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.000
How about it?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.280
For our friends in the UK, coming out on the 22nd, we have Calling All Cars, like I said

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:23.840
earlier, we have Flat Out Ultimate Carnage, Hot Pixel, Hour of Victory, Kirby Mouse Attack,

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:30.580
Mario Party 8, Metroid Prime Pinball, Monster Madness, Pac-Man Rally, Sega Presents Touch

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:34.560
Darts, and Cosmic Family.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.400
Metroid Prime Pinball just now?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.920
You poor kids over in the UK.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.920
I mean, it's not that that game was like that great, but seriously, that game came out here,

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920
what, like six months ago?

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.920
Fuck that shit.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.640
They get Flat Out before I do.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.880
I mean, I want Flat Out for the 360 so I can launch my driver through the window and into

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.880
things.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.160
It's one game early and, you know, they're bastards.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.320
Hey, they have Tomb Raider early, whatever, okay.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Yay.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.240
Are you excited about Tomb Raider?

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:09.320
That's what I thought.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.600
Let's talk about gaming on the Mac, shall we?

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.960
Because we don't always get to talk about this and Loki usually has a field day with

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.960
this topic, but, you know, there was a pretty big keynote done, sorry, I've been drinking.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.320
There's been a keynote done by Steve Jobs, did this, the Worldwide Developers Conference

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:33.520
did a keynote and he talked about at the keynote that there are going to be, excuse me, I was

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520
very professional, sorry.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520
Yay.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.600
I don't get a sneeze, but there's going to be coughing all over the Macintosh computers.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.960
No, here's what's really going on.

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:45.640
They announced at the conference that Apple is going to be teaming up with EA and Electronic

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:51.240
Arts is actually going to be putting out some of their games onto the Macs.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:57.360
Command and Conquer 3, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter, and Madden and Tiger Woods 08.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.280
So there you go, gaming on the Mac.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.920
About fucking time.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.280
Well, I think they've had some games before this, but, you know, EA is definitely stepping

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.680
it up a notch on the Macintosh, so that's pretty cool.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:15.840
Another thing that's being shown off as well is id's Tech 5 engine, it's going to be their

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.420
fifth generation 3D engine.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:25.020
You might remember them from such games as Quake 4, Doom 3, and all those other fun things.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:32.960
Of course, they said that their new engine will also be able to run on Mac OS X.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960
So that's good.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:39.000
So you're actually going to get some pretty decent games on the Mac, finally.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.880
And it's also, it says, not being built with Microsoft's DirectX 10, which makes sense

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.280
because not everyone wants to have Vista either.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.400
So that's pretty cool.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.000
And I guess this engine will also be able to run natively on the 360 and Playstation

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
3.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.120
So the tech demo that they showed looked pretty cool, kind of reminded me of Motorstorm a

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.400
bit, but very detailed, so I'm looking forward to some new games.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.740
Could this be a new Unreal engine?

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:12.040
You know how that's the engine that everybody is licensing for their games?

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.880
Could this be like the next great engine that everybody wants to license?

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:16.880
Possibly.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.160
I mean, Doom 3, the Doom 3 engine was, I mean, Quake 4 engine had a lot of things going for

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.160
it.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:27.180
Well, actually Quake 4 I think ran on the Doom 3 engine, so yeah, it could be the next

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.180
big engine.

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:32.280
I mean, if it does things that Unreal can't, personally, I think Crysis is going to be

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.780
fucking awesome.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.620
That engine is going to be nuts as far as the amount of detail that's in it, so they

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.720
have a real high bar to meet.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.240
Alright, well I guess we shall see.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.720
But I'm assuming, Loki, this doesn't exactly make you want to run out and buy a Mac.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720
Why?

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720
My PC can run games just fine.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720
I had a feeling.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.720
Although it's a bit old.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.360
I need a new one.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.480
A new PC!

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.120
PC, personal computer.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.880
I do need to get a Mac upgrade at some point.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.920
I want one of those pretty new Macs, the big screen laptop.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.920
Anyway.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.920
Sorry.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:12.760
Well, it looks like Capcom is going to start releasing titles through Steam.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:19.080
They're going to be putting out PC versions of Lost Planet, Onimusha 3, Devil May Cry

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:23.680
3, Special Edition, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.240
Can I add for matching service to that, just because I think it's funny?

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.280
Sure.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.120
But I did not know that the Puzzle Fighter game was coming to the computers.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.960
Or did I just miss that in the initial announcement?

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:36.960
I guess so.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.520
Well, it says here that Capcom PC releases are going to be made available through Steam,

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
so.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
Apparently.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
Well, there you go.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520
Well, that's pretty cool.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.480
And I might add that their fucking Street Fighter 2 HD game looks fucking awesome.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:55.560
And I think that they've set the bar pretty high for any new 2D fighting games coming

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560
out.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.120
I'm not going to see Guilty Gear in that much detail.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.780
It does look pretty hot, but it's going to do the same thing that Pac-Man CE did to Pac-Man

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:08.840
on Xbox Live Arcade, is it's going to piss you off that you bought the first one.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:13.480
When this Street Fighter 2 HD version comes out, it's an arcade release, right?

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.480
Uh, yeah.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.480
Yeah.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.800
It's going to make you mad that you ever bought the Championship Edition release that came

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.480
out last year.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.480
So.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.080
I have every other version, why not?

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.080
I guess so.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080
There you have it.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:31.280
Well, if you are a computer gamer, then you certainly know the series Monkey Island.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.480
You remember this series of games, Monkey Island?

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.480
It's about pirates.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.480
Hell yeah.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.480
Huh?

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.480
Oh, hell yeah.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.480
Well, hell yeah.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480
Well, guess what?

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:44.640
Apparently, going around LucasArts is rumblings of a fifth Monkey Island game.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.160
The fifth Monkey Island game is coming.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.120
I know some of the guys who worked on the music compositions for the original PC classics,

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.600
and they say that it's currently being planned amidst rumors.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:58.760
However, LucasArts has so many things on its belt right now, including a Wii title that

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.040
is yet to be named.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.960
Don't expect any revitalizations of its classic graphic adventures until 2008 at the earliest.

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.520
That's coming from RumorReporter.com.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:12.000
You know, this is a game that needs to be made into a movie.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Monkey Island series.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.120
It'd be awesome.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.920
You know, with Sam & Max doing as well as it's doing critically, I mean, there's no

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.820
reason why they shouldn't bring this back, and it would be kind of interesting to see

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:25.400
it on a console, although these games will always kind of be PC games to me.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:28.320
Yeah, they're pretty cool, though.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.360
So we talked about it a while back that, you know, Playboy was going to be coming to Second

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.360
Life.

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:40.600
Well, they finally opened their doors in a fun little bunny-shaped island, and what can

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.760
you find possibly on Playboy Island, you may ask?

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:52.500
Well, plenty of bunny paraphernalia from its site, Playboy.com and ShopTheBunny.com.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.500
Fake women?

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.720
Yes, fake women.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:08:03.760
You'll be able to buy avatars or merchandise for your avatars, and also for, you know,

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.840
like fake bunny shirts and fake bunny ears.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.880
Or you can buy real merchandise that, you know, can get shipped to your house.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.880
All right.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880
Fair enough.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.880
All right.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880
So slash Playboy instead of slash pizza.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:19.440
I know they're going to have, you know, characters running around dressed up like the classic

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.840
bunnies, so that's kind of neat.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.440
And yeah, I guess they're going to be also doing other, like, events and stuff like that,

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.440
so.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440
Events?

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.960
Pool party!

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.120
Fake pool party.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120
Fake barbecue.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.200
But I love, I was reading some of the comments on the story, and it was kind of funny because

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.640
they were like, I'm just going to fake bomb this place.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:43.920
Well, actually, RawSteelUT read my mind in chat.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.920
Can you throw cocks at the Playboy models?

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:51.040
I think you can.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.240
Why?

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.480
Come on, the cock throwing story in Second Life was funny.

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.280
So what if it was like four months old, it's still funny?

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.320
Kind of.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.680
There you go.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.560
If I actually played Second Life, I would want to throw some cocks.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560
I mean, come on.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.560
What am I going to do?

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.600
Sit around and pretend I'm at the Playboy mansion?

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.480
I would build the massive cock launcher.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.440
It would be a giant cannon.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.760
That's all it would do.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.980
Because it's funny.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.640
That's why you would do it.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.640
Exactly.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:23.640
That and kittens.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640
It would shoot cocks and kittens.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.640
Cocks and kittens.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640
Hooray.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.640
You know, I'm kind of sad.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.080
I don't know if we're allowed to say this or whatever, but what the hell?

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.280
I'm going to say it anyway because I've been drinking.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.520
If you guys read about that Playboy event that happened at the Playboy mansion last

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:43.040
week with the whole, they were what, they were picking the gaming league folks or whatever.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.480
We got invited to that and we couldn't go.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.320
None of us could go.

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320
Sucks.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.820
I wanted to go.

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.820
We should have said Dark Side.

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.240
Dude, it was fucking lame.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240
Was it?

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.240
But it was at the Playboy mansion.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.240
It was lame.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.240
But it was at the Playboy mansion.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.680
Dude, it's for the god damn, was it the professional gaming league?

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:06.000
They're trying to make gaming, they're putting it on TV.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.920
I don't want to watch people play games.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:10.920
I fucking hate that.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.840
I want to play games or play games against other people.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.880
I don't want to have people watch me play games.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.200
Instead of watching basketball on TV, why not go play basketball?

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.200
Exactly.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.880
That's why I don't watch sports on TV.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:24.080
Well, you're just weird.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.920
But there's a lot of people out there that do enjoy watching other people play games.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.440
Don't you have friends that will come over and sit on the couch and watch you play?

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.440
No.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.440
They don't really want to play themselves?

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.440
They just will watch you play?

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.840
never comes over to watch me play, and Nellie hates watching me play games. She's like,

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.000
I want to watch TV instead!

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.480
Okay, Jamie, you do this to some extent, right? You've told stories on this show before when

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.080
you and Dan were gaming together that you like would help him through Resident Evil,

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.000
but you would just be kind of content watching him, right?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Yeah.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.880
So, would it be fair to say that some people are okay with just watching people play games?

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880
Yeah.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880
I don't know.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.400
Well, great. They can go ahead and start up their professional gaming league. It'll be

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.400
like the fucking XFL. It'll be around for a couple of years, and then it will fade into

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:14.220
dust, like it should, because no one wants to watch this shit. I mean, seriously, gamers

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.220
don't even watch...

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.640
But we were actually playing together.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:25.080
Okay, remember that stupid show on G4 Arena, okay? Remember that? I mean, granted, it had

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.580
an interesting idea, let's watch gamers play games, and it sucked. It sucked really, really

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.880
bad. You know why? Because it's watching people play games.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:38.120
The problem with Arena was just the way the show was kind of formulated. I don't think

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.440
it was the...

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:45.320
I don't give a shit about Joe Nobody, who fucking is like the Halo champ or something

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.920
like that, and ooh, ooh, he got a headshot in the game. No, I think I'm just going to

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.640
go back and play my own game now, thank you very much. I'm not going to subscribe to your

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.220
pay-per-view event sponsored by fucking, you know, I don't know, Rockstar or something

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:04.700
like that, so I can watch you play some stupid game that I could be playing right now and

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:09.800
win $50,000 and go, I'm the fucking awesome, let me make my own keyboard brand and sell

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.320
it for Uber money.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:22.000
Are you done? No? No, I'm done. You're such a dick, I swear to God.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.300
Okay, RawsteelUT brings up an excellent point. How about StarCade? StarCade was awesome,

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.280
and you watched other people play games, or Nick Arcade for that matter. Those games rocked.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.600
Okay, bring that shit back. I would love to see that. That's good, but fucking watching,

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:44.160
you know, clan members or whatever fucking play multiplayer games and shit, that's kind

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.840
of boring. But I'd be down for like an 80s-style show or something where it's just people facing

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.680
off in the arcades like their forefathers did.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.320
So you will watch people play games under the right circumstances.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.520
I'll play arcade games. Liar. Liar.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:04.560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Liar is not the right word. The word I'm thinking

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.400
of starts with an H. Homosexual?

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.520
Hypocrite. Oh, hypocrite.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.560
No, Rob, that's just you.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:19.000
All right. Anyway, that show's not on TV anymore, so fuck that, I don't care.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.640
All right, anyhow. And M60. Oh no, I guess GS68 said it first. Hentai? Was that the word

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.680
you were thinking? Hentai?

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.680
Dear Rob.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:37.080
Speaking of Hentai, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet every week.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.520
For YowieBoyFun.com.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.360
And I don't know what she's looking at, but she likes to, oh yes, explicit.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.240
Are you going to YowieCon?

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.240
Maybe.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.240
Of course.

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.640
Everyone's trying to invite me to it.

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:57.360
Why would you go to YowieCon? I don't even want to go to YowieCon. Why would you go to

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.360
YowieCon?

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.040
No, because everybody like, you know, all those groups and cosplayers, they all want

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.280
me to, oh, come on, go.

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:11.300
As I understand it, let's talk about Yowie for a minute. Why not? This is an appropriate

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:17.440
lead into Dark Soccer's website of the week. Let's talk about a little bit of Yowie.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:24.200
For those of you guys that don't know what Yowie is, it's art that is, you explain it,

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.480
Dark Soccer. I can't. It's man-on-man action.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:34.640
It's basically, imagine like the uber sweet, sappy, you know, typical heterosexual relationship

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.160
and then change the gender of one of them to male.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:42.640
Okay. Good definition. But as I understand it, Yowie is not made for gay men. It's not

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.160
gay porn. It's not gay anime.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.840
It's made for straight girls.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:52.040
Yowie is made for girls. So, I get asked all the time because Yowie is man-on-man action

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:58.480
and you're going to YowieCon. And I say, okay, well, as a gay man, the last place I want

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:07.840
to be on the planet is a hotel full of horny straight women. I mean, really. So stop asking

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:14.080
me if I'm going to go to YowieCon because the answer is no.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.560
YowieCon maybe because I love my lesbians. I love my lesbians. I might go to YowieCon

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560
but I don't know about YowieCon.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.360
All right. Sorry. Sorry for the aside, Dark Soccer. I apologize for cutting into your

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.360
precious website of the week time. We needed to have some Yowie chat. Can we do your website

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360
of the week now?

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.360
Sure.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360
All right. Here we go.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360
Because I'm just playing with the stupid thing anyway.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.360
All right. Here we go.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:44.920
So, the website of the week is fallingsandgame.com which I have no idea what the purpose of this

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:50.480
game is for anyway. But it's really stupid. All I'm doing is just watching it do shit.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:58.720
Yeah, it's a game from the same people who do cat or was it cat with bow golf or something?

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.600
I don't know but I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing other than drawing lines and trying

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.840
to make this thing destroy my sand slides.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:10.920
It's that thing that's running around on the outside. You're supposed to hit it with sand.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.520
Is this like Yoshi's Touch and Go?

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.680
I've been hitting it with sand and it's not doing anything.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.840
Are you sure this game is fun?

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:23.720
Because it explodes. They have one that's also with slugs and you have to pour salt

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:24.720
on them.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:31.440
I hate slugs. I'm actually slug phobic people. You now know what my deepest fear is, slugs

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.440
and snails.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:37.640
I don't know. Because I keep pouring sand on it. I think it's the type of sand I'm using.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.760
Grow sand.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:46.200
I want the sea monkey the game. Or that I can flush them down the toilet.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.680
That's the only thing missing from Sims 2 Pets.

01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.680
Funerals?

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.680
No, flushing animals down the toilet.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.360
Funerals? Fish funerals? Remember when I had fish?

01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360
This is fantastic.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.000
I prefer to call them funerals.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.320
It's just like, what the hell is this crap?

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.680
Alright, give that URL one more time.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:12.000
FallingSandGame.com. I'm like, oil? What the hell is the oil thing? Oh, I see what it is.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.920
Dude, this is like the biggest ball of sand freakin' ever.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.240
FallingSand.com. That gets dark, sacra, steel, and thermal.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.240
Dude, fire!

01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.240
Alright.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.400
Dude, I just set the ball of sand on fire. That's great.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.400
Look at it.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.760
Can I move on? Are you finished?

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.760
No, this is great.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:31.800
What is up with you people tonight and not being able to finish in a reasonable amount

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:32.800
of time?

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.800
I am paying attention.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.040
I am playing with the sand game.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.360
Can I talk about BlizzCon while you're playing with the sand game?

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.360
Sure.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.280
Because I'm a little upset about this.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.400
As you know, I've been gone for the past two weeks, and during that time, tickets for BlizzCon

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.000
went on sale.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And I actually was going to go to BlizzCon this year, while I get home and find out that

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.280
the tickets went on sale June 13th, and then promptly sold out on June 15th.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.520
So tickets for BlizzCon 2007 already sold out.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.480
If you haven't heard, it's August 3rd and 4th at the Anaheim Convention Center.

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.720
And you know, if you go, you're supposed to get all this free stuff.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.000
I, however, will not be going, and I'm a little bit bitter about it.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I know...

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Are you going to cry?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
A little bit.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Actually, no, I'm not going to cry.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I'm going to get angsty.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:31.120
And you know what happens on the show when people get angsty?

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.680
FUs of the week time, Dark Soccer, start us off.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.480
I'm trying to get the information out of my purse, because I'm going to tell people exactly

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.760
where the fuck I went.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:42.520
Fuck you to the idiot at Quiznos.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.820
I wanted my sandwich.

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:54.360
I specifically wanted a Philly cheesesteak sandwich on whole wheat bread with no mayonnaise

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.280
and no sauce on it.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.640
Just meat and cheese and onions on wheat.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.640
And I didn't want it burned either.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.640
I want it toasted.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:08.660
So the guy's like, I'm like, okay, I want to go.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.320
Were you being served by Ozzy Osbourne?

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:13.600
No, I was being served by a moron.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.520
And so I was like, okay, dude, I want a Philly cheesesteak.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520
No mayonnaise.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.120
So he starts putting mayonnaise and I'm like, dude, I said no mayonnaise.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.440
And then he puts it in and I get it.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.440
There's like, okay, prime ribs.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.440
No, I said Philly cheesesteak.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.440
Oh, okay.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.440
I'll go add cheese.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.440
What?

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:36.360
And then he rings it up as a Philly, I was like, dude, okay, first of all, you bring

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.960
me up as a prime rib.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.960
It's a different price.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.960
He's like, oh, well, this is cheaper, so I'll just charge you for that.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.960
Whatever.

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960
So finally, I just ended up saying, where's your manager?

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.160
Oh, the manager's only here in the morning.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.160
Okay.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:55.840
So it's quiz nose number one, one, two, nine on, what is that road that's off of Zinfandel?

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:56.920
I don't know.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:57.920
Not white rock.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.920
Just call it off of Zinfandel.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.240
Zinfandel and 50.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:02.960
It's off of Zinfandel near 50.

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.960
Yeah.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.720
By the, across the street from Target and Cheezer's Pizza.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.720
Olson, it's Olson drive.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.720
Olson.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:09.720
I used to work on that road.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:10.720
Okay.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:15.520
It's Olson in Rancho, Cambodia.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.200
And the guy's name was, I can't pronounce it, but it's A-K-O-B.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.680
A-K-O-B.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.720
Don't never let this guy make you a sandwich because he'll burn it.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.560
You saw my sandwich, Rob.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.560
It was pretty burnt.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:35.140
It was, it was, I just came back from Philadelphia and you can't get cheesesteaks anywhere else

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.140
like you can there.

01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:37.920
There's a reason they are Philly cheesesteaks.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.920
I know.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.920
Everything else is suck.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.960
I have never had such idiotic service anywhere.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.720
And I'm like, I can understand, you know, missing it once, but the dude wasn't even

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.720
freaking listening to me.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:51.080
Anytime I said something, I was like, I want a small drink.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.560
He gives me a fucking large cup.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.120
I'm like, dude, small.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.680
Jamie, maybe he was high.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.560
No, he was, he didn't, I can tell him somebody's high.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.320
He was not red-eyed.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.920
He was not stealing the cheese out of the, the thing.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:10.640
He sounded, he just was speaking in a whisper and not listening.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:15.480
He was looking off in this face like, dude, I don't care how much you hate your job.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.840
You can at least do it right.

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.840
You know?

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:18.840
So whatever.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:19.840
All right.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.840
Thank you.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:26.880
A dark soccer for your very specific and directed eggs tonight, Loki, your F use of the week

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:35.760
goes to Christopher's desk for being rotted that is really foul.

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:42.280
Like I had to put a cup over the giant pile of rot.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.920
It's literally, there's like stuff growing.

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.600
I'm creating a wall with cans.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.600
I don't have enough yet.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:51.840
So I have to drink a couple more cans.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.120
Is that it?

01:21:54.120 --> 01:22:00.640
My F you of the week goes to myself and the target that's across the street from said

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:06.600
quiz knows because I was there and I was buying some diet soda.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.080
In fact, the IBC root beer I'm consuming right now that's mixed with Malibu.

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:14.560
I was buying that and as I was pulling it off the shelf, I, it got caught on the cream

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:15.920
soda next to it.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.080
And so all the IBC cream soda went all over the floor and there was breaking glass everywhere.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:23.520
It was, it made a beautiful noise, but F you to myself for being such a klutz.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.480
I told you fucking cream soda sucks.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.680
See now you know.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:28.680
All right.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:35.800
Uh, explicit and the F use tonight, um, uh, F used to having a flat tire during the road

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.280
while I was trying to go to my cousin's graduation and brought a lot of stuff.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:46.840
Luckily I came in, came into the party, um, rather than not being able to make it after

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:52.840
he goes to pretty much everybody keeps overrated the over 9,000 joke.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.240
What is the over 9,000 joke?

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.240
Dare I ask?

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.240
Okay.

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:01.600
If you go to YouTube or just type in over 9,000 up at Google.com.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.960
Is it a Dragon Ball Z thing?

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.960
Yeah.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.960
Okay.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960
I have seen it.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.960
Power level is over 9,000!

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960
DMN.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:13.920
DMN linked me to something or sent us a song or something and I wanted to poke him in the

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:14.920
eye with a fork.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:15.920
Yes.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:16.920
I know what you're talking about now.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:17.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.760
I hear that almost every freaking day.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:25.200
Um, let's see, an F goes to my co-workers for trying to make me break, um, New Year's

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.200
resolution.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.760
I'm not sure if you guys will know what the New Year's resolution might, gave up for the

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:30.760
whole year.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:32.760
Well, dare I ask what it is?

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.760
Not erections again, is it?

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:34.760
No, no, no.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:35.760
You gave up sex or masturbating?

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.760
Masturbation.

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.360
You gave up masturbating for a whole year?

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.360
Yeah.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:41.360
Oh my God.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.240
Are you having sex with women at least?

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.840
Uh, sadly no.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.160
Oh my God.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.160
You're gonna die.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.120
You should just get a hooker.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120
For real.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.680
Wow, you're, you're a brave man, that's all I have to say.

01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:04.160
Let's see, another F goes to everybody, I'm still talking about the 300 Sparta joke.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.960
Combined with a Chuck Norris.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:09.040
Hey, I got a shirt that says, this is Zelda.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040
That was actually funny.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.040
Yeah, I got that.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040
That was, that was a good times.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.080
F you to some of the kids in shotgun for asking me for money.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.760
Okay, if you, I don't know, I'm not sure how many, how many, how much money these kids

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:23.040
spend on a con.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:31.800
Especially with their like $110 swords and their $50 Naruto jacket, et cetera, et cetera,

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:32.800
et cetera.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.880
Oh God, we're gonna be starting on that.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.320
Let's see, and well, that's all for now.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.120
I always like how he always leaves it with, that's all for now.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:45.360
And then he'll be back like in a year.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.040
Here's some F use I've collected over the past year that I'd like to share with you

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.040
here.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.320
Actually, actually I found something.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.300
I found something just for you.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.300
This is just for you.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.300
Jonas

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:25.720
Isn't that one of the most God awful things you've ever heard that was made by DMN.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.800
Oh gee, didn't see that coming.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.320
I'll send you the MP3 later, Jonas.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:37.440
Anyhow, anyways, can we get back to games please?

01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:43.200
So something kind of cool came down to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace and once I saw

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:48.720
it, I thought, well, I don't know, I had to watch it, but I didn't, so.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:53.040
Basically the Xbox Live Marketplace, among other things, got a whole bunch of anime.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:58.880
So that's pretty awesome, including Guyver, Trinity Blood, Gunslinger Girl, Speedgrapher,

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:07.200
Basilik, Sayuki, Kitty Grade, Genku, I can't even, The Count of Monte Cristo, whatever.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.240
Desert Punk, Last Exile, Rumbling Hearts, Galaxy Railways, Gilgamesh, and Lupin the

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.120
Third Part 2.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:20.520
But it also got Akira, and Akira in HD, which is fucking awesome.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.320
So definitely worth checking out, especially if you're an anime fan, because that's one

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.700
of the best anime movies I think of all time.

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:32.160
And I believe Lady Death was also on there in HD, so that's something else.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.960
Then beyond all that, National Geographic shit.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:39.240
So yeah, National Geographic Adventure, and yeah.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:43.220
So, watch some Akira in HD.

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.160
Can I tell you a secret?

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.500
Most people assume that because I do this show, I watch a ton of anime, which is so

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:49.500
not true.

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.960
I've never seen Akira.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:51.960
Why?

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.160
I just haven't.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.080
The manga's better, don't watch the anime.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.240
No, no, no, no.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.840
The anime is fucking awesome, and you know what?

01:26:58.840 --> 01:26:59.840
I watched it.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.840
Well, I started a fight.

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.680
I remember going to this, you know, it was a place called Steamers or whatever, it was

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:10.520
a coffee shop slash video rental place.

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:15.360
It was like one of the mom and pop shops or something around in Elorado Hills.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.240
So I went one day, bored, and so I was like, I'm going to go rent something.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:25.280
So I went to the cartoon section, I don't know why, and I saw Akira, you know, rated

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.400
R, so I picked it up, and of course a car at that time.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:32.320
But it's fucking awesome, dude.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.960
It has, you know, full frontal, has people's limbs getting blown off, motorcycle chases.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:41.560
Oh, sorry, I heard full frontal and I woke up.

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.080
Space satellite lasers.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.080
It does have the bike, however, the cool thing about the manga is that the movie is like

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080
manga-lite.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:55.720
There's like, at least 30 chapters where Kaneda is not even anywhere, he just disappears.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.720
It's a fucking awesome movie.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.280
One of the main characters.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.120
It's got a character that looks like Louie Anderson.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.120
So you gotta...

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.120
That is true.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:08.040
You've got to watch it, and he kind of sounds like you, too.

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.960
I hate Louie Anderson, you're not selling me this.

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.960
And when he gets killed.

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960
And 50-year-old children.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.240
Can we please move on?

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.240
He's like old Louie Anderson.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.120
Can we finish part A tonight at some point?

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:20.120
And the clowns!

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.880
If old Louie Anderson, oh yeah, the clowns, if old Louie Anderson could like do, you know,

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.400
psychokinetic shit.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.680
That's fucking awesome.

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.640
Is this, has this show really lasted five years somehow?

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:32.640
Not yet!

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.640
We're not there yet.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:36.400
That's right, it could all end tonight, boys and girls.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.400
Crash!

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.400
We're getting close.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.680
Okay, can we talk about something else, Rob?

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.680
Sure.

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.680
Read the manga.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.160
Shut the fuck up and read a story.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.160
Okay.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.160
Well guess what?

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:53.720
You know that Castlevania film that was supposed to be done by Paul W.S. Anderson?

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:56.200
Well he said, fuck y'all.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.200
Not really.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.400
He said, I'm working on other projects.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.800
Like he's remaking Death Race.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800
And that is awesome.

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:05.800
Yeah, it's more priority over Castlevania.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.800
I agree.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.800
Yes.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.960
However, the one that they are getting to replace him is Sylvain White, who brought

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:20.920
us such classics as Stomp the Yard, and I'll always know what you did last summer.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.680
Such great American cinema classics.

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.120
He is quoted saying, most of the vampire films that have been present are set in the future

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:31.760
from Blade to Underworld, and I was attracted to the chance to make a dark, epic period

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.640
movie that almost had an anime feel to it.

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:37.720
Well there's Castlevania right the fuck there, so.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.320
Uh, Van Helsing?

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.320
Anybody?

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:42.720
Yeah, but that wasn't a good movie.

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.720
It just had Hugh Jackman being sexy, and that's it.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.040
But it had vampires in it, it was a period piece.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:49.440
But it was a bad movie.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.320
What about Bram Stoker's Dracula?

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.320
That was sexy!

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320
Oh my god.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.320
Anybody?

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.320
How about Interview with the Vampire?

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.120
That movie was so hot, I would make love to it if I could.

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.280
That was sort of multiple...

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.640
It was part period, part present, part...

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640
You don't understand that.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640
Part just, like, gay.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640
It's like...

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.640
It's a gay movie.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.640
It really is.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640
I just expected making out all over the place.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.640
For real.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:11.640
That was a good movie.

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.680
He probably just doesn't watch a lot of those classic films, you know, because he's in a

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:19.360
whole other, you know, decade now, so.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.920
Who watches any of that stuff?

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:31.800
Well, I have to say that maybe, maybe he's, he might have some, I mean, if he gets the

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.400
imagery off, then that'll be good, but you know what's also though interesting that he's

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.920
going to be directing is Ronin, Frank Miller.

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:46.520
As long as it's not Paul W.S. Anderson or Riebel, you know, we need someone else to

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.560
make fun of for making crappy movies.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:51.840
Everyone has to start off somewhere, right?

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:55.600
Well he did do I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.040
That's a springboard, I'll say.

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:02.160
I'm going to try to have some faith because you know me and my Castlevania, oh my god.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.840
I will withhold judgment until the film is done, that's only fair, right?

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.840
Right, Halo.

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840
Everybody deserves a chance.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.840
Right, Halo.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:09.840
What?

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:10.840
Halo.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.840
Halo.

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:13.600
You said yourself that you passed judgment on Halo.

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:14.600
I just.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:15.600
Have you learned your lesson, Rob?

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.600
I so got pwned just now.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.600
Have you learned your lesson?

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.360
No, I'll never learn my lesson.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.720
Haven't you learned that after five years?

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:29.680
I know, but I'm not going to tell, I'll always know where Jigglypuff is hiding last summer.

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:33.640
And now I think it's about time to say goodbye to part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.940
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back after a little break with more of

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:38.600
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:41.800
For those of you guys listening live here on Sunday night, you get part B just in a

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.240
few minutes, but for those of you guys listening to us on our audio archive or podcast feed,

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.600
you just have to wait a couple days.

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:49.400
We'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:54.920
We prefer to call it actually Orange Lounge Radio Championship Edition because it is technically

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:58.600
a brand new sequel to the original Orange Lounge Radio episode.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.160
Yeah, Loki, shut up.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:05.880
a week.

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:32.440
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
