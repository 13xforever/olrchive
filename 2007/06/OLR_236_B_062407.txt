Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this part B of episode number 236.
And this, of course, is our fifth year anniversary show.
That's right.
On June 23rd, 2002, we went live for the very first time with Orange Lounge Radio live episode number one, where some of the topics included... God, what were we talking about that week?
I don't even remember.
I think it was kind of more like an intro to the show.
We were talking about our experiences playing various...
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Orange Lounge Radio
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.
Oh, God.
I've never... No, you know, in fact, today I have a modification to that.
If you won't take care of your child, I will have someone kill you.
Because I'm not going to take care of your child.
Wow, I don't know about that.
I'll have you shot in the head.
Headshot for the win.
Press A. Some users in chat are commenting on the quality of that clip.
That's right.
When Orange Launch Radio started, we were on a dial-up friendly stream.
So the stream you could hear was usable on 56k modems.
Because five years ago, a lot of people still were on those.
By the way, do you still own the drive that you have that saved on?
if you can find it, I may have a way to extract it
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and apparently it's come down the wire that the doctors from the AMA have backed away from their decision they're now recommending that the American Psychiatric Association who kind of would be the final judge and jury in this anyway do a little more research quote there is nothing here to suggest that this is a complex psychological disease state akin to alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders and it doesn't get to have the word addiction attached to it
I don't think it's addiction.
I think it's OCD.
All right.
Well, anyhow, as we promised here in Part B, we have a pizza on the way.
We're just going to... Our bread and cheese to go with our wine.
We're going to just kind of kick back and relax, because as we've said a lot this evening, Orange Launch Radio is about you guys, and we get asked all the time.
Thank you for watching!
but funny enough we started while they were on hiatus because of G4 and everything and Scott working at G4 and now it's kind of funny that we work together but regardless of all that I just say that because I know we've gained a lot of listeners thanks to our partnership with All Games but just there wasn't a lot like us when we started at least that we knew about so it's kind of interesting because now that podcasting is so huge and essentially any idiot with a microphone can have a podcast which really any idiot with a microphone before could do an internet radio show it's just you know
Thanks for watching!
We have true live interaction.
We like to pretend we're sitting around at a big table with our listeners and just talking about the latest in gaming.
Sometimes we break stories, although we probably won't be breaking them too much more in the future, but we're not usually thought of as a source for breaking news.
There's plenty of other game blogs who are paid to bring you breaking news.
We don't get paid for this.
So that's kind of what distinguishes us from everybody else is the listeners, the chatters, the live interaction that we have.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hi guys, this is FootyMonster from Argentina.
Wow, I got the first call.
You did, you got the first call, FootyMonster.
Good for you.
What's on your mind?
Well, first of all, guys, I just wanted to say happy fifth birthday.
You've been with me at least for the last two years when I've actually found you guys right before you went into iTunes.
And it's been a great two years, dude.
I mean, it's amazing.
You've been there every Sunday, give or take.
And it's pretty cool to have that kind of your voice go with you all the time.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Because we don't always get to see that here.
Yeah, I called before about it once.
Yeah, I know.
I remember.
Basically, there's no official gaming market here.
So everything is a great market.
Like a 360 costs $700 and a PS3 costs $1,400.
Do you get a lot of gaming fans down there?
There is a lot.
I mean, here there's still an arcade scene, so to speak.
So we will see a lot of pumped-up DDR, maybe some guitar freaks, maybe, just maybe, because there's like a few machines.
But, like, you know, the King of Firescrout is still there, they go to the arcades, because those things are still affordable, so to speak.
Okay, I get that, that's cool.
And, I mean, here, the PS2 is still, like, full-blown, like, there's no next-gen here yet.
Like, because you can seriously go buy a backup of a PS2 game for five bucks.
You got any questions for us tonight or anything you wanted to say?
Because if you don't have anything for us, we'll grill you.
I mean, yeah, I actually have one question.
What do you have to say to, I mean, as you know, after iTunes and after all these gaming podcasts came out, many of us, of the listeners, actually started our own ventures into the thing.
Myself, I don't know if you guys remember, I have my own show, The Ultimate Quest.
It's an RPG exclusive show.
We just started that like a few months ago.
Good plug, good plug.
It's hard.
Yeah, I tried to mention it there.
But what do you say to us that actually are starting out?
What do you tell us?
Maybe a good advice or something that helps us keep at it when you're like life sucks and you don't want to edit the show that day and you just want to not do that thing that week.
What's your advice to all of us who are starting out?
I say the sooner you get it done, the sooner you don't have to do it again.
Get it out of the way out of spite.
I told you, everything I do practically is motivated by spite.
And porn.
Well, not so much the porn.
Life is things to go.
That's why my show kind of stopped twice.
Here's my advice, Footy Monster.
If you're doing the show, and I'm just saying this in general.
I'm not saying this at you, but in general to anybody who's thinking about starting a podcast or doing this.
If you are doing this program or if you're doing a program
to try and get more listeners than anyone else or try to get a listener count that's through the roof or to try and get a listener base that's the biggest one you've ever seen.
You're doing this for the wrong reasons.
You wouldn't even start if that was the reason.
Goodbye.
And there's no listeners.
You have to know, though, there are people out there that that is their sole motivation is attention.
And don't get me wrong.
Attention is lovely.
I mean, the attention whore side of me is what keeps me motivated for the past five years.
Attention can be bad sometimes.
Attention can be bad, as we learned a couple months ago.
But regardless, you've got to do this because, especially in these panel-based shows, you've got to really like the people that you're hanging out with.
You've really got to love the topic that you're talking about.
Or be able to fake it.
And I'm sure there's been those weeks where I've wanted to come in here and choke a bitch, namely Jamie.
Yeah.
I'm nice, Ron!
No, for real.
And I'm not saying that, you know, that's very rare that that kind of thing ever happens where like, you know, I'm like, oh, I'm mad at somebody tonight or I'm mad at the world and I'm going to take it out on Jamie tonight or Loki or whatever.
Oh, baby.
But it's like an opportunity for us to get together and just kind of like, this is kind of how I hang out with Jamie.
And these days, I used to live with Matt, but now this is how I hang out with him.
You know, it's kind of through this show.
Yeah, you never call, you never write.
That's not true.
What am I supposed to think?
That's not true.
Rob has left me.
To us listeners, it seems like you guys are hanging out like 24-7 because the chemistry that you guys have on air is just amazing.
It's like brothers and sisters.
You want to poke them in the eye just because you're annoyed at them.
And that's what it is.
Jamie's my gaming sister.
Matt's my gaming brother.
Poking in the eye.
I've never thought of that.
She has glasses, though.
I can't do that.
I have protective eyewear.
Roar.
Well, Footy Monster, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling in.
We appreciate it, okay?
All right, well, you guys keep it up, and happy fifth anniversary, and let's hope there's another five more.
Appreciate it.
And hey, quick question for you.
How long have you and the girl in your icon, who I believe was Canadian, how long have you two been together now?
I've been together three years and a half, and I'm actually going to see her in a month.
So, yeah, yay me.
Congrats, you two.
I just want to point out to Loki and Jamie, look at that cute little icon there.
They're kissing.
Ah, get a room.
Get a room.
I can't see through your big fat shoulder.
Sorry.
It keeps clicking away because other calls are dropping in.
Oh, that is cute.
All right.
There you go.
All right, guys.
Well, I'll let you guys go so you can take more calls.
All right.
We had to embarrass you on air, Footy.
My turn.
Take care, Footy.
All right.
Bye-bye.
See you all.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Do it for the love.
I do it for drugs.
Raven Stolfen
I have a bunch of love for this community and video gaming.
I really do.
I've been gaming since I was three.
Three!
Amen.
You got me beat.
I started when I was four or five, I think.
I don't remember.
How old were you when you started gaming, DarkSakura?
Do you really want to know?
Yeah.
I think I was three when the Odyssey 2 came out.
Ozzy 2, I believe, came out in 1979, which I turned 3 in 1970.
I know that dates me.
I turned 3 in 1979.
So, if that shows, that was my first gaming system.
Loki, what about you?
I played the ColecoVision.
So, I don't remember.
It's like round 4.
My mom was playing Pac-Man when she was pregnant with me.
Wow, so it runs in the family.
Or Pong, sorry.
It runs in the family.
And pinball.
Very cool.
Wow.
What was your first game, Raven's Dolphin?
Believe it or not, it was Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo.
Ah, you kids.
You were three when that came out?
I was three.
Oh my god.
Sorry.
I know, you just reminded me how old I am.
No, no worries, no worries.
It's all good.
I'm sorry I missed out to all the 8-bit action, but it's not my fault.
Smurfs and Bump and Jump.
Dude, I hella remember Smurfs and the Atari Smurfs.
Our game was Mousetrap.
And we had Turbo.
But we had a setup for Turbo.
We would grab a chair and a TV tray and put the driving wheel on top of it.
That was where my addiction to peripherals came.
And Donkey Kong Jr.
and Kongo Bongo.
Those are the other ones.
Good times.
Two more things for you, Rob.
Venture.
What was that?
Two more things, Rob.
All right.
What was it you didn't like about the show, out of curiosity?
I don't have puppies.
Oh, my Nintendogs!
Oh, the five seconds I played that game.
The Rob D in chat says Nintendog still sells a ton.
Go figure.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
With all the love in my heart, I love you now.
You know, you do these live shows all the time, and I'm starting to do live and failing at it a little bit.
But how do you not fail at it like you normally do?
You keep doing it.
We do fail at it, you just don't notice.
Okay, this is my opinion, and this is from doing my show in this too.
I think I'm fucking up every episode, okay, but after a while, you know, people are like, oh, that was fun, that was fun.
I'm like, it was?
And so you just keep doing it until enough people tell you that it's fine.
for me and this might be a weird thing to bring up but some people go to church every Sunday night and they make it a habit and they do it every single week and I'm not a religious person and really my religion is not the listeners business anyway but you know this in a way is kind of
I did.
I missed episode two.
You make a lot of shows.
But I'll tell you this.
I've been listening since you did the part A, part B thing.
Follow me.
Well, we really appreciate it, Raven Stauffen.
Oh, oh.
Yeah?
They want me to say this line.
Should I say it?
All right, go for it.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Okay.
It's an inside joke.
All right, thanks, Raven Stauffen.
We've got to let you go, buddy.
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah, we've got to keep each call to like five minutes.
It's Loki's turn.
We've got a lot of calls tonight.
All right, Loki, you get to answer this call.
Let's see.
Who am I going to let you answer?
How about this one?
Hey, who is this?
It's Airman.
It's a crank call.
Is somebody there?
Hello.
Frickin' crank calls.
All right, Loki, you don't get out of it that easy.
You get another call.
Here you go, Loki.
You get this call instead.
Ah!
Loki, you get this one.
I get three calls.
Hi, this is Orange Lunch Radio.
Who is this?
Hey, what's up, guys?
It's the Rob D. Hey, how's it going?
Not too shabby.
Gotta congratulate you on the 500th episode, obviously.
Well, thank you.
Well done.
What are the most disturbing trends you've seen in gaming, and what is the best trend you've seen in gaming?
I have an answer for this, but I'll let you guys go first, or if you want to think, I'll...
Most disturbing trends in gaming?
The baby stage of Parappa?
No, I haven't played that, so I don't know.
No, I would say probably the most disturbing trend in game is this, like, I don't know, focus on, I guess, a lot of the games seem to be repeating themselves.
Sequels.
Too many sequels, or even better, too many fucking spin-off games, like Square, let's see.
Perfect example, Final Fantasy VII should only be one game.
It's Final Fantasy VII.
We don't need Final Fantasy VII, A, B, C, D, E, so on.
That's annoying.
Also, this whole thing with violent video games and people targeting stuff, I don't think video games are that much more violent than they were years ago.
It's just the technology has gotten better.
The way that they're displayed is more graphic.
and more mainstream.
You've got people finally realizing that games aren't just for kids.
I attribute it to society getting wimpier.
I think that people are getting more coddled.
For example, when we were kids, who played tetherball and who had metal jungle gyms at school?
Yeah, we had that.
Now what are they?
Plastic and no tetherball.
What the hell?
Thank you for watching!
We were sort of raised in the, oh, well, kids got to take their bumps, right?
You're not going to learn not to fall off the swing set if you don't fall off the swing set once to find out that the ground is hard, you know?
And now parents are like, oh, we need to protect them from all this and blah, blah, blah.
Let's raise a society of wimpy asses.
You know what?
Part of being a child is learning.
Is learning.
That's it.
Is learning.
Part of being, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Wow, that was kind of deep.
I was going to say, my most disturbing trend is bad ports.
Ubisoft, Wii, end of case.
EA, first generation 360 games.
There you go.
Bad fucking ports is the most disturbing trend in gaming.
Most Wii games?
Best trend in gaming real quick, then we'll let Rob D. give his answers.
Best trend in gaming.
Best trend in gaming, I would say multiplayer and downloadable content.
I have to say bizarre indie games.
With the exception of Irritating Stick.
I'm going to give the big three each one, because I do like that the big three each have something going for them.
Nintendo, innovation and control style.
Say what you will about the Wii being a one-stop shop.
It's really turned a lot of people on to gaming who weren't there before, so yay Nintendo.
Microsoft, Xbox Live, king of online gaming, undisputed champion.
Sony, hard to say so far, but home...
looks very innovative as well and could be very cool.
So, depending on that, but certainly not the brown-eyed judgment, which also would be my runner-up for worst trend in gaming is cameras.
I mean, it's a brilliant idea, but nobody's used it well yet.
Nobody.
Rob D., what do you think?
Well, my best trend in gaming, I'm going to have to agree with Loki and Sky on this one, definitely.
Xbox Live and the rise of online gaming on consoles.
With the online community I've seen and taken part in and
and the Xbox 360.
It's a wonderful thing.
There's just no two ways about it.
I swear to God I'll be there for Hold'em eventually.
I'll hold you to that.
Worst trend in gaming?
I actually have to go the opposite route of DarkSakura because I really think that a lot of publishers are being pushed in a direction to squash some games that may or may not sell well or that people these analysts may think won't sell well.
And on the DS, there are more independent games and there are some companies more willing to take a chance.
But when you see these development costs rising and rising so much on these next-gen systems, a lot of games don't necessarily get to be released.
And it's a shame.
All right.
Well, there you have it.
So rising development costs.
Remember when games were made by one dude?
Some of those Atari 2600 games were made by one dude.
And now they're like multi-million dollar productions.
But they don't have to be.
I mean, they don't really have to be to be successful games.
That's the thing.
People, especially publishers and developers, are kind of under this impression that they need to really push the envelope as far as realism in games, and that's not necessarily the case.
I mean, you don't need to be realistic in order to be a good game.
BlackWolfInChat, excellent point Ultima was made by one dude now the original Ultima is for me not that incredible of a game but the trend that it started huge so anyway Remember Adventure on the 2600?
Made by one guy Isn't that phenomenal?
Isn't that phenomenal?
Adventure?
Think about how many hours you spend on a game like Adventure Just phenomenal RobD we gotta wrap it up and let some more people through but any last thoughts?
Not really.
That's all I got for you guys.
Thanks for taking my call, and I hope you guys go for another, well, five years if you want to, I should say that.
We'll try our best.
If you don't want to, then you've got to stop at that point.
And if you want to hear more of the Rob D, as you should, he's a great radio host.
You really do have a voice for radio, Rob D. It's amazing.
tdig.allgames.com.
Check it out.
Exactly.
Just stay in gaming.
When I'm done with pimping, enjoy the rest of your show.
All right.
Have a good one, Rob D. Appreciate it.
My turn to take a call.
Let's go.
I'm going to go to a telephone call and see how that one turns out.
Let's do this one.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Scott.
I mean, this is Yuri Lover.
Hi, Yuri Lover.
Hey, good.
How are you?
I'm good.
Hey, DarkSakura.
Hey, Loki.
I just want to say congrats on a big five.
All right?
Thank you.
You'll be starting kindergarten soon.
We were in preschool already, and now we're this many.
Now, Olar, did Uncle touch you in the no-no area at all?
Did they?
Did he?
No, but Loki's been kind of messing with my mind over the past couple years, so I guess there's that.
Talk about games for Christ's sake.
What do you want to say about games?
I was going to get to that.
I was going to get to some great gaming affairs.
Some great gaming affairs that I know of.
EA and Westwood, Maxis, and every other goddamn company bought out by EA.
Me and your mom last night.
Microsoft and Namco.
Apple and Nintendo.
And OR and GameTap.
Why you gotta cheat on me?
Why?
Why you gotta cheat on me with GameTap?
What do you think has been a great partnership and what do you think has been a bad partnership?
Does anybody want to try and answer this one?
EA and anybody?
Has it been a bad partnership?
I don't know.
Oh.
I think that's a bad partnership, yes.
I think they just ruined the Command & Conquer series.
Alright, why?
Oh, is it because they ruined Command & Conquer?
I think the He Who Shall Not Be Named and Law is a bad combination.
Lord Voldemort and the Study of Law?
No, He Who Shall Not Be Named.
No, not Voldemort!
Not Voldemort!
No!
Just... No, I'm not going to say it on air.
I would say a bad partnership...
was Nintendo and Sony.
Actually, no, that might have been a good partnership.
Oh my God, the PlayStation one on the net?
Yeah, the whole PlayStation one.
Oh, wow.
If you think about it, though, I mean, maybe not, because maybe that was actually a good partnership, because if that hadn't happened, maybe the PlayStation would have never come out.
So, and that way, you know, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 certainly have changed the face of gaming.
So maybe that was actually a good partnership.
So maybe that's not fair for me to say.
How about this?
Bad partnership.
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
What the fuck were you thinking of partnership?
Philips, CD-i, and Nintendo.
There you go.
Everybody can agree that was bad.
Or what was it that, no, it was the CD-i that was playing Sega CD games, wasn't it?
I can tell you one, I think, if it ever happened.
Sega and Microsoft with the original Xbox.
How there were rumors going around that the Dreamcast was going to be on the Xbox, or the Dreamcast games were going to be playable.
Some of them made it, well, in different ways.
I would have loved to have like guitar here or popping music on my Xbox or something I would say a good partnership has been Square and Enix I think a lot of people had a lot to fear from that merger but you know the momentum hasn't really stopped and there's been a lot of really good games that have come out of those companies Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest VIII you know we still see a lot of good stuff granted Loki's problem with sequels they do have that problem the laser active that's what it was sorry
Bad Partnerships, so far at least.
Konami and Hudson, actually.
Because to be honest, Hudson, everything from that division has really sucked lately.
Bomberman, you know, Act Zero.
That game doesn't exist in my universe.
You know, I don't know.
Hudson, I mean, they've got some good things going for them, but I know they love Bomberman.
Okay, great.
But let's get past Bomberman.
Let that series...
Take a rest for a few years, you know.
You don't need to release a new Bomberman title every fucking year.
Well, the Xbox Live Arcade one looks pretty good.
I'll let him have that.
Well, hey, how about positivity?
What about the good partnerships?
Square Enix!
Well, yeah.
I actually was going to say, this is an old one, but Bleem and Sega.
Even though Sega didn't really have any authority over it.
Bleemcast.
Good times.
You got playing the PlayStation games on the Dreamcast?
It was only certain ones, but keep in mind, I am the biggest Tekken fangirl ever, and Tekken 3 on Bleemcast was better than the arcade.
It was beautiful.
I was like, hell yeah, take me now.
All right, Yuri Lever, what about you?
Anything you want to add to this?
Not really, but I just want to say congrats again.
My parents are sort of getting pissed off right now because I'm talking on the phone to total strangers, is what they think.
They don't get much stranger than Rob.
All right.
Well, we're sorry, Mom, and we're sorry, Dad.
And, yeah, so we'll have a good one.
We'll hang out.
Oh, don't worry.
It's my dad's birthday.
He'll just get pissed off tomorrow.
Well, he's got a good birthday then.
Happy birthday.
All right.
Yeah.
All right.
We'll see you later, you're a lover.
One more thing.
Do your parents know you're a yearly lover?
They don't know what it means.
Oh, I get it.
Okay, never mind then.
One more thing, yes.
It just means that you like snow.
No, not snow.
You like lilies.
Let him have his one more thing, yes.
ResTrans Vibrator.
Best peripheral ever, ResTrans Vibrator.
Yeah, it is.
Until 3Feel comes out, yes.
All through.
All right.
See you later, Yuri Lever.
Thanks for the call.
Have a good one.
Hey, Rob, before we take a call, I have to tell you about something that someone reminded me of in the chat room.
What's that?
Dan found a YouTube video of someone using the Mugen emulator to put the R-Type ship into Super Mario Bros.,
and played through the first level of Super Mario Bros.
with the ship from R-Type.
That's awesome.
Anyway, I'm going to answer this one.
Let's do some more calls.
Are you going to do email bag tonight?
Yeah, I am, but I need to answer this.
Let's do some more calls.
All right, we'll let you take a call here.
What?
Hi.
Hi.
I fear the Jamie.
This is Junami.
I know.
Hi.
How are you?
You don't sound like yourself.
Maybe because you screamed in his ear.
I don't know.
Yeah, I think that was it.
What do you want?
I'm just saying hi and happy fucking birthday.
Yeah, we're going to Sack Anime, right?
Yeah, we are.
When is that again?
That is middle of July.
I believe it's July 14th and 15th.
We are so there.
On SackAnime.com.
You're going to cosplay with me, right?
Uh, I might if I can, uh... Nerds!
Fucking nerds!
Rob, you know what?
Ah!
Did we ever get a panel on that?
I don't know.
Explicit was looking into it for us.
To do a panel at SAK Anime.
So what do you want?
Somewhere in the basement of the Scottish Rite.
You've got to have a topic.
I'll give you a topic.
Gothic architecture is neither gothic nor architecture.
Discuss.
I don't have any arches.
I have flat feet.
Drew, you've been a long time listener of Orange Lounge Radio.
Best thing that ever happened on this program?
I'd have to say episode 69.
I feel bad because Jamie wasn't there for that.
Is that the weekend I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room?
Why do you think it was the best moment?
What?
Did you hear what Drew said?
He said, why do you think it was the best one?
I know where you live.
Yes, you do.
Maybe you could give me a ride home.
Okay, here's the story behind episode 69.
Jamie was gone for a week and our friend Janae came on the program.
And Janae was having fun with it because she thought... The mistress.
She thought it was a phone sex line.
So, and the fact that it was episode number 69 didn't help any.
So it was episode 69, and that's when Karaoke Revolution, the very first one, was brand new.
And back in the day, we used to fuck off so bad on the program.
Like, we didn't have these set topics.
I mean, every program was kind of like tonight, in a way.
It was the three-hour tour.
Exactly.
And it's so weird how we've become organized since then.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, we're organized?
Yeah.
and someone.
When did this come about?
Karaoke Revolution got broken out.
Loki gave his most infamous performance that in some ways has scared him off from ever doing karaoke again.
So I ask Loki, is episode 69 to blame for your fear of karaoke?
I just hate karaoke and I don't know why I did it.
You made me do it last time.
Karaoke hates you.
I told him he was kicked out of the apartment if you wouldn't do karaoke or something.
I don't remember what it was.
I did it twice.
We're going to pick the song at random.
Great.
And then of course he changed the lyrics to I'm coming out to I'm staying in.
I like the pussy or something like that.
It was so freaking funny.
We were peeing ourselves laughing.
I'm sure there's a bootleg clip floating around somewhere.
That's what I need to send to Scott for the all-game soundboard.
I've got the MP3s.
Do you?
But I'm not sharing.
All right, Drew.
We had milkshakes.
and I believe that was the episode that Milkshake won the cage match.
I gotta run for just a minute because the food's here.
Matt, please take over, Jamie.
Food!
I know, God.
I could really use some pizza right now.
I've got pizza.
I don't get any pizza because I'm on the floor.
Ha ha!
Floor for you.
No pizza.
Wait, it was Loki on the floor that time.
Dude, okay.
I think that we should have the official Orange Lounge Radio barbecue.
Yeah, good idea.
Glad I thought of it.
I am not high.
No, you're drunk.
Damn, I am not high.
I'm just me.
You're drunk.
Okay, fine, I'm drunk.
You got me.
Just because I have corrupted you.
I have good beer this time.
What do you have?
Tell me what you're drinking.
I have Arrogant Bastard IPA.
Not bad, however, I can do you better.
I've got Guinness in the fridge at home.
And I'm never buying cheap champagne again.
Oh my god, this stuff went right to my head.
Should I mail you some waffles?
No, dammit, I don't need waffles.
Waffles, waffles.
I paid you back your waffles, didn't I?
Yeah, a long time ago.
Okay, I forgot.
Rob needs to bring us our pizza!
Waffles.
Dude, I could actually go for waffles instead.
I could go for pancakes right now, okay?
So, okay, tell us something relevant.
Like, talk about what do you think in the past five years of our show you think the best game released has been?
The most innovative game of the year type game.
Katamari Damacy.
Why do you feel this way?
No contest.
Food!
Oh my god, food.
Okay, I'm not talking to you anymore.
There's food here.
I see how it is.
I see where your priorities are.
Watch it be the wrong pizza.
Hey, they give you coupons.
They never give me coupons.
I know.
I'm special.
Now everyone is on the floor for pizza that reminds me of number 29.
All right.
Drew, we got to let you go because we have a bunch of other calls coming in.
All right.
All right.
Take care.
Oh, no.
Vagina puppies.
Shut up.
Bye.
Objection.
What a nerd.
All right.
Who's answering this call?
Loki, it's your turn, right?
Yes.
All right.
Then answer this one.
This one.
Hello, Vacuum Cleaner, how's it going?
Holy shit, what's that?
I don't want to know.
That was not good.
I don't want to know what they're doing.
Whoever just called us, please give us a call back a little later.
When you've called, Echo123 is what you want to call to always make sure that your internet connection is working.
And cleaned up.
You don't sound like Vacuum Cleaner.
No problem, it happens, dude.
No problem.
All right, Loki, how about you try this one instead?
Okay.
Okay.
Hello, who is this?
Hello, this is Insanus reporting live from Duck Island.
Duck Island?
How's it going?
It's going well.
Congratulations on five years, guys.
Thank you.
I'm going to celebrate by taking pizza.
What the crap is Duck Island?
You don't remember that?
No.
Okay.
Okay.
Remember the show where I was absolutely on a drunken rampage in the chat room?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, now I remember.
I do.
And a certain individual, who will not be named Rob, asked if I've ever been to Duck Island.
And I responded with, your mom goes to Duck Island.
And Rob laughed like a silly little girl.
Yeah, I know.
I do that sometimes.
All right, what do you want to talk to us about?
Well, you guys were talking about good ideas like with companies merging or working together.
You guys missed a really obvious one, Harmonix and Red Octane with the whole Guitar Hero thing.
I mean, honestly, that's probably been one of the biggest game franchises in the past two years.
You're getting a little quieter.
Put your mouth closer to the microphone.
But yes, dude, you're right.
It's really been kind of one of the first partnerships to give Konami a run for its money too.
And you know what?
Competition in some ways is a good thing, honestly.
Is this better?
Yes, much better.
Okay.
I was just calling to say congratulations on five years.
Here's to five more.
I hope my show lasts five months.
Well, how long has your show been going?
Now, you're starting this new show, right?
It's on.
It's going to be episode four this week.
Good job.
And what do you talk about on your show?
We talk about absolutely nothing, so it's pretty much like your show was back in the day, I would take it.
Good times.
I'm glad somebody's picking up the slack.
Yeah, I have to because, you know, I'm the big retarded kid of Orange Lounge Radio.
All right.
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
Not anything that would get me fired.
All right.
Good times.
Alright, I love you guys.
I love you too, DMN.
Don't get too drunk.
We'll try.
Alright, later.
Alright, have a good one, DMN.
Speaking of, DMN brings up a good point I want to ask you guys about really quick.
What do you think have been some of the best guests we've ever had on Orange Lounge Radio?
Because, you know, DMN was here once.
We've had a lot of people in and out of this house.
What do you guys think were some of the best guests we've ever had on the program?
Abe Lincoln.
Me.
Me.
and my ego.
My favorite guest ever has been Sauce.
And the lesbians.
I think the lesbians have been some of the best guests we've ever had.
Sauce is the best guest.
We have a lot of good women that come on the show.
Nothing against the men.
I'd have to say the top three have been Tiara and Kristen and Megzi.
Awesome times.
Hey, this is Scott.
How are you guys doing?
Congratulations on five years.
This is Scott from All Games?
Well, you know, I've been listening to the show, and I've been hearing a lot of people who seem to just be calling in to wishing you congratulations just to plug their podcast.
I don't really want to mention where I'm from.
I just want to make this about you.
Every call, it's like, hey, I do a podcast.
Hey, I want to give a shout-out on my podcast.
You know what?
This is about you three and this show, and it doesn't matter what I do or where I come from, okay?
I appreciate that, but isn't it funny?
Hey, there's the best guest on our show right there.
I only got two letters from attorneys after that appearance so apparently Orange Lounge Radio not only feeds information about games not released but it feeds information to legal counsel over at G4 I would know nothing about that sir
Well, I'm asking you because we're just kind of talking about, you know, random stuff in gaming and kind of the gaming scene is that, you know, you kind of bring up a good point that everybody and their brother and sister have a podcast in this day and age.
Because you're right, a lot of people have been calling in and plugging their stuff, which is fine.
We're all about promoting the indie podcast and I know you guys at All Games are really big on that.
But what do you think can really help a podcast kind of like distinguish itself amongst all the rest out there?
I mean, do something that no one else is doing and usually that'll work when you're doing something that you're passionate about.
I think you guys hit it on the head when you started out being about Benami because that was what you were passionate about but as you got more comfortable doing your shows, you kind of showed everyone that, hey, not only are we passionate about that but we're passionate about a lot of other things and that's how you kind of expand your show and you get to talk about more varied things but I think to start out,
You've got to start out with something that you're passionate about and something that no one else is talking about.
If you happen to be into the same stuff that everybody else is into, you can still do it, but try and come at it from a different angle.
Do something different with it.
Right.
Go ahead.
Well, I had a couple of toasts I wanted to give to you guys.
I don't know if you want me to wait for that?
No, go for it.
I've got my champagne glass in my hand.
Go for it.
I drank all my booze already, so here's some Coke.
All right.
What's the toast?
Okay, do a line up of guys back if you're doing Coke.
Okay.
Being a podcaster, I know that you guys, just like we, don't always get respect from people in the industry, so this first toast addresses that.
Here's to the game developers we love.
Here's to the game developers who love us.
The developers we love will never love us, so fuck those developers, and here's to us.
All right, good call.
I like that one.
That is great.
Okay, and then I have a little haiku, because I know how much you love haikus.
I do love haikus.
Okay, here we go.
And I hope I don't screw this up, because usually Sky corrects my... It's 575, Sky, 575.
Yeah.
Loki, Jamie, Sky, A Sunday Night Tradition, Lesbians Are Hot.
I'll drink to that.
Lesbians are indeed hot.
I might be gay, but I love my lesbians.
I'll save my last one for right before I hang up.
Is there anything else you wanted to...
Ask me or can I just give you guys some more love?
I do.
Well, really, really quick.
I just want to ask you a question because I know a lot of folks kind of know you as that guy that was on G4 a long time ago and all that stuff.
But I kind of rely on that experience that you've had kind of at the far end of this industry, kind of like where gaming media can go, kind of like all the way to the top, so to speak.
I kind of ask, is it possible that gaming can ever –
substantiate that type of media again?
Will we ever have a true gaming channel in the future, in the next five years, do you think?
I think the problem is that it's going to be difficult for anyone to sustain a channel.
It doesn't matter if it's games or anything else.
I mean, if you look at what's happening now as everything moves to the Internet, IPTV and broadband and Fios, and if you look at game trailers and IGN and GameSpot, they're essentially networks.
about games.
They're just done in a way that this, I think, audience wants to consume it.
The problem with a regular television channel is that people aren't watching regular television anymore, especially gamers.
They're getting all their content online.
They're getting it when they want it, how they want it.
And the model for reaching that audience just may not be the traditional cable TV model.
If you notice what's
Spike TV and what G4 has done is they're casting their net to this wider demographic because I think that once you try to just get gamers on a TV level, there's a belief, not necessarily that it's true, but there's a belief by both the ad community and the executives in television that that group, the gamer group, isn't big enough.
You know and I know there's 150 million Americans, there's 800 million Americans,
and gamers around the world.
But I think when someone doesn't understand games and they don't know games and they don't play games, it's difficult for them to believe that the audience is there and that it's big enough to support a big television network.
I think the way it's going to happen is it's going to be online.
I don't think we'll ever see a traditional television network that's ad-supported doing it because I just don't think that
within the age of 500 channels that there's enough.
Now, subscription, maybe, like Gameplay HD and VOOM, I believe that if they're committed to keeping that channel of subscription as part of an overall, not an individual subscription, but an overall HD package, that channel should succeed because, again, it's not reliant on viewers and rating.
It's reliant on the overall company, Rainbow Media and VOOM,
and being committed to niche programming on HD satellites.
So I think Gameplay HD is the best chance for a major network.
It just actually got picked up by Cablevision.
So I don't have different networks.
Cablevision is now carrying it as well.
Very good.
So it's Gameplay HD or it's YouTube for the rest of us?
Pretty much.
All right.
Anything else you wanted to share with us?
There's always all games because, you know, today audio, tomorrow video.
We're working on getting our own location.
and we'll be doing video every day as soon as we get that place up and running and of course I'm very excited for the day that you guys all come down to our place and christen the new location because
as the ashes of Arena fall, so will a new event rise in the heart of Hollywood with all games.
It's funny seeing a station like that, not so dedicated to games, still getting invited to E3.
I'm sure Scott's sick of hearing about G4.
It's not even about them getting invited.
It's about them spending money to try and appease the few gaming audience members they have left.
They basically siphoned off all the money they were spending on games.
They got it down to X-Play and a little bit of Attack of the Show and a Cinematek rip-off thing.
but really it's not about E3 letting them in it's about G4 trying to keep those gamers because let's face it I know you know it the majority of people that still watch G4 even though it's a very small slice of people in the world of cable it's still the gamers nobody is showing up for cops and cheaters and all that crap I don't know I show up for cheaters it's all about the few remaining gamers who are holding out that maybe someday there will be a resurgence but
It's not going to happen.
Their E3 coverage will probably be okay because they'll have Jeff Keighley and Adam and Morgan, but that's about it.
And then lots of women in bikinis.
There it is, because that's what gamers really want.
That's what gamers and 12-year-old boys really want.
Scott, we've got to get to some more calls.
We really appreciate you calling in and everything that you do with AllGames.com and supporting the independent broadcast.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
I want to say that like you guys have already laid out for people, this is not about a money making thing.
It's not about trying to be the leader in podcasting because let's face it, it's a very fragmented industry and it's difficult to stand out.
The only thing that can allow you to stand out in podcasting is your passion.
and when your passion shines through to the audience they will show up, they will reward you not with money and riches but they will reward you with the audience which is, you know, your words only work if people are there to hear them and whether it's 15 or 500 there are clearly people that love Orange Lounge Radio and they're the fuel that keep it running and it's really, it's an inspiration not only to the people that are trying to do podcasting
Right now, but to people like me Because, you know, you are the spirit of why I started doing it in the first place And so I close with this You know, Scott, you're very opinionated All three of you all have your own opinions about gaming So I love having you on our show And I love being on your show to debate So I close with this Here's to you and here's to me Podcast friends will always be But shall we ever disagree Then fuck you all and here's to me
Happy anniversary, guys.
Very well said.
Thank you so much, Scott.
Take care, buddy.
We always enjoy having Scott on the program.
He's good stuff.
That was great.
You never know who you're going to hear from here on the call-ins.
See, I really wish we lived closer to them.
I know.
It's a six-hour drive to get down there, but we're going to go.
I've heard rumblings about what they've got planned.
It sounds pretty exciting.
I'm pretty excited.
More calls?
I'm still trying to work to go to E for All.
Why not?
Or E for E. Or, you know, I could do something.
Jamie, how about one more call?
Then you can.
So take this call, Jamie.
Hi.
Whoever you are.
Hey.
What?
Dude, the Hulk is calling.
Hello?
What?
Hello?
Hey, it's Satan.
Cool.
Well, hi, Satan.
Hey, boss.
What's on your mind, Satan?
Guess what?
What?
What?
Your five years are up.
Your soul is mine now, bitches.
I had a full refund, sorry.
You know, you signed the contract.
Your soul is mine.
You'll have to talk to your secretary about that one, because, you know, that Judas does not know how to keep his paperwork straight.
Okay, don't give me any of this Enron legalese bullshit.
Your signature is on paper.
It's in blood.
Didn't you read the small print?
I have an addendum to that that's also signed in blood.
Well, Loki, new job, my right-hand man.
I need somebody with attitude and balls who doesn't give a shit.
Good job, Loki.
Yeah, but you saw the way that Namco made him cry like a little bitch.
I mean, do you really want someone like that working for you?
Now with the power of the almighty evil that is me behind him, nothing will stand in his way.
Not even a big ball of Katamari.
All right, we got you.
Answer you, Jamie.
Yes?
You will be forced to watch the series finale of SG-1 over and over and over again.
because ain't you to me, get blue balls.
There's always a start for something.
And Rob.
My dear, dear Rob.
Guess what?
Pineapple up the ass for you, bitch.
No, it's just the money I can make on pay-per-view by showing somebody sticking a pineapple up your ass.
I will rake it in.
Hey, that's my job.
I am here to lower the moral values of all programs I come in contact with.
Well, all I have to say is thank God for custom-made earplugs.
That's kind of messed up, Satan.
I mean, isn't there anything on the show you enjoy?
The pain, the pain, the pain.
This whole thing is having more fun bouncing off the walls of her cell than anybody listening to you.
You're a real jerk, Satan, and I'm about to hang up on you.
Oh, come on.
You love me.
That's why you signed the damn contract.
But you promised me Dunkin' Donuts.
Anything else, Satan, that you want to add tonight?
Let me think.
Satan, you're a real asshole, you know that?
Oh, he hung up.
Satan hung up.
Satan, you're a pig fucker.
Let's go to another call.
That was brilliant.
Loki, this one's yours.
Hello.
Who is this?
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
How's it going?
Hello?
God damn, do you know how many edits I'm going to have to do on tonight's show?
Because people can't get their phones to work or whatever it is.
That's alright, we forgive you.
Let's go to another call instead.
Loki, this one's yours.
Hello, who is this?
Hello?
Hello?
Legend of Zaku.
How's it going, Zaku?
Oh, pretty good.
Where's Scott?
Where's Scott?
Scott?
Sky or Scott?
Scott hung up a while ago.
Sky's right here with a mouthful of pizza.
No, Rob.
No, hi.
What's up?
Just congratulating you on five years, that's all.
Well, don't just congratulate me.
I didn't do that by myself.
Yeah, and everyone else.
The whole ORLR gang, pretty much.
Yeah, I'm just trying to wrestle, trying to get this broken monitor to work.
But yeah, a lot of things have been going on, like that whole Manhunt 2 thing, which I don't even know why.
It's just that Rockstar is kind of like, I kind of feel like they're actually pushing it too far.
I mean, I don't know.
I mean, I'm all for violence and everything, but I mean... I'm really for violence.
Yeah, you have to draw a line somewhere.
You can't go... You can't be that... You can't be too violent.
Yeah, but if I want to... I mean, this country was founded on freedom of speech and freedom of expression and freedom of... If I want to do it, shouldn't I be able to do it?
Yeah, but you also have to understand, you can do it, but...
You're going to have to face, you know, whatever reaction comes back.
That's basically you have to face the consequence of your own actions.
And that consequences people thinking you're badass.
Like if you call somebody a racial slur, even though you have the free speech to do it, that's not going to stop you from getting your ass kicked.
Yes, but that's different because that's when you are inflicting that upon someone else unwillingly and you're violating their rights.
I think it's more the difference between having the legal freedom to do something and having the moral freedom to do something.
Yeah, I guess...
Yeah, I guess it's kind of both are intertwined.
Basically, even though they have the legal right to do it, it's just, you know, obviously Nintendo or Sony or no other carrier might even pick that one up.
Maybe on PC after the whole Del Sol only thing.
But yeah, I mean, Rockstar really has to really learn how to, I don't know, just try to be violent, but
Even though you have to maintain a level of... I can't find the right word to finish it off with.
Decency.
Dude, can't we all just get along?
Can't we just kind of sit around and have some munchies and some Doritos?
But yeah, the important thing is that even though I got adult only, once it's toned down, this shit will sell crazy.
I'll tell you that.
Zach, you've been a long time listener of the show.
I know you've been listening ever since our Bomani days when we were exclusively talking about DDR.
What do you think has been the biggest story in the Bomani world that we've ever covered?
I'm not sure.
Maybe the... Hold on, let me... The whole... The whole Supernova thing...
You've managed to get first dibs on it in this country.
Did I hear like some water boiling or some bubbles blowing in the background there?
No, anyway, yeah, definitely Supernova coming back after such a long absence of DDR Extreme.
And then there was nothing.
And then finally for Supernova to come back kind of really reinvigorated us all.
And of course, Loki will be the first to tell you that he was one of the first five people in America to play it.
Right, right.
Saw you up there that day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah, five years is a long time for everything to change.
You know, people coming and going, certain things changing, losing a lot, you know, we lost a lot of people.
Remember Captain Jack?
Bless his soul.
Bless his soul, that's right.
We've been doing this show for five years for Captain Jack.
Yes.
All right, well, Zaku, any other last thoughts for our listeners before we move on?
That's pretty much it.
All right.
Have a good one and smoke one for us, buddy.
I don't smoke.
I know.
I'm giving you a hard time.
Of course you don't.
How dare I insinuate that?
All right.
Have a good one, buddy.
I love Zaku.
Actually, I've met him.
He's a good kid in real life.
We give him a hard time on this show sometimes.
That's because we do that to our listeners who've called in a bunch.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lines.
Oh, we're supposed to get to your segment, huh, Jamie?
I'm sorry.
I promise.
I have to answer the one call I've been telling you to.
Okay.
We'll get a couple.
Here we go.
Hi, Orange Lines Radio.
Who's this?
Hello?
Hello?
It's nobody.
Uh-oh.
Someone having microphone troubles.
Okay, your five years are up.
Where's the Chromehounds?
Oh, haha, Chromehound, haha.
Yeah, whatever happened to that big Chromehounds match we were supposed to have?
Who is this?
Well, we found out that the game sucked, and then I stopped playing.
Identify yourself, caller, for those that may not know.
This is, I'm Bobby.
Hi, Bobby.
Hi, Bobby.
and I'm not going to say where I'm from because it's about you.
I appreciate that, Bobby.
You can say where you're from, we don't care.
Back east.
So, yeah, whatever happened to the Chromehounds match?
You just, you know, Chromehounds sucks or what?
It was just a horrible game.
I had already sold it back.
I don't know, we couldn't get enough people.
He was running from me.
Running?
Those things can't even run.
They just slowly move away.
You were slowly waddling away from me.
Bobby, as I understand it, you're Loki's only friend on PlayStation 3.
No, he was my only friend, and now I have like seven.
Oh, well, I see.
You haven't added me, have you?
You're cheating on Bobby.
No, because I don't play my PlayStation 3.
Have you guys ever actually played a game together on PlayStation 3?
No.
That's sad.
Have you guys ever played a game together on Xbox?
No, I don't think so.
No, we played Texas Hold'em one time, I think.
Yeah, I remember that.
Well, gosh, Bobby, I know you've been podcasting a long time, too, and doing your thing.
What do you think?
Five years is a long time.
A lot of stuff's happened in the game industry.
What do you think has been a real big, important news story in the world of gaming that we should take a moment to reflect on at this, our five-year mark?
It's changed the gaming world.
I believe that the final rise of rhythm games in the U.S., something that I've been really wanting for a long time because I was a big fan of Bimani games back in college and all that stuff, and finally being able to buy them legitimately for my local game system is really something that I really think is a big deal to me at least.
So, like, how tons of us had to import that shit for years, and now we can just, you know, kind of get a lot of that stuff stateside.
Yeah, and I mean, you know, I mean, that was actually one of the things I wanted to call in to see if you guys had seen about Rock Band via a, you know, Kotaku posts a scan of a magazine that shows the drum peripheral for Rock Band.
Yeah, I have that magazine.
It's the drum peripheral, though, it's a concept drum.
It's the artist's rendition.
Yeah.
Which is, like,
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
It's basically beat the pad instead of necessarily actual drums.
Because you actually play drums, correct?
Yes.
So this is a subject near and dear to your heart.
Right.
I want a good drum peripheral for the home game, which I didn't think that Drum Mania for the consoles had.
I like the arcade version of Drum Mania.
That was actually a Yamaha drum set that I actually considered buying myself, getting the Yamaha DT Express 3.
It will work with it, too.
It gives you instructions in the manual how to set it up.
Yeah, but I bought a Roland one anyway, but I think Rock Band, they were saying that they would actually work with all electronic drum sets that use MIDI and stuff, so I won't have to worry about using this controller, but I feel bad for anybody else who does.
I still don't know.
The jury's still out on Rock Band for me.
I want to see a little more about it.
The concept sounds cool, but I'm kind of a little bit leery of spending all this money on it.
To be honest, it looks a little too similar to Guitar Hero 3.
I mean,
Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 2 Guitar Hero 3
I think Rock Band is actually building on the Guitar Hero code base a little bit.
Very interesting.
I want to ask you real quick, because I know you're a fan of Beat Mania, as you've claimed is one of your favorite games of all time.
You kind of had me thinking about the whole Japanese-US thing.
You really can't get a game like Beat Mania here in the US like you can in Japan, though, right?
So to some need, there's still a big need to import.
Yeah, well, I mean, all the good songs are on 2DX that you have to import.
I'm still importing those because I'm sorry the Britney Spears one on the US Beatmania doesn't cover it.
But I do like the US controller for Beatmania more than the Japanese home controller.
They did fix that.
They sure did.
Real quick comment in chat that I think is interesting.
I apologize, chat room.
We haven't been ignoring you.
We've just been focusing so much on the callers.
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Super hardcore Bomani fans refuse to give Rock Band a chance and are already judging it.
What do you think about those people that are judging the game?
Do they do that just because, I don't know, they're ignorant?
Or do they do that because Guitar Hero was disappointing to them?
I'm sad because I think that if Konami really took a risk and released Guitar Freak's Drum Mania over here and then later on with Karaoke Revolution we could already have something like this and they could be dominating the market.
But instead they have focus on other places.
Konami's problem was that they insisted on keeping all the J-rock and the J-pop and all that stuff which is great for that segment and great for their current fans but to get the rest of the audience they needed to put in songs that people here recognized and they never did that even when hip-hop mania was tested in arcades it was still all the J-pop and all that stuff so that's where Harmonix picked it up and said hey let's do this and they put in songs people recognized and it became a big hit
That's true.
That's kind of one thing we've kind of said a lot on this show that Guitar Hero has a lot to thank for its success is the fact that they made the song list a lot smarter and they were able to take a little more risks on it whereas Konami was always playing it safe and felt that the game would sell itself which is the engine.
Well they didn't know how they would market a guitar game over here.
That was their exact, well my sales rep's opinion on it.
They didn't know how they would be able to market it over here which is like dumb but
People look at it and then play it.
A lot of Guitar Hero marketing is because Best Buy has it set up and people just walk up and try to play it.
That's most of their marketing and a lot of people have bought it because of that.
Very similar to the Wii, I would say.
You kind of see somebody playing it and then you're like, wow, I want to try that.
That's kind of different.
Bobby, we've got to get some more calls and move on, but anything else you want to share with our listeners?
No, it's just congrats on the five years.
I know how hard the first hundred was for me.
And I do want to just share this, and I promise it will only be about a minute long, is that I was scared to email the mailbag about two years ago when it was still the to-go edition and stuff.
And I remember it took me a couple weeks to get the courage to even email Jamie asking about...
High Definition Television Lag Fearing Her Wrath Beatmania I think I was nice, wasn't I?
She's nice to most of our emailers.
You were, but it was just kind of like, oh, these are the guys I've been listening to for so long because I had heard of you guys and I had listened before the podcast came around and stuff and it was kind of like the whole celebrity, oh, I don't know if I want to bother them and stuff like that.
But you guys did inspire me to do what I do and I know you've inspired a lot of other people.
and thank you for that.
That is truly the ultimate compliment.
Compliments don't get much bigger than that, honestly.
Thank you.
It's amazing.
Thank you so much, Bobby.
We look forward to at least another 100 episodes from you and working with you to help make those a success as well as all the things we partner up to do.
Thanks so much and thanks for doing this.
Now talk about games.
Alright, we'll try.
Thanks, Bobby.
Bye.
Alright, one more call, then we'll get to Jamie's bit, and then we'll take more calls, because we've still got some energy left in us.
We're going to do a long show tonight, that's alright.
Hi!
We finally got to your call.
Yo, what's up everyone?
Hey!
Hi!
What's good, people?
Amy, you know our call, you know it's official.
The party cannot begin, I'm here.
Yay!
Toga, toga.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
You know, episode 69 is definitely the best episode ever.
I definitely vote on that, and you guys gotta put it up on RSS people, keep the download.
They gotta hear I'm staying in.
They got to.
We'll see what we can do.
I don't know about they have to hear that, but...
You have no say in this, man.
The fans demand it.
There you go.
There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.
Now...
You know, I started my own podcast, and I have to say, you guys were the reason why I started doing this again, you know, because before all of this, I used to run my little two-hour music special on my friggin' cable connection, you know, like maybe every two weeks or whatever, and I just stopped doing it, and after I started listening to you guys again, I'm like, you know, I gotta get into it, you know?
I started listening to other podcasts about anime.
I couldn't get into it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I don't want to get that personal.
I'm only your friend, Ranma, that's all.
I don't know, you guys got anything for Ranma?
Jamie, you've been here to talk to Ranma all night?
Hi.
Hey.
Dude, I want to come to New York.
Dude, I want to come back out to Cali one more time.
I'll try.
Maybe by the end of the year, I'll bring a crew with me.
Maybe.
Cool.
We'll have a barbecue.
Here we go.
I got a question.
Okay, you guys, your little banter there inspired a question here.
Ranma, what are the differences you think, because you've been to both coasts now, what do you think are the differences between the East Coast scene and the West Coast scene?
The gaming and anime scene, because, you know, I know we have a lot of listeners of the show who are deeply, you know, who have anime as a passion as well.
And if you don't, just, you know, tune out for a couple seconds.
Ranma, what would you say is the difference between the gaming and anime scene in the East Coast and West Coast?
Well, I can't say too, too much, but it used to be the West Coast was all about the con, the cosplay, the time you put into making that costume.
The East Coast was like,
We don't give a flying fuck if you did put 100 hours into that freaking Sephiroth costume.
How much alcohol can you take Saturday night?
That's what it was always about.
West Coast was the cosplay.
East Coast was about the party.
I don't know.
Faname has always kind of been about who can hold their liquor.
It's blending now.
I mean, I see on the West Coast, people over there, the West Coast is more fun, more friendly, you know?
That's what I saw.
When I was at Faname, I really had a great time.
I mean...
A lot of props to people.
I don't see a lot of that over on the East Coast, because half the time, it's all about the fucking drama shit.
I mean, on the West Coast, I know there's drama, but they keep it on the down low.
Whereas on the East Coast, all it takes is somebody to walk past, let the drama roll begin, you know?
And it's just too much.
It depends on the clicks.
That too, and it's like, and whereas me, I'm with multiple clicks, and it's like, I gotta be careful who I chill with, and I bet if I had those same clicks on the West Coast...
The drama shit wouldn't even bother.
It was like, fine, whatever.
We're all hanging out.
We're all going to have a good time.
Well, go ahead.
As for the gaming, I would say, you know, one thing about the West Coast, the gamers know how to use deodorant.
That's what I can say.
Definitely.
I didn't really catch too much fanboy funk this year, though.
Exactly.
I mean,
You go to like Otacon, which is like the big connect, you walk in, you're going to get smacked in the face with a wave of funk.
Seriously.
And not the good George Clinton kind, right?
Exactly.
Mm-hmm.
I think it's kind of funky in here because we've been, you know, smelling Rob.
Oh, shut up.
I took a shower today just for you.
Maybe some of your sneakers are on.
Sorry, I just had to run out and check on the air situation because we're burning up in here, so anyway.
Okay.
Ranma, thanks so much for the call and for being a friend.
Thank you for being a friend.
Now, before I go, I have to do the same toast I did last year.
Even though somebody stole it, I'm going to do it.
Go for it.
In my hand is a can of Guinness.
I'm going to crack it open right now.
I have the last sip of champagne left in my glass.
I have champagne in my belly.
Then I'll toast DarkSakura's belly.
No.
No.
I have Guinness at home, so I'll just do it when I get home.
Okay, take it away, Ranma.
Here we go.
Here's to you, here's to me, the best a friend will ever be.
If we ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.
I'm drinking this bitch down.
Very well said.
I actually just tried to use the champagne glass as a microphone.
Oh, no.
All right.
I'll talk to you guys.
I'll see you guys sometime again.
It's going to happen.
Peace.
Do you not want to do mailbag tonight?
I could do mailbag, but no.
Let's do a couple emails.
Okay.
All right, because some folks, not everybody can get in on the phone.
And I really apologize to those of you calling on the phone like crazy.
Some folks have been calling in seriously since we started taking calls and still haven't gotten through.
We're going to take more calls very soon, I promise.
We want to get to the email bags and then more calls, and we'll hopefully get everybody that's trying to call in, even if we have to go to the two-minute lightning round.
All right, here we go.
Mailbag time.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
We always welcome your emails and DarkSakura is going to read them right now.
I am?
Okay.
It's you better.
First email is, Dear OLR, I have one simple question.
What the hell happened to White Knight for the PS3?
Keep up the great work, your Serbian listener, Alyosha.
PS Level 5 needs to make another Dark Cloud game.
I'm the foggiest idea.
I haven't been following that game.
Loki, you know anything about this?
This is more up your alley with the whole title.
It's just not come out yet.
Is it delayed?
Canceled?
It's just kind of sleeping?
Probably sleeping.
You know what?
You know where White Knight is?
It's with Africa.
That's where White Knight went.
The White Knight went to Africa.
That's where it is.
Okay.
We don't know, buddy.
Sorry, they haven't said anything.
That's the best we got.
Unless chatroom knows something, we don't.
What does the chatroom know that we don't?
They're just saying Africa.
Rob, I'll stop making hate mail.
I've decided to make more emails begging Loki to play more Drunken Mario Kart GP.
The annoying 12-year-old who wants a more drunken Mario Kart needs another arcade because the last one left doesn't have DDR but has initial D. But we're suing the place, and so it isn't smart to go there.
Still youngest listener, DDR Maniac, and that's all.
Wow, that's a hell of a signature.
Thank you for backing off for once.
And, you know, YouTube.
We need more stuff on YouTube.
My camera does a lot of better digital stuff now, so we need to do some craziness on YouTube.
Loki, drink, and then we'll film you.
It's funny.
I'm sifting through the emails because I want to get some of them read.
One of them is MasterKiller.
Hi, I hear that Rob bought Puzzle Quest on DS.
I recently purchased the game on PSP.
The game is great, but the game freezes every second.
I'm not sure what it is.
I looked in all the forums, and I'm not the only one.
Does the glitches and freezes occur only on the DS version you have?
Did you hear anything about a recaller patch coming soon?
PS, love the show.
Smile face.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That sounds like a good idea.
Next email, shall I?
Hey OLR crew, first and foremost, congratulations on your 5th anniversary.
OB continued to output the same level of awesomeness or higher in the future.
I started listening to OLR last year after looking for Orange Lounge songs to put on my MySpace profile, only to stumble on the OLR MySpace page.
My first episode, funnily enough, was the fourth anniversary episode, which kept me busy during freshman orientation at my college campus when I have nothing to do and on a road trip to Reno.
On another note, something about the OLR after-birth cage match has been bugging me lately.
Songs that win supposedly get put in rotation on the stream, which I've listened to while playing Albatross 18.
Yet the only cage match winner I've heard on the stream is Loki's Zodiac Don't Play Nice Mashup.
Are these songs actually being put in play, or am I just listening at the wrong times?
Love, GS68.
They are, but the problem is we have a 16-hour playlist on the regular station, and it only is going to come up once in that time.
It sounds like you've heard it once, but the problem is it's one song in a huge rotation of music, so unfortunately it doesn't always come up.
And sometimes it does go into rotation late in the week because I'm lazy.
Last email.
Honestly, though, I have to admit, Cage Match Song going into rotation is the last priority behind getting the podcast out on time and all that, making sure all games gets the syndicated run and all that stuff.
Last email.
Dear Orange Challenge Radio, collectively known as Rob, Matt, and Jamie, congratulations on five years of being a festering rash on the internet.
JK, heart, heart, heart, heart.
Seriously, though, you guys are freaking awesome.
I first learned about LLR through DDR Freak Forums because someone had a link in their signature and decided to check it out.
Unfortunately, I was an internet noob and had no idea what was going on, so I just thought it was a music station.
That was three or four years ago.
Smalthies.
Fall of 05 was when I rediscovered OLR and learned about your now-deceased, frowny-faced OLR to-go edition.
Isn't this for what we're doing, like, for the whole show now?
Well, kinda, but you know, some people liked it better in its compact format, but you know, we have to make decisions based on what we think is best, and you can't please everybody, so sorry you didn't agree.
It was an hour slash hour and a half of news.
Rob being funny, Jamie being angry, and Matt hating on Max.
Woohoo.
That was my freshman year.
Now I'm a junior.
Well, going to be one.
P. The tongue face.
And I've listened to every episode of OLR since you guys started the new format.
You three are my main source of gaming information with Kotaku filling in the blanks.
And also a big source of entertainment.
I have to say that it's mildly awkward when one of you are Rice Princess or Exifer or Casper the Gay.
With an O face.
or anyone else says some hilarious and I burst into laughter in the train and other public place which leads to weird stares and crap mutterings.
That kid is crazy.
Of course, that's half the fun.
I want to get mushy but that's too weird so I'll just leave it at that and congratulate you guys on five years of being some of the coolest people on the internet and wish you luck in the next five years.
I'll make a shirt that says I grew up with Orange Lounge.
Sincerely yours with hearts and love.
Heart, heart, heart, heart.
Sycoon.
P.S.
That was a cute email.
I bought Pac-Man CE and I'm not sure why, cry cry.
PPS, shoot the whoop, charging my lasers.
What?
I don't know, but it's funny.
They just wanted you to say that on air so they could cut that out and have that as a sound effect.
That's great.
Shoot the whoop.
I just go around saying, charging my lasers.
Shoot the whoop.
That was awesome.
You need to send emails like that again so I can say more cool stuff.
You play Pac-Man CE for the Rayvar music, that's why.
That's why you play it.
Yeah.
Hey peoples of OLR, congratulations to 5 years of OLR.
I must admit that I feel kinda old being around for most of those 5 years.
Going back to the drunk episodes and the randomness that is the 3 hour show.
I have so much praise for you guys, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, and everyone else who has made this show what it is today.
So yeah, the reason I'm writing, just recently or probably already implemented the game review site that nobody gives two shits about, NoNotOneUp, GameSpot is going to change its rating systems this week.
They state that they are going to a .5 base system, no more 8.8 like scores.
And I lost my place.
and going to remove the sub-score system for graphics, gameplay, sound, etc.
They are going to add medal-slash-reward-slash-achievement-slash-e-penis points for things like excellent graphics and sound to blatant overwhoring of advertisements and overall suck.
As for many listeners, including myself, we could give a shit!
But it got me thinking, why are people so fixated with a 7 out of 10 score for an average game?
Why, whatever happened to a 5 being averaged?
Is it too low for people?
Is it too close to a 3 or a 1?
Do fanboys have a splintered... By the way, fanboys, to make it plural, you do not add an apostrophe.
Have a splintered baseball bat stuck up their ass?
Who the fuck knows?
I would like to ask if any of the current rating systems work, or do they need to all be revamped?
And Hal, thanks for your time.
GS191.
Wow, heavy question.
It's because now people... I read that like the biggest run-on sentence ever.
Seriously?
If you were to look at, like, mathematically, yes, 5 would be, you know, averaged.
Although people are looking at it like grade scores, which, you know, 50% would be failure and 70% would be average.
So, unfortunately, everybody's sucking that school mentality, and that's why the rating system's all fucked up.
Because it's actually a five-point system instead of ten, because those bottom five are failures.
You know, I don't...
And I might rent it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And you can pretty much guarantee that they're always going to be negative because they're holding off on playing them until later on.
And, you know, it could be stuff that's not half bad, but they have a vendetta against certain things like, you know, for example, Fantastic Four or something.
They'll say, well, I don't like Fantastic Four, so it gets a lower review or something like that.
But this isn't what I remember from the comics.
Review it as a game, not as what you remember from the comics.
Some folks in chat room are talking about X-Play, and JV Mon says, I hate X-Play's Para Para Paradise review.
And, you know, it just goes to show you some people don't get it.
You know, but there's a lot of games out there to play, and sometimes people don't get the things that other folks are into.
Here's the thing.
They weren't actually reviewing Para Para Paradise.
They were doing a funny bit.
That's all they were doing.
I mean, really, it hasn't come up.
That's questionable if it was funny or not.
Well, they were doing a bit, okay?
It hasn't come over here.
It's not a game that was released in the United States.
So why were they reviewing it?
Oh, to be funny.
That's why they were doing it.
Because who doesn't like to laugh at someone playing Power of Paradise?
Because it's such a girly game, and people, you know, like making fun of that.
All right.
Well, anything else, I guess?
No, that was the last email?
No, that's it.
Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
We're running, wow, we're about an hour and a half into this, but we're going to take some more calls.
And keep on going.
So here we go.
Back to the phones.
1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
Can you hear me?
Yes, we can.
Who is this?
Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
What's on your mind?
Oh, not much.
I just really wanted to call and say happy to hear you guys got 500 episodes.
Congratulations.
It's actually five years, not 500, but that's all right.
I'm still blitzed from today.
Are we doing a little drinking today?
No, I was in the middle of the whole Pride thing.
It was nuts.
You know, it's strange that you're not the first person to make that 500 mistake, which is kind of strange.
Okay, I don't feel so bad now.
No, it's cool.
It's all good.
Let's talk about games.
What kind of games have you been playing this week?
Mostly DS stuff.
Are you a big fan of handhelds?
Yeah, they're easy for me to get into and easy for me to take on the go since I'm constantly in one place to another place to another place.
Here's something big that's happened in the past five years.
Remember when the DS was first announced and a lot of people were like, that's kind of weird that you're going to be using the touchscreen.
And now the system is monstrously successful, the Nintendo DS.
Why do you think Nintendo has had such success with the DS?
Because they were forced to actually make games instead of just rehashing some stuff, one.
And two, they actually took advantage of the originality of just using touchscreen, rather than just saying, okay, here's a portable system, let's just bring some games from the other systems and just water it down for the portables.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know what, I actually really agree with that comment.
I think that's why the DS has been successful, is that really the only thing you can do on it is games.
I mean, granted, now they have the Opera browser and all that stuff, but let's face it, all that crap was an afterthought.
It was, you know, really a game system first.
And not to knock the PSP, because I know a lot of folks listen to this show on the PSP, and that's actually why the PSP is pretty awesome.
Because it's like...
It's the red mage of portable gaming is what the PSP is.
It's a little bit of everything, but it's not really strong at anything.
It's a little bit iPod.
It's a little bit web browser.
It's a little bit gaming.
It's a little bit this and that.
But it doesn't really 100% excel at any of it.
But that doesn't necessarily make it bad.
It's a red mage.
That's quite possibly the best comparison I could make.
Well, then you also get the PSP has a lot shorter battery life.
So it does a little bit of a battery life.
That's true.
But don't get me wrong.
I love my PSP.
Try playing a Nomad.
And movies look so sharp on the PSP and so do websites.
That's why I love that little screen on the PSP.
I wish the DS had something that sharp.
I agree with.
I agree with.
And I did play one other game that wasn't a handheld.
What's that?
Virtua Fighter 5 on the PS3.
Ah, now how was that?
I think I'm the only fan of the Virtua Fighter series because I was in love with it.
So you totally love the game?
Oh, I love the series.
Ah.
Well, you know, I don't know, DarkSakura, weren't you a bit of a Virtua Fighter fan, at least in the beginning?
Never.
Really?
I hate Virtua Fighter.
I thought you did like it.
No, Dan loves Virtua Fighter.
I personally thought the game was shit.
I just made you assume that because you're a Sega fangirl.
The only time I played any Virtua Fighter for any amount of time was playing Virtua Fighter 2 to try to knock off Kage's mask.
And people know what I'm talking about.
Yes.
I don't know, I enjoyed the fifth one, and I actually also got to play on...
on a high-definition projector.
Ooh.
Oh, yeah.
I couldn't even play for like five minutes just watching it.
TheRobD says, I was more obsessed with knocking off Blue Mary's shirt in Real Bout 2.
It's always the nudity with you people.
I guess I'll say this.
Have you played Xbox 360?
Never?
A few times, actually, yes.
So what do you think graphics-wise?
Do you think a game like Virtua Fighter will look as good on the 360?
I think it probably would work.
I think it probably would look good.
My only concern about the series is that as long as it moves just the same, just as smooth, because that's a game where it's a true Twitch fest.
One frame and you're dead.
Hmm, good point.
And the reason why I ask that, not that I'm, like, you know, dumb or anything, I just, you know, because sometimes people say, well, the PS3 has the true HD built in and all this, so I'm just kind of, you know, curious, like, you know, they kind of insinuate that it has a graphical edge on Xbox 360, so I'm just kind of curious if anyone ever notices it.
Ever.
I think it would, but I think, honestly, the best way for me, to me, would actually get both of them side by side in a way and see how they look.
Right.
Well...
Um, DDR Dollar Bill, we gotta let you go to take some more calls.
Any last minute thoughts?
Yes, I don't have a podcast.
There you go.
Alright, well then nothing to plug.
So, well, that's cool.
Maybe you'll start one someday.
Eh, I doubt it.
I'm too busy.
Alright, well, fair enough.
Well, thank you for choosing ours to listen to.
We appreciate it.
Thanks, guys.
Later.
Alright, Jamie, you get this call.
This one is your turn.
Hold on, I haven't picked it up yet.
Oh, okay.
Sorry, Skype's being annoying.
Hi.
Hi.
Who's this?
It's Roz.
Hi!
It's Roz!
Oh my god, hi!
Hi.
What's on your mind, Roz?
Um, I mostly wanted to talk to Jamie.
OMG, a girl called in.
OMG, a girl, a real life girl.
What do you want to say to Jamie?
I want to say I'm so sorry for disappearing.
That's okay.
I forgive you, I think.
I do it all the time.
You have to make up for it with bleached zombie butts.
I'm sorry.
What are you turning our fifth anniversary show into, you two?
It's an in-joke.
I see that.
It's on the other site that I hang out on, Gorillas Unofficial.
Ah, I get you.
You remember when we were all in studio playing with that word rearranger thing?
In the chat here.
And she made one that said, Orange Lounge Radio owns everything including bleached zombie butts.
I remember that.
It was one of those fridge magnet site things where you can make your own stuff.
That's part of my signature on Gorillas Unofficial.
Good times.
Yeah.
I totally stole it from Roz.
Yeah, except I disappeared from there, too.
I noticed that, too, Missy.
So you're going to hang out more, right?
Well, you've been busy with school, though, right?
Not really.
Actually, I've been busy with medical problems.
Oh, sorry to hear that.
Oh, it's not any different from usual.
I'm pretty much used to it.
Well, you shouldn't have to be used to that.
It happens.
Yeah.
I can sympathize.
I had my problems last year.
Oh, yeah.
I have drugs for that now.
Yeah.
Luckily, the video game addiction thing didn't go through or I might have a medical problem as well.
I've got a medical problem.
It's called Rob-itis, which would technically mean inflammation of the Rob.
Ew.
Rob, are you inflamed?
Girl, are you trying to say I'm flaming?
I don't know what you're trying to say, girl, but you're making me mad.
Rob's inflamed.
Oh my.
Oh my.
Oh my.
Oh my.
and happy little anniversary, Chindig.
I thought I'd, you know, get back to the planet to join you for this.
Ground control to Major Tom.
Something like that.
Well, we appreciate you and you're a very down-to-earth phone call.
We really appreciate that.
Thanks for calling, Roz.
We missed you.
I know you did.
But my aim's improving.
Bye, Roz.
Take care.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
It's nice to hear from a girl.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hello, this is Orange Lines Radio.
Who is this?
Hello?
Hello.
Hello, it's Shaveymon.
Hey, how's it going?
Hi!
You?
I actually got through.
I didn't think this would ever happen.
So my question's for Rob.
Yes, sir.
Would Flaming Finger ever work on the DS?
Only if it has a soundtrack with the quality of the original Flaming Finger.
For those that have never played Flaming Finger, because I have to give background now, Flaming Finger is one of those ticket-spitter games, and I've only seen them ever in two places.
Dave & Buster's, just about every Dave & Buster's I've ever walked into has one of these machines, and randomly Sunnyvale Golf Land had one.
and you basically, you use your finger to navigate through this maze and the game totally cheats because as you get like three-fourths of the way through the maze, the clock starts counting down much faster.
But it's got this very distinctive rave beat to the game.
Flaming finger!
And of course, you know, all the homosexual jokes you can make with it.
Tee hee gay, tee hee flaming, ha ha ha.
Get your flame on.
Get your flame on!
and, uh, yeah, I kind of froze up and don't know what to say now.
That's it?
That's all you wanted to say?
You wanted to ask if I gave my phone?
I've been trying to get through all night and I finally did.
Just to ask if I enjoy Flaming Finger or if it should come out on the DS.
I also wanted to congratulate you guys for five years.
Thank you.
I remember listening to the first episode and, uh,
I was a complete douchebag back then.
You guys actually banned me from the chat room.
We banned JVmon from chat during the first episode.
That's amazing.
He's since proven himself.
Yes.
Rehab works.
Yeah.
Crying and moaning.
OLR rehab.
I don't know about that, but I'd also like to thank Jamie for introducing me to Doctor Who, my new form of crack.
Yeah.
I'm getting people addicted.
He's also one of the people I talk to every day online, too, now.
Yes, Jamie's my new online BFF.
And thanks for lunch in New York City, Jamie Mon.
I appreciate that.
And I wasn't the one that banned you from chat, was I?
No, I think it was Jamie.
Oh, okay.
Well, you know she does that.
Well, I do that all the time.
With her enormous panhammer.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
for us in gaming in the past five years.
Like, you know how, like, you know, especially five years ago, he signed on to Xbox Live.
It's fag, fag, fag, fag, you know, gay, gay, that's gay.
Do you think there's been any progress?
Because, you know, I noticed the visibility of, like, you know, the gaygamer.net and, like, a lot of those, like, gay gaming communities.
It seems like there's an awful lot more people out there now that will admit they're gay in the gaming scene than there used to be.
I don't know if it's just me, but what do you think?
I just think that over time has passed.
People have just been more accepting about it because it can't hide it anymore.
It's just there and it's out there.
It's either you got with the times or you just got left behind.
So in other words, if you put it on your MySpace profile somewhere, somebody is going to find it and they know.
Pretty much.
If you put it on MySpace, it's on the Internet.
It's like trying to get pee out of a pool.
Do you –
Do you think that it might be a mirror of society where maybe there's been a more general acceptance of gay lifestyle and gay culture in society?
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and it's because of those shows on TV like Queer Eye.
So even though not my kind of show, like, you know, it just kind of gives visibility.
So I don't know.
I guess we're talking about something a lot bigger than gaming.
So I should probably hang up on you now.
If only if you want.
All right.
All right.
Well, take care, JV Mon.
And and yeah, thanks for calling.
And next week for me, like two weeks.
Sweet.
I love CDs.
All right.
I'll let you have more important.
All right.
It's just more calls, JV Ma.
No one call is more important than the other.
All right.
All right.
Take care.
You too.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Now we have people in chat that are like, I'm in choir.
I'm not gay.
I didn't say all.
I just said a lot.
Not even a lot, but you have to admit that there – I don't know.
At least when I was in high school, like at least half the guys in choir were a little bit fruity.
And maybe it's – I would think it's still that way today.
I'm not saying they all are.
Back off.
God, now we're going to get emails and everything, too.
DarkSakura, weren't you in choir?
I was until they made me sing with the boys because I had a low voice.
Gay boys or straight boys?
This was church.
Oh, never mind.
That's different.
Well, no, I did chorus for two weeks, but I was supposed to be in band.
That's a whole other can of worms.
Yeah, I know.
All right.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is FLorex.
Hi, BlackDevilerX.
You're a little bit quiet.
Make sure you're talking right in the mic.
What's on your mind?
Not much.
Gosh, I'm hearing a ringing in the background, but that's okay.
I hear that.
That's weird.
We hear it, too.
That's okay.
Keep trying.
What's on your mind?
I don't know if you called in last week, or if you remember I called in a couple weeks ago, and I was trying to get a Wii, and I finally got one.
You finally got a weed?
It sounds like someone's drinking a Slurpee over there or something, doesn't it?
I can't figure that... I'm sorry, I'm playing with something else here, I'll pump it away.
Ah, that's why we hear... I swear to God, it's like we hear a Slurpee or in the background or something, or like a bong.
Are you smoking weed?
No, I am not smoking weed.
Alright, okay.
Are you smoking crack?
Alright.
Oh.
We're just kidding.
You don't smoke crack in a bong.
Anyway.
Not that I'd know.
So you finally got a Wii.
I did.
Congratulations.
How did you manage to do it?
I actually had to buy it in a bundle with two other games and another Wii remote.
And where did you get this bundle at?
I got this bundle at the Virgin Mega Store.
Ah, so a forced bundle.
What do you think about forced bundles?
I don't like them.
But you bought one anyway.
I just really don't like them.
Especially when the game selections suck.
You probably can't hear it on your end, but we keep hearing this little... It's like a slurpee or a ring or something every two seconds.
It's so funny.
Anyway, so are you happy now that you got a Wii?
Have you actually been playing it?
Yes.
I've got... Well, the two games that I had to get were Marvel Ultimate Alliance and Spider-Man 3.
Very good.
You didn't opt for Zelda or Trauma Center or any of that stuff?
They didn't have Zelda.
They didn't have Trauma Center.
I mean, their game selection just sucked.
They had Cooking Mama.
Well, Cooking Mama's a little bit better on the DS than it is on the Wii, to be honest.
Okay, so the main thing I wanted to do tonight while I was calling in was back when I was listening, I think a couple of years ago before I had kind of the Sunday night commitment and I dropped out and I'm sorry, was to open a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.
And here I am opening a pint of
of Chocolate Cookie Dough Ice Cream in your honor.
This is like my little toast.
Here we go.
All right.
I'm clanking my empty champagne glass to your cookie dough ice cream.
There you go.
My stomach is digesting in honor of your ice cream.
All right.
We got to let you go, buddy.
That ringing is driving me nuts.
But thank you very much for the call and listen to the playback on the podcast because it's hilarious.
Banana phone.
Bye.
Bye.
Hey, this is Jonathan Fields, how you doing?
Hi, who?
John Fields.
Oh, hi!
You were on the show like a long-ass time ago.
He's the guy that flew out here like all the way from like, what, Connecticut you're at?
Yeah, Connecticut.
I'm in New Jersey now.
Oh.
But I was there back when Tech TV was still around.
I remember that.
I remember you came to the show.
Do you remember what episode number that was?
I don't remember off the top of my head, but it was like the year before G4 bought him out.
Okay, so it was probably in the low 100s, right?
About the time you were there?
Yeah.
Maybe 4.69, I'm trying to remember.
I know, everything's changed.
I mean, your format has changed.
I mean, Megas has changed his name, all that sort of stuff.
And...
And to be totally honest, you guys are lucky that the anniversary is happening today and not yesterday, because otherwise you'd be facing against a big hedgehog.
Wait, what's yesterday?
Sonic's birthday.
Well, you know, technically the show started on June 23rd, so yesterday was our birthday, but we celebrate it tonight because it's Sunday.
Exactly.
So there you go.
I was wondering, actually, Rob.
What?
Did you ever watch any of the big gaming cartoons way, way back in the 80s?
I watched the Super Mario Bros.
Super Show religiously every day after school and would also watch the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.
That was my show.
I didn't really watch Captain Anne or any of the other ones, but that was the one.
Did you know that stuff is on DVD now?
Yes, I have the second season on DVD.
I need to find the first.
You can probably find it on Amazon.
I really need to get the Zelda DVD too.
For some reason I just never bought it.
I've been busy watching all these other shows but I definitely want the Zelda DVD package as well.
I keep seeing that one every time I go on Amazon, so they keep recommending it to me, so you can probably find it easy.
You kind of brought up the whole tech TV thing, and you've been talking a lot about television.
I'm kind of curious, because it's funny, a lot has changed there.
Tell us really quick again, what would you say some of your experiences at the tech TV studios when you went?
What kind of stuff did you observe?
Did people seem to be enjoying themselves?
How was the tour when you went?
Well, basically what it was like was I basically went into the headquarters where the main shows were developed there.
I got to meet Adam Sessler.
I pretty much walked around where everybody's office space was, and I've still got a few Tech TV swag stuff.
That's pretty rad, man.
Those are collector's things now.
I know.
And then after that, I took a little shuttle over to the studio, and I sat in on an episode of The Screensavers.
Wow, that's great.
That's cool.
And it's kind of sad now that that show's gone.
My dad loved The Screensavers, too, and it was a really great show.
It's just kind of sad to see what happened in the end to all that stuff.
Actually, Leo and the gang, they're all still around.
They're just doing a show now called This Week in Tech.
Oh, yeah.
If you're in the podcasting biz, you know This Week in Tech.
It's huge.
It's a huge show.
VO also has a KFI show in California.
I'm glad to see he's still kicking because, you know, folks like him are the kind of folks that inspire us.
I know, and if...
G4 hadn't brought out Tech TV, I'd probably be working there now.
Happy 5th anniversary and a happy 5 more.
It's all good.
We know that things change.
Have a good one, buddy.
You too.
Bye-bye.
We've hit the two-hour mark, but of course that counts the bonus segment, which was a good ten minutes long, which the podcasters don't get to hear.
So we're going to take a few more calls?
A few more?
Okay.
All right, let's keep going.
Are you guys okay on time and everything?
Yeah, I've only got to work overtime.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, it's cool.
I'm joking.
Tonight's a special night.
All right, Loki, your call.
Hello, who is this?
Hello.
Hello.
This is Dr. Papatskou City.
How's it going?
Just great.
Hooray!
More international listeners.
We love hearing from the international folks.
Let you know that I just love the show for the last year and a half.
Well, we really appreciate that.
Thank you very much for listening to us for the past year and a half.
Any highlights from our show?
Well, actually what I do have is a question.
Oh, what's that?
What's with the name?
I assume you did have an orange lounge?
No.
Where did that
You know what?
Very famous question we often get asked a lot, especially since we've started getting more listeners, since we moved into the general gaming chat, because anybody that played Mamani Games probably knows where the name comes from.
But Jamie, I'll let you take this one, because you helped come up with the name.
Oh, yeah, where we got our name from.
We were on the train coming into San Francisco for something.
We were going to the Metreon that day, right?
and we've been trying to think of all day a name for the station and when we came back, I was like, we should call it Orange Lounge Radio because it's Orange Lounge.
Music, Radio
And we're very thankful to Konami for not suing us for using the name, but I think they realized we gave them free advertising and still continue to do so for a long time.
And Orange Lounge Radio is different from Orange Lounge, so there you go.
Well, that just goes to show you that I have absolutely not a care for music games.
It's all good.
Some of our listeners don't, and that's just fine.
So, you know, we try to...
Sorry, Jamie was showing me a private message.
Don't do that.
You distract me during the show.
Yeah, but it just goes to show, you know, we love, you know, the fact that since we have done the merge, even though not everybody was supportive when we kind of did away with talking about Bomani, only talking about general gaming, I really love that we've kind of opened it up to a whole new audience as well, you know, and it's not just about the music games.
Okay, then.
Probably I'll give you a call the next time I get Santa Cruz and have a present for you guys.
Oh, sweet.
Thank you.
And I love Santa Cruz.
I love the boardwalk there.
We'll have to go to the arcades.
Awesome.
Oh, the arcades there are awesome.
They have discs of Tron.
Sweet.
They do.
They do.
All right.
Well, thank you very much for your call.
We appreciate it, buddy.
No worries.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
So refreshing to hear from the folks around the world.
It's so great.
How come we haven't had any Canadians tonight?
That's very strange.
We want Canadians to call next.
We want Canadians.
All right.
I declare there must be Canadians.
Not that we don't love the Argentina, the Mexico, the U.S., you know, but Europe might be asking a bit much because it's probably like what now?
It's like the sun's starting to rise over there.
But what about some Canadians?
I know there's got to be a few listening.
All right, let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, this is Jaden.
I'm sorry, who?
Jaden.
Hi, what's on your mind?
Nothing much.
I just wanted to congratulate you on your fifth.
Well, thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Are you my fifth beer?
Pardon?
Nothing.
I was saying my fifth beer.
I do that all the time.
Well, thank you very much.
Is there a particular something something that you want to share with the listeners tonight?
How long have you been listening to this show?
Um, let's see, I think this is going on my third Ah, awesome Well, what do you think has been a big, big game story that you really enjoyed our coverage on in the past three years?
Um, the anticipation of the Xbox 360 Ah, the anticipation of the Xbox 360 You know, I wasn't sold on the Xbox 360 at first I really wasn't And also the introduction of new systems in general
Oh, kind of like being able to kind of be watching this new wave of the whole next-gen systems, kind of watch this unfold, because, you know, all these systems didn't exist.
The PS3, the Wii, the 360 back when we started.
Hell, I don't even think the Xbox existed when we first started.
Or maybe it had just come out.
I don't know.
I think it was out.
When did the Xbox come out?
2001?
So maybe it was just out.
But anyway, yeah, we kind of got to watch this all unfold.
Loki, what...
You bought a 360 the day they came out, right?
No.
You bought a bidded one.
You eBayed one or something, didn't you?
I bought it off Craigslist.
Oh, I remember getting so mad at you about that.
But why did you do it?
Was it the hype?
Was it the games?
I just wanted to talk about it.
And I'm crazy.
Very crazy when it comes to talking about games and stuff.
I don't know.
I just felt like I wanted one.
It was big.
I got to keep my edge at work, you know?
You know what sold me on Xbox 360, sad but true?
Geometry Wars.
And Xbox Live Arcade in general.
I was like, this is the coolest thing ever.
It wasn't even any of the launch games that I really cared about.
Although I did buy Cameo and I don't know what else I bought at launch.
But it was Xbox Live Arcade.
I bought Cameo, Ridge Racer 6.
Actually, I pretty much bought almost everything that came out at launch between launch and March.
I think one of the big ones I bought was Call of Duty 2, and then I bought Project Gotham Racing 3, also Cameo, and then Perfect Dark Zero, and I bought almost everything that came out at launch.
Caller, did you get in on the Xbox 360 craze?
No, I didn't.
You didn't buy one until way later, huh?
No, I don't have one Because I'm not an Xbox person I'm a Nintendo person No No, I'm not that crazy I thought about it at one point in time, but
Thank you for watching!
Over on Sunrise.
That's where we were.
That was awesome.
And we had a listener of the show on the line.
A couple.
I want to know if any of them are still listening.
For the love of God, email us.
Let's get together and play Wii sometime.
I want to know who the girl who got the Wii hat was.
DarkSakura's reaction to the DS, something that shares your namesake.
Do you approve?
I guess.
It's almost as cool as me.
Do you remember when we went and bought our DS?
We went to Best Buy, bought them there, and then we also went to Benihana's afterwards for lunch.
That is the most money I've ever spent in a single day, probably.
I found Dan's box for his DS, because they all got theirs at GameStop before launch date, of course.
And it said, this DS is reserved for Dan.
If you touch it, you die.
I won't forget the first time... The post-it's still on the box.
The first PSP I bought, I bought it, and then I...
Nope.
Other than... Other than the...
The one episode that really sticks out to me because I have a recording of it is 120.
What's so special about 120?
You'll have to forgive us, but they all start to blend together when you've been doing it for five years.
Because one of the big things is that Loki was called the Xbox 2 at the time.
Did he?
Well, he probably didn't have a name then.
Did it have a name or was he just being dumb?
They didn't have a name for it, but he mentioned it several times.
Interesting.
Well, shit.
I mean, if they don't have a name for it yet, obviously it's going to be the Xbox 2.
But it's funny to go back and listen to what we thought about things before they actually came out.
I think they're going to be stupid and name it 360 because it'll be circular.
I don't know.
You called the PS3 name, right?
Well, yeah, because they didn't innovate on their name.
We're going to put a 3 on there.
Yeah.
Alright.
Caller, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling.
Yep, sure, anytime.
Alright, later.
Alright, bye.
Bye.
Alright, let's do a few more calls.
Now it's starting to trickle up a little bit.
We still have some people hammering us that have been since the beginning, so we'll get to everybody.
We're going to keep calling until the calls stop coming in.
Or we pass out tired, whichever happens first.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Token Canadian calling in.
Hi, what's your name for those who don't know?
It's Toshin, what's up guys?
Toshin, what's up?
See?
Ask and ye shall receive.
We got a Canadian on the line.
Yay, thank you.
What else can I do?
I don't know.
Do a cartwheel or say a boot.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm totally kidding.
I'll bring pizza or something.
I don't know.
Toshin, dude, anything you want to say?
Are you only calling in because we forced you to or is there anything you want to say or ask or what?
No, no, no.
I want to be like everybody else and congratulate you on the five years.
Appreciate it.
Probably not the longest call or listener, but I've been around for a while and
I just haven't had the nerve to jump in the chat room as much as I should.
Because you were on DDR Freak like several years ago.
You've been posting there a while, right?
Yeah, we've got a small little thread for our DDR people.
Sweet.
And the reason why I mention that is because obviously when our show first started, a large, large contingent of our listeners were all DDR Freak members and people from that community.
So, you know, I do remember seeing your face around there back in the day, so.
Yeah, the small little Nova Scotia thread for anybody who wants to go check it out.
We still got some life.
And the machines have not frozen over, contrary to popular belief.
No, they're not.
But we gotta deal with some of the machines' issues, because they're in bad, bad shape.
You know what my favorite thread on DDR Freak was always?
What?
Was the Antarctica thread.
Yeah, that was pretty funny.
Thanks for watching!
Exactly.
Well, Toshin, thanks for answering the call.
We appreciate it.
Any other last things you want to say?
I want to just... How are you doing with... I know you've played DDR and B-Money for a while.
What's your favorite game that you've played throughout the years?
Is it just like B-Money or DDR Stepping?
My favorite music game that I've played in the past five years?
Yeah.
Absolutely, without a doubt, Beatmania 2DX8 style in the arcade.
Oh, sexy.
and those that know me well know what a big ham I am.
One of my favorite things to do is host.
When I was young, I always wanted to be a game show host, if it's not completely obvious through some of the things that happen on this show.
That's part of the reason I continue to be an MC-ish sort of role on this show.
I love doing that kind of stuff at tournaments.
and running the Beatmania 2DX tournament, one of the very few that's ever been run, being able to run that tournament on that 8-style machine at Scandia was a dream.
And the mix itself was awesome.
The music that was in it and everything, just really the peak of the 2DX series for me.
So are you planning to get distorted and stuff in the coming weeks?
Well, like I said, 8th was kind of the peak, and my interest in the series has kind of waned since then.
I mean, I will always love the game, and I can't justify spending $80 on it.
Not now, not right now.
You can always... No, but I don't go there, you know.
I don't know.
Import, man, come on.
I import straight to my hard drive.
The Rob D says from Bob Barker to Rob Roberts.
Dude, that would be my dream.
I actually secretly in the back of my mind, I secretly wish that they would do like an American Idol style show to replace him because I would so go there.
You know what we have to hear now?
We have to hear that song.
The Come On Down?
Yes.
Maybe later in the show because I don't have it queued up right now.
You never have it queued up at this time though.
It's getting late.
Give me a break.
I need more pizza.
All right.
We ate it all.
It's all gone.
The three of us ate the whole damn pizza.
A large.
We're piggies.
Oh, my God.
All right.
Bye, Tosha.
Thanks so much for the call.
We appreciate it.
Yeah.
Happy 5th, guys.
All right.
Thank you.
Take care, buddy.
Love that.
Ask for a Canadian and you shall receive a Canadian.
All right, we're well past the two-hour mark now, so we're going to go into the two-minute lightning round, and now all our calls are going to be wrapped up in two minutes or less.
So here we go, starting off, and Jamie, your call.
What?
Hello?
Hello.
Hi.
Hi, it's the Afro guy.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
What's on your mind, Afro guy?
Hi.
Turn down your speakers, buddy.
Ah, sorry.
That's okay.
Are you calling us from the UK?
Yeah.
Ah, I knew it.
I could tell from the accent.
That's amazing.
And I recognize your name, too.
Wow, so you're like, it's early morning.
It's almost six in the morning, yeah.
You are hard.
What are you doing awake?
Listening to the fifth anniversary show.
Well, we appreciate you tuning in.
You are a hardcore fan, sir.
I wish we weren't in the two-minute lightning round at this point.
What do you want to say?
I just want to say thanks for doing the show for five years.
I mean, I've only been listening for about two years since you started the podcast.
Well, you're welcome.
I mean, we do this for folks like you that continue to listen in, and especially around the world.
That blows my mind how the Internet brings us that closer together as gaming fans.
Great.
Well, now I've cooled in, I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'm so tired.
I say that's a good call.
Sleep in today.
Sleep well.
You've earned it, my friend.
Thank you.
All right.
Have a good one, buddy.
All right.
See you.
Bye.
Poor neighbors, because you must be blasting the show at 6 a.m.
over there.
because we're hearing it on the speakers.
Unless he had a room with an echo, could be.
Yeah, it could be.
He's trying to keep it down.
I don't know.
Who knows?
All right, two-minute lightning round.
Let's take some more calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello?
Hi.
You got through finally.
Who is this?
Nintendo Maniac 64.
Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.
What's on your mind?
I don't know.
I guess I'm on the opposite.
It's not early morning.
It's early...
It's kind of late night, 1253 AM here.
It's about 10 PM here, so we're getting pretty late even for California time, but that's okay.
What's on your mind?
One thing I remember is something someone said.
It was about like your first game and stuff that you played.
In all honesty, my very first game, I was like three or four something, was Mortal Kombat.
Your first game was Mortal Kombat?
And I didn't even know what it was.
Was it the version where they replaced the blood with the sweat, though?
Because that doesn't count.
No, it was the Genesis version.
Oh, it was the Genesis version.
So did you put in the blood code?
I don't know.
Only like three or four.
I didn't have my own game system until I was like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Uh, no.
So, well, I'm just trying to say that, you know, exposing, you know, kids to violent games doesn't necessarily make them murderers.
That's all.
All right, anything else you want to share with listeners?
Uh, oh, I finally got my own pretty good computer rig now, not like a 533 megahertz PC.
God, I thought he was going to say I got my own podcast.
I don't have a podcast.
All right, that's all right.
Two minutes is up, buddy, but thanks so much for the call and take care, okay?
Okay.
Alright, bye-bye.
Bye.
Alright, let's go to another call.
These poor people have been trying to get in all night long.
We gotta get their calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Who's this?
I don't know.
It's Dark Knight.
Oh, we can barely, barely hear you.
Get a little closer to your night.
Yes, Dark Knight, but we can barely hear him.
Hello?
Hey.
Hey, what's on your mind?
Um, quick, um, quick shout-out.
Um, what?
Um, congratulate y'all guys on five years.
and hopefully y'all do five more years while y'all still around and everything like that.
And to back talk the gaming thing, my first gaming system was the Atari 2600.
Yeah, mine too.
Preach on.
Atari 2600 was awesome.
We'll try to do another five years if we can.
We're going to keep going until we're out of gas.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, Dark Knight, our time is halfway up, but I've got to ask you real quickly, is there anything that you want to share?
Because I know you've been a long-time listener of Orange Laundry.
I recognize your name from chat from years ago.
Is there a favorite moment?
Loki getting drunk and parents calling the show.
Oh, when our parents have called in?
Yeah, and Loki's was the best one.
Loki had the best parent call.
Yeah, because it was sister that called.
Mm-hmm.
and then next thing you know it was the parents behind her.
I remember that.
Parents and grandparents, yeah.
That was good.
Dark Knight, our time's almost up.
Quick, any last minute thoughts?
No, just want to say happy five years, OLR, and keep it rocking, guys.
All right, we will do, buddy.
Thanks so much for your support over the past five years.
We appreciate it.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
He got progressively louder as the call went on.
Very nice job.
Appreciate that.
He started to turn the volume up or something.
Loki, your call.
Hello, this is Orange Launch Radio.
Who is this?
Hey, it's SSJ1.
Hey, how's it going?
It's really got in, it looks like.
I just want to wish you guys a happy fifth birthday, I guess.
And I also want to thank Rob for coming out to New York and having a great time with us.
I had an awesome time.
It was so much better this year than last year.
And no offense against last year.
I mean, we did our thing and had fun, but that was more of a me thing because I had more time this year to actually go around and do stuff.
And the stuff we did this year was going to Dave & Buster's and going to that video game shop.
It was just like we were buds hanging out.
It was a good time.
I had a really good time.
It was great.
And, you know, that's how gamers should be.
And, you know, OR, we're just one big family.
And that's how we should always be.
Awesome.
Well, hey, since you're in New York, or at least the New York area, if a gamer is thinking of visiting the area, because New York is a huge tourist spot, where are some places they must go in New York?
You know, I've just moved back here, but, you know, big New York places, I would say go to the forums, because, you know, the locals really know where the good places are.
You know, there's a lot of places...
what about Nintendo World Store
Well, yeah, Nintendo World Store is great.
I mean, I thought you meant, like, arcades type stuff.
No, that's true.
That's true.
And those are good stuff to point out, too, because, you know, certain people, when they try, you know, they want to find that local fighting game or dance game community or whatever it is.
SJ100, Matt, our time is up.
Real, real quickly, last minute thoughts.
Well, no, I, you know, I've been trying to call in all night.
I wanted to ask this one question.
You know, you guys have been on for five years, and
What would be the one thing you would like to accomplish within the next five years?
Big question, so I'm going to let someone else start off.
What would be the one thing you'd like to accomplish in the next five years?
With the show?
With the show or in general or what?
With the show.
I would really call this ambitious.
But I would really like to not only do this internet-based, but do it satellite-based as well.
Loki?
To have my wife approve of the show.
That's a big one, right?
That's a very lofty goal right there.
I'm going to be a little bit controversial because I know how Jamie feels about this idea, but I'm going to say video.
That would be cool, you know.
And I think you know, Rob, that I'm kind of in that business.
If you guys ever need someone to shoot it or direct it, I'm here.
Help me talk Jamie into it.
That's what you've got to help me do.
All right, we've really got to let you go.
We're over time.
But take care, buddy.
Thanks so much.
Take it easy, guys.
Bye-bye.
All right, I think it's slowing down.
I think we've only got a couple calls left.
But I really want to give a chance for everybody to get through.
Jamie, how about you?
Hello.
Hello.
Who be?
This is Wonder Dog Harold.
Hi!
Hello.
What do you have to say to us?
What do you have to say for yourself?
Congratulations on your 5th anniversary.
Thank you.
Did you get us a present?
No, like the customary gift for the 5th anniversary is this.
Is what?
It's wood.
It's wood.
It's wood.
I got wood.
I have no wood.
There you go.
No gift needed.
Will you try to get some wood for our fifth anniversary?
Maybe.
All right.
Is there a game out there that gives you wood?
No.
No?
That's good because, you know, that would be maybe crossing the line a bit.
Really?
There's been no game character ever that might give you a little wood?
No.
My first video game crush was Ryu from Street Fighter 2.
What?
No, I tried to, like, like...
Dick and Tingle in there real quick.
Oh, Tingle, Tingle.
No, this was when I was in high school.
I gotcha.
Loki, any character ever given you wood?
No.
No Dead or Alive?
No.
Somebody in our chat room is trying to start a petition for Dead or Alive Extreme Volleyball with men.
So, I don't know about that one.
All right, any last minute thoughts, caller?
Nope.
All right, well, you're a man of many words, Wonder Dog Carol.
Thanks so much for the call.
As usual.
Take care, buddy.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Remember when he called in the match game a few weeks ago and was giving all one word answers?
I think the phone lines may have stopped.
There's no calls coming in right now.
Let me give it just a few more minutes to make sure.
And then we're going to call.
Oh, there it is.
Here's one more.
This is going to be the last.
You had to encourage them, Rob.
This is the last call.
Last call.
Sorry, guys.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and this is the last call of the night.
Who's this?
Oh, my God.
Who is this?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm speechless, you know, I'm the biggest fangirl of the show is interested in me and well, you know.
Oh my god.
I forgot, this show has helped facilitate a few OL relationships, which has been very interesting how that community, just communities in general, can have that effect.
I've met a few people I've dated through live journals in that community.
I can't say I've ever met anyone in a gaming-related community, but it's just interesting the way that works.
But DT, you've been here for the whole thing.
What would you say was the highlight of the past five years?
Oh my god, I don't know.
Aside from that thing on 230, I'd probably have to go with Loki singing.
Isn't it amazing that after all these years, they still say that's their favorite moment?
That was awful!
I'm never doing it again, so like it.
Live it up while it lasts.
I'm calling in.
I want the host to know I like their show.
Whatever.
Oh, DarkTetsuya, thank you for making it all worth it.
That was wonderful.
I do have a quick FU, though.
All right.
I don't know, DT, because that's like the perfect note to end on.
But if you must, go for it.
FU.
FU to Burger King, because Missy has to work tonight.
FU to work in general.
Let's quit our jobs and move into the fort.
Yeah.
The OLR Fort.
Dark Tetsuya, thank you so much for the call.
We appreciate it.
And you fucking won, by the way.
Out of all the callers tonight, you won.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Take care.
I'm calling in.
I now demand that all future call-ins begin with that.
Well guys, the calls have finally slowed down, but if we didn't get to you, we're so sorry that we didn't make your phone call.
Obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, and even to the podcast listeners and those that weren't able to tune in live tonight and listen to us and be a part of this show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Fuck everything.
I'm just going to do the show.
I'll try.
Thank you, guys.
And thank you for the five people who've sent me a dollar, by the way.
There's not going to be a pump up the volume, though, on Tuesday.
This is very important because Live 365 is doing a day of broadcasting silence to protest whoever those fuckheads are that are doing all this bullshit to internet radio.
The government.
Yeah.
Like I said, fuckheads.
So no Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday, no nothing on Tuesday.
However...
You best hold on to your pants on Wednesday because Rob's going to be on, right?
That's right.
The door is always open for you, DarkSakura, if you want to come in and get a little revenge on Wednesday since you can have a Tuesday show.
I don't know what you've got going on.
We'll see.
Oh wait, no, there is no show Wednesday.
I'm in Malibu Wednesday.
I can't go.
Bitch!
So maybe you can do your show Wednesday.
Keep me.
And then drop me off in LA so I can go to Disneyland.
We'll talk offline.
I'm seeing Transformers on Wednesday.
Jamie reminded me, there are some thank yous that are badly, badly needed because there's like specific individuals we have to thank because they've really made the five years worth it.
And please, you know, God, it's just like an Oscar speech.
We're afraid we're going to forget somebody.
But if you guys think...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The man just does this because he wants to and he loves what we're doing.
And without him, we would not be able to accomplish half of what we have.
So VXJasonXV, you are the man.
Thank you so much for all of your help.
Even though we joke that the chat room is the invisible fourth host of Orange Lingerie, Jason is like this invisible thing that you don't always see on the air that's really holding this show up.
So thank you so much to Jason, first and foremost.
I also want to say...
A big thank you to Travis Donovan of Travis Donovan Live because he kind of got me into the whole internet broadcasting thing and Jamie to some extent because obviously Under Station Live was the show we were doing before Orange Lounge Radio.
I was the number one guest.
I don't think Travis really approved of this side project in the beginning because he saw it as maybe taking away from Under Station Live or what have you, but...
Thanks for watching!
I want to say a big thank you as well to Bobby Blackwolf and Scott and Lawrence and everybody over at allgames.com for enabling our show to a whole new audience because obviously signing up with allgames.com was one of the best moves we ever made in trying to grab ourselves some rabid fans.
We just love the fact that our fan bases have kind of clicked in that way.
And while not everybody on All Games May Like Our Show, those that have, we're very lucky to have over here listening to OLR as well.
And we want to thank you guys for helping us get on board with the syndication over there and opening everything up over there.
God, I don't even...
So many, I mean, obviously each and every person that's ever listened to a live show, ever downloaded a podcast, everybody that's authored stories for the website, Mel B, Dark Tetsuya, Jimmy, DMN, anybody that's been a part of like OLR staff.
I want to thank Chris for a lot over the past few years.
God, who am I forgetting?
Anybody?
Anything?
And viewers like you.
I mean listeners.
Alright, and if I left you out, I'm very, very sorry, but it was kind of like a last minute thing I wanted to bring up.
Loki, do you have anything you want to say?
Not until the afterbirth.
Okay, we'll leave it at that.
Loki, by the way, was not an official host of Orange Launch Radio for the first 20 episodes, but you know what?
He never missed a show and had that dedication, and it's very interesting.
I didn't even freaking know Loki, really, before this show started, but now it's just, you know... I drove you down to Golf Land, dude!
But that was like... But it wasn't... Like, we didn't... You know, we didn't really know each other, like, at that point.
You know, I feel like I didn't really get to know you until this show.
Like, I know who you were, and obviously you did a lot of nice things...
That's what I want to say about Loki is that I know a lot of you think he's a total dick based on the things that he says about Max and stuff, but he's actually one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet offline, and I'm sorry for ruining your internet persona.
Whatever.
But he really is.
I don't have a persona.
And Jamie, too, because I know she has sometimes the internet persona of being the Queen Bee on Orange Light Radio.
I know.
But she's really got a softy heart, too.
You just don't always see it on the show.
You do.
It's made of sponge.
No, it's not.
It's plasmoid.
It's a plasma, which means the electrons are charged and it's fiery.
I have a fiery heart.
Okay.
Now, one more thing.
Not everybody got to get through on the Skype line tonight, but this was the interesting thing is that I logged into Skype today and there were voicemails waiting for us congratulating us on the fifth anniversary from people who wouldn't necessarily be able to be here on the show tonight.
And so I hopped into chat and I said, well, looks like we have some voicemails.
Anyone want to add some?
And we had some folks call in.
And so we're going to end it on this sound clip and then we're going to kind of wrap it up and be out of here.
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
You want to do some last minute game stories before we get to that?
Oh, yeah, real quick, just real quick.
There's a brand new hack in the PSP world that allows homebrew on any firmware so far, all the way up to 3.5.
And funny enough, it does not use Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, but it uses Luminous.
And it's a Luminati workaround or whatever, exploit, I guess they're calling it.
But very interesting to see that.
After all this time, Luminous can now allow you to run homebrew.
It was there the whole time.
It's almost like a mystery novel.
Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail.
Is that it?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Until the afterbirth.
Let's get to the voicemails, folks.
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio, 5th Anniversary Show.
I am Insanus, the guy who does the show on Thursday.
I want to call you guys, wish you all a happy, happy, happy 5th Anniversary from everybody here at the Insanus Hour, which right now is me and four listeners.
So, yeah.
But, um...
On behalf of everybody in the chat room right now, everyone is wanting to call you guys and wish you a happy OLR 5th anniversary.
Rob, Jamie, Matt, thanks for letting me have an evening on the station where I can say as many curse words as I like and enjoy myself.
You guys are the reason I love doing this.
I got started because of you guys.
You probably have heard this shit sometimes before, but it's true.
You guys are awesome.
Hopefully soon here I'll be in Sacramento and we will all have a good, good time.
But let's just hope Rob keeps his pants on.
Jamie doesn't beat me with a ferret and Matt doesn't throw an iPhone at me.
Anyways guys, this is a long voice mail and I think I should stop talking like this because I think I'm pissing you all off.
Also, Rob, your mom called.
She's still just as lonely as you.
And my mom called, and she's still as lonely as you.
Okay, I'm done.
Bye.
Hello, Iron Clones Radio folks.
It's, uh, Scott.
So, I don't remember what my screen name is on the LLR.
Hi, Rob.
Hi, Jamie.
Well, I talk to people all the time on MySpace and Xbox Live.
Rob, it's me.
Yes, anyway.
Wow, five years.
Happy anniversary!
Um, oh my, you know, the worst half, better half.
Um, well, I got to listen to you people.
Um, yeah, uh, well, we wanted to say hello.
Say hello.
Hello.
Yeah, that would be good.
He's more lesbian than the official lesbian.
Well, more girl.
Anyway, um, wow, five years of gaming goodness and listening to Loki bitch about women drivers.
It's all good.
Two, five more years at least.
Alright, bye.
Hey, it's Missy.
So, you know I had to call in, right?
It'd be a 15th anniversary and all.
Keep the work going.
Alright, call in live.
Yeah, let's see.
4-7-0-4.
So it's been three years and three months already.
Oh, that was a Wednesday too.
Wasn't it Vanilla Sky that was the Wednesday show then?
Anyway, congrats on five years.
And I'll be thinking about you when the number works.
Bye.
Hey, what's up?
This is Tiger Claw.
I would like to wish Orange Lounge Radio a happy five-year anniversary.
I've been a long-time listener of the show since I first heard on allgames.com.
And here's hoping for five more years.
Take care.
Hey all alive, this is Mystic Gohan.
Congratulations on five years of podcasting, I guess.
I have a question about, I saw Sky on Xbox Live with the HD DVD player.
I was wondering if it's worth the buy because my brother kind of wants it.
And he's wondering if you could get a PS3 instead just for Blu-ray.
And yeah, you guys have been doing an awesome job.
I've been listening for about two years now.
You guys are just awesome.
Keep doing what you're doing.
Bye.
Really either one.
I mean, they say Blu-ray is winning, but I don't know if that's just marketing smoke and mirrors.
I think it's too early to tell.
Honestly, your safest bet is to not take the plunge yet.
Well, the reason why they're saying it's winning is because there's more Blu-ray players out there because each one of the PlayStation 3s is a Blu-ray player.
So they're counting those in the numbers, whether people use them as a Blu-ray player or not.
All right.
So there's your answer.
Short and sweet.
All right.
We're almost to the end.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, Loki.
I'm out of root beer.
DarkSakura.
My final thought is thank you.
To those that care, thank you.
You keep it going.
You keep it awesome.
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 237.
It's five years and one week anniversary next week.
We'll do it all again.
See ya.
