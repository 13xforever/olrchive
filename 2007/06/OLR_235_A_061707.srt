Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roko

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, June 17th, 2007, SoulCalibur preps its fourth game for the Playstation 3 and 360

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sony builds itself a blog, and has Project Hammer gotten some nails in its coffin?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ripping it off and beating you with it, maybe?

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It happened in Shaun of the Dead, except they ripped off his legs and then went after zombies with him.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That was the best scene in the movie.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who hasn't seen Shaun of the Dead yet?

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Go see hot fuzz, everybody, by the way.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Here goes the chatroom going, me, me, me.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hello.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Have you seen Shaun of the Dead, Loki?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Um, twice.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's good times. I have to admit when DarkSakura, you know, because she does movie nights once in a while at her place,

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I admit when she first was like, let's watch Shaun of the Dead, I was like, oh god, alright, fine, we'll watch a movie.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's only two hours. It was actually really good.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know if you were there a couple years ago, but we did Shaun of the Dead and then we watched the new Dawn of the Dead.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Actually, I think it was in the reverse. We watched the new Dawn of the Dead and then Shaun of the Dead.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I wasn't there because I never saw the new Dawn of the Dead.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The new Dawn of the Dead sucked. Shaun of the Dead was awesome, though, and hot fuzz is better.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I still haven't seen hot fuzz.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hot fuzz is great. I've seen it twice now.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've seen it twice.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, give me one of yours.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I went to see it with Ranma.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I seriously can't remember the last.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's right.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
When we left, you guys went to movie transformers early.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do you?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Before it comes out.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Lucky you. How do you explain that?

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Through work stuff?

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, through work.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, very nice.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A few days.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't wait.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Are we a movie podcast?

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey, they're making a game based on it, and it's going to be fucking awesome.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And they should make a game out of Shaun of the Dead, shouldn't they?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They should.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Absolutely.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hot fuzz would be funny, too.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A romantic comedy was Zombies of the Game.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
One of these days, I seriously think the last movie I saw in the theater was Notes on a Scandal, which they should not make into a video game.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't think that would be a very interesting video game.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Scandal.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You can control Judi Dench as she creates lesbian scandal.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It would be wonderful.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All right, anyhow.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You take notes on it.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You write with your wiimote.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You just write your notes.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Scandal, scandal, scandal, scandal.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right, anyhow.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Happy Father's Day, also, to any dads that are listening to our program, as it is Father's Day today.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I know we have some daddy gamers, so congrats to all of you folks.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I hope you're having a great day.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, just wanted to get that out there.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's get into the show and talk about our gaming weeks.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Start off, Dark Sakura.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How was your gaming week?

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, I've been spending the whole week looking for my copy of Elite Beat Agents, because Dan wants to play it,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and playing some World of Warcraft, like hardly any, because I still want Burning Crusade so I can play a hot little elf.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Very cool.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You still haven't gotten Burning Crusade?

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What money do I have, Rob?

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't know.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You certainly don't get paid for this, so I don't know.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, I don't have much money, so no.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, sorry to hear it.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Unless someone in the chat room wants to buy it for me.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sell a pinball machine.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
They're not mine.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, okay.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They're the spouses.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I see.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Full of stuff.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Actually, I played, I tried to catch up on demos on Xbox Live, so I tried Overlord, and that was pretty fun.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I guess people keep comparing it to Fable, although I've never played Fable.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Surprising.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm going to play Fable 2, though, but haven't played the original Fable, so I guess it's similar to that, but it's kind of fun.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You get to control little gremlin things.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I just want to verify, because I haven't been reading up too much on Fable 2, you will still able to be a bisexual evil warlord, correct?

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, and you can get pregnant.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If I'm a male, that might be difficult.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, that might be difficult.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, but...

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So...

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That would be a real Fable right there.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There once was a pregnant man.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They definitely do not, like, I don't know, they blatantly ripped off gremlins.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, these creatures are so gremlin-like, they are gremlins.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Do they sing?

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, they do, and actually...

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's great.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And they can attack sheep, and that's what you have them do a lot, is attack things, and that's kind of cool.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And it's sort of like Fable, where you can be good and evil, except you have the choice of being evil or eviler.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I want to be uber evil.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So it's actually pretty cool.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The other game I played was Monster Madness, and now this game I was kind of looking forward to check out,

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
because it reminded me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and who doesn't like Zombies Ate My Neighbors?

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This game is no Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and it's awful.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The controls in it, awful, and it's way too damn hard, so I don't recommend it at all.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The other games I played, Mad Tracks, I actually tried that out a little bit, and that was pretty fun.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I played through a few levels of that, although there really isn't too much to the game.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can probably beat it pretty quick, so they're kind of trying to sell those additional add-ons for it.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know, not my thing.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Didn't play Pac-Man Championship Edition.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I looked at it, downloaded the demo, so I haven't played it yet.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But it's Pac-Man.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, I'm sorry, it's a sequel to Pac-Man.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have more to say on this, but I'll wait my turn.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, Dan downloaded that.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I was like, okay, what the hell?

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He was like, I came home, and all I was doing was freaking screaming at the ghosts.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Doesn't he do that all the time?

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He was really screaming at me.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He was calling them bastards.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was like, dude, you sound like me talking to my computer.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And then, I downloaded the Project Silphie demo today, but I forgot to play that.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I finished Super Paper Mario.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Congrats.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, the end is like, you saw it coming throughout the entire game, and it's just like, once

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you finish it, you're rewarded with, hey, guess what?

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't you fucking spoil it.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, I'm not going to spoil it.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm just saying, once you finish the game, you're rewarded with, hey, you get to go back

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
to this one level and fight a hundred people, and it'll take another couple hours.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Fuck you.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I mean, it's awful.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's what the whole game is, is full of this like, fight a hundred people, do that

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
for two hours.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, are you saying at the end of the game, you get told, we're sorry, Mario, but our

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
princess is in another castle?

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, it's more like...

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We're sorry, Mario, but your game sucks.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's more like, thank you for playing through the game, no replay value whatsoever, sell

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
it back to GameStop.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thank you very much.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So, that's pretty much what I'm going to have to do.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I did download Zelda 2.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't know why, but I've actually been playing this game.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can lend it to me before you sell it back.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can borrow my copy.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm not playing it.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you really want to play it, I'll lend you mine.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a great game.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's just, you know, after you've played through all of it, it's just kind of, eh.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's a bunch of side quests you can do that have no reward whatsoever.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What?

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Zelda 2?

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, not Zelda 2.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm talking about Super Mario.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No, Zelda 2 is awesome.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was like, Zelda 2 is fucking rad.

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't know why people diss it.

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
It's like one of the worst in the series.

164
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
It's great.

165
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
It's really fucking weird.

166
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Go play Wand of Gamelon if you want to see the worst ones in the series, okay?

167
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,120
It doesn't feel like Zelda at all.

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,760
It's just very strange, and I remember playing through it and it being very hard.

169
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,160
It still is kind of hard, but I don't know, I can understand it more.

170
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,440
Why did the name of everything really strange names is beyond me?

171
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
I am Error.

172
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Yeah, I remember that.

173
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
I went in and I'm like, oh, there's that.

174
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,000
I think that was actually supposed to have been something else, and it programmed in

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
wrong, if I remember right.

176
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Really?

177
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
With the translation.

178
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Huh.

179
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I want that on a shirt.

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
I am Error.

181
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,120
There's got to be a shirt somewhere.

182
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
I'm sure there is.

183
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,520
You can just have one made, you know.

184
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,840
Maybe his name is just Error.

185
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
I mean...

186
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm going to name my firstborn Error.

187
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,440
I mean, fucking look at that.

188
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,800
That would be a horrible thing for parents to do to name their baby Error.

189
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,000
With the middle name Oops.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,880
Error Oops Summers.

191
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,280
Love it.

192
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,800
Then finally, the last game I've been playing, and this is weird because I've actually played

193
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,320
this game more than I played Guitar Hero, but it uses the Guitar Hero controller for

194
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
the 360, and it's a game for the PC called Fret Nice.

195
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,320
The best way to describe it is it's like playing Loco Roco with a guitar, and it actually works

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
pretty well.

197
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,200
They've got some really interesting level designs and stuff.

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,480
The only bad thing about it is it's only three levels long, but it's a lot of fun, so I recommend

199
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
downloading that.

200
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,640
I may post a link to it in my blog on all games so that you can actually find it, because

201
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,560
it's on some foreign website or something, but it's cool, and it's free, so I highly

202
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,080
recommend doing that.

203
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I don't know.

204
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,540
I don't play the Guitar Hero.

205
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
It's weird.

206
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:34,600
We did this thing on Friday last week that it was basically the sales team building thing,

207
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,280
and we had to perform songs on stage, and they have video of it, but anyways, they had

208
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,080
like one person had the Air Guitar, so I had to do the Air Guitar part of it because I

209
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,520
didn't want to sing.

210
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,320
You know how my issues are with singing, so I did that, and everyone was like, oh, you're

211
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
so good at that.

212
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
Maybe it's because you play Guitar Hero all the time.

213
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,120
I'm like, I don't play Guitar Hero.

214
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
I bought the game.

215
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,760
I don't play it.

216
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,440
Everyone just has this weird, I don't know.

217
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,960
Because I own the game, they figure that I play it a lot or something, or because I'm

218
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:11,200
a gamer, oh, I must have played Guitar Hero a lot, or because you were on the internet

219
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
radio program about music video games.

220
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,600
Therefore you can pass every catastrophic in DDR in the group.

221
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,240
Back in the day, I wasn't so fat.

222
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,640
That's what it boils down to, because I played more DDR.

223
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
Exactly.

224
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,800
Then you get married, and you don't have DDR time, and it all goes downhill from there.

225
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,240
Anything else about your gaming week you want to share?

226
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Oh yeah, I played more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

227
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Congratulations.

228
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,600
I got my last copy of Saints Row, and so we're going to be landing those five systems together

229
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
very soon.

230
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Very cool.

231
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,960
Just in time for the sequel, maybe?

232
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,520
Saints Row 2, that's not coming down for a while, but hopefully in time for Grand Theft

233
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
Auto 4.

234
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,960
Actually, we know it's going to be in time for Grand Theft Auto 4, that's why we're building

235
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
it.

236
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
All right.

237
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Let's see, my gaming week.

238
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,240
I also played Pac-Man Championship Edition.

239
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
I was gone, obviously, for two weeks.

240
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I went to New York City, and actually I want to start off by giving a big shout out to

241
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
those folks that actually came and met up with me on Sunday.

242
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
About the time we would have usually done Orange on the Radio, I was hanging out with

243
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
some of our listeners in New York City, and that was a great time.

244
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
We actually went to Dave & Buster's in Times Square, and just kind of messed around there

245
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,080
a little for a little while, and played this game called Jumpin' Jackpot, which is hilarious.

246
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,520
They have one of these at Roseville Golf Land, actually it's the virtual jump rope with the

247
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,140
lights going around, and it plays this really super gay rave music while you're jumping.

248
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,100
But it's hard, and it's crack.

249
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,000
You keep putting money in over and over.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,720
And we played some DDR, they had Superdome, we were playing a bunch of stuff, and it was

251
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
a good time.

252
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,120
What are you laughing at?

253
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Did somebody link that in chat room?

254
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,640
Chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join the chat room.

255
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
What is this?

256
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
This is VG Cats?

257
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,280
No, Digital Unrest is what this is.

258
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,800
Sounds kind of like VG Cats, though.

259
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Link that in chat.

260
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Someone already did.

261
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,440
Oh, okay.

262
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Very nice.

263
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,980
Oh, because they actually had a baby.

264
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Very nice.

265
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
Yeah.

266
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
All right.

267
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,400
For those of you guys listening to us on the podcast, there's just more incentive to

268
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
listen live.

269
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,920
Digital Unrest comic.

270
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,320
Just search for the Error comic.

271
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
It's great.

272
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,960
Anyhow, damn it, you interrupted my story, woman.

273
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,320
Yes!

274
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Dave and Busters.

275
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
You know, I have enough tickets to buy an Xbox 360 game, but I'm just not interested

276
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,680
in anything that they have there.

277
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,960
Anyhow, so big thanks to all the listeners who showed up.

278
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,560
Also went, Ranma took me to this video game shop, or I think he was the one that led the

279
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
way.

280
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
I mean, all of us kind of went there.

281
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,160
All of us that were still together at this time.

282
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,880
We went to this video game shop near Astor Place, where the big cube is, and they had

283
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
like tons of stuff.

284
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,280
Like I sent you the picture of the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and all these import stuff, but

285
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,560
they were selling old school NES games, and my friend has an old school Nintendo.

286
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,640
The date Wednesday we set aside just to recuperate from Jetlag, I actually played through an

287
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,160
original Metroid cartridge all the way from start to finish.

288
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It was so awesome.

289
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
I love Metroid.

290
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,760
I forgot how much I missed that game, but I actually bought her a copy of the Guardian

291
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,520
Legend from this store that we found.

292
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Yeah, I got to push your propaganda on everybody.

293
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,760
$15 to buy that game.

294
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
They still don't.

295
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
That's not bad.

296
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Yeah, I know.

297
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,040
They're charging a lot for the old NES games now.

298
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,240
It's like they've gone up in value.

299
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
So it's very interesting.

300
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
Was it in the box?

301
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
No.

302
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,480
It was just the cart and the black slate.

303
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,400
When I bought mine, I paid $10, and I got it in the box.

304
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,240
But I got her an original cartridge of Guardian Legends.

305
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
That made me happy.

306
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,720
Completely unopened.

307
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
That's nice.

308
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Yeah, my Guardian Legend.

309
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,040
I opened it to play it, of course.

310
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,560
There you go.

311
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,040
So yeah, I got her a copy of Guardian Legend.

312
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,880
I should have just took it home with me, but I don't have an old school Nintendo here.

313
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm holding out hope they will put it on Virtual Console eventually.

314
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Rob!

315
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
What?

316
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Who do you know in this room who has five Nintendos?

317
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
Are you going to give me one?

318
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Probably.

319
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
I could.

320
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Sweet!

321
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Let me talk to Dan.

322
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,240
Then maybe I'm going to send Amanda back to that store and give me more games.

323
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,120
Just buy a Generation Next.

324
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,040
Oh yeah, we'll talk about that later in the show.

325
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,600
There's this other thing coming out I'll talk about later.

326
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Well, no.

327
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
It's already out.

328
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Well, isn't it on the show roll?

329
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
No.

330
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
It's not something else.

331
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,880
This is the thing we saw at E3 a few years back.

332
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Oh, that thing!

333
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
The $20 console thing.

334
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Sixty.

335
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Sixty?

336
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Sixty bucks.

337
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I thought they were only charging people $20.

338
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Was that just at the show?

339
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
That was at the show.

340
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
No, I see.

341
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
You should have bought it at the show.

342
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
What the hell?

343
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Oh well.

344
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,760
Anyhow, so yeah, obviously there was some 8-bit gaming goodness.

345
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Dave and Busters.

346
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,720
I finally caved and I got a DS Lite, which, by the way, I saw this story floating around

347
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,440
blogs this week talking about how Nintendo World has these custom DS Lites that you can

348
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,200
buy in all these different colors.

349
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,480
They wanted $280 for those, and the picture that's floating around doesn't show you all

350
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
the colors that they have.

351
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,080
I don't know if they added some or what because I distinctly remember there was a green one

352
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,600
because that's the one I wanted to get, and you don't see that one in the pictures that

353
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,560
made it around all the different game blogs.

354
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,960
Check DJ Rama's picture site, which I'm sure he'll link in chat right now.

355
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,480
I think it's djramas.net, and check out his New York City pictures.

356
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,360
He actually took a picture of the case with all the colors and some of the newer ones

357
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
that were in there.

358
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,280
It was between that and the fuchsia hot pink one.

359
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't remember what the fucking website is, but there is a website out there that

360
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,160
you can buy, custom colored anything, consoles, portable systems.

361
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,120
Two hundred and eighty bucks they wanted for that.

362
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,760
Well, you can buy it cheaper than that.

363
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:22,600
They sell iPods there, they sell PSPs, DS Lites, everything, and you can get them in

364
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
custom colors.

365
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm not sure about DS Lites, but I know they sold the original DS on the site.

366
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,640
People just forget that you can do that or just paint it.

367
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
I don't know.

368
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,960
You can just get a part and paint the damn thing.

369
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,040
They also do engraving there, and I almost bought my new DS Lite at the Nintendo World

370
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,000
Store to get it engraved, because they'll engrave your DS for only twenty bucks, and

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,760
there's all these patterns you can choose from, and I thought that was pretty awesome,

372
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,720
but their engraving machine was broken, so I didn't get to do it.

373
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Sucks to that.

374
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,800
Their engraving machine said I am error.

375
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,240
When I got to Pennsylvania, I was like, well, sales tax is lower here than it is in California.

376
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,160
I was so bored in Pennsylvania, I have to be honest.

377
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,480
No offense to those of you folks that live in the Allentown area where I was at for a

378
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,600
few days, but Lehigh Valley, all that stuff, I was really bored.

379
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,600
So I bought a DS Lite, and I bought Puzzle Quest.

380
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,520
Oh my God, that game is amazing.

381
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,240
It is so addicting.

382
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,720
It's simple, it's just bejeweled, but the whole fact that they threw this competitive

383
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,400
element into it, where you're taking turns, you really have to think about the game a

384
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
whole new way.

385
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,040
You can't just go, oh, I'm going to line this up, I'm going to line this up, I'm going to

386
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
make a chain, make a chain.

387
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,520
Because you have to line things up, and you don't want your opponent, who's going to go

388
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,000
after you, to be able to line up the skulls.

389
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Because basically, to explain the game real fast, there's a story that all goes with it.

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,800
You can cast spells, which are like special moves on the board, but to do that requires

391
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
mana.

392
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,640
And so the stones on the board are red, yellow, blue, and green.

393
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,400
And then you also have gold coins, purple experience stars, and skulls.

394
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
When you line up the coins, you get gold.

395
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,660
When you line up the experience stars, you get experience, so you can level up.

396
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,840
When you line up the skulls, your opponent takes damage.

397
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,000
So it sounds kind of complicated, but if you play Bejeweled, you can pick this game up.

398
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,940
And just the fact that they kind of threw that whole twist into it really was innovative.

399
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,000
It made the game a lot of fun.

400
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,960
So I totally love Puzzle Quest, and I hope they come out with it on Xbox Live Arcade.

401
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,360
I hope those rumors are true.

402
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,640
Also I picked up Planet Puzzle League, but I haven't played enough of that just yet to

403
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,840
really play, to give it a fair response.

404
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,600
But I played it once, and I know it's very similar, of course, to Pokemon Puzzle League,

405
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
but with some new stuff.

406
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,440
You totally reminded me of the other game I was playing.

407
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
What's that?

408
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Pokemans!

409
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Oh, Pearl and Diamond?

410
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Or what do you have, Diamond?

411
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
I have Pearl.

412
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Oh, Pearl?

413
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Because I'm being not like everybody else.

414
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
I have Pearl, too.

415
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Bah!

416
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
You're being like me.

417
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Bah!

418
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Yourself.

419
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
No, I'm being different.

420
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
All right, that's fine.

421
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Are you having fun with your Pokemans?

422
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
At the gym, yes.

423
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Right, cool.

424
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
I've learned the fine art of playing Pokemans on the elliptical.

425
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,080
That's a good idea.

426
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
It's very hard.

427
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
I've been playing Pokemans a lot of times.

428
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,880
Let's see, then also I played Pac-Man Championship Edition, which I thought was great, but the

429
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,400
only thing that made me mad about it is that the original Pac-Man that came out a few months

430
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,280
ago for five bucks, totally worthless now, unless you really want the authentic arcade

431
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
experience.

432
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,720
Pac-Man CE is really, like, really, ultimately, the two of them should have been released

433
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,960
together for ten bucks, and that would have been the most fair deal, I think.

434
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,680
If you want the authentic Pac-Man arcade experience, go buy Pac-Man arcade machine.

435
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,000
They're probably cheap now.

436
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Not really.

437
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Really?

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Are they, like, hot collector's items?

439
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,240
You can find them at, um, well, in the Sacramento, Roseville area.

440
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
You can find them at DiDio's.

441
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,800
There's a guy that sells arcade machines.

442
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,460
But hundreds or thousands of dollars for an arcade machine, or five bucks on Xbox Live

443
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,260
for pretty much the next best thing.

444
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,260
I don't know.

445
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Hard to tell.

446
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,200
I want to see Xbox Live arcades in an arcade.

447
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,840
Well, anyway, Pac-Man, I liked Pac-Man Ship, or Pac-Man Championship Edition a lot.

448
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,640
I think the game is set up great.

449
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,240
Really, it's weird, because you eat the dots, and when all the dots are gone on one half

450
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,080
of the screen, a fruit shows up on the other side of the screen, and when you eat the fruit,

451
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
more dots appear.

452
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,940
So you're kind of, like, ping-ponging to both sides of the screen.

453
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,200
It's really trippy, and it's got a pretty interesting rave-y soundtrack.

454
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,400
What is up with Namco and the rave-y soundtrack games?

455
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,080
Namco made that flaming finger game at Dave & Buster's.

456
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,560
They made the jump and jackpot game.

457
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,920
Namco is, like, there's rave whores that work, like, they're all on ecstasy over there or

458
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
something.

459
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
So, whatever.

460
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,040
Now, Pac-Man Championship Edition, and also I played Prince of Persia Classic.

461
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
The game looks beautiful.

462
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,360
I mean, the way they redid the graphics, that's the best rehash of the graphics of any game

463
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,440
on Xbox Live Arcade, but I didn't end up buying the whole game, because I've played Prince

464
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,240
of Persia Classic just so many times, I really wasn't interested in playing through it again.

465
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,960
The game can get so frustrating at some points, but it's definitely worth checking out the

466
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,520
demo, and if you've never played the Classic game before, it's probably worth a look for

467
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
a chance.

468
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,080
If I remember Prince of Persia, I remember it was fucking hard, and I got frustrated

469
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,800
with it really quickly.

470
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,000
Checking out the chat room, www.orangelandsradio.com, click on chat, or you can go directly to chat.orangelandsradio.com,

471
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,920
we tape live on Sunday nights.

472
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,040
Let's see, BlackDevilerX agrees with Loki's, I want to see Xbox Live Arcade in an arcade.

473
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,020
I think it'd be cool, they should.

474
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,100
TheRobD says, I hate flaming finger, and Jvmon says, flaming finger told Skye to get his

475
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
flame on.

476
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,120
That's right, you know the game said, when you start the game, have you played flaming

477
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,320
finger, Dave & Buster's?

478
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,960
I watched you play it.

479
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,520
I didn't even shake you.

480
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,680
You're playing footsie with my hand.

481
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,640
Whenever you put your money in the game, whatever it says, get your flame on, which is really

482
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,840
funny, because I'm gay, and you know, they say flaming or whatever.

483
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:43,920
Anyway, let's see, looking at what else is going on in chat room, Gerardimo says, Pokemon

484
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,960
Puzzle League sucked because it had no Yoshi, making a reference to the old school Tetris

485
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Attack.

486
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,960
GS68 points out there's a Ms. Pac-Man machine at Miggle, Milpitas Golf Land, a very infamous

487
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,080
arcade here in California.

488
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,000
BlackBoy says, I think I need the Fuchsia DS Lite.

489
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,960
So, that's almost a flaming DS Lite right there.

490
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,840
Alright, well, that sounds like it's about it for our gaming weeks, so let's get into

491
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,920
some housekeeping real, real quick, and then we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

492
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
Not a whole lot of housekeeping.

493
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,040
Next week is our fifth anniversary show, and I know, crazy, huh?

494
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,020
We're going to keep exactly what we're doing somewhat under wraps until the show comes

495
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,400
next week, basically because we still haven't figured it out completely, but all we can

496
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,880
say is that it'll definitely be very us, no matter what we end up doing.

497
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,960
It's definitely going to be very us.

498
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:43,680
Alright, also, we wanted to say a happy 100th episode to Bobby, because he had his 100th

499
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,240
episode tonight, so congrats to Bobby Blackwolf, our friend over at AllGames.com.

500
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,880
Speaking of AllGames.com, you can always hear the rebroadcast of our program over there.

501
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,720
Monday nights at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time, they replay our show.

502
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,280
It's A and B back to back, so sometimes you have to wait for part B on the podcast or

503
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,020
audio blog feed for a little while.

504
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,240
They replay it over there Monday nights and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific Standard

505
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,380
Time.

506
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,080
Let's get into some gaming news.

507
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,680
We obviously missed a week last week, so, Loki, tell us about what we missed.

508
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,280
Uh, well, some stuff.

509
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,760
I guess the Halo 3 beta ended, so everybody's sad because they have to wait for the Halo

510
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,000
3 actual game to come out, but, you know, hey, whatever.

511
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
They got a good turnout.

512
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,960
Apparently, Bungie was saying that they've clocked so many hours of Halo 3 that they

513
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,680
could have, if they were to create, I guess, one-on-one games using the same amount of

514
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,720
time in that beta, they would have 700 years worth of gameplay, so...

515
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,120
Go analysts!

516
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,160
Anyways, other rumors, I played it twice.

517
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,640
I played it once, I beat you.

518
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:58,520
So Parappa 3 rumored to be coming to the PS3, and this, of course, is coming from EGM.

519
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,760
No other information on that other than it's rumored.

520
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,240
I think that's kind of saying, like, duh.

521
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,720
Prince of Persia, the movie, it's going to be coming out July 10th, 2009.

522
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,820
Everybody's excited because it's going to be very Pirates of the Caribbean-like, so

523
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,520
hurrah.

524
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,620
Another updated, or upgraded graphic version of Metal Gear Solid 4's Tokyo Game Show

525
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:30,840
trailer has made it online with a little interesting bit that's missing towards the end.

526
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,360
Some people will notice that the PlayStation 3 logo is missing at the very end of the trailer.

527
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Here we go again.

528
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
It's coming to the 360!

529
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I swear to God, this game is coming to the 360!

530
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,360
This game is coming to the 360!

531
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,960
Why aren't you people listening to me?

532
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,440
Oh my God.

533
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,080
People are going crazy.

534
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,740
Anyways, shut up!

535
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,600
When they're ready to announce it on the 360, they will announce it, and yes, they probably

536
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,320
will, but keep your pants on in the meantime, God.

537
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:07,040
And next being announced, coming to film ultra-generic video game movie 4, in other words, City of

538
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:14,420
Heroes is going to be adapted to film and TV, because I don't know, it's just a parody

539
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,120
of all the other superhero things out there.

540
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,440
Sure, generic superhero movie, that'd be awesome.

541
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,360
Then Myst is coming to the DS, hurrah.

542
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,400
Lego MMO coming in 2008, that's awesome.

543
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:34,900
Tomb Raider anniversary edition, because you know, Tomb Raider is so fucking awesome, woohoo.

544
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,320
It's actually coming to the 360, possibly as download content, this is coming from ratings,

545
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,320
found on the ESRB's website, and people are thinking that's going to be download content,

546
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,120
possibly for Tomb Raider Legends, don't care.

547
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,680
And Pac-Man Championship Edition was released for the 360, and I guess it's the first actual

548
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,800
sequel to Pac-Man, although I do remember there's like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Junior

549
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:11,520
Pac-Man, Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, Pac-Man Jr. though was admittedly harder because it had the scrolling

550
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
screen.

551
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,120
And it just kind of sucked, generally, it wasn't a Pac-Man or Junior Pac-Man.

552
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,240
What the fuck about Super Pac-Man, that game was completely different than Pac-Man, listen,

553
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,680
it's new, okay, sorry, this is coming from the people that know Pac-Man, the people that

554
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
made it.

555
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,240
Look, this is the first Pac-Man with raving, I'll give it that, this is the first Ravealicious

556
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,520
Pac-Man game, that's what it's got.

557
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,200
Guess what, you fucking bought Pac-Man again, you suck, you stupid bastard, and guess what,

558
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,240
Nintendo has another fucking Game Boy to throw at you too, dumbass, fuck, anyway, so yeah,

559
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,160
it came out, hooray, 10 bucks, I didn't buy it, but no, I did, I'm taking my shit, a lot

560
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,280
of people on my friends list did do it, a lot of people bought it.

561
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,520
Guess what, and then when the next Namco fucking collection comes out, there will be Pac-Man

562
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,720
in that too, and when the next console comes out, there will be another Pac-Man game, because

563
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,440
people buy Pac-Man.

564
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,040
You're sighing, Jamie, why are you sighing?

565
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,960
Getting ready to shoot myself in the head.

566
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,760
Why, from all the Pac-Man, Pac-Man overload, if you put the bullet in the right place,

567
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,960
you might have a little triangular shaped hole there, and then you would be actually

568
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Ms. Pac-Man.

569
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Where's Jigglypuff?

570
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,440
Uh, let's see, Banda in our chat room says, I want a Pac-Man MMORPG.

571
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
No!

572
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,400
What the hell would you do in a Pac-Man MMO?

573
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Pac-Man eating shit.

574
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Did you not play Pac-Man World?

575
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,240
No, it'd be like, it'd be like the Pac-Man family from the cartoon.

576
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,920
Oh yeah, and there was that side-scrolling Pac-Man game, what the fuck, isn't that a

577
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
sequel?

578
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,640
Remember, at Classic Gaming Expo, I bought that.

579
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
You did?

580
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,240
I bought it for the TurboGrafx.

581
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
You sucker.

582
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,040
But, it was the only copy that I have.

583
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,760
Oh, okay, well that makes it all of them.

584
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Oh, well, okay.

585
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
It's Pac-Land.

586
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
It was Pac-Land.

587
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,160
I remember playing Pac-Land, I'm like, oh, Pac-Land, this is gonna be interesting, because

588
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,960
it's not Pac-Man, it's Pac-Land.

589
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
I played it, I'm like, wow, this sucks.

590
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,680
Stupid mame, making me play crappy games, because I don't know what they are, and then

591
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,440
you went back to Ms. World 96 Nude.

592
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,800
No, all you have to do, if ever you want the ultimate mame experience, you just play Blazing

593
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Star.

594
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,480
All right, I have to introduce our special guest tonight, who came in a little bit late

595
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,880
there while Loki was doing his story, but this is your first time in the studio, right?

596
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,600
I think the last time I went here was in 2005 May.

597
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,920
You're old school.

598
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,640
Right after Phantom May of 2005.

599
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
Let's tell them who you are.

600
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,240
What's your name, what's your online name, where might we have seen you before?

601
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,960
Okay, my name is Jonas Casarino, or also known as Explicit.

602
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I think some of you guys heard me a long time ago.

603
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Old school.

604
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
Our F.U. of the Week god.

605
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,280
Oh god, that's right, he likes to give the F.U.s the week that go on all day.

606
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,000
But that's all right, we'll let you get to it.

607
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,440
What kind of stuff do you do out there in the community?

608
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,320
Right now, SacAnime has got me part of...

609
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
I'll be there.

610
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Oh, you will be there?

611
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,880
I'll be one of the head people of the gaming area.

612
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,280
I'll be cosplaying.

613
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,540
Cool, as what?

614
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,200
Sexy Nojuku Iruka.

615
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,160
Sexy isn't it?

616
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,400
I know where people are going to know you from, Explicit, is your cosplay from Fanime

617
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
this year, which is actually when I told you.

618
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That was the greatest ever.

619
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,080
Because when I ran into you, I said, you need to come back on the show.

620
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,680
Tell them what you cosplayed as, it was awesome.

621
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:33,240
Okay, for those who did not go to Fanime Con, I was the one who dressed up as the Weemote.

622
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,560
We saw you walking by when we were heading back to the hotel room, we were like, dude,

623
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
is that a Weemote?

624
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,000
I said to someone, I was like, that's explicit, remember him when he used to come on the show?

625
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,680
You weren't there, I was walking...

626
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,320
I was with somebody, it might have been Ramu or somebody, I was like, that's explicit.

627
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Oh, was it you, Matt?

628
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Maybe that's it.

629
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
Alright, that's what it was.

630
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,720
Alright, but anyway, so now you're back, and so we were able to exchange numbers and everything,

631
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,280
get you back here on the program to give some more FUs, so feel free to chime in throughout

632
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
the night.

633
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
What kind of games have you been playing recently?

634
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Any Wii games?

635
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,480
Well, since I have a Wii, yep, WarioWare, I'd like to try to get someone to play drunk

636
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,800
WarioWare on that.

637
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,280
Mmm, there's an idea for the fifth anniversary.

638
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Alright.

639
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,840
And let's, yeah, um, let's see, I've been playing Planet Puzzle League lately, since

640
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:21,000
I've been trying to get, trying to master all these puzzle games lately.

641
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
What do you think of it?

642
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
It was actually pretty difficult just to master itself, it's a lot harder than like Tetris

643
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,160
or Luminous in which...

644
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,480
I bought it, but I've only played it once, so.

645
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,040
Yeah, but I've just seen that insane video that someone sent me a while ago, it was like

646
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
33X combo.

647
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Dang.

648
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
Yeah.

649
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Is that on YouTube somewhere?

650
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
I might have to check that out.

651
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah, it's on YouTube somewhere.

652
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Huh.

653
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Have you played Puzzle Quest?

654
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Because I was raving about that earlier in the show.

655
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Puzzle Quest is great.

656
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
I have not played that yet.

657
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,420
It's like, if you like role-playing games, you like puzzle games, they made this game

658
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,420
for you.

659
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,720
Seriously, they put a little bow on it and said, here, here it is.

660
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
Is it for DS?

661
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Just for you.

662
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,640
For DS, PSP, and supposedly Xbox Live Arcade, I remember us doing a story that it's coming

663
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,220
to Xbox Live Arcade, but seriously, just get the DS, or PSP, actually, I have a friend,

664
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,520
this is the PSP version, looks a lot better.

665
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,120
I haven't seen it myself yet, I'm content with the DS one, but, I don't know.

666
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
We'll see what happens.

667
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Take your poison.

668
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,940
Alright, anyway, so explicit, ladies and gentlemen, is here, so feel free to chime in whenever

669
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,940
you like.

670
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,520
But, we need to get to this week's news, so, Loki, if you wouldn't mind starting us off

671
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,600
with a little piece of the news from this week.

672
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,720
Yes, a piece of the news.

673
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,600
And of course, you know, if you've been listening to All Games, you probably heard about it,

674
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,760
but Sony has officially announced the agency for PC and the PS3.

675
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,880
It's going to be a brand new spy-themed MMO, not exactly spy versus spy, but it's still

676
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,160
pretty awesome, and yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.

677
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,280
And I don't know, we don't know.

678
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,660
Is it, Loki?

679
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,880
Is it going to be cool?

680
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
How do you know?

681
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
How do I know?

682
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Because the screenshots look cool.

683
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,280
I mean, you've got two people firing guns at a bunch of people with guns.

684
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,920
I mean, that's all you need is guns and people firing guns.

685
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
I mean, seriously.

686
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
No, no, no, no, no.

687
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,040
And he has a parachute.

688
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Is there fire?

689
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,720
Yes or no?

690
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,240
There's gunfire, muzzle flash, I mean.

691
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
I don't know.

692
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,640
That little spot on the ground looks like it might be fire.

693
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm sure it's got fire, but I don't know, it looks pretty cool.

694
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:27,360
As long as it's not like, you know, she spies or something like that.

695
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
You are so random.

696
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,040
No, wait, doesn't this hook up with the PC, like it's like Shadowrun or something?

697
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
I thought I heard something about that.

698
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
I think it's the hook up.

699
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,400
No, seriously, can't you play with the PC people?

700
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,480
Well, it's an MMO, so I would imagine so.

701
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,000
Is it across the two platforms, or is it that they're just separate entities?

702
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
I got the impression you could play across both platforms.

703
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
I believe it's cross platforms.

704
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Like Shadowrun.

705
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
I mean, it should.

706
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,080
I mean, the PS3 is fucking supposed to be powerful enough to run this shit, so why couldn't

707
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
they do cross platform?

708
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
I would think it is.

709
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,760
It's not like live, you know, where it's their own self-contained network.

710
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,680
It's Sony, do whatever, yeah.

711
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,420
Okay, I was gone and I was a bad boy and didn't stay up too much on my gaming news, so my

712
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,920
question to you would be, based on what you've read about this, is this the ace in the hole

713
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,820
that Sony needed to really kind of get a lot of momentum in the next-gen wars that are

714
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
going on right now?

715
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,320
Nope, because this game will probably not be out this year, that would be my guess.

716
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
So it's something like, you know, here's something to wait for.

717
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,440
It's just like Killzone 2, ooh, Killzone 2 is coming next year, so I mean, great, that's

718
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,460
awesome that it's coming next year, but we're talking now.

719
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,880
That's just like saying, you know, back when the 360 launched, ooh, but the PlayStation

720
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,440
3 is coming out.

721
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,640
Well, goodie for them, but it's not out right now, so, you know, it's just like, you know,

722
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,960
I'm gonna, well I'm gonna bring my friends, they're gonna beat you up, so meh.

723
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Um, going to the chat room and looking at the comments there, Bandit says, I'd rather

724
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,560
play a She-Ra video game other than that.

725
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,800
Dude, I bet a She-Ra game would be great.

726
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,600
Gosh, a She-Ra game would be pretty fucking badass.

727
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,420
It's like uber-barbarian chickly.

728
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,320
And hopefully the little wizard guy's hidden somewhere in it.

729
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,280
GS68 says, PlayStation 3, gimmicks, gimmicks, gimmicks.

730
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,680
And that was Madam Raz.

731
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,520
And RawSteelUT follows that right up by saying, not as gimmicky as the Wii, oh snap.

732
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,720
BlackDevilerX says, great, that'll give the PS3 another game.

733
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,160
And RawSteelUT's also rolling his eyes going, ew, cross-platform, ew.

734
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,780
I heard the cross-platform so far, you know, with Shadowrun's kind of not working.

735
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,880
I don't want to give the definitive review on the game because I have not played it.

736
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm not going to attempt to review a game based on screenshots alone, but word on the

737
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,420
street around my blogs and things of that nature is that Shadowrun sucks.

738
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,480
And I, I don't know, I won't...

739
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,120
What do you expect when you turn like a really awesome role-playing game and turn it into

740
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
a multiplayer only...

741
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,160
I fucking hate multiplayer only, you know, games out there.

742
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,680
That is retarded.

743
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,760
I don't want to play multiplayer games all the time.

744
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,680
Sometimes I'm in the mood for it, sometimes I'm not.

745
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,600
Okay, Psycoon's making angry face in chat says, Shadowrun fucking rocks.

746
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
So maybe...

747
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,560
It rocks, but it would have rocked even more as a fucking RPG, like it should be because

748
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
it's a RPG.

749
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,160
That would be, you know, a game that you can do like from FASTA or something that would

750
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,480
be good, just multiplayer only would be MechWarrior or something like that.

751
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,480
How did we get from talking about PlayStation 3's Ace and the whole game to talking about

752
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,880
Shadowrun?

753
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,380
Because they're cross-platform games.

754
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,680
Do we talk about the 360 too much on this program, maybe on, oh yeah, they are both

755
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
cross-platform games.

756
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
It's because it's awesome.

757
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,480
Okay, well, if you want to talk about cross-platform games that suck, Marvel Trading Card Game

758
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,200
on PSP and cross-platform with the PC.

759
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Okay.

760
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Woo-wee.

761
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Okay, fair enough.

762
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I guess we can all agree on that.

763
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
There you go.

764
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
All right, help.

765
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Save us from this debate, DarkSakura.

766
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Silent Hill 5.

767
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Ooh, yes.

768
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
You got my attention.

769
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,520
Might have a US developer, but it could happen, it could not happen, so we don't know.

770
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,200
They're like, it could happen, but it could not, so we don't know.

771
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Again, rumor.

772
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Can we do something else now?

773
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,560
I fucking hate stories like that.

774
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,200
No offense, Jamie, because I know you're just reading what is...

775
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I didn't pick it out.

776
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
I know.

777
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I know you're just reading what...

778
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Someone picked this like they picked their nose.

779
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,000
I know you're just reading what all the video game blogs are reporting on this week, which

780
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,520
is fine, but this is not news.

781
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
This is not news.

782
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,520
La, la, la.

783
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,080
I could hear once.

784
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Really?

785
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:40,200
I mean, we all know that Silent Hill 5 is coming out soon, but to hear that it might

786
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,120
have a developer that might be doing this with it, how is that news?

787
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,800
That's even better, is it may or may not.

788
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,040
Wow, thank you for covering all sides of possibilities right there, because there were only two.

789
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
It may or may not.

790
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,280
It's sorted us.

791
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:03,840
I mean, you can't have like, it's, you can't have 50% on that.

792
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,480
They're a US developer that's right on the border of Mexico or something like that.

793
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,680
They're built on the border, so half of them are Mexican, half of them are in the US, so

794
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,360
it's halfway true.

795
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,200
No, it's being done by the Hawaiian division.

796
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Which closed.

797
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
No, it's not.

798
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,880
They all got sent out to sea, didn't you hear?

799
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,080
Well, no wonder why the game's not going to get finished.

800
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Exactly.

801
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,080
It's like sent to Hawaii, some guy's like, what the fuck is this?

802
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,000
Pyramid Head went snorkeling, you'll just have to deal.

803
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,920
Silent Hill, Xtreme Beach Volleyball.

804
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,220
You know, if this is, dude, the nurses are pretty hot, actually.

805
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,180
You know, if this is what the news is going to be like this week, then seriously, Orange

806
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,520
Lounge Radio has been preempted this week for the Dead or Alive movie discussion.

807
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,440
Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.

808
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,760
How did I actually watch that?

809
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
See?

810
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Street Fighter II movie.

811
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Anyhow.

812
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,540
That movie was all about Kylie Minogue.

813
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,000
That movie killed Raul Julia.

814
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,680
It was his last movie, that's true.

815
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
It killed him.

816
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,000
He could have had- Not even the life support suit could bring

817
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
him back.

818
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,520
He could have had even more years left, and that movie is just like, ugh, ugh, ugh.

819
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
He didn't even go- That's so rude.

820
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
He didn't even go Psycho Crusher once.

821
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,600
Didn't he have an HBO movie, actually?

822
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Like that didn't count.

823
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,640
That was a movie that was Clint Eastwood, wasn't it?

824
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,120
Yeah, I just bought The Addams Family on DVD right before I left for New York.

825
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,280
That's Raul Julia at his finest.

826
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
That's how I prefer to remember him.

827
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,580
The Addams Family is fucking awesome.

828
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,080
And Addams Family values.

829
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh, and then SSJ-100 Matt comes up with the perfect witty retort that only our chat room

830
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,880
can come up with.

831
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,320
Pyramid Head snorkels and gets taken out by a stingray barb.

832
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,000
That's just lovely.

833
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Too soon.

834
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Too soon.

835
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
No, no, no.

836
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,400
Pyramid Head would probably just poke the thing with his big pointy head.

837
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
You know what?

838
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Seriously, I don't have to work tomorrow.

839
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm gonna go get some liquor, I think.

840
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
That's my help.

841
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
That's my help me through tonight's show.

842
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
That doesn't help me through tonight's show, Bob.

843
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
You want some?

844
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,360
I'm trying to know something very disappointing.

845
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,120
I went to go get some root beer, you know, the nice root beer, and it fucking wasn't

846
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
there.

847
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
Nice root beer.

848
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
No, not that.

849
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
That's diet shit.

850
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
Diet is never nice.

851
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,920
So, all they have is fucking vanilla cream.

852
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,120
I fucking hate cream soda.

853
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I hate it.

854
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Hate it.

855
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Hate it.

856
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Hate it.

857
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,760
Was there a video game show here once, or was it just me?

858
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
Root beer tapper.

859
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,680
See, it ties in.

860
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,840
I am not deviating from the show's plan.

861
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,120
I am talking about video games, or at least one step into video games.

862
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,000
Alright, I'm gonna read this story so I can go get some booze.

863
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Here it is.

864
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Let's see.

865
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,160
Oh, this is actually, this is real news, actually.

866
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,080
Sony finally got themselves an official blog.

867
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,080
Let's give Sony a round of applause.

868
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:01,120
Congratulations, Sony, you finally caught on, and you got yourselves a blog.

869
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,080
You finally figured out, hey, maybe that Major Nelson.

870
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,240
You know, he seems to stay in touch with the community pretty good.

871
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,640
Xbox 360 seems to know what they're doing with the community.

872
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,920
Nintendo, they have Reggie.

873
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,080
Very likable, very personable guy.

874
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,400
Maybe Ken Kudaragi, Crayon Eater.

875
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,920
So what can we do?

876
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,380
So they finally launched a blog.

877
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,560
Good job, Sony.

878
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,280
And you can read it for yourself, blog.us.playstation.com.

879
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
And look at this.

880
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,960
At least this one's not faking the B.A., like an independent blog, like, was it that all

881
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,840
I want for Christmas is a PSP shit?

882
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,040
Yeah, this is actually fairly well done.

883
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,240
I mean, this is really what I think folks have been asking for.

884
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,040
There's some articles here, they're pretty honest.

885
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,000
This guy who is the U.S. producer for MotorStorm is talking about the patch and how the 1.2

886
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,320
is going to have this time attack mode, and then talking about how, like, there's a bug

887
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,320
in the game.

888
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,760
There was another post that's talking about the PS3 firmware update 1.81.

889
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,600
And they kind of have, like, a buffet of people, so to speak, writing for it.

890
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,380
And it's actually not bad.

891
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,040
So good job, Sony.

892
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,040
They're a little late in getting here, but, you know, I guess it was worth waiting for,

893
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,240
so fair enough.

894
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
Better late than never.

895
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
I guess.

896
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
That's very true.

897
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,120
Well, one thing that's better late than never, well, I guess it's not good for Sony, but

898
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:22,760
apparently people have already begun cracking the PlayStation firmwares.

899
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,240
And this is probably no thanks to the fact that the PlayStation 3 software development

900
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,440
kit got leaked a couple weeks ago out on the internet.

901
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,840
So yeah, that only helps things along.

902
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:42,160
But they've started with actually allowing, apparently versions 1.1 and 1.11 of the PS3

903
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,880
firmwares can now access, I guess, burnt game ISOs where you can, it'll recognize burnt

904
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,960
games, but it won't play them yet.

905
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,240
So I guess that's the first step in getting backwards compatibility with some burnt games

906
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,400
or possibly, I don't know, piracy, lots of pirated games, or homebrew.

907
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,560
But right now, you know, nothing's coming of it, but, you know, they're working on it.

908
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,720
But Sony has this to say about it.

909
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,680
They don't like the fact that people want to put homebrew and pirate things on the PS3,

910
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,600
so they have basically threatened people and said, unfortunately hackers will try to exploit

911
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,240
any hardware system software.

912
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,680
The best we can do as a company is to make our security that much stronger and aggressively

913
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,760
pursue legal action against anyone caught trying to use an exploit in a legal manner.

914
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,800
Naturally, any use of an exploit on the system software does void the warranty on your PlayStation

915
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:51,640
3 system, which could be a costly mistake to see if you can run an old Sega CD game

916
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
on it.

917
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,440
I don't think anyone's going to try to run an old Sega CD game, ever.

918
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,880
I would, but then again, I have old Sega CD games.

919
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,480
But you know, and they claim that they're serious, which means that they're in serious

920
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
trouble because...

921
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,240
They're not going to be able to do crap!

922
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,320
If the PS3 is so easy to crack this long, how many fucking updates have there been to

923
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,880
the damn firmware?

924
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,300
I mean, it's only a matter of time before they crack it, so.

925
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,880
If you know you're not interested in going online and stuff, I would recommend keeping

926
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,960
your firmware as low as possible, if you're interested in that piracy stuff.

927
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,560
As far as homebrew, though, I mean, hello, you can install Linux on it.

928
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,480
I mean, if you want to play old SNES games, you can fucking put it on Yellow Dog Linux,

929
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,480
so who cares?

930
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
Yay.

931
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Well, I have better news than that.

932
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,040
This is happy news because I love the 80s.

933
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,960
Guitar Hero Encore has more tracks listed, which is, like, super happy.

934
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,000
So we have Hold On Loosely, that was, well, all of these, but one that I'm going to name

935
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,040
was a cover, so the one that's not a cover is The Warrior by Scandal.

936
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,520
Now the covers are Hold On Loosely from 38 Special, No One Like You by The Scorpions,

937
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,120
Only Aladdin, Oingo Boingo, it's a cool song, Radar Love by White Lion, Ballroom Blitz by

938
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,680
Crocus, a great name.

939
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,840
Dude, Ballroom Blitz is awesome.

940
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,480
I know, I like this song, I just always laugh at the band's name.

941
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,000
Well, Like About You by The Romantics, and Wrath of Child by Iron Maiden, because Iron

942
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,120
Maiden's fucking awesome.

943
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:33,600
And others on the list, 18 in Life, Bathroom Wall, Lonely is the Night, Nothing But a Good

944
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,000
Time, dude, Poison, Play With Me, Shaken, dude, I love Eddie, but it's like my favorite

945
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,960
Eddie Munny song ever.

946
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,040
Synchronicity 2, I Want to Rock, I Ran, of course, The Block of Seagulls, it's the actual

947
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:54,240
song too, so is the Twisted Sister one, Round and Round, I Want Candy, Metal Health, Holy

948
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,160
Diver, sorry, and Heat of the Moment.

949
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,240
Are you excited about Guitar Heroes Rock Series?

950
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Hell yeah!

951
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,980
I love my 80s rock.

952
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,280
So I went to go make some liquor, which I don't have a lot to pick from because I didn't

953
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,320
stock up before tonight's show.

954
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,320
I mixed Malibu rum and root beer, how do you think that's going to turn out?

955
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Give me.

956
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Wait, I haven't tried it yet.

957
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
You want to try it first?

958
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
Alright, try that.

959
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,400
Don't spill it on your laptop, for God's sake.

960
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,080
Some bizarre shit that tastes like Dr. Pepper, which is nasty.

961
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
Really?

962
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,400
Everything tastes like Dr. Pepper when you mix it with alcohol.

963
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,880
Let me try this.

964
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,400
It kind of does taste like Dr. Pepper, it's not too bad.

965
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,320
Well, I hate Dr. Pepper, so I'm finishing off my root beer.

966
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Dr. Pepper says that was a combination of everything.

967
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,480
You want to know what's still in my fridge, by the way, Rob?

968
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,240
The bottle of pineapple Malibu from Fauna Mae.

969
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
Delicious.

970
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,560
I think DevilerX wants to know, Sky, what kind of root beer?

971
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,560
It's Diet IBC.

972
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,560
Ew.

973
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,560
There we go.

974
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,280
Alright, so I mixed it with Malibu, because that's all I had.

975
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,520
I had that and citrus vodka, and I knew that would be really bad.

976
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
You should mix with vodka and the Malibu.

977
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,520
We'll see, we'll see.

978
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,160
Drink that like a shot.

979
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,920
Can I do a video game story, please?

980
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
No.

981
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,920
Okay.

982
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Alright.

983
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,160
Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the Playstation 3, not that you may have heard that somewhere

984
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,680
before, where it was soon after retracted, but we can officially, with permission, tell

985
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,340
you now that Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the Playstation 3 with a GunCon controller,

986
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:29,700
and of course, Famitsu, they were the first to break this news about Time Crisis 4 coming

987
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,920
to the Playstation 3.

988
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,560
You hadn't heard it anywhere before then.

989
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,800
The Playstation 3 version will have an arcade mode, and it's just going to be just like

990
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,440
the arcade game, which is pretty awesome.

991
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,420
So if you like Time Crisis, you're going to be really excited about this game, I'm sure.

992
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,240
There is a GunCon controller that's coming out with this, which is kind of ugly.

993
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,520
It's orange, and kind of looks like the Zapper.

994
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,760
Not as ugly as the dude holding it, dude.

995
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,760
That guy is fugly.

996
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,760
That's cool, though.

997
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,400
I was reading that they're going to have first person shooter portions of the game.

998
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,880
That's why the GunCon's so weird looking.

999
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,020
That's kind of cool, though.

1000
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,640
And apparently, they're going to have, it functions like the Wii.

1001
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,680
You put these things on the left and right side of your TV, kind of like how on the Wii

1002
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:14,360
you have the LED bar, and then there's a camera inside the actual gun, and that determines

1003
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,280
where the markers are at.

1004
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,080
So that means, that way you can use the GunCon, whether you have an LCD, a plasma, whatever.

1005
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,920
It'll work on any type of TV, which is good news.

1006
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,440
What's kind of neat, though, and I mean, how many GunCon games are out there?

1007
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,780
I mean, really not that many.

1008
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:35,600
I think that this would be awesome for first person shooters, because you've got, basically,

1009
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,280
on the front grip of the gun, you have kind of the second half of a Playstation controller.

1010
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,680
You've got your own analog stick and two shoulder buttons, and then on the back of the gun there's

1011
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,280
another analog stick right by the trigger.

1012
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:55,560
So in a sense, this would be the perfect solution for, you know, gun games or first person shooters.

1013
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,880
That way you can control your looking camera with, you know, the right analog stick, control

1014
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,400
your movement with the left analog stick, and then you can free aim with the gun.

1015
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,240
I mean, it's fucking awesome, except they will never use it like that and it will suck,

1016
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,240
so dammit.

1017
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,240
Frustration.

1018
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:18,560
Camara in chat says, it's upgraded Duck Hunt.

1019
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,560
Pretty much.

1020
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,560
Pretty much.

1021
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,560
I guess so.

1022
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,560
Sure.

1023
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
Sure, you got it.

1024
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
Upgraded Duck Hunt.

1025
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
Duck Hunt 2 coming out.

1026
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,560
Funny story.

1027
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,600
I'm not sure about Duck Hunt, but I heard that some old NES Zapper games, you could

1028
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:35,560
actually get perfect scores by aiming the light gun at a light and just keep shooting

1029
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,560
at the light.

1030
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,880
Or put a magnifying glass in front of a light gun.

1031
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,640
That's the other trick.

1032
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,640
Works like a charm.

1033
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,620
Anyhow, so there it is.

1034
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,360
GunCon Time Crisis 3 coming to the Playstation 3 very soon.

1035
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Yay.

1036
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,360
Awesome.

1037
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,520
And another thing that was announced for Playstation 3.

1038
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,880
Wake me up when they have point blank.

1039
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
That's all I have to say.

1040
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,880
Sorry.

1041
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
That would be awesome.

1042
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,500
And for the 360, Soul Calibur IV.

1043
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,760
Because we knew that Soul Calibur Legends couldn't be possibly the only game coming

1044
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,760
out.

1045
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:11,400
Soul Calibur IV will be coming out, they claim, that's going to be 60 frames per second.

1046
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,280
I read somewhere 90 frames per second, which would be stupid.

1047
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,680
But not that you would be able to see that.

1048
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,080
And then also that it's going to possibly be 1080p.

1049
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:30,220
The other thing, apparently everybody's been talking about certain characters getting boob

1050
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,720
upgrades in the game.

1051
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,880
It's just a fucking game, folks.

1052
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,000
But the teaser video that they had for it didn't really reveal too much because it was

1053
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,960
just still shots.

1054
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,000
Well, I'm just glad, you know, I know most games we joke about are obvious that they're

1055
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,080
coming like Silent Hill 5, Final Fantasy XIV someday, you know, and all these other series.

1056
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,680
I wasn't 100% for sure that there was going to be another Soul Calibur game, because I

1057
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,040
could have sworn they said with this last one, that's it, kids.

1058
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,840
And then the fact that, you know, the arcade release came later.

1059
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,400
There was a comment on Sony's website saying that Soul Calibur III was exclusive for PS2

1060
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,080
and any future Soul Calibur games.

1061
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:17,400
I was wondering, what happened with the decision with Soul Calibur IV being multi-console now?

1062
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,500
Well, you see what happened is that Microsoft actually sold consoles, so that's why the

1063
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,760
decision was made to go multi-platform, I guess.

1064
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,480
It could be the 4 million console leave that they have.

1065
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,920
Or there's this whole rumor thing, I mean, because Sony or the fanboys are writing the

1066
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,460
hate mail right now, but also look at this, is that Namco, and you know, you'll see this

1067
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:39,200
throughout some other stories you may hear tonight or may not, is that Namco and Microsoft

1068
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,200
are starting to be in bed together, you might notice.

1069
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,640
I mean, seriously, if you look at some of the decisions they've made recently and some

1070
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:49,600
of the things, I mean, not that they've abandoned PlayStation 3, but look at like, you know,

1071
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:55,680
Ace Combat and some of these other things, you know, Namco's kind of, you know, getting

1072
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,680
in bed with my, they're going out to dinner, they're giving each other, you know, sensual

1073
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,480
massages, they're, you know, they're getting to know each other a little bit here, getting

1074
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
comfy.

1075
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,480
Fucking popping out this goddamn Pac-Man sequel, babies.

1076
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,480
There you go.

1077
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,520
The true sequel.

1078
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,520
True sequel.

1079
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,680
Yeah, then the next fucking true sequel game.

1080
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,080
I love Soul Calibur, it's one of my favorite fighting game projects.

1081
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,040
I love Rod Calibur.

1082
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,280
With the Dreamcast thing?

1083
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,360
With the Dreamcast fishing rod, Rod Calibur.

1084
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,480
You just told that story like last time we had a show.

1085
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,400
I know, but every time I think of Soul Calibur, I think of Rod Calibur and how great it is.

1086
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
Fair enough.

1087
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,720
We need a new fishing controller for more Rod Calibur fun.

1088
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,120
I think about Ivy and how great she is.

1089
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:41,820
I think about trying to play Soul Calibur on the DDR pad on Dreamcast, and the only

1090
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,720
analog button was like the Konami logo.

1091
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,400
You're tapping your fingers like you want to say something, Loki.

1092
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,240
I'm not tapping my fingers because I want to say anything.

1093
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,120
He has a nervous twitch.

1094
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,120
It's because I'm only through Pepsi.

1095
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,560
You want to go get some Malibu?

1096
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,560
No, no, I'm good.

1097
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,360
Oh, actually, I was reminded that I cracked open alcohol in the studio without giving

1098
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,360
the OLR alcohol disclaimer, because we may have some young'uns who listen, and so just

1099
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,840
so you know, whenever we drink on the program, we do it responsibly.

1100
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,960
I live here, so I can drink because I'm not going to drive.

1101
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,560
That's why Jamie and Matt can't drink tonight, because they didn't make other arrangements,

1102
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,440
because they didn't know I was going to crack open the liquor.

1103
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,360
Matt, you have nasty alcohol here.

1104
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,760
And don't drink by yourself.

1105
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,920
And don't drink lots of water.

1106
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,760
Yes, and please don't drink lots of water and not pee.

1107
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,920
And don't sit on the ground drinking nothing but vodka and orange juice.

1108
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
All right, there.

1109
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,280
There's your disclaimer.

1110
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,280
Back to news.

1111
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,280
Hey, I have...

1112
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,280
Anything else on Soul Calibur?

1113
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,280
Sorry.

1114
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,280
Oh, yes.

1115
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,280
Explicit.

1116
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,000
Wait, wait, the raw Calibur?

1117
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That's...

1118
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I mean, the DDR pad.

1119
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Soul Calibur.

1120
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That's almost as best...

1121
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It doesn't work.

1122
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,280
That's almost as bizarre as someone trying to perform Shoryuken on a Street Fighter with

1123
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,280
the DDR pad.

1124
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280
Seen it happen.

1125
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
Seen it done.

1126
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,280
Shoryuken!

1127
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:58,600
It actually is much easier to do the... to do that with the DDR pad.

1128
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,200
I'm going to try some of those Xbox Live Arcade games I didn't like.

1129
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,160
Like, I'm going to try Novadrome with the DDR pad and see if it's more fun.

1130
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,160
No.

1131
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,160
Maybe.

1132
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,680
Maybe if I drink a few more, it'll be fine.

1133
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,040
All right.

1134
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,040
No, what...

1135
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,520
I have an excellent idea for some of these crappy games out there, and it's an excellent

1136
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,520
idea for...

1137
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,520
A gun?

1138
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
No.

1139
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
Skeet shooting?

1140
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,200
For the ultimate endurance test.

1141
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,680
Let me put it that way.

1142
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,680
Okay.

1143
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,880
DJ Genise in chat says, all video games are shit.

1144
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,160
Play with a jump rope.

1145
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,880
You might be listening to the wrong show, buddy.

1146
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,320
I don't know what to tell you.

1147
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,760
Well, you know, Microsoft would say jump in, so...

1148
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,760
Hitstun says you can kind of...

1149
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,760
Can I read my story, please?

1150
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,760
Yeah, all right.

1151
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,760
Wait, one more check on it.

1152
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,600
Hitstun says you can kind of play Street Fighter on a 2DX controller.

1153
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,600
You just can't... you just can't go left.

1154
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,600
Oh, well...

1155
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,160
So just be player one?

1156
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:00,720
I guess so, and hope that player two never thinks to jump over you or else you're fucked.

1157
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,880
I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.

1158
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,680
Anyway, for those who are keeping up with the PS1 games that were to be coming out on

1159
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:16,120
the PSN, PlayStation Store, or whatever the hell they're calling it, we have Crash Bandicoot,

1160
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:22,840
Wipeout, Medieval, Jumping Flash, and Syphon Filter that will be available on, looks like

1161
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
next Friday.

1162
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,560
Actually, no, is it this Friday?

1163
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,800
No, take that back.

1164
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,760
Next Friday, sorry.

1165
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,280
It will be available for PS3 and PSP, but you can only buy them from the PS3 store.

1166
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,520
I'm guessing that's for the UK.

1167
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,520
For the UK, yes.

1168
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,520
I'm sorry.

1169
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,520
My apologies.

1170
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,560
Also going to be available is on 22nd June.

1171
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,920
There will be Calling All Cars and Super Stardust HD on June 29th.

1172
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,880
I heard Calling All Cars sucks.

1173
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Take that, Dave Jeff.

1174
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,960
Well, I don't like to say that anything sucks until I've actually either seen it in play

1175
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,960
or have played it myself.

1176
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,160
No, I think I'm going to pass judgment before I play it.

1177
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,720
I know, I actually do that a lot, actually.

1178
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,320
Sometimes I'm wrong.

1179
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,440
I wrote off Halo.

1180
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,320
I was like, I will never like that game.

1181
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,040
I haven't liked a first-person shooter since Quake.

1182
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,040
Halo's going to suck.

1183
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,520
And then I actually played it at, get this, my friend's wedding reception.

1184
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,920
They had a Halo-themed wedding reception, and they had TVs all land together and played

1185
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
Halo.

1186
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,360
They actually had a cake with Master Chief on it, and that was the first time I ever

1187
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,880
played Halo, and I had a blast.

1188
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,000
So you can't always judge by looking, but some of the time you can.

1189
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Some of the time you really can.

1190
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,960
I already know why I can't play Halo.

1191
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,960
Because of the motion sickness thing.

1192
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,960
Yep.

1193
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,960
Sorry to hear it.

1194
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,960
All right.

1195
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:47,200
Well, let's talk about some upcoming games that you may or may not be playing in the

1196
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,200
near future.

1197
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,640
We like to travel the world when we do these releases, so let's take a look at the Japanese

1198
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:57,200
release dates and listen to me horribly mispronounce some game name titles, shall we?

1199
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,120
Coming out on the 21st on the Xbox 360, Saints Row finally in Japan, Shadowrun also coming

1200
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:09,120
out in Japan, and some other games coming to the Asian region, such as Vampire Rain.

1201
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:14,600
Also I want to point out Def Jam Icon also comes out from EA on the Xbox 360, all on

1202
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,320
June 21st.

1203
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:23,200
Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 21st is Hajime no Ippo Revolution, which looks

1204
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,320
to be another type of anime-based video game.

1205
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,320
Oh no, it's a sports title.

1206
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,320
It's a boxing title.

1207
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,320
Yeah.

1208
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,320
That's actually what it is.

1209
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
First something.

1210
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,320
Kind of cool.

1211
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,320
I don't remember what it's called.

1212
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,080
It's an anime series that's over here too.

1213
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,080
Gotcha.

1214
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,000
So I'm sure somebody in chat knows, and you might be wondering why isn't it Punch Out?

1215
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,160
Because this is made by AQ Interactive, not a Nintendo in-house production.

1216
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, a port of Def Jam Icon over there, as well as Monster

1217
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,140
Kingdom coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on the 21st.

1218
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,200
If you prefer to keep it with the current systems on the PlayStation 2, there's still

1219
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,120
quite a few games coming out.

1220
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,640
The Art of Fighting Collection moves into the best hits, and that comes out in Japan

1221
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,200
on the 21st.

1222
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,760
Also coming out, this is my favorite game name of the week.

1223
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,000
It's Fun Super Combo.

1224
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,540
That's F-U-U-U-N Super Combo.

1225
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:25,000
This actually just looks like a Neo Geo compilation of some of the games there that SNK put out

1226
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
previously.

1227
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I bet they're pretty fun.

1228
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I bet they are fun.

1229
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,560
Dude, it will be fun unless Psycho Soldier is one of them.

1230
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,680
Lots and lots of SNK loving this week in Japan, by the way.

1231
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,880
There's a King of Fighters thing coming out too.

1232
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,560
Are any of them new?

1233
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:43,200
If you're on the DS, I've got news for you.

1234
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,480
This could be the game of the year right here.

1235
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:52,400
Hello Kitty no Gattuchi Collection, Koi no Doki Doki Trouble is coming out.

1236
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,680
And the box is beautifully pink with Hello Kitty wearing a bunny suit.

1237
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,680
I think she's confused.

1238
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,920
No, this is made by Rocket Company, not SNK.

1239
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,280
That's on the Nintendo DS.

1240
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,700
I'm checking to see real quick if there's anything on the PSP, looking at my list here.

1241
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,400
See if there's anything on the PSP coming to Japan.

1242
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,060
Well, the Katamari Damacy game that was on the PSP moves into best hits, so you can get

1243
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,640
that a little cheaper over in Japan, otherwise not a lot of new stuff.

1244
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,840
Loco Roco also moves into best hits.

1245
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,840
Check it out.

1246
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,160
What about the Capcom vs SNK card fighting game?

1247
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,160
What's that?

1248
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,280
What about the Capcom vs SNK fighting card game that came out a while ago?

1249
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,740
It came out here, but it got recalled because it was fucked up, but they're fixing it for

1250
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,440
Europe where I don't believe it's been released.

1251
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,680
But remember the cool thing about the DS is they're not region locked, so you can buy,

1252
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,640
if you really want this game, you can import Europe's version or something and it'll be

1253
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,720
English and not fucked up, so something to think about.

1254
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,080
Alright, let's get to some more release dates, shall we?

1255
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:03,040
Alright, this week there's actually a few things coming out in the US, starting off

1256
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,520
with some weird games.

1257
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,240
PlayStation 2, The Adventures of Darwin.

1258
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,960
This is a little interesting.

1259
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,140
You basically, it's almost like a portion of Spore.

1260
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:19,840
You start off with a civilization that's pretty retarded and caveman-like, and you teach them

1261
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,560
to be more civilized.

1262
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,640
Then the Hitman trilogy is coming out, including the first three games of the Hitman series,

1263
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,040
so that's pretty interesting.

1264
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:37,640
On Xbox 360, we have Dirt coming out, which is an awesome off-road racing game, so definitely

1265
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,640
check that out.

1266
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:46,960
PS3, PQ2, remember those old IQ games, this one should be pretty cool.

1267
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,920
Hot Brain is going to be coming out on the PSP, another brain-training sim.

1268
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,960
PuzzleScape, another puzzle game.

1269
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,580
Dungeon Maker, Hunting Ground, a very interesting role-playing game with a little bit of sim

1270
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,640
aspects in there, that's going to be coming out as well.

1271
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,840
On PlayStation 3, you got a big fat nothing.

1272
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,280
Rainbow Six Vegas was going to be coming out this week, but once again, it's been delayed

1273
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,520
yet another week.

1274
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,480
The Wii, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is going to be making its way out, so that's going

1275
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,120
to be pretty cool.

1276
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:27,040
And the DS, Time Ace, which is that Konami game that we played that's, I guess, sequel

1277
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,720
to Time Pilot, I was the only one that kind of pointed that out, but Zendoku is going

1278
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,480
to be coming out, yet another Sudoku game.

1279
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,120
SimCity DS, Rob, possibly a game that you might want to pick up?

1280
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,120
Maybe, maybe.

1281
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,360
I have so many games, I still have World of Warcraft to worry about on top of all the

1282
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,480
other new crap I've got, so, I don't know, too many games, too many games, it's not even

1283
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,480
Christmas yet.

1284
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,400
The Transformers game is coming out a little bit early for the DS, you have both the Autobots

1285
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,740
and Decepticons games going to be heading your way.

1286
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:59,680
So there is more than meets the eye to these games.

1287
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:06,800
And then finally, NPC, Dirt is also coming out, as well as the Hitman trilogy.

1288
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:13,760
They're actually putting out, yet again, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, and The Sims Pet Stories

1289
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,480
will be making its way out.

1290
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,480
Goody, goody.

1291
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,340
You know, I went to the new Fry's Electronics they built out in Roseville, which is all,

1292
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,340
you know, train things out there.

1293
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,340
Very trainalicious.

1294
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,000
It's cute, it's cute, it's a cute store.

1295
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,040
You know, the Sacramento fries is unlike any other fries because it doesn't have a theme,

1296
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,080
but all the other fries around the world have themes.

1297
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,320
But anyway, the point is, I was looking at computer games just randomly, because I was

1298
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,880
thinking about maybe buying a new computer game, I was actually, I don't know why, I

1299
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,320
was tempted for like half a second to get the Lord of the Rings MMO, even though I know,

1300
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,200
it's like, I'm like, oh, I kind of want to try it for no good reason.

1301
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,200
But I didn't get it.

1302
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,680
But I was looking at computer games, not even kidding, one entire shelf, almost like two

1303
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,240
actually, dedicated to The Sims and all their spinoff series.

1304
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,840
I mean, which is, I mean, it is one of the, what, the best selling game ever.

1305
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,480
How many shelves are dedicated to the Tycoon series?

1306
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,640
I don't even want to know.

1307
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,680
Well, how about some different release dates?

1308
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,000
How about it?

1309
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,280
For our friends in the UK, coming out on the 22nd, we have Calling All Cars, like I said

1310
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:23,840
earlier, we have Flat Out Ultimate Carnage, Hot Pixel, Hour of Victory, Kirby Mouse Attack,

1311
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:30,580
Mario Party 8, Metroid Prime Pinball, Monster Madness, Pac-Man Rally, Sega Presents Touch

1312
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:34,560
Darts, and Cosmic Family.

1313
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,400
Metroid Prime Pinball just now?

1314
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,920
You poor kids over in the UK.

1315
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,920
I mean, it's not that that game was like that great, but seriously, that game came out here,

1316
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,920
what, like six months ago?

1317
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,920
Fuck that shit.

1318
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,640
They get Flat Out before I do.

1319
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,880
I mean, I want Flat Out for the 360 so I can launch my driver through the window and into

1320
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,880
things.

1321
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,160
It's one game early and, you know, they're bastards.

1322
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,320
Hey, they have Tomb Raider early, whatever, okay.

1323
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,320
Yay.

1324
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,240
Are you excited about Tomb Raider?

1325
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:09,320
That's what I thought.

1326
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,600
Let's talk about gaming on the Mac, shall we?

1327
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:16,960
Because we don't always get to talk about this and Loki usually has a field day with

1328
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:22,960
this topic, but, you know, there was a pretty big keynote done, sorry, I've been drinking.

1329
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,320
There's been a keynote done by Steve Jobs, did this, the Worldwide Developers Conference

1330
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:33,520
did a keynote and he talked about at the keynote that there are going to be, excuse me, I was

1331
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,520
very professional, sorry.

1332
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,520
Yay.

1333
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,600
I don't get a sneeze, but there's going to be coughing all over the Macintosh computers.

1334
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,960
No, here's what's really going on.

1335
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,640
They announced at the conference that Apple is going to be teaming up with EA and Electronic

1336
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,240
Arts is actually going to be putting out some of their games onto the Macs.

1337
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:57,360
Command and Conquer 3, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter, and Madden and Tiger Woods 08.

1338
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,280
So there you go, gaming on the Mac.

1339
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,920
About fucking time.

1340
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,280
Well, I think they've had some games before this, but, you know, EA is definitely stepping

1341
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,680
it up a notch on the Macintosh, so that's pretty cool.

1342
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:15,840
Another thing that's being shown off as well is id's Tech 5 engine, it's going to be their

1343
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,420
fifth generation 3D engine.

1344
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:25,020
You might remember them from such games as Quake 4, Doom 3, and all those other fun things.

1345
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:32,960
Of course, they said that their new engine will also be able to run on Mac OS X.

1346
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,960
So that's good.

1347
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:39,000
So you're actually going to get some pretty decent games on the Mac, finally.

1348
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,880
And it's also, it says, not being built with Microsoft's DirectX 10, which makes sense

1349
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,280
because not everyone wants to have Vista either.

1350
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,400
So that's pretty cool.

1351
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,000
And I guess this engine will also be able to run natively on the 360 and Playstation

1352
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
3.

1353
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,120
So the tech demo that they showed looked pretty cool, kind of reminded me of Motorstorm a

1354
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,400
bit, but very detailed, so I'm looking forward to some new games.

1355
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,740
Could this be a new Unreal engine?

1356
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:12,040
You know how that's the engine that everybody is licensing for their games?

1357
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,880
Could this be like the next great engine that everybody wants to license?

1358
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,880
Possibly.

1359
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,160
I mean, Doom 3, the Doom 3 engine was, I mean, Quake 4 engine had a lot of things going for

1360
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,160
it.

1361
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:27,180
Well, actually Quake 4 I think ran on the Doom 3 engine, so yeah, it could be the next

1362
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,180
big engine.

1363
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:32,280
I mean, if it does things that Unreal can't, personally, I think Crysis is going to be

1364
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,780
fucking awesome.

1365
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:38,620
That engine is going to be nuts as far as the amount of detail that's in it, so they

1366
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,720
have a real high bar to meet.

1367
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,240
Alright, well I guess we shall see.

1368
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:47,720
But I'm assuming, Loki, this doesn't exactly make you want to run out and buy a Mac.

1369
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,720
Why?

1370
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,720
My PC can run games just fine.

1371
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,720
I had a feeling.

1372
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,720
Although it's a bit old.

1373
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,360
I need a new one.

1374
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,480
A new PC!

1375
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:58,120
PC, personal computer.

1376
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,880
I do need to get a Mac upgrade at some point.

1377
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,920
I want one of those pretty new Macs, the big screen laptop.

1378
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Anyway.

1379
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
Sorry.

1380
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:12,760
Well, it looks like Capcom is going to start releasing titles through Steam.

1381
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:19,080
They're going to be putting out PC versions of Lost Planet, Onimusha 3, Devil May Cry

1382
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:23,680
3, Special Edition, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.

1383
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,240
Can I add for matching service to that, just because I think it's funny?

1384
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,280
Sure.

1385
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:33,120
But I did not know that the Puzzle Fighter game was coming to the computers.

1386
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,960
Or did I just miss that in the initial announcement?

1387
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,960
I guess so.

1388
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,520
Well, it says here that Capcom PC releases are going to be made available through Steam,

1389
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
so.

1390
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Apparently.

1391
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
Well, there you go.

1392
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Well, that's pretty cool.

1393
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,480
And I might add that their fucking Street Fighter 2 HD game looks fucking awesome.

1394
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,560
And I think that they've set the bar pretty high for any new 2D fighting games coming

1395
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,560
out.

1396
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,120
I'm not going to see Guilty Gear in that much detail.

1397
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:03,780
It does look pretty hot, but it's going to do the same thing that Pac-Man CE did to Pac-Man

1398
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,840
on Xbox Live Arcade, is it's going to piss you off that you bought the first one.

1399
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,480
When this Street Fighter 2 HD version comes out, it's an arcade release, right?

1400
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,480
Uh, yeah.

1401
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:15,480
Yeah.

1402
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,800
It's going to make you mad that you ever bought the Championship Edition release that came

1403
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,480
out last year.

1404
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,480
So.

1405
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,080
I have every other version, why not?

1406
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,080
I guess so.

1407
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,080
There you have it.

1408
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:31,280
Well, if you are a computer gamer, then you certainly know the series Monkey Island.

1409
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,480
You remember this series of games, Monkey Island?

1410
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,480
It's about pirates.

1411
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,480
Hell yeah.

1412
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,480
Huh?

1413
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,480
Oh, hell yeah.

1414
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,480
Well, hell yeah.

1415
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,480
Well, guess what?

1416
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,640
Apparently, going around LucasArts is rumblings of a fifth Monkey Island game.

1417
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,160
The fifth Monkey Island game is coming.

1418
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,120
I know some of the guys who worked on the music compositions for the original PC classics,

1419
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,600
and they say that it's currently being planned amidst rumors.

1420
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,760
However, LucasArts has so many things on its belt right now, including a Wii title that

1421
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,040
is yet to be named.

1422
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:04,960
Don't expect any revitalizations of its classic graphic adventures until 2008 at the earliest.

1423
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,520
That's coming from RumorReporter.com.

1424
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,000
You know, this is a game that needs to be made into a movie.

1425
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Monkey Island series.

1426
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,120
It'd be awesome.

1427
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,920
You know, with Sam & Max doing as well as it's doing critically, I mean, there's no

1428
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,820
reason why they shouldn't bring this back, and it would be kind of interesting to see

1429
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:25,400
it on a console, although these games will always kind of be PC games to me.

1430
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,320
Yeah, they're pretty cool, though.

1431
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:33,360
So we talked about it a while back that, you know, Playboy was going to be coming to Second

1432
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,360
Life.

1433
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:40,600
Well, they finally opened their doors in a fun little bunny-shaped island, and what can

1434
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,760
you find possibly on Playboy Island, you may ask?

1435
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:52,500
Well, plenty of bunny paraphernalia from its site, Playboy.com and ShopTheBunny.com.

1436
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:53,500
Fake women?

1437
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,720
Yes, fake women.

1438
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:03,760
You'll be able to buy avatars or merchandise for your avatars, and also for, you know,

1439
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,840
like fake bunny shirts and fake bunny ears.

1440
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,880
Or you can buy real merchandise that, you know, can get shipped to your house.

1441
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,880
All right.

1442
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,880
Fair enough.

1443
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,880
All right.

1444
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,880
So slash Playboy instead of slash pizza.

1445
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:19,440
I know they're going to have, you know, characters running around dressed up like the classic

1446
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,840
bunnies, so that's kind of neat.

1447
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,440
And yeah, I guess they're going to be also doing other, like, events and stuff like that,

1448
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:28,440
so.

1449
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,440
Events?

1450
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,960
Pool party!

1451
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,120
Fake pool party.

1452
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:34,120
Fake barbecue.

1453
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:38,200
But I love, I was reading some of the comments on the story, and it was kind of funny because

1454
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,640
they were like, I'm just going to fake bomb this place.

1455
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,920
Well, actually, RawSteelUT read my mind in chat.

1456
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,920
Can you throw cocks at the Playboy models?

1457
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,040
I think you can.

1458
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,240
Why?

1459
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:57,480
Come on, the cock throwing story in Second Life was funny.

1460
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,280
So what if it was like four months old, it's still funny?

1461
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,320
Kind of.

1462
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,680
There you go.

1463
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,560
If I actually played Second Life, I would want to throw some cocks.

1464
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,560
I mean, come on.

1465
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,560
What am I going to do?

1466
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,600
Sit around and pretend I'm at the Playboy mansion?

1467
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,480
I would build the massive cock launcher.

1468
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,440
It would be a giant cannon.

1469
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,760
That's all it would do.

1470
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,980
Because it's funny.

1471
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,640
That's why you would do it.

1472
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,640
Exactly.

1473
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,640
That and kittens.

1474
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,640
It would shoot cocks and kittens.

1475
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,640
Cocks and kittens.

1476
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
Hooray.

1477
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,640
You know, I'm kind of sad.

1478
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,080
I don't know if we're allowed to say this or whatever, but what the hell?

1479
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,280
I'm going to say it anyway because I've been drinking.

1480
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:36,520
If you guys read about that Playboy event that happened at the Playboy mansion last

1481
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:43,040
week with the whole, they were what, they were picking the gaming league folks or whatever.

1482
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,480
We got invited to that and we couldn't go.

1483
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,320
None of us could go.

1484
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,320
Sucks.

1485
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,820
I wanted to go.

1486
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,820
We should have said Dark Side.

1487
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,240
Dude, it was fucking lame.

1488
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,240
Was it?

1489
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:55,240
But it was at the Playboy mansion.

1490
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,240
It was lame.

1491
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,240
But it was at the Playboy mansion.

1492
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:01,680
Dude, it's for the god damn, was it the professional gaming league?

1493
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:06,000
They're trying to make gaming, they're putting it on TV.

1494
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,920
I don't want to watch people play games.

1495
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,920
I fucking hate that.

1496
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,840
I want to play games or play games against other people.

1497
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,880
I don't want to have people watch me play games.

1498
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,200
Instead of watching basketball on TV, why not go play basketball?

1499
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,200
Exactly.

1500
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,880
That's why I don't watch sports on TV.

1501
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,080
Well, you're just weird.

1502
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,920
But there's a lot of people out there that do enjoy watching other people play games.

1503
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,440
Don't you have friends that will come over and sit on the couch and watch you play?

1504
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,440
No.

1505
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,440
They don't really want to play themselves?

1506
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,440
They just will watch you play?

1507
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,840
never comes over to watch me play, and Nellie hates watching me play games. She's like,

1508
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,000
I want to watch TV instead!

1509
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,480
Okay, Jamie, you do this to some extent, right? You've told stories on this show before when

1510
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,080
you and Dan were gaming together that you like would help him through Resident Evil,

1511
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,000
but you would just be kind of content watching him, right?

1512
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Yeah.

1513
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,880
So, would it be fair to say that some people are okay with just watching people play games?

1514
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,880
Yeah.

1515
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,880
I don't know.

1516
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,400
Well, great. They can go ahead and start up their professional gaming league. It'll be

1517
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,400
like the fucking XFL. It'll be around for a couple of years, and then it will fade into

1518
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:14,220
dust, like it should, because no one wants to watch this shit. I mean, seriously, gamers

1519
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,220
don't even watch...

1520
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,640
But we were actually playing together.

1521
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:25,080
Okay, remember that stupid show on G4 Arena, okay? Remember that? I mean, granted, it had

1522
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,580
an interesting idea, let's watch gamers play games, and it sucked. It sucked really, really

1523
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,880
bad. You know why? Because it's watching people play games.

1524
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:38,120
The problem with Arena was just the way the show was kind of formulated. I don't think

1525
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,440
it was the...

1526
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:45,320
I don't give a shit about Joe Nobody, who fucking is like the Halo champ or something

1527
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,920
like that, and ooh, ooh, he got a headshot in the game. No, I think I'm just going to

1528
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,640
go back and play my own game now, thank you very much. I'm not going to subscribe to your

1529
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:59,220
pay-per-view event sponsored by fucking, you know, I don't know, Rockstar or something

1530
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:04,700
like that, so I can watch you play some stupid game that I could be playing right now and

1531
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:09,800
win $50,000 and go, I'm the fucking awesome, let me make my own keyboard brand and sell

1532
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,320
it for Uber money.

1533
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:22,000
Are you done? No? No, I'm done. You're such a dick, I swear to God.

1534
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,300
Okay, RawsteelUT brings up an excellent point. How about StarCade? StarCade was awesome,

1535
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,280
and you watched other people play games, or Nick Arcade for that matter. Those games rocked.

1536
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:38,600
Okay, bring that shit back. I would love to see that. That's good, but fucking watching,

1537
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:44,160
you know, clan members or whatever fucking play multiplayer games and shit, that's kind

1538
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:49,840
of boring. But I'd be down for like an 80s-style show or something where it's just people facing

1539
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,680
off in the arcades like their forefathers did.

1540
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,320
So you will watch people play games under the right circumstances.

1541
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:59,520
I'll play arcade games. Liar. Liar.

1542
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Liar is not the right word. The word I'm thinking

1543
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,400
of starts with an H. Homosexual?

1544
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,520
Hypocrite. Oh, hypocrite.

1545
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,560
No, Rob, that's just you.

1546
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:19,000
All right. Anyway, that show's not on TV anymore, so fuck that, I don't care.

1547
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,640
All right, anyhow. And M60. Oh no, I guess GS68 said it first. Hentai? Was that the word

1548
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,680
you were thinking? Hentai?

1549
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,680
Dear Rob.

1550
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:37,080
Speaking of Hentai, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet every week.

1551
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,520
For YowieBoyFun.com.

1552
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,360
And I don't know what she's looking at, but she likes to, oh yes, explicit.

1553
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,240
Are you going to YowieCon?

1554
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,240
Maybe.

1555
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,240
Of course.

1556
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:52,640
Everyone's trying to invite me to it.

1557
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,360
Why would you go to YowieCon? I don't even want to go to YowieCon. Why would you go to

1558
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,360
YowieCon?

1559
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:03,040
No, because everybody like, you know, all those groups and cosplayers, they all want

1560
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:06,280
me to, oh, come on, go.

1561
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:11,300
As I understand it, let's talk about Yowie for a minute. Why not? This is an appropriate

1562
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:17,440
lead into Dark Soccer's website of the week. Let's talk about a little bit of Yowie.

1563
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:24,200
For those of you guys that don't know what Yowie is, it's art that is, you explain it,

1564
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,480
Dark Soccer. I can't. It's man-on-man action.

1565
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:34,640
It's basically, imagine like the uber sweet, sappy, you know, typical heterosexual relationship

1566
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,160
and then change the gender of one of them to male.

1567
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:42,640
Okay. Good definition. But as I understand it, Yowie is not made for gay men. It's not

1568
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,160
gay porn. It's not gay anime.

1569
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,840
It's made for straight girls.

1570
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:52,040
Yowie is made for girls. So, I get asked all the time because Yowie is man-on-man action

1571
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:58,480
and you're going to YowieCon. And I say, okay, well, as a gay man, the last place I want

1572
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:07,840
to be on the planet is a hotel full of horny straight women. I mean, really. So stop asking

1573
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:14,080
me if I'm going to go to YowieCon because the answer is no.

1574
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:18,560
YowieCon maybe because I love my lesbians. I love my lesbians. I might go to YowieCon

1575
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,560
but I don't know about YowieCon.

1576
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,360
All right. Sorry. Sorry for the aside, Dark Soccer. I apologize for cutting into your

1577
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:28,360
precious website of the week time. We needed to have some Yowie chat. Can we do your website

1578
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,360
of the week now?

1579
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,360
Sure.

1580
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,360
All right. Here we go.

1581
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,360
Because I'm just playing with the stupid thing anyway.

1582
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,360
All right. Here we go.

1583
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:44,920
So, the website of the week is fallingsandgame.com which I have no idea what the purpose of this

1584
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,480
game is for anyway. But it's really stupid. All I'm doing is just watching it do shit.

1585
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:58,720
Yeah, it's a game from the same people who do cat or was it cat with bow golf or something?

1586
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,600
I don't know but I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing other than drawing lines and trying

1587
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:06,840
to make this thing destroy my sand slides.

1588
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,920
It's that thing that's running around on the outside. You're supposed to hit it with sand.

1589
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,520
Is this like Yoshi's Touch and Go?

1590
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,680
I've been hitting it with sand and it's not doing anything.

1591
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,840
Are you sure this game is fun?

1592
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:23,720
Because it explodes. They have one that's also with slugs and you have to pour salt

1593
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:24,720
on them.

1594
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:31,440
I hate slugs. I'm actually slug phobic people. You now know what my deepest fear is, slugs

1595
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,440
and snails.

1596
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:37,640
I don't know. Because I keep pouring sand on it. I think it's the type of sand I'm using.

1597
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,760
Grow sand.

1598
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:46,200
I want the sea monkey the game. Or that I can flush them down the toilet.

1599
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:51,680
That's the only thing missing from Sims 2 Pets.

1600
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:52,680
Funerals?

1601
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,680
No, flushing animals down the toilet.

1602
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,360
Funerals? Fish funerals? Remember when I had fish?

1603
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,360
This is fantastic.

1604
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,000
I prefer to call them funerals.

1605
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,320
It's just like, what the hell is this crap?

1606
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,680
Alright, give that URL one more time.

1607
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:12,000
FallingSandGame.com. I'm like, oil? What the hell is the oil thing? Oh, I see what it is.

1608
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,920
Dude, this is like the biggest ball of sand freakin' ever.

1609
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:19,240
FallingSand.com. That gets dark, sacra, steel, and thermal.

1610
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,240
Dude, fire!

1611
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,240
Alright.

1612
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:24,400
Dude, I just set the ball of sand on fire. That's great.

1613
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,400
Look at it.

1614
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,760
Can I move on? Are you finished?

1615
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
No, this is great.

1616
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,800
What is up with you people tonight and not being able to finish in a reasonable amount

1617
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,800
of time?

1618
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,800
I am paying attention.

1619
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,040
I am playing with the sand game.

1620
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,360
Can I talk about BlizzCon while you're playing with the sand game?

1621
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:40,360
Sure.

1622
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,280
Because I'm a little upset about this.

1623
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:46,400
As you know, I've been gone for the past two weeks, and during that time, tickets for BlizzCon

1624
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,000
went on sale.

1625
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And I actually was going to go to BlizzCon this year, while I get home and find out that

1626
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:59,280
the tickets went on sale June 13th, and then promptly sold out on June 15th.

1627
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,520
So tickets for BlizzCon 2007 already sold out.

1628
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,480
If you haven't heard, it's August 3rd and 4th at the Anaheim Convention Center.

1629
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,720
And you know, if you go, you're supposed to get all this free stuff.

1630
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:13,000
I, however, will not be going, and I'm a little bit bitter about it.

1631
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I know...

1632
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Are you going to cry?

1633
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
A little bit.

1634
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Actually, no, I'm not going to cry.

1635
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I'm going to get angsty.

1636
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:31,120
And you know what happens on the show when people get angsty?

1637
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,680
FUs of the week time, Dark Soccer, start us off.

1638
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,480
I'm trying to get the information out of my purse, because I'm going to tell people exactly

1639
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,760
where the fuck I went.

1640
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,520
Fuck you to the idiot at Quiznos.

1641
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,820
I wanted my sandwich.

1642
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:54,360
I specifically wanted a Philly cheesesteak sandwich on whole wheat bread with no mayonnaise

1643
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,280
and no sauce on it.

1644
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,640
Just meat and cheese and onions on wheat.

1645
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,640
And I didn't want it burned either.

1646
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,640
I want it toasted.

1647
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:08,660
So the guy's like, I'm like, okay, I want to go.

1648
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,320
Were you being served by Ozzy Osbourne?

1649
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:13,600
No, I was being served by a moron.

1650
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,520
And so I was like, okay, dude, I want a Philly cheesesteak.

1651
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
No mayonnaise.

1652
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,120
So he starts putting mayonnaise and I'm like, dude, I said no mayonnaise.

1653
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

1654
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,440
And then he puts it in and I get it.

1655
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,440
There's like, okay, prime ribs.

1656
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,440
No, I said Philly cheesesteak.

1657
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,440
Oh, okay.

1658
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,440
I'll go add cheese.

1659
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,440
What?

1660
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:36,360
And then he rings it up as a Philly, I was like, dude, okay, first of all, you bring

1661
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,960
me up as a prime rib.

1662
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:38,960
It's a different price.

1663
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,960
He's like, oh, well, this is cheaper, so I'll just charge you for that.

1664
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,960
Whatever.

1665
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,960
So finally, I just ended up saying, where's your manager?

1666
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:48,160
Oh, the manager's only here in the morning.

1667
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,160
Okay.

1668
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:55,840
So it's quiz nose number one, one, two, nine on, what is that road that's off of Zinfandel?

1669
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,920
I don't know.

1670
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,920
Not white rock.

1671
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,920
Just call it off of Zinfandel.

1672
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,240
Zinfandel and 50.

1673
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,960
It's off of Zinfandel near 50.

1674
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,960
Yeah.

1675
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:06,720
By the, across the street from Target and Cheezer's Pizza.

1676
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,720
Olson, it's Olson drive.

1677
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,720
Olson.

1678
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,720
I used to work on that road.

1679
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,720
Okay.

1680
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:15,520
It's Olson in Rancho, Cambodia.

1681
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,200
And the guy's name was, I can't pronounce it, but it's A-K-O-B.

1682
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,680
A-K-O-B.

1683
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,720
Don't never let this guy make you a sandwich because he'll burn it.

1684
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,560
You saw my sandwich, Rob.

1685
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,560
It was pretty burnt.

1686
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:35,140
It was, it was, I just came back from Philadelphia and you can't get cheesesteaks anywhere else

1687
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,140
like you can there.

1688
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,920
There's a reason they are Philly cheesesteaks.

1689
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,920
I know.

1690
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:39,920
Everything else is suck.

1691
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,960
I have never had such idiotic service anywhere.

1692
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,720
And I'm like, I can understand, you know, missing it once, but the dude wasn't even

1693
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,720
freaking listening to me.

1694
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:51,080
Anytime I said something, I was like, I want a small drink.

1695
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,560
He gives me a fucking large cup.

1696
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,120
I'm like, dude, small.

1697
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,680
Jamie, maybe he was high.

1698
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,560
No, he was, he didn't, I can tell him somebody's high.

1699
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,320
He was not red-eyed.

1700
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,920
He was not stealing the cheese out of the, the thing.

1701
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:10,640
He sounded, he just was speaking in a whisper and not listening.

1702
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:15,480
He was looking off in this face like, dude, I don't care how much you hate your job.

1703
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,840
You can at least do it right.

1704
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,840
You know?

1705
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,840
So whatever.

1706
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:19,840
All right.

1707
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,840
Thank you.

1708
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:26,880
A dark soccer for your very specific and directed eggs tonight, Loki, your F use of the week

1709
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:35,760
goes to Christopher's desk for being rotted that is really foul.

1710
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:42,280
Like I had to put a cup over the giant pile of rot.

1711
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,920
It's literally, there's like stuff growing.

1712
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,600
I'm creating a wall with cans.

1713
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,600
I don't have enough yet.

1714
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,840
So I have to drink a couple more cans.

1715
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,120
Is that it?

1716
01:21:54,120 --> 01:22:00,640
My F you of the week goes to myself and the target that's across the street from said

1717
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:06,600
quiz knows because I was there and I was buying some diet soda.

1718
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,080
In fact, the IBC root beer I'm consuming right now that's mixed with Malibu.

1719
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,560
I was buying that and as I was pulling it off the shelf, I, it got caught on the cream

1720
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,920
soda next to it.

1721
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,080
And so all the IBC cream soda went all over the floor and there was breaking glass everywhere.

1722
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:23,520
It was, it made a beautiful noise, but F you to myself for being such a klutz.

1723
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,480
I told you fucking cream soda sucks.

1724
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,680
See now you know.

1725
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,680
All right.

1726
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:35,800
Uh, explicit and the F use tonight, um, uh, F used to having a flat tire during the road

1727
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:40,280
while I was trying to go to my cousin's graduation and brought a lot of stuff.

1728
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:46,840
Luckily I came in, came into the party, um, rather than not being able to make it after

1729
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:52,840
he goes to pretty much everybody keeps overrated the over 9,000 joke.

1730
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,240
What is the over 9,000 joke?

1731
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,240
Dare I ask?

1732
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,240
Okay.

1733
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,600
If you go to YouTube or just type in over 9,000 up at Google.com.

1734
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,960
Is it a Dragon Ball Z thing?

1735
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:03,960
Yeah.

1736
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,960
Okay.

1737
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:05,960
I have seen it.

1738
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,960
Power level is over 9,000!

1739
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,960
DMN.

1740
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:13,920
DMN linked me to something or sent us a song or something and I wanted to poke him in the

1741
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,920
eye with a fork.

1742
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:15,920
Yes.

1743
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,920
I know what you're talking about now.

1744
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:17,920
Yeah, exactly.

1745
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,760
I hear that almost every freaking day.

1746
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:25,200
Um, let's see, an F goes to my co-workers for trying to make me break, um, New Year's

1747
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,200
resolution.

1748
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,760
I'm not sure if you guys will know what the New Year's resolution might, gave up for the

1749
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,760
whole year.

1750
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:32,760
Well, dare I ask what it is?

1751
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,760
Not erections again, is it?

1752
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,760
No, no, no.

1753
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,760
You gave up sex or masturbating?

1754
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,760
Masturbation.

1755
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,360
You gave up masturbating for a whole year?

1756
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,360
Yeah.

1757
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:41,360
Oh my God.

1758
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,240
Are you having sex with women at least?

1759
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,840
Uh, sadly no.

1760
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,160
Oh my God.

1761
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,160
You're gonna die.

1762
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,120
You should just get a hooker.

1763
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,120
For real.

1764
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:57,680
Wow, you're, you're a brave man, that's all I have to say.

1765
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:04,160
Let's see, another F goes to everybody, I'm still talking about the 300 Sparta joke.

1766
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,960
Combined with a Chuck Norris.

1767
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,040
Hey, I got a shirt that says, this is Zelda.

1768
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,040
That was actually funny.

1769
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,040
Yeah, I got that.

1770
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,040
That was, that was a good times.

1771
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,080
F you to some of the kids in shotgun for asking me for money.

1772
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,760
Okay, if you, I don't know, I'm not sure how many, how many, how much money these kids

1773
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,040
spend on a con.

1774
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:31,800
Especially with their like $110 swords and their $50 Naruto jacket, et cetera, et cetera,

1775
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,800
et cetera.

1776
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,880
Oh God, we're gonna be starting on that.

1777
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,320
Let's see, and well, that's all for now.

1778
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:43,120
I always like how he always leaves it with, that's all for now.

1779
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,360
And then he'll be back like in a year.

1780
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,040
Here's some F use I've collected over the past year that I'd like to share with you

1781
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,040
here.

1782
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,320
Actually, actually I found something.

1783
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,300
I found something just for you.

1784
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,300
This is just for you.

1785
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,300
Jonas

1786
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:25,720
Isn't that one of the most God awful things you've ever heard that was made by DMN.

1787
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:30,800
Oh gee, didn't see that coming.

1788
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,320
I'll send you the MP3 later, Jonas.

1789
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,440
Anyhow, anyways, can we get back to games please?

1790
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:43,200
So something kind of cool came down to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace and once I saw

1791
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:48,720
it, I thought, well, I don't know, I had to watch it, but I didn't, so.

1792
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:53,040
Basically the Xbox Live Marketplace, among other things, got a whole bunch of anime.

1793
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:58,880
So that's pretty awesome, including Guyver, Trinity Blood, Gunslinger Girl, Speedgrapher,

1794
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:07,200
Basilik, Sayuki, Kitty Grade, Genku, I can't even, The Count of Monte Cristo, whatever.

1795
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,240
Desert Punk, Last Exile, Rumbling Hearts, Galaxy Railways, Gilgamesh, and Lupin the

1796
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,120
Third Part 2.

1797
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:20,520
But it also got Akira, and Akira in HD, which is fucking awesome.

1798
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,320
So definitely worth checking out, especially if you're an anime fan, because that's one

1799
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:26,700
of the best anime movies I think of all time.

1800
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:32,160
And I believe Lady Death was also on there in HD, so that's something else.

1801
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,960
Then beyond all that, National Geographic shit.

1802
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,240
So yeah, National Geographic Adventure, and yeah.

1803
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,220
So, watch some Akira in HD.

1804
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,160
Can I tell you a secret?

1805
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:48,500
Most people assume that because I do this show, I watch a ton of anime, which is so

1806
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,500
not true.

1807
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,960
I've never seen Akira.

1808
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:51,960
Why?

1809
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,160
I just haven't.

1810
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,080
The manga's better, don't watch the anime.

1811
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,240
No, no, no, no.

1812
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,840
The anime is fucking awesome, and you know what?

1813
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,840
I watched it.

1814
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,840
Well, I started a fight.

1815
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,680
I remember going to this, you know, it was a place called Steamers or whatever, it was

1816
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:10,520
a coffee shop slash video rental place.

1817
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,360
It was like one of the mom and pop shops or something around in Elorado Hills.

1818
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:20,240
So I went one day, bored, and so I was like, I'm going to go rent something.

1819
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:25,280
So I went to the cartoon section, I don't know why, and I saw Akira, you know, rated

1820
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:30,400
R, so I picked it up, and of course a car at that time.

1821
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,320
But it's fucking awesome, dude.

1822
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,960
It has, you know, full frontal, has people's limbs getting blown off, motorcycle chases.

1823
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,560
Oh, sorry, I heard full frontal and I woke up.

1824
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,080
Space satellite lasers.

1825
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,080
It does have the bike, however, the cool thing about the manga is that the movie is like

1826
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,080
manga-lite.

1827
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:55,720
There's like, at least 30 chapters where Kaneda is not even anywhere, he just disappears.

1828
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:56,720
It's a fucking awesome movie.

1829
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,280
One of the main characters.

1830
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,120
It's got a character that looks like Louie Anderson.

1831
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,120
So you gotta...

1832
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,120
That is true.

1833
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:08,040
You've got to watch it, and he kind of sounds like you, too.

1834
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,960
I hate Louie Anderson, you're not selling me this.

1835
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,960
And when he gets killed.

1836
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,960
And 50-year-old children.

1837
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:16,240
Can we please move on?

1838
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,240
He's like old Louie Anderson.

1839
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,120
Can we finish part A tonight at some point?

1840
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,120
And the clowns!

1841
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:23,880
If old Louie Anderson, oh yeah, the clowns, if old Louie Anderson could like do, you know,

1842
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,400
psychokinetic shit.

1843
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,680
That's fucking awesome.

1844
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:31,640
Is this, has this show really lasted five years somehow?

1845
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,640
Not yet!

1846
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,640
We're not there yet.

1847
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:36,400
That's right, it could all end tonight, boys and girls.

1848
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,400
Crash!

1849
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,400
We're getting close.

1850
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,680
Okay, can we talk about something else, Rob?

1851
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,680
Sure.

1852
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:42,680
Read the manga.

1853
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,160
Shut the fuck up and read a story.

1854
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,160
Okay.

1855
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,160
Well guess what?

1856
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:53,720
You know that Castlevania film that was supposed to be done by Paul W.S. Anderson?

1857
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:56,200
Well he said, fuck y'all.

1858
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,200
Not really.

1859
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,400
He said, I'm working on other projects.

1860
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,800
Like he's remaking Death Race.

1861
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,800
And that is awesome.

1862
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,800
Yeah, it's more priority over Castlevania.

1863
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,800
I agree.

1864
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,800
Yes.

1865
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,960
However, the one that they are getting to replace him is Sylvain White, who brought

1866
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:20,920
us such classics as Stomp the Yard, and I'll always know what you did last summer.

1867
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,680
Such great American cinema classics.

1868
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:27,120
He is quoted saying, most of the vampire films that have been present are set in the future

1869
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:31,760
from Blade to Underworld, and I was attracted to the chance to make a dark, epic period

1870
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,640
movie that almost had an anime feel to it.

1871
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:37,720
Well there's Castlevania right the fuck there, so.

1872
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,320
Uh, Van Helsing?

1873
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,320
Anybody?

1874
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,720
Yeah, but that wasn't a good movie.

1875
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,720
It just had Hugh Jackman being sexy, and that's it.

1876
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,040
But it had vampires in it, it was a period piece.

1877
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,440
But it was a bad movie.

1878
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,320
What about Bram Stoker's Dracula?

1879
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,320
That was sexy!

1880
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,320
Oh my god.

1881
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,320
Anybody?

1882
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,320
How about Interview with the Vampire?

1883
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:59,120
That movie was so hot, I would make love to it if I could.

1884
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,280
That was sort of multiple...

1885
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,640
It was part period, part present, part...

1886
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,640
You don't understand that.

1887
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,640
Part just, like, gay.

1888
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,640
It's like...

1889
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:07,640
It's a gay movie.

1890
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,640
It really is.

1891
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,640
I just expected making out all over the place.

1892
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,640
For real.

1893
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,640
That was a good movie.

1894
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,680
He probably just doesn't watch a lot of those classic films, you know, because he's in a

1895
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:19,360
whole other, you know, decade now, so.

1896
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,920
Who watches any of that stuff?

1897
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:31,800
Well, I have to say that maybe, maybe he's, he might have some, I mean, if he gets the

1898
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,400
imagery off, then that'll be good, but you know what's also though interesting that he's

1899
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,920
going to be directing is Ronin, Frank Miller.

1900
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:46,520
As long as it's not Paul W.S. Anderson or Riebel, you know, we need someone else to

1901
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,560
make fun of for making crappy movies.

1902
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,840
Everyone has to start off somewhere, right?

1903
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,600
Well he did do I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer.

1904
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,040
That's a springboard, I'll say.

1905
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:02,160
I'm going to try to have some faith because you know me and my Castlevania, oh my god.

1906
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,840
I will withhold judgment until the film is done, that's only fair, right?

1907
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,840
Right, Halo.

1908
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,840
Everybody deserves a chance.

1909
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:08,840
Right, Halo.

1910
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:09,840
What?

1911
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,840
Halo.

1912
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:11,840
Halo.

1913
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,600
You said yourself that you passed judgment on Halo.

1914
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:14,600
I just.

1915
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,600
Have you learned your lesson, Rob?

1916
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,600
I so got pwned just now.

1917
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,600
Have you learned your lesson?

1918
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:20,360
No, I'll never learn my lesson.

1919
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,720
Haven't you learned that after five years?

1920
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:29,680
I know, but I'm not going to tell, I'll always know where Jigglypuff is hiding last summer.

1921
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:33,640
And now I think it's about time to say goodbye to part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1922
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,940
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back after a little break with more of

1923
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,600
Orange Lounge Radio.

1924
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,800
For those of you guys listening live here on Sunday night, you get part B just in a

1925
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:45,240
few minutes, but for those of you guys listening to us on our audio archive or podcast feed,

1926
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,600
you just have to wait a couple days.

1927
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,400
We'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1928
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:54,920
We prefer to call it actually Orange Lounge Radio Championship Edition because it is technically

1929
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:58,600
a brand new sequel to the original Orange Lounge Radio episode.

1930
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,160
Yeah, Loki, shut up.

1931
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:04,880
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1932
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,880
a week.

1933
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:32,440
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
