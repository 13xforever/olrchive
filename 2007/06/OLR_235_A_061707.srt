00:00:13,903 --> 00:00:25,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 17th, 2007, Soul Calibur preps its fourth game for the PlayStation 3 and 360, Sony builds itself a blog, and has Project Hammer gotten some nails in its coffin?

2
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:35,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:36,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to be back.

4
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:44,661
[SPEAKER_04]: We were off last week and we missed you guys, but we're back this week to talk about the latest in video games, the gaming world, gaming culture, and all that good stuff.

5
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:55,608
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and with me here, as always, right by my side, hanging on to my arm, clutching it, sucking the very life out of it, is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:57,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Ripping it off and beating you with it, maybe.

7
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that like an attack you can do in Dead Rising, actually?

8
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,551
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened in Shaun of the Dead, except they ripped off his legs and then went after zombies with him.

9
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:07,293
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best scene in the movie.

10
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:08,213
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG, spoilers.

11
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:10,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Who hasn't seen Shaun of the Dead yet?

12
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:12,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Go see Hot Fuzz, everybody, by the way.

13
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:14,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Here goes the chat room going, me, me, me.

14
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:16,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

15
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:18,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

16
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:19,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen Shaun of the Dead, Loki?

17
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:21,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, twice.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good times.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:33,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I have to admit, when DarkSakura, like, you know, because she does movie nights once in a while at her place, and I admit when she first, you know, was like, let's watch Shaun of the Dead, I was like, oh, God, all right, fine, we'll watch a movie.

20
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:33,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only two hours.

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually really good.

22
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:41,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you were there a couple years ago, but we did Shaun of the Dead, and then we watched the new Dawn of the Dead.

23
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:42,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think it was in the reverse.

24
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,400
[SPEAKER_03]: We watched the new Dawn of the Dead, and then Shaun of the Dead, and

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't there because I never saw the new Dawn of the Dead.

26
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the new Dawn of the Dead sucked.

27
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:50,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaun of the Dead was awesome, though.

28
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:51,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And Hot Fuzz is better.

29
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:53,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't seen Hot Fuzz.

30
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:53,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot Fuzz is great.

31
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:54,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it twice now.

32
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, give me one of yours.

33
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to see it with Ranma.

34
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:01,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously can't remember the last... That's right.

35
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:03,890
[SPEAKER_04]: When we left, you guys went to the movie.

36
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I go see Transformers early.

37
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:06,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you?

38
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:07,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Before it comes out.

39
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:07,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky you.

40
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:08,733
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you spend that?

41
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Through work and stuff?

42
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:10,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, through work.

43
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:10,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, very nice.

44
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:11,615
[SPEAKER_04]: A few days.

45
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:12,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

46
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:14,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we a movie podcast?

47
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, they're making a game based on it, and it's going to be fucking awesome.

48
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:21,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And they should make a game out of Shaun of the Dead, shouldn't they?

49
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:22,533
[SPEAKER_04]: They should.

50
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:23,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

51
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Fuzz would be funny, too.

52
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:26,875
[SPEAKER_02]: A romantic comedy with zombies in the game.

53
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:34,018
[SPEAKER_04]: One of these days, I seriously think the last movie I saw in the theater was Notes on a Scandal, which they should not make into a video game.

54
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:35,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that would be a very interesting video game.

55
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,561
[SPEAKER_04]: You can control Judi Dench as she creates...

56
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:41,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Lesbian Scandal.

57
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:42,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be wonderful.

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

59
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And you take notes on it.

60
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,717
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

61
00:02:48,757 --> 00:02:48,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

62
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I've been spending the whole week looking for my copy of Elite Beat Agents because Dan wants to play it.

63
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:29,431
[SPEAKER_02]: And playing some World of Warcraft, like hardly any, because I still want Burning Crusade so I can play a hot little elf.

64
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:32,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

65
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:34,375
[SPEAKER_04]: You still haven't gotten Burning Crusade?

66
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:36,857
[SPEAKER_02]: What money do I have, Rob?

67
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:37,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

68
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:40,480
[SPEAKER_04]: You certainly don't get paid for this, so I don't know.

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't have much money, so no.

70
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:44,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry to hear it.

71
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless someone in the chatroom wants to buy it for me.

72
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:47,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Sell a pinball machine.

73
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:48,611
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not mine.

74
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:49,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

75
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:50,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the spouse's.

76
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

77
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:53,396
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

78
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:54,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

79
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,882
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

80
00:04:16,195 --> 00:04:28,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to verify, because I haven't been reading up too much on Fable 2, you will still able to be a bisexual evil warlord, correct?

81
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:30,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yes, and you can get pregnant.

82
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,332
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm a male, that might be difficult.

83
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:34,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that might be difficult.

84
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:35,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

85
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:35,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but...

86
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:39,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a real fable right there.

87
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,125
[SPEAKER_03]: There once was a pregnant man.

88
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:43,889
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely do not, like,

89
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:47,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be uber evil.

90
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,980
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's actually pretty cool.

91
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:22,404
[SPEAKER_03]: The other game I played was Monster Madness and now this game I was kind of looking forward to check out because it reminded me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors and who doesn't like Zombies Ate My Neighbors?

92
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,765
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is no Zombies Ate My Neighbors and it's awful.

93
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: The controls in it, awful and it's way too damn hard so I don't recommend it at all.

94
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:37,349
[SPEAKER_03]: The other games I played, Mad Trax, I actually tried that out a little bit and that was pretty fun.

95
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I played through a few levels of that, although there really isn't too much to the game.

96
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You can probably beat it pretty quick.

97
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:46,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're kind of trying to sell those additional add-ons for it.

98
00:05:47,102 --> 00:05:48,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, not my thing.

99
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:51,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't play Pac-Man Championship Edition.

100
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:54,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at it, downloaded the demo, still haven't played it yet.

101
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,105
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's Pac-Man.

102
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, it's a sequel to Pac-Man.

103
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:00,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more to say on this, but I'll wait my turn.

104
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dan downloaded that.

105
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, okay, what the hell?

106
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:06,728
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, I came home, all I was doing was freaking screaming at the ghosts.

107
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:10,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't he do that all the time?

108
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,727
[SPEAKER_02]: He was really screaming at me.

109
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,507
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, like, calling them bastards.

110
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, you sound like me talking to my computer.

111
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:22,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I downloaded the Project Sylphid demo today, but I forgot to play that.

112
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:26,350
[SPEAKER_03]: But I finished Super Paper Mario.

113
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:27,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats.

114
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:32,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the end is, like, you saw it coming throughout the entire game, and...

115
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:37,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, once you finish it, you're rewarded with... Don't you fucking spoil it!

116
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:38,834
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to spoil it.

117
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:45,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, once you finish the game, you're rewarded with, hey, you get to go back to this one level and fight 100 people, and they'll take another couple hours.

118
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:46,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

119
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's awful.

120
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:49,418
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the whole game is.

121
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:52,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It's full of this, like, fight 100 people, do that for two hours.

122
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,341
[SPEAKER_04]: So, are you saying at the end of the game, you get told, we're sorry, Mario, but our princess is in another castle?

123
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,562
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's more like...

124
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:00,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sorry, Mario, but your game sucks.

125
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like, thank you for playing through the game.

126
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,727
[SPEAKER_03]: No replay value whatsoever.

127
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Sell it back to GameStop.

128
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:06,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

129
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:09,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's pretty much what I'm going to have to do.

130
00:07:10,091 --> 00:07:11,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I did download Zelda 2.

131
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:14,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but I've actually been playing this game.

132
00:07:14,374 --> 00:07:15,775
[SPEAKER_02]: You can lend it to me before you sell it back.

133
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:18,458
[SPEAKER_04]: You can borrow my copy.

134
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:19,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not playing it.

135
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:20,539
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really want to play it, I'll loan you mine.

136
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great game.

137
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, after you...

138
00:07:24,284 --> 00:07:25,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Played through all of it.

139
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:29,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of... There's a bunch of side quests you can do that have no reward whatsoever.

140
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:30,808
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Zelda 2?

141
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:31,848
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Zelda 2.

142
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:32,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was talking about Super Mario.

143
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,209
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Zelda 2 is awesome.

144
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Zelda 2 is fucking rad.

145
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why people diss it.

146
00:07:37,091 --> 00:07:38,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of the worst in the series.

147
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:38,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

148
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird.

149
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:43,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Go fucking play Wand of Gamelon if you want to see the worst ones in the series, okay?

150
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,915
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't feel like Zelda at all.

151
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just very strange.

152
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:49,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember playing through it and it being very hard.

153
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It still is kind of hard, but...

154
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I can understand it more.

155
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:57,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did the name of everything really strange names is beyond me?

156
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:58,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Error.

157
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remember that.

158
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:01,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I went in and I'm like, oh, there's that.

159
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:09,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was actually supposed to have been something else, and it programmed in wrong, if I remember right.

160
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:09,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

161
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:10,648
[SPEAKER_02]: With the translation.

162
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:11,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

163
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:12,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that on a shirt.

164
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:14,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I am Error.

165
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:16,129
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be a shirt somewhere.

166
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:16,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there is.

167
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,510
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just have one made, you know?

168
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe his name is just Error.

169
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

170
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to name my firstborn Error.

171
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, fucking look at that.

172
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:29,659
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a horrible thing for parents to do, to name their baby Error.

173
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:30,941
[SPEAKER_06]: With the middle name Oops.

174
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Error, Oops, Summers.

175
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:36,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

176
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:49,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, finally, the last game I've been playing, and this is weird because I've actually played this game more than I've played Guitar Hero, but it uses the Guitar Hero controller for the 360, and it's a game for the PC called Fret Nice.

177
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:56,860
[SPEAKER_03]: The best way to describe it is it's like playing Loco Roco with a guitar, and it actually works pretty well.

178
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,850
[SPEAKER_03]: and they've got some really interesting level designs and stuff.

179
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,650
[SPEAKER_03]: The only bad thing about it is it's only three levels long, but it's a lot of fun.

180
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So I recommend downloading that.

181
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:16,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I may post a link to it in my blog on all games so that you can actually find it because it's on some foreign website or something.

182
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:21,415
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's cool and it's free, so I highly recommend doing that.

183
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I don't play the

184
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:45,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero, it's weird we did this thing on Friday last week that it was basically this sales team building thing and we had to perform songs on stage and they have video of it but anyways they had like one person had the air guitar so I had to do the air guitar part of it because I didn't want to sing

185
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:50,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero

186
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:36,216
[SPEAKER_03]: or because you were on the internet radio program about music video games therefore you can pass every catastrophic and DDR oh yeah back in the day maybe I could three quarters of those back in the day I wasn't so fat exactly because I played more DDR exactly then you get married and you don't have DDR time and it all goes downhill from there anything else about your gaming week you want to share um

187
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:40,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I played more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

188
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

189
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:48,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my last copy of Saints Row, and so we're going to be landing those five systems together very soon.

190
00:10:49,008 --> 00:10:49,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

191
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in time for the sequel, maybe?

192
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Saints Row 2, that's not coming out for a while, but...

193
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:56,482
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

194
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:21,759
[SPEAKER_04]: in New York City, and that was a great time.

195
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:30,025
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually went to Dave & Buster's in Times Square and just kind of messed around there for a little while and played this game called Jumpin' Jackpot, which is hilarious.

196
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:31,206
[SPEAKER_04]: They have one of these at Roseville Golf Line.

197
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:38,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's the virtual jump rope with the lights going around, and it plays this really super gay rave music while you're jumping.

198
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:42,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's hard, and it's crack.

199
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You keep putting money in over and over.

200
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:45,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And we played some DDR.

201
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:45,696
[SPEAKER_04]: They had, like, Superdome.

202
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:48,398
[SPEAKER_04]: We were playing a bunch of stuff, and it was a good time.

203
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:49,439
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you laughing at?

204
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:54,953
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

205
00:12:20,023 --> 00:12:20,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

206
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave and Busters.

207
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,236
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have enough tickets to buy an Xbox 360 game, but I'm just not interested in anything that they have there.

208
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so big thanks to all the listeners that showed up.

209
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:38,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Also went, Ranma took me to this video game shop, or I think he was the one that led the way, I mean all of us kind of went there, all of us that were still together at this time.

210
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:53,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to this video game shop near Aster Place, where the big cube is, and they had like tons of stuff, like I sent you the picture of the Hello Kitty Dreamcast, and all these important stuff, but they were selling old school NES games, and my friend has an old school Nintendo game.

211
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:53,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

212
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,051
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very interesting.

213
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:21,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it in the box?

214
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:23,393
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was just the card and the black sleeve.

215
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:25,494
[SPEAKER_02]: When I bought mine, I paid $10 and I got it in the box.

216
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:28,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But I got her an original cartridge of Guardian Legends, so that made me happy.

217
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:29,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely unopened.

218
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:31,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.

219
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:32,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my Guardian Legend.

220
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I opened it to play it, of course.

221
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:36,381
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

222
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I got her a copy of Guardian Legend.

223
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:42,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have just took it home with me, but I don't have an old school Nintendo here.

224
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:45,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm holding out hope they will put it on Virtual Console eventually.

225
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:45,747
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

226
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you know in this room who has five Nintendos?

227
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:49,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to give me one?

228
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:51,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, I could.

229
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:52,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet!

230
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk to Dan.

231
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:56,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Then maybe I'm going to send Amanda back to that store and get me more games.

232
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Just buy a Generation Next.

233
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:00,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, we'll talk about that later in the show.

234
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,576
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this other thing coming out I'll talk about later.

235
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:02,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, it's already out.

236
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, isn't it on the show roll?

237
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:04,278
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

238
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:05,920
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is something else.

239
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,802
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the thing we saw at E3 like a few years back.

240
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:08,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that thing!

241
00:14:09,363 --> 00:14:10,784
[SPEAKER_04]: The $20 console thing.

242
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:11,084
[SPEAKER_03]: $60, yeah.

243
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:11,084
$60?

244
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:11,805
[SPEAKER_03]: $60 bucks.

245
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:15,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were only charging people $20 or was that just at the show?

246
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,221
[SPEAKER_04]: That was at the show.

247
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:16,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see.

248
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:17,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Should have bought it at the show.

249
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:18,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, damn it.

250
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:19,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

251
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:23,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so yeah, obviously there was some 8-bit gaming goodness, Dave and Busters.

252
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:34,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally caved and I got a DS Lite, which by the way, I saw this story floating around blogs this week talking about how Nintendo World has these custom DS Lites that you can buy in all these different colors.

253
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:35,951
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted $280 for those.

254
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:41,394
[SPEAKER_04]: and the picture that's floating around doesn't show you all the colors that they have.

255
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:49,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they added some or what because I distinctly remember there was a green one because that's the one I wanted to get and you don't see that one in the pictures that made it around all the different game blogs.

256
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:52,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Check DJ Ranma's picture site which I'm sure he'll link in chat right now.

257
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's DJRanmaS.net and check out his New York City pictures.

258
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,844
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually took a picture of the case with all the colors and some of the newer ones that were in there.

259
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:02,305
[SPEAKER_04]: It was between that and the fuchsia hot pink one.

260
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:06,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what the fucking website is but there is a website out there that you can buy.

261
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:32,830
[SPEAKER_03]: custom colored anything consoles $280 they wanted for that well you can buy it cheaper than that they sell iPods there they sell PSPs you know DS lights everything and you can get them in custom colors so I'm not sure about DS lights but I know they sold the original DS on this site but people just forget they can do that or just paint it I don't know take it apart and paint the damn thing

262
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:47,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh, well they also do engraving there, and I almost bought my new DS Lite at the Nintendo World Store to get it engraved, because they'll engrave your DS for only like 20 bucks, and there's all these patterns you can choose from, and I thought that was pretty awesome, but their engraving machine was broken.

263
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:48,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't get to do it.

264
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,232
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sucks to that.

265
00:15:50,812 --> 00:15:52,733
[SPEAKER_04]: They're engraving machines that I am error.

266
00:15:52,914 --> 00:16:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, when I got to Pennsylvania, I was like, well, sales tax is lower here than it is in California.

267
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so bored in Pennsylvania, I have to be honest.

268
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,243
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense to those of you folks that live in the Allentown area where I was at for a few days, but...

269
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:08,624
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

270
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't want your opponent, who's going to go after you, to be able to line up the skulls.

271
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:40,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Because basically, to explain the game real fast, there's the story that all goes with it.

272
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:45,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You can cast spells, which are like special moves on the board, but to do that requires mana.

273
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the stones on the board are red, yellow, blue, and green.

274
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:53,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you also have gold coins, purple experience stars, and skulls.

275
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:54,736
[SPEAKER_04]: When you line up the coins, you get gold.

276
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:57,218
[SPEAKER_04]: When you line up the experience stars, you get experience, so you can level up.

277
00:16:57,598 --> 00:17:00,360
[SPEAKER_04]: When you line up the skulls, your opponent takes damage.

278
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest Puzzle League

279
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,754
[SPEAKER_04]: to really play, to give it a fair response.

280
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:32,317
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know it's, I played it once, and I know it's very similar, of course, to Pokemon Puzzle League, but with some new stuff.

281
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:34,298
[SPEAKER_02]: You totally reminded me of the other game I was playing.

282
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:34,758
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

283
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:35,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemans!

284
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:37,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Pearl and Diamond?

285
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:38,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what do you have, Diamond?

286
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Pearl?

287
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm being not like everybody else.

288
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:41,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Pearl, too.

289
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:42,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Bah!

290
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You're being like me.

291
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Bah!

292
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:43,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Yourself.

293
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:45,082
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm being different.

294
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:45,863
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's fine.

295
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you having fun with your Pokemans?

296
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:48,724
[SPEAKER_02]: At the gym, yes.

297
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:49,464
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, cool.

298
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:51,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned the fine art of playing Pokemans on the elliptical.

299
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:52,826
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

300
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:54,502
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard.

301
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,283
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX Live Arcades in an Arcade

302
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:46,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

303
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:11,115
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up with Namco and the rave-y soundtrack games?

304
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:13,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco made that Flaming Finger game at Dave & Buster's.

305
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,498
[SPEAKER_04]: They made the Jumpin' Jackpot game.

306
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,420
[SPEAKER_04]: There's rave whores that work.

307
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,102
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all on Ecstasy over there or something.

308
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:21,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever.

309
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:26,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man Championship Edition and also I played Prince of Persia Classic.

310
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:28,109
[SPEAKER_04]: The game looks beautiful.

311
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:29,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the way they redid the graphics.

312
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,411
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best...

313
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:32,945
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

314
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:04,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Checking out the chat room, www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Click on chat or you can go directly to chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com We tape live on Sunday nights.

315
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:05,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

316
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:10,797
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackDevilerX agrees with Loki's I want to see Xbox Live Arcade in an arcade.

317
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:11,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'd be cool.

318
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:12,479
[SPEAKER_04]: They should.

319
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,180
[SPEAKER_04]: TheRobD says, I hate Flaming Finger.

320
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And JVmon says, Flaming Finger told Sky to get his flame on.

321
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:19,061
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

322
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:22,022
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the game said, when you start the game, have you played Flaming Finger at Dave & Buster's?

323
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched you play it.

324
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:26,523
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and when you start it, you're playing footsie with my hand.

325
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:31,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you put your money in the game, whatever it says, get your flame on.

326
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is really funny.

327
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:36,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm gay, and you know, they say flaming or whatever.

328
00:20:37,207 --> 00:20:37,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's see.

329
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at what else is going on in chat room.

330
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:41,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

331
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:46,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Gerardimo says, Pokemon Puzzle League sucked because it had no Yoshi.

332
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Making a reference to the old school Tetris Attack.

333
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,423
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 points out there's a Ms.

334
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:55,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man machine at Miggle, Milpitas Golf Land, a very infamous arcade here in California.

335
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:58,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackboy says, I think I need the Fuchsia DS Lite.

336
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:02,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's almost a flaming DS Lite right there, so.

337
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:06,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well that sounds like it's about it for our gaming weeks.

338
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:09,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get into some housekeeping real, real quick.

339
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.

340
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a whole lot of housekeeping.

341
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:44,054
[SPEAKER_04]: A happy 100th episode to Bobby, because he had his 100th episode tonight.

342
00:21:44,355 --> 00:21:47,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So congrats to Bobby Blackwolf, our friend over at AllGames.com.

343
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:56,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of AllGames.com, you can always hear the rebroadcast of our program over there Monday nights at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time.

344
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:57,602
[SPEAKER_04]: They replay our show.

345
00:21:57,642 --> 00:22:03,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's A and B back-to-back, so sometimes you have to wait for Part B on the podcast or audio blog feed for a little while.

346
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:06,587
[SPEAKER_04]: They replay it over there Monday nights and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

347
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:07,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Standard Time.

348
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:09,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into some gaming news.

349
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:14,061
[SPEAKER_04]: We obviously missed a week last week, so Loki, tell us about what we missed.

350
00:22:15,762 --> 00:22:16,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, some stuff.

351
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:24,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the Halo 3 beta ended, so everybody's sad because they have to wait for the Halo 3 actual game to come out.

352
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,789
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, hey, whatever.

353
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:27,909
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a good turnout.

354
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:32,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Bungie was saying that they've clocked so many hours of Halo 3 that they could have

355
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:42,502
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were to create, I guess, one-on-one games using the same amount of time in that beta, they would have 700 years worth of gameplay, so... Go analysts!

356
00:22:43,243 --> 00:22:46,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, other rumors... I played it twice.

357
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:48,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it once.

358
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:48,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I beat you.

359
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:56,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Parappa 3, rumored to be coming to the PS3, and this, of course, is coming from EGM.

360
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:00,698
[SPEAKER_03]: No other information on that other than it's rumored.

361
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of saying, like, duh.

362
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Prince of Persia, the movie.

363
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:08,884
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be coming out July 10th, 2009.

364
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:13,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is excited because it's going to be very Pirates of the Caribbean-like.

365
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hurrah.

366
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:26,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Another updated or upgraded graphic version of Metal Gear Solid 4's Tokyo Game Show trailer has made it online with a little interesting...

367
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:30,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Bit that's missing towards the end.

368
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:36,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people will notice that the PlayStation 3 logo is missing at the very end of the trailer.

369
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:36,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck.

370
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:37,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go again.

371
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:38,168
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming to 360!

372
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:40,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God, this game's coming to 360!

373
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,151
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is coming to the 360!

374
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:44,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Why aren't you people listening to me?

375
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:45,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.

376
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:48,594
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going crazy.

377
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:50,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

378
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:51,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

379
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:54,517
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're ready to announce it on the 360, they will announce it.

380
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:57,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, they probably will, but keep your pants on in the meantime.

381
00:23:57,939 --> 00:23:58,239
[SPEAKER_04]: God.

382
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:05,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And next being announced, coming to film, ultra-generic video game movie 4.

383
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:10,991
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, City of Heroes is going to be adapted to film and TV.

384
00:24:11,592 --> 00:24:16,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I don't know, it's just a parody of all the other superhero things out there.

385
00:24:17,015 --> 00:24:19,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, generic superhero movie, that would be awesome.

386
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:23,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, Mrs. Coming to the DS, hurrah!

387
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:26,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Lego MMO coming in 2008.

388
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,836
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

389
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:31,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition.

390
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Tomb Raider is so fucking awesome.

391
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:34,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo.

392
00:24:34,818 --> 00:24:37,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually coming to the 360, possibly as download content.

393
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:41,400
[SPEAKER_03]: This is coming from readings found on the ESRB's website.

394
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are thinking that's going to be download content, possibly for Tomb Raider Legends.

395
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:46,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

396
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:58,319
[SPEAKER_03]: and Pac-Man Championship Edition was released for the 360 and I guess it's the first actual sequel to Pac-Man, although I do remember there's like Pac-Man... Oh, what?

397
00:24:58,459 --> 00:24:58,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

398
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man, Junior Pac-Man... Oh, no!

399
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:01,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man!

400
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:02,661
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no!

401
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:04,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Those did not have different levels!

402
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:07,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Mania... No, no, wait, wait.

403
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:11,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Pac-Man Junior, though, was admittedly harder because it had the scrolling screen.

404
00:25:13,328 --> 00:25:15,131
[SPEAKER_04]: and it just kind of sucked, generally.

405
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:17,874
[SPEAKER_02]: But Super Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man was awesome.

406
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:19,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, what the fuck about Super Pac-Man?

407
00:25:19,696 --> 00:25:21,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was completely different than Pac-Man.

408
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, it's new, okay?

409
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:25,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

410
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:28,888
[SPEAKER_04]: This is coming from the people that know Pac-Man, the people that made it.

411
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, this is the first Pac-Man with raving.

412
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:32,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it that.

413
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,338
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first rave-alicious Pac-Man game.

414
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:36,080
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's got.

415
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

416
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

417
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:38,403
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucking bought Pac-Man again.

418
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:40,266
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck, you stupid bastard.

419
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:40,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucker.

420
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

421
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has another fucking Game Boy to throw at you, too.

422
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:45,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Dumbass fuck.

423
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so, yeah, it came out.

424
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:48,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

425
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:48,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten bucks.

426
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:49,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy it.

427
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:51,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

428
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:51,535
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

429
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:52,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking my head in shame.

430
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:55,076
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people on my friends list did, dude.

431
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:56,136
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people bought it.

432
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:56,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

433
00:25:56,757 --> 00:26:00,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the next Namco fucking collection comes out, there'll be Pac-Man in that, too.

434
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the next console comes out, there'll be another Pac-Man game.

435
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:06,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people buy Pac-Man.

436
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sighing, Jamie.

437
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you sighing?

438
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:09,455
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

439
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you not play Pac-Man World?

440
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:36,227
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it'd be like the Pac-Man family from the cartoon.

441
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, and there was that side-scrolling Pac-Man game.

442
00:26:38,989 --> 00:26:41,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember at Glass Gaming Expo, I bought that.

443
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:43,092
[SPEAKER_04]: You did?

444
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:45,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it for the TurboGrafx.

445
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:45,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You sucker!

446
00:26:47,054 --> 00:26:48,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was the only copy that I have.

447
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:52,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well that makes it all... It's Pac-Land!

448
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Pac-Land.

449
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember playing Pac-Land.

450
00:26:56,521 --> 00:26:57,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, Pac-Land.

451
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:59,942
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be interesting because it's not Pac-Man.

452
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:00,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pac-Land.

453
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:01,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it.

454
00:27:01,362 --> 00:27:02,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, wow, this sucks.

455
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:04,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid MAME.

456
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Making me play crappy games because I don't know what they are.

457
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:09,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you went back to Miss World 96 Nude.

458
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:09,745
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

459
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:14,126
[SPEAKER_02]: If ever you want the ultimate MAME experience, you just play Blazing Star.

460
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:20,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to introduce our special guest tonight who came in a little bit late there while Loki was doing his story.

461
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is your first time in the studio, right?

462
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last time I went here was in...

463
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:27,654
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

464
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:54,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.

465
00:27:55,086 --> 00:27:56,067
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be cosplaying.

466
00:27:56,148 --> 00:27:57,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Sexy Nojuku Iruga.

467
00:28:11,695 --> 00:28:18,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I know where people are going to know you from, Explicit, is your cosplay from Fanime this year, which is actually when I told you.

468
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,080
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the greatest ever.

469
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I ran into you, I said, you need to come back on the show.

470
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them what you cosplayed as.

471
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:25,143
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

472
00:28:26,784 --> 00:28:31,387
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who did not go to FanimeCon, I was the one who dressed up as the Wiimote.

473
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,861
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw you walking by when we were heading back to the hotel room.

474
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, dude, is that a Wiimote?

475
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I said to somebody, I'm like, that's explicit.

476
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:42,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember him when he used to come on the show?

477
00:28:43,002 --> 00:28:43,442
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't there.

478
00:28:43,663 --> 00:28:44,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I was walking.

479
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I was with somebody.

480
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,223
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been Ranma or somebody.

481
00:28:46,243 --> 00:28:47,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, that's explicit.

482
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:48,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, was it you, Matt?

483
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:48,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's it.

484
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:49,424
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

485
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:50,064
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.

486
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:50,704
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

487
00:28:50,744 --> 00:28:52,285
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so now you're back.

488
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:56,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were able to exchange numbers and everything, get you back here on the program to give some more FUs.

489
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So feel free to chime in throughout the night.

490
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of games have you been playing recently?

491
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:01,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Any Wii games?

492
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:04,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, instead of a Wii, yep, WarioWare.

493
00:29:04,638 --> 00:29:07,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually trying to get someone to play drunk WarioWare on that.

494
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:09,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, there's an idea for the fifth anniversary.

495
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:11,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

496
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:16,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's, yeah, um, let's see, I've been playing Planet Puzzle League lately.

497
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:20,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I've been trying to get, trying to master all these puzzle games lately.

498
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:21,465
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of it?

499
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:24,087
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually pretty difficult just to master itself.

500
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:29,009
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier, a lot harder than like Tetris or Luminous in which...

501
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:31,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it, but I've only played it once.

502
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:36,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I've just seen that insane video that someone sent me a while ago.

503
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:37,968
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 33x combo.

504
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:39,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang.

505
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:39,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

506
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:41,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that on YouTube somewhere?

507
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's on YouTube somewhere.

508
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you played Puzzle Quest?

509
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:45,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was raving about that earlier in the show.

510
00:29:45,891 --> 00:29:46,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest is great.

511
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:47,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not played that yet.

512
00:29:48,572 --> 00:29:51,854
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like role-playing games, you like puzzle games, they made this game for you.

513
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:54,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, they put a little bow on it and said, here, here it is.

514
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:55,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for you.

515
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:58,697
[SPEAKER_04]: For DS, PSP, and supposedly Xbox Live Arcade.

516
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:01,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember us doing a story that it's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

517
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, just get the DS or PSP.

518
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I have a friend that says the PSP version looks a lot better.

519
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:08,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen it myself yet.

520
00:30:08,802 --> 00:30:09,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm content with the DS one.

521
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:11,944
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

522
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:12,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick your poison.

523
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:13,185
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

524
00:30:13,225 --> 00:30:15,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so Explicit, ladies and gentlemen, is here.

525
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,287
[SPEAKER_04]: So feel free to chime in whenever you like.

526
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:19,628
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to get to this week's news.

527
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:23,330
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki, if you wouldn't mind starting us off with a little piece of the news from this week.

528
00:30:23,911 --> 00:30:25,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, a piece of the news.

529
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:35,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know, if you've been listening to all games, you've probably heard about it, but Sony has officially announced the agency for PC and the PS3.

530
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:39,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a brand new spy-themed MMO.

531
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:42,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Not exactly like Spy vs. Spy, but still pretty awesome.

532
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:45,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.

533
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I don't know.

534
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:48,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it, Loki?

535
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:49,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

536
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:51,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to be cool.

537
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:52,513
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you know?

538
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:53,294
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I know?

539
00:30:53,474 --> 00:30:54,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the screenshots look cool.

540
00:30:54,835 --> 00:30:58,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've got two people firing guns at a bunch of people with guns.

541
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's all you need is guns and people firing guns.

542
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

543
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,101
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

544
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:04,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And he has a parachute.

545
00:31:05,002 --> 00:31:06,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there fire, yes or no?

546
00:31:07,564 --> 00:31:08,964
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gunfire, muzzle flash.

547
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:09,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

548
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:12,467
[SPEAKER_03]: That little spot on the ground looks like it might be fire.

549
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's got fire, but I don't know.

550
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:16,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty cool.

551
00:31:17,915 --> 00:31:26,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as long as it's not like, you know, she spies or something like that.

552
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:28,258
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so random.

553
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:31,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, doesn't this like hook up with the PC?

554
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's like Shadowrun or something?

555
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I thought I heard something about that.

556
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets the hook up.

557
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:37,370
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, can't you play, like, with the PC people?

558
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:44,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's an MMO, so I would imagine... Is it across the two platforms, or is it that they're just separate entities?

559
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the impression you could play across both platforms.

560
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:47,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's cross-platform.

561
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:48,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Shadowrun.

562
00:31:49,018 --> 00:31:49,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it should.

563
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:56,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the PS3's fucking supposedly powerful enough to run this shit, so, I mean, why couldn't they do cross-platform?

564
00:31:57,142 --> 00:31:57,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think it is.

565
00:31:58,323 --> 00:32:01,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like live, you know, where it's their own self-contained network.

566
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:04,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Sony, do whatever, yeah.

567
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:06,523
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

568
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:28,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something like, you know, here's something to wait for.

569
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:29,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like Killzone 2.

570
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:32,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Killzone 2's coming next year.

571
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:37,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, great, that's awesome that it's coming next year, but we're talking now.

572
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:41,410
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like saying, you know, back when the 360 launched, ooh, but the PlayStation 3's coming out.

573
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, goody for them, but it's not out right now.

574
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:51,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's just like, you know, I'm gonna, well, I'm gonna bring my friends, they're gonna beat you up, so, meh.

575
00:32:53,384 --> 00:32:56,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to the chat room and looking at the comments there.

576
00:32:56,605 --> 00:33:00,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Bandit says, I'd rather play a She-Ra video game other than that.

577
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I bet a She-Ra game would be great.

578
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:04,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, a She-Ra game would be pretty fucking badass.

579
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:06,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like uber-barbarian chickly.

580
00:33:07,348 --> 00:33:09,729
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully the little wizard guy is hidden somewhere in it.

581
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:13,770
[SPEAKER_04]: GS68 says, PlayStation 3, gimmicks, gimmicks, gimmicks.

582
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:14,690
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Madam Raz.

583
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:20,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And RawSteelUT follows that right up saying, Not as gimmicky as the Wii.

584
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:21,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

585
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:25,465
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackDevilerX says, great, that'll give the PS3 another game.

586
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:30,088
[SPEAKER_04]: And RossDLUT is also rolling his eyes going, ew, cross-platform.

587
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew.

588
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard the cross-platform so far, you know, with Shadowrun's kind of not working.

589
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:41,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give the definitive review on the game because I have not played it.

590
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:44,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to attempt to review a game based on screenshots alone.

591
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: But, word on the street around my blogs and things of that nature is that Shadowrun sucks.

592
00:33:50,384 --> 00:33:51,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, I won't...

593
00:33:52,369 --> 00:34:01,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you expect when you turn a really awesome role-playing game into a fucking hate multiplayer-only games out there?

594
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:03,094
[SPEAKER_03]: That is retarded.

595
00:34:03,757 --> 00:34:06,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to play multiplayer games all the time.

596
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'm in the mood for it, sometimes I'm not.

597
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:12,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Saikun's Making Angry Face in chat says Shadowrun fucking rocks.

598
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:18,628
[SPEAKER_03]: It rocks, but it would have rocked even more as a fucking RPG, like it should be, because it's a RPG.

599
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:27,095
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be, you know, a game that you can do, like, from FASA or something that would be good just multiplayer only would be MechWarrior or something like that.

600
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:27,715
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

601
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:54,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill 5.

602
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:55,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

603
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:56,265
[SPEAKER_04]: You have my attention.

604
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:57,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Might have a U.S.

605
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,126
[SPEAKER_02]: developer.

606
00:34:58,846 --> 00:34:59,767
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could happen.

607
00:34:59,907 --> 00:35:00,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It could not happen.

608
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:02,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know.

609
00:35:02,888 --> 00:35:05,149
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, it could happen, but it could not.

610
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:06,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know.

611
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, rumor.

612
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:10,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking hate stories like that.

613
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:14,073
[SPEAKER_04]: No offense, Jamie, because I know you're just reading what is... I didn't pick it out.

614
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

615
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:17,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're just reading what... Someone picked this like they picked their nose.

616
00:35:17,294 --> 00:35:22,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're just reading what all the video game blogs are reporting on this week, which is fine, but... This is not news!

617
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,854
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not news!

618
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:28,415
[SPEAKER_02]: La la la, I could hear once.

619
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:29,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

620
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:35,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we all know that Silent Hill 5 is coming out soon.

621
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:45,420
[SPEAKER_04]: But to hear that it might have a developer that might be doing this with it, how is that news?

622
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,680
[SPEAKER_03]: What's even better is it may or may not.

623
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:53,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, thank you for covering all sides of possibilities right there, because there were only two.

624
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:54,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It may or may not.

625
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:56,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It sorta does.

626
00:35:56,445 --> 00:36:01,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't have like... You can't have 50% on that.

627
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:07,376
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a US developer that's right on the border of Mexico or something like that.

628
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,397
[SPEAKER_03]: They're built on the border.

629
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So half of them are Mexican, half of them are in the US.

630
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's halfway true.

631
00:36:13,022 --> 00:36:16,085
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's being done by the Hawaiian division.

632
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:18,510
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

633
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,671
[SPEAKER_04]: They all got sent out to sea, didn't you hear?

634
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:23,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no wonder why the game's not going to get finished.

635
00:36:23,272 --> 00:36:25,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, since Hawaii, some guy's like, what the fuck is this?

636
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Pyramid Headwind Snorkeling, you'll just have to deal.

637
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:32,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill, Extreme Beach Volleyball.

638
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,516
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if this is...

639
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:38,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the nurses are pretty hot, actually.

640
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:47,190
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if this is what the news is going to be like this week, then seriously, Orange Lounge Radio has been preempted this week for the Dead or Alive movie discussion.

641
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.

642
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:52,951
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

643
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Fighter 2 movie.

644
00:36:56,852 --> 00:36:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

645
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:59,012
[SPEAKER_02]: That movie was all about Kylie Minogue.

646
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:00,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That movie killed Raul Julia.

647
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:03,653
[SPEAKER_02]: It was his last movie, that's true.

648
00:37:04,671 --> 00:37:05,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It killed him.

649
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:08,475
[SPEAKER_02]: He could have had... Not even the life support suit could bring him back.

650
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:15,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of more years left, and that movie's just like... He didn't even go... That's so rude!

651
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:17,383
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't even go Psycho Crusher once.

652
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:19,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't he have an HBO movie, actually?

653
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:21,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that didn't count.

654
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:22,908
[SPEAKER_04]: That he won awards for.

655
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:24,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That movie was Clint Eastwood, wasn't it?

656
00:37:25,407 --> 00:37:28,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I just bought the Addams Family on DVD right before I left for New York.

657
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:30,630
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Raul Julia at his finest.

658
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,471
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I prefer to remember him.

659
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:33,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Addams Family is fucking awesome.

660
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And Addams Family values.

661
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:42,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then SSJ100 Matt comes up with the perfect witty retort that only our chat room can come up with.

662
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:45,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Pyramid Head snorkels and gets taken out by a stingray barb.

663
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:48,698
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just lovely.

664
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:49,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Too soon.

665
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:50,239
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

666
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:54,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Pyramid Head would probably just poke the thing with his big pointy head.

667
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:55,713
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

668
00:37:56,133 --> 00:37:57,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, I don't have to work tomorrow.

669
00:37:57,274 --> 00:37:58,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go get some liquor, I think.

670
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,355
[SPEAKER_04]: This might help me through tonight's show.

671
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,176
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't help me through tonight's show, Bob!

672
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:04,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You want some?

673
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:05,777
[SPEAKER_03]: You drove, though.

674
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:06,197
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't.

675
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to go get some root beer.

676
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:11,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the nice root beer, and it fucking wasn't there.

677
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice root beer!

678
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,480
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not that.

679
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,220
[SPEAKER_03]: That's diet shit.

680
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Diet is never nice.

681
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:18,822
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all they have is fucking vanilla cream.

682
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:19,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate cream soda!

683
00:38:20,222 --> 00:38:20,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate it!

684
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:22,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Hate it, hate it, hate it!

685
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:26,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there a video game show here once, or was it just me?

686
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:28,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Root Beer Tapper.

687
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:29,270
[SPEAKER_03]: See, it ties in.

688
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not deviating from the show's plan.

689
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:36,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I am talking about video games, or at least one step into video games.

690
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm going to read this story so I can go get some booze.

691
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

692
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:42,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

693
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:47,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is actually... This is real news, actually.

694
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:48,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony...

695
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:52,310
[SPEAKER_04]: finally got themselves an official blog.

696
00:38:53,013 --> 00:38:54,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give Sony a round of applause.

697
00:38:56,991 --> 00:39:01,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Sony, you finally caught on and you got yourselves a blog.

698
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:06,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You finally figured out, hey, maybe that Major Nelson, he seems to stay in touch with the community pretty good.

699
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:08,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360 seems to know what they're doing with the community.

700
00:39:08,297 --> 00:39:12,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo, they have Reggie, very likable, very personable guy.

701
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken Kutaragi, crayon eater.

702
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,800
[SPEAKER_04]: So what can we do?

703
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So they finally launched a blog.

704
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:18,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Sony.

705
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:22,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can read it for yourself, blog.us.playstation.com.

706
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:30,869
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, at least this one's not faking the blee, you know, the be a, like an independent blog, like, was it that all I want for Christmas is a PSP shit?

707
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:32,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is actually fairly well done.

708
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is really what I think folks have been asking for.

709
00:39:36,092 --> 00:39:38,253
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some articles here, they're, they're pretty honest.

710
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:46,616
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy who is the US producer for Motorstorm is talking about the patch and how the 1.2 is going to have this time attack mode.

711
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:49,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And then talking about how there's a bug in the game.

712
00:39:49,497 --> 00:39:52,338
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another post that was talking about the PS3 firmware update 1.81.

713
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:58,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And they kind of have like a buffet of people, so to speak, writing for it.

714
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,741
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually not bad.

715
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:01,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So good job, Sony.

716
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:05,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a little late in getting here, but I guess it was worth waiting for.

717
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:05,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

718
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:07,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

719
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:07,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Better late than never.

720
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, that's very true.

721
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:10,332
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

722
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:31,315
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably no thanks to the fact that the PlayStation 3 software development kit got leaked a couple weeks ago out on the internet.

723
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:33,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that only helps things along.

724
00:40:33,676 --> 00:40:48,062
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've started with actually allowing... Apparently, versions 1.1 and 1.11 of the PS3 firmwares can now access, I guess, burnt game ISOs where you can...

725
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:51,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But it won't play them yet.

726
00:40:51,891 --> 00:41:01,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's the first step in getting backwards compatibility with some burn games or possibly, I don't know, Piracy.

727
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:03,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of pirated games.

728
00:41:03,854 --> 00:41:04,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Homebrew.

729
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:10,715
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, nothing's coming of it, but they're working on it.

730
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:15,116
[SPEAKER_03]: But Sony has this to say about it.

731
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,217
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like the fact that people want to...

732
00:41:18,683 --> 00:41:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

733
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:36,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone's going to try to run an old Sega CD game.

734
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:36,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

735
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:36,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I would.

736
00:41:36,592 --> 00:41:38,434
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, I have old Sega CD games.

737
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:04,841
[SPEAKER_03]: They claim that they're serious, which means that they're in serious trouble.

738
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:08,082
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to be able to do crap.

739
00:42:08,202 --> 00:42:14,384
[SPEAKER_03]: If the PS3 is so easy to crack this long, how many fucking updates have there been to the damn firmware?

740
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:17,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's only a matter of time before they crack it.

741
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:25,507
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not interested in going online and stuff, I would recommend keeping your firmware as low as possible.

742
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,868
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in that piracy stuff.

743
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:32,364
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as Homebrew, though, I mean, hello, you can install Linux on it.

744
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:38,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you want to play old SNES games, you can fucking put it on Yellow Dog Linux.

745
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:40,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So, who cares?

746
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:42,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

747
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have better news than that.

748
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:47,372
[SPEAKER_02]: This is happy news, because I love the 80s.

749
00:42:49,107 --> 00:42:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero Encore has more tracks listed, which is like super happy.

750
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:59,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have Hold On Loosely that was, well, all of these, but like one that I'm going to name was a cover.

751
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:02,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one that's not a cover is The Warrior by Scandal.

752
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:15,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the covers are Hold On Loosely from 38 Special, No One Like You by The Scorpions, Only a Lad, Oingo Boingo, it's a cool song, Radar Love by White Lion, Ballroom Blitz by Crocus, a great name.

753
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:17,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Ballroom Blitz is awesome.

754
00:43:17,944 --> 00:43:18,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I like this song.

755
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:19,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I just always laugh at the band's name.

756
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:25,007
[SPEAKER_02]: What I Like About You by The Romantics and Rough Child by Iron Maiden because Iron Maiden's fucking awesome.

757
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:33,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And others on the list, 18 and Life, Bathroom Wall, Lonely is the Night, Nothing But a Good Time.

758
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Poison, Play With Me, Shaken.

759
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:38,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I love Eddie, but it's like my favorite Eddie Money song ever.

760
00:43:39,932 --> 00:43:44,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Synchronicity 2, I Wanna Rock, I Ran, of course, The Black Seagulls.

761
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the actual song too, so is the Twisted Sister one.

762
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:55,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Round and Round, I Want Candy, Metal Health, Holy Diver, and Heat of the Moment.

763
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:59,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about Guitar Heroes Rock Series?

764
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:00,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah!

765
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my 80s rock.

766
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went to go make some liquor, and I don't have a lot to pick from because I didn't stock up before tonight's show.

767
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:10,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I mixed Malibu rum and root beer.

768
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,176
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think that's going to turn out?

769
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:12,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me.

770
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:13,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I haven't tried it yet.

771
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:14,518
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to try it first?

772
00:44:14,638 --> 00:44:15,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be your sample.

773
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:16,178
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, try that.

774
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:17,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't spill it on your laptop, for God's sake.

775
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:22,061
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some bizarre shit.

776
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:23,742
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes like Dr. Pepper, which is nasty.

777
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:24,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

778
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:26,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything tastes like Dr. Pepper when you mix it with alcohol.

779
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:27,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try this.

780
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:32,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of does taste like Dr. Pepper.

781
00:44:32,455 --> 00:44:33,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not too bad.

782
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:36,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hate Dr. Pepper, so I'm finishing off my root beer.

783
00:44:36,418 --> 00:44:38,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Pepper is just a combination of everything.

784
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,862
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what's still in my fridge, by the way, Rob?

785
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:41,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

786
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:43,404
[SPEAKER_02]: The bottle of pineapple Malibu from Fatime.

787
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:44,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Delicious.

788
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:47,447
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackDevilerX wants to know, Sky, what kind of root beer?

789
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Diet IBC.

790
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:53,572
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I mixed it with Malibu because that's all I had.

791
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I had that and citrus vodka, and I knew that would be really bad.

792
00:44:57,475 --> 00:44:58,776
[SPEAKER_02]: You should mix the vodka and the Malibu.

793
00:44:59,617 --> 00:45:00,238
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, we'll see.

794
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Drink that like a shot.

795
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do a video game story, please?

796
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:03,882
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

797
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:04,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

798
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:05,823
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

799
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:08,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the PlayStation 3.

800
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:15,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that you may have heard that somewhere before, or it was soon after Retracted, but we can officially...

801
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:22,176
[SPEAKER_04]: With permission, tell you now, that Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the PlayStation 3 with a GunCon controller.

802
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:30,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Famitsu, they were the first to break this news about Time Crisis 4 coming to the PlayStation 3.

803
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You hadn't heard it anywhere before then.

804
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:40,141
[SPEAKER_04]: The PlayStation 3 version will have an arcade mode, and it's just going to be just like the arcade game, which is pretty awesome.

805
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:44,302
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you like Time Crisis, you're going to be really excited about this game, I'm sure.

806
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:48,063
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a GunCon controller that's coming out with this, which is kind of ugly.

807
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:50,063
[SPEAKER_04]: It's orange and kind of looks like the Zapper.

808
00:45:50,423 --> 00:45:52,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as ugly as the dude holding it.

809
00:45:52,223 --> 00:45:53,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that guy is fugly.

810
00:45:53,623 --> 00:45:54,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's cool, though?

811
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:54,744
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

812
00:45:54,804 --> 00:45:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading that they're going to have first-person shooter portions of the game.

813
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:01,645
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the GunCon is so weird-looking.

814
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:02,525
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool, though.

815
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:25,349
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently they're going to have it functions like the Wii you put these things on the left or right side of your TV kind of like how on the Wii you have the LED bar and then there's a camera inside the actual gun and that determines where the markers are at so that means that way you can use the gun con whether you have an LCD a plasma whatever it'll work on any type of TV which is good news what's kind of neat though and I mean

816
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:28,413
[SPEAKER_03]: GunCon games are out there.

817
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:29,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really not that many.

818
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:39,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this would be awesome for first-person shooters because you've got, basically, on the front grip of the gun, you have kind of the second half of a PlayStation controller.

819
00:46:40,157 --> 00:46:46,659
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got your own analog stick and two shoulder buttons, and then on the back of the gun, there's another analog stick right by the trigger.

820
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:55,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in a sense, this would be the perfect solution for, you know, gun games or first-person shooters.

821
00:46:55,472 --> 00:46:56,093
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

822
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:20,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so, sure.

823
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:22,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, you got it.

824
00:47:22,247 --> 00:47:23,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Upgraded Duck Hunt.

825
00:47:23,268 --> 00:47:24,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Duck Hunt 2, coming out.

826
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:36,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny story, I heard that, I'm not sure about Duck Hunt, but I heard that some old NES Zapper games, you could actually get perfect scores by aiming the light gun at a light and just keep shooting at the light.

827
00:47:36,377 --> 00:47:38,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Or put a magnifying glass in front of the light gun.

828
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:39,419
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the other trick.

829
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:42,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Works like a charm.

830
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:44,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, so there it is.

831
00:47:44,503 --> 00:47:48,025
[SPEAKER_04]: GunCon Time Crisis 3, coming to the PlayStation 3 very soon.

832
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:48,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

833
00:47:49,342 --> 00:47:53,345
[SPEAKER_03]: and another thing that was announced for PlayStation... Wake me up when they have point blank, that's all I have to say.

834
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:53,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

835
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:54,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

836
00:47:54,746 --> 00:48:03,953
[SPEAKER_03]: For PlayStation 3 and for the 360, Soul Calibur 4, because we knew that Soul Calibur Legends couldn't be possibly the only game coming out.

837
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:06,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul Calibur 4 will be coming out.

838
00:48:07,235 --> 00:48:11,018
[SPEAKER_03]: They claim that's going to be 60 frames per second.

839
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:15,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I read somewhere 90 frames per second, which would be stupid, but...

840
00:48:17,203 --> 00:48:23,029
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also that it's going to possibly be 1080p.

841
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:31,557
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, apparently, everybody's been talking about certain characters getting boob upgrades in the game.

842
00:48:31,657 --> 00:48:33,179
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a fucking game, folks.

843
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:40,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But the teaser video that they had for it didn't really reveal too much because it was just still shots, so...

844
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:51,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm just glad, you know, I know most games we joke about are obvious that they're coming, like Silent Hill 5, Final Fantasy 14 someday, you know, and all these other series.

845
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:59,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't 100% for sure that there was going to be another Soul Calibur game, because I got sworn they said with this last one, that's it, kids.

846
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:02,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fact that, you know, the arcade release came later.

847
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:11,567
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a comment on Sony's website saying that Soul Calibur 3 was exclusive for PS2 and any future Soul Calibur games.

848
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:16,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, what's the decision, what happened with the decision with Soul Calibur 4 being multi-console now?

849
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:24,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you see what happened is that Microsoft actually sold consoles, so that's why the decision was made to go multi-platform, I guess.

850
00:49:24,734 --> 00:49:27,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be the 4 million console leave that they have.

851
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:32,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Or there's this whole rumor thing, I mean, because Sony or the fanboys are writing the hate mail right now, but also look at this, is that

852
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:42,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco, and you know, you'll see this throughout some other stories you may hear tonight or may not, is that Namco and Microsoft are starting to be in bed together, you might notice.

853
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:54,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, if you look at some of the decisions they've made recently and some of the things, I mean, not that they've abandoned PlayStation 3, but look at like, you know, Ace Combat and some of these other things, you know, Namco's kind of, you know...

854
00:49:55,518 --> 00:49:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

855
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:20,074
[SPEAKER_04]: with the Dreamcast thing.

856
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:21,474
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Dreamcast fishing rod.

857
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:22,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Rod caliber.

858
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You just told that story like last time we had a show.

859
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:28,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but every time I think of Soul Calibur, I think of Rod Calibur and how great it is.

860
00:50:29,398 --> 00:50:29,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

861
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:32,520
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a new fishing controller for more Rod Calibur fun.

862
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about Ivy and how great she is.

863
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:44,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about trying to play Soul Calibur on the DDR pad on Dreamcast and the only analog button was like the Konami logo.

864
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:47,968
[SPEAKER_04]: You're tapping your fingers like you want to say something, Loki.

865
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:50,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not tapping my fingers because I want to sing.

866
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:51,313
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a nervous twitch.

867
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,819
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because I'm on my third Pepsi.

868
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't drink by yourself.

869
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't drink lots of water.

870
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and please don't drink lots of water and not pee.

871
00:51:25,422 --> 00:51:28,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't sit on the ground drinking nothing but, what, vodka and orange juice?

872
00:51:29,104 --> 00:51:29,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there.

873
00:51:29,745 --> 00:51:30,665
[SPEAKER_04]: There's your disclaimer.

874
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:31,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to news.

875
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:34,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on Soul Calibur?

876
00:51:34,288 --> 00:51:34,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

877
00:51:35,328 --> 00:51:35,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

878
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:36,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Explicit.

879
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, the Rod Calibur?

880
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:42,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the DDR pad on Soul Calibur.

881
00:51:43,374 --> 00:51:44,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.

882
00:51:44,775 --> 00:51:49,198
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost as bizarre as someone trying to perform Shoryuken on a Street Fighter with the DDR pad.

883
00:51:49,218 --> 00:51:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Seen it happen.

884
00:51:50,018 --> 00:51:50,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Seen it done.

885
00:51:52,096 --> 00:51:57,378
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually is much easier to do that with the DDR pad.

886
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:01,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try some of those Xbox Live Arcade games I didn't like.

887
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try Nova Drone with the DDR pad and see if it's more fun.

888
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:05,283
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

889
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

890
00:52:07,464 --> 00:52:07,584
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

891
00:52:07,804 --> 00:52:08,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

892
00:52:08,464 --> 00:52:10,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if I drink a few more it'll be fine.

893
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:12,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

894
00:52:14,308 --> 00:52:17,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an excellent idea for some of these crappy games out there.

895
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:19,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an excellent idea for...

896
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:21,523
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

897
00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:22,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Skeet shooting?

898
00:52:24,785 --> 00:52:26,426
[SPEAKER_03]: For the ultimate endurance test.

899
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:27,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it that way.

900
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:27,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

901
00:52:27,587 --> 00:52:30,749
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Janai's in chat and says, all video games are shit.

902
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:31,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Play with a jump rope.

903
00:52:33,131 --> 00:52:34,872
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be listening to the wrong show, buddy.

904
00:52:35,272 --> 00:52:36,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to tell you.

905
00:52:38,314 --> 00:52:40,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, Microsoft would say jump in, so...

906
00:52:41,664 --> 00:52:48,291
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun says you can kind of play Street Fighter on a 2DX controller.

907
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:51,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't go left.

908
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:52,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

909
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So just be player one?

910
00:52:55,299 --> 00:53:00,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so, and hope that player two never thinks to jump over you or else you're fucked.

911
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:02,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.

912
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:02,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

913
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:23,626
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who are keeping up with the PS1 games that were to be coming out on the PSN, PlayStation Store, or whatever the hell they're calling it, we have Crash Bandicoot, Wipeout, Medieval, Jumping Flash, and Syphon Filter that will be available on, looks like next Friday.

914
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:26,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, is it this Friday?

915
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: No, take that back, next Friday, sorry.

916
00:53:29,696 --> 00:53:34,517
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be available for PS3 and PSP, but you can only buy them from the PS3 store.

917
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:37,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing that's for the UK.

918
00:53:37,558 --> 00:53:38,258
[SPEAKER_02]: For the UK, yes.

919
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:38,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

920
00:53:38,658 --> 00:53:39,138
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.

921
00:53:39,818 --> 00:53:46,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Also going to be available is on 22nd June, there will be Calling All Cars and Super Stardust HD on June 29th.

922
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:48,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard Calling All Cars sucks.

923
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that, Dave Jeff.

924
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't like to say that anything sucks until I've actually either seen it in play or have played it myself.

925
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:00,759
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think I'm going to pass judgment before I play it.

926
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I actually do that a lot, actually.

927
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I'm wrong.

928
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote off Halo.

929
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:10,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I will never like that game.

930
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:12,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't liked a first-person shooter since Quake.

931
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:13,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo's going to suck.

932
00:54:13,742 --> 00:54:18,202
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I actually played it at, get this, my friend's wedding reception.

933
00:54:18,482 --> 00:54:20,503
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a Halo-themed wedding reception.

934
00:54:20,663 --> 00:54:21,323
[SPEAKER_06]: That's brilliant.

935
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:24,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had TVs all land together and played Halo.

936
00:54:24,063 --> 00:54:25,824
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually had a cake with Master Chief on it.

937
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:28,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the first time I ever played Halo, and I had a blast.

938
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:33,738
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't always judge by looking, but some of the time you can.

939
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the time you really can.

940
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:37,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know why I can't play Halo.

941
00:54:37,825 --> 00:54:38,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the motion sickness thing?

942
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:39,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

943
00:54:39,368 --> 00:54:39,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to hear it.

944
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:41,717
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX 360 SAINTS ROW

945
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:29,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadowrun also coming out in Japan and some other games coming to the Asian region such as Vampire Reign also I want to point out Def Jam Icon also comes out from EA on the Xbox 360 all on June 21st also coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 21st is Hajime no Ippo Revolution which looks to be another type of anime based video game oh no it's a sports title it's a boxing title yeah it's actually what it is so first

946
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:30,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Something.

947
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:31,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of cool.

948
00:55:51,937 --> 00:55:52,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Combo

949
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:20,170
[SPEAKER_04]: That's F-U-U-U-N Super Combo.

950
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:25,593
[SPEAKER_04]: This actually just looks like a Neo Geo compilation of some of the games there that SNK put out previously.

951
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:27,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet they're pretty fun!

952
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:28,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet they are fun!

953
00:56:28,834 --> 00:56:30,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be fun unless Psycho Soldier is one of them.

954
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:34,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots and lots of SNK loving this week in Japan, by the way.

955
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:37,379
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a King of Fighters thing coming out, too.

956
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,601
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you're on the DS...

957
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Have I Got News For You.

958
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:44,932
[SPEAKER_04]: This could be the game of the year right here.

959
00:56:45,352 --> 00:56:48,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello Kitty, No Gatuchi Collection.

960
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Koi No Doki Doki Trouble is coming out.

961
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:56,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And the box is beautifully pink with Hello Kitty wearing a bunny suit.

962
00:56:57,055 --> 00:56:58,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she's confused.

963
00:56:58,855 --> 00:57:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is made by Rocket Company, not SNK.

964
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:02,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's on the Nintendo DS.

965
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:04,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom vs. SNK Cardfighter

966
00:57:34,261 --> 00:57:36,103
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

967
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:03,154
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 2, The Adventures of Darwin

968
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:38,922
[SPEAKER_03]: On Xbox 360, we have Dirt coming out, which is an awesome off-road racing game, so definitely check that out.

969
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:45,948
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP, PQ2, remember those old IQ games, this one should be pretty cool.

970
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:52,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot Brain is going to be coming out on the PSP, another brain training sim.

971
00:58:52,714 --> 00:58:53,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzlescape,

972
00:58:53,925 --> 00:58:55,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Another puzzle game.

973
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:57,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Maker, Hunting Ground.

974
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:01,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting role-playing game with a little bit of sim aspects in there.

975
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:03,408
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be coming out as well.

976
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:08,350
[SPEAKER_03]: On PlayStation 3, you got a big, fat nothing.

977
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:13,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Six Vegas was going to be coming out this week, but once again, it's been delayed yet another week.

978
00:59:14,893 --> 00:59:15,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

979
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:21,035
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is going to be making its way out, so that's going to be pretty cool.

980
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:27,964
[SPEAKER_03]: and the DS, Time Ace, which is that Konami game that we played that's, I guess, sequel to Time Pilot.

981
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:29,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the only one that kind of pointed that out.

982
00:59:29,848 --> 00:59:33,235
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, Zen Goku, or Zen Doku is going to be coming out.

983
00:59:33,275 --> 00:59:33,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet another...

984
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:38,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Cidoku Game, SimCity DS, Rob, possibly a game that you might want to pick up?

985
00:59:39,093 --> 00:59:39,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe.

986
00:59:40,515 --> 00:59:44,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have World of Warcraft to worry about on top of all the other new crap I've got.

987
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:45,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

988
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Too many games, too many games.

989
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,821
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even Christmas yet.

990
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:51,744
[SPEAKER_03]: The Transformers game is coming out a little bit early for the DS.

991
00:59:52,085 --> 00:59:56,428
[SPEAKER_03]: You have both the Autobots and Decepticons games going to be heading your way.

992
00:59:56,709 --> 00:59:59,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is more than meets the eye to these games.

993
00:59:59,051 --> 00:59:59,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

994
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:04,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally on PC, Dirt is also coming out as well as the Hitman Trilogy.

995
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:15,000
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually putting out, yet again, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, and The Sims Pet Stories will be making its way out.

996
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:17,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodie, goodie.

997
01:00:17,429 --> 01:00:22,252
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I went to the new Fry's Electronics they built out in Roseville, which is all, you know, train themed out there.

998
01:00:22,272 --> 01:00:22,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Very train-alicious.

999
01:00:22,972 --> 01:00:23,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cute.

1000
01:00:23,493 --> 01:00:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cute.

1001
01:00:23,873 --> 01:00:24,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cute store.

1002
01:00:25,374 --> 01:00:31,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the Sacramento Fry's is unlike any other Fry's because it doesn't have a theme, but all the other Fry's around the world have themes.

1003
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:37,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, the point is, I was looking at computer games just randomly because I was thinking about maybe buying a new computer game.

1004
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:46,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually, I don't know why, I was tempted for like half a second to get the Lord of the Rings MMO, even though I know it's like, I'm like, oh, I kind of want to try it for no good reason.

1005
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:47,708
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't get it.

1006
01:00:47,888 --> 01:00:48,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was looking at computer games.

1007
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:49,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even kidding.

1008
01:00:50,269 --> 01:00:57,090
[SPEAKER_04]: One entire shelf, almost like two actually, dedicated to The Sims and all their spin-off series.

1009
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is one of the best-selling games ever.

1010
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:04,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how many shelves are dedicated to the Tycoon series.

1011
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:05,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want to know.

1012
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:07,772
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

1013
01:01:08,352 --> 01:01:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some different release dates?

1014
01:01:09,672 --> 01:01:10,132
[SPEAKER_02]: How about it?

1015
01:01:10,952 --> 01:01:15,713
[SPEAKER_02]: For our friends in the UK, coming out on the 22nd, we have Calling All Cars, like I said earlier.

1016
01:01:19,935 --> 01:01:33,800
[SPEAKER_02]: HotPixel, Hour of Victory, Kirby Mouse Attack, Mario Party 8, Metroid Prime Pinball, Monster Madness, Pac-Man Rally, Sega Presents Touch Dart, and Cosmic Family.

1017
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:36,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Metroid Prime Pinball just now?

1018
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:39,122
[SPEAKER_04]: You poor kids over in the UK.

1019
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:44,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not that that game was like that great, but seriously, that game came out here what, like six months ago?

1020
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:46,165
[SPEAKER_03]: They get flat out before I do.

1021
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:52,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I want flat out for the 360 so I can launch my driver through the window and into things.

1022
01:01:52,396 --> 01:01:56,139
[SPEAKER_04]: They get one game early and, you know, they're bastards.

1023
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:57,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, they get Tomb Raider early.

1024
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:57,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, okay.

1025
01:01:58,001 --> 01:01:59,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1026
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:01,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you excited about Tomb Raider?

1027
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:06,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.

1028
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about gaming on the Mac, shall we?

1029
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:11,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

1030
01:02:12,873 --> 01:02:17,575
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't always get to talk about this, and Loki usually has a field day with this topic.

1031
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:21,797
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, there was a pretty big keynote done.

1032
01:02:21,857 --> 01:02:22,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I've been drinking.

1033
01:02:22,817 --> 01:02:25,238
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a keynote done by Steve Jobs.

1034
01:02:26,059 --> 01:02:31,741
[SPEAKER_04]: The Worldwide Developers Conference did a keynote, and he talked about at the keynote that there are going to be... Excuse me.

1035
01:02:33,362 --> 01:02:34,703
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very professional, sorry.

1036
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:38,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get sneezed, but there's going to be coughing all over the Macintosh computers.

1037
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:39,945
[SPEAKER_04]: No, here's what's really going on.

1038
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:51,091
[SPEAKER_04]: They announced at the conference that Apple is going to be teaming up with EA and Electronic Arts is actually going to be putting out some of their games onto the Macs.

1039
01:02:51,171 --> 01:02:56,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Command & Conquer 3, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter, and Madden & Tiger Woods 08.

1040
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:57,895
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1041
01:02:58,936 --> 01:02:59,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaming on the Mac.

1042
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:01,878
[SPEAKER_04]: About fucking time.

1043
01:03:02,298 --> 01:03:08,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think they've had some games before this, but EA is definitely stepping it up a notch on the Macintosh, so that's pretty cool.

1044
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:15,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that's being shown off as well is ID's Tech 5 engine.

1045
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:17,596
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be their fifth generation 3D engine.

1046
01:03:18,397 --> 01:03:23,858
[SPEAKER_03]: You might remember them from such games as Quake 4, Doom 3, and all those other fun things.

1047
01:03:25,038 --> 01:03:33,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they said that their new engine will also be able to run on Mac OS X. So that's good.

1048
01:03:33,779 --> 01:03:38,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're actually going to get some pretty decent games on the Mac, finally.

1049
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:48,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also, it says, not being built with Microsoft's DirectX 10, which makes sense because, you know, not everyone wants to have Vista either.

1050
01:03:49,184 --> 01:03:49,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1051
01:03:50,444 --> 01:03:51,525
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1052
01:04:11,946 --> 01:04:15,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Could this be like the next great engine that everybody wants to license?

1053
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:16,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

1054
01:04:16,268 --> 01:04:21,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Doom 3, the Doom 3 engine was, I mean, Quake 4 engine had a lot of things going for it.

1055
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:24,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Quake 4, I think, ran on the Doom 3 engine.

1056
01:04:24,752 --> 01:04:27,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it could be the next big engine.

1057
01:04:27,893 --> 01:04:30,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it does things that Unreal can't.

1058
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:33,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I think Crysis is going to be fucking awesome.

1059
01:04:33,656 --> 01:04:38,338
[SPEAKER_03]: That engine is going to be nuts as far as the amount of detail that's in it.

1060
01:04:38,398 --> 01:04:40,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a real high bar to me.

1061
01:04:41,394 --> 01:04:41,734
[SPEAKER_04]: PC, PC, PC, PC, PC

1062
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:12,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it looks like Capcom is going to start releasing titles through Steam.

1063
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:22,850
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be putting out PC versions of Lost Planet, Onimusha 3, Devil May Cry 3, Special Edition, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.

1064
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:26,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I add for matching service to that, just because I think it's funny?

1065
01:05:27,733 --> 01:05:32,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, but I did not know that the Puzzle Fighter game was coming to the computers.

1066
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did I just miss that in the initial announcement?

1067
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:36,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so.

1068
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:41,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It says here that Capcom PC releases are going to be made available through Steam.

1069
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:42,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

1070
01:05:42,598 --> 01:05:43,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

1071
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:44,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's pretty cool.

1072
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might add that their fucking Street Fighter 2 HD game looks fucking awesome.

1073
01:05:49,426 --> 01:05:52,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that they've set the bar pretty high for

1074
01:05:52,978 --> 01:05:55,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Any new 2D fighting games coming out?

1075
01:05:55,759 --> 01:05:58,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see Guilty Gear in that much detail.

1076
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:07,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It does look pretty hot, but it's going to do the same thing that Pac-Man CE did to Pac-Man on Xbox Live Arcade, is it's going to piss you off that you bought the first one.

1077
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:13,145
[SPEAKER_04]: When the Street Fighter 2 HD version comes out, it's an arcade release, right?

1078
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:14,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1079
01:06:14,725 --> 01:06:18,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to make you mad that you ever bought the Championship Edition release that came out last year.

1080
01:06:19,507 --> 01:06:21,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I have every other version, why not?

1081
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:23,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess so.

1082
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:24,441
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

1083
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:31,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you are a computer gamer, then you certainly know the series Monkey Island.

1084
01:06:31,546 --> 01:06:33,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember this series of games, Monkey Island?

1085
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:34,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about pirates.

1086
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:35,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell yeah.

1087
01:06:37,438 --> 01:06:38,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

1088
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:44,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, going around LucasArts is rumblings of a fifth Monkey Island game.

1089
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:46,880
[SPEAKER_04]: The fifth Monkey Island game is coming.

1090
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:54,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of the guys who worked on the music compositions for the original PC Classics, and they say that it's currently being planned amidst rumors.

1091
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:59,522
[SPEAKER_04]: However, LucasArts has so many things on its belt right now, including a Wii title that is yet to be named.

1092
01:06:59,902 --> 01:07:04,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't expect any revitalations of its classic graphic adventures until 2008 at the earliest.

1093
01:07:04,843 --> 01:07:06,823
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming from RumorReporter.com.

1094
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:10,666
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is a game that needs to be made into a movie.

1095
01:07:11,847 --> 01:07:12,747
[SPEAKER_03]: The Monkey Island series.

1096
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:13,628
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be awesome.

1097
01:07:14,088 --> 01:07:19,693
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, with Sam and Max doing as well as it's doing critically, I mean, there's no reason why they shouldn't bring this back.

1098
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:21,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be kind of interesting to see it on a console.

1099
01:07:21,975 --> 01:07:24,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Although these games will always kind of be PC games to me.

1100
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:26,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1101
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:27,339
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pretty cool, though.

1102
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:33,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we talked about it a while back that, you know, Playboy was going to be coming to Second Life.

1103
01:07:33,785 --> 01:07:36,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they finally opened their doors in a

1104
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:38,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun little bunny-shaped island.

1105
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:44,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And what can you find possibly on the Playboy Island, you may ask?

1106
01:07:44,456 --> 01:07:52,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, plenty of bunny paraphernalia from its site, playboy.com and shopthebunny.com.

1107
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:52,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Fake women.

1108
01:07:53,881 --> 01:07:54,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, fake women.

1109
01:07:55,102 --> 01:08:02,767
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to buy avatars or merchandise for your avatars and also for, you know,

1110
01:08:03,624 --> 01:08:06,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Like fake bunny shirts and fake bunny ears?

1111
01:08:06,786 --> 01:08:09,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can buy real merchandise that can get shipped to your house.

1112
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:11,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

1113
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:13,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So slash Playboy instead of slash pizza.

1114
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:19,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're going to have characters running around dressed up like the classic bunnies.

1115
01:08:20,213 --> 01:08:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat.

1116
01:08:22,634 --> 01:08:26,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I guess they're going to be also doing other events and stuff like that.

1117
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:28,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Events?

1118
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:30,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Pool party!

1119
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:32,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Fake pool party.

1120
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:40,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading some of the comments on the story, and it was kind of funny, because they were like, I'm just going to fake bomb this place.

1121
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:43,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, RawSteelUT read my mind in chat.

1122
01:08:43,712 --> 01:08:45,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you throw cocks at the Playboy models?

1123
01:08:45,974 --> 01:08:46,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can.

1124
01:08:51,558 --> 01:08:51,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Wipe.

1125
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, the cock-throwing story in Second Life was funny.

1126
01:08:57,403 --> 01:08:58,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if it was like four months old?

1127
01:08:58,864 --> 01:08:59,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still funny.

1128
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:00,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda.

1129
01:09:01,185 --> 01:09:01,766
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1130
01:09:03,608 --> 01:09:06,071
[SPEAKER_04]: If I actually played Second Life, I would want to throw some cocks.

1131
01:09:06,632 --> 01:09:08,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on, what am I going to do?

1132
01:09:08,414 --> 01:09:10,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Sit around and pretend I'm at the Playboy Mansion?

1133
01:09:10,637 --> 01:09:12,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I would build the massive cock launcher.

1134
01:09:14,281 --> 01:09:16,143
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a giant cannon.

1135
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:18,026
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it would do.

1136
01:09:18,513 --> 01:09:19,454
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1137
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:47,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks.

1138
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:49,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to go.

1139
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:50,731
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have sent DarkSakura.

1140
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:52,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it was fucking lame.

1141
01:09:53,052 --> 01:09:53,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

1142
01:09:53,412 --> 01:09:54,233
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was at the Playboy Mansion.

1143
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:54,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It was lame.

1144
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:56,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was at the Playboy Mansion.

1145
01:09:56,274 --> 01:10:01,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's for the goddamn, was it the Professional Gaming League?

1146
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to make gaming, they're putting it on TV.

1147
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:06,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why not?

1148
01:10:07,519 --> 01:10:09,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to watch people play games.

1149
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:10,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate that.

1150
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play games or play games against other people.

1151
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to have people watch me play games.

1152
01:10:16,221 --> 01:10:20,201
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of watching basketball on TV, why not go play basketball?

1153
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:21,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1154
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:22,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why I don't watch sports on TV.

1155
01:10:22,622 --> 01:10:23,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're just weird.

1156
01:10:23,982 --> 01:10:26,742
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of people out there that do enjoy watching other people play games.

1157
01:10:27,042 --> 01:10:31,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't you have friends that will come over and sit on the couch and watch you play?

1158
01:10:31,363 --> 01:10:31,403
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1159
01:10:31,783 --> 01:10:33,023
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really want to play themselves.

1160
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,264
[SPEAKER_04]: They just will watch you play.

1161
01:10:34,304 --> 01:10:35,924
[SPEAKER_03]: No one ever comes over to watch me play.

1162
01:10:36,587 --> 01:10:38,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nellie hates watching me play games.

1163
01:10:38,588 --> 01:10:40,968
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I want to watch TV instead.

1164
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:43,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you do this to some extent, right?

1165
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:52,072
[SPEAKER_04]: You've told stories on the show before when you and Dan were gaming together that you would help him through Resident Evil, but you would just be kind of content in watching him, right?

1166
01:10:52,492 --> 01:10:52,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1167
01:10:53,293 --> 01:10:57,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So would it be fair to say some people are okay with just watching people play games?

1168
01:10:58,792 --> 01:10:59,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1169
01:10:59,333 --> 01:10:59,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, great.

1170
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:02,256
[SPEAKER_03]: They can go ahead and start up their professional gaming league.

1171
01:11:02,276 --> 01:11:03,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like the fucking XFL.

1172
01:11:03,818 --> 01:11:08,083
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be around for a couple years, and then it will fade into dust.

1173
01:11:08,584 --> 01:11:11,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it should, because no one wants to watch this shit.

1174
01:11:11,928 --> 01:11:16,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, people, gamers don't even watch... We were actually playing together.

1175
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:17,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1176
01:11:19,502 --> 01:11:23,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that stupid show on G4 Arena, okay?

1177
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:23,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

1178
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, it had an interesting idea.

1179
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:27,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's watch gamers play games.

1180
01:11:28,009 --> 01:11:28,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sucked.

1181
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:29,891
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucked really, really bad.

1182
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:30,331
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why?

1183
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:31,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's watching people play games.

1184
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:36,596
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with Arena was just the way the show was kind of formulated.

1185
01:11:37,717 --> 01:11:38,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was the...

1186
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:41,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1187
01:11:57,475 --> 01:12:07,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Rockstar or something like that so I can watch you play some stupid game that I could be playing right now and win $50,000 and go, I'm fucking awesome.

1188
01:12:07,858 --> 01:12:10,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me make my own keyboard brand and sell it for uber money.

1189
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you done?

1190
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,220
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1191
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm done.

1192
01:12:16,841 --> 01:12:20,042
[SPEAKER_04]: You're such a dick.

1193
01:12:20,182 --> 01:12:21,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God.

1194
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:24,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, RossDLUT brings up an excellent point.

1195
01:12:24,903 --> 01:12:26,324
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Starcade?

1196
01:12:27,407 --> 01:12:55,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Starcade was awesome and you watched other people play games or Nick Arcade for that matter those games rocked bring that shit back I would love to see that that's good but fucking watching clan members or whatever fucking play multiplayer games and shit that's kind of boring but I'd be down for like an 80's style show or something where it's just people facing off in the arcades like their forefathers did so you will watch people play games under the right circumstances

1197
01:12:56,371 --> 01:12:57,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll play arcade games.

1198
01:12:57,953 --> 01:12:58,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Liar.

1199
01:12:59,194 --> 01:12:59,514
Liar.

1200
01:13:01,316 --> 01:13:02,437
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1201
01:13:02,638 --> 01:13:03,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Liar is not the right word.

1202
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:08,303
[SPEAKER_02]: The word I'm thinking of starts with an H. Homosexual?

1203
01:13:08,524 --> 01:13:09,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Hypocrite.

1204
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:10,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hypocrite.

1205
01:13:12,027 --> 01:13:13,489
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Rob, that's just you.

1206
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,949
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1207
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:14,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1208
01:13:15,671 --> 01:13:17,573
[SPEAKER_03]: That show's not on TV anymore, so fuck that.

1209
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:18,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1210
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:19,655
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyhow.

1211
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:23,871
[SPEAKER_04]: and M60... Oh no, I guess GS68 said it first.

1212
01:13:23,911 --> 01:13:24,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Hentai?

1213
01:13:24,591 --> 01:13:25,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the word you were thinking of?

1214
01:13:25,991 --> 01:13:26,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Hentai?

1215
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:43,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Rob... Speaking of hentai, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet every week for yaoiboyfun.com and I don't know what she's looking at, but she likes to... Oh yes, explicit.

1216
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:45,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to YaoiCon?

1217
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:46,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

1218
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:47,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

1219
01:13:48,377 --> 01:13:49,557
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura's website of the week.

1220
01:13:49,577 --> 01:13:50,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a little bit of Yaoi.

1221
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:37,275
[SPEAKER_02]: for those of you guys who don't know what yaoi is it's art that is you explain it DarkSakura I can't it's man on man action imagine like the uber sweet sappy you know typical heterosexual relationship and then change the gender of one of them to male okay

1222
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:39,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Good definition.

1223
01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:42,200
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I understand it, Yaoi is not made for gay men.

1224
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gay porn.

1225
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:44,122
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not gay anime.

1226
01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:45,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It's made for straight girls.

1227
01:14:45,542 --> 01:14:47,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yaoi is made for girls.

1228
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:52,967
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I get asked all the time, because Yaoi is man-on-man action, are you going YaoiCon?

1229
01:14:53,587 --> 01:15:02,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, okay, well as a gay man, the last place I want to be on the planet is a hotel full of horny straight women.

1230
01:15:02,192 --> 01:15:02,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1231
01:15:05,945 --> 01:15:06,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really.

1232
01:15:07,006 --> 01:15:10,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So stop asking me if I'm going to go to YowieCon, because the answer is no.

1233
01:15:13,831 --> 01:15:15,853
[SPEAKER_04]: YuriCon, maybe, because I love my lesbians.

1234
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my lesbians.

1235
01:15:17,634 --> 01:15:19,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Might go to YuriCon, but I don't know about YowieCon.

1236
01:15:19,976 --> 01:15:20,497
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sorry.

1237
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the aside, DarkSakura.

1238
01:15:22,838 --> 01:15:25,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for cutting into your precious website of the week time.

1239
01:15:25,881 --> 01:15:27,062
[SPEAKER_04]: We needed to have some YowieChat.

1240
01:15:27,642 --> 01:15:28,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do your website of the week now?

1241
01:15:29,243 --> 01:15:29,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1242
01:15:29,824 --> 01:15:30,264
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

1243
01:15:30,284 --> 01:15:31,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm just playing with this stupid thing anyway.

1244
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:32,326
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

1245
01:15:40,049 --> 01:15:45,871
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the website of the week is FallingSandGame.com, which I have no idea what the purpose of this game is for anyway.

1246
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:49,713
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really stupid, and all I'm doing is just watching it do shit.

1247
01:15:50,493 --> 01:15:56,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a game from the same people who do Cat with Bo Golf or something.

1248
01:15:58,836 --> 01:16:05,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing other than drawing lines and trying to make this thing destroy my sandslides.

1249
01:16:06,789 --> 01:16:09,069
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that thing that's running around on the outside.

1250
01:16:09,089 --> 01:16:10,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You're supposed to hit it with sand.

1251
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this like Yoshi's Touch and Go?

1252
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:14,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hitting it with sand, and it's not doing anything.

1253
01:16:15,651 --> 01:16:16,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you sure this game is fun?

1254
01:16:17,251 --> 01:16:18,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it explodes.

1255
01:16:18,891 --> 01:16:24,013
[SPEAKER_03]: They have one that's also with slugs, and you have to pour salt on them.

1256
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:25,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate slugs.

1257
01:16:25,253 --> 01:16:27,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually slug-phobic, people.

1258
01:16:28,493 --> 01:16:30,054
[SPEAKER_02]: You now know what my deepest fear is.

1259
01:16:30,134 --> 01:16:30,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Slugs.

1260
01:16:31,614 --> 01:16:32,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And snails.

1261
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I keep pouring sand on it.

1262
01:16:34,435 --> 01:16:36,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the type of sand I'm using.

1263
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:51,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Grossant I want the sea monkey to gain Or that I can flush them down the toilet That's the only thing missing from Sims 2 Pets Funerals?

1264
01:16:52,404 --> 01:16:54,764
[SPEAKER_03]: No, flushing animals down the toilet Funerals!

1265
01:16:55,464 --> 01:16:56,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Fish funerals!

1266
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:58,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when I had fish?

1267
01:16:58,265 --> 01:17:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fantastic I prefer to call them funerals It's just like, what the hell is this crap?

1268
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:05,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, give that URL one more time

1269
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: FallingSandGame.com Dude, I just set the ball of sand on fire.

1270
01:17:10,703 --> 01:17:11,124
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1271
01:17:11,144 --> 01:17:11,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I move on?

1272
01:17:11,484 --> 01:17:12,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you finished?

1273
01:17:12,444 --> 01:17:12,945
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is great.

1274
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:18,768
[SPEAKER_04]: What is up with you people tonight and not being able to finish in a reasonable amount of time?

1275
01:17:18,788 --> 01:17:19,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I am paying attention.

1276
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:36,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm playing with the Sand Game.

1277
01:17:36,959 --> 01:17:39,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I talk about BlizzCon while you're playing with the Sand Game?

1278
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:39,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1279
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:41,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm a little upset about this.

1280
01:17:42,243 --> 01:17:47,227
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, I've been gone for the past two weeks, and during that time, tickets for BlizzCon went on sale.

1281
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:50,910
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually was going to go to BlizzCon this year.

1282
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:57,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I get home and find out that the tickets went on sale June 13th, and then promptly sold out on June 15th.

1283
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:02,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So, tickets for BlizzCon 2007 already sold out.

1284
01:18:02,472 --> 01:18:05,673
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't heard, it's August 3rd and 4th at the Anaheim Convention Center.

1285
01:18:06,354 --> 01:18:08,515
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if you go, you're supposed to get all this free stuff.

1286
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:11,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I, however, will not be going, and I'm a little bit bitter about it.

1287
01:18:13,237 --> 01:18:14,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to cry?

1288
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:15,398
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

1289
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:16,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I'm not going to cry.

1290
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:17,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get angsty.

1291
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what happens on this show when people get angsty?

1292
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,360
[SPEAKER_04]: FUs of the week time.

1293
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,621
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, start us off.

1294
01:18:33,661 --> 01:18:37,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get the information out of my purse because I'm going to tell people exactly where the fuck I went.

1295
01:18:38,544 --> 01:18:40,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to the idiot at Quiznos.

1296
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:44,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted my sandwich.

1297
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:55,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I specifically wanted a Philly cheesesteak sandwich on whole wheat bread with no mayonnaise and no sauce on it.

1298
01:18:56,037 --> 01:18:58,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Just meat and cheese and onions on wheat.

1299
01:18:59,446 --> 01:19:01,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't want it burned either, I want it toasted.

1300
01:19:02,628 --> 01:19:08,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guy's like, I'm like, okay, I want two goats.

1301
01:19:08,551 --> 01:19:10,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you being served by Ozzy Osbourne?

1302
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:11,793
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was being served by a moron.

1303
01:19:13,494 --> 01:19:16,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, okay, dude, I want a Philly cheesesteak.

1304
01:19:16,455 --> 01:19:17,616
[SPEAKER_02]: No mayonnaise.

1305
01:19:18,457 --> 01:19:20,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So he starts putting mayonnaise, and I'm like, dude, I said no mayonnaise.

1306
01:19:21,318 --> 01:19:22,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1307
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:24,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he puts it in.

1308
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get it, and he's like, okay, prime ribs.

1309
01:19:26,681 --> 01:19:28,142
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I said Philly cheesesteak.

1310
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, I'll go add cheese.

1311
01:19:31,423 --> 01:19:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1312
01:19:32,904 --> 01:19:37,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he rings it up as... I was like, dude, okay, first of all, you bring me up as a prime rib.

1313
01:19:37,869 --> 01:19:39,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different price.

1314
01:19:39,751 --> 01:19:42,013
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, oh, well, this is cheaper, so I'll just charge you for that.

1315
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:43,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fine, whatever.

1316
01:19:43,174 --> 01:19:45,937
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, I just ended up saying, where's your manager?

1317
01:19:46,217 --> 01:19:47,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the manager's only here in the morning.

1318
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's Quiznos number 1129 on...

1319
01:19:53,959 --> 01:19:55,760
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that road that's off of Zinfandel?

1320
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:56,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1321
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Not White Rock.

1322
01:19:57,601 --> 01:19:59,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call it off of Zinfandel.

1323
01:19:59,522 --> 01:20:00,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Zinfandel and 50.

1324
01:20:00,222 --> 01:20:03,784
[SPEAKER_02]: It's off of Zinfandel near 50, yeah.

1325
01:20:04,044 --> 01:20:06,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Across the street from Target and Cheezer's Pizza.

1326
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:07,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Olsen, it's Olsen Drive.

1327
01:20:07,946 --> 01:20:09,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Olsen, I used to work on that road.

1328
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:12,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's on Olsen in Rancho Cambodia.

1329
01:20:15,449 --> 01:20:19,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy's name was, I can't pronounce it, but it's A-K-O-B.

1330
01:20:21,534 --> 01:20:24,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever let this guy make you a sandwich because he'll burn it!

1331
01:20:25,699 --> 01:20:27,542
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw my sandwich, Rob!

1332
01:20:27,582 --> 01:20:28,243
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty burnt.

1333
01:20:31,025 --> 01:20:35,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I just came back from Philadelphia and you can't get cheesesteaks anywhere else like you can there.

1334
01:20:36,028 --> 01:20:37,729
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason they are Philly cheesesteaks.

1335
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:38,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this.

1336
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:39,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else is suck.

1337
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:42,513
[SPEAKER_02]: But dude, I have never had such idiotic service anywhere.

1338
01:20:42,873 --> 01:20:46,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I can understand, you know, missing it once.

1339
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:49,437
[SPEAKER_02]: But the dude wasn't even freaking listening to me anytime I said something.

1340
01:20:49,497 --> 01:20:51,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I want a small drink.

1341
01:20:51,059 --> 01:20:52,540
[SPEAKER_02]: He gives me a fucking large cup.

1342
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dude, small.

1343
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:55,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, maybe he was high.

1344
01:20:56,622 --> 01:20:57,163
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he was.

1345
01:20:57,763 --> 01:20:58,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell him somebody's high.

1346
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:00,485
[SPEAKER_02]: He was not red-eyed.

1347
01:21:01,265 --> 01:21:07,126
[SPEAKER_02]: He was not stealing the cheese out of the thing.

1348
01:21:07,226 --> 01:21:10,567
[SPEAKER_02]: He just was speaking in a whisper and not listening.

1349
01:21:10,607 --> 01:21:17,108
[SPEAKER_02]: He was looking off into space and like, dude, I don't care how much you hate your job, you can at least do it right, you know?

1350
01:21:17,868 --> 01:21:18,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever.

1351
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:24,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, thank you, DarkSakura, for your very specific and directed angst tonight.

1352
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:26,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your FUs of the week.

1353
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:28,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

1354
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:33,561
[SPEAKER_03]: FD of the Week goes to Christopher's desk for being rotted.

1355
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:35,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really foul.

1356
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:40,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I had to put a cup over the giant pile of rot.

1357
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally, there's, like, stuff growing.

1358
01:21:45,926 --> 01:21:47,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm creating a wall with cans.

1359
01:21:48,667 --> 01:21:51,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have enough yet, so I have to drink a couple more cans.

1360
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:52,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

1361
01:21:53,129 --> 01:21:54,030
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1362
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:57,311
[SPEAKER_04]: My FD of the Week goes to myself.

1363
01:21:58,161 --> 01:22:06,605
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Target that's across the street from said Quiznos because I was there and I was buying some diet soda.

1364
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:09,726
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the IBC root beer I'm consuming right now that's mixed with Malibu.

1365
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:20,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I was buying that and as I was pulling it off the shelf, it got caught on the cream soda next to it and so all the IBC cream soda went all over the floor and there was breaking glass everywhere.

1366
01:22:20,171 --> 01:22:23,472
[SPEAKER_04]: It made a beautiful noise, but F you to myself for being such a klutz.

1367
01:22:23,713 --> 01:22:25,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Old you fucking cream soda sucks, see?

1368
01:22:26,014 --> 01:22:26,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you know.

1369
01:22:27,659 --> 01:22:30,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh, explicit, any FUs tonight?

1370
01:22:32,002 --> 01:22:38,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, um, an FU to having a flat tire during the road while I was trying to go to my cousin's graduation.

1371
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:39,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought a lot of stuff.

1372
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:45,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I came into the party rather than not being able to make it.

1373
01:22:46,772 --> 01:22:51,635
[SPEAKER_01]: FU goes to pretty much everybody keeps overrating the over 9,000 joke.

1374
01:22:52,776 --> 01:22:54,777
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the over 9,000 joke, dare I ask?

1375
01:22:55,368 --> 01:23:01,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, if you go to YouTube, just type in over 9000 up at Google.com.

1376
01:23:01,591 --> 01:23:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a Dragon Ball Z thing?

1377
01:23:02,912 --> 01:23:03,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1378
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:04,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I have seen it.

1379
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:08,975
[SPEAKER_04]: His power level is over 9000!

1380
01:23:09,255 --> 01:23:14,697
[SPEAKER_04]: DMN linked me to something or sent us a song or something and I wanted to poke him in the eye with a fork.

1381
01:23:15,178 --> 01:23:16,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I know what you're talking about now.

1382
01:23:16,378 --> 01:23:17,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

1383
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:19,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear that almost every freaking day.

1384
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:30,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see, if it goes to my coworkers for trying to make me break New Year's resolution, I'm not sure if you guys will know that the New Year's resolution I gave up for the whole year.

1385
01:23:31,807 --> 01:23:32,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Dare I ask?

1386
01:23:32,627 --> 01:23:33,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Not erections again, is it?

1387
01:23:33,868 --> 01:23:34,388
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1388
01:23:34,448 --> 01:23:35,889
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave up sex or masturbating?

1389
01:23:36,089 --> 01:23:36,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Masturbation.

1390
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:38,711
[SPEAKER_04]: You gave up masturbating for a whole year?

1391
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:39,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1392
01:23:40,152 --> 01:23:41,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1393
01:23:41,232 --> 01:23:42,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you having sex with women at least?

1394
01:23:43,734 --> 01:23:44,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, sadly no.

1395
01:23:45,075 --> 01:23:47,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, you're gonna die.

1396
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:49,409
[SPEAKER_02]: You should just get a hooker.

1397
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:51,650
[SPEAKER_04]: For real.

1398
01:23:53,151 --> 01:23:55,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you're a brave man, that's all I have to say.

1399
01:23:57,534 --> 01:23:59,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, another F you goes to everybody.

1400
01:24:00,096 --> 01:24:02,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still talking about the 300 Sparta joke.

1401
01:24:04,099 --> 01:24:05,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Combined with a Chuck Norris.

1402
01:24:06,761 --> 01:24:09,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I got a shirt that says, This is Zelda!

1403
01:24:10,043 --> 01:24:11,204
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually funny.

1404
01:24:11,244 --> 01:24:11,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got that.

1405
01:24:11,864 --> 01:24:12,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good times.

1406
01:24:13,245 --> 01:24:15,807
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to some of the kids in Sadgun for asking me for money.

1407
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:21,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, if you... I don't know, I'm not sure how much money these kids spend on a con.

1408
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:31,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with their, like, $110 swords and their $50 Naruto jacket, etc., etc., etc.

1409
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, we're gonna be starting on that.

1410
01:24:35,749 --> 01:24:38,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, and... Well, that's all for now.

1411
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:44,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like how he always leaves it with, that's all for now, and then he'll be back, like, in a year.

1412
01:24:45,262 --> 01:24:49,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some FUs I've collected over the past year that I'd like to share with you.

1413
01:24:50,245 --> 01:24:51,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, actually, actually, I found something.

1414
01:24:52,406 --> 01:24:53,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I found something just for you.

1415
01:24:55,228 --> 01:24:56,489
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just for you, Jonas.

1416
01:25:11,324 --> 01:25:13,226
[SPEAKER_05]: for $9,000!

1417
01:25:13,746 --> 01:25:17,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it!

1418
01:25:22,874 --> 01:25:24,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that one of the most god-awful things you've ever heard?

1419
01:25:24,595 --> 01:25:25,676
[SPEAKER_04]: That was made by DMN.

1420
01:25:25,917 --> 01:25:27,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, gee, didn't see that coming.

1421
01:25:30,861 --> 01:25:32,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you the MP3 later, Jonas.

1422
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:34,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1423
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:35,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1424
01:25:36,181 --> 01:25:37,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get back to games, please?

1425
01:25:37,402 --> 01:25:47,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So something kind of cool came down to the Xbox Live video marketplace, and once I saw it, I thought, well, I don't know, I had to watch it, but I didn't.

1426
01:25:48,308 --> 01:25:52,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the Xbox Live marketplace, among other things, got a whole bunch of anime.

1427
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:59,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty awesome, including Guyver, Trinity Blood, Gunslinger Girl, Speedgrapher, Basilick,

1428
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:13,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Sayuki, Kitty Grade, The Count of Monte Cristo, Desert Punk, Last Exile, Rumbling Hearts, Galaxy Railways, Gilgamesh, and Lupin the Third Part 2.

1429
01:26:13,916 --> 01:26:19,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also got Akira, and Akira in HD, which is fucking awesome.

1430
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:25,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely worth checking out, especially if you're an anime fan, because that's one of the best anime movies I think of all time.

1431
01:26:26,468 --> 01:26:30,450
[SPEAKER_03]: and I believe Lady Death was also on there in HD so that's something else.

1432
01:26:32,030 --> 01:26:34,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Then beyond all that National Geographic shit.

1433
01:26:34,891 --> 01:26:38,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got National Geographic Adventure and yeah.

1434
01:26:39,993 --> 01:26:42,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So watch some Akira in HD.

1435
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:44,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I tell you a secret?

1436
01:26:44,998 --> 01:26:49,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people assume that because I do this show, I watch a ton of anime, which is so not true.

1437
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never seen Akira.

1438
01:26:51,001 --> 01:26:51,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1439
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:52,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't.

1440
01:26:53,122 --> 01:26:53,962
[SPEAKER_02]: The manga's better.

1441
01:26:54,022 --> 01:26:54,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't watch the anime.

1442
01:26:55,163 --> 01:26:55,883
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

1443
01:26:56,223 --> 01:26:58,304
[SPEAKER_03]: The anime is fucking awesome, and you know why?

1444
01:26:58,344 --> 01:26:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

1445
01:26:59,525 --> 01:27:00,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I started a fight.

1446
01:27:00,985 --> 01:27:05,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember going to this place called Steamers or whatever.

1447
01:27:05,507 --> 01:27:10,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a coffee shop slash video rental place.

1448
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:11,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like one of the...

1449
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,241
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fucking awesome movie.

[SPEAKER_03]: One of the main characters.

1452

1453
01:28:27,774 --> 01:28:31,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Has this show really lasted five years, somehow?

1454
01:28:31,457 --> 01:28:32,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet!

1455
01:28:33,338 --> 01:28:36,120
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, it could all end tonight, boys and girls.

1456
01:28:36,321 --> 01:28:36,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Crash!

1457
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:37,742
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting close.

1458
01:28:38,562 --> 01:28:40,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can we talk about something else, Rob?

1459
01:28:40,584 --> 01:28:40,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1460
01:28:41,044 --> 01:28:41,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the manga.

1461
01:28:43,726 --> 01:28:44,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut the fuck up and read a story.

1462
01:28:45,207 --> 01:28:46,228
Okay.

1463
01:28:47,049 --> 01:28:47,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guess what?

1464
01:28:47,749 --> 01:28:52,273
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that Castlevania film that was supposed to be done by Paul W.S.

1465
01:28:52,373 --> 01:28:52,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Anderson?

1466
01:28:53,654 --> 01:28:54,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he said, fuck y'all.

1467
01:28:56,156 --> 01:28:56,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

1468
01:28:56,929 --> 01:28:58,470
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I'm working on other projects.

1469
01:28:59,852 --> 01:29:01,693
[SPEAKER_02]: He's remaking Death Race.

1470
01:29:02,734 --> 01:29:03,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is awesome.

1471
01:29:03,615 --> 01:29:04,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more priority over Castlevania.

1472
01:29:05,217 --> 01:29:05,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

1473
01:29:05,797 --> 01:29:05,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1474
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the one that they are getting to replace him is Sylvain White, who brought us such classics as Stomp the Yard and I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer.

1475
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:23,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Such great American cinema classics.

1476
01:29:23,632 --> 01:29:39,341
[SPEAKER_02]: he is quoted saying most of the vampire films have been present or set in the future from Blade to Underworld and I was attracted to the chance to make a dark epic period movie that almost had an anime feel to it well there's Castlevania right the fuck there Van Helsing?

1477
01:29:40,481 --> 01:29:40,741
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody?

1478
01:29:40,781 --> 01:29:50,787
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah but that wasn't a good movie it just had Hugh Jackman being sexy and that's it but it had vampires and it was a period piece but it was a bad movie what about Bram Stoker's Dracula?

1479
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:52,888
[SPEAKER_02]: that was sexy oh my god

1480
01:29:53,607 --> 01:29:53,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

1481
01:29:54,467 --> 01:29:56,088
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Interview with a Vampire?

1482
01:29:56,108 --> 01:29:58,970
[SPEAKER_04]: That movie was so hot, I would make love to it if I could.

1483
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:05,413
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was sort of multiple... It was part period, part present, part... Part just, like, gay.

1484
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a gay movie.

1485
01:30:07,294 --> 01:30:09,555
[SPEAKER_02]: I disrespected making out all over the place.

1486
01:30:09,595 --> 01:30:10,115
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

1487
01:30:10,696 --> 01:30:11,396
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a good movie.

1488
01:30:11,456 --> 01:30:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: He probably just doesn't watch a lot of those classic films, you know, because he's in a whole other, you know, decade now, so... Who watches any of that stuff?

1489
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:21,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

1490
01:30:22,977 --> 01:30:33,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that maybe he might have some... I mean, if he gets the imagery off, then that'll be good.

1491
01:30:33,666 --> 01:30:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what's also interesting that he's going to be directing is Ronan, Frank Miller.

1492
01:30:41,152 --> 01:30:43,194
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it's not Paul W.S.

1493
01:30:43,334 --> 01:30:44,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Anderson or Revol.

1494
01:30:45,716 --> 01:30:48,098
[SPEAKER_03]: We need someone else to make fun of for making crappy movies.

1495
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:50,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has to start off somewhere, right?

1496
01:30:51,713 --> 01:30:54,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he did do I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer.

1497
01:30:55,254 --> 01:30:58,015
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a springboard, I'll say.

1498
01:30:58,115 --> 01:31:01,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to have some faith because you know me and my Castlevania.

1499
01:31:01,596 --> 01:31:02,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

1500
01:31:02,276 --> 01:31:04,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I will withhold judgment until the film is done.

1501
01:31:04,157 --> 01:31:05,277
[SPEAKER_04]: That's only fair, right?

1502
01:31:05,638 --> 01:31:06,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Halo.

1503
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:07,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody deserves a chance.

1504
01:31:07,358 --> 01:31:07,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Halo.

1505
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:09,519
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1506
01:31:09,859 --> 01:31:10,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Halo.

1507
01:31:10,592 --> 01:31:10,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo.

1508
01:31:11,172 --> 01:31:13,874
[SPEAKER_02]: You said yourself that you passed judgment on Halo.

1509
01:31:13,934 --> 01:31:15,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you learned your lesson, Bob?

1510
01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:17,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I so got pwned just now.

1511
01:31:17,517 --> 01:31:18,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you learned your lesson?

1512
01:31:18,597 --> 01:31:20,239
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'll never learn my lesson.

1513
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:21,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Haven't you learned that after five years?

1514
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:23,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I'm not going to tell.

1515
01:31:23,981 --> 01:31:25,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll always know where Jigglypuff is hiding.

1516
01:31:29,574 --> 01:31:49,240
