00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:24,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 3rd, 2007, rumors surface about Mario Kart Wii, Blizzard strikes against Gold Farmer's WoW, and a famous 80's movie is about to be made into a PC game.

2
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:43,792
[SPEAKER_06]: You should know by now that we're that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:49,999
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be here with you for the next few hours in two parts of a show to talk about the latest and what's going on in the gaming world.

5
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,281
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:51,792 --> 00:00:55,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello also to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:55,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Beer!

8
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:57,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Beer!

9
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:58,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what's tasty.

10
00:00:58,815 --> 00:01:00,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my weekend was beer.

11
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:04,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I don't really care for much beer except for Guinness, which isn't a beer, it's a stout.

12
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,258
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you need to have Newcastle.

13
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:07,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had Newcastle.

14
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:08,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Newcastle.

15
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:09,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Newcastle is permissible.

16
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got my husband to like a beer.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,541
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

18
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: He likes Killian's Red.

19
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:18,223
[SPEAKER_06]: See, if I'm going to drink, I'm going to drink something that's actually going to get me drunk.

20
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:19,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, beer doesn't work.

21
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:20,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on what you drink.

22
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Shimei Shimei Shimei Shimei

23
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:51,112
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

24
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:20,619
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

25
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:50,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Boobies!

26
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Boobies!

27
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games are really expensive.

28
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

29
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,611
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't talk about that enough on this show, but they are freaking expensive.

30
00:03:21,651 --> 00:03:23,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have my Pokemans.

31
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been going to the gym.

32
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:28,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm back to going to the gym now that my doctor's giving me the okay.

33
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:31,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get on the recumbent bike and play with my Pokemans.

34
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:32,713
[SPEAKER_06]: What's a recumbent bike?

35
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,213
[SPEAKER_03]: The recumbent bike is where you sit down like you're in a chair.

36
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:37,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds dirty.

37
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:40,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know a standard stationary bike has you upright.

38
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Recumbent means leaning back.

39
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:43,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

40
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go on the recumbent bike.

41
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:48,616
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like one of those boats that you pedal by.

42
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:49,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

43
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Or those lame-ass bikes that you see people pedaling.

44
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:54,281
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sitting back, and it looks stupid.

45
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, on the streets and stuff.

46
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:57,883
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually works out your legs, though, a different way.

47
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:58,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not always much.

48
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:04,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have to work back into my whole routine, I'm doing the recumbent bike so I can sit down and play with my Pokemans.

49
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you cannot play Pokemans on the elliptical.

50
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be kind of tough.

51
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:10,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't even freaking read on the elliptical.

52
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:12,894
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I've got to move my arms, too.

53
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:13,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

54
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:14,942
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

55
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:44,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey!

56
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:47,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

57
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:48,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Have I pinged out of chat?

58
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:50,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat room hasn't moved for me in a few minutes.

59
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:51,577
[SPEAKER_06]: That's concerning.

60
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:54,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll check on that while Loki talks about his gaming week.

61
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, did it involve going to the gym?

62
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:02,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember if I did go to the gym this week or not.

63
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I did one day.

64
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:04,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

65
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:04,899
[SPEAKER_07]: One day.

66
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like to, so I don't do it.

67
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

68
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:14,454
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this week I played a lot of weird stuff, other than the usual stuff.

69
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:20,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I played more Super Paper Mario, and to be honest, it's getting very repetitive towards the end of the game.

70
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost like they've ran out of ideas what to do.

71
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:30,888
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, well, let's just throw a hundred of these towards you, and how about let's make you replay levels again, and oh, that's fun.

72
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:38,794
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'll be very glad to see this game over, and I'll be very glad to return it for some store credit.

73
00:05:39,264 --> 00:05:41,185
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's not worth playing again.

74
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Even with all the side crap, not worth it.

75
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:46,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

76
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:49,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I played my PlayStation 3.

77
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:58,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, dusted that thing off, and then did a nice old firmware update, and then created myself a Japanese account to download Folklore.

78
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played it, and it's pretty fun.

79
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, since it's in Japanese, I have no idea what the storyline is.

80
00:06:05,903 --> 00:06:06,863
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this game all about?

81
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:07,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I know nothing about it.

82
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:15,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, um, I'm not really sure, like I said, because it's all in Japanese, but, um, there's two different characters you get to play as.

83
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:31,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I played through as the guy in the game, and you actually, what you're doing is kind of stealing the souls of these, like, critters that you kill, like, different, uh, enemies, almost like in Final Fantasy, and you gain abilities that they have, and you use those as your attacks throughout the game.

84
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:35,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So, once you've gotten some abilities and stuff, um,

85
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:36,626
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

86
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's something that I'm just not getting in the translation of the game.

87
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:08,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of all this shaking and body parts and stuff, what do you know about the Mortal Kombat Armageddon on the Wii?

88
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:09,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm really tempted to get it.

89
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,102
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks awesome, and apparently it's pretty easy to play because of the controls.

90
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:13,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

91
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:14,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

92
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:14,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

93
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tempted to play.

94
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:20,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus it has motor combat, and you can use, you know, your... That's true.

95
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:28,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Your... I guess it's supposed to be sort of controlled almost like... Not necessarily... I guess like Excite Trek a little bit.

96
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:28,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

97
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the one on PlayStation 2, and it was decent.

98
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:37,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there was a lot of stuff they crammed into one, you know, considering it was on the, I guess you should say, current-gen consoles or whatever.

99
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,360
[SPEAKER_06]: They really crammed a lot into it.

100
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'm interested in checking out the one on the Wii.

101
00:07:43,184 --> 00:07:43,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear it's pretty cool, though.

102
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:47,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, just from some of the descriptions, and they had, like, a little gameplay video there, too.

103
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Showing, you know, how you would play the game and stuff.

104
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,569
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked very simple.

105
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, even I would be able to pick it up.

106
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:56,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was looking at that list of fatalities that went out to the internet this week.

107
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And for some reason, we get Midway press releases all the time.

108
00:07:59,972 --> 00:08:01,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is pretty much the same things you end up seeing.

109
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:04,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Because game blogs just copy-paste what they're sending out in the press release, right?

110
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get those same things, but we never get free games for Midway.

111
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:08,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever.

112
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:09,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Cry.

113
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:10,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

114
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:11,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, lucky you.

115
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:12,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah.

116
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:14,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

117
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:17,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I got, let's see what, Spy Hunter?

118
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:18,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!

119
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:19,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Rampage?

120
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:20,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

121
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:21,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I take that back.

122
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:29,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I did get free games from Midway once, because there was this very sweet gal that worked there that I met at some trade show, and she hooked me up with the Classic Game Archives, which I really like.

123
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:41,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Midway put out some of my favorite stuff in the 80s, so the only thing that I complain about, about those Classic compilations, is that I have yet to see Journey the Arcade Game show up in one of them.

124
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it ran on the same hardware as Timber and all that other stuff, okay?

125
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:47,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you've got the licensing rights and stuff.

126
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:48,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

127
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:49,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

128
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:52,716
[SPEAKER_06]: If they can get Tron on Xbox Live, I can get Journey on Xbox Live.

129
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:54,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stop believing.

130
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I will hold on to that feeling.

131
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:57,859
[SPEAKER_03]: You do that, sir.

132
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,542
[SPEAKER_07]: So then I also played, well, I've downloaded a bunch of Japanese demos.

133
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:08,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I've downloaded the Hot Shots Golf 5 demo, so I haven't played that, or I guess Mineno Golf 5.

134
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:20,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I also downloaded some weird, I don't even know what the fuck it is, it's like their mascot in Japan, like some cat thing that you have, you basically raise it and it reads you Japanese news or something.

135
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:24,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the cat, the white cat with the big face?

136
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:25,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

137
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:26,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're talking about, yeah.

138
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:34,663
[SPEAKER_07]: The only problem is, in order to play that game, I had to download some update or something, and it took like an hour to download, so I got very bored with that real quick.

139
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:37,385
[SPEAKER_03]: That cat was actually based off of old text emoticons.

140
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:37,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

141
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:38,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

142
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:39,224
[SPEAKER_07]: B-Boy Breakdancing

143
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:01,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Not exactly like Bust a Move or anything like that, but it's pretty cool.

144
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:06,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes a lot to get used to the game, though, because there's a lot of transitioning and stuff.

145
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:08,686
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of rhythm stuff in there as well.

146
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:09,827
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's pretty fun.

147
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:11,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got that.

148
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what else have I been trying to play?

149
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the full version of LocoRoco.

150
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:18,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't touched that yet.

151
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,898
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also Puzzle Quest.

152
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:21,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got that on...

153
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:26,525
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP, and then I got Nelly, the DS one, so she's been playing that a little bit.

154
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,387
[SPEAKER_07]: But she doesn't really get the game, but she's been playing it.

155
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, Earth Defense Force 2017.

156
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to finish that game up.

157
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:35,733
[SPEAKER_07]: We're almost done.

158
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:37,074
[SPEAKER_07]: We almost got all the weapons on it.

159
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:39,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Just trying to finish some of these harder levels.

160
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:43,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And, let's see.

161
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:48,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, I think I haven't really been playing too much else on...

162
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,510
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

163
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:21,130
[SPEAKER_07]: or videos, I believe.

164
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to put the file in there.

165
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:31,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't know that, and so I've been kind of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to get this thing to work, because I'm like, well, I converted it, right?

166
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:32,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it not fucking seeing it?

167
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So finally, I figured out that's what I need to do.

168
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:37,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Works like a charm now.

169
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,278
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's pretty awesome.

170
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:40,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

171
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So lots of hacking and stuff in your wake, it sounds like.

172
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots, yes.

173
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is only going to be a gateway to putting porn on the PS3 now, so...

174
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,953
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm glad you... At least you have a goal in mind.

175
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:52,854
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good to have goals.

176
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:54,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta have goals.

177
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:59,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at the chat room for some feedback here, SSJ100Matt says, That's not a surprise, Loki.

178
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same with the PSP.

179
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:08,868
[SPEAKER_07]: But see, that's the thing with the PSP is I put it in the video folder for the PSP because the PSP is even worse than the PS3 as far as how strict, you know, the...

180
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,535
[SPEAKER_07]: What folders and the file names and stuff like that.

181
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:14,437
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought, okay, well I'll just throw it in there and see if that works.

182
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:16,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, that didn't work either.

183
00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So I actually had to use, it was funny, my camcorder that I have because the batteries don't work in it anymore.

184
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:25,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just plugged that in and now it's a 20 gig jump drive.

185
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:30,813
[SPEAKER_06]: The Rob D in chat says the PS3 is a gateway for porn.

186
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:35,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, the PS3 is fucking easy to download demos to the Japanese accounts.

187
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:36,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so easy to create one.

188
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:38,619
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no restrictions whatsoever.

189
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can download all your games just like the Xbox 360.

190
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you download on Japanese accounts is playable on all accounts.

191
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:46,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

192
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:47,107
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easy.

193
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:48,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, good tip.

194
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,650
[SPEAKER_06]: My gaming week was pretty short.

195
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,771
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a lot to it.

196
00:12:52,336 --> 00:13:20,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing a lot more World of Warcraft I hit level 55 I've been grinding a lot this week trying to get to Outlands I want to get to 58 very bad because a lot of the guild which by the way our guild like blew up in the past couple weeks we have tons more people on the guild now I played I know I saw you on the other night yeah I forgot to say that I played yeah for like half a second though because then Shane kicked me off my computer because he wanted to get on and kick people out of the guild or whatever his because Shane is actually the guild leader so he I didn't get kicked tyrant and he booted like three people one night but as a joke I mean it was it was funny yeah

197
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:29,589
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been working on that because a lot of the guild is in Shane and some of them are in Outlands now and they won't shut up about how awesome the Outlands are and how they're never going back to the old world.

198
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:32,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm working on it, trying to get there.

199
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:33,813
[SPEAKER_06]: You went to Outworld?

200
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Mortal Kombat or Outlands?

201
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:40,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I got my Mortal Kombat mixed up with my... No, you said Outlands.

202
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:40,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I?

203
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:41,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I said Outworlds.

204
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,401
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't surprise me if I screwed something up.

205
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:45,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually do.

206
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:50,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But then besides World of Warcraft, I've been spending a whole lot of gaming time

207
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:50,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Actraiser

208
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,860
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

209
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,197
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

210
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:11,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Check the forums for more details or the live journal.

211
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:17,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to the live listeners because I know the live listeners kind of got screwed last week because we did our thing live at Faname.

212
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, we won't have a show next week, but we will be back on June 17th.

213
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:23,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be a fun show.

214
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:28,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And then June 24th is the 5th anniversary show of Orange Lounge Radio, the official 5th anniversary.

215
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:38,527
[SPEAKER_06]: But I should mention that the live station, which went up a little bit earlier than we actually did a live show, because remember, our station was up for a little while to promote that we were going to be doing a live show back in 2002.

216
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:44,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Our live station turned 5 years old this week on May 30th, so happy birthday to the live station.

217
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,274
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll be officially celebrating on the 24th.

218
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:47,854
[SPEAKER_06]: How?

219
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:48,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

220
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:50,594
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

221
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,309
[SPEAKER_06]: and, of course, everybody in chat's kind of crying.

222
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:23,210
[SPEAKER_06]: ChainsawJuggling says, boo.

223
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:26,892
[SPEAKER_06]: ShadowCharlie says, since I'm traveling also, I won't have to worry about it.

224
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:27,912
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

225
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys, but surely you understand.

226
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:32,055
[SPEAKER_06]: We need vacations, too.

227
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:35,316
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so let's get into some gaming news.

228
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:37,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

229
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:42,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and there's some interesting news, not surprising at all.

230
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,902
[SPEAKER_07]: But, according to the website, JudeFrance.com,

231
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:57,258
[SPEAKER_07]: They have run into a credible rumor, they say, that says that Nintendo is going to drop the bomb at EA, or not EA, E3, Mini E3, I guess.

232
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,501
[SPEAKER_07]: That they're going to be announcing a brand new Mario Kart game for the Wii.

233
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:05,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on, it's only a matter of time before a Mario Kart game comes out for the Wii.

234
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:08,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it's not a part of the arcade game, but who knows.

235
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:13,629
[SPEAKER_07]: The other rumor is that there's going to be some new hardware news as well.

236
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:26,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether this be a revision to the current Wii hardware, something altogether new, or possibly, you know, I'm thinking maybe it's a DVD playback, something like that, but no idea.

237
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:34,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously there's going to be some announcements at E3, but Mario Kart, if that happens, I'm not too surprised.

238
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:40,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides, this is why I buy every damn system that Nintendo puts out for Mario Kart.

239
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:45,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it seems like a foregone conclusion to me.

240
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously this game is coming out on the Wii at some point, right?

241
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:49,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

242
00:17:49,642 --> 00:17:50,683
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of time.

243
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:55,247
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like saying a Mario game is coming out on a Nintendo system.

244
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:56,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'd be, uh, okay?

245
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:57,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

246
00:17:58,269 --> 00:17:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course there's a Mario game coming out.

247
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you guys heard it here first.

248
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:04,974
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a new Zelda game coming out on the Wii at some point.

249
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:08,337
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know much more about it, but there will be another Zelda game on the Wii.

250
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:10,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody beat us to that, I think.

251
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:10,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Goddammit.

252
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you heard it here first.

253
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:17,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV will be coming out to some console at some point.

254
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:20,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely definitive news.

255
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be funny if that was a PC game?

256
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that wouldn't be a console.

257
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop trying to screw our exclusive news, you bastard.

258
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

259
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:37,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the... You know what's funny about... I was trying to figure out if that was the same site that a long time ago...

260
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like in 2005.

261
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:45,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I got an email from some French website about E3.

262
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,667
[SPEAKER_06]: But they actually didn't mean to send it to me.

263
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:50,609
[SPEAKER_06]: They meant to send it to some staffer that had a very similar name to me.

264
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was a missent email to my Gmail box.

265
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the weirdest thing ever.

266
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,773
[SPEAKER_06]: But I ended up writing the guy back and he spoke English luckily.

267
00:18:56,853 --> 00:18:59,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ended up giving this site pictures from E3.

268
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:00,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it was the same site.

269
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:02,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was like a French Nintendo only site.

270
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they only used the pictures from the Nintendo booth that I took that year.

271
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so interesting.

272
00:19:07,101 --> 00:19:07,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

273
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:08,376
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

274
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:45,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Also talking about Nintendo and Virtual Console, obviously I was very happy that ActRaiser was like the 99th Virtual Console title to be released, but that means that this Monday, the 100th Virtual Console title will be released, and they've already announced it's going to be Zelda II, The Adventure of Link.

275
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:46,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

276
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:50,130
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is coming out on, I believe, what, June 4th?

277
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I one of the only people that doesn't like that game?

278
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:53,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

279
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:53,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

280
00:19:56,032 --> 00:20:02,702
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're not, because I've been reading game blogs, and a lot of people have been kind of saying, like, oh, it's one of the weaker Zelda games in the franchise.

281
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:03,643
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was a CDI.

282
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:05,961
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just different.

283
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:10,423
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you think about it, weren't all the sequels on Nintendo really different?

284
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:11,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

285
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:13,344
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, very different from 1, yes?

286
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:14,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Mario Bros.

287
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,305
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 was not Super Mario Bros.

288
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it was the whole... There was a Super Mario 2 in Japan.

289
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:19,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Doki Doki Panic or whatever.

290
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,767
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just like the first one.

291
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:23,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say all that international garbage.

292
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:25,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I said here in the U.S.

293
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:28,570
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Zelda game was released in Japan as a Zelda sequel.

294
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, how about this?

295
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Simon's Quest.

296
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely different from the first Castlevania.

297
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:33,012
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

298
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:34,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And completely better.

299
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:35,886
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

300
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to agree with that.

301
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:40,827
[SPEAKER_03]: It was better than the first, you know, Demon Castle Dracula.

302
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, whatever, Miss Prim and Proper.

303
00:20:43,228 --> 00:20:43,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

304
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Miss I-play-nothing-but-import-games-my-entire-life.

305
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not play nothing but import games.

306
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:48,569
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so there you go.

307
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:53,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob D says, Well, excuse me, DarkSakura.

308
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make that a sound file.

309
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:59,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to find that old clip from the old 80s Zelda.

310
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:01,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Just replace Princess with DarkSakura.

311
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Or leave it at Princess.

312
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:03,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be appropriate.

313
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:04,957
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

314
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:06,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay me my respect.

315
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:07,579
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

316
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo is putting out Zelda 2, The Adventure, Link, and blah, blah, blah.

317
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,982
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bragging that the internet connection rate is 40%.

318
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,223
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more happy, though, for our friends in the UK.

319
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:27,030
[SPEAKER_03]: For the European Virtual Console, actually, I guess I should say Europe, but there are going to be some pretty fun stuff coming out over on the Virtual Console.

320
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,913
[SPEAKER_03]: You get Streets of Rage 2, which I love the Streets of Rage games.

321
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:32,954
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really fun.

322
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,940
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

323
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:09,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And then coming from the TurboGrafx-16, it looks like there's World of Sports Competition, which is, well, shit.

324
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:12,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about it.

325
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying that just because it's a sports game?

326
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:18,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's some pretty awesome old school sports games I'm waiting for.

327
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:19,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not like World of Sports Competition.

328
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:21,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It ranked right there below Keith Courage.

329
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:27,741
[SPEAKER_06]: However, now that I have ActRacer, you know, and now what virtual console game will I complain about?

330
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:29,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, obviously there's The Guardian Legend.

331
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:32,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember when Zelda 2 came out on the European Virtual Console in January?

332
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:54,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they got it a long time ago.

333
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:55,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So did Japan.

334
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,674
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been having to wait this whole time.

335
00:22:57,814 --> 00:23:01,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says Zelda 2 was underrated and by far was one of the better titles.

336
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:01,896
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't.

337
00:23:02,616 --> 00:23:03,137
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't.

338
00:23:03,357 --> 00:23:03,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was!

339
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:05,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not one of the better titles.

340
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:09,440
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay, but it was like... I will say it was pretty good.

341
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,461
[SPEAKER_07]: His sword looked like a fucking dagger throughout the whole game.

342
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:13,142
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird.

343
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:13,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

344
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:16,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I have found some fun hacks for that game, though.

345
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the penis hack.

346
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:30,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember I got stuck on like the fifth part of the game where I couldn't figure out jumping down the, what was it, the chimney?

347
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:31,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

348
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:35,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you had to climb up on top of the house, but you had to get the double jump to do it.

349
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:37,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, yeah.

350
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:38,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

351
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:45,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually ended up, I don't know how, but I skipped random levels on that.

352
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably download it and he's

353
00:23:51,618 --> 00:23:52,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I said penis, shut up!

354
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Preferably Super Mario RPG.

355
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:08,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you never know if Squeenix put Actraiser on there finally.

356
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,831
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always a chance.

357
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:10,731
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a chance.

358
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:13,713
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the regular Mario Kart, not Mario Kart 64?

359
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:15,674
[SPEAKER_07]: That needs to come on there.

360
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:21,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if it's true there's a Mario Kart Wii in the future, I would think they would time that around the release of Mario Kart Wii, right?

361
00:24:21,178 --> 00:24:24,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess I gotta wait until August too for all the Metroid games.

362
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,042
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68, by the way, stop doing the freaking color over your text.

363
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:29,663
[SPEAKER_03]: But you do make a good point.

364
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:32,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have the best ending thing when you died.

365
00:24:32,986 --> 00:24:34,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Game over, return of Ganon.

366
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:35,748
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

367
00:24:35,788 --> 00:24:38,851
[SPEAKER_06]: When you died, it would say, game over, return of Ganon.

368
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:40,072
[SPEAKER_06]: He's killed everybody.

369
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:41,593
[SPEAKER_06]: He's murdered the children.

370
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:42,674
[SPEAKER_06]: He's raped the babies.

371
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:44,275
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's all because of you.

372
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And next time you do the colored text like that, I'm going to kick you.

373
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:53,071
[SPEAKER_06]: WonderDogHerald wants to know when the heck Zombie 8 My Neighbors is coming to the virtual concert.

374
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, that was the best game ever.

375
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:56,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Hostile1 wants RC Pro-Am.

376
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,754
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good choice, but that's a rare game, right?

377
00:24:58,794 --> 00:24:59,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Fester's Quest.

378
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:04,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the most random title to me.

379
00:25:04,257 --> 00:25:04,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it was good.

380
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:05,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master.

381
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:06,359
[SPEAKER_06]: No it wasn't.

382
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,380
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Blaster Master.

383
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck Blades of Steel.

384
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:11,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Blaster Master.

385
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:12,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

386
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Scratch my earlier comment.

387
00:25:16,044 --> 00:25:17,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Blades of Steel can fucking wait.

388
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:17,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Blaster Master.

389
00:25:17,885 --> 00:25:19,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.

390
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:22,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaster Master has to have the grenade trick.

391
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:23,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time.

392
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:24,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

393
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:28,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the way you pause it and over and over on the big jellyfish guy and some of the other bosses.

394
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:31,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And it explodes him faster.

395
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:36,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here's the thing, though, is that, like, every time the virtual console comes up, we keep bitching and whining about the games we want to see.

396
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's move on, shall we?

397
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:47,260
[SPEAKER_07]: They also need to change the way I can find the games on the virtual console because this ghetto JavaScript shit is lame.

398
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Why'd you tell Firebomba to go to hell?

399
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:51,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I said Blade of Steel was better than Blaster Master.

400
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:51,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to hell.

401
00:25:52,247 --> 00:25:53,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go to hell.

402
00:25:53,627 --> 00:25:54,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to hell and burn there.

403
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:57,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And roast some marshmallows too.

404
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:05,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, ours has got to be one of the only video game podcasts out there that just totally tells their listeners to go to hell when we disagree with them.

405
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,450
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because we're friends.

406
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

407
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody else is telling them to go to hell too.

408
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:14,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, mom mentality.

409
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:19,528
[SPEAKER_07]: We also need to get Yonoid because I was like... Oh, you know what else was cool?

410
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:20,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Uniracers!

411
00:26:20,489 --> 00:26:21,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool spot.

412
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:22,490
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just get a whole bunch.

413
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just have one week where it's all like, you know, product placement.

414
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we talk about new games, please?

415
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,293
[SPEAKER_07]: No, let's talk about Ubisoft because they like to port over crappy games.

416
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:32,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to hell!

417
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:38,136
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ubisoft admits that they were overporting some of their GameCube games to the Wii.

418
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:41,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, you know, not necessarily GameCube games, but Xbox and you name it.

419
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with such wonderful...

420
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:55,423
[SPEAKER_07]: games as Far Cry Vengeance, which, two-player multiplayer deathmatch, that's uber lame, okay, uber lame.

421
00:26:56,404 --> 00:27:00,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Prince of Persia Rival Swords, which, you know, is just two thrones all over again.

422
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:04,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were going to say Rival Schools, and I'm like, that would be great.

423
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:14,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course, they may apologize now, but Driver Parallel Lines is coming out later on in June, so they're still not done that.

424
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course there's also the Monster 4x4 World Circuit, which is a crappy Xbox game.

425
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:25,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there was also that GT game, which was also a GameCube game that also sucked.

426
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:28,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Just stop porting over crappy games, seriously.

427
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:32,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Make some new stuff, and make it better than Red Steel.

428
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:39,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, was anyone really surprised by this news that Ubisoft kind of admitted, yeah, we just ported over some of our old shit.

429
00:27:40,296 --> 00:27:40,917
[SPEAKER_06]: We were in a hurry.

430
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:43,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Ubisoft, thank you for sucking.

431
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:47,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these games were bad for even GameCube games.

432
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,940
[SPEAKER_07]: They were crappy.

433
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,221
[SPEAKER_07]: But Wii Remote Control, Wii.

434
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:58,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked Far Cry, you know, on the Xbox 360.

435
00:27:58,963 --> 00:28:01,644
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Wii, it was a whole different game.

436
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:02,084
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just

437
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:04,526
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Gauss Panic.

438
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:38,511
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but there's one, and then, like, it flips over to, like, the real demon face with, like, the blood pouring down his face.

439
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:40,592
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, everybody, move your body.

440
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:43,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, like, this really horrible techno song.

441
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:44,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the game.

442
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:50,376
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my favorite game on that MAME emulator ever because it's so random.

443
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:54,498
[SPEAKER_06]: You have all these pictures of boobies, MAME, M-A-M-E, whatever, right?

444
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:56,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the E stands for emulator.

445
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:57,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

446
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm being redundant.

447
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,180
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like ordering a cheese quesadilla.

448
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Deal with it.

449
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, right?

450
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:06,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, but, oh, this is the best game ever.

451
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:12,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, please, if you have, ask your parents' permission, though, if you're under 18, because you do see titties in it.

452
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:13,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Or sneak.

453
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:16,554
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't say that.

454
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:19,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, yeah, the chat room's going to look for the link there, see?

455
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:21,218
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura DarkSakura DarkSakura

456
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: How about my foot, you know, kicking you in the head?

457
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:55,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully that gave Rob D something to work with.

458
00:29:55,268 --> 00:29:55,628
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

459
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:56,969
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way.

460
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:57,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

461
00:29:58,249 --> 00:29:58,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

462
00:29:59,490 --> 00:29:59,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

463
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do more stories?

464
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can.

465
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:06,392
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about, speaking of the Wii, because we're talking about the Wii, we'll talk about Mario Party 8.

466
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:08,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anyone played Mario Party 8 yet?

467
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:08,653
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

468
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:09,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

469
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:10,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard mixed reviews on it.

470
00:30:11,454 --> 00:30:15,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard some people say it was good, and some people, like reviewers, saying it sucked.

471
00:30:15,756 --> 00:30:17,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But the real people I talked to said it was good.

472
00:30:17,836 --> 00:30:19,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure what to believe.

473
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:22,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played it yet, but there it is.

474
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Party 8 is out on the street.

475
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,220
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reason why we're bringing this up, that's not newsworthy.

476
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,160
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already talked about that.

477
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:42,544
[SPEAKER_06]: What is newsworthy is that folks are trying to make backup copies, quote unquote, they're making backup copies of the game as they've made backup copies of other games, but their backup copies of Mario Party 8 aren't working.

478
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:45,244
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not working with the modded Wii units.

479
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So has it been possible that

480
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:50,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo has come up with a workaround for this?

481
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

482
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Or perhaps the Wii has realized that it's such a crappy game that it doesn't want to play it.

483
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,773
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I've become smarter thanks to modding.

484
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:00,094
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this shit that you're trying to insert into me?

485
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:01,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Be gone!

486
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:05,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, JVmon says, I have it, Sky.

487
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

488
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:09,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Gerardimo says, but really boring to play by yourself.

489
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, I mean, that's just Mario Party.

490
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,160
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a party game.

491
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,962
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, I don't know, Rayman's Raven Rabbids is kind of boring to play by yourself.

492
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:24,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Fireboma says, because it's Mario Party, it's the same game being rehashed over three different platforms and only remotely changes when it moves to another system.

493
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but the Wii, Wii Bo, Wii.

494
00:31:29,441 --> 00:31:30,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, we'll see.

495
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:34,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And BlackDevilerX asks, Sky, are you going to be Princess Peach?

496
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:37,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah, I always play Princess Peach in the games because Peach is the winner.

497
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:40,864
[SPEAKER_06]: She says so herself.

498
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:43,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then it must be true.

499
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:44,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, it must be true.

500
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:49,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some other games that are going to be coming out soon, besides Mario Party 8, which is already out.

501
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about upcoming games.

502
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:52,374
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start over in Europe.

503
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:54,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mom, the game, is coming out.

504
00:31:54,634 --> 00:31:55,234
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously.

505
00:31:56,835 --> 00:32:01,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Loki is coming out on PC on the 4th, which has already passed.

506
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:02,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

507
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:04,797
[SPEAKER_03]: No, wait, that's tomorrow, isn't it?

508
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:07,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's already passed by the time you guys get it.

509
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:09,638
[SPEAKER_07]: That's also Nelly's birthday, by the way.

510
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I was going to tell her happy birthday because my live journal told me.

511
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:26,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out though on the 8th is Brothers in Arms DS, Forza Motorsport 2, Halo 2 Vista Edition for PC, of course, because Vista, you know, gives people headaches.

512
00:32:26,893 --> 00:32:36,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Mercury Meltdown Revolution on Wii, Pac-Man Rally, Pangaea Golf with Style on Wii, Trion Cube, and Vortex Senko no Ronde.

513
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:40,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it coming out with the Japanese name in Europe?

514
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:52,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's actually, that's, no, Sega Narande was the name that it was in Japan, but they added that Wartek to the front of it because that makes people want it more because it's got the word war in it.

515
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:54,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, ooh, Wartek!

516
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:58,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in that case, it must be a war game or something.

517
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:02,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, maybe it's just that people like,

518
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:04,687
[SPEAKER_03]: to have something.

519
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it beats their last.

520
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:09,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what the name before it was because there was like Battlescape.

521
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:15,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Cinco Norondo was at one time a name possibility for it.

522
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:18,320
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it feel that you have a game named after you coming out?

523
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:20,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen screenshots of it.

524
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:22,424
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like fucking Ragnarok.

525
00:33:23,225 --> 00:33:23,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, goody.

526
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's

527
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:31,483
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely not about me because you wouldn't be able to contain such awesomeness in a game like that.

528
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:34,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand MMO, but, you know.

529
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:39,951
[SPEAKER_06]: However, SSJ100Matt says there is a code in the Loki game to unlock a Tingle costume.

530
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:41,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So, be on the lookout.

531
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:44,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That's reason enough to get it, I think.

532
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:47,198
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these days, Loki, you watch.

533
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:49,019
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to drug you and put you in the costume.

534
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever.

535
00:33:51,809 --> 00:34:00,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so this week we see the release in the United States for Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition on the PlayStation 2 and PC.

536
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:07,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on PC and coming to the 360, Call of Juarez, which is pretty awesome.

537
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:09,294
[SPEAKER_07]: First person shooter western game.

538
00:34:10,554 --> 00:34:12,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Hospital Tycoon for the PC.

539
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:15,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Ball Z Haru Kanaru.

540
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:17,616
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like a tongue twister right there.

541
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:19,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Haru Kanaru, I guess.

542
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,121
[SPEAKER_07]: and Densetsu DS.

543
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:26,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically just, you know, Dragon Ball Z RPG on the DS.

544
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:28,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it a fighting game?

545
00:34:28,344 --> 00:34:28,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't remember.

546
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:33,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, uh... Planet Puzzle League coming to the DS.

547
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:37,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, another, uh... What was that one game?

548
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:39,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, whatever.

549
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:41,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Another rip-off of another puzzle game.

550
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:47,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Puzzlescape coming to PSP and then, of course, the Sims 2 H&M stuff.

551
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:51,239
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be funny if it was S&M stuff.

552
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,760
[SPEAKER_06]: More Sims 2 stuff?

553
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

554
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:53,780
[SPEAKER_06]: More?

555
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,001
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this, their 11th expansion?

556
00:34:56,101 --> 00:34:56,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.

557
00:34:57,002 --> 00:34:57,282
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

558
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the H&M fashion stuff.

559
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:07,087
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, moving on to Japan and what's coming out over there.

560
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:16,072
[SPEAKER_06]: On June 7th, Harvest Moon for the Wii comes out because, you know, you just can't have a Nintendo system without a Harvest Moon game on it, so there you go.

561
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:22,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End, the Japanese version of that, coming out on June the 7th as well, also on the Wii.

562
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:29,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not much until the 14th, but that's when Ninja Gaiden Sigma comes out, so look for that.

563
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:37,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, The Magician's Academy, also Wizardry X2.

564
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,997
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wonder Price, I guess, is coming out there.

565
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:43,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe it's called Wonder Price because it's discounted.

566
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:45,139
[SPEAKER_06]: That would make a lot more sense, wouldn't it?

567
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out, because I first read it, I thought it said Wonder Prince, but I guess not.

568
00:35:50,168 --> 00:36:04,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, you have Kabu Trader Shun is coming out from Capcom, Kazujin Taisen coming out from Nintendo, and also another version of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End coming out on the Nintendo DS.

569
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:11,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Yoshi's Island pouches for your DS are coming out if you like Yoshi Island.

570
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:13,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a game, but...

571
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:15,449
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

572
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:36,329
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

573
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:05,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Take note, SNK!

574
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:10,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so that's going to do it for release dates.

575
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:20,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's actually some really cool news for people who are fans of Second Life, is that this upcoming

576
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:32,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think that it's already passed given the date of, yeah, it was on June 1st at 7pm, but BBC2 was broadcasting on Second Life.

577
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:41,725
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing The Money Program, which is a business show that shows how big business affects everyday life.

578
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:50,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently this looks like it might become a standard thing, I hope.

579
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Did somebody throw cocks at them?

580
00:37:53,681 --> 00:38:00,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for anyone in Second Life, the only place that you could go to watch it was the Red Run Red Cinema in Second Life.

581
00:38:01,686 --> 00:38:03,207
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's kind of cool.

582
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally have never played Second Life.

583
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:06,289
[SPEAKER_06]: This stuff is all foreign to me.

584
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:09,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried once and thought it was crap, so I stopped playing.

585
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:12,512
[SPEAKER_06]: All I ever can think about was Second Life with the flying penises.

586
00:38:12,572 --> 00:38:13,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that one YouTube video.

587
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:14,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I have real life.

588
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:17,195
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have a first life.

589
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:22,258
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be fun just to roam around Second Life and do stuff to annoy people.

590
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:29,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the cool thing is that someone actually built the inside of the TARDIS and built Daleks and all that.

591
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:30,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was cool.

592
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerds, all of you.

593
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:39,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I would want to make a giant stick man that's like, you know, 500 stories tall that stomps around and smashes everything.

594
00:38:39,836 --> 00:38:41,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, can we have monsters in Second Life?

595
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:42,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, can I make Godzilla?

596
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:48,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, people made, you know, weapons of mass destruction and have blown stuff up, so... That's lovely.

597
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:49,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not?

598
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:56,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Giant Mario, have him get the star thing, turn into the pixelated Mario, Smash, Smash, Smash.

599
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,869
[SPEAKER_07]: People would find humor in that, I would think.

600
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:01,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw a really funny picture speaking of Mario Smash.

601
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:10,577
[SPEAKER_06]: It was someone's signature on our forums, on the DarkSakura forums, because that's where our World of Warcraft guild has their forums headquartered.

602
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:12,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Wellplay.DarkSakura.com There you have it.

603
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:16,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody made this little graphic or found it somewhere of, you see...

604
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:18,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

605
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:18,695
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 Super Mario Bros. 3

606
00:39:45,956 --> 00:39:47,317
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

607
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:20,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Check out the Fury Beta sign-up page at www.unleashthefury.com and slash beta.

608
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:21,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can check out that.

609
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:23,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks pretty neat.

610
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,561
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some other game out there.

611
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:31,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember the name of it, but it was a Korean MMO that's kind of like, they compared it to The Matrix.

612
00:40:31,725 --> 00:40:36,108
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of, you know, jumping on walls, or running on walls in gunfights and stuff like that.

613
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:38,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But this looks kind of neat.

614
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:39,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the title.

615
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, you saw the picture?

616
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:46,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just watching it because Junami linked it.

617
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:47,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't even see it.

618
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:48,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Junami beat me to it.

619
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:48,934
[SPEAKER_06]: You bastard!

620
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:50,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, though.

621
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:51,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat room.

622
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:53,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, I'm looking it up.

623
00:40:53,797 --> 00:41:01,322
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got distracted by a post because somebody was spamming the forums again, advertising Viagra, and, you know, I was just really curious because... No, I'm kidding.

624
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:03,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody reads those posts on any forum.

625
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:04,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.

626
00:41:06,706 --> 00:41:08,867
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just now seeing the Loki tingle graphic?

627
00:41:09,788 --> 00:41:12,309
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our listeners did that, like, last week and put it on my All Games blog.

628
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry.

629
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:14,969
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not good radio.

630
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:15,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Fail.

631
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:35,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, and, uh, let's see.

632
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:40,176
[SPEAKER_06]: The sign-up started, it looks like, on May 31st, and I don't see a closed date.

633
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, this is going to be an MMO from Perpetual Entertainment, and you get to be the son or a daughter of an Olympus god.

634
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:56,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, uh, so you get to conquer enemies of Rome, you get to battle the iconic enemies such as the Cyclops, Minotaur, Hydra, so on, Medusa, etc., etc.

635
00:41:57,187 --> 00:41:58,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So, check that out.

636
00:41:58,187 --> 00:42:01,369
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're into MMOs and you like Greek mythology, it'd be a good time.

637
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And the, the

638
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:03,128
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

639
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:44,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's website of the week actually is brought to me by my amazing sauce, who is wonderful and full of internet nerdness and greatness.

640
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lolbots.com, and this basically takes Caturday and just macros every freaking nerdy thing ever in existence.

641
00:42:54,581 --> 00:42:58,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have you know that my wife looked at this and she didn't get it.

642
00:42:58,722 --> 00:43:00,623
[SPEAKER_07]: As did I. I didn't get it.

643
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:02,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I lol'd a couple times.

644
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:05,536
[SPEAKER_03]: You do not have the geek vibe in you, obviously.

645
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:05,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

646
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand why it's supposed to be funny.

647
00:43:08,818 --> 00:43:10,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't care anymore.

648
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:12,080
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, it's old.

649
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:13,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it up.

650
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:14,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, we get it.

651
00:43:15,002 --> 00:43:15,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

652
00:43:15,662 --> 00:43:21,286
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been games that have been translated, literally, you know, from their Japanese stuff, and it was funny because it was English.

653
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:22,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, funny!

654
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:23,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha!

655
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,728
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, get over it!

656
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,709
[SPEAKER_07]: That was years ago!

657
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:26,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on!

658
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,372
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, literacy is not a jokey matter.

659
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:36,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know where the hell we go after that.

660
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:38,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Prozac.

661
00:43:39,674 --> 00:43:40,955
[SPEAKER_03]: You should get some.

662
00:43:42,855 --> 00:43:43,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Valium, maybe.

663
00:43:44,336 --> 00:43:47,537
[SPEAKER_06]: LOLbots.com Valium.com for Loki.

664
00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:56,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you need to be reading some of those forum posts that advertise the, you know, antidepressants from the interwebs.

665
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:00,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, if you have trouble keeping it up, read the Viagra spam.

666
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:02,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

667
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:07,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing our weekly part in promoting GameTap.

668
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:10,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Swear to God we're not on their payroll, I swear.

669
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we are.

670
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:14,828
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not getting paid.

671
00:44:16,288 --> 00:44:17,788
[SPEAKER_07]: They fixed the glitch in accounting.

672
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:19,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways...

673
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,963
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of their normal subscription service, they're doing a free ad-supported service that's coming out.

674
00:44:27,983 --> 00:44:31,905
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be rotating 30 games every so often.

675
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:43,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting off, you're going to get to play for free Panzer Dragoon, Metal Slug 2, Art of Fighting, The King of Fighters 95, and the upcoming Tomb Raider Legends.

676
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:46,313
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

677
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I already bought that game.

678
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:16,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my money?

679
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

680
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,462
[SPEAKER_03]: All these games are old.

681
00:45:21,403 --> 00:45:23,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people probably already have them.

682
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:25,045
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, it is the internet.

683
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:27,126
[SPEAKER_07]: There are ways to getting stuff free.

684
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:30,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Did GameTap open that up for those folks that are playing those?

685
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:31,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Can they still play them online?

686
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:34,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have access to the head-to-head service on there?

687
00:45:36,411 --> 00:45:36,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

688
00:45:37,431 --> 00:45:39,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some of them will have online co-op.

689
00:45:39,692 --> 00:45:40,333
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

690
00:45:40,353 --> 00:45:40,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal Slug.

691
00:45:41,337 --> 00:45:44,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe now I can play with some of the cheapskates and won't pay for GameTap.

692
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:46,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I can play some games with them online.

693
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:49,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I will pay so we can play real Metal Slug.

694
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could just come to my house.

695
00:45:53,281 --> 00:46:02,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you could just wait until, I don't know, Metal Slug eventually comes to Xbox Live Arcade because, you know, SNK loves re-releasing that damn game.

696
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:06,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Raven's Dolphin confirms it does have online multiplayer.

697
00:46:06,826 --> 00:46:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

698
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:08,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

699
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:10,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you have it.

700
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:17,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I wanted to mention briefly, I saw in some interview somewhere that GameTap is still being worked on for the Mac.

701
00:46:18,185 --> 00:46:19,566
[SPEAKER_06]: And it could be coming out very soon.

702
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:20,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they had a date on that.

703
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:22,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Which makes Loki very happy.

704
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,171
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I'll make many Mac fans out there very happy.

705
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:26,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be very cool.

706
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:27,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, why would it make me happy?

707
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:28,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't own a Mac.

708
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:30,036
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a joke.

709
00:46:30,076 --> 00:46:31,297
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we call in the industry, a joke.

710
00:46:31,544 --> 00:46:32,305
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

711
00:46:50,563 --> 00:46:53,805
[SPEAKER_03]: The first Sega games that I played, Rob, were on the ColecoVision.

712
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:55,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the ColecoVision.

713
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:59,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sad that I sold my ColecoVision to get a Super Nintendo.

714
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:00,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another one.

715
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:02,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I had 70 games at one time.

716
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to go to flea markets and buy that shit for a buck each.

717
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:07,272
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can find my second one, would you like it?

718
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:12,615
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because, yeah, that time is long past.

719
00:47:13,275 --> 00:47:17,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about hooking up the Atari 5200 the other day, just for kicks.

720
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:23,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, just for kicks, Gold Farmers like to annoy the shit out of me in World of Warcraft.

721
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:32,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, I know not all our listeners play World of Warcraft, but if you've been playing in the past month, huge problems with spammers on there.

722
00:47:32,698 --> 00:47:35,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold Farmers just going crazy in the game, sending tells.

723
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:45,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the cool thing is that with the latest patch, Blizzard really put the smack down on it, and what they did is that now you can just right-click on a name and report them for spam automatically, and

724
00:47:45,984 --> 00:47:46,264
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

725
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:16,556
[SPEAKER_06]: They went a step further and said this, Blizzard has filed a federal lawsuit against the operators of Peons for Hire, which is a popular gold-selling organization, which many of you have no doubt seen advertised, because they were the ones that were really spamming in the game.

726
00:48:17,816 --> 00:48:25,318
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of the lawsuit, the operators of Peons for Hire have been asked to immediately cease all in-game spamming efforts by all entities and websites under their control.

727
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:27,739
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Blizzard's now putting the smackdown in court.

728
00:48:28,379 --> 00:48:32,880
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, it hasn't stopped, because now what they do, they'll send you party invites...

729
00:48:33,655 --> 00:48:35,096
[SPEAKER_06]: and then send you the spam.

730
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:38,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just automatically decline party invites I'm not expecting.

731
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think I don't party with anybody but who I know?

732
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I know.

733
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,181
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.

734
00:48:42,201 --> 00:48:47,885
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's annoying because when you get a party invite, it goes, and the little thing pops up on the screen.

735
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:56,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the TGFRCVHJI has invited you to a party, which is just some spammer who hit their keyboard.

736
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just annoying because you're trying to kill somebody and then...

737
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:05,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and Blizzard has partnered up with Capcom to get Phoenix Wright on the case.

738
00:49:05,962 --> 00:49:06,842
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll get those spammers.

739
00:49:06,942 --> 00:49:07,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

740
00:49:08,203 --> 00:49:08,824
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll get them.

741
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:12,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Phoenix Wright 5 versus the gold spammers.

742
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:13,866
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

743
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:14,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see it now.

744
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:15,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

745
00:49:16,468 --> 00:49:23,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if anybody is interested, because, you know, Activision is just, well, we hear things now and again.

746
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:31,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But according to their financial report, they're stating that Enemy Territory Quake Wars will be out by the end of summer.

747
00:49:33,385 --> 00:49:37,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually was on paper to be due during the second quarter of the fiscal 2008.

748
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

749
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:48,251
[SPEAKER_03]: However, all they're saying is that it's still just going to be done when it's done.

750
00:49:49,412 --> 00:49:49,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

751
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:52,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me consult my magic eight ball here.

752
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:55,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Signs point to end of August.

753
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:57,196
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what everybody else is saying.

754
00:49:58,936 --> 00:50:00,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, your magic 8-ball, huh?

755
00:50:01,037 --> 00:50:02,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Invisible 8-ball.

756
00:50:02,857 --> 00:50:04,838
[SPEAKER_06]: The 8-ball we don't speak about, ever.

757
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:07,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially when Namco's in the room.

758
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:10,079
[SPEAKER_02]: La, la, la.

759
00:50:10,439 --> 00:50:11,839
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an 8-ball, not a Katamari.

760
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:12,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see.

761
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:13,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

762
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,400
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

763
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

764
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:15,680
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

765
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

766
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:16,541
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

767
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:18,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us some other stuff.

768
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:23,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, excuse me, DarkSakura!

769
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:24,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you didn't do it right.

770
00:50:25,576 --> 00:50:27,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I don't want Rob to say anything else.

771
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:30,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.

772
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Rob D., I heart you.

773
00:50:32,881 --> 00:50:34,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob is not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.

774
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:39,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're taking over as our mediator here.

775
00:50:40,827 --> 00:50:41,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord help us.

776
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:49,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw something at... where's the ferret?

777
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:51,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a Kirby?

778
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:52,593
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a Jigglypuff.

779
00:50:52,613 --> 00:50:53,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see Jigglypuff.

780
00:50:53,354 --> 00:50:53,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll throw it at Rob.

781
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:55,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't reach Jigglypuff.

782
00:50:55,075 --> 00:50:56,976
[SPEAKER_06]: The best part is, he sent me two.

783
00:50:57,776 --> 00:51:00,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, excuse me again, DarkSakura.

784
00:51:07,102 --> 00:51:08,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit Rob in the shoulder with a Jigglypuff.

785
00:51:10,124 --> 00:51:13,126
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the best fucking listeners of any radio program on anywhere.

786
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:13,706
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't.

787
00:51:13,726 --> 00:51:14,386
[SPEAKER_01]: You suck.

788
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:15,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to hell.

789
00:51:16,288 --> 00:51:16,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

790
00:51:18,496 --> 00:51:19,656
[SPEAKER_07]: So surprise!

791
00:51:20,156 --> 00:51:26,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XIII has hit its... Well, probably not the first, but one of the many delays.

792
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:30,359
[SPEAKER_07]: This being Final Fantasy XIII Versus has been put on hold.

793
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:42,842
[SPEAKER_07]: According to an interview with Dengeki PlayStation of Japan, Final Fantasy main man Tetsuya Nomura has revealed that he likes to only work on one project at a time.

794
00:51:43,522 --> 00:51:44,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously right now...

795
00:51:46,147 --> 00:51:47,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy XIII Final Fantasy XIII

796
00:52:07,857 --> 00:52:11,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Release only one Final Fantasy game at a time.

797
00:52:11,978 --> 00:52:23,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't make 13-1, 13-2, 13-B, 13... I mean, it... You got a little happy with 7, because 7 was so popular, and it sold well, then you started doing this shit with 12.

798
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking money-hungry bitches.

799
00:52:27,721 --> 00:52:30,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make one game only.

800
00:52:30,686 --> 00:52:33,868
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if people like the game, they'll say, hey, I want more!

801
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:38,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of saying, hey, we have 13 games coming out for Final Fantasy XIII, collect them all.

802
00:52:40,534 --> 00:52:42,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta catch them all, Final Fantasy.

803
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:42,295

[SPEAKER_07]: Kristen Novalis.

00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:51,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what that sounds like?

807
00:52:51,082 --> 00:52:53,684
[SPEAKER_07]: What was it, one of those Telemundo shows or whatever?

808
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:55,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Kristen Novalis.

[SPEAKER_06]: Fabulous Christian Novella!

812
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:12,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems like none of this other news even matters anymore.

813
00:53:13,904 --> 00:53:25,506
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Electronic Arts out of Canada recently lifted the embargo going on for the upcoming PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 racer Need for Speed Pro Street.

818

[SPEAKER_06]: You can totally see in one of these screenshots here like a Drag Race kind of mode, pretty cool.

819
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:15,464
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I really would love the CEA to make?

820
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:15,964
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

821
00:54:16,244 --> 00:54:17,504

00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:04,934
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an exciting... This makes for great radio, doesn't it?

829
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:06,975
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the soundtrack I have to look forward to.

830
00:55:08,557 --> 00:55:10,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this is great.

831
00:55:10,538 --> 00:55:10,818
I remember.

832
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:15,582
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looped that same thing over and over again.

833
00:55:31,421 --> 00:55:32,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm ready for the mailbag.

834
00:55:35,823 --> 00:55:37,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

835
00:55:37,925 --> 00:55:38,985
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura reads them.

836
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:39,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Here she goes.

837
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:46,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

838
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:47,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?

839
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:48,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Dying a plague.

840
00:55:50,573 --> 00:55:52,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, excuse me!

841
00:55:52,754 --> 00:55:53,815
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura!

842
00:55:54,555 --> 00:55:55,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

843
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:56,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, any...

844
00:55:58,226 --> 00:55:59,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn off the damn music!

845
00:55:59,787 --> 00:56:00,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

846
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:07,012
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to... You know, I was just over my PMS and you've made it worse.

847
00:56:11,355 --> 00:56:12,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I single-handedly brought it back.

848
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, read an email.

849
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:17,659
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one from VoteForDan, I guess.

850
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:19,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not voting for him.

851
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, DrBurst, I'm sorry.

852
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:26,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think WoW will come to the Xbox 360?

853
00:56:26,264 --> 00:56:27,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I answer this one already?

854
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:29,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we do that one last week?

855
00:56:30,103 --> 00:56:31,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I already answered this last week.

856
00:56:31,884 --> 00:56:32,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Download the old podcast.

857
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:34,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I will anyways.

858
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:35,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

859
00:56:36,489 --> 00:56:37,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everyone at OLR.

860
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:45,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to write a quick email to let you know that I listen to your podcasts every time a new one comes out and I have access to download it to my mp3 player.

861
00:56:45,658 --> 00:56:47,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen to all your podcasts multiple times while I'm working.

862
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Each opinion from the OLR staff is extremely appreciated.

863
00:56:51,604 --> 00:56:54,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a member on GameTrailers.com with the username NarutoCastle.

864
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:59,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be giving OLR a plug on my blog when I get a spare moment to write one on there.

865
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:01,509
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll let you know when it's up.

866
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:04,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Final Fantasy 3 and enjoying it a lot.

867
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:08,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannot wait for Final Fantasy 4 and Final Fantasy 5 to come out on Nintendo DS.

868
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for reading my email.

869
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:10,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

870
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:12,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Gregory in Australia.

871
00:57:14,011 --> 00:57:18,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the plug in your blog, because that's like word-of-mouth advertising, which is so essential for us.

872
00:57:18,514 --> 00:57:27,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of which, he also writes back and says, Hi guys, Greg here again, updating on my blog that lets GameTrailer members know about OLR.

873
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:35,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to take a look at the blog, go to GameTrailers.com and search for user NarutoCastle, and you'll see blogs, and most recent should be the OLR blog.

874
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:40,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Always doing my best to spread the word to as many people as I can, who either listen to podcasts or are into video games.

875
00:57:41,309 --> 00:57:43,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for a great podcast, and keep up the great work.

876
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:46,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, thank you.

877
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:46,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

878
00:57:46,825 --> 00:57:50,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wasn't there a question there amongst all the lovey-dovey stuff?

879
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:51,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

880
00:57:51,648 --> 00:57:51,828
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

881
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought there was a question at the beginning of his first email.

882
00:57:54,269 --> 00:57:54,689
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well.

883
00:57:55,249 --> 00:57:57,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have another one from Xenore, I guess how it's spelled.

884
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,012
[SPEAKER_03]: X-E-N-O-O-R-E.

885
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:02,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, love the show.

886
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:04,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Been listening for a few episodes here and there.

887
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Your group dynamic always brings smiles to my cheeks.

888
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:11,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of my squad of geek gamers from times long past.

889
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:12,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the awesome work.

890
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:19,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently during some banter amongst the group, you commented on the combat system of Final Fantasy XII.

891
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Your discussion intrigued me enough to give the game a shot.

892
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:25,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope Squeenix sends you a big check for your promotion skills.

893
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Best luck to you guys in the future, Zenur.

894
00:58:28,301 --> 00:58:31,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard that expression before, bring a smile to my cheeks.

895
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:35,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope you're not talking about your ass cheeks, because that's not a compliment.

896
00:58:35,405 --> 00:58:37,426
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't smile on your ass, damn it.

897
00:58:37,654 --> 00:58:38,575
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell is wrong with you?

898
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:02,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Robway Gets 50 Points

899
00:59:21,755 --> 00:59:22,735
[SPEAKER_06]: for Gryffindor.

900
00:59:22,795 --> 00:59:23,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

901
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:27,918
[SPEAKER_06]: What can we give the listeners to do cool stuff like this?

902
00:59:28,018 --> 00:59:28,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

903
00:59:28,678 --> 00:59:29,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Mad props, I suppose.

904
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not... I mean... A dollar.

905
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,940
[SPEAKER_06]: The cars that people have been... That's right.

906
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, if you send us... Okay, here you go.

907
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:36,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we will do that.

908
00:59:37,082 --> 00:59:41,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, if you will send us your PayPal, assuming... I don't know if it's your regular email, if you have a separate email.

909
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:46,246
[SPEAKER_06]: We will PayPal you $1 courtesy of Orange Launch Radio for your awesomeness for this car.

910
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:47,146
[SPEAKER_03]: You should frame it, too.

911
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:51,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming from Rob's favorite person, Sakura Max.

912
00:59:54,255 --> 00:59:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, this guy.

913
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:56,115
[SPEAKER_06]: How old is he, 11?

914
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:56,115
12.

915
00:59:57,056 --> 00:59:57,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, big difference.

916
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:02,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick email to say happy birthday, Jamie Rules, Loki is cool, Sky sucks.

917
01:00:03,678 --> 01:00:04,878
[SPEAKER_03]: They had lots of dots after it.

918
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:06,959
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Bimani music is cool.

919
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:11,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sad because some 12-year-old on the internet hates me.

920
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:12,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Boo-hoo, what am I going to do?

921
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of funny.

922
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:16,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked for DarkSakuraHateMail, not SkyHateMail.

923
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:17,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Why aren't you people listening?

924
01:00:17,645 --> 01:00:22,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Signed, SakuraMax, 12-year-old listener, one with the best email closings, wants a pet, grew, and loves Pokey.

925
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:24,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you even read his emails?

926
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:25,433
[SPEAKER_06]: They bring nothing to the show.

927
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:27,434
[SPEAKER_06]: They bring nothing to the show.

928
01:00:27,474 --> 01:00:28,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I just totally make an OLR car.

929
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:32,115
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm supposed to get this game later this week, Forza 2, by the way.

930
01:00:32,255 --> 01:00:34,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no interest in Forza 2 whatsoever.

931
01:00:34,295 --> 01:00:35,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't either, but, you know.

932
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:36,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, last email.

933
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:37,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft hooks me up sometimes.

934
01:00:37,976 --> 01:00:39,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, OLR crew, it's GS68.

935
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:44,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoyed the OLR panel at Fanime, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again next year.

936
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:45,938
[SPEAKER_03]: How is Fanime anyhow?

937
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:47,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Any good stories to share?

938
01:00:49,017 --> 01:00:49,857
[SPEAKER_03]: That was from GS68.

939
01:00:50,017 --> 01:01:02,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was me deciding that my costume wasn't going to work and going in the dealer's room and dropping $120 to buy the stuff for my Iroka costume, and I ended up doing chick style.

940
01:01:02,682 --> 01:01:03,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have a loan?

941
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:03,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

942
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:05,303
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

943
01:01:06,284 --> 01:01:08,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I got yelled at by my husband.

944
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:08,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

945
01:01:09,225 --> 01:01:11,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Over breakfast.

946
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:15,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought a bit generation game called Colorist, and I have no idea how to play it.

947
01:01:16,513 --> 01:01:18,174
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a porn star's autograph too, didn't you?

948
01:01:18,194 --> 01:01:20,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a porn star's autograph for my wife, and she loved that.

949
01:01:21,356 --> 01:01:23,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got two Harry Potter pictures for my wife.

950
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:24,938
[SPEAKER_07]: She liked that as well.

951
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:29,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's one other thing I thought I got her as well.

952
01:01:30,602 --> 01:01:31,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

953
01:01:32,243 --> 01:01:33,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought one shirt.

954
01:01:33,163 --> 01:01:35,285
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing I bought at all I found in May was a shirt.

955
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:36,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Dan the best thing.

956
01:01:36,786 --> 01:01:36,966
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

957
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I got him the Goomba that makes noise.

958
01:01:39,147 --> 01:01:39,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that thing was cool.

959
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:40,488
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing you hit and it goes...

960
01:01:41,712 --> 01:01:45,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you hit it one more time and it does the You're Dead music.

961
01:01:46,314 --> 01:01:49,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I went back looking for the coin box and they didn't have it.

962
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:54,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you keep hitting the coin box and every tenth one it gives you a one-up.

963
01:01:54,657 --> 01:01:58,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And this isn't intended as a plug, but you can order them from WYSIWYG.

964
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:01,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I got my Goomba from.

965
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I also got a Totekeke.

966
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:07,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got a shirt that said Grand Theft Amish, Penn State Dutch.

967
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:10,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, from the same booth that he got that shirt, I got one.

968
01:02:10,926 --> 01:02:14,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually posted a picture of the shirt in my All Games blog.

969
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:18,110
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to see that, it's community.allgames.com.

970
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,010
[SPEAKER_06]: How the hell do you get there?

971
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:21,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Green Sky is my username on there.

972
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:22,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Just find me on there.

973
01:02:23,404 --> 01:02:25,746
[SPEAKER_06]: and I posted a picture of the shirt I got.

974
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:29,508
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, This is Zelda!

975
01:02:29,709 --> 01:02:34,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has basically, they took a picture of the guy from 300, they took a picture of his face and put the Zelda hat on him.

976
01:02:34,472 --> 01:02:35,893
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really funny if you see it.

977
01:02:35,933 --> 01:02:36,473
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

978
01:02:36,493 --> 01:02:37,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that one, yeah.

979
01:02:38,094 --> 01:02:40,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even see 300 and I get the joke, so I thought it was great.

980
01:02:41,356 --> 01:02:41,736
[SPEAKER_06]: How was that?

981
01:02:41,937 --> 01:02:42,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the shirt I got.

982
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:48,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't mention during my gaming week, though, since he asked about how was the rest of Fonamate.

983
01:02:49,444 --> 01:02:54,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I got there right before our panel started, I didn't get to spend much time there, but I went to the game room afterwards.

984
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:55,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I went the day after.

985
01:02:56,126 --> 01:02:59,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played some pop-up music on a Melo 2, and I got the high score on the machine.

986
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:06,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot how to get high speed, and my dumbass picked the Galaxy Express 3.9 TV theme, which is fucking slow!

987
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can put high speed on that one, at least I don't know how.

988
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:10,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't figure it out either.

989
01:03:10,851 --> 01:03:11,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I...

990
01:03:11,627 --> 01:03:14,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, I can play poppin' music better than this.

991
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, however, play like a crap ton of Dance Maniacs.

992
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:21,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had Parapara Shadowing going on.

993
01:03:22,654 --> 01:03:23,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, nerds.

994
01:03:23,314 --> 01:03:24,154
[SPEAKER_03]: With people who could do it.

995
01:03:24,214 --> 01:03:24,655
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good.

996
01:03:24,955 --> 01:03:25,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

997
01:03:26,176 --> 01:03:26,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

998
01:03:27,376 --> 01:03:28,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll be back if they'll have us.

999
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:37,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And the best part was hanging out with DJ Ranma S. The best part was the mini-disc player recorded the show this time.

1000
01:03:37,342 --> 01:03:37,923
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1001
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:38,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

1002
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:39,824
[SPEAKER_07]: The show didn't come out too bad.

1003
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:40,204
[SPEAKER_07]: It did.

1004
01:03:40,885 --> 01:03:42,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Weird shit, and I don't know why.

1005
01:03:42,425 --> 01:03:46,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably has something to do with the fact that the battery is slowly eating itself away.

1006
01:03:46,986 --> 01:03:53,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and the other great part, we found out that Loki's Mac Heckler lives in town, so we're going to have him on a future show.

1007
01:03:54,888 --> 01:04:00,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I found something cool, too, and I'm going to... Actually, next week's Side of the Week is probably going to be a plug for this guy's site.

1008
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:09,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I hung out a lot in Artist Alley, because me being an artist and having a bunch of my friends in there, I had to go and hang out with the artsy-fartsy people.

1009
01:04:10,072 --> 01:04:34,172
[SPEAKER_03]: and it turned out that I got more photos taken of me wearing my Tron shirt with my Dolphy than in costume which was sort of sad but I also bought this great print of Iron Man for Sauce and this guy drew me Deadpool and he said that he'd do a full color print for me and he actually lives in the Sacramento area so I'm going to plug his site next week

1010
01:04:34,734 --> 01:04:36,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I know which guy you're talking about.

1011
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:39,198
[SPEAKER_07]: The guy that does all the comic stuff and he's at like every single anime convention.

1012
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:41,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I think he's even at the Sacramento one sometime.

1013
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:49,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was supposed to be here, yeah, but I'm going to give him a call about the commission for the picture because he did a really freaking good job.

1014
01:04:49,507 --> 01:04:52,950
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Sak anime convention coming up this weekend.

1015
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't go because I'm in New York.

1016
01:04:54,111 --> 01:04:54,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this weekend, is it?

1017
01:04:55,091 --> 01:04:56,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's coming up this next weekend.

1018
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, next weekend, yeah.

1019
01:04:57,714 --> 01:04:59,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll go to the mall anyways.

1020
01:05:00,071 --> 01:05:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think it's the one at the temple.

1021
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:02,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, forget it.

1022
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:04,532
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about it offline.

1023
01:05:05,293 --> 01:05:10,114
[SPEAKER_06]: But hey, if you run an automate convention, you want us to come do a live panel, we're open to suggestions.

1024
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:19,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, sweet, to the Rob D. We're kind of broke and can't travel too much, but we're certainly open to hearing suggestions, especially anything that goes on in Northern California or Southern California.

1025
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:21,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Northern Nevada, someplace we can drive to.

1026
01:05:22,524 --> 01:05:33,326
[SPEAKER_03]: No, to the Rob D, they said that they did Anime Hell at ASEN, and I didn't know, but they put the full Sega Tatsunoshiro video in that, which is like, anyone who's a Sega fan has to have seen that.

1027
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:34,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

1028
01:05:35,707 --> 01:05:39,548
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the epitome of the Sega Saturn advertising era.

1029
01:05:40,928 --> 01:05:41,168
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1030
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,008
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get back into some news, though.

1031
01:05:43,308 --> 01:05:44,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough talk about conventions.

1032
01:05:45,689 --> 01:05:47,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Where shall we go for another story?

1033
01:05:48,106 --> 01:05:48,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to me.

1034
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:50,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about the PSP.

1035
01:05:51,327 --> 01:05:54,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony releases its uncrackable firmware 3.5.

1036
01:05:55,548 --> 01:06:02,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It adds a bunch of new features including remote play so you have the ability to play anything that's on your PS3.

1037
01:06:02,589 --> 01:06:07,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, movies and whatnot over the internet on your PSP.

1038
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:11,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, let's see here.

1039
01:06:11,031 --> 01:06:16,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, also it enhances some of the RSS feeds and stuff like that.

1040
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:19,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, interesting.

1041
01:06:20,406 --> 01:06:27,652
[SPEAKER_07]: One other feature that they forgot to mention, uh, it is actually very crackable and got cracked almost, uh, actually I think a day before it came out.

1042
01:06:29,214 --> 01:06:29,974
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's possible.

1043
01:06:30,555 --> 01:06:43,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But, uh, yeah, so now they're working on a new custom firmware for, uh, 3.5, and it was kind of funny because they actually used the tools from 3.3 to crack it, and apparently it wasn't that hard, so...

1044
01:06:45,963 --> 01:06:49,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that their unhackable firmware?

1045
01:06:49,604 --> 01:06:50,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, their unhackable firmware.

1046
01:06:52,084 --> 01:06:53,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Each firmware is unhackable, you understand.

1047
01:06:54,525 --> 01:06:54,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1048
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:56,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't do it.

1049
01:06:57,105 --> 01:06:57,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Just can't.

1050
01:06:58,086 --> 01:06:58,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Just can't.

1051
01:06:58,906 --> 01:06:59,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It's impossible.

1052
01:07:00,986 --> 01:07:01,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Sad.

1053
01:07:01,906 --> 01:07:05,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, speaking of unhacking PSPs, it was very interesting.

1054
01:07:06,087 --> 01:07:09,688
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been taking apart PSPs to fix them.

1055
01:07:10,168 --> 01:07:14,129
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend's analog stick was broken and I actually took apart the entire analog stick.

1056
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:15,923
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1057
01:07:38,248 --> 01:07:43,290
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a very interesting statement made by Activision in a conference call they had with investors this week.

1058
01:07:43,711 --> 01:07:44,551
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something else.

1059
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:52,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, keep in mind, Activision acquired the Guitar Hero franchise when they bought out Red Octane, essentially, or their acquisition of Red Octane, whatever you want to call it.

1060
01:07:53,795 --> 01:07:55,236
[SPEAKER_06]: They got the Guitar Hero franchise.

1061
01:07:55,536 --> 01:08:05,460
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting is they have now said about Rock Band, which is coming out, it wasn't surprising that Guitar Hero has attracted imitators.

1062
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:16,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so basically you're saying Rock Band is an imitation of Guitar Hero, except you may remember Harmonix originally made Guitar Hero for Red Octane before you bought it.

1063
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So that comment made no sense at all.

1064
01:08:20,883 --> 01:08:26,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you consider Guitar Freaks came first anyway, by Konami, you all suck.

1065
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:30,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make your games, make them good, and STFU?

1066
01:08:32,438 --> 01:08:36,522
[SPEAKER_07]: and technically they're all rip off of Amplitude anyways, Amplitude and Frequency.

1067
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:43,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the interface of Guitar Hero, that and Karaoke Revolution too a little bit.

1068
01:08:44,509 --> 01:08:49,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, they really pay that guy the big bucks apparently.

1069
01:08:49,693 --> 01:08:51,275
[SPEAKER_07]: He's real on top of everything.

1070
01:08:51,855 --> 01:08:55,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen the gameplay footage of Guitar Hero 3 that's on the internet right now?

1071
01:08:55,538 --> 01:08:58,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty sexy, but it doesn't look that different.

1072
01:08:59,992 --> 01:09:03,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the game that will finally jump the shark for everybody else.

1073
01:09:04,594 --> 01:09:07,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the series jumped the shark already for me with this 80s edition thing.

1074
01:09:08,015 --> 01:09:11,036
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Guitar Hero 3, people are finally going to go, okay, enough.

1075
01:09:11,936 --> 01:09:18,719
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's good that Harmonix, instead of trying to do the same thing over again, is trying to... I give them a lot of credit.

1076
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:19,499
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pretty...

1077
01:09:19,963 --> 01:09:21,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Badass company in many ways.

1078
01:09:21,504 --> 01:09:27,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the fact that they are trying to evolve with the marketplace, with this whole rock band thing, it's a huge risk.

1079
01:09:27,707 --> 01:09:29,268
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, so is Guitar Hero.

1080
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:34,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but I think Activision is going to get left behind with the Guitar Hero franchise.

1081
01:09:34,391 --> 01:09:36,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be... I don't know.

1082
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be kind of like Guitar Freaks was.

1083
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, look at Guitar Freaks.

1084
01:09:41,455 --> 01:09:45,277
[SPEAKER_07]: How many versions of that game have come out and really they haven't innovated on each other?

1085
01:09:45,577 --> 01:09:47,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet for some reason they're still doing well in Japan.

1086
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:48,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of funky, but...

1087
01:09:49,944 --> 01:09:51,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can either have one of two things.

1088
01:09:51,385 --> 01:09:55,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Either it's going to still do very well, or it's just going to tank.

1089
01:09:56,149 --> 01:10:03,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people are going to start figuring out, hey, maybe spending all this money on this guitar game each time around is not a good idea.

1090
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:10,741
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like why DDR is starting to dip down a little bit in popularity, especially when it's coming out on all these new platforms.

1091
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:12,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy all new hardware for this shit.

1092
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we haven't heard a lot about what's going on in the DDR world in a while.

1093
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:22,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess maybe by the time E3 or whatever the hell it is.

1094
01:10:22,263 --> 01:10:23,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly though, I mean, come on.

1095
01:10:24,065 --> 01:10:29,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, think of all the things that we probably would have expected with the 360 version.

1096
01:10:29,369 --> 01:10:33,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really, the 360 version is just a prettied up version of the Xbox One.

1097
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:44,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one for the Nintendo Wii when it comes out, it's pretty much just PlayStation 2 version of Supernova with Wiimote crap thrown on there.

1098
01:10:44,162 --> 01:10:44,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

1099
01:10:45,237 --> 01:10:47,119
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very... I was going to say, I guess we have Wii DDR.

1100
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:50,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very... I don't know.

1101
01:10:50,762 --> 01:10:52,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Very non-innovative.

1102
01:10:52,503 --> 01:11:00,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, granted, yeah, great, you're doing stuff with the Wiimote, but you don't... I don't think you really need to do stuff with the Wiimote.

1103
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just like the iToy.

1104
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:04,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the iToy support was there.

1105
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:05,614
[SPEAKER_07]: It was ridiculous.

1106
01:11:07,015 --> 01:11:08,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even remotely fun.

1107
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:10,518
[SPEAKER_07]: It made you look like a complete ass.

1108
01:11:10,878 --> 01:11:12,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

1109
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, anyway, sorry, we've...

1110
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: We've definitely beat this story into the ground, but just a dumb comment made by that guy at Activision.

1111
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:21,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a dumb comment.

1112
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,601
[SPEAKER_03]: When have we heard much smart from that guy at Activision?

1113
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:27,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear, doesn't he hang out with Kutaragi?

1114
01:11:28,142 --> 01:11:30,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't know, maybe they all have a secret bar they drink at all day.

1115
01:11:31,123 --> 01:11:32,163
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean crayon juice?

1116
01:11:33,124 --> 01:11:39,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, something though that's pretty cool, well at least if you're into it, is that...

1117
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:45,242
[SPEAKER_03]: S&K Playmore is to be releasing... A new game?

1118
01:11:46,623 --> 01:11:47,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

1119
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:55,129
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1, which is Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury 2, Fatal Fury 3, and Fatal Fury Special.

1120
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:56,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so close!

1121
01:11:59,352 --> 01:12:01,354
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, we get old school, my booty.

1122
01:12:01,694 --> 01:12:04,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to be redoing any of the graphics whatsoever?

1123
01:12:05,857 --> 01:12:06,137
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1124
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:07,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1125
01:12:07,638 --> 01:12:07,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1126
01:12:09,133 --> 01:12:10,454
[SPEAKER_01]: But that'd be arcade quality.

1127
01:12:10,694 --> 01:12:11,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, whoopee.

1128
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:13,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't those games come out 10 years ago?

1129
01:12:13,995 --> 01:12:16,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, Fatal Fury Special, I think, came out in 95.

1130
01:12:16,517 --> 01:12:21,199
[SPEAKER_07]: To give them credit, their Art of Fighting collection was only $14.99 for the PlayStation 2.

1131
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:29,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the one thing that I liked about the Fatal Fury games that I thought was innovative was the, for old 2D fighters, was having the multi-plane.

1132
01:12:30,344 --> 01:12:34,386
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you couldn't really tell which plane they were on, but you had the front and back.

1133
01:12:35,326 --> 01:12:37,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love Fatal Fury, don't get me wrong.

1134
01:12:37,427 --> 01:12:38,728
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my favorite, like,

1135
01:12:40,382 --> 01:12:42,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat were kind of up on this.

1136
01:12:42,883 --> 01:12:44,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, Street Fighter was up on a freaking pedestal.

1137
01:12:44,905 --> 01:12:46,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat was close behind.

1138
01:12:46,706 --> 01:12:50,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he had all these other knockoff fighting games below, right?

1139
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,149
[SPEAKER_06]: In the 90s, right?

1140
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:53,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say Fatal Fury was my favorite of that bunch.

1141
01:12:54,311 --> 01:12:56,252
[SPEAKER_06]: More so than anything else SNK put out.

1142
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:59,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Fatal Fury paved the way for King of Fighters, and that makes me happy.

1143
01:13:00,235 --> 01:13:03,617
[SPEAKER_07]: No, here's what SNK needs to do.

1144
01:13:04,077 --> 01:13:06,259
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, great, you're releasing games and stuff.

1145
01:13:06,872 --> 01:13:09,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Just re-release, like, Neo Geo collections.

1146
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,354
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, have, you know, Magical Lord.

1147
01:13:12,474 --> 01:13:14,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Have, you know, the Fatal Fear games.

1148
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:15,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Slug.

1149
01:13:15,616 --> 01:13:17,957
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, all this stuff together.

1150
01:13:18,657 --> 01:13:22,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of just, here's two games that you bought before.

1151
01:13:22,378 --> 01:13:23,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's Metal Slug yet again.

1152
01:13:23,619 --> 01:13:24,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's, you know, this stuff.

1153
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:27,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And then add some... Yeah, but who really bought that stuff?

1154
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Those cartridges were like $500.

1155
01:13:28,421 --> 01:13:29,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1156
01:13:29,981 --> 01:13:32,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, though, they've re... You are a crazy bitch.

1157
01:13:32,522 --> 01:13:33,783
[SPEAKER_06]: You're in your own category.

1158
01:13:33,803 --> 01:13:36,484
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, though, they've re-released these games numerous times.

1159
01:13:37,259 --> 01:13:39,360
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, a lot of them we got through trade.

1160
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,642
[SPEAKER_03]: The only one that we paid over $300 for was King of Fighters 2000.

1161
01:13:44,103 --> 01:13:44,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Only?

1162
01:13:45,443 --> 01:13:48,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a $60 Xbox 360 game and I cry.

1163
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:52,167
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, but we have a lot more bills now, so we don't do that anymore.

1164
01:13:53,287 --> 01:13:55,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I really want Samurai Shodown 5.

1165
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:56,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Really.

1166
01:13:57,429 --> 01:13:58,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the last Neo Geo game.

1167
01:13:58,570 --> 01:13:59,530
