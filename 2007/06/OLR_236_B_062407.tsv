0	4700	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream
4700	5700	twice weekly.
5700	12220	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links
12220	15460	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15460	20540	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20540	26260	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this part B of episode number 236 and
26260	29100	this of course is our fifth year anniversary show.
29100	30100	That's right.
30100	36780	On June 23, 2002, we went live for the very first time with Orange Lounge Radio live episode
36780	41540	number one where some of the topics included, God, what were we talking about that week?
41540	42540	I don't even remember.
42540	44500	I think it was kind of more like an intro to the show when we were talking about our
44500	48900	experiences playing various games at Golf Land and things like that.
48900	52340	I remember in episode number two and three early on in the show we started to get into
52340	58220	that whole controversy about how like needles were showing up in the background in DDR Solo.
58220	59220	Remember that?
59220	60220	Yeah.
60220	61220	Back in the day.
61220	64360	But we've grown a lot since then and now we talk about all types of games because as we
64360	70340	said back in 2006 when we merged our shows, we're gaming fans first and music games just
70340	72580	happen to be a little subsection of that.
72580	78660	But I thought for those of you guys that have been listening for as long as you have, unfortunately
78660	83660	the full first episode is on a backup drive somewhere that I wasn't able to access today
83660	85020	so I couldn't find it.
85020	86280	But I do have this.
86280	90860	We used to run little promo spots on our station that would flash back the episode.
90860	95740	So here was the highlight clip, or shall we say, from the very first episode of Orange
95740	98860	Lounge Radio.
98860	101300	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
101300	105540	Attention to parents at Golf Land, and this goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but
105540	106540	any golf land.
106540	107540	Any arcade.
107540	108540	Because Jamie circulates a lot.
108540	109540	She gets around, Jamie.
109540	110540	Oh, yeah.
110540	111540	Baby.
111540	112540	Every different arcade.
112540	113540	Who gets around?
113540	114540	I'm six and arcade four.
114540	115540	If you don't, mother your child.
115540	116540	Baby will.
116540	117540	Yes.
117540	118540	I will spank your child.
118540	121100	If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.
121100	125100	Join us every Sunday night from seven o'clock until nine o'clock.
125100	127420	No, the times have changed.
127420	128420	The times have changed.
128420	130020	But there you have it.
130020	134980	So look, Dark Sakura was kind of a jerk from episode one.
134980	135980	I'm not.
135980	136980	I'm teasing.
136980	137980	I'm teasing.
137980	141500	I got tired of, because ever since that woman tried to change her baby's diaper on the keyboard
141500	144300	mania, I was like, oh God.
144300	149540	In fact, today, I have a modification to that.
149540	155900	If you won't take care of your child, I will have someone kill you, because I'm not going
155900	156900	to take care of your child.
156900	157900	Wow.
157900	158900	I don't know about that.
158900	161620	I'll have you shot in the head.
161620	163340	Head shot for the win.
163340	167020	Press A. Some users in chat are commenting on the quality
167020	168020	of that clip.
168020	169020	That's right.
169020	171820	When Orange Launch Radio started, we were on a dial-up friendly stream.
171820	176360	So the stream you could hear was usable on 56K modems, because five years ago, a lot
176360	178420	of people still were on those.
178420	182380	By the way, do you still own the drive that you have that saved on?
182380	183380	Somewhere.
183380	184380	I don't know.
184380	186060	If you can find it, I may have a way to extract it.
186060	187060	That's cool.
187060	188580	No, I think we have it on CD back up somewhere too.
188580	190740	If nonetheless- If we could get a hold of a certain somebody,
190740	191740	we could get it.
191740	195780	There's a certain angel that might come to our rescue that I know has every episode of
195780	196780	OLR.
196780	197780	You know what?
197780	198780	I'm just going to ask her right now.
198780	199780	If she's around, please do.
199780	200780	On my journal.
200780	201780	All right.
201780	203140	I'll put that up for download or something.
203140	207860	But anyway, so yeah, this is a little bit of an ego episode, I guess.
207860	209300	We're done with the gaming news.
209300	211540	We did it in part A, although I have to say this real quick.
211540	213140	One little piece of gaming news.
213140	216380	Because we tape live on Sunday nights, as we have for the past five years, sometimes
216380	220940	things change as the show is going on, and that's what's happening tonight.
220940	226120	Thank you, Rene, for the news tip here, but Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q, just posted
226120	230660	about the whole addiction story and the AMA we were talking about in the first part.
230660	235260	Apparently it's come down the wire that the doctors from the AMA have backed away from
235260	236360	their decision.
236360	239840	They're now recommending that the American Psychiatric Association, who kind of would
239840	244500	be the final judge and jury in this anyway, do a little more research, quote, there is
244500	250160	nothing here to suggest that this is a complex physiological disease state akin to alcoholism
250160	254700	or other substance abuse disorders, and it doesn't get to have the word addiction attached
254700	255700	to it.
255700	260460	That comes from Dr. Stuart Gitlow, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and also Mount
260460	264900	Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
264900	269220	Things change while we're live.
269220	270620	I kind of figured it would be.
270620	275620	Like I said in part A, addiction is kind of a part of something bigger.
275620	276620	I don't think it's addiction.
276620	278620	I think it's OCD.
278620	283460	Well, anyhow, as we promised here in part B, we have a pizza on the way.
283460	284460	We're just going to...
284460	287460	Our bread and cheese to go with our wine.
287460	292300	We're going to just kind of kick back and relax because, as we've said a lot this evening,
292300	294300	Orange Launch Radio is about you guys.
294300	299340	We get asked all the time, when we started this, there wasn't really a lot on the internet
299340	300500	like us.
300500	301500	There was a few other...
301500	302900	I'm not saying that as an ego thing.
302900	304380	I'm just saying that's kind of the way it was.
304380	305380	There wasn't a lot of...
305380	309800	I'm not trying to say we were pioneers or whatever, but there wasn't a lot of live gaming
309800	311340	shows that taped.
311340	314540	I didn't even find out until years later there was this all-games network that had existed
314540	320140	for 10 years, but funny enough, we started while they were on hiatus because of G4 and
320140	323660	everything, and Scott working at G4, and now it's kind of funny that we work together,
323660	324780	but regardless of all that.
324780	328000	I just say that because I know we've gained a lot of listeners thanks to our partnership
328000	333460	with all games, but there wasn't a lot like us when we started, at least that we knew
333460	334460	about.
334460	338980	It's kind of interesting because now that podcasting is so huge, and essentially any
338980	342900	idiot with a microphone can have a podcast, which really any idiot with a microphone before
342900	345220	could do an internet radio show.
345220	346580	There weren't a lot of people motivated to do it.
346580	349140	It wasn't an easy thing.
349140	350620	We really have to distinguish ourselves.
350620	353980	We get asked a lot, why should I subscribe to your show when there's like 500 other shows
353980	360000	out there I could subscribe to about games, and we've always said because we have true
360000	361260	live interaction.
361260	365740	We like to pretend we're sitting around at a big table with our listeners and just talking
365740	368180	about the latest in gaming.
368180	371260	Sometimes we break stories, although we probably won't be breaking them too much more in the
371260	376060	future, but we're not usually thought of as a source for breaking news.
376060	379140	There's plenty of other game blogs who are paid to bring you breaking news.
379140	380660	We don't get paid for this.
380660	384300	That's kind of what distinguishes us from everybody else is the listeners, the chatters,
384300	386280	the live interaction that we have.
386280	398780	Tonight during part B, we're going to open up the Skype line and let you guys take control.
398780	406340	The Skype line is open, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
406340	410500	Just give us a call and it's open and you can talk about pretty much anything.
410500	411580	It's an open forum tonight.
411580	415700	If you want to say congratulations, then cool, we'll take that and be very thankful for it.
415700	419180	If you want to ask us a question, you can do that too.
419180	422800	If you want to talk about what's been big in gaming for the past five years, you can
422800	424500	do that too.
424500	428860	Let's start it off with a call and we're going to go over here first.
428860	431220	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
431220	432220	Who's this?
432220	433220	Hi, guys.
433220	434660	This is Footy Monster from Argentina.
434660	435980	Wow, I got the first call.
435980	436980	You did?
436980	438740	You got the first call, Footy Monster?
438740	439740	Good for you.
439740	440740	What's on your mind?
440740	444740	Well, first of all, guys, I just wanted to say happy fifth birthday.
444740	447860	You've been with me at least for the last two years when I've actually found you guys
447860	453340	right before you went into iTunes and it's been a great two years, dude.
453340	454340	It's amazing.
454340	458540	We've been there every Sunday, give or take, and it's pretty cool to have that familiar
458540	461340	voice go with you all the time.
461340	465940	I appreciate that and I don't know the other field, but from my perspective, having a listener
465940	471460	from a far away, quote unquote, place like Argentina is really cool to us.
471460	475380	The fact that the internet makes the world smaller in that regard and that we're able
475380	480000	to sit around and talk about gaming, for me, it's very cool and I love hearing from the
480000	481000	international people.
481000	484780	Don't get me wrong, I love the US citizens too, but hearing from the British folks that
484780	488000	call in, the Australian folks that call in, Argentina folks that call in, it's really
488000	492580	interesting to hear what gaming is like in your neck of the woods because we don't always
492580	493580	get to see that here.
493580	498940	Well, actually, yeah, I called before about it once and basically there's no official
498940	505900	gaming market here, so everything's got a market like a 360 cost $700 and a PS3 cost
505900	507200	$1,400.
507200	510420	Do you get a lot of gaming fans down there?
510420	511420	There is a lot.
511420	515720	I mean, here, there is still an arcade scene, so to speak, so we will see a lot of pump
515720	521820	it up, DDR, maybe some guitar freaks, maybe, just maybe because there's like a few machines,
521820	526140	but like the King of Fighters crowd is still there, they go to the arcades because those
526140	528460	things are still affordable, so to speak.
528460	529960	Okay, I get that.
529960	530960	That's cool.
530960	531960	Very cool.
531960	534620	And I mean, here, the PS2 is still full blown.
534620	539500	There's no next gen here yet because you can seriously go buy a backup of a PS2 game for
539500	541580	five bucks.
541580	544380	You got any questions for us tonight or anything you wanted to say?
544380	547060	Because if you don't have anything for us, we'll grill you.
547060	551100	I mean, yeah, I actually have one question.
551100	555660	What do you have to say to, I mean, as you know, after iTunes and after all these gaming
555660	560220	podcasts came out, many of us, of the listeners, actually started our own ventures into the
560220	561220	thing.
561220	565020	Myself, I don't know if you guys remember, I have my own show, The Ultimate Quest, it's
565020	567740	an RPG exclusive show, which just started out like a few months ago.
567740	568740	Good plug.
568740	573780	I mean, yeah, I'm just, I tried to mention it there.
573780	576140	But what do you say to us that actually are starting out?
576140	580940	How do you, what do you tell us, maybe a good advice or something that helps us keep at
580940	585900	it when you're like life sucks and you don't want to edit the show that day and you just
585900	588980	want to not do that thing that week?
588980	591140	What's your advice to all of us who are starting out?
591140	597660	I say the sooner you get it done, the sooner you don't have to do it again.
597660	601100	Get it out of the way, out of spite.
601100	606140	I told you, everything I do practically is motivated by spite.
606140	607140	And porn.
607140	609700	No, not so much the porn.
609700	611900	Life is things to go.
611900	616100	That's why my show kind of stopped twice.
616100	620060	Here's my advice, Footy Monster, if you're doing the show, and I'm just saying this in
620060	623620	general, I'm not saying this at you, but in general to anybody who's thinking about starting
623620	629660	a podcast doing this, if you are doing this program or if you're doing a program to try
629660	633660	and get more listeners than anyone else or try to get a listener count that's through
633660	639060	the roof or to try and get a listener base that's the biggest one you've ever seen, you're
639060	641220	doing this for the wrong reasons.
641220	645380	Yeah, I wouldn't even start if that was the reason because I used to crowd and there's
645380	646380	no listeners.
646380	649700	You have to know though, there are people out there that that is their sole motivation
649700	650700	is attention.
650700	651700	And don't get me wrong.
651700	652700	Attention is lovely.
652700	655920	I mean, the attention horse side of me is what keeps me motivated for the past five
655920	656920	years.
656920	657920	Attention can be bad sometimes.
657920	661300	Yeah, attention can be bad as we learned a couple months ago.
661300	665100	But regardless, you've got to do this because especially in these panel-based shows, you've
665100	668820	got to really like the people that you're hanging out with.
668820	671180	You know, you've really got to love the topic that you're talking about.
671180	672180	Or be able to fake it.
672180	679100	You know, and I'm sure there's been those weeks where I've wanted to come in here and
679100	684500	choke a bitch, namely Jamie.
684500	689980	But at the end of the day, I love her and she's wanted to punch me in the face on several
689980	690980	occasions.
690980	691980	Really?
691980	692980	Really?
692980	697460	Well, just like an example, you know, I came in the start of the show kind of bummed out
697460	702180	and I'm all happy now, but of course I also have alcohol down.
702180	705940	But no, for real, and I'm not saying that, you know, that's very rare that that kind
705940	709980	of thing ever happens where like, you know, I'm like, oh, I'm mad at somebody tonight
709980	713820	or I'm mad at the world and I'm going to take it out on Jamie tonight or Loki or whatever.
713820	720320	But it's like an opportunity for us to get together and just kind of like, this is kind
720320	722100	of how I hang out with Jamie.
722100	725180	And these days, I used to live with Matt, but now this is how I hang out with him.
725180	726180	You know, it's kind of through this show.
726180	727180	Yeah, you never call.
727180	728180	You never write.
728180	729180	That's not true.
729180	730180	What am I supposed to think?
730180	731180	That's not true.
731180	733800	Rob has left me.
733800	737580	To us listeners, it seems like you guys are hanging out like 24-7 because the chemistry
737580	739900	that you guys have on air, it's just amazing.
739900	742340	And it's like brothers and sisters.
742340	747180	You want to poke them in the eye just because you're annoyed at them.
747180	748180	And that's what it is.
748180	749180	Jamie's my gaming sister.
749180	750740	Matt's my gaming brother.
750740	751740	Poking in the eye.
751740	752740	I've never thought of that.
752740	753740	She has glasses, though.
753740	756660	I can't do that.
756660	758500	I have protective eyewear.
758500	759500	Roar.
759500	762220	Well, Footy Monster, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks
762220	763220	so much for calling in.
763220	764220	Appreciate it.
764220	765220	Okay?
765220	766220	All right.
766220	767220	Well, you guys keep it up.
767220	768220	And happy 5th anniversary.
768220	769220	Let's hope there's another five more.
769220	770220	Appreciate it.
770220	771220	And hey, quick question for you.
771220	773140	How long have you and the girl in your icon, who I believe was Canadian, how long have
773140	774140	you two been together now?
774140	778860	We've been together three years and a half, and I'm actually going to see her in a month.
778860	779860	So yeah, yay me.
779860	780860	Congrats to you two.
780860	784220	I just want to point out to Loki and Jamie, look at that cute little icon there.
784220	785220	They're kissing.
785220	786220	Ah, get a room.
786220	787220	Get a room.
787220	788220	Aw.
788220	789220	I can't see.
789220	790220	I can't see with your big, fat shoulder.
790220	791220	Sorry.
791220	793220	I'm just clicking away because other calls are dropping in.
793220	794220	Oh, that is cute.
794220	795220	All right.
795220	796220	There you go.
796220	797220	All right, guys.
797220	798220	Well, I'll let you guys go so you can take more calls.
798220	799220	All right.
799220	800220	We had to embarrass you on Air Footy.
800220	801220	My turn.
801220	802220	All right.
802220	803220	Take care, Footy.
803220	804220	All right.
804220	805220	Bye-bye.
805220	806220	See y'all.
806220	807220	All right.
807220	808220	You want to answer our call, Jamie?
808220	809220	Yeah.
809220	810220	Click the button.
810220	811220	I'm going to give you a good one, Jamie.
811220	812220	Hey, this is Orange Mountains Radio.
812220	813220	What the hell do you want?
813220	814220	It's Ravenstaufen.
814220	815220	Hi.
815220	816220	Hi, Dark Sakura.
816220	818220	You scared me.
818220	819220	Good.
819220	820900	What do you want?
820900	821900	What are you selling?
821900	822900	Amway?
822900	823900	Never mind.
823900	826940	My podcast, but I'm not going there because I agree with you.
826940	832620	If you're doing this for the wrong... If you're doing this for listenership, no.
832620	834620	Do it for the love.
834620	835620	Absolutely.
835620	837500	I do it for drugs.
837500	839420	You know what, Ravenstaufen?
839420	842980	You of all people are a very interesting person to be making this point, and I say this with
842980	849120	the most love in my heart here, is that you get a lot of shit, not only from this program,
849120	853780	but I know our friends over at AllGames.com constantly give you a hard time, yet you don't
853780	856000	let it faze you one bit.
856000	857000	You really don't.
857000	858700	You keep coming back.
858700	862580	It's obvious to me, despite whatever people think of you and your phone calls, you got
862580	865440	a lot of love for gaming and for this community, right?
865440	869100	I have a bunch of love for this community and video gaming.
869100	870100	I really do.
870100	871980	I've been gaming since I was three.
871980	872980	Three.
872980	873980	Amen.
873980	874980	You've got me beat.
874980	877300	I started when I was four or five, I think.
877300	878300	I don't remember.
878300	881060	Where were you when you started gaming, Darzaka?
881060	882060	Do you really want to know?
882060	883060	Yeah.
883060	887540	I think I was three when The Odyssey 2 came out.
887540	892580	The Odyssey 2, I believe, came out in 1979, which I turned three in 1979.
892580	894100	I know that dates me.
894100	900820	I turned three in 1979, so if that shows, that was my first gaming system.
900820	902340	Loki, what about you?
902340	905100	I played the ColecoVision.
905100	906100	I don't remember.
906100	908660	It's like round four.
908660	912060	My mom was playing Pac-Man when she was pregnant with me.
912060	913060	Wow.
913060	914060	So it runs in the family.
914060	915060	Pong.
915060	916060	Pong.
916060	917060	Sorry.
917060	918060	It runs in the family.
918060	919060	And pinball.
919060	920060	Very cool.
920060	921060	Wow.
921060	922060	What was your first game, Ravenstaufen?
922060	925660	Believe it or not, it was Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo.
925660	926660	Thank goodness.
926660	927660	Oh, you kids.
927660	929280	You were three when that came out?
929280	930280	I was three.
930280	931280	Oh, my God.
931280	932280	Sorry.
932280	933280	I feel old.
933280	934280	I know.
934280	935280	You just reminded me how old I am.
935280	936280	No, no.
936280	937280	No worries.
937280	938280	No worries.
938280	939280	It's all good.
939280	943500	I'm sorry I missed out on all the 8-bit action, but it's not my fault.
943500	945140	Smurfs and Bump N' Jump.
945140	948780	Dude, I hella remember Smurfs in the Atari Smurfs.
948780	951180	Our game was Mouse Trap.
951180	955180	And we had Turbo, but we had a setup for Turbo.
955180	960020	We would grab a chair and a TV tray and put the driving wheel on top of it.
960020	961880	That was where my addiction to peripherals came.
961880	963740	And Donkey Kong Jr. and Kongo Bongo.
963740	965860	Those are the other ones.
965860	966860	Good times.
966860	968260	Two more things for you, Rob.
968260	969260	Venture.
969260	970260	What was that?
970260	971260	Two more things, Rob.
971260	972260	All right.
972260	973580	I have a story for you.
973580	975180	This is down in OLR.
975180	976720	This is a serious story.
976720	980260	The first time I listened to you, I'm sorry, but I didn't like it.
980260	984500	And if I wasn't getting locked out of my house, I wouldn't have done this show again.
984500	986060	I wouldn't listen.
986060	989020	What was it you didn't like about the show, out of curiosity?
989020	991940	Believe it or not, I was a huge PSP fan.
991940	995220	The first show I heard was like, oh, Jamie was talking about her puppies.
995220	996220	Like, shit.
996220	998580	I don't want to listen to a bunch of people talk about Nintendogs.
998580	999580	I don't have puppies.
999580	1000580	No, Nintendogs.
1000580	1001580	Oh, my Nintendogs.
1001580	1002580	Yeah.
1002580	1003580	Yeah.
1003580	1004580	Remember when that game was the huge fad?
1004580	1006180	All the five seconds I played that game.
1006180	1009060	Dude, remember all the hype around Nintendogs?
1009060	1011520	It was like, seriously, and I contributed to this.
1011520	1014900	When I played the game at E3, it was one of the best things I saw at the show.
1014900	1018420	Loke, you in All Out, you bought like three copies of the game.
1018420	1019540	Why did I do that?
1019540	1022020	The game lasted five minutes.
1022020	1023980	It was like a five-minute game, and then it was over.
1023980	1024980	It was no replayability.
1024980	1026980	It's like I had to constantly take care of these things.
1026980	1027980	Fuck this.
1027980	1031180	The Rob D in chat says Nintendogs still sells a ton.
1031180	1032180	Go figure.
1032180	1033180	Wow.
1033180	1038180	Yeah, if I didn't get locked out of that door with my new wireless router, and then I listened,
1038180	1042020	and then when you mentioned Nintendogs, aw, that had me again.
1042020	1043020	Aw.
1043020	1044020	Well, okay.
1044020	1047220	I'm glad we won you back, and you've definitely brought a lot to the show.
1047220	1052300	I love you guys now, because I can tell you that I wasn't very happy at first, but with
1052300	1054740	all the love in my heart, I love you now.
1054740	1056220	Aw, we appreciate that, Ravenstau.
1056220	1057700	We love you too.
1057700	1060420	That makes me feel warm and special.
1060420	1062620	And she's confused and doesn't know how to take that.
1062620	1063620	Oh, she drinks.
1063620	1064620	One more thing, Ravenstaufen.
1064620	1066100	I had to go for the alcohol.
1066100	1067100	Let's hear it, Ravenstaufen.
1067100	1068100	One more thing.
1068100	1072580	You know, you do these live shows all the time, and I'm starting to do live and failing
1072580	1076700	at it a little bit, but how do you keep, how do you not fail at it?
1076700	1077860	Like you normally do.
1077860	1079160	You keep doing it.
1079160	1080160	We do fail at it.
1080160	1081160	You just don't notice.
1081160	1087300	Okay, this is my opinion, and this is from doing my show and this too, is that I think
1087300	1092820	I'm fucking up every episode, okay, but after a while, you know, people are like, oh, that
1092820	1093820	was fun, that was fun.
1093820	1095260	I'm like, it was?
1095260	1098700	And so you just keep doing it until enough people tell you that it's fine.
1098700	1103080	For me, and this might be a weird thing to bring up, but some people go to church every
1103080	1107700	Sunday night, and they make it a habit, and they do it every single week, and I'm not
1107700	1111860	a religious person, and really my religion is not the listener's business anyway, but
1111860	1116080	you know, this in a way is kind of that same thing, where it's church.
1116080	1117840	This is where we go every week.
1117840	1121540	We make it a point to sit here and do this, and you know, granted, some weeks we don't
1121540	1122740	make it, especially as of late.
1122740	1124340	I don't know if it's senioritis or what.
1124340	1126380	We've missed a few shows here, and I mean, we were really good.
1126380	1128260	We were like Bobby for the first hundred episodes.
1128260	1131020	I don't think we missed a single episode until like in the hundreds somewhere.
1131020	1132020	I did.
1132020	1133020	Did you?
1133020	1134020	I did too.
1134020	1136620	You missed a lot of shows.
1136620	1140940	Regardless of that, though, but one of us may be gone one week, but we can still keep
1140940	1141940	it going.
1141940	1145420	That's what we've got that Bobby doesn't have, which makes his accomplishment very, very
1145420	1147740	even more impressive, but you know, I don't know.
1147740	1151700	You just kind of think of it as this is that hobby you have every Sunday night that you
1151700	1153040	do.
1153040	1154040	But I'll tell you this.
1154040	1161620	I've been listening since you did the part A, part B thing, all of them, every single
1161620	1162620	one of them.
1162620	1163620	I really appreciate it, Ravenstaufen.
1163620	1164620	Oh, oh.
1164620	1165620	Yeah?
1165620	1167620	They want me to say this line.
1167620	1168620	Should I say it?
1168620	1169620	All right.
1169620	1170620	Go for it.
1170620	1171620	Okay.
1171620	1172620	It's an inside joke.
1172620	1173620	All right.
1173620	1174620	Thanks, Ravenstaufen.
1174620	1175620	We've got to let you go, buddy.
1175620	1176620	Bye.
1176620	1177620	Bye.
1177620	1178620	Yeah.
1178620	1179620	We've got to keep each call to like five minutes.
1179620	1180620	It's Loki's turn.
1180620	1181620	We've got a lot of calls tonight.
1181620	1182620	All right, Loki, you get to answer this call.
1182620	1183620	Let's see.
1183620	1184620	Who am I going to let you answer?
1184620	1185620	How about this one?
1185620	1186620	Hey.
1186620	1187620	Who is this?
1187620	1188620	Ah.
1188620	1189620	It's Airman.
1189620	1191620	It's a crank call.
1191620	1193620	Is somebody there?
1193620	1194620	Hello.
1194620	1196620	Frickin' crank calls.
1196620	1197620	All right.
1197620	1199620	Loki, you don't get out of it that easy.
1199620	1200620	You get another call.
1200620	1201620	Here you go, Loki.
1201620	1203620	You get this call instead.
1203620	1204620	Ah.
1204620	1206620	Loki, you get this one.
1206620	1207620	I get three calls.
1207620	1208620	Hi.
1208620	1209620	This is Orange Lunch Radio.
1209620	1210620	Who is this?
1210620	1211620	Hey.
1211620	1212620	What's up, guys?
1212620	1213620	It's TheRavdee.
1213620	1214620	Hey.
1214620	1215620	How's it going?
1215620	1216620	Yo.
1216620	1217620	Not too shabby.
1217620	1218620	Got to congratulate you on the 500th episode, obviously.
1218620	1219620	Well, thank you.
1219620	1220620	Well done.
1220620	1222620	I'm in the 500th, fifth years, whatever it is.
1222620	1223620	I'm in the...
1223620	1224620	Sorry.
1224620	1225620	Yeah, 500 would be like the 10-year.
1225620	1226620	God damn.
1226620	1231620	If we're still doing this show at 500 episodes, I want a gold watch, for God's sake.
1231620	1233620	There you go.
1233620	1237620	But I do have a question for you guys, too, relating to your fifth year.
1237620	1238620	What's up?
1238620	1239620	500th episode.
1239620	1240620	All right.
1240620	1243940	What are the most disturbing trends you've seen in gaming, and what is the best trend
1243940	1244940	you've seen in gaming?
1244940	1248620	I have an answer for this, but I'll let you guys go first, or if you want to, sometimes
1248620	1249620	think home.
1249620	1251420	The most disturbing trends in gaming?
1251420	1252420	I would have...
1252420	1253420	The baby stage of Parappa?
1253420	1256620	No, I haven't played that, so I don't know.
1256620	1265820	No, I would say probably the most disturbing trend in game is this focus on...
1265820	1270140	I guess a lot of the games seem to be repeating themselves.
1270140	1271140	Sequels.
1271140	1276460	Too many sequels, or even better, too many fucking spin-off games, like Square.
1276460	1277460	Let's see.
1277460	1278460	Perfect example.
1278460	1279460	Final Fantasy VII.
1279460	1281740	Final Fantasy VII should only be one game.
1281740	1282860	It's Final Fantasy VII.
1282860	1287860	We don't need Final Fantasy VII, A, B, C, D, E, so on.
1287860	1288860	That's annoying.
1288860	1295900	Also, this whole thing with violent video games and people targeting stuff.
1295900	1299740	I don't think video games are that much more violent than they were years ago.
1299740	1301420	It's just the technology has gotten better.
1301420	1304220	The way that they're displayed is more graphic.
1304220	1305220	Whatever.
1305220	1306220	It doesn't matter.
1306220	1309940	You've got more mainstream, and you've got people finally realizing that games aren't
1309940	1310940	just for kids.
1310940	1315260	I attribute it to society getting wimpier.
1315260	1319340	I think that people are getting more coddled and more...
1319340	1327380	For example, when we were kids, who played tetherball and who had metal jungle gems at
1327380	1328380	school?
1328380	1329380	Yeah, we had that.
1329380	1330380	Now what are they?
1330380	1331940	Plastic and no tetherball.
1331940	1332940	What the hell?
1332940	1334420	We used to play dodgeball.
1334420	1335620	Fuck this tetherball shit.
1335620	1336620	Even your kids.
1336620	1343100	Dude, we played smear the queer, which in retrospect is really bad considering how I
1343100	1346820	turned out.
1346820	1352420	With us as kids, we were raised in the, oh, well, kids got to take their bumps, right?
1352420	1356580	You're not going to learn not to fall off the swing set if you don't fall off the swing
1356580	1359940	set and want to find out that the ground is hard.
1359940	1364620	Now parents are like, oh, we need to protect them from all this, and blah, blah, blah.
1364620	1367380	Let's raise a society of wimpy asses.
1367380	1368380	You know what?
1368380	1375220	Part of being a child is learning, and that's it, is learning.
1375220	1381940	Part of growing up is finding out what is bad in the world, how it feels to fall down,
1381940	1384000	and you learn from experience.
1384000	1386900	You don't learn by just being told, oh, that's bad.
1386900	1388700	Well, you're not going to believe it.
1388700	1390820	Okay, how do you think science came about?
1390820	1394260	How do you think our modern level of technology came about?
1394260	1397620	It became because someone said, oh, I don't believe you, and tried to disprove it.
1397620	1398940	Well, that's human nature.
1398940	1399940	Wow.
1399940	1401180	That was kind of deep.
1401180	1412180	I was going to say my most disturbing trend is bad ports, Ubisoft, Wii, end of case, EA,
1412180	1416060	first generation 360 games, there you go.
1416060	1418860	Bad fucking ports is the most disturbing trend in gaming.
1418860	1420900	Most Wii games?
1420900	1423060	Best trend in gaming real quick, and we'll let Rob D give his answers.
1423060	1424060	Best trend in gaming.
1424060	1425500	Best trend in gaming.
1425500	1430180	I would say multiplayer and downloadable content.
1430180	1437500	I have to say bizarre indie games, with the exception of Irritating Stick.
1437500	1441300	I'm going to give the big three each one, because I do like that the big three each
1441300	1443020	have something going for them.
1443020	1445540	Nintendo, innovation and control style.
1445540	1448940	Say what you will about the Wii being a one-stop shop.
1448940	1452780	It's really turned a lot of people onto gaming who weren't there before, so yay, Nintendo.
1452780	1457380	Microsoft, Xbox Live, king of online gaming, undisputed champion.
1457380	1465060	Sony, hard to say so far, but home looks very innovative as well and could be very cool.
1465060	1468820	Pending on that, but certainly not the brown-eyed judgment, which also would be my runner-up
1468820	1472700	for worst trend in gaming is cameras.
1472700	1475740	It's a brilliant idea, but nobody's used it well yet.
1475740	1476740	Nobody.
1476740	1478540	Rob D, what do you think?
1478540	1482740	Well, my best trend in gaming, I'm going to have to agree with Loki and Sky on this one.
1482740	1486860	Definitely Xbox Live and the rise of online gaming on consoles.
1486860	1493460	With the online community, I've seen and taken part in the Xbox 360, it's a wonderful thing.
1493460	1495140	There's just no two ways about it.
1495140	1497500	I swear to God, I'll be there for Hold'em eventually.
1497500	1503500	I'll hold you to that, but worst trend in gaming, I actually have to kind of go the
1503500	1508340	opposite route of Dark Sakura, because I really think that a lot of publishers are being pushed
1508340	1516460	in a direction to squash some games that may or may not sell well or that people, the analysts
1516460	1519660	may think won't sell well.
1519660	1524100	On the DS, there are more independent games and there are some companies more willing
1524100	1529600	to take a chance, but when you see these development costs rising and rising so much on these next
1529600	1535420	gen systems, a lot of games don't necessarily get to be released.
1535420	1536420	That's a shame.
1536420	1543180	All right, well there you have it, so rising development costs, hmm, remember when games
1543180	1545820	were made by one dude?
1545820	1551940	Some of those Atari 2600 games were made by one dude and now they're like multi-million
1551940	1552940	dollar productions.
1552940	1557900	They don't have to be, I mean they don't really have to be to be successful games.
1557900	1562340	That's the thing, people, especially publishers and developers are kind of under this impression
1562340	1566580	that they need to really push the envelope as far as realism in games and that's not
1566580	1567940	necessarily the case.
1567940	1571940	I mean, you don't need to be realistic in order to be a good game.
1571940	1576140	Black Wolf and Chat, excellent point, Ultima was made by one dude.
1576140	1581980	Now the original Ultima is for me, excuse me, not that incredible of a game, but the
1581980	1585460	trend that it started, huge.
1585460	1586980	So anyway, Rob D...
1586980	1588780	Remember Adventure on the 2600?
1588780	1591940	Made by one guy, Warren Robinette, and then he's directed there.
1591940	1594140	Isn't that phenomenal, Adventure?
1594140	1598240	Think about how many hours you spend on a game like Adventure, just phenomenal.
1598240	1602300	Rob D., we've got to wrap it up, let some more people through, but any last thoughts?
1602300	1605780	Not really, that's all I've got for you guys, thanks for taking my call and I hope you guys
1605780	1609580	go for another, well, five years if you want to, I should say that, because...
1609580	1610580	We'll try our best.
1610580	1613280	...if you don't want to, then you've got to stop at that point.
1613280	1616460	And if you want to hear more of the Rob D., as you should, he's a great radio host, you
1616460	1621340	really do have a voice for Radio Rob D., it's amazing, tdig.allgames.com, check it out.
1621340	1622340	Exactly.
1622340	1623340	This day in gaming.
1623340	1624340	But I'm done with pimping.
1624340	1625340	Enjoy the rest of your show.
1625340	1628020	All right, have a good one, Rob D., appreciate it.
1628020	1632780	My turn to take a call, let's go, I'm going to go to a telephone call and see how that
1632780	1633780	one turns out.
1633780	1634780	Let's do this one.
1634780	1635780	Hi, you're on Orange Hawn's Radio.
1635780	1636780	Who's this?
1636780	1637780	Hey, this is Scott.
1637780	1638780	This is Yuri Lover.
1638780	1639780	Hi, Yuri Lover.
1639780	1640780	What's up, Scott?
1640780	1641780	Hey, good, how are you?
1641780	1642780	Hello!
1642780	1643780	I'm good.
1643780	1644780	Hey, Dr. Gary.
1644780	1645780	Hey, I'm lucky.
1645780	1651420	I just want to say congrats on a big five, all right?
1651420	1652420	Thank you.
1652420	1653420	You'll be starting kindergarten soon.
1653420	1654420	He's very cute.
1654420	1655420	Exactly.
1655420	1656420	We got potty trained.
1656420	1660620	We were in preschool already and now we're this many.
1660620	1661620	We're this many.
1661620	1662620	Wait.
1662620	1669500	Now, oh, all right, did Uncle touch you in the no-no area at all?
1669500	1670500	Did they?
1670500	1671500	Did he?
1671500	1672500	Did he?
1672500	1679340	No, but Loki's been kind of messing with my mind over the past couple years, so I guess
1679340	1680780	there's that.
1680780	1681780	Okay.
1681780	1684820	Talk about games for Christ's sake.
1684820	1685820	What do you want to say about games?
1685820	1686820	Well, okay.
1686820	1687820	I was going to get to that.
1687820	1700100	I was going to get to some great gaming affairs that I know of, EA and Westwood, Maxis, and
1700100	1711140	every other goddamn company bought out by EA, me and your mom last night, Microsoft
1711140	1718260	and Namco, Apple and Nintendo, and OR and GameTaps.
1718260	1720260	Why do you got a T on me?
1720260	1721260	Why?
1721260	1723780	Why do you got a T on me with GameTaps?
1723780	1724780	Wait.
1724780	1728740	Oh, well, you know, GameTaps, well, it's just a matter of time before they start buying
1728740	1732100	it, what they kind of have because they got those independent releases as well, but yeah,
1732100	1733100	very interesting.
1733100	1737180	As with a lot of corporations, you see the big gaming companies kind of merging and merging
1737180	1738580	and merging.
1738580	1739580	What do you think?
1739580	1740580	I'll pose this question.
1740580	1746340	What do you think has been a great partnership and what do you think has been a bad partnership?
1746340	1748500	Does anybody want to try and answer this one?
1748500	1750420	EA and anybody?
1750420	1752380	Has it been a bad partnership?
1752380	1753380	I don't know.
1753380	1754860	Oh, or a good partnership?
1754860	1756540	I think that's a bad partnership, yes.
1756540	1759180	I think they just ruined the Command and Conquer series.
1759180	1760180	Alright, why?
1760180	1761540	Oh, I was going to say ruin Command and Conquer?
1761540	1766980	I think the he who shall not be named and law is a bad combination.
1766980	1769060	Lord Voldemort and the study of law.
1769060	1770060	No, he who shall not be named.
1770060	1771060	No, not Voldemort.
1771060	1772060	Not Voldemort.
1772060	1773060	No.
1773060	1774060	Just...
1774060	1776780	No, I'm not going to say it on the air.
1776780	1784780	I would say a bad partnership was Nintendo and Sony.
1784780	1787220	No, that might have been a good partnership.
1787220	1791180	Oh my God, the PlayStation one on the net?
1791180	1792180	Yeah.
1792180	1794860	If you think about it though, maybe not.
1794860	1797740	Maybe that was actually a good partnership, because if that hadn't happened, maybe the
1797740	1801020	PlayStation would have never come out.
1801020	1805060	The PlayStation and PlayStation 2 certainly have changed the face of gaming, so maybe
1805060	1806640	that was actually a good partnership.
1806640	1808260	Maybe that's not fair for me to say.
1808260	1812700	How about this, bad partnership, bad, bad, bad, bad, what the fuck were you thinking
1812700	1813700	of partnership?
1813700	1817700	Phillips, CDI, and Nintendo.
1817700	1819700	There you go. Everybody can agree that was bad.
1819700	1821700	Or what was it that, um...
1821700	1824700	No, it was the CDI that was playing Sega CD games, wasn't it?
1824700	1828700	Um, no. See, I don't think the CDI ever played Sega CD games.
1828700	1831700	It was one of those offshoot ones.
1831700	1834700	Um, what about a good partnership?
1834700	1838700	I can tell you one, I think, if it ever happened.
1838700	1841700	Sega and Microsoft with the original Xbox.
1841700	1845700	Uh, how there were rumors going around that the Dreamcast was going to be on the Xbox?
1845700	1847700	Or the Dreamcast games were going to be playable?
1847700	1848700	Uh-huh.
1848700	1852700	They made it, well, in different ways.
1852700	1857700	I would have loved to have, like, guitar hero or popping music on my Xbox or something.
1857700	1860700	I would say a good partnership has been Square and Enix.
1860700	1863700	I think a lot of people had a lot to fear from that merger.
1863700	1865700	But, um, you know, the momentum hasn't really stopped.
1865700	1868700	And there's been a lot of really good games that have come out of those companies.
1868700	1873700	Uh, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest VIII, you know, we're still seeing a lot of good stuff.
1873700	1876700	Granted, Loki's problem with sequels, you know, they do have that problem.
1876700	1879700	The laser interactive, that's what it was, sorry.
1879700	1883700	Bad partnerships so far, at least.
1883700	1885700	Konami and Hudson, actually.
1885700	1890700	Because, to be honest, Hudson, everything from that division has really sucked lately.
1890700	1894700	Uh, Bomberman, you know, Act Zero, uh...
1894700	1897700	That game doesn't exist in my universe.
1897700	1900700	You know, uh, I don't know.
1900700	1906700	Hudson, I mean, they've got some good things going for them, but I know they love Bomberman.
1906700	1909700	Okay, great. But let's get past Bomberman.
1909700	1913700	Let that series take a rest for a few years, you know?
1913700	1916700	You don't need to release a new Bomberman title every fucking year.
1916700	1919700	Well, the Xbox Live Arcade one looks pretty good. I'll let them have that.
1919700	1923700	Well, hey, how about positivity? What about the good partnerships?
1923700	1924700	Square Enix.
1924700	1930700	Well, yeah. I actually, um, was going to say, um...
1930700	1933700	This is an old one, but Bleem and Sega.
1933700	1939700	Even though Sega didn't really have any authority over it, Bleemcast.
1939700	1942700	Good times. You got playing the PlayStation games on the Dreamcast?
1942700	1947700	It was only certain ones, but I was, keep in mind, I am the biggest Tekken fangirl ever,
1947700	1953700	and Tekken 3 on Bleemcast was, like, better than the arcade. It was beautiful.
1953700	1958700	I was like, hell yeah, take me now.
1958700	1964700	All right, Yuri Lever, what about you? Anything you want to add to this?
1964700	1969700	Um, not really, but I just want to say congrats again.
1969700	1977700	My parents are sort of getting pissed off right now because I'm talking on the phone to total strangers, what they think.
1977700	1979700	They don't give a stranger than Rob.
1979700	1984700	All right. Well, we're sorry, Mom, and we're sorry, Dad, and yeah, so we'll have a good one.
1984700	1987700	Oh, don't worry. It's my dad's birthday. He'll just get pissed off tomorrow.
1987700	1989700	Well, he's got a good birthday, then. Happy birthday.
1989700	1990700	All right.
1990700	1991700	Yeah.
1991700	1992700	All right, we'll see you later, Yuri Lever. Have a good one.
1992700	1993700	Wait, one more thing.
1993700	1997700	Do your parents know you're a Yuri Lever?
1997700	1999700	They don't know what it means.
1999700	2001700	Oh, I get it. Okay, never mind. One more thing, yes.
2001700	2003700	It just means that you like snow.
2003700	2006700	No, not snow. You like lilies.
2006700	2010700	Let him have his one more thing, yes.
2010700	2013700	Res trans vibrator.
2013700	2017700	Best peripheral ever, res trans vibrator.
2017700	2018700	Yeah, it is.
2018700	2019700	Until three feel comes out, yes.
2019700	2020700	All true.
2020700	2023700	All right. See you later, Yuri Lever. Thanks for the call. Have a good one.
2023700	2024700	All right.
2024700	2030700	Hey, Rob, before we take a call, I have to tell you about something that someone reminded me of in the chat room.
2030700	2031700	What's that?
2031700	2037700	I found a YouTube video of someone using the Mugen emulator to put the R-type ship into Super Mario Brothers.
2037700	2038700	That's awesome.
2038700	2040700	And played through the first level of Super Mario Brothers with the ship from R-type.
2040700	2041700	That's awesome.
2041700	2043700	Anyway, I'm going to answer this one.
2043700	2045700	Let's do some more calls. Are you going to do email bag tonight?
2045700	2047700	Yeah, I am, but I need to answer this.
2047700	2049700	Let's do some more calls. All right, we'll let you take a call here.
2049700	2052700	What?
2052700	2054700	Hi.
2054700	2056700	Hi.
2056700	2060700	I fear the Jamie. This is Junami.
2060700	2062700	I know.
2062700	2063700	Hi.
2063700	2064700	You don't sound like yourself.
2064700	2065700	How are you?
2065700	2068700	Maybe because you screamed in his ear. I don't know.
2068700	2070700	Yeah, I think that was it.
2070700	2072700	What do you want?
2072700	2075700	I'm just saying hi and happy fucking birthday.
2075700	2078700	Yeah, we're going to SacAnime, right?
2078700	2079700	Yeah, we are.
2079700	2080700	When is that again?
2080700	2084700	That is middle of July. I believe it's July 14th and 15th.
2084700	2085700	We are so there.
2085700	2086700	SacAnime.com.
2086700	2088700	You're going to cosplay with me, right?
2088700	2090700	I might if I can.
2090700	2091700	Nerds.
2091700	2092700	Fucking nerds.
2092700	2094700	Hey, Rob, you know what?
2094700	2097700	Do we ever get a panel on that?
2097700	2098700	I don't know.
2098700	2100700	Explicit was looking into it for us.
2100700	2103700	To do a panel at SacAnime.
2103700	2104700	So what do you want?
2104700	2106700	Somewhere in the basement of the Scottish Rite.
2106700	2107700	You've got to have a topic.
2107700	2108700	I'll give you a topic.
2108700	2111700	Gothic architecture is neither Gothic nor architecture.
2111700	2113700	Discuss.
2113700	2116700	I don't have any arches. I have flat feet.
2116700	2119700	Drew, you've been a longtime listener of Orange Lounge Radio.
2119700	2120700	Yeah.
2120700	2123700	Best thing that ever happened on this program?
2123700	2128700	I'd have to say episode 69.
2128700	2131700	I feel bad because Jamie wasn't there for that.
2131700	2132700	Is that the weekend I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room?
2132700	2133700	Why do you think it was the best moment?
2133700	2134700	Oh, shit.
2134700	2135700	What?
2135700	2136700	Did you hear what Drew said?
2136700	2138700	He said, why do you think it was the best one?
2138700	2141700	I know where you live.
2141700	2142700	Yes, you do.
2142700	2143700	Maybe you could give me a ride home?
2143700	2144700	Okay.
2144700	2145700	No.
2145700	2146700	That's the story behind episode 69.
2146700	2152700	Jamie was gone for a week, and our friend Janae came on the program.
2152700	2158700	And Janae was having fun with it because she thought it was a phone sex line.
2158700	2161700	And the fact that it was episode 69 didn't help any.
2161700	2167700	So it was episode 69, and that's when Karaoke Revolution, the very first one, was brand new.
2167700	2172700	And back in the day, we used to fuck off so bad on the program.
2172700	2174700	We didn't have these set topics.
2174700	2177700	I mean, every program was kind of like tonight in a way.
2177700	2179700	It was the three-hour tour.
2179700	2180700	Exactly.
2180700	2182700	And it's so weird how we've become organized since then.
2182700	2183700	Wait, wait, wait.
2183700	2184700	We're organized?
2184700	2185700	Yeah, somewhat.
2185700	2187700	When did this come about?
2187700	2189700	Karaoke Revolution got broken out.
2189700	2193700	Loki gave his most infamous performance that in some ways has scared him off from ever
2193700	2194700	doing karaoke again.
2194700	2198700	So I asked Loki, is episode 69 to blame for your fear of karaoke?
2198700	2200700	I just hate karaoke, and I don't know why I didn't.
2200700	2202700	You made me do it last time.
2202700	2204700	Karaoke hates you.
2204700	2208700	I told him he was kicked out of the apartment if you wouldn't do karaoke or something.
2208700	2210700	I don't know what I wrote it with.
2210700	2211700	I did it twice.
2211700	2214700	We're going to pick the song at random.
2214700	2215700	Great.
2215700	2220700	And then, of course, he changed the lyrics to I'm Coming Out to I'm Staying In, I Like
2220700	2221700	the Pussy, or something like that.
2221700	2224700	It was so frickin' funny, we were peeing ourselves laughing.
2224700	2225700	It wasn't that fun.
2225700	2228700	I'm sure there's a bootleg clip floating around somewhere.
2228700	2231700	That's what I need to send to Scott for the all-game soundboard.
2231700	2233700	I've got the MP3s.
2233700	2234700	Do you?
2234700	2237700	But I'm not sharing.
2237700	2242700	Alright, Drew, we had milkshakes.
2242700	2247700	I believe that was the episode that milkshake won the cage match.
2247700	2249700	I've got to run for just a minute because the food's here.
2249700	2250700	Matt, please take over, Jamie.
2250700	2251700	Food!
2251700	2253700	I know, God.
2253700	2255700	I could really use some pizza right now.
2255700	2256700	I've got pizza.
2256700	2259700	I don't give me pizza because I'm on the floor.
2259700	2260700	Haha!
2260700	2261700	Floor for you!
2261700	2262700	No pizza!
2262700	2265700	Wait, it was Loki on the floor that time.
2265700	2267700	Dude, okay.
2267700	2270700	I think that we should have the official Orange Mountains Radio BBQ.
2270700	2273700	Yeah, that would be a good idea.
2273700	2274700	At my house.
2274700	2275700	Glad I thought of it.
2275700	2277700	I am not high.
2277700	2278700	No, you're drunk.
2278700	2279700	Damn, I am not high.
2279700	2281700	I'm just me.
2281700	2282700	You're drunk.
2282700	2284700	Okay, fine, I'm drunk.
2284700	2286700	You got me.
2286700	2287700	Just because I have corrupted you.
2287700	2290700	I have good beer this time.
2290700	2291700	What do you have?
2291700	2292700	Tell me what you're drinking.
2292700	2296700	I have arrogant bastard IPA.
2296700	2298700	Not bad, however, I can do you better.
2298700	2301700	I've got Guinness in the fridge at home.
2301700	2303700	And I'm never buying cheap champagne again.
2303700	2306700	Oh my God, this stuff went right to my head.
2306700	2308700	Should I mill you some waffles?
2308700	2311700	No, damn it, I don't need waffles.
2311700	2313700	Waffles, waffles.
2313700	2315700	I paid you back your waffles, didn't I?
2315700	2316700	Yeah, a long time ago.
2316700	2318700	Okay, I forgot.
2318700	2321700	Rodney Sabrina's our pizza.
2321700	2325700	Waffles.
2325700	2328700	Dude, I could actually go for waffles instead.
2328700	2330700	I could go for pancakes right now, okay?
2330700	2333700	So, okay, tell us something relevant.
2333700	2339700	Like, talk about what do you think in the past five years of our show
2339700	2341700	you think the best game release has been?
2341700	2345700	The most innovative, game of the year type game?
2345700	2347700	Katamari Dimashti.
2347700	2348700	Why do you feel this?
2348700	2349700	No contest.
2349700	2351700	Food!
2351700	2353700	Oh my God, food.
2353700	2355700	Okay, I'm not talking to you anymore, there's food here.
2355700	2358700	I see how it is, I see where your priorities are.
2358700	2365700	Alright, anyway, what's hilarious is I took the excess furniture out of here for tonight's show,
2365700	2370700	so I put the pizza on the floor, so Jamie is scurrying to the floor to grab the food.
2370700	2372700	Watch it be the wrong pizza.
2372700	2374700	Hey, they give you coupons? They never give me coupons.
2374700	2375700	I know, I'm special.
2375700	2378700	Now everyone is on the floor for pizza, it reminds me of number 29.
2378700	2382700	Alright, Drew, we gotta let you go, because we have a bunch of other calls coming in.
2382700	2384700	Alright, later dude.
2384700	2385700	Oh no, vagina puppies!
2385700	2387700	Shut up, bye.
2387700	2389700	Objection!
2389700	2391700	What a nerd.
2391700	2393700	Alright, who's answering this call? Loki, it's your turn, right?
2393700	2394700	Yes.
2394700	2395700	Alright, then answer this one.
2398700	2400700	Hello vacuum cleaner, how's it going?
2400700	2402700	Holy shit, what's that?
2402700	2406700	I don't want to know.
2406700	2407700	That was not good.
2407700	2409700	I don't want to know what they're doing.
2409700	2413700	Whoever just called us, please give us a call back a little later,
2413700	2416700	when you've called echo 123 is what you want to call,
2416700	2419700	to always make sure that your internet connection is working.
2419700	2420700	And cleaned up.
2420700	2422700	You don't sound like a vacuum cleaner.
2422700	2424700	No problem, it happens dude, no problem.
2424700	2426700	Alright, Loki, how about you try this one instead?
2426700	2429700	Okay, hello, who is this?
2429700	2434700	Hello, this is Insanist reporting live from Duck Island.
2434700	2436700	Duck Island?
2436700	2438700	How's it going?
2438700	2442700	It's going well, congratulations on five years guys.
2442700	2444700	Thank you.
2444700	2447700	I'm going to celebrate by taking pizza.
2447700	2449700	What the crap is Duck Island?
2449700	2451700	You don't remember that?
2451700	2452700	No.
2452700	2459700	Okay, remember the show where I was absolutely on a drunken rampage in the chat room?
2459700	2462700	Oh yeah, okay, now I remember, I do.
2462700	2467700	And a certain individual, who will not be named Rob,
2467700	2473700	asked if I've ever been to Duck Island.
2473700	2476700	And I responded with, your mom goes to Duck Island,
2476700	2478700	and Rob laughed like a silly little girl.
2478700	2480700	Yeah, I know, I do that sometimes.
2480700	2482700	What do you want to talk to us about?
2482700	2488700	Well, you guys were talking about good ideas like with companies merging or working together.
2488700	2492700	You guys missed a really obvious one, harmonics and red octane.
2492700	2495700	With the whole guitar hero thing.
2495700	2500700	I mean, honestly, that's probably been one of the biggest game franchises in the past two years.
2500700	2502700	You're getting a little quieter, put your mouth closer to the microphone.
2502700	2508700	But yes, dude, you're right, it's really been one of the first partnerships to give Konami a run for its money too.
2508700	2513700	And you know what, competition in some ways is a good thing, honestly.
2513700	2515700	Yeah, is this better?
2515700	2516700	Yes, much better.
2516700	2518700	Okay.
2518700	2525700	I was just calling to say congratulations on five years, here's to five more.
2525700	2532700	I hope my show lasts five months.
2532700	2535700	Well, how long has your show been going?
2535700	2537700	Now, you're starting this new show, right?
2537700	2541700	It's going to be episode four this week.
2541700	2544700	Good job, and what do you talk about on your show?
2544700	2550700	We talk about absolutely nothing, so it's pretty much like your show was back in the day I would take it.
2550700	2553700	Good times, I'm glad somebody's picking up the slack.
2553700	2559700	Yeah, I have to because I'm the big retarded kid of Orange Lounge Radio.
2559700	2564700	All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
2564700	2568700	Not anything that would get me fired.
2568700	2570700	All right, good times.
2570700	2571700	All right, I love you guys.
2571700	2573700	I love you too, DMN.
2573700	2574700	Don't get too drunk.
2574700	2575700	We'll try.
2575700	2576700	All right, later.
2576700	2579700	All right, have a good one, DMN.
2579700	2583700	Speaking of, DMN brings up a good point I want to ask you guys about really quick.
2583700	2587700	What do you think have been some of the best guests we've ever had on Orange Lounge Radio?
2587700	2589700	Because, you know, DMN was here once.
2589700	2591700	We've had a lot of people in and out of this house.
2591700	2595700	What do you guys think were some of the best guests we've ever had on the program?
2595700	2598700	Abe Lincoln.
2598700	2601700	Me and my ego.
2601700	2605700	No, my favorite guest ever has been Sauce.
2605700	2607700	And the lesbians.
2607700	2609700	I think the lesbians have been some of the best guests we've ever had.
2609700	2611700	Sauce is the best guest.
2611700	2614700	We have a lot of good women that come on the show, nothing against the men.
2614700	2619700	I have to say the top three have been Tiara and Kristen and Megzi.
2619700	2621700	Awesome times.
2621700	2623700	We're going to go back to the phones and pick up another call.
2623700	2625700	And Warrior Bob.
2625700	2626700	He was very good.
2626700	2627700	He was very recent.
2627700	2628700	He had a very good radio voice.
2628700	2629700	He was very good.
2629700	2630700	Awesome.
2630700	2632700	All right, well, let's go to the phone lines and take another call.
2632700	2633700	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
2633700	2635700	Who's this?
2635700	2636700	Hey, this is Scott.
2636700	2637700	How are you guys doing?
2637700	2639700	Congratulations on five years.
2639700	2640700	Hi.
2640700	2642700	This is Scott from All Games.
2642700	2646700	Well, you know, I've been listening to the show and I've been hearing a lot of people
2646700	2651700	who seem to just be calling in to wishing you congratulations just to plug their podcast.
2651700	2653700	I don't really want to mention where I'm from.
2653700	2655700	I just want to make this about you.
2655700	2657700	Every call is like, hey, I do a podcast.
2657700	2660700	Hey, I want to give a shout out on my podcast.
2660700	2661700	You know what?
2661700	2666700	This is about you three and this show and it doesn't matter what I do or where I come
2666700	2667700	from, okay?
2667700	2670700	Well, I appreciate that, but isn't it funny?
2670700	2672700	Hey, there's the best guest on our show right there.
2672700	2673700	Scott.
2673700	2675700	Oh, you liked having Scott on our show at 83.
2675700	2676700	That's cool.
2676700	2679700	Yeah, because Scott dished the dirt on G4 big time on our program.
2679700	2680700	I did.
2680700	2681700	That was awesome.
2681700	2682700	True.
2682700	2684700	Not a friendly relationship there anymore, it seems.
2684700	2689700	I only got two letters from attorneys after that appearance.
2689700	2695700	So apparently, Orange Lounge Radio not only feeds information about games not released,
2695700	2699700	but it feeds information to legal counsel over at G4.
2699700	2701700	I would know nothing about that, sir.
2701700	2705700	Well, I'm asking you because we're just kind of talking about random stuff in gaming, kind
2705700	2710700	of the gaming scene is that you kind of bring up a good point that everybody and their brother
2710700	2713700	and sister have a podcast in this day and age because you're right.
2713700	2716700	A lot of people have been calling in and plugging their stuff, which is fine.
2716700	2719700	We're all about promoting the indie podcast and I know you guys at All Games are really
2719700	2725700	big on that, but what do you think can really help a podcast kind of like distinguish itself
2725700	2728700	amongst all the rest out there?
2728700	2733700	I mean, do something that no one else is doing and usually that will work when you're doing
2733700	2734700	something that you're passionate about.
2734700	2739700	I think you guys hit it on the head when you started out being about Banami because that
2739700	2740700	was what you were passionate about.
2740700	2745700	But as you got more comfortable doing your shows, you kind of showed everyone that, hey,
2745700	2749700	not only are we passionate about that, but we're passionate about a lot of other things
2749700	2754700	and that's how you kind of expand your show and you get to talk about more varied things.
2754700	2758700	But I think to start out, you got to start out with something that you're passionate
2758700	2761700	about and something that no one else is talking about.
2761700	2765700	If you happen to be into the same stuff that everybody else is into, you can still do it,
2765700	2768700	but try and come at it from a different angle.
2768700	2769700	Very good.
2769700	2770700	Do something different with it.
2770700	2771700	Good point.
2771700	2773700	You got to do something to kind of distinguish yourself amongst all the others if you want
2773700	2776700	to kind of get noticed, I suppose.
2776700	2777700	Right.
2777700	2778700	Go ahead.
2778700	2783700	Well, no, I had a couple of toasts I wanted to give to you guys.
2783700	2784700	I don't know if you want me to wait for that.
2784700	2785700	No, go for it.
2785700	2787700	I've got my champagne glass in my hand.
2787700	2788700	Go for it.
2788700	2790700	I drank all my booze already, so here's some Coke.
2790700	2791700	All right.
2791700	2792700	What's the toast?
2792700	2793700	Okay.
2793700	2795700	Do a line up with the guys back if you're doing Coke.
2795700	2796700	Okay.
2796700	2802700	Being a podcaster, I know that you guys, just like we, don't always get respect from
2802700	2806700	people in the industry, so this first toast addresses that.
2806700	2808700	Here's to the game developers we love.
2808700	2811700	Here's to the game developers who love us.
2811700	2816700	The developers we love will never love us, so fuck those developers, and here's to us.
2816700	2817700	All right.
2817700	2818700	Good call.
2818700	2819700	I like that one.
2819700	2820700	That was great.
2820700	2821700	Okay.
2821700	2823700	And then I have a little haiku, because I know how much you love haiku.
2823700	2824700	I do love haikus.
2824700	2825700	I love haikus.
2825700	2826700	Okay.
2826700	2827700	Here we go.
2827700	2831700	And I hope I don't screw this up, because usually Skye corrects my...
2831700	2834700	It's 575, Scott, 575.
2834700	2836700	Thank you.
2836700	2842700	Loki Jamie Skye, a Sunday night tradition.
2842700	2846700	Lesbians are hot.
2846700	2847700	I'll drink to that.
2847700	2848700	All right, we'll toast to that.
2848700	2849700	Lesbians are indeed hot.
2849700	2852700	I might be gay, but I love my lesbians.
2852700	2856700	I'll save my last one for right before I hang out.
2856700	2861700	Is there anything else you wanted to ask me, or can I just give you guys some more love?
2861700	2862700	I do.
2862700	2865700	Well, really, really quick, I just want to ask you a question, because I know a lot of
2865700	2870700	folks kind of know you as that guy that was on G4 a long time ago and all that stuff,
2870700	2876700	but I kind of rely on that experience that you've had kind of at the far end of this
2876700	2881700	industry, kind of where gaming media can go, kind of like all the way to the top, so to
2881700	2882700	speak.
2882700	2889700	I kind of ask, is it possible that gaming can ever substantiate that type of media again?
2889700	2893700	Will we ever have a true gaming channel in the future, in the next five years, do you
2893700	2894700	think?
2894700	2900700	I think the problem is that it's going to be difficult for anyone to sustain a channel.
2900700	2902700	It doesn't matter if it's games or anything else.
2902700	2907700	I mean, if you look at what's happening now as everything moves to the Internet, IPTV
2907700	2914700	and broadband and Fios, and if you look at game trailers and IGN and GameSpot, they're
2914700	2917700	essentially networks about games.
2917700	2921700	They're just done in a way that this, I think, audience wants to consume it.
2921700	2927700	The problem with a regular television channel is that people aren't watching regular television
2927700	2929700	anymore, especially gamers.
2929700	2930700	They're getting all their content online.
2930700	2936700	They're getting it when they want it, how they want it, and the model for reaching that
2936700	2940700	audience just may not be the traditional cable TV model.
2940700	2946700	If you notice what Spike TV and what G4 has done is they're casting their net to this
2946700	2955700	wider demographic because I think that once you try to just get gamers on a TV level,
2955700	2960700	there's a belief, not necessarily that it's true, but there's a belief by both the ad
2960700	2966700	community and the executives in television that that group, the gamer group, isn't big
2966700	2967700	enough.
2967700	2973700	You know and I know there's 150 million Americans and 800 million gamers around the world, but
2973700	2977700	I think when someone doesn't understand games and they don't know games and they don't play
2977700	2983700	games, it's difficult for them to believe that the audience is there and that it's big
2983700	2986700	enough to support a big television network.
2986700	2989700	I think the way it's going to happen is it's going to be online.
2989700	2993700	I don't think we'll ever see a traditional television network that's ad supported doing
2993700	2998700	it because I just don't think that within the age of 500 channels that there's enough.
2998700	3003700	Now, subscription maybe, like Gameplay HD and Voom, I believe that if they're committed
3003700	3009700	to keeping that channel a subscription as part of an overall, not an individual subscription,
3009700	3014700	but an overall HD package, that channel should succeed because, again, it's not reliant on
3014700	3016700	viewers and ratings.
3016700	3024700	It's reliant on the overall company, Rainbow Media and Voom, being committed to niche programming
3024700	3026700	on HD satellites.
3026700	3030700	I think Gameplay HD is the best chance for a major network.
3030700	3034700	It just actually got picked up by Cablevision, so we don't have this network.
3034700	3036700	Cablevision now carrying it as well.
3036700	3037700	Very good.
3037700	3040700	So it's Gameplay HD or it's YouTube for the rest of us?
3040700	3041700	Pretty much.
3041700	3042700	All right.
3042700	3043700	Anything else you want to share with us?
3043700	3049700	There's always all games because today audio, tomorrow video, we're working on getting our
3049700	3054700	own location and we'll be doing video every day as soon as we get that place up and running.
3054700	3059700	Of course, I'm very excited for the day that you guys all come down to our place and christen
3059700	3066700	the new location because as the ashes of Arena fall, so will a new event rise in the heart
3066700	3068700	of Hollywood with all games.
3068700	3069700	Awesome.
3069700	3070700	Wow.
3070700	3073700	You sound like you spent a couple hours writing that tagline.
3073700	3078700	I was going to say, going back to what he said earlier about G4 expanding their audience,
3078700	3082700	I always thought it was more of a polite way of saying they're actually digging through
3082700	3087700	this syndication dumpster and picking up anything they can that fills space.
3087700	3091700	It's funny seeing a station like that not so dedicated to games still getting invited
3091700	3092700	to E3.
3092700	3095700	Well, I'm sure Scott's sick of hearing about G4.
3095700	3099700	It's not even about them getting invited.
3099700	3104700	It's about them spending money to try and appease the few gaming audience members they
3104700	3106700	have left.
3106700	3108700	They basically siphoned up all the money they were spending on games.
3108700	3114700	They got it down to X-Play and a little bit of Attack of the Show and a Cinematheque ripoff
3114700	3115700	thing.
3115700	3118700	Really, it's not about E3 letting them in.
3118700	3124700	It's about G4 trying to keep those gamers because, let's face it, I know it, you know
3124700	3128700	it, the majority of people that still watch G4, even though it's a very small slice of
3128700	3131700	people in the world of cable, it's still the gamers.
3131700	3135700	Nobody is showing up for cops and cheaters and all that crap.
3135700	3138700	I don't know, I show up for cheaters.
3138700	3142700	It's all about the few remaining gamers who are holding out that maybe someday they'll
3142700	3145700	be a resurgent, but it's not going to happen.
3145700	3151700	Their E3 coverage will probably be okay because they'll have Geoff Keighley and Adam and
3151700	3153700	Morgan, but that's about it.
3153700	3155700	And then lots of women in bikinis.
3155700	3157700	There it is, because that's what gamers really want.
3157700	3160700	That's what gamers and 12-year-old boys really want.
3160700	3163700	Scott, we've got to get to some more calls.
3163700	3167700	We really appreciate you calling in and everything that you do with AllGames.com and supporting
3167700	3168700	the independent broadcast.
3168700	3171700	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3171700	3174700	Scott Siegel I want to say that, like you guys have already
3174700	3178700	laid out for people, this is not about a money-making thing.
3178700	3183700	It's not about trying to be the leader in podcasting because, let's face it, it's
3183700	3188700	a very fragmented industry and it's difficult to stand out.
3188700	3192700	The only thing that can allow you to stand out in podcasting is your passion.
3192700	3196700	When your passion shines through to the audience, they will show up, they will reward you, not
3196700	3200700	with money and riches, but they will reward you with the audience.
3200700	3204700	Your words only work if people are there to hear them.
3204700	3210700	Whether it's 15 or 500, there are clearly people that love Orange Lounge Radio and they're
3210700	3212700	the fuel that keeps it running.
3212700	3219700	It's an inspiration not only to the people that are trying to do podcasting right now
3219700	3224700	but to people like me because you are the spirit of why I started doing it in the first
3224700	3225700	place.
3225700	3227700	I close with this.
3227700	3229700	Scott, you're very opinionated.
3229700	3231700	All three of you all have your own opinions about gaming.
3231700	3235700	I love having you on our show and I love being on your show to debate, so I close with this.
3235700	3238700	Here's to you and here's to me.
3238700	3240700	Podcast friends will always be.
3240700	3242700	Shall we ever disagree?
3242700	3244700	Then fuck you all and here's to me.
3244700	3245700	Happy anniversary, guys.
3245700	3249700	Very well said, thank you so much, Scott.
3249700	3251700	Take care, buddy.
3251700	3253700	We always enjoy having Scott on the program.
3253700	3254700	He's good stuff.
3254700	3255700	Good stuff.
3255700	3256700	That was great.
3256700	3258700	You never know who you're going to hear from here on the call-ins here on Orange Lounge.
3258700	3260700	See, I really wish we lived closer to them.
3260700	3261700	I know.
3261700	3263700	It's a six-hour drive to get down there, but we're going to go.
3263700	3267700	I've heard rumblings about what they've got planned and it sounds pretty exciting.
3267700	3268700	I'm pretty excited.
3268700	3269700	More calls?
3269700	3270700	I'm still trying to work to go to E4ALL.
3270700	3271700	Why not?
3271700	3272700	Or E3.
3272700	3274700	Or I could do something.
3274700	3275700	Jamie, how about one more call?
3275700	3276700	Then you can.
3276700	3277700	Hi.
3277700	3278700	Take this call, Jamie.
3278700	3279700	Hi.
3279700	3280700	Whoever you are.
3280700	3281700	Hey.
3281700	3282700	What?
3282700	3285700	Dude, the Hulk is calling.
3285700	3286700	Hello?
3286700	3287700	What?
3287700	3288700	Hello?
3288700	3289700	Hey, it's Satan.
3289700	3290700	Cool.
3290700	3291700	Well, hi, Satan.
3291700	3292700	Hey, boss.
3292700	3293700	What's on your mind, Satan?
3293700	3294700	Guess what?
3294700	3295700	What?
3295700	3296700	What?
3296700	3297700	Your five years are up.
3297700	3302700	Your soul is mine now, bitches.
3302700	3304700	I had a full refund.
3304700	3305700	Sorry.
3305700	3307700	You know, you signed the contract.
3307700	3308700	Your soul is mine.
3308700	3312900	You'll have to talk to your secretary about that one because, you know, that Judas does
3312900	3314700	not know how to keep his paperwork straight.
3314700	3318700	Okay, don't give me any of this in-line, legally bullshit.
3318700	3320700	Your signature is on paper.
3320700	3321700	It's in blood.
3321700	3322700	Your soul is mine.
3322700	3325700	Didn't you read the small print?
3325700	3331700	Dude, I have an addendum to that that's also signed in blood that said that I can get my
3331700	3336700	soul back by certain means, and I've taken this means, so aha, welcome to the modern
3336700	3337700	era.
3337700	3340100	Satan, let's suppose you do get our souls.
3340100	3341800	And I'll have to sue you for appeals court anyway.
3341800	3344700	For the fact that we've actually managed to do this show for five years.
3344700	3347700	Satan, what exactly do you have planned for our souls?
3347700	3352700	Well, Loki, new job, my right-hand man.
3352700	3356700	I need somebody with attitude and balls who doesn't give a shit.
3356700	3357700	Good job, Loki.
3357700	3360900	Yeah, but you saw the way that Namco made him cry like a little bitch.
3360900	3363500	I mean, do you really want someone like that working for you?
3363500	3369900	Now with the power of the almighty evil that is me behind him, nothing will stand in his
3369900	3370900	way.
3370900	3371900	Not even a big ball of katamari.
3371900	3372900	All right, we got you.
3372900	3373900	And so you, Jamie.
3373900	3374900	Yes?
3374900	3385900	You will be forced to watch the series finale of SG-1 over and over and over again.
3385900	3389900	Because thank you to me, it blew balls.
3389900	3394400	But I'm Wiccan and don't believe in you.
3394400	3396900	And Richard Dean Anderson's not in it, so what are you going to do?
3396900	3398900	There's always a start for something.
3398900	3399900	End of Rob.
3399900	3400900	Uh-oh.
3400900	3402900	My dear, dear Rob.
3402900	3403900	Yes?
3403900	3404900	Guess what?
3404900	3405900	What?
3405900	3409900	Time to up the ass for you, bitch.
3409900	3413900	Wait, am I supposed to be your lover like Saddam Hussein?
3413900	3414900	I don't know about that.
3414900	3416900	I don't really want that, sir.
3416900	3421900	You know, it's just the money I can make on pay-per-view by showing somebody sticking
3421900	3423900	a pineapple up your ass.
3423900	3425900	That might hurt a bit, Satan.
3425900	3426900	I don't know about that.
3426900	3428900	I don't know if I could stomach that.
3428900	3430900	I will rake it in.
3430900	3432900	Thank you for giving this show an explicit tag, Satan.
3432900	3434900	I really appreciate that.
3434900	3437900	Hey, that's my job.
3437900	3444900	I am here to lower the moral values of all programs I come in contact with.
3444900	3445900	I forgot.
3445900	3448900	You invented all that is explicit.
3448900	3453900	Satan, you've been listening to this show, obviously, for a while, waiting for this day
3453900	3454900	to come.
3454900	3455900	What have you thought?
3455900	3456900	Hello?
3456900	3459900	What have you thought about the five years of Orange Lounge Radio?
3459900	3466900	Well, all I have to say is thank God for custom-made earplugs.
3466900	3468900	That's kind of messed up, Satan.
3468900	3470900	I mean, isn't there anything on the show you enjoy?
3470900	3474900	The pain, the pain, the pain.
3474900	3479900	U.S. Hilton is having more fun bouncing off the walls of her cell than anybody listening
3479900	3481900	to you.
3481900	3484900	You're a real jerk, Satan, and I'm about to hang up on you.
3484900	3485900	Oh, come on.
3485900	3486900	You love me.
3486900	3489900	That's why you signed the damn contract.
3489900	3491900	But you promised me Dunkin' Donuts.
3491900	3494900	Anything else, Satan, that you want to add tonight?
3494900	3499900	Let me think.
3499900	3508900	Satan, you're a real asshole, you know that?
3508900	3511900	Oh, he hung up.
3511900	3513900	Satan hung up.
3513900	3516900	Satan, you're a pig fucker.
3516900	3518900	Let's go to another call.
3518900	3519900	That was brilliant.
3519900	3521900	Loki, this one's yours.
3521900	3522900	Hello?
3522900	3524900	Who is this?
3524900	3525900	Hello?
3525900	3526900	Hello?
3526900	3530900	Who is this?
3530900	3533900	How's it going?
3533900	3534900	Hello?
3534900	3535900	Hello?
3535900	3543900	God damn, do you know how many edits I'm going to have to do on tonight's show because people
3543900	3545900	can't get their phones to work or whatever it is?
3545900	3547900	That's all right.
3547900	3548900	We forgive you.
3548900	3550900	Let's go to another call instead.
3550900	3552900	Loki, this one's yours.
3552900	3553900	Hello?
3553900	3554900	Who is this?
3554900	3556900	Hello?
3556900	3557900	It's Legend of Zaku.
3557900	3559900	How's it going, Zaku?
3559900	3560900	Oh, pretty good.
3560900	3561900	Where's Scott?
3561900	3562900	Where's Scott?
3562900	3563900	Scott?
3563900	3564900	Skye or Scott?
3564900	3565900	Scott hung up a while ago.
3565900	3567900	Skye's right here with an apple pizza.
3567900	3568900	No, Rob.
3568900	3569900	No, hi.
3569900	3570900	What did I just say?
3570900	3573900	Just congratulating you on five years, that's all.
3573900	3574900	Well, don't just congratulate me.
3574900	3575900	I didn't do this by myself.
3575900	3579900	Yeah, on everyone else, the whole RLR gang, pretty much.
3579900	3583900	Yeah, I'm just trying to wrestle, trying to get this broken monitor to work.
3583900	3590900	But yeah, a lot of things have been going on, like that whole Manhunt 2 thing, which
3590900	3594900	I don't even know why.
3594900	3602900	It's just that Rockstar, I kind of feel like they're actually pushing it too far.
3602900	3603900	I mean, I don't know.
3603900	3605900	I mean, I'm all for violence and everything, but I mean-
3605900	3607900	I'm really for violence.
3607900	3609900	Yeah, you have to draw a line somewhere.
3609900	3610900	You can't go.
3610900	3613900	You can't be that.
3613900	3614900	You can't be too violent.
3614900	3619900	Yeah, but if I want to, I mean, this country was founded on freedom of speech and freedom
3619900	3620900	of expression and freedom of art.
3620900	3622900	If I want to do it, shouldn't I be able to do it?
3622900	3628900	Yeah, but you also have to understand, you can do it, but you're going to have to face
3628900	3630900	whatever reaction comes back.
3630900	3633900	That's basically, you have to face the consequence of your own actions.
3633900	3636900	And that consequence is people thinking you're bad ass.
3636900	3642900	Like if you call somebody a racial slur, even though you have the free speech to do it,
3642900	3644900	that's not going to stop you from getting your ass kicked.
3644900	3649900	Yes, but that's different because that's when you are inflicting that upon someone else
3649900	3651900	unwillingly, and you're violating their rights.
3651900	3652900	I do not have that.
3652900	3657900	I think it's more the difference between having the legal freedom to do something and having
3657900	3659900	the moral freedom to do something.
3659900	3666900	Yeah, I guess it's kind of both are intertwined, basically, even though they have the legal
3666900	3673900	right to do it, it's just, you know, obviously Nintendo or Sony or no other carrier might
3673900	3678900	even pick that one up, maybe on PC after the whole Delta Only thing.
3678900	3686900	But yeah, I mean, Rockstar, they have to really learn how to, I don't know, just try to be
3686900	3693900	violent, but even though you have to maintain a level, you have to maintain a level of,
3693900	3698900	I can't find the right words to finish it off with.
3698900	3701900	Dude, can't we all, I mean, can't we all just get along?
3701900	3707900	Like, can't we just kind of like sit around and have some munchies and some Doritos?
3707900	3714900	But yeah, the important thing is that even though it got to go only once it's toned down
3714900	3716900	and shit, we'll sell them so crazy.
3716900	3717900	I'll tell you that.
3717900	3718900	All right.
3718900	3720900	Zaku, you've been a long time listener of the show.
3720900	3723900	I know you've been listening ever since our Bamani days when we were exclusively talking
3723900	3724900	about DDR.
3724900	3730900	What do you think has been the biggest story in the Bamani world that we've ever covered?
3730900	3735900	I'm not sure.
3735900	3745900	It's going to be the whole supernova thing.
3745900	3749900	I managed to get first dibs on it in this country.
3749900	3753900	Did I hear some water boiling or some bubbles blowing in the background there?
3753900	3760900	No, anyway, yeah, definitely supernova coming back after such a long absence of DDR extreme,
3760900	3764900	and then there was nothing, and then finally for supernova to come back kind of really
3764900	3765900	great at us all.
3765900	3768900	And of course, Loki will be the first to tell you that he was one of the first five people
3768900	3769900	in America to play it.
3769900	3770900	Right, right.
3770900	3775900	I saw you up there that day.
3775900	3780900	I mean, yeah, five years is a long time for everything to change.
3780900	3783900	People coming and going, certain things changing.
3783900	3786900	We lost a lot of people.
3786900	3789900	Remember Captain Jack?
3789900	3790900	Bless his soul.
3790900	3791900	That's right.
3791900	3793900	We've been doing this show for five years for Captain Jack.
3793900	3794900	Yes.
3794900	3798900	All right, well, Zaku, any other last thoughts for our listeners before we move on?
3798900	3799900	That's pretty much it.
3799900	3800900	All right.
3800900	3804900	Have a good one and smoke one for us, buddy.
3804900	3805900	I don't smoke.
3805900	3806900	I know.
3806900	3807900	I'm giving you a hard time.
3807900	3808900	Of course you don't.
3808900	3809900	How dare I insinuate that?
3809900	3810900	All right.
3810900	3813900	Have a good one, buddy.
3813900	3815900	I love Zaku.
3815900	3817900	Actually, I've met him.
3817900	3818900	He's a good kid in real life.
3818900	3819900	He really is.
3819900	3820900	We give him a hard time on this show sometimes.
3820900	3822900	That's because we do that to our listeners who've called in a bunch.
3822900	3823900	Let's go to another call.
3823900	3824900	Hi.
3824900	3825900	You're on Orange Lawn.
3825900	3826900	Oh, we're supposed to get to your segment, huh, Jamie?
3826900	3827900	I'm sorry.
3827900	3828900	I promise.
3828900	3829900	I have to answer the one call I've been telling you to.
3829900	3830900	Okay.
3830900	3831900	We'll get a couple.
3831900	3832900	Here we go.
3832900	3833900	Hi.
3833900	3834900	Orange Lawn's radio.
3834900	3835900	Who's this?
3835900	3836900	Hello?
3836900	3837900	Hello?
3837900	3838900	It's nobody.
3838900	3839900	Uh-oh.
3839900	3843900	Someone having microphone troubles.
3843900	3844900	Okay.
3844900	3846900	Your five years are up.
3846900	3848900	Where's the chrome hounds?
3848900	3850900	Oh, ha, ha.
3850900	3851900	Chrome hound, ha, ha.
3851900	3854900	Yeah, whatever happened to that big chrome hounds match we were supposed to have?
3854900	3855900	Who is this?
3855900	3858900	Well, we found out that the game sucked, and then I stopped playing.
3858900	3861900	Identify yourself, caller, for those that may not know.
3861900	3862900	I'm Bobby.
3862900	3863900	Hi, Bobby.
3863900	3866900	And I'm not going to say where I'm from because it's about you.
3866900	3867900	I know.
3867900	3868900	I appreciate that, Bobby.
3868900	3869900	All right.
3869900	3870900	You can say where you're from.
3870900	3871900	We don't care.
3871900	3872900	It's okay.
3872900	3873900	Back east.
3873900	3876900	So, yeah, whatever happened to the chrome hounds match?
3876900	3877900	Chrome hounds sucks or what?
3877900	3879900	It was just a horrible game.
3879900	3881900	We'd already sold it back.
3881900	3882900	We couldn't get enough people.
3882900	3884900	He was running from me.
3884900	3885900	Running?
3885900	3886900	Those things can't even run.
3886900	3888900	They just slowly move away.
3888900	3890900	You were slowly waddling away from me.
3890900	3894900	Bobby, as I understand it, you're Loki's only friend on PlayStation 3.
3894900	3897900	No, he was my only friend, and now I have, like, seven.
3897900	3898900	Oh, okay.
3898900	3899900	Oh, well, I see.
3899900	3900900	You haven't added me, have you?
3900900	3902900	You're cheating on Bobby.
3902900	3904900	No, because I don't play my PlayStation 3.
3904900	3907900	Have you guys ever actually played a game together on PlayStation 3?
3907900	3908900	No.
3908900	3909900	That's sad.
3909900	3911900	Have you guys ever played a game together on Xbox?
3911900	3912900	No, I don't think so.
3912900	3913900	You're never on Xbox.
3913900	3915900	No, we played Texas Hold'em one time, I think.
3915900	3916900	Yeah.
3916900	3918900	Yeah, I remember that.
3918900	3923900	Well, gosh, Bobby, I know you've been podcasting a long time, too, and doing your thing.
3923900	3924900	What do you think?
3924900	3927900	Five years is a long time.
3927900	3929900	A lot of stuff's happened in the game industry.
3929900	3934900	What do you think has been a real big important news story in the world of gaming that we
3934900	3938900	should take a moment to reflect on at this, our five-year mark?
3938900	3940900	It's changed the gaming world.
3940900	3947900	Yeah, I believe that the final rise of rhythm games in the U.S., something that I've been
3947900	3952900	really wanting for a long time, because I was a big fan of Bimani Games back in college
3952900	3958900	and all that stuff, and finally being able to buy them legitimately for my local game
3958900	3964900	system, is really something that I really think is a big deal to me, at least.
3964900	3971900	So, how tons of us had to import that shit for years, and now we can just get a lot of
3971900	3972900	that stuff stateside.
3972900	3977900	Yeah, and that was actually one of the things I wanted to call in to see if you guys had
3977900	3984900	seen about Rock Band, via Kotaku posts a scan of a magazine that shows the drum peripheral
3984900	3985900	for Rock Band.
3985900	3987900	Yeah, I have that magazine.
3987900	3989900	The drum peripheral, though, it's a concept drive.
3989900	3996900	It's an artist rendition, which is from their memory of when they played the prototype,
3996900	3999000	and I really hope that's not it.
3999000	4001900	Because it looks like a blatant rip-off of Drummania.
4001900	4006900	No, because it's not even shaped like real drumset.
4006900	4008900	It's like bongos.
4008900	4015700	Yeah, it's like four drums instead of five, and they're not in any kind of order or anything.
4015700	4021700	It's basically beat the pad instead of, necessarily, actual drums, because you actually play drums,
4021700	4022700	correct?
4022700	4023700	Yes.
4023700	4024700	So this is a subject near and dear to your heart.
4024700	4025700	Right.
4025700	4029940	I want a good drum peripheral for the home game, which I didn't think that Drummania
4029940	4032500	for the consoles had.
4032500	4034380	I like the arcade version of Drummania.
4034380	4038760	That was actually a Yamaha drumset that I actually considered buying myself, getting
4038760	4040700	the Yamaha DT Express 3.
4040700	4042540	It will work with it, too.
4042540	4044900	It gives you instructions in the manual how to set it up.
4044900	4046900	Yeah, but I bought a Roland one, anyway.
4046900	4050360	But I think Rockband, they were saying that they would actually work with all electronic
4050360	4055220	drumsets that use MIDI and stuff, so I won't have to worry about using this controller,
4055220	4058420	but I feel bad for anybody else who does.
4058420	4059420	I still don't know.
4059420	4060820	The jury's still out on Rockband for me.
4060820	4062060	I want to see a little more about it.
4062060	4067640	The concept sounds cool, but I'm kind of a little bit leery of spending all this money
4067640	4068640	on it.
4068640	4073100	To be honest, it looks a little too similar to Guitar Hero 3.
4073100	4078400	I know that it's developed by the same company, but it looks a little too similar.
4078400	4081540	There's going to be some trouble.
4081540	4086620	Even Guitar Hero 3 doesn't look like Guitar Hero 2, pretty much, because Harmonix didn't
4086620	4091660	give them the code, so Guitar Hero 3 is built from the ground up by Neversoft.
4091660	4096100	So I think Rockband's actually building on the Guitar Hero code base a little bit.
4096100	4097100	Very interesting.
4097100	4100340	I want to ask you real quick, because I know you're a fan of Beat Manias, you've claimed
4100340	4103980	as one of your favorite games of all time.
4103980	4107040	You kind of have me thinking about the whole Japanese-U.S. thing.
4107040	4112220	You really can't get a game like Beat Mania here in the U.S. like you can in Japan, though.
4112220	4116500	So to some, there's still a big need to import.
4116500	4123200	All the good songs are on 2DX that you have to import, so I'm still importing those, because
4123200	4128120	I'm sorry, the Britney Spears one on the U.S. Beat Mania doesn't cover it, but I do like
4128120	4131300	the U.S. controller for Beat Mania more than the Japanese home controller.
4131300	4132300	They did fix that.
4132300	4133780	They sure did.
4133780	4136580	Real quick comment in chat that I think is interesting, and I apologize to chat room.
4136580	4137580	We haven't been ignoring you.
4137580	4139460	We've just been focusing so much on the collars.
4139460	4144940	SSJ100matt in chat says, super hardcore Bomani fans refuse to give Rockband a chance and
4144940	4147260	are already judging it.
4147260	4149860	What do you think about those people that are judging the game?
4149860	4153880	Do they do that just because, I don't know, they're ignorant, or do they do that because
4153880	4154880	Guitar Hero was disappointed?
4154880	4162460	I'm sad because I think that if Konami really took a risk and released Guitar Freak's Drummania
4162460	4166140	over here, and then later on with Karaoke Revolution, we could already have something
4166140	4169100	like this, and they could be dominating the market.
4169100	4174020	But instead, they have focused on other places.
4174020	4179780	Konami's problem was that they insisted on keeping all the J-Rock and the J-Pop and all
4179780	4183980	that stuff, which is great for that segment and great for their current fans, but to get
4183980	4188220	the rest of the audience, they needed to put in songs that people here recognized, and
4188220	4189760	they never did that.
4189760	4195460	Even when Hip Hop Mania was tested in arcades, it was still all the J-Pop and all that stuff.
4195460	4200220	That's where Harmonix picked it up and said, hey, let's do this, and they put in songs
4200220	4203660	people recognized, and it became a big hit.
4203660	4205020	That's true.
4205020	4209820	One thing we've said a lot on this show that Guitar Hero has a lot to thank for its success
4209820	4212900	is the fact that they made the song list a lot smarter.
4212900	4215980	They were able to take a little more risks on it, whereas Konami was always playing it
4215980	4220660	safe and felt that the game would sell itself, which is the engine, if that makes sense.
4220660	4224300	They didn't know how they would market a guitar game over here.
4224300	4228420	That was their exact sales rep's opinion on it.
4228420	4233980	They didn't know how they would be able to market it over here, which is dumb.
4233980	4237060	People look at it and then play it.
4237060	4241860	A lot of Guitar Hero marketing is because Best Buy has it set up, and people just walk
4241860	4243020	up and try to play it.
4243020	4246500	That's most of their marketing, and a lot of people have bought it because of that.
4246500	4250140	Very similar to the Wii, I would say.
4250140	4252780	You see somebody playing it and then you're like, wow, I want to try that.
4252780	4254580	It's kind of different.
4254580	4258300	Well, Bobby, we've got to get some more calls and move on, but anything else you want to
4258300	4259940	share with our listeners?
4259940	4262260	No, it's just congrats on the five years.
4262260	4265060	I know how hard the first hundred was for me.
4265060	4268740	I do want to just share this, and I promise it will only be about a minute long, is that
4268740	4276460	I was scared to email the mailbag about two years ago when it was still the to-go edition
4276460	4277460	and stuff.
4277460	4281380	I remember it took me a couple of weeks to get the courage to even email Jamie asking
4281380	4287500	about high-definition television lag, fearing her wrath and beat mania.
4287500	4289380	I think I was nice, wasn't I?
4289380	4291860	She's nice to most of our emailers.
4291860	4295220	You were, but it was just kind of like, oh, these are the guys I've been listening to
4295220	4298660	for so long, because I had heard of you guys and I had listened before the podcast came
4298660	4299660	around and stuff.
4299660	4304620	It was kind of like the whole celebrity, oh, I don't know if I want to bother them and
4304620	4307100	stuff like that.
4307100	4311540	You guys did inspire me to do what I do, and I know you've inspired a lot of other people.
4311540	4312540	Thank you for that.
4312540	4314820	That is truly the ultimate compliment.
4314820	4316740	Compliments don't get much bigger than that, honestly.
4316740	4317740	Thank you.
4317740	4318740	I know.
4318740	4319740	It's amazing.
4319740	4325460	Thank you so much, Bobby, and we look forward to at least another 100 episodes from you
4325460	4329580	and working with you to help make those a success as well as all of the things we partner
4329580	4330580	up to do.
4330580	4332820	Thanks so much, and thanks for doing this.
4332820	4333820	Now talk about games.
4333820	4334820	All right.
4334820	4335820	We'll try.
4335820	4336820	Thanks, Bobby.
4336820	4337820	Bye.
4337820	4338820	Bye.
4338820	4339820	All right.
4339820	4341620	One more call, then we'll get to Jamie's bit, and then we'll take more calls, because we
4341620	4342820	still got some energy left in us.
4342820	4344060	We're going to do a long show tonight.
4344060	4345060	That's all right.
4345060	4346060	Hi.
4346060	4349060	Have you finally got to your call?
4349060	4350060	Yo.
4350060	4351060	What's up, everyone?
4351060	4352060	Hey.
4352060	4353060	Hi.
4353060	4354060	What's good, people?
4354060	4355060	It's Amy.
4355060	4356060	You know our call.
4356060	4357060	You know it's official.
4357060	4358060	The party cannot begin.
4358060	4359060	I'm here.
4359060	4360060	Yay.
4360060	4361060	Toga.
4361060	4362060	Toga.
4362060	4363060	Damn right.
4363060	4364060	Toga party.
4364060	4365060	Rama, you're a little bit quiet, but what's on your mind?
4365060	4366060	Oh, not much.
4366060	4367060	I'm sorry about the quietness.
4367060	4368060	My headset's being a total douchebag tonight, okay?
4368060	4369060	Fuck Logitech.
4369060	4370060	Anywho, let's get off the whole political gaming shit.
4370060	4371060	Let's get on with the show.
4371060	4372060	Let's go.
4372060	4373060	Let's go.
4373060	4374060	Let's go.
4374060	4375060	Let's go.
4375060	4376060	Let's go.
4376060	4377060	Let's go.
4377060	4379060	Let's get off the gaming shit.
4379060	4381060	Let's get onto the fun stuff straight up.
4381060	4382620	Let's get to the fun stuff here.
4382620	4386780	You know, episode 69 is definitely best episode ever.
4386780	4391540	I definitely vote on that, and you guys got to put it up on RSS people.
4391540	4392540	Keep the download.
4392540	4393540	They've got to hear.
4393540	4394540	I'm staying in.
4394540	4395540	They've got to.
4395540	4396660	Well, we'll see what we can do.
4396660	4400440	I don't know about they have to hear that, but whatever, we'll see.
4400440	4401700	I don't think it'll go in the...
4401700	4403120	You have no say in this, man.
4403120	4404820	The fans demand it.
4404820	4408460	I promise you I will send I'm Stayin' In to Scott
4408460	4411920	and let him carry out that legacy on the soundboard
4411920	4414580	to the evil glares that are coming from Loki.
4414580	4417880	And not just that, but we'll do something special
4417880	4418920	for our listeners.
4418920	4419880	I don't know about the RSS,
4419880	4421520	but for those on the LiveJournal, the MySpace,
4421520	4423080	we'll do something for you.
4423080	4424600	There you go, there you go.
4424600	4426200	That's what I'm talking about.
4426200	4429920	Now, you know, I started my own podcast,
4429920	4431880	and I have to say, you guys were the reason
4431880	4433600	why I started doing this again,
4433600	4436000	because before all of this, I used to run
4436000	4440040	my little two-hour music special
4440040	4442000	on my frickin' cable connect,
4442000	4445280	and, you know, like maybe every two weeks or whatever,
4445280	4446520	and I just stopped doing it,
4446520	4448320	and after you guys started doing it again,
4448320	4450880	I'm like, you know, I gotta get in, you know?
4450880	4453920	I started listening to other podcasts about anime.
4453920	4455260	I couldn't get into it,
4455260	4457440	so I just had a bad-mouth one of my favorite cons,
4457440	4459840	so I'm like, you know what, put up or shut up.
4459840	4461960	That's one of the reasons why I'm doing my show.
4461960	4463760	Has anybody called in tonight who doesn't have
4463760	4464600	their own podcast?
4464600	4466280	That's what I'm wondering at this point.
4466280	4467120	Probably.
4467120	4470520	I'm just messing with you, Rama, it's all good.
4470520	4474280	God, I don't even know what to ask you.
4474280	4479200	It's so difficult, because I know you outside
4479200	4481320	of this show now, which is kind of something
4481320	4482560	interesting in itself.
4482560	4484440	Like, you've kind of met all of us in person
4484440	4487760	and all that stuff, so, oh God,
4487760	4490200	what the hell do I ask you, Rama?
4490200	4491760	Look, if you gotta get a little personal,
4491760	4493640	I don't care, because I already had a drink
4493640	4494780	before I got here.
4494780	4496600	Well, I don't know, I don't want to get that personal.
4496600	4499740	I don't, I'm only your friend, Rama, that's all.
4501180	4502880	I don't know, you guys got anything for Rama?
4502880	4506280	Jamie, you've been here to talk to Rama all night?
4506280	4507440	Hi.
4507440	4508500	Hey.
4508500	4510720	Dude, I want to come to New York.
4510720	4513240	Dude, I want to come back after Cali one more time.
4513240	4514840	I'll try, maybe by the end of the year,
4514840	4516720	I'll bring a crew with me, maybe.
4516720	4518440	Cool, go have a barbecue.
4518440	4520380	Here we go, I got a question.
4520380	4522240	Okay, you guys, your little banter there
4522240	4523280	inspired a question here.
4523280	4525360	Rama, what are the differences, you think,
4525360	4527200	because you've been to both coasts now,
4527200	4528320	what do you think are the differences
4528320	4532520	between the East Coast scene and the West Coast scene,
4532520	4534200	the gaming and anime scene?
4534200	4536440	Because I know we have a lot of listeners of the show
4536440	4539160	who are deeply, who have anime as a passion as well,
4539160	4542320	and if you don't, just tune out for a couple seconds.
4542320	4543440	Rama, what would you say is the difference
4543440	4544520	between the gaming and anime scene
4544520	4546080	in the East Coast and West Coast?
4546080	4550080	Well, I can't say too much, but it used to be
4550080	4554280	the West Coast was all about the con, the cosplay,
4554280	4557160	the time you put into making that costume.
4557160	4559920	The East Coast was like, we don't give a flying fuck
4559920	4563080	if you did put 100 hours into that,
4563080	4564560	that pretty separate costume.
4564560	4567360	How much alcohol can you take Saturday night?
4567360	4568820	That's what it was always about.
4568820	4571720	West Coast, the cosplay, the East Coast was about the party.
4571720	4573880	I don't know, faname's always kind of been about
4573880	4575480	who can hold their liquor.
4575480	4578380	It's blending now, I mean, I see on the West Coast,
4578380	4581760	people over there, if West Coast was more fun,
4581760	4583920	more friendly, you know, that's what I saw.
4583920	4586320	When I had fun, I really had a great time.
4586320	4588760	I mean, a lot of props to people.
4588760	4591640	I don't see a lot of that over on the East Coast,
4591640	4592520	because half the time,
4592520	4594200	it's all about the fucking drama shit.
4594200	4596040	I mean, on the West Coast, I know there's drama,
4596040	4597480	but they keep it on the down low.
4597480	4599680	Whereas on the East Coast, all it takes
4599680	4602280	is somebody to walk past, let the drama roll begin,
4602280	4604380	you know, and it's just too much.
4604380	4606240	It depends on the clicks.
4606240	4608440	That too, and it's like, and whereas me,
4608440	4610080	I'm with multiple clicks, and it's like,
4610080	4612080	I gotta be careful who I chill with,
4612080	4615440	and I bet if I had those same clicks on the West Coast,
4615440	4616800	the drama shit wouldn't even bother.
4616800	4618240	It was like, fine, whatever.
4618240	4620040	We're all gonna have a good time.
4621000	4621840	All right.
4622960	4624000	Oh, go ahead.
4624000	4626200	As for the gaming, I would say, you know,
4626200	4628320	one thing about the West Coast,
4628320	4630900	the gamers know how to use deodorant.
4630900	4633180	That's what I can say, definitely.
4633180	4636940	I didn't really catch too much fanboy funk
4636940	4638140	this year, though.
4638140	4640860	Exactly, I mean, you go to like Otacon,
4640860	4642780	which is like the big convention, you walk in,
4642780	4644460	you're gonna get smacked in the face
4644460	4646680	with a wave of funk, seriously.
4647980	4650100	And not the good George Clinton kind, right?
4650100	4651180	Exactly.
4651180	4652020	Mm-hmm.
4653620	4655100	I think it's kind of funky in here,
4655100	4656900	because we've been, you know, smelling Rob.
4656900	4657740	Oh, shut up.
4657740	4659580	I took a shower today just for you.
4659580	4661380	Maybe someone took their sneakers off.
4661380	4662540	Sorry, I just had to run out
4662540	4663740	and check on the air situation,
4663740	4666740	because we're burning up in here, so anyway.
4666740	4668940	Rama, thanks so much for the call,
4668940	4670460	and for being a friend.
4670460	4672860	Thank you for being a friend.
4672860	4674260	Now, before I go, you know,
4674260	4676500	I have to do the same toast I did last year,
4676500	4680180	even though somebody stole it, I'm gonna do it.
4680180	4681020	Go for it.
4681020	4684020	In my hands is a can of Guinness.
4684020	4686380	I'm gonna crack it open right now.
4686380	4689460	I have the last sip of champagne left in my glass.
4689460	4691600	I have champagne in my belly.
4691600	4693500	Then I'll toast our soccer's belly.
4693500	4694340	No.
4695260	4697060	I'm Guinness at home, so I'll just do it when I get home.
4697060	4698360	Okay, take it away, Rama.
4698360	4699200	Here we go.
4699200	4700820	Here's to you, here's to me,
4700820	4702700	the best a friend will ever be.
4702700	4705940	If we ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you,
4705940	4706820	and here's to me.
4706820	4708300	I'm drinking this bitch down.
4709260	4710140	Very well said.
4710140	4712980	Oop, I actually just tried to use
4712980	4715020	the champagne glass as a microphone.
4715020	4715860	Oh, no.
4715860	4716700	Oh, no.
4716700	4717520	Oh, no.
4717520	4718360	Oh, no.
4719400	4720580	All right.
4720580	4722100	Rama, thanks so much for the call,
4722100	4722940	and take care, buddy.
4722940	4723780	No problem, I'll talk to you guys.
4723780	4725220	I'll see you guys sometime again.
4725220	4726060	It's gonna happen.
4726060	4727420	All right, later, buddy.
4727420	4728260	Peace.
4729700	4732520	Wow, okay, we got lots and lots of calls still coming in.
4732520	4735100	We're willing to go a little long tonight for this,
4735100	4736940	but we've gotta get to the mailbag,
4736940	4737780	because Darcy.
4737780	4738620	No, we don't.
4739500	4740340	Do you not wanna do mailbag tonight?
4740340	4742220	I could do mailbag, but no.
4742220	4743220	Let's do a couple emails.
4743220	4744060	Okay.
4744060	4744880	All right, because some folks,
4744880	4746620	not everybody can get in on the phone.
4746620	4748600	And I really apologize to those of you
4748600	4751180	like calling on the phone like crazy.
4751180	4752980	Some folks have been calling in seriously
4752980	4754080	since we started taking calls,
4754080	4755620	and still haven't gotten through.
4755620	4758460	We're gonna take more calls very soon, I promise.
4758460	4759900	Just, we wanna get to the email bags,
4759900	4760740	and then more calls,
4760740	4763720	and we'll hopefully get everybody that's trying to call in,
4763720	4765540	even if we have to go to the two-minute lightning round.
4765540	4766600	All right, here we go.
4766600	4767740	Mailbag time.
4767740	4778740	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com, we always welcome your emails, and Dark Shocker is gonna read them right now.
4778740	4779580	I am?
4779580	4780420	Okay.
4780420	4781700	It's you better.
4781700	4783500	First email is,
4783500	4785400	Dear O.L.R., I have one simple question.
4785400	4787900	What the hell happened to White Knight for the PS3?
4787900	4790740	Keep up the great work, your Serbian listener.
4790740	4795740	Aljosha, PS level five needs to make another Dark Cloud game.
4795820	4796900	I'm the foggiest idea.
4796900	4797940	I haven't been following that game.
4797940	4799100	Loki, you know anything about this?
4799100	4799980	This is more up your alley
4799980	4802180	with the whole title's just not come out yet.
4802180	4803060	Is it delayed?
4803060	4804940	Cancel's just kinda sleeping?
4804940	4806140	Probably sleeping.
4806140	4806960	You know what?
4806960	4807800	You know where White Knight is?
4807800	4809540	It's with Africa.
4809540	4810420	That's where White Knight went.
4810420	4812600	The White Knight went to Africa.
4812600	4813620	That's where it is.
4813620	4814820	Eh, okay.
4814820	4815660	We don't know, buddy.
4815660	4816700	Sorry, they haven't said anything.
4816700	4817540	That's the best we got.
4817540	4819500	Unless Chat Room knows something, we don't.
4820420	4822220	What does the Chat Room know that we don't?
4822220	4823580	They're just saying Africa.
4824460	4825300	Yeah.
4825300	4826120	Love it.
4826120	4827340	Yeah.
4827340	4829440	This is from Sakura Legends.
4830340	4832740	Dear OLR, birthday celebration is great.
4832740	4833820	What are you guys gonna do?
4833820	4835260	DDR celebration, getting drunk,
4835260	4837180	then having a DDR celebration?
4837180	4838020	But for all I know,
4838020	4840220	Pokemon Battle Revolution comes out tomorrow,
4840220	4844060	and that means I can play my Pokemans on the big screen.
4844060	4845540	Rob, I'll stop making hate mail.
4845540	4846980	I've decided to make more emails
4846980	4849500	begging Loki to play more Drunken Mario Kart GP.
4850700	4853140	The annoying 12-year-old who wants more Drunken Mario Kart
4853140	4855220	needs another arcade because the last one left
4855220	4857860	doesn't have DDR, but has Initial D.
4857860	4859140	But we're suing the place,
4859140	4860640	and so it isn't smart to go there.
4860640	4863580	Still youngest listener, DDR maniac, and that's all.
4863580	4865620	Wow, that's a hell of a signature.
4865620	4867620	Thank you for backing off for once.
4867620	4872420	And YouTube, we need more stuff on YouTube.
4872420	4874380	My camera does a lot of better digital stuff now,
4874380	4876700	so we need to do some craziness on YouTube.
4876700	4878840	Loki, drink, and then we'll film you.
4878840	4880220	It's funny.
4880220	4881060	Okay.
4882020	4883140	I'm sifting through the emails
4883140	4885380	because I wanna get some of them read.
4887180	4889540	One of them is Mastakilla.
4889540	4893140	Hi, I hear that Rob bought Puzzle Quest on DS.
4893140	4895300	I recently purchased the game on PSP.
4895300	4897900	The game is great, but the game freezes every second.
4897900	4899340	I'm not sure what it is.
4899340	4902340	I looked in all the forums, and I'm not the only one.
4902340	4905460	Does the glitches and freezes occur
4905460	4908420	only on the DS version you have?
4908420	4910740	Did you hear anything about a recall or patch coming soon?
4910740	4911660	PS, love the show.
4911660	4912740	Smile face.
4912740	4913580	Thank you.
4913580	4915840	I have not had a problem with freezing on the DS.
4915840	4916900	Granted, I've only played for a couple of hours.
4916900	4917740	For original Puzzle Quest?
4917740	4918580	Puzzle Quest.
4918580	4920100	Yeah, I did hear of an issue with that.
4920100	4923580	For DS or PSP, because he says he has the PSP one.
4923580	4925660	There was something with the PSP one.
4925660	4927620	Something was broken on it, I don't remember.
4927620	4928920	I read this a long time ago.
4928920	4931860	Email the manufacturer and see what kind of response you get
4931860	4933580	because lurking on the forums doesn't always help
4933580	4936380	because you get people that make shit up on forums.
4936380	4938560	Very common thing in the gaming scene in the internet.
4938560	4940300	You get too many people that make shit up.
4940300	4942780	So go email the manufacturer directly
4942780	4946020	and see if they have an official statement.
4946020	4947780	That sounds like a good idea.
4947780	4950060	Next email, shall I?
4950060	4950660	Sure.
4950660	4951700	Hey, OLR crew.
4951700	4953340	First and foremost, congratulations
4953340	4954700	on your fifth anniversary.
4954700	4957100	I hope you continue to output the same level of awesomeness
4957100	4959180	or higher in the future.
4959180	4960980	I started listening to OLR last year
4960980	4962580	after looking for Orange Lounge songs
4962580	4965380	to put on my MySpace profile, only to assemble
4965380	4968140	on the OLR MySpace page.
4968140	4971340	My first episode, funnily enough,
4971340	4973340	was the fourth anniversary episode,
4973340	4975380	which kept me busy during freshman orientation
4975380	4977380	at my college campus when I have nothing to do
4977380	4978940	and on a road trip to Reno.
4978940	4981660	On another note, something about the OLR afterbirth cage match
4981660	4983100	has been bugging me lately.
4983100	4985220	Songs that win supposedly get put in rotation
4985220	4988060	on the stream, which I've listened to while playing
4988060	4990540	Albatross 18.
4990540	4992820	Yet the only cage match winner I've heard on the stream
4992820	4995300	is Loki's Zodiac Don't Play Nice Mashup.
4995300	4997260	Are these songs actually being put in play
4997260	4999060	or am I just listening at the wrong times?
4999060	5001420	Love, GS68.
5001420	5004660	They are, but the problem is we have a 16-hour playlist
5004660	5006380	on the regular station, and it's only
5006380	5008180	going to come up once in that time.
5008180	5009980	So I think you're just, I mean, it sounds
5009980	5011820	like you've heard it once.
5011820	5014340	But yeah, the problem is, you know,
5014340	5017060	it's one song in a huge rotation of music.
5017060	5019580	So unfortunately, it doesn't always come up.
5019580	5022260	And sometimes it does go into the rotation late in the week
5022260	5025340	because I'm lazy.
5025340	5028100	But honestly, though, I have to admit,
5028100	5029980	cage match song going into rotation
5029980	5033100	is the last priority behind getting the podcast out
5033100	5035060	on time and all that, making sure all games gets
5035060	5037180	the syndicated run and all that stuff.
5037180	5038700	Last email.
5038700	5040780	Dear Orange Jones Radio, collectively known as Rob, Matt,
5040780	5042780	and Jamie, congratulations on five years
5042780	5044540	of being a festering rash on the internet.
5044540	5046340	JK, heart, heart, heart, heart.
5046340	5048300	Seriously, though, you guys are freaking awesome.
5048300	5050420	I first learned about LLR through DDR Freak Forums
5050420	5052300	because someone had a link in their signature
5052300	5053740	and decided to check it out.
5053740	5055400	Unfortunately, I was an internet noob
5055400	5056780	and had no idea what was going on,
5056780	5058440	so I just thought it was a music station.
5058440	5059820	That was three or four years ago.
5059820	5060900	Smell face.
5060900	5062580	Fall of 2005 was when I rediscovered
5062580	5065220	LLR and learned about your now deceased frowny face,
5065220	5066380	OLR To Go edition.
5066380	5068740	Isn't this for what we're doing for the whole show now?
5068740	5069660	Well, kind of.
5069660	5071500	But you know, some people liked it better
5071500	5072740	in its compact format.
5072740	5074860	But you know, we have to make decisions
5074860	5078180	based on what we think is best, and you can't please everybody.
5078180	5080980	So sorry you didn't agree.
5080980	5084020	It was an hour slash hour and a half of news,
5084020	5085900	Rob being funny, Jamie being angry,
5085900	5087060	and Matt hating on Max.
5087060	5087580	Woo hoo.
5087580	5088940	That was my freshman year.
5088940	5093940	Now I'm a junior, well, going to B1P, the tongue face.
5093940	5095780	And I've listened to every episode of LLR
5095780	5097420	since you guys started the new format.
5097420	5099580	You three are my main source of gaming information
5099580	5101260	with Kotaku filling in the blanks
5101260	5103060	and also a big source of entertainment.
5103060	5104940	I have to say that it's mildly awkward when one of you
5104940	5107660	are Rice Princess or X-A-Fur or Casper the Gay,
5107660	5110460	with an O face, or anyone else says some hilarious
5110460	5112220	and I burst into laughter in the train
5112220	5114500	and other public place, which leads to weird stares
5114500	5115420	and quiet mutterings.
5115420	5116900	That kid is crazy.
5116900	5119020	Of course, that's half the fun.
5119020	5121220	I want to get mushy, but that's too weird.
5121220	5122860	So I'll just leave it at that, and then
5122860	5124980	congratulate you guys on five years
5124980	5127300	of being some of the coolest people on the internet
5127300	5129180	and wish you luck in the next five years.
5129180	5132140	I'll make a shirt that says, I grew up with Orange Lounge.
5132140	5135660	Since yearly years, with hearts and love, heart, heart, heart,
5135660	5138100	heart, PS.
5138100	5139300	That's a cute email.
5139300	5143340	I bought Pac-Man CE, and I'm not sure why, cry cry.
5143340	5146820	PPS, shoot the whoop, charging my lasers.
5146820	5147320	What?
5147320	5148580	I don't know, but it's funny.
5148580	5150460	They just wanted you to say that on air,
5150460	5152300	so they could cut that out and have that as a sound play.
5152300	5152820	That's great.
5152820	5154580	Shoot the whoop.
5154580	5156740	I'd just go around saying, charging my lasers.
5156740	5157420	Shoot the whoop.
5157420	5158460	That was awesome.
5158460	5159860	You need to send emails like that again,
5159860	5161120	so I can send more cool stuff.
5161120	5163460	You play Pac-Man CE for the Ray-Var music.
5163460	5165460	That's why.
5165460	5166460	That's why you play it.
5166460	5166960	Yeah.
5166960	5167460	All right.
5167460	5167660	You know what?
5167660	5168740	We got a last minute one.
5168740	5169580	Should I read it?
5169580	5170620	Sure, why not?
5170620	5172460	It's someone who couldn't get a call in.
5172460	5174420	Well, we're still going to take more calls, but OK.
5174420	5175500	Go ahead and read it.
5175500	5177020	Well, this is from GS191.
5177020	5177740	OK.
5177740	5180940	Shit, I'd rather call, but my microphone ain't working.
5180940	5183020	Besides, I feel more comfortable this way.
5183020	5184220	Hey, PPLs of OLR.
5184220	5186300	Congratulation to five years of OLR.
5186300	5188620	I must admit that I feel kind of old being around
5188620	5190780	for most of those five years, going back
5190780	5192620	to the drunk episodes and the randomness that
5192620	5194260	is the three hour show.
5194260	5196420	I have so much praise for you guys, Skydark, Sakura,
5196420	5198500	and Loki, and everyone else who has made this show
5198500	5199380	for us today.
5199380	5201020	So yeah, the reason I'm writing just recently
5201020	5203260	are probably already implemented the game review site
5203260	5204900	that nobody gives two shits about.
5204900	5205620	No, not one up.
5205620	5208340	GameSpot is going to change its rating systems this week.
5208340	5210580	They state that they are going to a 0.5 base system,
5210580	5212780	no more 8.8 like scores.
5212780	5214380	And I lost my place.
5214380	5216700	And going to remove the sub score system for graphics,
5216700	5217980	game play, sound, et cetera.
5217980	5220380	They are going to add metal slash rewards
5220380	5222980	slash achievement slash e-penis points for things
5222980	5224980	like excellent graphics and sound
5224980	5227020	to blatant over-whoring of advertisements
5227020	5228540	that overall suck.
5228540	5231980	As for many listeners, including myself, we could give a shit.
5231980	5234060	But it got me thinking, why are people so fixated
5234060	5237140	with the 7 out of 10 score for an average game?
5237140	5239180	Why, whatever happened to a five being average?
5239180	5240300	Is it too low for people?
5240300	5242100	Is it too close to a three or a one?
5242100	5243760	Do fanboys have a splintered, by the way,
5243760	5246580	fanboys, to make it plural, you do not add an apostrophe.
5246580	5248860	Have a splintered baseball bat stuck up their ass?
5248860	5249660	Who the fuck knows?
5249660	5252020	I would like to ask if any of the current rating systems
5252020	5254140	work, or do they need to all be revamped and howl.
5254140	5256860	Thanks for your time, GS191.
5256860	5258260	Wow, heavy question.
5258260	5259340	It's because now people.
5259340	5261700	I read that like the biggest run-on sentence ever.
5261700	5262180	Seriously.
5262180	5264780	If you were to look at like mathematically,
5264780	5267420	yes, five would be average.
5267420	5270460	Although people are looking at it like grade scores,
5270460	5274980	which 50% would be failure, and 70% would be average.
5274980	5279140	So unfortunately, everybody's sucking that school mentality.
5279140	5282740	And that's why the rating systems all fucked up.
5282740	5285060	Because it's actually a five point system instead of 10,
5285060	5287340	because those bottom five are failures.
5290580	5293780	You know, I don't really study a lot of game reviews
5293780	5295380	on the internet, because I find I just
5295380	5296580	often don't agree with them.
5296580	5299020	I have yet to really find a reviewer that
5299020	5300780	thinks the exact same way I do.
5300780	5304660	Because everybody's kind of into different genres
5304660	5306260	and different games.
5306260	5310920	They could give a football game a 10, and I might run it.
5310920	5312580	But I'm not going to run out and buy it,
5312580	5314800	because I'm not really into sports games.
5314800	5315900	That's just not my genre.
5315900	5317860	That's not to say it's a bad game.
5317860	5319580	But at the same time, I personally
5319580	5321340	wouldn't attempt to review a Madden game,
5321340	5322980	because I have no idea what the hell I'm looking for.
5322980	5325380	I know what I like and what I don't like in a game, period.
5325380	5325940	But I don't know.
5325940	5327340	And also, you'll see a lot of times
5327340	5330580	that reviews are skewed based on what their preferences are
5330580	5331780	in gaming and stuff.
5331780	5334740	Or like, for example, I know like IGN,
5334740	5337420	you'll see a lot of these reviews that come in weeks
5337420	5338700	after the games come out.
5338700	5339620	And you can pretty much guarantee
5339620	5340860	that they're always going to be negative,
5340860	5344020	because they're holding off on playing them until later on.
5344020	5346580	And it could be stuff that's not half bad,
5346580	5348820	but they have a vendetta against certain things
5348820	5352180	like, for example, Fantastic Four or something.
5352180	5355140	They'll say, well, I don't like Fantastic Four.
5355140	5358920	So it gets a lower review, or something like that.
5358920	5361100	But this isn't what I remember from the comics.
5361100	5363380	We'll review it as a game, not as what
5363380	5364980	you remember from the comics.
5364980	5367220	Some folks in chat room are talking about X-Play.
5367220	5370300	And JV Monn says, I hate X-Play's Para Para Paradise
5370300	5370980	review.
5370980	5373500	And it just goes to show you, some people
5373500	5377120	don't get it, but there's a lot of games out there to play.
5377120	5378820	And sometimes people don't get the things
5378820	5379020	that other people are into.
5379020	5379740	Here's the thing.
5379740	5382740	They weren't actually reviewing Para Para Paradise.
5382740	5384300	They were doing a funny bit.
5384300	5385620	That's all they were doing.
5385620	5391340	I mean, really, it hasn't come over here.
5391340	5393900	It's not a game that was released in the United States.
5393900	5395540	So why were they reviewing it?
5395540	5396780	Oh, to be funny.
5396780	5398940	That's why they were doing it.
5398940	5401780	Because who doesn't like to laugh at someone playing Para
5401780	5403980	Para Paradise, because it's such a girly game,
5403980	5407020	and people like making fun of that.
5407020	5407940	All right.
5407940	5410100	Well, anything else, I guess?
5410100	5411460	No, that was last email?
5411460	5413340	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
5413340	5415460	We're running about an hour and a half into this,
5415460	5417340	but we're going to take some more calls
5417340	5418500	and keep on going.
5418500	5419340	So here we go.
5419340	5420140	Back to the phones.
5420140	5425700	1-877-GAME-OLR, or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
5425700	5428260	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
5428260	5429460	Hey, guys, can you hear me?
5429460	5430060	Yes, we can.
5430060	5431020	Who is this?
5431020	5432340	Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
5432340	5433460	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
5433460	5434740	What's on your mind?
5434740	5436140	Oh, not much.
5436140	5438380	I just really wanted to call and say,
5438380	5441740	happy to hear you guys got a 500 episode.
5441740	5442660	Congratulations.
5442660	5447340	It's actually five years, not 500, but that's all right.
5447340	5450220	I'm still blitzed from today.
5450220	5452420	Did we do a little drinking today?
5452420	5455180	No, I was in the middle of the whole parade thing.
5455180	5456700	It was nuts.
5456700	5458700	It's strange that you're not the first person
5458700	5463420	to make that 500 mistake, which is kind of strange.
5463420	5465860	OK, I don't feel so bad now.
5465860	5466900	No, it's cool.
5466900	5468340	It's all good.
5468340	5470060	Let's talk about games.
5470060	5473620	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
5473620	5475980	Mostly DS stuff.
5475980	5478780	What, are you a big fan of handhelds?
5478780	5480500	Yeah, they're easy for me to get into
5480500	5482300	and easy for me to take on the go,
5482300	5485140	since I'm constantly in one place to another place
5485140	5486780	to another place.
5486780	5489300	Here's something big that's happened in the past five years
5489300	5492020	is, remember when the DS was first announced
5492020	5494620	and a lot of people were like, that's kind of weird
5494620	5496540	that you're going to be using the touch screen.
5496540	5499980	And now the system is like monstrously successful,
5499980	5501460	the Nintendo DS.
5501460	5506060	Why do you think Nintendo has had such success with the DS?
5506060	5508660	Because they were forced to actually make games instead
5508660	5510900	of just rehashing some stuff, one.
5510900	5513900	And two, they actually took advantage
5513900	5517020	of the originality of just using touch screen,
5517020	5520260	rather than just saying, OK, here's a portable system.
5520260	5522980	Just bring some games from the other systems
5522980	5526820	and just water it down for the portables.
5526820	5528860	Anybody else in the studio care to chime in?
5528860	5531340	Because I think most of us here in studio prefer the DS
5531340	5532060	to the PSP.
5532060	5533180	Correct me if I'm wrong.
5533180	5536340	What do you think has made the DS a winner?
5536340	5537980	Because it's dedicated to games and trying
5537980	5540980	to do 50 million other things.
5540980	5542900	I actually really agree with that comment.
5542900	5544820	I think that's why the DS has been successful,
5544820	5547460	is that really the only thing you can do on it is games.
5547460	5550340	I mean, granted, now they have the Opera browser and all
5550340	5550900	that stuff.
5550900	5553140	But let's face it, all that crap was an afterthought.
5553140	5554980	It was really a game system first.
5554980	5557220	And not to knock the PSP, because I
5557220	5559580	know a lot of folks listen to this show on the PSP.
5559580	5562420	And that's actually why the PSP is pretty awesome.
5562420	5566420	Because it's like, it's the red mage of portable gaming
5566420	5567940	is what the PSP is.
5567940	5569940	It's a little bit of everything, but it's not
5569940	5571540	really strong at anything.
5571540	5573340	It's a little bit iPod.
5573340	5575340	It's a little bit web browser.
5575340	5576980	It's a little bit gaming.
5576980	5579060	It's a little bit this and that.
5579060	5582380	But it doesn't really 100% excel at any of it.
5582380	5584060	But that doesn't necessarily make it bad.
5584060	5585540	It's a red mage.
5585540	5588740	That's quite possibly the best comparison I could make.
5588740	5591820	Well, then you also get the PSP has a lot shorter battery life.
5591820	5593940	So it does a little bit of a battery life.
5593940	5594540	That's true.
5594540	5595540	But don't get me wrong.
5595540	5596340	I love my PSP.
5596340	5598240	Try playing a nomad.
5598240	5600820	And movies look so good.
5600820	5603540	Movies look so sharp on the PSP, and so do websites.
5603540	5605620	That's why I love that little screen on the PSP.
5605620	5609140	I wish the DS had something that sharp.
5609140	5610260	That I agree with.
5610260	5611500	That I agree with.
5611500	5615700	And I did play one other game that wasn't a handheld.
5615700	5617020	What's that?
5617020	5619420	Virtua Fighter V on the PS3.
5619420	5622460	Oh, now how was that?
5622460	5624740	I think I'm the only fan of the Virtua Fighter series,
5624740	5628700	because I was in love with it.
5628700	5631260	So you totally love the game?
5631260	5633020	Oh, I love the series.
5633020	5634020	Ah.
5634020	5635220	Well, you know, I don't know.
5635220	5637180	DarkSakura, weren't you a bit of a Virtua Fighter fan,
5637180	5638260	at least in the beginning?
5638260	5638780	Never.
5638780	5639820	I hate Virtua Fighter.
5639820	5640900	I thought you did like it.
5640900	5643220	No, Dan loves Virtua Fighter.
5643220	5644980	I personally thought the game was shit.
5644980	5646460	I just made you assume that, because you're
5646460	5647180	a Sega fangirl.
5647180	5649500	The only time I played any Virtua Fighter for any amount
5649500	5651080	of time was playing Virtua Fighter II
5651080	5654780	to try to knock off Kage's mask.
5654780	5657180	And people know what I'm talking about.
5657180	5659700	Yes.
5659700	5660900	And I enjoyed the fifth one.
5660900	5665660	And I actually also got to play on a high definition projector.
5665660	5667100	Ooh.
5667100	5669180	Oh, yeah.
5669180	5672300	I didn't, I couldn't even play for like five minutes
5672300	5673460	just watching it.
5673460	5674980	It was like, ha ha.
5674980	5676740	So Rob D says, I was more obsessed
5676740	5681060	with knocking off Blue Mary's shirt in Real Bout 2.
5681060	5683340	It's always the nudity with you people.
5683340	5684500	I guess I'll say this.
5684500	5686340	Have you played Xbox 360?
5686340	5687100	Never?
5687100	5688260	A few times, actually, yes.
5688260	5690020	So what do you think graphics wise?
5690020	5692140	Do you think a game like Virtua Fighter
5692140	5694940	will look as good on the 360?
5694940	5696420	I think it probably would work.
5696420	5698300	I think it would probably look too good.
5698300	5699740	My only concern about the series is
5699740	5703980	that as long as it moves just the same, just as smooth.
5703980	5706420	Because that's a game where it's a true Twitch
5706420	5709580	fest, one frame and you're dead.
5709580	5710180	Good point.
5710180	5713220	And the reason why I ask that, not that I'm dumb or anything,
5713220	5714820	because sometimes people say, well,
5714820	5718540	the PS3 has the true HD built in and all this.
5718540	5721220	I'm just kind of curious.
5721220	5722620	They kind of insinuate that it has
5722620	5724180	a graphical edge on Xbox 360.
5724180	5727740	So I'm just kind of curious if anyone ever notices it ever.
5727740	5728540	I think it would.
5728540	5731660	But I think, honestly, the best way for me, to me,
5731660	5733900	we actually get both of them side by side in a way
5733900	5736500	and see how they look.
5736500	5738900	Well, DDR dollar bill, we got to let you
5738900	5739980	go to take some more calls.
5739980	5741500	Any last minute thoughts?
5741500	5743780	Yes, I don't have a podcast.
5743780	5744420	There you go.
5744420	5746000	All right, well then nothing to plug.
5746000	5747140	So well, that's cool.
5747140	5749300	Maybe you'll start one someday.
5749300	5749820	I doubt it.
5749820	5750700	I'm too busy.
5750700	5751820	All right, well fair enough.
5751820	5753360	Well, thank you for choosing ours to listen to.
5753360	5754420	We appreciate it.
5754420	5754980	Thanks, guys.
5754980	5757260	Later.
5757260	5759420	All right, Jamie, you get this call.
5759420	5761180	This one is your turn.
5761180	5762500	Hold on, I haven't picked up yet.
5762500	5763000	Oh, OK.
5766340	5768060	Sorry, Skype's being annoying.
5768060	5770020	Hi.
5770020	5770980	Hi.
5770980	5772540	Who's this?
5772540	5773700	It's Roz.
5773700	5775540	Hi.
5775540	5776940	It's Roz.
5776940	5779620	Oh my god, hi.
5779620	5781260	Hi.
5781260	5784580	What's on your mind, Roz?
5784580	5787100	I mostly wanted to talk to Jamie.
5787100	5789020	OMG, a girl called in.
5789020	5791260	OMG, a girl, a real life girl.
5793820	5796300	What do you want to say, Jamie?
5796300	5799920	I want to say I'm so sorry for disappearing.
5799920	5802460	That's OK, I forgive you, I think.
5802460	5803340	I do it all the time.
5803340	5807340	You have to make up for it with bleached zombie butts.
5807340	5809460	I'm sorry, what are you turning our fifth anniversary
5809460	5810660	show into, you two?
5810660	5811620	It's an in-joke.
5811620	5812660	I see that.
5812660	5815220	It's on the other site that I hang out on,
5815220	5816420	Gorilla's Unofficial.
5816420	5818620	I get it.
5818620	5820780	OK, you remember when we were all in studio playing
5820780	5822820	with that word rearranger thing?
5822820	5823780	In the chat here.
5823780	5824280	Oh, yeah.
5824280	5827180	And she made one that said, Orange Lounge Radio
5827180	5829180	owns everything including bleached zombie butts.
5829180	5829580	I remember that.
5829580	5831300	It was one of those fridge magnet site things
5831300	5831800	where you could have your own stuff.
5831800	5834940	That's part of my signature on Gorilla's Unofficial.
5834940	5836260	Good times.
5836260	5837580	Yeah.
5837580	5839500	I totally stole it from Roz.
5839500	5842020	Yeah, except I disappeared from there, too.
5842020	5844580	I noticed that, too, Missy.
5844580	5846980	So you're going to hang out more, right?
5846980	5850020	Well, you've been busy with school, though, right?
5850020	5851660	Not really.
5851660	5854540	Actually, I've been busy with medical problems.
5854540	5856420	Sorry to hear that.
5856420	5857960	Oh, it's not any different from usual.
5857960	5860460	I'm pretty much used to it.
5860460	5863460	Well, you shouldn't have to be used to that, but.
5863460	5864380	It happens.
5864380	5866700	Yeah, I can sympathize.
5866700	5869100	I had my problems last year.
5869100	5870820	Oh, yeah.
5870820	5873700	I have drugs for that now.
5873700	5875300	Luckily, the video game addiction thing
5875300	5878220	didn't go through, or I might have a medical problem as well.
5878220	5879380	I've got a medical problem.
5879380	5881660	It's called Robitis, which would technically
5881660	5885500	mean inflammation of the rob.
5885500	5888540	Rob, are you inflamed?
5888540	5890620	Girl, are you trying to say I'm flaming?
5890620	5892500	I don't know what you're trying to say, girl,
5892500	5893540	but you're making me mad.
5896980	5899700	I was inflamed.
5899700	5900460	Oh, my.
5900460	5902420	Roz, before this show gets ruined anymore
5902420	5903260	with your phone call.
5903260	5903920	No, I'm kidding.
5903920	5905300	I'm totally kidding.
5905300	5907660	But this show is off the T-bed.
5907660	5912380	No, anything else you want to say to our listeners, Roz?
5912380	5914340	Hi, everyone in chat.
5914340	5918020	Everyone who's not in chat, screw you.
5918020	5920700	That's a very nice thing to say to the people on the podcast.
5920700	5921500	No, it's all good.
5921500	5923500	No, I love everyone.
5923500	5925660	For dinner.
5925660	5926300	Maybe a little.
5929780	5930420	All right, well.
5930420	5933300	Happy little anniversary, Chindig.
5933300	5938860	I thought I'd get back to the planet to join you for this.
5938860	5941940	Ground control to Major Tom.
5941940	5943100	Something like that.
5943100	5944580	Well, we appreciate you, and you're
5944580	5946020	a very down-to-earth phone call.
5946020	5947140	We really appreciate that.
5947140	5948300	Thanks for calling, Roz.
5948300	5949780	We miss you.
5949780	5950380	I know you did.
5950380	5952660	But my aim's improving.
5952660	5953620	Bye, Roz.
5953620	5954340	Take care.
5954340	5955140	Take care.
5955140	5956500	Bye-bye.
5956500	5958380	It's nice to hear from a girl.
5958380	5960060	What is that about?
5960060	5963100	How many times does the girl gamer topic come up here?
5963100	5967180	How does it feel, Dark Sakura, to be a girl in a very
5967180	5970460	manly-dominated scene, as if we don't ask this question?
5970460	5972860	Wait till I have cramps.
5972860	5974860	It all depends on my hormonal level that much.
5974860	5976700	Then we'll all be hurting.
5976700	5978180	Exactly.
5978180	5979020	Let's go to another call.
5979020	5980660	Loki, you awake?
5980660	5981980	I'm awake.
5981980	5983140	You bored?
5983140	5984140	Can I get you something?
5984140	5985220	I was playing blocks, or something.
5985220	5985500	All right.
5985500	5988140	Well, you're going to take this call, OK, Loki?
5988140	5990620	Hello, this is Orange Launch Radio.
5990620	5991140	Who is this?
5991140	5991780	Hello?
5991780	5992820	Hello.
5992820	5993980	Hello, it's Chaving Mon.
5993980	5995180	Hey, how's it going?
5995180	5996020	Hi.
5996020	5997260	You?
5997260	5998180	I actually got through.
5998180	6000380	I didn't think this would ever happen.
6000380	6001900	So my question's for Rob.
6001900	6004420	Yes, sir.
6004420	6008260	Would Flaming Finger ever work on the DS?
6008260	6011500	Only if it has a soundtrack with the quality of the
6011500	6013500	original Flaming Finger.
6013500	6015260	For those that have never played Flaming Finger, because
6015260	6017540	I have to give background now, Flaming Finger is one of those
6017540	6018260	ticket spitter games.
6018260	6020980	And I've always seen them ever in two places.
6020980	6023420	Dave and Busters, just about every Dave and Busters I've
6023420	6024900	ever walked into has one of these machines.
6024900	6028380	And randomly, Sunnyvale Golf Land had one.
6028380	6032100	And you use your finger to navigate through this maze.
6032100	6035060	And the game totally cheats, because as you get like
6035060	6037700	3-4ths of the way through the maze, the clock starts
6037700	6039340	counting down much faster.
6039340	6040740	But it's got this very distinctive
6040740	6042020	rave beat to the game.
6042020	6042940	And it is still f-
6042940	6044340	Flaming Finger.
6044340	6046740	And of course, all the homosexual jokes you can make
6046740	6049740	with it, tee hee gay, tee hee flaming, ha ha ha.
6049740	6050660	Get your flame on.
6050660	6051900	Get your flame on.
6054420	6059020	And yeah, I kind of froze up and don't know what to say.
6059020	6059540	That's it?
6059540	6060780	That's all you want to say?
6060780	6061820	You want to ask if I gave up on you?
6061820	6063580	I've been trying to get through all night, and I
6063580	6064460	finally did.
6064460	6067900	Just to ask if I enjoy Flaming Finger, or if it would come
6067900	6070540	out on the DS.
6070540	6072940	I also wanted to congratulate you guys for five years.
6072940	6075980	I remember listening to the first episode, and I was a
6075980	6077220	complete douchebag back then.
6077220	6081540	You guys actually banned me from the chat room.
6081540	6084700	We banned JV Mon from chat during the first episode.
6084700	6085420	That's amazing.
6085420	6088140	He's since proven himself.
6088140	6090120	Which rehab works.
6090120	6091940	Yeah.
6091940	6092780	Crying and mowing the lawn.
6092780	6094420	OLR rehab.
6094420	6097060	I don't know about that, but I'd also like to thank Jamie
6097060	6099620	for introducing me to Doctor Who, my new form of crack.
6099620	6103100	Yeah, I'm getting people addicted.
6103100	6105580	He's also one of the people I talk to every
6105580	6107340	day online, too, now.
6107340	6108940	Yes, Jamie's my new online BFF.
6112500	6114860	And thanks for lunch in New York City, JV Mon.
6114860	6115940	I appreciate that.
6115940	6119280	And I wasn't the one that banned you from chat, was I?
6119280	6120260	No, I think it was Jamie.
6120260	6121700	OK, well, you know she does that.
6121700	6123460	Well, I do that all the time.
6123460	6126820	With her enormous pan hammer.
6126820	6127980	It's all good.
6127980	6130500	Hey, actually, JV Mon, I want to ask you a question, because
6130500	6131660	a lot's changed in five years.
6131660	6133380	I hope you don't mind me saying on the program, but
6133380	6136260	you're the first person that's called in that I also recognize
6136260	6138420	as another gay gamer, right?
6138420	6140180	And that's where I am, too.
6140180	6141700	And even though the topic doesn't come up all the time
6141700	6146140	on this show, do you think there's been progress for us
6146140	6147620	in gaming in the past five years?
6147620	6149740	Like, you know how, especially five years ago, you sat on
6149740	6154860	the Xbox Live, it's fag, fag, fag, fag, gay, gay, that's gay.
6154860	6156900	Do you think there's been any progress?
6156900	6161660	Because I notice the visibility of the gaygamer.net and a lot
6161660	6164260	of those gay gaming communities, it seems like
6164260	6167780	there's an awful lot more people out there now that will
6167780	6169160	admit they're gay in the gaming scene than
6169160	6169780	there used to be.
6169780	6172300	I don't know if it's just me, but what do you think?
6172300	6174740	I just think that over time has passed, people have just
6174740	6177940	been more accepting about it, because they
6177940	6179060	can't hide it anymore.
6179060	6180820	It's just there and it's out there.
6180820	6182060	It's either you got with the times or you
6182060	6183140	just got left behind.
6183140	6185460	So in other words, if you've put it on your MySpace profile
6185460	6188180	somewhere, somebody's going to find it, and they know.
6188180	6188700	Very much.
6188700	6191380	If you put it on MySpace, it's on the internet.
6191380	6192940	It's like trying to get pee out of a pool.
6192940	6201980	Do you think that it might be a mirror of society, where
6201980	6205660	maybe there's been a more general acceptance of gay
6205660	6208140	lifestyle and gay culture in society?
6208140	6209460	Yeah, for sure.
6209460	6211300	I think that might have a little bit to do with it, too.
6211300	6213620	Because when I was in high school, you didn't dare tell
6213620	6215700	anybody you were gay in high school, because you'd get
6215700	6216620	killed, practically.
6216620	6218260	I mean, not necessarily killed, but just beaten half
6218260	6218820	to death.
6218820	6222740	But now in this day and age, God, I talk to my mom used to
6222740	6224020	work for the choir teacher.
6224020	6227020	And obviously, I'm not saying this about all guys, but there
6227020	6229740	are a lot of guys that join choir that have homosexual
6229740	6230380	tendencies.
6230380	6232820	And the choir teacher tells my mom that these days, the gay
6232820	6235220	guys are the most popular ones in school.
6235220	6237500	And it's because of those shows on TV, like Queer Eye,
6237500	6239300	even though it's not my kind of show.
6239300	6240580	It just kind of gives visibility.
6240580	6242020	So I don't know.
6242020	6243580	I guess we're talking about something a lot bigger than
6243580	6246140	gaming, so I should probably hang up on you now.
6246140	6246900	Only if you want.
6246900	6247500	All right.
6247500	6249420	You're the one to stop the rest of your life.
6249420	6249900	All right.
6249900	6254260	Well, take care, JVmon, and yeah, thanks for calling.
6254260	6254860	No problem.
6254860	6256620	You'll be getting CDs from me in like two weeks.
6256620	6257100	Sweet.
6257100	6258780	I love CDs.
6258780	6262140	All right, I'll let you have more important calls.
6262140	6263020	All right.
6263020	6264980	It's just more calls, JVmon.
6264980	6267020	No one call is more important than the other.
6267020	6267540	All right.
6267540	6267940	All right.
6267940	6268860	Take care.
6268860	6269380	You, too.
6269380	6270500	Bye-bye.
6270500	6274980	Now we have people in chat that are like, I'm in choir.
6274980	6275460	I'm not gay.
6275460	6277020	I didn't say all.
6277020	6278620	I just said a lot.
6278620	6282540	Not even a lot, but you have to admit that there are, I
6282540	6285660	don't know, at least when I was in high school, at least
6285660	6287580	half the guys in choir were a little bit fruity.
6287580	6289580	And I would think it's still that way, too.
6289580	6291620	I'm not saying they all are.
6291620	6292220	Back off.
6292220	6295340	God, now we're going to get emails and everything, too.
6295340	6298300	Dark soccer, weren't you in choir?
6298300	6301060	I was until they made me sing with the boys,
6301060	6303140	because I had a low voice.
6303140	6305860	Gay boys or straight boys?
6305860	6307260	This was church.
6307260	6308420	Oh, never mind.
6308420	6309020	That's different.
6309020	6310700	Well, no, I did chorus for two weeks,
6310700	6311940	but I was supposed to be in band.
6311940	6313900	That's a whole other can of worms.
6313900	6314500	Yeah, I know.
6314500	6315340	All right.
6315340	6317420	Let's go to another call.
6317420	6318820	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6318820	6319500	Who's this?
6319500	6321020	Hey, this is Black Devil or X.
6321020	6322900	Hi, Black Devil or X. You're a little bit quiet.
6322900	6324020	Make sure you're talking right in the mic.
6324020	6325020	What's on your mind?
6325020	6328260	Um, not much.
6328260	6332220	Gosh, I'm hearing a ringing in the background, but that's OK.
6332220	6332780	I hear that.
6332780	6333220	That's weird.
6333220	6333820	We hear it, too.
6333820	6334300	That's OK.
6334300	6334940	Keep trying.
6334940	6337820	What's on your mind?
6337820	6340940	I don't know if you called in last week,
6340940	6343780	or if you remember, I called in a couple of weeks ago.
6343780	6347260	I was trying to get a wee, and I finally got one.
6347260	6348340	You finally got a wee?
6348340	6351340	It sounds like someone's drinking a Slurpee over there
6351340	6352380	or something, doesn't it?
6352380	6353420	I can't figure that.
6353420	6353920	I'm sorry.
6353920	6355500	I'm playing with something else here.
6355500	6356420	I'll pop it away.
6356420	6357140	That's why we hear it.
6357140	6358860	I swear to God, it's like we hear a Slurpee
6358860	6360900	or in the background or something, or like a bong.
6360900	6361900	Are you smoking weed?
6361900	6363380	No, I am not smoking weed.
6363380	6364220	All right, OK.
6364220	6365300	Are you smoking crack?
6365300	6365800	All right.
6365800	6366300	Oh.
6366300	6367420	All right.
6367420	6368220	We're just kidding.
6368220	6370660	You don't smoke crack in a bong, nor did I.
6370660	6374420	Anyway, not that I'd know.
6374420	6376380	So you finally got a wee?
6376380	6377140	I did.
6377140	6378020	Congratulations.
6378020	6379540	How did you manage to do it?
6379540	6384620	I actually had to buy it in a bundle with two other games
6384620	6388940	and another re-remote.
6388940	6391220	And where did you get this bundle at?
6391220	6394260	I got this bundle at the Virgin Megastore.
6394260	6395620	So a forced bundle.
6395620	6397540	What do you think about forced bundles?
6397540	6399100	I don't like them.
6399100	6401020	But you bought one anyway.
6401020	6403300	I just really don't like them, especially
6403300	6406700	when the game selections suck.
6406700	6409860	Rob D says he had to buy it in a bundle with a phone that
6409860	6410740	wouldn't stop ringing.
6410740	6419220	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
6419220	6420460	What?
6420460	6422100	You probably can't hear it on your end,
6422100	6425340	but we keep hearing this little, it's like a Slurpee or a ring
6425340	6426860	or something, like every two seconds.
6426860	6427980	It's so funny.
6427980	6430660	Anyway, so are you happy now that you got a wee?
6430660	6433980	Have you actually been playing it?
6433980	6435540	Well, the two games that I had to get
6435540	6440420	were Power Ultimate Alliance and Spider-Man 3.
6440420	6440940	Very good.
6440940	6444620	And you didn't opt for Zelda or Trauma Center and that stuff?
6444620	6445580	They didn't have Zelda.
6445580	6446920	They didn't have Trauma Center.
6446920	6451540	I mean, their game selection just sucked.
6451540	6453140	They had Cooking Mama.
6453140	6455300	Well, Cooking Mama's a little bit better on the DS
6455300	6459140	than it is on the Wii, to be honest.
6459140	6462220	OK, so the main thing I wanted to do tonight
6462220	6464980	while I was calling in was back when I was listening,
6464980	6467220	I think a couple of years ago before I had kind of the Sunday
6467220	6470740	night commitment, and I dropped out and I'm sorry,
6470740	6476420	was to open a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.
6476420	6481500	And here I am opening a pint of chocolate cookie dough ice
6481500	6482500	cream.
6482500	6484660	In your honor, this is like my little toast.
6484660	6485700	Here we go.
6485700	6486700	All right, five beers.
6486700	6489220	Here, I'm clanking my empty champagne glass
6489220	6491140	to your cookie dough ice cream.
6491140	6492220	There you go.
6492220	6495660	My stomach is digesting in honor of your ice cream.
6495660	6497060	All right.
6497060	6498220	We got to let you go, buddy.
6498220	6499660	That ringing is driving me nuts.
6499660	6501780	But thank you very much for the call.
6501780	6503620	And listen to the playback on the podcast,
6503620	6504740	because it's hilarious.
6504740	6506300	Banana phone.
6506300	6506800	Bye.
6506800	6507300	Bye.
6511900	6513300	Jamie.
6513300	6515980	Oh, well, all of a sudden, all the calls disappeared.
6515980	6517100	Oh, here they come again.
6517100	6517600	Oh, good.
6517600	6518100	Oh, damn.
6518100	6518600	I mean, hi.
6518600	6522100	Dark Sakura, here you go.
6522100	6523500	Hey, this is Jonathan Fields.
6523500	6524260	How you doing?
6524260	6525140	Hi.
6525140	6526420	Who?
6526420	6527300	John Fields.
6527300	6528380	Oh, hi.
6528380	6530340	You were on the show like a long-ass time ago.
6530340	6533020	He's the guy that flew out here like all the way from,
6533020	6534780	like, what, Connecticut you're at?
6534780	6535740	Yeah, Connecticut.
6535740	6537420	I'm in New Jersey now.
6537420	6539980	But I was there back when Tech TV was still around.
6539980	6540860	I remember that.
6540860	6542380	I remember you came to the show.
6542380	6544340	Do you remember what episode number that was?
6544340	6546580	I don't remember off the top of my head,
6546580	6552540	but it was like the year before G4 bought him out.
6552540	6554900	OK, so it was probably in the low 100s, right,
6554900	6556380	about the time you were there?
6556380	6558060	Maybe 469.
6558060	6559020	I'm trying to remember.
6559020	6559520	Wow.
6559520	6561900	OK, but you came to the show a long time ago.
6561900	6564020	And yeah, you toured Tech TV.
6564020	6566220	I remember, because that was one of the big things
6566220	6567700	we were talking to you about on that show.
6567700	6569260	I remember you, and I remember the show.
6569260	6571560	And I remember we were talking about the whole Tech TV.
6571560	6574420	So goddamn, a lot's changed since then, huh?
6574420	6575380	I know.
6575380	6576460	Everything's changed.
6576460	6578020	I mean, your format has changed.
6578020	6583300	I mean, Magus has changed his name, all that sort of stuff.
6583300	6585740	And to be totally honest, you guys
6585740	6589140	are lucky that the anniversary is happening today,
6589140	6590060	and not yesterday.
6590060	6592140	Because otherwise, you'd be facing against a big hedge
6592140	6593300	hard.
6593300	6595300	Wait, what's yesterday?
6595300	6597620	Sonic's birthday.
6597620	6601220	Well, you know, technically, the show started on June 23rd.
6601220	6603940	So yesterday was our birthday, but we celebrate it tonight
6603940	6605620	because it's Sunday.
6605620	6607380	Exactly.
6607380	6609940	So there you go.
6609940	6613180	I was wondering, actually, Rob, did you ever
6613180	6616140	watch any of the big gaming cartoons way,
6616140	6617340	way back in the 80s?
6617340	6620620	I watched the Super Mario Brothers Super Show religiously
6620620	6622980	every day after school, and would also
6622980	6624820	watch the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.
6624820	6625660	That was my show.
6625660	6628160	I didn't really watch Captain Anne or any of the other ones,
6628160	6629980	but that was the one.
6629980	6631780	Did you know that the stuff is on DVD now?
6631780	6633540	Yes, I have the second season on DVD.
6633540	6635400	I need to find the first.
6635400	6637020	You could probably find it on Amazon.
6637020	6638780	I really need to get the Zelda DVD, too.
6638780	6640100	For some reason, I just never bought it.
6640100	6641980	I've been busy watching all these other shows,
6641980	6644620	but I definitely want the Zelda DVD package as well.
6644620	6646980	I keep seeing that one every time I go on Amazon,
6646980	6649340	so they keep recommending it to me.
6649340	6652700	So you can probably find it easy.
6652700	6654900	You kind of brought up the whole tech TV thing,
6654900	6657940	and you've been talking a lot about television.
6657940	6660820	I'm kind of curious because it's funny, a lot has changed there.
6660820	6663180	Tell us really quick again, what would you say some
6663180	6666620	of your experiences at the tech TV studios when you went?
6666620	6668300	What kind of stuff did you observe?
6668300	6671140	Do people seem to be enjoying themselves?
6671140	6673860	How was the tour when you went?
6673860	6677420	Well, basically what it was like was I basically
6677420	6682980	went into the headquarters where the main shows were developed there.
6682980	6686220	I got to meet Adam Sessler.
6686220	6689660	I pretty much walked around where everybody's office space was,
6689660	6693540	and I've still got a few tech TV schwag stuff.
6693540	6694740	That's pretty rad.
6694740	6696660	Those are collector's things now.
6696660	6697340	I know.
6697340	6702100	And then after that, I took a little shuttle over to the studio,
6702100	6707180	and I sat in on an episode of The Screensavers.
6707180	6709860	Wow, that's great.
6709860	6710380	That's cool.
6710380	6713220	And it's kind of sad now that that show's gone.
6713220	6716260	My dad loved The Screensavers too, and it was a really great show.
6716260	6719100	It's just kind of sad to see what happened in the end, all that stuff.
6719100	6722300	But Leo and the gang, they're also around.
6722300	6725700	They're just doing a show now called This Week in Tech.
6725700	6726820	Oh, yeah.
6726820	6729740	If you're in the podcasting biz, you know This Week in Tech.
6729740	6732620	It's huge.
6732620	6733620	It's a huge show.
6733620	6736780	Leo also has a KFI show in California.
6736780	6740060	I'm glad to see he's still kicking, because folks like him
6740060	6742620	are the kind of folks that inspire us.
6742620	6743140	I know.
6743140	6747020	And if G4 hadn't bought out tech TV, I'd probably be working there now.
6747020	6749420	I know, it's kind of weird, because I kind of start to think,
6749420	6751500	wow, tech TV was just right over in San Francisco.
6751500	6752900	We all know which building.
6752900	6756020	We go to San Francisco at least once a month, if not more.
6756020	6756780	I don't know.
6756780	6757860	But it's kind of weird.
6757860	6760020	It's like I feel like I would have toured the building by now,
6760020	6762380	and who knows what could have happened.
6762380	6763900	This is weird.
6763900	6766220	All right, well, hey, thanks so much for the call.
6766220	6769100	And anything else you want to say to the listeners tonight?
6769100	6771500	Happy fifth anniversary, and a happy 5-4.
6771500	6773660	And it's so good to hear from call, because I
6773660	6774860	know you haven't been listening.
6774860	6776900	At least you haven't been in chat for a long time.
6776900	6780380	It's really refreshing tonight to hear from folks blast from the past
6780380	6780860	as well.
6780860	6782180	So thank you so much for listening tonight.
6782180	6783500	Yeah, I've tried to catch them.
6783500	6785700	I just keep forgetting to catch it on Saturday.
6785700	6787060	But I'm glad I caught it tonight.
6787060	6787780	It's all good.
6787780	6789660	We know that things change.
6789660	6791260	So have a good one, buddy.
6791260	6791900	Yeah, you too.
6791900	6792400	Bye-bye.
6796020	6797180	We've hit the two-hour mark.
6797180	6799060	But of course, that counts the bonus segment,
6799060	6802260	which was a good 10 minutes long, which the podcasters don't get to hear.
6802260	6804340	So we're going to take a few more calls?
6804340	6805020	A few more?
6805020	6805580	OK.
6805580	6806300	All right, let's keep going.
6806300	6807540	Are you guys OK on time and everything?
6807540	6808860	Is anybody trying to get a pumpkin?
6808860	6809900	Yeah, I've only got to work overtime.
6809900	6810460	Oh, I'm sorry.
6810460	6810740	No, it's OK.
6810740	6811180	It's cool.
6811180	6811940	I'm joking.
6811940	6813060	Tonight's a special night.
6813060	6815780	All right, Loki, your call.
6815780	6818960	Hello, who is this?
6818960	6819460	Hello.
6819460	6820300	Hello.
6820300	6822700	This is Dr. Patzco City.
6822700	6824220	How's it going?
6824220	6826060	Ah, just great.
6826060	6828140	Hooray, more international listeners.
6828140	6829900	We love hearing from the international folks.
6829900	6834140	Let you know that I just love the show the last, Journey to Health.
6834140	6835540	Well, we really appreciate that.
6835540	6838380	Thank you very much for listening to us for the past year and a half.
6838380	6840660	Any highlights from our show?
6840660	6844820	Actually, what I do have is a question.
6844820	6847180	Oh, what's that?
6847180	6848540	What's with the name?
6848540	6852940	I assume you did have an orange lounge.
6852940	6854380	No.
6854380	6855500	Where did that come from?
6855500	6858620	You know what, very famous question we often get asked a lot,
6858620	6861780	especially since we've started getting more listeners since we
6861780	6863740	moved into the general gaming chat.
6863740	6866260	Because anybody that played the Monty games probably
6866260	6867980	knows where the name comes from.
6867980	6871500	But Jamie, I'll let you take this one because you helped come up
6871500	6872540	with the name.
6872540	6875460	Oh, yeah, where we got our name from.
6875460	6880300	We were like on the train coming into San Francisco for something
6880300	6881060	or the other.
6881060	6883260	We were going to the Metreon that day, right?
6883260	6887560	And we had been trying to think of all day a name for the station.
6887560	6891380	And when we came back, I was like, we should call it Orange Lounge Radio
6891380	6894940	because it's Orange Lounge music.
6894940	6897900	I seem to remember suggesting that we should name it
6897900	6899220	after something Bamani related.
6899220	6900300	After one of the groups.
6900300	6904860	Like a Beatles tribute band would be named Yellow Submarine or something
6904860	6905900	like that, right?
6905900	6909260	So Orange Lounge is actually a band that's in Bamani.
6909260	6911060	And they do some of the songs.
6911060	6915340	Their most famous song is probably Mobo Moga from BeatMania 2DX6 style.
6915340	6919700	And it's actually, you kind of hear the song remixed in our podcast
6919700	6921940	as incidental music.
6921940	6924860	And we're very thankful to Konami for not suing us for using the name.
6924860	6927540	But I think they realized we gave them free advertising
6927540	6929260	and still continue to do so for a long time.
6929260	6932260	So an Orange Lounge radio is different from Orange Lounge.
6932260	6933820	So there you go.
6933820	6937700	Well, that just goes to show you that I have absolutely not
6937700	6939380	a care for music games.
6939380	6940460	It's all good.
6940460	6941660	Some of our listeners don't.
6941660	6942780	And that's just fine.
6942780	6949620	So we try to, we, sorry, Jamie was showing me a private message.
6949620	6950300	Don't do that.
6950300	6952180	You distract me during the show.
6952180	6955740	Yeah, but it just goes to show we love the fact
6955740	6958700	that since we have done the merge, even though not everybody was supportive
6958700	6960860	when we kind of did away with talking about Bamani,
6960860	6962620	only talking about general gaming, I really
6962620	6965540	love that we've kind of opened it up to a whole new audience as well.
6965540	6968740	And it's not just about the music games.
6968740	6970100	OK, then.
6970100	6972740	Probably I'll give you a call the next time I get to Santa Cruz.
6972740	6974340	I have a present for you guys.
6974340	6975100	Ah, sweet.
6975100	6975620	Thank you.
6975620	6976500	And I love Santa Cruz.
6976500	6977940	I love the boardwalk there.
6977940	6979380	We'll have to go to the arcades.
6979380	6979940	Awesome.
6979940	6980820	I love the arcades.
6980820	6981620	They are awesome.
6981620	6983140	They have Discs of Tron.
6983140	6983740	Sweet.
6983740	6984380	They do.
6984380	6985260	That they do.
6985260	6985580	All right.
6985580	6986660	Well, thank you very much for your call.
6986660	6987900	We appreciate it, buddy.
6987900	6988400	No worries.
6988400	6989020	See you later.
6989020	6990620	Bye bye.
6990620	6992860	So refreshing to hear from the folks around the world.
6992860	6993780	It's so great.
6993780	6996260	How come we haven't had any Canadians tonight?
6996260	6997140	That's very strange.
6997140	6998380	We want Canadians to call next.
6998380	6999420	We want Canadians.
6999420	7000140	All right.
7000140	7001620	I declare there must be Canadians.
7001620	7005380	Not that we don't love the Argentina, the Mexico, the US, you know.
7005380	7008820	But Europe might be asking a bit much because it's probably like what now?
7008820	7010940	It's like the sun's starting to rise over there.
7010940	7012180	But what about some Canadians?
7012180	7013700	I know there's got to be a few listening.
7013700	7013860	All right.
7013860	7014980	Let's go to another call.
7014980	7016360	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7016360	7017460	Who's this?
7017460	7019220	Hello, this is Jayden.
7019220	7021380	I'm sorry, who?
7021380	7022420	Jayden.
7022420	7024300	Hi, what's on your mind?
7024300	7024860	Nothing much.
7024860	7028500	I just wanted to congratulate you on your fifth.
7028500	7029580	Well, thank you very much.
7029580	7032220	I have my fifth beer.
7032220	7032900	Pardon?
7032900	7033500	Nothing.
7033500	7036460	I was saying my fifth beer.
7036460	7038060	I do that all the time.
7038060	7038900	I know.
7038900	7043740	Well, thank you very much.
7043740	7048300	Is there a particular something something that you want to share with listeners tonight?
7048300	7052420	Like, how long have you been listening to this show?
7052420	7053100	Let's see.
7053100	7055780	I think this is going on my third beer.
7055780	7056380	Awesome.
7056380	7060260	Well, what do you think has been a big, big game story that you really enjoyed our coverage
7060260	7064180	on in the past three years?
7064180	7068780	The anticipation of the Xbox 360.
7068780	7071780	Ah, the anticipation of the Xbox 360.
7071780	7074420	You know, I wasn't sold on the Xbox 360 at first.
7074420	7076700	I really wasn't.
7076700	7080620	And also the introduction of new systems in general.
7080620	7085460	Oh, kind of like being able to kind of be watching this new wave of the whole next gen
7085460	7089620	systems, kind of watch this unfold because, you know, all these systems didn't exist,
7089620	7092180	the PS3, the Wii, the 360 back when we started.
7092180	7096100	Hell, I don't even think the Xbox existed when we first started, or maybe it had just
7096100	7097100	come out.
7097100	7098100	I don't know.
7098100	7099100	I think it was out.
7099100	7100100	When did the Xbox come out?
7100100	7101100	2001?
7101100	7102100	So maybe it was just out.
7102100	7104260	So, but anyway, yeah, we kind of got to watch this all unfold.
7104260	7105260	I don't know.
7105260	7108820	Loki, what, you bought a 360 the day they came out, right?
7108820	7109820	No.
7109820	7110820	You bought a bidded one.
7110820	7111820	You eBay'd one or something.
7111820	7113820	I bought it off of Craigslist for like twice as what it's worth.
7113820	7116460	Oh, I remember getting so mad at you about that.
7116460	7117660	But why did you do it?
7117660	7118660	Was it the hype?
7118660	7119660	Was it the games?
7119660	7125220	I just wanted to talk about it, and I'm crazy, very crazy when it comes to talking about
7125220	7126220	games and stuff.
7126220	7127220	I don't know.
7127220	7130860	I just felt like I wanted one.
7130860	7131860	It was big.
7131860	7136340	I got to keep my edge at work, you know?
7136340	7139580	You know what sold me on Xbox 360, sad but true?
7139580	7143260	Geometry Wars, and Xbox Live Arcade in general.
7143260	7147340	I just was so, I was like, this is the coolest thing ever, and that's really what, so it
7147340	7151060	wasn't even any of the launch games that I really cared, although I did buy like Cameo
7151060	7155500	and I don't know what even else I bought at launch, but it was Xbox Live Arcade.
7155500	7159580	I bought Cameo, Ridge Racer 6, actually I pretty much bought almost everything that
7159580	7167660	came out at launch between launch and like March, because I bought, I remember, I think
7167660	7175620	one of the big ones I bought was Call of Duty 2, and then I bought Project Gotham Racing
7175620	7185020	3, also Cameo, and then Perfect Dark Zero, and I bought almost everything that came out
7185020	7186020	at launch.
7186020	7187020	Addict.
7187020	7190700	No, caller, did you get in on the Xbox 360, Grace?
7190700	7192980	No, I didn't.
7192980	7194300	You didn't buy one until way later, huh?
7194300	7196020	Or did you, do you even have one?
7196020	7197220	No, I don't have one.
7197220	7198220	Oh, wow.
7198220	7200220	Because I'm not an Xbox person.
7200220	7201220	Huh.
7201220	7202780	Well, you know, not everybody is.
7202780	7203780	Well, then what are you?
7203780	7204780	Are you a Nintendo person?
7204780	7207100	I'm a Nintendo person.
7207100	7209740	Ah, so did you camp out for a Wii?
7209740	7210740	No.
7210740	7212740	You're not that crazy.
7212740	7215500	No, I'm not that crazy.
7215500	7217820	I thought about it at one point in time, but.
7217820	7220820	I thought it was fun when we went to the Wii lines with cookies.
7220820	7225060	I had a lot of fun listening, and actually I wanted to.
7225060	7226740	We did Donuts and Coffee, me and Kristen.
7226740	7230460	Yeah, I know, and we were doing Orange Soda, and then you guys one-upped us with the Donuts
7230460	7231460	and Coffee.
7231460	7233420	But they also let us skip up the line.
7233420	7234420	That was awesome.
7234420	7238580	And I still remember the line at the Target Great Land over on Sunrise.
7238580	7239980	That's where we were.
7239980	7240980	That was awesome.
7240980	7243700	And we had a listener of the show on the line.
7243700	7244700	A couple.
7244700	7246360	I want to know if any of them are still listening.
7246360	7247620	For the love of God, email us.
7247620	7248620	Let's get together and play Wii sometime.
7248620	7251920	I want to know who the girl who got the Wii hat was.
7251920	7252920	I want to say hi to her.
7252920	7253920	Somebody saw her later.
7253920	7255460	I saw her at GameStop a while back.
7255460	7256460	You saw her, that's right.
7256460	7258300	If you guys are still listening, email us.
7258300	7263060	Rob, Jamie, mailbag at orangedollasradio.com, any of that, and let's have you guys on the
7263060	7264060	show at some point.
7264060	7266820	We want to talk like the Wii six months later or whatever it is.
7266820	7267820	Anyway, sorry, caller.
7267820	7268820	I've been ignoring you.
7268820	7270940	Is there anything else you want to share with our listeners?
7270940	7271940	Let's see.
7271940	7274940	DS's reaction to the DS.
7274940	7277140	Funny enough.
7277140	7278940	Dark Soccer's reaction to the DS.
7278940	7280700	Something that shares your namesake.
7280700	7282260	Do you approve?
7282260	7283300	I guess.
7283300	7285100	It's almost as cool as me.
7285100	7288380	Do you remember when we went and bought our DS?
7288380	7293680	We went to Best Buy, bought them there, and then we also went to Benihana's afterwards
7293680	7295780	for lunch.
7295780	7297620	Most money I've ever spent in a single day, probably.
7297620	7302260	I found Dan's box for his DS, because they all got theirs at GameStop before launch date,
7302260	7303260	of course.
7303260	7305620	It said, this DS is reserved for Dan.
7305620	7307020	If you touch it, you die.
7307020	7308020	I won't forget the first time.
7308020	7309140	The post-it's still on the box.
7309140	7313100	The first PSP I bought, I bought it, and then I...
7313100	7314100	What happened?
7314100	7318140	Oh, I got a car accident that day, because I don't know.
7318140	7320240	A slow moving car accident, by the way.
7320240	7323260	I was moving under five miles an hour.
7323260	7324260	That's amazing.
7324260	7325260	It did.
7325260	7327020	It dented up my fender, and that's about it.
7327020	7330380	You know the DS is the only other system I've ever bought at launch, besides a Wii?
7330380	7333940	So, I bought the PSP a week after it came out.
7333940	7334940	All right, sorry, caller.
7334940	7338780	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
7338780	7339780	Nope.
7339780	7341940	Other than the fact that I...
7341940	7348380	The one episode that really sticks out to me, because I have a recording of it, is 120.
7348380	7349780	What's so special about 120?
7349780	7352340	You'll have to forgive us, but they all start to blend together when you've been doing it
7352340	7354860	for five years.
7354860	7362100	Because one of the big things is that Loki mis-called the Xbox the Xbox Two at the time.
7362100	7363100	Did he?
7363100	7366940	Well, they probably didn't have a name then.
7366940	7370260	Did it have a name, or was he just being dumb?
7370260	7374860	He didn't have a name for it, but he mentioned it several times.
7374860	7375860	Interesting.
7375860	7380620	Well, I mean, if they don't have a name for it yet, obviously it's going to be the Xbox
7380620	7381620	Two.
7381620	7384940	But we need to go back and listen to what we thought about things before they actually
7384940	7385940	came out.
7385940	7390780	I wouldn't go like, I think they're going to be stupid and name it 360, because it'll
7390780	7391780	be circular.
7391780	7392780	I don't know.
7392780	7393780	All right.
7393780	7394780	You called the PS3 name, right?
7394780	7398780	Well, yeah, because they didn't innovate on their name.
7398780	7400660	We're going to put a three on there.
7400660	7401660	Yeah.
7401660	7402660	All right.
7402660	7405300	Caller, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling.
7405300	7406300	Yep, sure.
7406300	7407300	You're done.
7407300	7408300	All right, later.
7408300	7409300	All right.
7409300	7410300	Bye.
7410300	7411300	Bye.
7411300	7412300	We've got to let you go to get some more calls.
7412300	7413300	Now it's starting to trickle up a little bit.
7413300	7416680	We still have some people hammering us that have been since the beginning, so we'll get
7416680	7417680	to everybody.
7417680	7421300	We're going to keep calling until the calls stop coming in or we pass out tired, whichever
7421300	7422300	happens first.
7422300	7424060	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7424060	7425060	Who's this?
7425060	7427180	A token Canadian calling in.
7427180	7430900	Hi, what's your name for those who don't know?
7430900	7431900	It's Tochen.
7431900	7432900	What's up, guys?
7432900	7433900	Tochen, what's up?
7433900	7434900	See?
7434900	7436140	Ask and you shall receive.
7436140	7437660	We got a Canadian on the line.
7437660	7439540	Yay, thank you.
7439540	7440540	What else can I do?
7440540	7441540	I don't know.
7441540	7442540	Do a cartwheel.
7442540	7443540	Say a boot.
7443540	7444540	No, I'm kidding.
7444540	7445540	I'm totally kidding.
7445540	7446540	I'll bring pizza or something.
7446540	7447540	I don't know.
7447540	7450540	Tochen, dude, anything you want to say?
7450540	7452860	Are you only calling in because we forced you to, or is there anything you want to say
7452860	7453860	or ask or what?
7453860	7454860	No, no, no.
7454860	7457900	I want to be like everybody else and congratulate you on the five years.
7457900	7463660	I'm probably not the longest listener, but I've been around for a while and I just haven't
7463660	7468140	had the nerve to jump in the chat room as much as I should.
7468140	7471340	Because you were on DDR Freak several years ago.
7471340	7472780	You've been posting there a while, right?
7472780	7476980	Yeah, we've got a small little thread for our DDR people.
7476980	7477980	Sweet.
7477980	7482560	The reason why I mention that is because obviously when our show first started, a large, large
7482560	7486780	contingent of our listeners were all DDR Freak members and people from that community.
7486780	7490180	So I do remember seeing your face around there back in the day, so.
7490180	7494740	Yeah, the small little Nova Scotia thread for anybody who wants to go check it out.
7494740	7496740	We still got some life.
7496740	7500580	And the machines have not frozen over, contrary to popular belief.
7500580	7501580	No they're not.
7501580	7507020	But we've got to deal with some of the machine's issues because they're in bad shape.
7507020	7510620	You know what my favorite thread on DDR Freak was always?
7510620	7512620	Was the Antarctica thread.
7512620	7515740	Yeah, that was pretty funny.
7515740	7520200	Because nobody lives in Antarctica, of course there's not a DDR machine there.
7520200	7524380	But it was funny because I guess J-Dog or whoever built the forums, in one of the forums
7524380	7528760	it says, rest of the world DDR scene, and it just kind of throws all these kind of countries
7528760	7533340	that weren't accounted for other places in one, and it says, what is this, South America
7533340	7536320	and then Antarctica.
7536320	7539540	And somebody always makes this post like, dude, let's get together in Antarctica and
7539540	7541300	play DDR.
7541300	7543660	Stay warm.
7543660	7544940	Try to keep moving.
7544940	7545940	Exactly.
7545940	7548340	Well, Tochen, thanks for answering the call.
7548340	7549500	We appreciate it.
7549500	7552620	Any other last things you want to say?
7552620	7557900	I want to just, how are you doing with, I know you played DDR and B-Money for a while.
7557900	7560180	What's your favorite game that you've played throughout the years?
7560180	7564000	Is it just B-Money or DDR stepping?
7564000	7567740	My favorite music game that I've played in the past five years?
7567740	7568740	Yeah.
7568740	7572300	Absolutely, without a doubt, BeatMania 2DX8 style in the arcade.
7572300	7573880	Oh, sexy.
7573880	7579740	Because technically my favorite, favorite mix, music and all, would probably be sixth
7579740	7580740	or seventh style.
7580740	7584620	But the thing about eighth style is it had all those songs in it, and that was the machine
7584620	7590540	that we had here locally for the little time we did, and such community events.
7590540	7594400	And those that know me well know what a big ham I am.
7594400	7596740	One of my favorite things to do is host.
7596740	7599720	When I was young, I always wanted to be a game show host, if it's not completely obvious
7599720	7603180	through some of the things that happen on the show.
7603180	7607420	That's part of the reason I continue to be an emcee-ish sort of role on this show.
7607420	7612180	I love doing that kind of stuff at tournaments, and running the BeatMania 2DX tournament,
7612180	7615700	one of the very few that's ever been run, being able to run that tournament on that
7615700	7617540	eighth style machine at Scandi was a dream.
7617540	7619660	And the mix itself was awesome.
7619660	7625620	The music that was in it and everything, just really the peak of the 2DX series for me.
7625620	7629740	So are you planning to get distorted and stuff in the coming weeks?
7629740	7633540	Like I said, eighth was kind of the peak, and my interest in the series is kind of weighing
7633540	7634540	since then.
7634540	7639500	But I will always love the game, and I can't justify spending $80 on it.
7639500	7640500	Not now, not right now.
7640500	7641500	You can always...
7641500	7644220	No, but I don't go there, you know.
7644220	7645220	Maybe.
7645220	7646220	I don't know.
7646220	7647220	Import, man.
7647220	7648220	Come on.
7648220	7649220	Well, let's see.
7649220	7650220	I import from the internet.
7650220	7651540	Straight to my hard drive.
7651540	7656300	The Rob D says, from Bob Barker to Rob Roberts, dude, that would be my dream.
7656300	7660600	I actually, secretly in the back of my mind, I secretly wish that they would do an American
7660600	7664420	Idol style show to replace him, because I would so go there.
7664420	7665420	You know what we have to hear now?
7665420	7668340	We have to hear that song.
7668340	7669340	Come on down?
7669340	7670340	Yes.
7670340	7673680	Maybe later in the show, because I don't have it queued up right now.
7673680	7676740	You never have anything queued up at this time, though.
7676740	7677740	It's getting late.
7677740	7678740	Give me a break.
7678740	7679740	You need more pizza.
7679740	7680740	All right.
7680740	7681740	Take care.
7681740	7682740	We ate it all.
7682740	7683740	It's all gone.
7683740	7684740	The three of us ate the whole damn pizza.
7684740	7685740	What?
7685740	7686740	A large.
7686740	7687740	A large?
7687740	7688740	Oh, my God.
7688740	7689740	All right.
7689740	7690740	Bye, Tosha.
7690740	7691740	Thanks so much for the call.
7691740	7692740	We appreciate it.
7692740	7693740	Yeah.
7693740	7694740	Love that.
7694740	7698740	Ask for a Canadian, and ye shall receive a Canadian.
7698740	7699740	All right.
7699740	7705180	We're well past the two-hour mark now, so we're going to go into the two-minute lightning
7705180	7708500	round, and now all our calls are going to be wrapped up in two minutes or less.
7708500	7709500	Here we go.
7709500	7710500	Starting off.
7710500	7711500	Jamie, your call.
7711500	7712500	What?
7712500	7713500	Hello?
7713500	7714500	Hello.
7714500	7715500	Hi.
7715500	7716500	Hi.
7716500	7717500	It's the Afro guy.
7717500	7718500	Hi.
7718500	7719500	Hi.
7719500	7720500	What's on your mind?
7720500	7721500	Afro guy.
7721500	7724500	Hi.
7724500	7728500	Turn down your speakers, buddy.
7728500	7729500	Sorry.
7729500	7730500	That's okay.
7730500	7731500	That's okay.
7731500	7732500	Are you calling us from the UK?
7732500	7733500	Yeah.
7733500	7734500	Ah, I knew it.
7734500	7735500	I could tell from the accent.
7735500	7736500	That's amazing.
7736500	7737500	And I recognize your name, too.
7737500	7738500	Wow.
7738500	7739500	So you're like, it's early morning.
7739500	7740500	It's almost six in the morning, yeah.
7740500	7741500	You are hard.
7741500	7742500	What are you doing awake?
7742500	7743500	We're listening to the fifth anniversary show.
7743500	7752980	Well, we appreciate you tuning in.
7752980	7756740	You are a hardcore fan, sir.
7756740	7759380	I wish we weren't in the two-minute lightning round at this point.
7759380	7760380	What do you want to say?
7760380	7764380	I just want to say thanks for doing the show for five years.
7764380	7767620	I mean, I've only been listening for about two years since starting the podcast.
7767620	7768620	Well, you're welcome.
7768620	7772620	I mean, we do this for folks like you that continue to listen in.
7772620	7777380	And especially around the world, that blows my mind how the Internet brings us that closer
7777380	7779380	together as gaming fans.
7779380	7780380	Great.
7780380	7784620	Well, now I've cooled in, I think I'm going to go to bed.
7784620	7785620	I'm so tired.
7785620	7786620	All right.
7786620	7787620	I say that's a good call.
7787620	7788620	Sleep in today.
7788620	7789620	Sleep well.
7789620	7790620	You've earned it, my friend.
7790620	7791620	Thank you.
7791620	7792620	All right.
7792620	7793620	Have a good one, buddy.
7793620	7794620	All right.
7794620	7795620	See you.
7795620	7796620	See you.
7796620	7797620	Bye-bye.
7797620	7800860	Poor neighbors, because you must be blasting the show at 6 a.m. over there, because we're
7800860	7801860	hearing it on the speakers.
7801860	7804740	Unless we had a room with an echo.
7804740	7805740	Could be.
7805740	7806740	That's right.
7806740	7807740	Yeah, it could be.
7807740	7808740	It could be.
7808740	7809740	Or he's trying to keep it down.
7809740	7810740	I don't know.
7810740	7811740	Who knows?
7811740	7812740	All right.
7812740	7813740	Two-minute lighting around.
7813740	7814740	Let's take some more calls.
7814740	7815740	Hi.
7815740	7816740	You're on Orange Lawn's radio.
7816740	7817740	Who's this?
7817740	7818740	Hello?
7818740	7819740	Hi.
7819740	7820740	You got through, finally.
7820740	7821740	Who is this?
7821740	7822740	Nintendo Maniac 64.
7822740	7823740	Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.
7823740	7824740	What's on your mind?
7824740	7825740	I don't know.
7825740	7826740	Not much.
7826740	7828740	I guess I'm on the opposite side of the spectrum.
7828740	7829740	It's not really morning.
7829740	7830740	It's early.
7830740	7834500	It's kind of late night, 1253 a.m. here.
7834500	7841140	It's about 10 p.m. here, so we're getting pretty late, even for California time, but
7841140	7842140	that's okay.
7842140	7843140	What's on your mind?
7843140	7851420	One thing I remember is something someone said, about your first game and stuff that
7851420	7852420	you played.
7852420	7858260	In all honesty, my very first game, I was like three or four something, was Mortal Kombat.
7858260	7861220	Your first game was Mortal Kombat?
7861220	7863780	I didn't even know what it was.
7863780	7866820	Was it the version where they replaced the blood with the sweat, though, because that
7866820	7867820	doesn't count?
7867820	7868820	It was the Genesis version.
7868820	7870460	Oh, it was the Genesis version.
7870460	7872020	So did you put in the blood code?
7872020	7875340	I don't know.
7875340	7876340	Only three or four.
7876340	7883140	I didn't have my own game system until I was nine or something, or talking six when I got
7883140	7884140	my mom's.
7884140	7885140	I tried 2600.
7885140	7886140	That didn't count.
7886140	7887500	Quick question for you, because our time is limited.
7887500	7891300	Have you ever killed anybody or beat anybody up to the point that they were bleeding and
7891300	7892900	had to go to the hospital?
7892900	7893900	I have no idea.
7893900	7895620	I was way too young to remember anything.
7895620	7896620	No, I mean, but now.
7896620	7897620	I was Mortal Kombat.
7897620	7901860	But as of now, have you ever killed anyone or sent anyone to the hospital in real life?
7901860	7902860	No.
7902860	7909180	Well, I'm just trying to say that exposing kids to violent games doesn't necessarily
7909180	7910180	make them murderers.
7910180	7911180	That's all.
7911180	7912180	All right.
7912180	7915100	Anything else you want to share with listeners?
7915100	7921740	Oh, I finally got my own pretty good computer rake now, not like a 533 megahertz PC.
7921740	7926060	God, I thought he was going to say I got my own podcast.
7926060	7928340	I don't have a podcast.
7928340	7929340	That's all right.
7929340	7930340	Two minutes is up, buddy.
7930340	7932340	But thanks so much for the call, and take care, okay?
7932340	7933340	Okay.
7933340	7934340	All right.
7934340	7935340	Bye-bye.
7935340	7936340	Bye.
7936340	7937340	All right.
7937340	7938340	Let's go to another call.
7938340	7939340	These poor people have been trying to get in all night long.
7939340	7940340	We've got to get their calls.
7940340	7941340	Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.
7941340	7942340	Who's this?
7942340	7943340	It's Dark Knight.
7943340	7945260	It's Dark Knight.
7945260	7946860	We can barely, barely hear you.
7946860	7947860	Get a little closer to your night.
7947860	7948860	Is that Dark Knight?
7948860	7949860	Yes, it's Dark Knight, but we can barely hear him.
7949860	7950860	Hello?
7950860	7951860	Hey.
7951860	7952860	Hey, what's on your mind?
7952860	7953860	Quick shout out.
7953860	7954860	What?
7954860	7963180	Congratulations, y'all guys, on five years, and hope that y'all do five more years while
7963180	7965780	y'all still around and everything like that.
7965780	7974660	And to back-talk the gaming thing, my first game assistant was an Atari 2600.
7974660	7975660	Mine too.
7975660	7976660	Preach on.
7976660	7977660	Atari 2600 was awesome.
7977660	7980460	And we'll try to do another five years if we can.
7980460	7989900	We're going to keep going until we're out of gas, but we'll do our best.
7989900	7995020	So what was the first game you ever played on Atari 2600, do you remember?
7995020	7996020	Asteroids.
7996020	7997140	Good time.
7997140	7999780	I was just playing that the other day on the PC.
7999780	8001260	Good times.
8001260	8002740	It was a gift from my aunt.
8002740	8004820	My aunt bought me an Atari 2600.
8004820	8005820	That was a Christmas gift.
8005820	8006820	Awesome.
8006820	8007820	Yeah.
8007820	8008820	I had it for years.
8008820	8014180	But then after that, it was Sega Master System, Sega, everything else, till PlayStation.
8014180	8018340	Well Dark Knight, our time is halfway up, but I got to ask you real quickly, is there
8018340	8019900	anything that you want to share?
8019900	8022020	Because I know you've been a long-time listener of Orange Andrea.
8022020	8024780	I recognize your name from chat from years ago.
8024780	8027660	Is there a favorite moment?
8027660	8031500	Loki getting drunk and parents calling the show.
8031500	8033220	When our parents have called in?
8033220	8036220	Yeah, and Loki was the best one.
8036220	8037980	Loki had the best parent call.
8037980	8040300	Yeah, because it was sister.
8040300	8042580	Oh, it was sister.
8042580	8046220	And then next thing you know, it was the parents behind her.
8046220	8047220	I remember that.
8047220	8048220	Parents and grandparents.
8048220	8049220	That was good.
8049220	8050220	That was good.
8050220	8051220	Dark Knight, our time is almost up.
8051220	8052220	Quick, any last minute thoughts?
8052220	8057900	No, just want to say I'm happy five years old and keep it rocking guys.
8057900	8059180	All right, we will do it buddy.
8059180	8060940	Thanks so much for your support over the past five years.
8060940	8061940	We appreciate it.
8061940	8062940	Thank you.
8062940	8063940	Bye-bye.
8063940	8065660	He got progressively louder as the call went on.
8065660	8066660	Very nice job.
8066660	8067660	Appreciate that.
8067660	8069300	He started to turn the volume up or something.
8069300	8070700	Loki, your call.
8070700	8072660	Hello, this is Orange Launch Radio.
8072660	8073660	Who is this?
8073660	8074660	Hey, it's S.S.
8074660	8075660	D.H.
8075660	8076660	Martin.
8076660	8077660	Hey, how's it going?
8077660	8089140	I just want to wish you guys a happy fifth birthday, I guess.
8089140	8094300	And I also want to thank Rob for coming out to New York and having a great time with us.
8094300	8095680	I had an awesome time.
8095680	8099060	It was so much better this year than last year and no offense against last year.
8099060	8103180	We did our thing and had fun, but that was more of a me thing because I had more time
8103180	8105500	this year to actually go around and do stuff.
8105500	8108180	And the stuff we did this year was going to Dave and Buster's and going to that video
8108180	8109180	game shop.
8109180	8110180	It was good.
8110180	8111180	It was just like we were buds hanging out.
8111180	8112180	It was a good time.
8112180	8113180	I had a really good time.
8113180	8114180	Yeah.
8114180	8115180	It was great.
8115180	8116180	And you know, that's how gamers should be.
8116180	8121580	And this is, and you know, or we're just one big family and that's how we should always
8121580	8122580	be.
8122580	8123580	Awesome.
8123580	8127500	Well, hey, since you're in New York or at least the New York area, if a gamer is thinking
8127500	8131500	of visiting the area because New York is a huge tourist spot, where are some places they
8131500	8137060	must go in New York?
8137060	8143860	I just moved back here, but you know, big New York places, I would say go to the forums
8143860	8147980	because the locals really know where the good places are.
8147980	8153340	You know, there's a lot of bad places, you know, there are basically cracks in the wall.
8153340	8158000	You can't, you would never be able to find an event if you tried, but I would just like
8158000	8161540	hit the forum, I would just say hit the forums, ask everyone.
8161540	8166340	There's plenty of places, you know, in Midtown, but you know, outside in the other boroughs,
8166340	8169840	like Queens or Brooklyn, you know, there's plenty of great places.
8169840	8171340	What about Nintendo World Store?
8171340	8173980	Well, yeah, Nintendo World Store is great.
8173980	8177860	I mean, I thought you meant like arcades type stuff.
8177860	8178860	No, that's true.
8178860	8179860	That's true.
8179860	8182820	And those are good stuff to point out too because you know, certain people when they
8182820	8187060	try, you know, they want to find that local fighting game or dance game community or whatever
8187060	8188060	it is.
8188060	8189300	SJ100, Matt, our time is up.
8189300	8191780	Any, real, real quickly, any last minute thoughts?
8191780	8194700	Well, no, I, you know, I've been trying to call in all night.
8194700	8196180	I wanted to ask this one question.
8196180	8202220	You know, you guys have been on for five years and what would be the one thing you would
8202220	8208700	like to accomplish within the next five years?
8208700	8210580	Big question, so I'm going to let someone else start off.
8210580	8213980	What would be the one thing you'd like to accomplish in the next five years?
8213980	8214980	With the show?
8214980	8219820	Or with the show or in general or what?
8219820	8223740	With the show?
8223740	8231500	I would really call this ambitious, but I would really like to not only do this internet
8231500	8233780	based but do it satellite based as well.
8233780	8234780	Yeah.
8234780	8235780	Loki?
8235780	8242220	To have my wife approve of the show.
8242220	8243220	That's a big one, right?
8243220	8246500	That's a very Blocked Eagle right there.
8246500	8250580	I'm going to be a little bit controversial because I know how Jamie feels about this
8250580	8252540	idea but I'm going to say video.
8252540	8258860	See, that would be cool, you know, and I think you know, Rob, that, you know, I'm kind of
8258860	8259860	in that business.
8259860	8264420	You know, if you guys ever need someone to shoot it or direct it, I'm here.
8264420	8265700	Help me talk Jamie into it.
8265700	8267260	That's what you got to help me do.
8267260	8269660	All right, we really got to let you go.
8269660	8271460	We're over time, but take care, buddy.
8271460	8272460	Okay.
8272460	8273460	Take it easy, guys.
8273460	8274460	Bye bye.
8274460	8276140	All right, I think it's slowing down.
8276140	8278900	I think we've only got a couple calls left, but I really want to give a chance for everybody
8278900	8279900	to get through.
8279900	8281900	Jamie, how about you?
8281900	8282900	Hello.
8282900	8283900	Hello.
8283900	8284900	Who be?
8284900	8289900	This is Wonder Dog Harold.
8289900	8290900	Hi.
8290900	8291900	Hello.
8291900	8295900	What do you have to say to us?
8295900	8299020	What do you have to say for yourself?
8299020	8301460	Congratulations on your fifth anniversary.
8301460	8303020	Thank you.
8303020	8305020	Did you get us a present?
8305020	8310260	No, like the customary gift for the first anniversary is this one.
8310260	8311260	Is what?
8311260	8312260	It's wood.
8312260	8313260	It's wood.
8313260	8314260	I got wood.
8314260	8315260	I have no wood.
8315260	8316260	There you go.
8316260	8317260	No gift needed.
8317260	8324460	Will you try to get some wood for our fifth anniversary?
8324460	8325700	Maybe.
8325700	8328540	All right.
8328540	8332340	Is there a game out there that gives you wood?
8332340	8333820	No.
8333820	8335940	No?
8335940	8340380	That's good because that would be maybe crossing the line.
8340380	8344180	Really, there's been no game character ever that might give you a little wood?
8344180	8345180	No.
8345180	8346180	All right.
8346180	8350760	Well, has anybody in here ever been a video game character that gave you a little wood
8350760	8353000	or the lady equivalent?
8353000	8360500	My first video game crush was Ryu from Street Fighter II.
8360500	8361820	Tingle?
8361820	8363260	Who?
8363260	8364700	What?
8364700	8366580	What caller?
8366580	8367580	You said what?
8367580	8372620	No, I tried to like stick in Tingle in there real quick.
8372620	8373620	Oh, Tingle.
8373620	8374620	Tingle.
8374620	8375620	No.
8375620	8376620	This was when I was in high school.
8376620	8378180	I got you.
8378180	8380580	Loki, any character ever given you wood?
8380580	8381580	No.
8381580	8382580	No Dead or Alive?
8382580	8383580	No.
8383580	8388140	Somebody in our chat room was trying to start a petition for Dead or Alive Xtreme Volleyball
8388140	8389140	with men.
8389140	8392540	I don't know about that one.
8392540	8394020	Any last minute thoughts caller?
8394020	8395020	Nope.
8395020	8396020	All right.
8396020	8399020	Well, you're a man of many words, Wonder Dog Harold.
8399020	8400020	As usual.
8400020	8401020	Thanks so much for the call.
8401020	8402020	Take care, buddy.
8402020	8403020	Bye-bye.
8403020	8404020	Bye.
8404020	8408540	Remember when he called in the match game a few weeks ago and was giving all one word
8408540	8409540	answers?
8409540	8411820	I think the phone lines may have stopped.
8411820	8413180	There's no calls coming in right now.
8413180	8416420	Let me give it just a few more minutes to make sure and then we're going to call up.
8416420	8417420	There it is.
8417420	8418420	Here's one more.
8418420	8419420	This is going to be the last.
8419420	8420420	You had to encourage them, Rob.
8420420	8421420	This is the last call.
8421420	8422420	Last call.
8422420	8423420	Sorry, guys.
8423420	8426060	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio and this is the last call of the night.
8426060	8427060	Who's this?
8427060	8428060	Oh, my God.
8428060	8429060	Who is this?
8429060	8430060	This is CT.
8430060	8431060	Hey.
8431060	8436140	Hey, you were there from the first episode, dude.
8436140	8437140	What a good...
8437140	8438140	Absolutely.
8438140	8440860	What a good call to end on tonight because you were one of the...
8440860	8441860	Oh, my God.
8441860	8444940	You were one of the 15 people there for episode one.
8444940	8445940	Yeah.
8445940	8449300	Here's an amazing call to kind of bookend the shows tonight with.
8449300	8452660	Shit, I don't even know what to ask you, Dark Tetsuya.
8452660	8454500	Do you have anything for us tonight?
8454500	8458620	Well, oh, God.
8458620	8460980	I didn't even know where to begin.
8460980	8463460	I mean, I'm sorry.
8463460	8464460	I'm speechless.
8464460	8475020	I'm the biggest fangirl of the show that's interested in me and, well, you know, oh,
8475020	8476020	my God.
8476020	8477020	I forgot.
8477020	8484300	This show has helped facilitate a few OL relationships, which has been very interesting how that community,
8484300	8487980	just communities in general, can have that effect.
8487980	8490820	I've met a few people I've dated through live journals in that community.
8490820	8496340	I can't say I've ever met anyone in a gaming-related community, but it's just interesting the way
8496340	8497340	that works.
8497340	8501020	But, DT, you've been here for the whole thing.
8501020	8503620	What would you say was the highlight of the past five years?
8503620	8504620	Oh, my God.
8504620	8505620	I don't know.
8505620	8513860	Aside from that thing on 230, I'd probably have to go with Loki singing.
8513860	8518360	Isn't it amazing that after all these years, they still say that's their favorite moment?
8518360	8519360	That was awful.
8519360	8521620	I'm never doing it again.
8521620	8524260	So like it.
8524260	8525980	Live it up while it lasts.
8525980	8537220	I'm calling in, I want the host to know, I was like very shocked, because I asked out.
8537220	8538220	Whatever.
8538220	8541460	Oh, Dark Tetsuya, thank you for making it all worth it.
8541460	8542460	That was wonderful.
8542460	8547060	I do have a quick few, though.
8547060	8548060	All right.
8548060	8552420	I don't know, DT, because that's like the perfect note to end on, but if you must, go
8552420	8553420	for it.
8553420	8554420	F you.
8554420	8558100	F you to Burger King, because Missy has to work tonight.
8558100	8560460	F you to work in general.
8560460	8563300	Let's quit our jobs and move into the Fort.
8563300	8565100	Yeah.
8565100	8567580	The O-L-R Fort.
8567580	8569820	Dark Tetsuya, thank you so much for the call.
8569820	8570820	We appreciate it.
8570820	8572420	And you fucking won, by the way.
8572420	8574580	Out of all the callers tonight, you won.
8574580	8575580	Congratulations.
8575580	8576580	Thank you.
8576580	8577580	Take care.
8577580	8578580	Bye.
8578580	8583580	I'm calling in.
8583580	8590020	I now demand that all future call-ins begin with that.
8590020	8596060	Well guys, the calls have finally slowed down, but if we didn't get to you, we're so sorry
8596060	8602220	that we didn't make your phone call, but obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, and even to the podcast
8602220	8605460	listeners and those that weren't able to tune in live tonight and listen to us and be a
8605460	8606860	part of the show.
8606860	8610460	We just really want to thank you guys once again for your support over the past five
8610460	8615940	years and for tuning in and just inviting us onto your iPods or onto your speakers or
8615940	8620100	what have you, and for the enthusiasm that so many of you guys have for the show.
8620100	8622040	You guys have made it all worth it.
8622040	8627220	Anything that you guys want to share, Dark Sakura?
8627220	8630900	I would like to share with people's bank accounts so that they give me money.
8630900	8633460	No, really.
8633460	8634500	I just like doing this.
8634500	8637260	I'm going to keep doing it, so fuck everything.
8637260	8638900	I'm just going to do the show.
8638900	8639900	I'll try.
8639900	8645900	Thank you guys, and thank you for the five people who've sent me a dollar, by the way.
8645900	8648180	There's not going to be a pump up the volume, though, on Tuesday.
8648180	8654900	This is very important because Live 365 is doing a day of broadcasting silence to protest
8654900	8658580	whoever those fuckheads are that are doing all this bullshit to internet radio.
8658580	8659580	The government.
8659580	8660580	Yeah.
8660580	8661580	Like I said, fuckheads.
8661580	8666300	No pump up the volume on Tuesday, no nothing on Tuesday.
8666300	8671540	However, you best hold onto your pants on Wednesday because Rob's going to be on, right?
8671540	8672540	That's right.
8672540	8675900	The door is always open for you, Dark Sakura, if you want to come in and get a little revenge
8675900	8677900	on Wednesday since you can have a Tuesday show.
8677900	8679100	I don't know what you've got going on.
8679100	8680100	We'll see.
8680100	8681100	Oh, wait.
8681100	8682100	No, there is no show Wednesday.
8682100	8683100	I'm in Malibu Wednesday.
8683100	8684100	I can't go.
8684100	8685100	Bitch.
8685100	8686100	So maybe you could do your show Wednesday.
8686100	8687100	I don't know.
8687100	8688100	Hit me.
8688100	8689100	We'll talk.
8689100	8690100	And then drop me off in L.A. so I can go to some land.
8690100	8691100	We'll talk offline.
8691100	8692100	Yeah.
8692100	8693100	Yeah.
8693100	8694100	Jamie reminded me.
8694100	8697580	There are some thank yous that are badly, badly needed because there's like specific
8697580	8701260	individuals we have to thank because they've really made the five years with it.
8701260	8703860	And please, you know, God, it's just like an Oscar speech.
8703860	8704860	We're afraid we're going to forget somebody.
8704860	8708380	But if you guys think, think of anybody I'm forgetting, please let me know.
8708380	8715140	I want to first, foremost, most importantly, absolutely thank VX Jason XV who has been our
8715140	8719300	web host almost at least for like the past two and a half years we've been doing this
8719300	8720300	almost since the beginning.
8720300	8723100	It is an absolutely thankless job.
8723100	8724980	He asked for nothing for it.
8724980	8732660	He built us a podcast feed from scratch and the man just, he just does this because he
8732660	8736660	wants to and he loves what we're doing and without him we would not be able to accomplish
8736660	8737900	half of what we have.
8737900	8740540	So VX Jason XV, you are the man.
8740540	8742300	Thank you so much for all of your help.
8742300	8745420	He's like, he's, you know, even though we joke that the chat room is the invisible fourth
8745420	8749840	host of Orange Laundredo, Jason is like this invisible thing that you don't always see
8749840	8751620	on the air that's really holding the show up.
8751620	8754500	So thank you so much to Jason first and foremost.
8754500	8762040	I also want to say a big thank you to Travis Donovan of Travis Donovan Live because he
8762040	8766940	kind of got me into the whole internet broadcasting thing and Jamie to some extent because obviously
8766940	8769820	Under Station Live was the show we were doing before Orange Laundredo.
8769820	8771340	I was the number one guest.
8771340	8776020	And I see, I don't think Travis really approved of this side project in the beginning because
8776020	8780700	he saw it as maybe taking away from Under Station Live or what have you but, you know,
8780700	8784800	nevertheless, I learned a lot from my experiences on Under Station Live and just about like,
8784800	8789060	you know, kind of how an internet radio show should be and Travis never took any shit from
8789060	8791020	anyone and I always love that attitude.
8791020	8795020	So I want to say a big thank you to Travis for everything.
8795020	8799840	I want to say a big thank you as well to Bobby Blackwolf and Scott and Lawrence and everybody
8799840	8805880	over AllGames.com for enabling our show to a whole new audience because obviously signing
8805880	8809580	up with AllGames.com was one of the best moves we ever made in trying to grab ourselves some
8809580	8810580	rabid fans.
8810580	8814700	We just love the fact that our fan bases have kind of clicked in that way and while not
8814700	8819460	everybody on AllGames may like our show, those that have, we're very lucky to have over
8819460	8824340	here listening to OLR as well and we want to thank you guys for helping us get on board
8824340	8827700	with this indication over there and opening everything up over there.
8827700	8833580	God, I don't need, God, so many, I mean, obviously each and every person that's ever
8833580	8837540	listened to a live show, ever downloaded a podcast, everybody that's authored stories
8837540	8844740	for the website, Mel B, Dark Tetsuya, Jimmy, DMN, anybody that's been a part of OLR staff,
8844740	8849820	I want to thank Chris for a lot over the past few years.
8849820	8852140	God, who am I forgetting?
8852140	8853140	Anybody?
8853140	8854140	Anything?
8854140	8855140	Eh.
8855140	8856460	And viewers like you.
8856460	8857980	I mean, listeners.
8857980	8858980	All right.
8858980	8862620	And if I left you out, I'm very, very sorry, but it was kind of like a last minute thing
8862620	8863620	I wanted to bring up.
8863620	8867780	Loki, do you have anything you want to say?
8867780	8869100	Not until the after birth.
8869100	8871900	Okay, we'll leave it at that.
8871900	8876420	Loki, by the way, was not an official host of Orange Launch Radio for the first 20 episodes,
8876420	8880940	but you know what, he never missed a show and had that dedication and it's very interesting.
8880940	8886180	I didn't even freaking know Loki really before this show started, but now it's just,
8886180	8887180	you know.
8887180	8889060	I drove you down to golf land, dude.
8889060	8892700	Like, but that was like, but it wasn't like we didn't, you know, we didn't really know
8892700	8896140	know each other, like at that point, you know, I feel like I didn't really get to know you
8896140	8897140	until this show.
8897140	8900660	Like, I know who you were and obviously you did a lot of nice things.
8900660	8903900	That's what I want to say about Loki is that I know a lot of you think he's a total dick
8903900	8907120	based on the things that he says about Max and stuff, but he's actually one of the nicest
8907120	8912180	guys you'll ever meet offline and I'm sorry for ruining your internet persona and whatever,
8912180	8913180	he really is.
8913180	8914420	I don't have a persona.
8914420	8919300	And Jamie too, because I know, um, you know, she has sometimes the internet persona of
8919300	8925500	being the queen bee on orange, but she's really got a softy heart too.
8925500	8927020	You just don't always see it on the show.
8927020	8928020	You do.
8928020	8929020	It's, it's made of sponge.
8929020	8930420	No, it's not.
8930420	8932300	So it's, it's, it's plasmoid.
8932300	8936740	It's, it's a plasma, which means the electrons are charged and it's fiery.
8936740	8945660	I have a fiery heart.
8945660	8949540	Not everybody got to get through on the Skype line tonight, but this was the interesting
8949540	8954860	thing is that I logged into Skype today and there were voicemails waiting for us, congratulating
8954860	8957860	us on the fifth anniversary from people who wouldn't necessarily be able to be here on
8957860	8959180	the show tonight.
8959180	8962500	And so I hopped into chat and I said, well, it looks like we have some voicemails.
8962500	8963640	Anyone want to add some?
8963640	8965060	And we had some folks call in.
8965060	8969420	And so we're going to end it on this sound clip and then we're going to kind of wrap
8969420	8970420	it up and be out of here.
8970420	8971420	Oh wait, I'm sorry.
8971420	8973620	Do you want to do some last minute game stories before we get to that?
8973620	8974620	No.
8974620	8975620	Oh, oh, oh.
8975620	8976620	Yeah.
8976620	8977620	Real quick, just real quick.
8977620	8987020	There's a brand new hack in the PSP world that allows homebrew on any firmware so far
8987020	8989020	all the way up to 3.5.
8989020	8994300	And funny enough, it does not use Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, but it uses Luminous
8994300	9000340	and it's a luminati work around or whatever, exploit I guess they're calling it.
9000340	9007340	But very interesting to see that after all this time, Luminous can now allow you to run
9007340	9008340	homebrew.
9008340	9009340	Hmm.
9009340	9010600	It was there the whole time.
9010600	9012580	It's almost like a mystery novel.
9012580	9013580	Yeah.
9013580	9017260	Ah, Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail.
9017260	9018260	Is that it?
9018260	9020660	That's, yeah, that's pretty much it.
9020660	9022540	All right, until the after birth.
9022540	9024540	Let's get to the voicemails, folks.
9024540	9037540	Hello, I'm Lawrence Londreo, fifth anniversary show.
9037540	9043620	I am Insanus, the guy who does the show on Thursday.
9043620	9049260	I want to call you guys, wish you all a happy, happy, happy fifth anniversary from everybody
9049260	9053540	here at the Insanus Tower, which right now is me and four listeners.
9053540	9056700	So yeah.
9056700	9061860	But on behalf of everybody in the chat room right now, everyone is wanting to call you
9061860	9069380	guys and wish you a happy O of R fifth anniversary, Rob, Jamie, Matt, thanks for letting me have
9069380	9078140	an evening on the station where I can say as many curse words as I like and enjoy myself.
9078140	9079740	You guys are the reason I love doing this.
9079740	9084020	I got started because you guys, you probably have heard this shit some of the times before,
9084020	9085020	but it's true.
9085020	9086020	You guys are awesome.
9086020	9094860	Hopefully soon here, I'll be in Sacramento and we will all have a good, good time, but
9094860	9097180	let's just hope Rob keeps his pants on.
9097180	9103660	Jamie doesn't beat me with a Barrett and Matt doesn't throw an iPhone in my hand.
9103660	9112180	Anyways, guys, this is a long voice mail and I think I should stop talking like this because
9112180	9114620	I think I'm pissing you all off.
9114620	9118980	Also, Rob, your mom called and she still disappointed in you.
9118980	9122340	And my mom called and she still disappointed in you.
9122340	9123340	Okay.
9123340	9124340	I'm done.
9124340	9125340	Bye.
9125340	9136220	I don't remember what my screen name is on L.O.L.R., hi Rob, hi Jamie, I'm Rob, well I
9136220	9144380	talk to people on my face and Xbox Live, Rob, it's me, it's you, like, yes, anyway, wow,
9144380	9152420	five years, happy anniversary, all my enemies, worse half, better half, so I got to listen
9152420	9162340	to you people, um, yeah, uh, well, we wanted to say hello, say hello, hello, yes, he's
9162340	9168780	more lesbian than the official lesbian, well, more girly, anyway, um, wow, five years of
9168780	9174740	gaming goodness and listening to low-key bitch about women drivers, it's all good,
9174740	9181380	yeah, two, five more years at least, uh, all right, bye, hey, it's Missy, so, you know
9181380	9187140	I had to call in tonight, it'd be into the fifth year in a version and all, get to work
9187140	9195540	with her, all right, call in live, damn, I've been with you since 4-7-0-4, so it's been
9195540	9201700	three years and three months already, oh, that was on Wednesday too, wasn't it vanilla
9201700	9209140	sky that was the one she showed in, anyway, congrats on five years, yeah, I'll be thinking
9209140	9214980	about you when the minute works, bye, it's never long, why do you want to take my baby,
9214980	9220660	oh, I can't take my baby, happy this, hey, what's up, this is Tigerclaw, I would like
9220660	9225940	to wish Orange Launch Radio a happy five-year anniversary, I've been a long time listener
9225940	9231780	of the show since I first heard on AllGames.com and here hoping for five more years, take
9231780	9241700	care, hey, this is, uh, Mr. Gohan, congratulations on five years of podcasting, I guess, I have
9241700	9248100	a question about, um, I saw Sky on Xbox Live with the HD DVD player, I was wondering if
9248100	9252340	it's worth the buy because my brother kind of wants it and he's wondering if you should
9252340	9260180	get a PS3 instead just for Blu-ray and yeah, you guys have been doing an awesome job podcasting,
9260180	9265940	I've been listening for about two years now and you guys are just awesome, keep doing
9265940	9275220	what you're doing, bye, you gotta love that even on the last congratulatory message there's
9275220	9281540	a question there about the Blu-ray players, the HD DVD player, if you're buying, um, uh,
9281540	9288740	something just to watch movies, um, really either one, I mean, they say Blu-ray is winning
9288740	9292260	but I don't know if that's just marketing smoke and mirrors, I think it's too early
9292260	9295380	to tell, honestly, your safest bet is to not take the plunge yet, well, the reason why
9295380	9299620	they're saying it's winning is because there's more Blu-ray players out there because each
9299620	9303860	one of the PlayStation 3s is a Blu-ray player, so they're counting those in the numbers whether
9303860	9309220	people use them as a Blu-ray player or not, all right, so there's your answer, short and
9309220	9314580	sweet, all right, we're almost to the end, let's go around and get everybody's final
9314580	9319620	thought, Loki, I'm out of root beer, Dark Sakura,
9327300	9334020	uh, my final thought is, um, thank you, to those that care, thank you, you keep it going,
9334020	9340180	you keep it awesome, and we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 237,
9340180	9346980	5th, 5th, it's 5 years and 1 week anniversary next week, we'll do it all again, see ya.
