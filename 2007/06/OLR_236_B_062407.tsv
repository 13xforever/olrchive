487	19082	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
20478	24919	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this part B of episode number 236.
24959	28920	And this, of course, is our fifth year anniversary show.
28960	29420	That's right.
29580	41562	On June 23rd, 2002, we went live for the very first time with Orange Lounge Radio live episode number one, where some of the topics included... God, what were we talking about that week?
41582	42122	I don't even remember.
42322	43883	I think it was kind of more like an intro to the show.
43903	45883	We were talking about our experiences playing various...

76423	77004	Orange Lounge Radio
98559	101221	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.
121118	125001	Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.
143866	144387	Oh, God.
144767	148713	I've never... No, you know, in fact, today I have a modification to that.
149494	153720	If you won't take care of your child, I will have someone kill you.
155202	156964	Because I'm not going to take care of your child.
157204	158426	Wow, I don't know about that.
159557	160978	I'll have you shot in the head.
161559	162719	Headshot for the win.
163280	167743	Press A. Some users in chat are commenting on the quality of that clip.
167763	168124	That's right.
168584	171386	When Orange Launch Radio started, we were on a dial-up friendly stream.
171746	175249	So the stream you could hear was usable on 56k modems.
175349	177371	Because five years ago, a lot of people still were on those.
178371	181694	By the way, do you still own the drive that you have that saved on?
183129	185770	if you can find it, I may have a way to extract it
200498	201618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
230544	254982	and apparently it's come down the wire that the doctors from the AMA have backed away from their decision they're now recommending that the American Psychiatric Association who kind of would be the final judge and jury in this anyway do a little more research quote there is nothing here to suggest that this is a complex psychological disease state akin to alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders and it doesn't get to have the word addiction attached to it
255242	256263	I don't think it's addiction.
256283	257583	I think it's OCD.
257603	257944	All right.
279113	283315	Well, anyhow, as we promised here in Part B, we have a pizza on the way.
283375	286516	We're just going to... Our bread and cheese to go with our wine.
286696	295240	We're going to just kind of kick back and relax, because as we've said a lot this evening, Orange Launch Radio is about you guys, and we get asked all the time.
295760	296620	Thank you for watching!
315606	344590	but funny enough we started while they were on hiatus because of G4 and everything and Scott working at G4 and now it's kind of funny that we work together but regardless of all that I just say that because I know we've gained a lot of listeners thanks to our partnership with All Games but just there wasn't a lot like us when we started at least that we knew about so it's kind of interesting because now that podcasting is so huge and essentially any idiot with a microphone can have a podcast which really any idiot with a microphone before could do an internet radio show it's just you know
345131	345591	Thanks for watching!
358536	361157	We have true live interaction.
361217	367438	We like to pretend we're sitting around at a big table with our listeners and just talking about the latest in gaming.
367598	375860	Sometimes we break stories, although we probably won't be breaking them too much more in the future, but we're not usually thought of as a source for breaking news.
375921	379001	There's plenty of other game blogs who are paid to bring you breaking news.
379041	379962	We don't get paid for this.
380342	385503	So that's kind of what distinguishes us from everybody else is the listeners, the chatters, the live interaction that we have.
385743	387785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
409580	410501	Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
433174	434794	Hi guys, this is FootyMonster from Argentina.
434934	435835	Wow, I got the first call.
435915	438615	You did, you got the first call, FootyMonster.
438655	439075	Good for you.
439115	439755	What's on your mind?
440876	443596	Well, first of all, guys, I just wanted to say happy fifth birthday.
444596	449337	You've been with me at least for the last two years when I've actually found you guys right before you went into iTunes.
450038	452918	And it's been a great two years, dude.
452938	454118	I mean, it's amazing.
454199	456319	You've been there every Sunday, give or take.
456919	461100	And it's pretty cool to have that kind of your voice go with you all the time.
461530	462090	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
491246	494207	Because we don't always get to see that here.
494947	496948	Yeah, I called before about it once.
497028	497688	Yeah, I know.
497728	497948	I remember.
497968	499968	Basically, there's no official gaming market here.
500949	502429	So everything is a great market.
502449	506470	Like a 360 costs $700 and a PS3 costs $1,400.
506730	509491	Do you get a lot of gaming fans down there?
510291	511011	There is a lot.
511251	514032	I mean, here there's still an arcade scene, so to speak.
514656	521197	So we will see a lot of pumped-up DDR, maybe some guitar freaks, maybe, just maybe, because there's like a few machines.
521677	528339	But, like, you know, the King of Firescrout is still there, they go to the arcades, because those things are still affordable, so to speak.
528959	530299	Okay, I get that, that's cool.
531159	536020	And, I mean, here, the PS2 is still, like, full-blown, like, there's no next-gen here yet.
536840	540181	Like, because you can seriously go buy a backup of a PS2 game for five bucks.
541521	543963	You got any questions for us tonight or anything you wanted to say?
544183	546184	Because if you don't have anything for us, we'll grill you.
547105	549967	I mean, yeah, I actually have one question.
551027	560534	What do you have to say to, I mean, as you know, after iTunes and after all these gaming podcasts came out, many of us, of the listeners, actually started our own ventures into the thing.
561614	564876	Myself, I don't know if you guys remember, I have my own show, The Ultimate Quest.
564916	565937	It's an RPG exclusive show.
565957	567418	We just started that like a few months ago.
567678	568158	Good plug, good plug.
568178	568399	It's hard.
570283	571904	Yeah, I tried to mention it there.
573665	575906	But what do you say to us that actually are starting out?
576166	577427	What do you tell us?
578007	587751	Maybe a good advice or something that helps us keep at it when you're like life sucks and you don't want to edit the show that day and you just want to not do that thing that week.
588872	590593	What's your advice to all of us who are starting out?
591233	594895	I say the sooner you get it done, the sooner you don't have to do it again.
597516	599277	Get it out of the way out of spite.
601181	605303	I told you, everything I do practically is motivated by spite.
606023	606463	And porn.
607163	608644	Well, not so much the porn.
608864	611145	Life is things to go.
611725	614666	That's why my show kind of stopped twice.
615666	617367	Here's my advice, Footy Monster.
617567	620508	If you're doing the show, and I'm just saying this in general.
620528	624430	I'm not saying this at you, but in general to anybody who's thinking about starting a podcast or doing this.
625070	627971	If you are doing this program or if you're doing a program
629002	638498	to try and get more listeners than anyone else or try to get a listener count that's through the roof or to try and get a listener base that's the biggest one you've ever seen.
638959	641023	You're doing this for the wrong reasons.
641690	643811	You wouldn't even start if that was the reason.
644011	644791	Goodbye.
644811	646091	And there's no listeners.
646271	650312	You have to know, though, there are people out there that that is their sole motivation is attention.
650372	650932	And don't get me wrong.
651233	652413	Attention is lovely.
652813	656274	I mean, the attention whore side of me is what keeps me motivated for the past five years.
656294	657774	Attention can be bad sometimes.
658214	660215	Attention can be bad, as we learned a couple months ago.
660635	668977	But regardless, you've got to do this because, especially in these panel-based shows, you've got to really like the people that you're hanging out with.
669018	671138	You've really got to love the topic that you're talking about.
671158	675199	Or be able to fake it.
675619	680521	And I'm sure there's been those weeks where I've wanted to come in here and choke a bitch, namely Jamie.
680541	680641	Yeah.
682224	683384	I'm nice, Ron!
702945	703485	No, for real.
703545	713291	And I'm not saying that, you know, that's very rare that that kind of thing ever happens where like, you know, I'm like, oh, I'm mad at somebody tonight or I'm mad at the world and I'm going to take it out on Jamie tonight or Loki or whatever.
714032	714752	Oh, baby.
715853	721776	But it's like an opportunity for us to get together and just kind of like, this is kind of how I hang out with Jamie.
721816	724798	And these days, I used to live with Matt, but now this is how I hang out with him.
725158	726059	You know, it's kind of through this show.
726079	727720	Yeah, you never call, you never write.
727740	728060	That's not true.
728080	728640	What am I supposed to think?
728680	729461	That's not true.
731594	732635	Rob has left me.
733756	739182	To us listeners, it seems like you guys are hanging out like 24-7 because the chemistry that you guys have on air is just amazing.
740223	742044	It's like brothers and sisters.
742305	744767	You want to poke them in the eye just because you're annoyed at them.
747109	747810	And that's what it is.
747910	749011	Jamie's my gaming sister.
749091	749932	Matt's my gaming brother.
750372	751534	Poking in the eye.
751614	752795	I've never thought of that.
753375	754236	She has glasses, though.
754276	754977	I can't do that.
756827	758510	I have protective eyewear.
758930	759411	Roar.
759571	762956	Well, Footy Monster, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling in.
762976	763757	We appreciate it, okay?
764478	768403	All right, well, you guys keep it up, and happy fifth anniversary, and let's hope there's another five more.
768564	769044	Appreciate it.
769104	770166	And hey, quick question for you.
770206	773791	How long have you and the girl in your icon, who I believe was Canadian, how long have you two been together now?
774933	778635	I've been together three years and a half, and I'm actually going to see her in a month.
778795	779955	So, yeah, yay me.
780095	780576	Congrats, you two.
780596	784137	I just want to point out to Loki and Jamie, look at that cute little icon there.
784157	784717	They're kissing.
784817	785538	Ah, get a room.
785578	788479	Get a room.
788519	789980	I can't see through your big fat shoulder.
790060	790280	Sorry.
790920	792881	It keeps clicking away because other calls are dropping in.
792941	793861	Oh, that is cute.
794201	794522	All right.
795102	795522	There you go.
795602	796042	All right, guys.
796102	798503	Well, I'll let you guys go so you can take more calls.
798543	798723	All right.
798743	799904	We had to embarrass you on air, Footy.
800024	800484	My turn.
800724	801184	Take care, Footy.
801204	801485	All right.
801985	802245	Bye-bye.
802265	802545	See you all.
803322	805364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
832591	833275	Do it for the love.
834521	835627	I do it for drugs.
837861	838582	Raven Stolfen
865509	869030	I have a bunch of love for this community and video gaming.
869150	869751	I really do.
869991	871331	I've been gaming since I was three.
871751	872192	Three!
873272	873612	Amen.
874012	875073	You got me beat.
875093	877213	I started when I was four or five, I think.
877314	877794	I don't remember.
878034	879554	How old were you when you started gaming, DarkSakura?
880995	881795	Do you really want to know?
882035	882235	Yeah.
882676	886137	I think I was three when the Odyssey 2 came out.
887643	892204	Ozzy 2, I believe, came out in 1979, which I turned 3 in 1970.
892284	893905	I know that dates me.
894305	895285	I turned 3 in 1979.
896285	900607	So, if that shows, that was my first gaming system.
900927	901727	Loki, what about you?
902427	903627	I played the ColecoVision.
905048	906548	So, I don't remember.
906568	908169	It's like round 4.
908629	911150	My mom was playing Pac-Man when she was pregnant with me.
912670	913950	Wow, so it runs in the family.
913970	914631	Or Pong, sorry.
914671	915411	It runs in the family.
915831	916331	And pinball.
917379	918660	Very cool.
919320	919621	Wow.
919721	921162	What was your first game, Raven's Dolphin?
922563	925845	Believe it or not, it was Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo.
926245	926865	Ah, you kids.
927306	928626	You were three when that came out?
929407	930348	I was three.
930368	931068	Oh my god.
932609	932949	Sorry.
933730	935191	I know, you just reminded me how old I am.
935251	936271	No, no worries, no worries.
936772	937272	It's all good.
938673	942656	I'm sorry I missed out to all the 8-bit action, but it's not my fault.
943156	944837	Smurfs and Bump and Jump.
945553	948195	Dude, I hella remember Smurfs and the Atari Smurfs.
948775	949816	Our game was Mousetrap.
952358	953198	And we had Turbo.
953578	955059	But we had a setup for Turbo.
955400	959202	We would grab a chair and a TV tray and put the driving wheel on top of it.
959922	961564	That was where my addiction to peripherals came.
961824	962784	And Donkey Kong Jr.
962804	963605	and Kongo Bongo.
963625	964385	Those are the other ones.
965766	966086	Good times.
966106	967147	Two more things for you, Rob.
967607	968868	Venture.
968888	969369	What was that?
970069	970950	Two more things, Rob.
971130	971430	All right.
972245	975169	What was it you didn't like about the show, out of curiosity?
989165	990527	I don't have puppies.
990547	991668	Oh, my Nintendogs!
991848	993290	Oh, the five seconds I played that game.
1006266	1009288	The Rob D in chat says Nintendog still sells a ton.
1009308	1009569	Go figure.
1033399	1034619	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1052162	1054564	With all the love in my heart, I love you now.
1054784	1060949	You know, you do these live shows all the time, and I'm starting to do live and failing at it a little bit.
1061089	1063011	But how do you not fail at it like you normally do?
1063031	1063891	You keep doing it.
1079130	1081071	We do fail at it, you just don't notice.
1082111	1086473	Okay, this is my opinion, and this is from doing my show in this too.
1087073	1093556	I think I'm fucking up every episode, okay, but after a while, you know, people are like, oh, that was fun, that was fun.
1093576	1094477	I'm like, it was?
1095217	1097738	And so you just keep doing it until enough people tell you that it's fine.
1098644	1113656	for me and this might be a weird thing to bring up but some people go to church every Sunday night and they make it a habit and they do it every single week and I'm not a religious person and really my religion is not the listeners business anyway but you know this in a way is kind of
1114236	1114457	I did.
1114477	1115237	I missed episode two.
1133680	1134581	You make a lot of shows.
1134601	1135602	But I'll tell you this.
1135642	1138564	I've been listening since you did the part A, part B thing.
1138584	1139045	Follow me.
1161042	1163843	Well, we really appreciate it, Raven Stauffen.
1163983	1164843	Oh, oh.
1165023	1165223	Yeah?
1165964	1167444	They want me to say this line.
1167484	1168044	Should I say it?
1168444	1169225	All right, go for it.
1170085	1170785	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
1172005	1172706	Okay.
1173286	1174066	It's an inside joke.
1174126	1174906	All right, thanks, Raven Stauffen.
1174926	1175727	We've got to let you go, buddy.
1175747	1175907	Bye.
1176207	1176427	Bye.
1177627	1179088	Yeah, we've got to keep each call to like five minutes.
1179108	1179648	It's Loki's turn.
1179668	1180468	We've got a lot of calls tonight.
1180488	1182009	All right, Loki, you get to answer this call.
1182069	1182369	Let's see.
1182409	1183209	Who am I going to let you answer?
1183229	1183689	How about this one?
1184869	1186310	Hey, who is this?
1189718	1190278	It's Airman.
1190379	1191299	It's a crank call.
1192840	1193360	Is somebody there?
1195641	1196541	Hello.
1197122	1198122	Frickin' crank calls.
1198262	1200183	All right, Loki, you don't get out of it that easy.
1200203	1200883	You get another call.
1200923	1201564	Here you go, Loki.
1202344	1203525	You get this call instead.
1204445	1204565	Ah!
1206126	1206806	Loki, you get this one.
1207547	1208087	I get three calls.
1208787	1209968	Hi, this is Orange Lunch Radio.
1210008	1210388	Who is this?
1211188	1211749	Hey, what's up, guys?
1211769	1213589	It's the Rob D. Hey, how's it going?
1214290	1214910	Not too shabby.
1215350	1217571	Gotta congratulate you on the 500th episode, obviously.
1217991	1218492	Well, thank you.
1218792	1219112	Well done.
1220063	1223424	What are the most disturbing trends you've seen in gaming, and what is the best trend you've seen in gaming?
1223444	1226785	I have an answer for this, but I'll let you guys go first, or if you want to think, I'll...
1249321	1251341	Most disturbing trends in gaming?
1251741	1252922	The baby stage of Parappa?
1254202	1256102	No, I haven't played that, so I don't know.
1256862	1269125	No, I would say probably the most disturbing trend in game is this, like, I don't know, focus on, I guess, a lot of the games seem to be repeating themselves.
1269185	1269645	Sequels.
1270645	1276746	Too many sequels, or even better, too many fucking spin-off games, like Square, let's see.
1277369	1281270	Perfect example, Final Fantasy VII should only be one game.
1281630	1282771	It's Final Fantasy VII.
1282811	1287232	We don't need Final Fantasy VII, A, B, C, D, E, so on.
1287612	1288392	That's annoying.
1288812	1299636	Also, this whole thing with violent video games and people targeting stuff, I don't think video games are that much more violent than they were years ago.
1299676	1301076	It's just the technology has gotten better.
1302016	1303717	The way that they're displayed is more graphic.
1304681	1307484	and more mainstream.
1307524	1310566	You've got people finally realizing that games aren't just for kids.
1311066	1313588	I attribute it to society getting wimpier.
1315330	1318492	I think that people are getting more coddled.
1319333	1327519	For example, when we were kids, who played tetherball and who had metal jungle gyms at school?
1328200	1328820	Yeah, we had that.
1329341	1329961	Now what are they?
1330101	1331722	Plastic and no tetherball.
1331822	1332323	What the hell?
1333380	1334641	Thank you for watching!
1348149	1351952	We were sort of raised in the, oh, well, kids got to take their bumps, right?
1352333	1358778	You're not going to learn not to fall off the swing set if you don't fall off the swing set once to find out that the ground is hard, you know?
1359779	1364443	And now parents are like, oh, we need to protect them from all this and blah, blah, blah.
1364503	1366684	Let's raise a society of wimpy asses.
1367325	1367885	You know what?
1368126	1369747	Part of being a child is learning.
1370568	1371008	Is learning.
1371128	1371388	That's it.
1371488	1372029	Is learning.
1372709	1374211	Part of being, you know...
1375054	1375574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1399577	1400737	Wow, that was kind of deep.
1401298	1405459	I was going to say, my most disturbing trend is bad ports.
1406860	1409601	Ubisoft, Wii, end of case.
1411682	1413862	EA, first generation 360 games.
1414843	1415323	There you go.
1415703	1418544	Bad fucking ports is the most disturbing trend in gaming.
1418684	1420625	Most Wii games?
1420705	1422826	Best trend in gaming real quick, then we'll let Rob D. give his answers.
1422886	1423586	Best trend in gaming.
1423866	1428728	Best trend in gaming, I would say multiplayer and downloadable content.
1430256	1431881	I have to say bizarre indie games.
1433987	1435412	With the exception of Irritating Stick.
1437590	1442314	I'm going to give the big three each one, because I do like that the big three each have something going for them.
1442655	1445077	Nintendo, innovation and control style.
1445497	1448459	Say what you will about the Wii being a one-stop shop.
1448860	1452263	It's really turned a lot of people on to gaming who weren't there before, so yay Nintendo.
1452583	1456686	Microsoft, Xbox Live, king of online gaming, undisputed champion.
1457067	1460650	Sony, hard to say so far, but home...
1461613	1463634	looks very innovative as well and could be very cool.
1463774	1470836	So, depending on that, but certainly not the brown-eyed judgment, which also would be my runner-up for worst trend in gaming is cameras.
1472336	1475017	I mean, it's a brilliant idea, but nobody's used it well yet.
1475277	1475658	Nobody.
1477078	1477858	Rob D., what do you think?
1478899	1482780	Well, my best trend in gaming, I'm going to have to agree with Loki and Sky on this one, definitely.
1483060	1486201	Xbox Live and the rise of online gaming on consoles.
1486781	1489442	With the online community I've seen and taken part in and
1490238	1492439	and the Xbox 360.
1492559	1493240	It's a wonderful thing.
1493340	1494540	There's just no two ways about it.
1495180	1497241	I swear to God I'll be there for Hold'em eventually.
1498862	1500663	I'll hold you to that.
1500763	1501583	Worst trend in gaming?
1502684	1517491	I actually have to go the opposite route of DarkSakura because I really think that a lot of publishers are being pushed in a direction to squash some games that may or may not sell well or that people these analysts may think won't sell well.
1519207	1524730	And on the DS, there are more independent games and there are some companies more willing to take a chance.
1524790	1533794	But when you see these development costs rising and rising so much on these next-gen systems, a lot of games don't necessarily get to be released.
1535335	1535795	And it's a shame.
1537276	1537536	All right.
1537636	1538536	Well, there you have it.
1538936	1540377	So rising development costs.
1541618	1543138	Remember when games were made by one dude?
1545716	1549197	Some of those Atari 2600 games were made by one dude.
1550277	1552858	And now they're like multi-million dollar productions.
1553078	1553938	But they don't have to be.
1554138	1557719	I mean, they don't really have to be to be successful games.
1557759	1558159	That's the thing.
1558220	1567742	People, especially publishers and developers, are kind of under this impression that they need to really push the envelope as far as realism in games, and that's not necessarily the case.
1568002	1571143	I mean, you don't need to be realistic in order to be a good game.
1571929	1587652	BlackWolfInChat, excellent point Ultima was made by one dude now the original Ultima is for me not that incredible of a game but the trend that it started huge so anyway Remember Adventure on the 2600?
1588672	1591692	Made by one guy Isn't that phenomenal?
1592112	1593033	Isn't that phenomenal?
1593173	1593753	Adventure?
1594013	1601134	Think about how many hours you spend on a game like Adventure Just phenomenal RobD we gotta wrap it up and let some more people through but any last thoughts?
1602206	1602566	Not really.
1602767	1603847	That's all I got for you guys.
1603907	1609110	Thanks for taking my call, and I hope you guys go for another, well, five years if you want to, I should say that.
1609510	1610351	We'll try our best.
1610371	1612732	If you don't want to, then you've got to stop at that point.
1613172	1616394	And if you want to hear more of the Rob D, as you should, he's a great radio host.
1616414	1618476	You really do have a voice for radio, Rob D. It's amazing.
1618796	1620457	tdig.allgames.com.
1620937	1621257	Check it out.
1621277	1621617	Exactly.
1621637	1622378	Just stay in gaming.
1622538	1624639	When I'm done with pimping, enjoy the rest of your show.
1624759	1625019	All right.
1625059	1626200	Have a good one, Rob D. Appreciate it.
1627987	1629228	My turn to take a call.
1629328	1630069	Let's go.
1630189	1633351	I'm going to go to a telephone call and see how that one turns out.
1633411	1633972	Let's do this one.
1634412	1635493	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
1635513	1635833	Who's this?
1637374	1638295	Hey, this is Scott.
1638535	1639916	I mean, this is Yuri Lover.
1640197	1641137	Hi, Yuri Lover.
1641398	1642078	Hey, good.
1642118	1642819	How are you?
1643879	1644200	I'm good.
1644240	1645401	Hey, DarkSakura.
1645461	1646181	Hey, Loki.
1646201	1650284	I just want to say congrats on a big five.
1650765	1651105	All right?
1651706	1651966	Thank you.
1651986	1653327	You'll be starting kindergarten soon.
1654690	1661393	We were in preschool already, and now we're this many.
1663874	1669236	Now, Olar, did Uncle touch you in the no-no area at all?
1670256	1670636	Did they?
1670796	1671117	Did he?
1671497	1679840	No, but Loki's been kind of messing with my mind over the past couple years, so I guess there's that.
1683034	1684676	Talk about games for Christ's sake.
1684696	1685917	What do you want to say about games?
1685957	1687558	I was going to get to that.
1687618	1691422	I was going to get to some great gaming affairs.
1694205	1696307	Some great gaming affairs that I know of.
1696327	1702874	EA and Westwood, Maxis, and every other goddamn company bought out by EA.
1705622	1706924	Me and your mom last night.
1710487	1713389	Microsoft and Namco.
1713610	1714651	Apple and Nintendo.
1714811	1717773	And OR and GameTap.
1718214	1719895	Why you gotta cheat on me?
1720175	1720496	Why?
1721056	1722798	Why you gotta cheat on me with GameTap?
1723635	1726617	What do you think has been a great partnership and what do you think has been a bad partnership?
1726637	1727878	Does anybody want to try and answer this one?
1727918	1728298	EA and anybody?
1728318	1729258	Has it been a bad partnership?
1729278	1729559	I don't know.
1729579	1729619	Oh.
1754480	1756481	I think that's a bad partnership, yes.
1756601	1759162	I think they just ruined the Command & Conquer series.
1759242	1759762	Alright, why?
1759802	1761403	Oh, is it because they ruined Command & Conquer?
1761623	1766905	I think the He Who Shall Not Be Named and Law is a bad combination.
1766965	1768966	Lord Voldemort and the Study of Law?
1768986	1770246	No, He Who Shall Not Be Named.
1770386	1771067	No, not Voldemort!
1771207	1771927	Not Voldemort!
1772107	1772387	No!
1774068	1776649	Just... No, I'm not going to say it on air.
1776909	1780150	I would say a bad partnership...
1781815	1784276	was Nintendo and Sony.
1785656	1787397	Actually, no, that might have been a good partnership.
1787457	1789517	Oh my God, the PlayStation one on the net?
1789877	1791438	Yeah, the whole PlayStation one.
1791938	1792458	Oh, wow.
1792498	1799260	If you think about it, though, I mean, maybe not, because maybe that was actually a good partnership, because if that hadn't happened, maybe the PlayStation would have never come out.
1799927	1804650	So, and that way, you know, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 certainly have changed the face of gaming.
1804710	1806372	So maybe that was actually a good partnership.
1806412	1808033	So maybe that's not fair for me to say.
1808313	1808873	How about this?
1809414	1810514	Bad partnership.
1810655	1811995	Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
1812036	1813396	What the fuck were you thinking of partnership?
1814137	1815938	Philips, CD-i, and Nintendo.
1817760	1818200	There you go.
1818280	1819601	Everybody can agree that was bad.
1819861	1824064	Or what was it that, no, it was the CD-i that was playing Sega CD games, wasn't it?
1826938	1838282	I can tell you one, I think, if it ever happened.
1838842	1841282	Sega and Microsoft with the original Xbox.
1842263	1848044	How there were rumors going around that the Dreamcast was going to be on the Xbox, or the Dreamcast games were going to be playable.
1848284	1850505	Some of them made it, well, in different ways.
1853389	1879508	I would have loved to have like guitar here or popping music on my Xbox or something I would say a good partnership has been Square and Enix I think a lot of people had a lot to fear from that merger but you know the momentum hasn't really stopped and there's been a lot of really good games that have come out of those companies Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest VIII you know we still see a lot of good stuff granted Loki's problem with sequels they do have that problem the laser active that's what it was sorry
1881660	1884081	Bad Partnerships, so far at least.
1884301	1885782	Konami and Hudson, actually.
1886142	1890805	Because to be honest, Hudson, everything from that division has really sucked lately.
1891725	1894106	Bomberman, you know, Act Zero.
1895607	1897268	That game doesn't exist in my universe.
1897688	1899729	You know, I don't know.
1900830	1906333	Hudson, I mean, they've got some good things going for them, but I know they love Bomberman.
1906353	1907973	Okay, great.
1908394	1909654	But let's get past Bomberman.
1909954	1910675	Let that series...
1911371	1913452	Take a rest for a few years, you know.
1914072	1916733	You don't need to release a new Bomberman title every fucking year.
1916793	1918554	Well, the Xbox Live Arcade one looks pretty good.
1919094	1919655	I'll let him have that.
1919675	1921876	Well, hey, how about positivity?
1921916	1923456	What about the good partnerships?
1923816	1924517	Square Enix!
1924977	1925357	Well, yeah.
1926518	1933481	I actually was going to say, this is an old one, but Bleem and Sega.
1934361	1936722	Even though Sega didn't really have any authority over it.
1937542	1938023	Bleemcast.
1939853	1940473	Good times.
1940614	1942535	You got playing the PlayStation games on the Dreamcast?
1942855	1953402	It was only certain ones, but keep in mind, I am the biggest Tekken fangirl ever, and Tekken 3 on Bleemcast was better than the arcade.
1953482	1954182	It was beautiful.
1954343	1956324	I was like, hell yeah, take me now.
1959206	1961507	All right, Yuri Lever, what about you?
1961647	1962568	Anything you want to add to this?
1965063	1969149	Not really, but I just want to say congrats again.
1970191	1977983	My parents are sort of getting pissed off right now because I'm talking on the phone to total strangers, is what they think.
1978023	1979345	They don't get much stranger than Rob.
1979944	1980184	All right.
1980445	1982506	Well, we're sorry, Mom, and we're sorry, Dad.
1982606	1984508	And, yeah, so we'll have a good one.
1984528	1984888	We'll hang out.
1984908	1985249	Oh, don't worry.
1985289	1986189	It's my dad's birthday.
1986450	1987971	He'll just get pissed off tomorrow.
1987991	1989092	Well, he's got a good birthday then.
1989172	1989732	Happy birthday.
1990153	1990393	All right.
1990893	1991053	Yeah.
1991074	1991534	All right.
1991554	1992815	We'll see you later, you're a lover.
1992855	1994536	One more thing.
1994757	1996178	Do your parents know you're a yearly lover?
1998300	1999981	They don't know what it means.
2000101	2000541	Oh, I get it.
2000562	2001142	Okay, never mind then.
2001182	2001803	One more thing, yes.
2002003	2003404	It just means that you like snow.
2003964	2005185	No, not snow.
2005426	2006987	You like lilies.
2007027	2008148	Let him have his one more thing, yes.
2010532	2011432	ResTrans Vibrator.
2013573	2016234	Best peripheral ever, ResTrans Vibrator.
2017774	2018375	Yeah, it is.
2018395	2019615	Until 3Feel comes out, yes.
2019635	2019995	All through.
2021055	2021396	All right.
2022056	2022936	See you later, Yuri Lever.
2022956	2023516	Thanks for the call.
2023556	2024937	Have a good one.
2024977	2030639	Hey, Rob, before we take a call, I have to tell you about something that someone reminded me of in the chat room.
2030679	2030959	What's that?
2031319	2037601	Dan found a YouTube video of someone using the Mugen emulator to put the R-Type ship into Super Mario Bros.,
2038784	2040446	and played through the first level of Super Mario Bros.
2040466	2041266	with the ship from R-Type.
2041406	2042007	That's awesome.
2042347	2043848	Anyway, I'm going to answer this one.
2044048	2044849	Let's do some more calls.
2044869	2046390	Are you going to do email bag tonight?
2046430	2047832	Yeah, I am, but I need to answer this.
2047872	2048592	Let's do some more calls.
2048692	2049833	All right, we'll let you take a call here.
2050794	2051154	What?
2052896	2054137	Hi.
2054717	2056118	Hi.
2057139	2058060	I fear the Jamie.
2058100	2058920	This is Junami.
2061442	2061803	I know.
2061823	2061863	Hi.
2062724	2063904	How are you?
2063924	2064925	You don't sound like yourself.
2066206	2067708	Maybe because you screamed in his ear.
2067768	2068168	I don't know.
2068962	2070183	Yeah, I think that was it.
2071504	2072184	What do you want?
2073185	2075846	I'm just saying hi and happy fucking birthday.
2076547	2078188	Yeah, we're going to Sack Anime, right?
2078788	2079308	Yeah, we are.
2079709	2080329	When is that again?
2081090	2082771	That is middle of July.
2082791	2084792	I believe it's July 14th and 15th.
2084892	2085892	We are so there.
2086013	2087313	On SackAnime.com.
2087353	2088494	You're going to cosplay with me, right?
2089615	2091896	Uh, I might if I can, uh... Nerds!
2092236	2093437	Fucking nerds!
2093517	2094898	Rob, you know what?
2095458	2095598	Ah!
2096679	2097960	Did we ever get a panel on that?
2098644	2099024	I don't know.
2099365	2100766	Explicit was looking into it for us.
2101666	2103187	To do a panel at SAK Anime.
2104408	2104989	So what do you want?
2105009	2106730	Somewhere in the basement of the Scottish Rite.
2106750	2107731	You've got to have a topic.
2108551	2109452	I'll give you a topic.
2109512	2112214	Gothic architecture is neither gothic nor architecture.
2112294	2113034	Discuss.
2114916	2116077	I don't have any arches.
2116137	2116897	I have flat feet.
2117658	2119579	Drew, you've been a long time listener of Orange Lounge Radio.
2120600	2122121	Best thing that ever happened on this program?
2124623	2126704	I'd have to say episode 69.
2129244	2131486	I feel bad because Jamie wasn't there for that.
2131846	2133487	Is that the weekend I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room?
2133507	2135709	Why do you think it was the best moment?
2135729	2135829	What?
2135849	2136730	Did you hear what Drew said?
2136770	2138191	He said, why do you think it was the best one?
2139532	2141013	I know where you live.
2141874	2142434	Yes, you do.
2142494	2143615	Maybe you could give me a ride home.
2143795	2147097	Okay, here's the story behind episode 69.
2147318	2153002	Jamie was gone for a week and our friend Janae came on the program.
2153462	2156785	And Janae was having fun with it because she thought... The mistress.
2156925	2158466	She thought it was a phone sex line.
2158886	2162088	So, and the fact that it was episode number 69 didn't help any.
2162488	2167752	So it was episode 69, and that's when Karaoke Revolution, the very first one, was brand new.
2168172	2172855	And back in the day, we used to fuck off so bad on the program.
2172895	2174336	Like, we didn't have these set topics.
2174636	2177318	I mean, every program was kind of like tonight, in a way.
2177438	2179299	It was the three-hour tour.
2179640	2180220	Exactly.
2180520	2182381	And it's so weird how we've become organized since then.
2182401	2184943	Wait, wait, wait, wait, we're organized?
2184963	2185043	Yeah.
2185083	2185503	and someone.
2186223	2187144	When did this come about?
2187244	2189124	Karaoke Revolution got broken out.
2189244	2194866	Loki gave his most infamous performance that in some ways has scared him off from ever doing karaoke again.
2195186	2198388	So I ask Loki, is episode 69 to blame for your fear of karaoke?
2198788	2200808	I just hate karaoke and I don't know why I did it.
2200848	2202269	You made me do it last time.
2203029	2204250	Karaoke hates you.
2204830	2208791	I told him he was kicked out of the apartment if you wouldn't do karaoke or something.
2209231	2210452	I don't remember what it was.
2210952	2211732	I did it twice.
2211852	2213913	We're going to pick the song at random.
2215354	2215874	Great.
2216274	2220295	And then of course he changed the lyrics to I'm coming out to I'm staying in.
2220735	2222216	I like the pussy or something like that.
2222236	2223436	It was so freaking funny.
2224016	2225357	We were peeing ourselves laughing.
2225917	2228137	I'm sure there's a bootleg clip floating around somewhere.
2228277	2231678	That's what I need to send to Scott for the all-game soundboard.
2232379	2234339	I've got the MP3s.
2234539	2234899	Do you?
2235299	2236440	But I'm not sharing.
2238900	2239941	All right, Drew.
2240181	2241281	We had milkshakes.
2242684	2247326	and I believe that was the episode that Milkshake won the cage match.
2247727	2249367	I gotta run for just a minute because the food's here.
2249428	2250608	Matt, please take over, Jamie.
2250948	2252229	Food!
2252469	2253610	I know, God.
2253850	2255431	I could really use some pizza right now.
2256432	2257112	I've got pizza.
2257232	2259293	I don't get any pizza because I'm on the floor.
2259754	2260594	Ha ha!
2261114	2261975	Floor for you.
2262335	2263136	No pizza.
2263176	2265037	Wait, it was Loki on the floor that time.
2265817	2266738	Dude, okay.
2267878	2270520	I think that we should have the official Orange Lounge Radio barbecue.
2271517	2274099	Yeah, good idea.
2274799	2275580	Glad I thought of it.
2276520	2277561	I am not high.
2278261	2279022	No, you're drunk.
2279042	2279742	Damn, I am not high.
2280263	2280803	I'm just me.
2281643	2282164	You're drunk.
2283565	2284705	Okay, fine, I'm drunk.
2284745	2285226	You got me.
2286626	2288568	Just because I have corrupted you.
2288628	2289929	I have good beer this time.
2290789	2291209	What do you have?
2291229	2292010	Tell me what you're drinking.
2292690	2295732	I have Arrogant Bastard IPA.
2296993	2298954	Not bad, however, I can do you better.
2298974	2300275	I've got Guinness in the fridge at home.
2301673	2303815	And I'm never buying cheap champagne again.
2303936	2305397	Oh my god, this stuff went right to my head.
2306939	2308180	Should I mail you some waffles?
2309241	2311224	No, dammit, I don't need waffles.
2312265	2313606	Waffles, waffles.
2313646	2314948	I paid you back your waffles, didn't I?
2315508	2316449	Yeah, a long time ago.
2316890	2318071	Okay, I forgot.
2319132	2320514	Rob needs to bring us our pizza!
2321996	2322857	Waffles.
2326395	2328417	Dude, I could actually go for waffles instead.
2328817	2330458	I could go for pancakes right now, okay?
2331119	2333500	So, okay, tell us something relevant.
2333540	2341946	Like, talk about what do you think in the past five years of our show you think the best game released has been?
2341986	2345068	The most innovative game of the year type game.
2346409	2347570	Katamari Damacy.
2348111	2348851	Why do you feel this way?
2348871	2349712	No contest.
2350772	2351173	Food!
2351193	2353014	Oh my god, food.
2354235	2355296	Okay, I'm not talking to you anymore.
2355316	2355816	There's food here.
2357016	2357677	I see how it is.
2357737	2358818	I see where your priorities are.
2371621	2372501	Watch it be the wrong pizza.
2372561	2373662	Hey, they give you coupons.
2373682	2374742	They never give me coupons.
2374762	2374982	I know.
2375262	2375683	I'm special.
2375723	2378504	Now everyone is on the floor for pizza that reminds me of number 29.
2379304	2379564	All right.
2379964	2382746	Drew, we got to let you go because we have a bunch of other calls coming in.
2383386	2383766	All right.
2383966	2384206	All right.
2384346	2384786	Take care.
2384806	2385187	Oh, no.
2385207	2385907	Vagina puppies.
2386647	2387007	Shut up.
2387147	2387447	Bye.
2388048	2388568	Objection.
2390569	2391149	What a nerd.
2391689	2391929	All right.
2391969	2392730	Who's answering this call?
2392770	2393690	Loki, it's your turn, right?
2394430	2394790	Yes.
2394890	2395131	All right.
2395171	2395751	Then answer this one.
2395831	2396171	This one.
2399076	2400677	Hello, Vacuum Cleaner, how's it going?
2400977	2402458	Holy shit, what's that?
2402478	2406779	I don't want to know.
2406899	2407700	That was not good.
2408960	2409981	I don't want to know what they're doing.
2410101	2413843	Whoever just called us, please give us a call back a little later.
2414183	2420385	When you've called, Echo123 is what you want to call to always make sure that your internet connection is working.
2420485	2421026	And cleaned up.
2421046	2422546	You don't sound like Vacuum Cleaner.
2422987	2424367	No problem, it happens, dude.
2424447	2424987	No problem.
2425388	2427128	All right, Loki, how about you try this one instead?
2428249	2428509	Okay.
2428529	2428609	Okay.
2428834	2429594	Hello, who is this?
2431496	2434878	Hello, this is Insanus reporting live from Duck Island.
2435658	2436338	Duck Island?
2438300	2438840	How's it going?
2439480	2440601	It's going well.
2440841	2443102	Congratulations on five years, guys.
2444283	2444643	Thank you.
2445784	2447885	I'm going to celebrate by taking pizza.
2448205	2449646	What the crap is Duck Island?
2450727	2451647	You don't remember that?
2452028	2452268	No.
2453729	2454109	Okay.
2454129	2454209	Okay.
2455200	2460245	Remember the show where I was absolutely on a drunken rampage in the chat room?
2460465	2460965	Oh, yeah.
2461165	2462086	Okay, now I remember.
2462306	2462587	I do.
2463367	2471334	And a certain individual, who will not be named Rob, asked if I've ever been to Duck Island.
2474397	2476939	And I responded with, your mom goes to Duck Island.
2477059	2479361	And Rob laughed like a silly little girl.
2479622	2480062	Yeah, I know.
2480102	2480823	I do that sometimes.
2480843	2482144	All right, what do you want to talk to us about?
2483734	2488999	Well, you guys were talking about good ideas like with companies merging or working together.
2489579	2495724	You guys missed a really obvious one, Harmonix and Red Octane with the whole Guitar Hero thing.
2495764	2500869	I mean, honestly, that's probably been one of the biggest game franchises in the past two years.
2501149	2501909	You're getting a little quieter.
2501949	2503070	Put your mouth closer to the microphone.
2503090	2505532	But yes, dude, you're right.
2505873	2509235	It's really been kind of one of the first partnerships to give Konami a run for its money too.
2509656	2510036	And you know what?
2510096	2512278	Competition in some ways is a good thing, honestly.
2514160	2514800	Is this better?
2515561	2516181	Yes, much better.
2516741	2517081	Okay.
2519522	2522883	I was just calling to say congratulations on five years.
2522963	2524123	Here's to five more.
2526324	2528745	I hope my show lasts five months.
2532606	2534747	Well, how long has your show been going?
2535767	2537148	Now, you're starting this new show, right?
2538008	2538668	It's on.
2538728	2540929	It's going to be episode four this week.
2542199	2542819	Good job.
2542879	2544420	And what do you talk about on your show?
2544821	2550964	We talk about absolutely nothing, so it's pretty much like your show was back in the day, I would take it.
2551285	2551685	Good times.
2551705	2552986	I'm glad somebody's picking up the slack.
2553886	2558949	Yeah, I have to because, you know, I'm the big retarded kid of Orange Lounge Radio.
2560570	2560910	All right.
2561151	2563292	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
2565333	2566834	Not anything that would get me fired.
2568895	2569295	All right.
2569496	2569996	Good times.
2570822	2571862	Alright, I love you guys.
2572163	2573543	I love you too, DMN.
2573963	2574663	Don't get too drunk.
2575104	2575464	We'll try.
2576364	2576944	Alright, later.
2576964	2577865	Alright, have a good one, DMN.
2579865	2583407	Speaking of, DMN brings up a good point I want to ask you guys about really quick.
2583447	2586768	What do you think have been some of the best guests we've ever had on Orange Lounge Radio?
2588189	2589609	Because, you know, DMN was here once.
2589649	2591470	We've had a lot of people in and out of this house.
2591710	2593831	What do you guys think were some of the best guests we've ever had on the program?
2596312	2596872	Abe Lincoln.
2599313	2599613	Me.
2599633	2599673	Me.
2600461	2601162	and my ego.
2602863	2605145	My favorite guest ever has been Sauce.
2606626	2607327	And the lesbians.
2607807	2610069	I think the lesbians have been some of the best guests we've ever had.
2610489	2611570	Sauce is the best guest.
2612011	2613452	We have a lot of good women that come on the show.
2613512	2614252	Nothing against the men.
2614593	2619897	I'd have to say the top three have been Tiara and Kristen and Megzi.
2620518	2621018	Awesome times.
2621974	2622434	Hey, this is Scott.
2622454	2623075	How are you guys doing?
2623095	2624035	Congratulations on five years.
2624055	2625196	This is Scott from All Games?
2643706	2651668	Well, you know, I've been listening to the show, and I've been hearing a lot of people who seem to just be calling in to wishing you congratulations just to plug their podcast.
2651789	2653529	I don't really want to mention where I'm from.
2654109	2655830	I just want to make this about you.
2655970	2657990	Every call, it's like, hey, I do a podcast.
2658271	2661071	Hey, I want to give a shout-out on my podcast.
2661271	2661612	You know what?
2661632	2667453	This is about you three and this show, and it doesn't matter what I do or where I come from, okay?
2667473	2670474	I appreciate that, but isn't it funny?
2670494	2672775	Hey, there's the best guest on our show right there.
2673829	2682452	I only got two letters from attorneys after that appearance so apparently Orange Lounge Radio not only feeds information about games not released but it feeds information to legal counsel over at G4 I would know nothing about that sir
2702147	2713471	Well, I'm asking you because we're just kind of talking about, you know, random stuff in gaming and kind of the gaming scene is that, you know, you kind of bring up a good point that everybody and their brother and sister have a podcast in this day and age.
2713491	2716613	Because you're right, a lot of people have been calling in and plugging their stuff, which is fine.
2716653	2720634	We're all about promoting the indie podcast and I know you guys at All Games are really big on that.
2721034	2728117	But what do you think can really help a podcast kind of like distinguish itself amongst all the rest out there?
2729281	2734826	I mean, do something that no one else is doing and usually that'll work when you're doing something that you're passionate about.
2734866	2756905	I think you guys hit it on the head when you started out being about Benami because that was what you were passionate about but as you got more comfortable doing your shows, you kind of showed everyone that, hey, not only are we passionate about that but we're passionate about a lot of other things and that's how you kind of expand your show and you get to talk about more varied things but I think to start out,
2757589	2761670	You've got to start out with something that you're passionate about and something that no one else is talking about.
2761710	2768172	If you happen to be into the same stuff that everybody else is into, you can still do it, but try and come at it from a different angle.
2769533	2770853	Do something different with it.
2771073	2771493	Right.
2771513	2771774	Go ahead.
2780444	2783966	Well, I had a couple of toasts I wanted to give to you guys.
2783986	2785126	I don't know if you want me to wait for that?
2785387	2786407	No, go for it.
2786467	2788128	I've got my champagne glass in my hand.
2788188	2788568	Go for it.
2788588	2790429	I drank all my booze already, so here's some Coke.
2790609	2790910	All right.
2791290	2792050	What's the toast?
2792851	2795172	Okay, do a line up of guys back if you're doing Coke.
2795232	2796733	Okay.
2797633	2806298	Being a podcaster, I know that you guys, just like we, don't always get respect from people in the industry, so this first toast addresses that.
2806838	2808759	Here's to the game developers we love.
2809249	2811230	Here's to the game developers who love us.
2811671	2816374	The developers we love will never love us, so fuck those developers, and here's to us.
2816794	2818095	All right, good call.
2818155	2818875	I like that one.
2819015	2819656	That is great.
2820536	2824119	Okay, and then I have a little haiku, because I know how much you love haikus.
2824199	2825200	I do love haikus.
2826160	2826801	Okay, here we go.
2828522	2832905	And I hope I don't screw this up, because usually Sky corrects my... It's 575, Sky, 575.
2832985	2833205	Yeah.
2837177	2844144	Loki, Jamie, Sky, A Sunday Night Tradition, Lesbians Are Hot.
2846747	2848929	I'll drink to that.
2848989	2850351	Lesbians are indeed hot.
2850531	2852333	I might be gay, but I love my lesbians.
2852793	2857078	I'll save my last one for right before I hang up.
2857098	2858219	Is there anything else you wanted to...
2859463	2862164	Ask me or can I just give you guys some more love?
2862244	2862524	I do.
2862584	2863464	Well, really, really quick.
2863544	2871105	I just want to ask you a question because I know a lot of folks kind of know you as that guy that was on G4 a long time ago and all that stuff.
2871445	2882247	But I kind of rely on that experience that you've had kind of at the far end of this industry, kind of like where gaming media can go, kind of like all the way to the top, so to speak.
2882627	2886808	I kind of ask, is it possible that gaming can ever –
2887643	2890264	substantiate that type of media again?
2890284	2894185	Will we ever have a true gaming channel in the future, in the next five years, do you think?
2895466	2901187	I think the problem is that it's going to be difficult for anyone to sustain a channel.
2901207	2903088	It doesn't matter if it's games or anything else.
2903128	2915972	I mean, if you look at what's happening now as everything moves to the Internet, IPTV and broadband and Fios, and if you look at game trailers and IGN and GameSpot, they're essentially networks.
2916802	2917543	about games.
2917843	2922445	They're just done in a way that this, I think, audience wants to consume it.
2922505	2929650	The problem with a regular television channel is that people aren't watching regular television anymore, especially gamers.
2929690	2931311	They're getting all their content online.
2931331	2933232	They're getting it when they want it, how they want it.
2933672	2941356	And the model for reaching that audience just may not be the traditional cable TV model.
2941677	2942437	If you notice what's
2942751	2966718	Spike TV and what G4 has done is they're casting their net to this wider demographic because I think that once you try to just get gamers on a TV level, there's a belief, not necessarily that it's true, but there's a belief by both the ad community and the executives in television that that group, the gamer group, isn't big enough.
2967298	2970499	You know and I know there's 150 million Americans, there's 800 million Americans,
2972066	2973147	and gamers around the world.
2973587	2986897	But I think when someone doesn't understand games and they don't know games and they don't play games, it's difficult for them to believe that the audience is there and that it's big enough to support a big television network.
2987177	2989659	I think the way it's going to happen is it's going to be online.
2989699	2995864	I don't think we'll ever see a traditional television network that's ad-supported doing it because I just don't think that
2996283	2998865	within the age of 500 channels that there's enough.
2998925	3016799	Now, subscription, maybe, like Gameplay HD and VOOM, I believe that if they're committed to keeping that channel of subscription as part of an overall, not an individual subscription, but an overall HD package, that channel should succeed because, again, it's not reliant on viewers and rating.
3017159	3022183	It's reliant on the overall company, Rainbow Media and VOOM,
3022897	3026720	and being committed to niche programming on HD satellites.
3026740	3030422	So I think Gameplay HD is the best chance for a major network.
3030502	3032824	It just actually got picked up by Cablevision.
3032864	3034825	So I don't have different networks.
3034865	3036446	Cablevision is now carrying it as well.
3036626	3037066	Very good.
3037106	3040268	So it's Gameplay HD or it's YouTube for the rest of us?
3040509	3041009	Pretty much.
3042110	3042330	All right.
3042370	3043751	Anything else you wanted to share with us?
3044551	3048854	There's always all games because, you know, today audio, tomorrow video.
3048894	3050415	We're working on getting our own location.
3050916	3061205	and we'll be doing video every day as soon as we get that place up and running and of course I'm very excited for the day that you guys all come down to our place and christen the new location because
3061973	3067677	as the ashes of Arena fall, so will a new event rise in the heart of Hollywood with all games.
3087869	3093252	It's funny seeing a station like that, not so dedicated to games, still getting invited to E3.
3093332	3095414	I'm sure Scott's sick of hearing about G4.
3096154	3099636	It's not even about them getting invited.
3099796	3106420	It's about them spending money to try and appease the few gaming audience members they have left.
3106460	3109362	They basically siphoned off all the money they were spending on games.
3109382	3115125	They got it down to X-Play and a little bit of Attack of the Show and a Cinematek rip-off thing.
3115838	3144178	but really it's not about E3 letting them in it's about G4 trying to keep those gamers because let's face it I know you know it the majority of people that still watch G4 even though it's a very small slice of people in the world of cable it's still the gamers nobody is showing up for cops and cheaters and all that crap I don't know I show up for cheaters it's all about the few remaining gamers who are holding out that maybe someday there will be a resurgence but
3145068	3146069	It's not going to happen.
3146369	3153375	Their E3 coverage will probably be okay because they'll have Jeff Keighley and Adam and Morgan, but that's about it.
3153515	3154936	And then lots of women in bikinis.
3155837	3158319	There it is, because that's what gamers really want.
3158359	3160420	That's what gamers and 12-year-old boys really want.
3161421	3163683	Scott, we've got to get to some more calls.
3163703	3168626	We really appreciate you calling in and everything that you do with AllGames.com and supporting the independent broadcast.
3169167	3170628	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3171864	3178650	I want to say that like you guys have already laid out for people, this is not about a money making thing.
3178971	3188921	It's not about trying to be the leader in podcasting because let's face it, it's a very fragmented industry and it's difficult to stand out.
3188961	3192124	The only thing that can allow you to stand out in podcasting is your passion.
3192529	3218270	and when your passion shines through to the audience they will show up, they will reward you not with money and riches but they will reward you with the audience which is, you know, your words only work if people are there to hear them and whether it's 15 or 500 there are clearly people that love Orange Lounge Radio and they're the fuel that keep it running and it's really, it's an inspiration not only to the people that are trying to do podcasting
3219384	3244524	Right now, but to people like me Because, you know, you are the spirit of why I started doing it in the first place And so I close with this You know, Scott, you're very opinionated All three of you all have your own opinions about gaming So I love having you on our show And I love being on your show to debate So I close with this Here's to you and here's to me Podcast friends will always be But shall we ever disagree Then fuck you all and here's to me
3245185	3246246	Happy anniversary, guys.
3246466	3247807	Very well said.
3247888	3248888	Thank you so much, Scott.
3248908	3249689	Take care, buddy.
3251871	3253433	We always enjoy having Scott on the program.
3253453	3254614	He's good stuff.
3254754	3256575	That was great.
3256595	3258737	You never know who you're going to hear from here on the call-ins.
3258757	3260699	See, I really wish we lived closer to them.
3260859	3261160	I know.
3261180	3263362	It's a six-hour drive to get down there, but we're going to go.
3263782	3266404	I've heard rumblings about what they've got planned.
3266424	3267285	It sounds pretty exciting.
3267485	3268066	I'm pretty excited.
3268658	3269138	More calls?
3269338	3270999	I'm still trying to work to go to E for All.
3271619	3271899	Why not?
3271919	3274600	Or E for E. Or, you know, I could do something.
3275301	3276201	Jamie, how about one more call?
3276301	3276661	Then you can.
3277081	3278062	So take this call, Jamie.
3279102	3279482	Hi.
3281143	3281723	Whoever you are.
3281803	3282083	Hey.
3283004	3283404	What?
3284224	3285545	Dude, the Hulk is calling.
3285805	3286185	Hello?
3286265	3286465	What?
3286505	3286845	Hello?
3287586	3288506	Hey, it's Satan.
3289146	3289807	Cool.
3290247	3291647	Well, hi, Satan.
3291707	3292708	Hey, boss.
3292748	3293668	What's on your mind, Satan?
3294268	3294909	Guess what?
3295569	3295849	What?
3295949	3296209	What?
3296729	3298110	Your five years are up.
3299878	3302100	Your soul is mine now, bitches.
3302860	3304462	I had a full refund, sorry.
3305522	3307644	You know, you signed the contract.
3307704	3309125	Your soul is mine.
3309165	3314569	You'll have to talk to your secretary about that one, because, you know, that Judas does not know how to keep his paperwork straight.
3315170	3319013	Okay, don't give me any of this Enron legalese bullshit.
3319153	3321134	Your signature is on paper.
3321234	3322195	It's in blood.
3322395	3326599	Didn't you read the small print?
3326799	3329521	I have an addendum to that that's also signed in blood.
3330413	3331634	Well, Loki, new job, my right-hand man.
3331654	3333756	I need somebody with attitude and balls who doesn't give a shit.
3333816	3334617	Good job, Loki.
3358467	3360988	Yeah, but you saw the way that Namco made him cry like a little bitch.
3361028	3363289	I mean, do you really want someone like that working for you?
3364090	3369952	Now with the power of the almighty evil that is me behind him, nothing will stand in his way.
3370292	3372133	Not even a big ball of Katamari.
3372153	3372914	All right, we got you.
3373874	3375395	Answer you, Jamie.
3376495	3376895	Yes?
3377796	3384939	You will be forced to watch the series finale of SG-1 over and over and over again.
3386380	3388861	because ain't you to me, get blue balls.
3388881	3391082	There's always a start for something.
3391122	3391282	And Rob.
3391302	3391863	My dear, dear Rob.
3392163	3392443	Guess what?
3392463	3394644	Pineapple up the ass for you, bitch.
3410706	3413909	No, it's just the money I can make on pay-per-view by showing somebody sticking a pineapple up your ass.
3413929	3414409	I will rake it in.
3414429	3415009	Hey, that's my job.
3437745	3440566	I am here to lower the moral values of all programs I come in contact with.
3440626	3442886	Well, all I have to say is thank God for custom-made earplugs.
3467645	3469025	That's kind of messed up, Satan.
3469065	3471246	I mean, isn't there anything on the show you enjoy?
3471286	3475607	The pain, the pain, the pain.
3475627	3480628	This whole thing is having more fun bouncing off the walls of her cell than anybody listening to you.
3482308	3484969	You're a real jerk, Satan, and I'm about to hang up on you.
3485209	3486389	Oh, come on.
3486409	3487029	You love me.
3487049	3489410	That's why you signed the damn contract.
3489810	3491390	But you promised me Dunkin' Donuts.
3492150	3494231	Anything else, Satan, that you want to add tonight?
3497391	3502775	Let me think.
3506198	3507619	Satan, you're a real asshole, you know that?
3510741	3511221	Oh, he hung up.
3511321	3511982	Satan hung up.
3516145	3517126	Satan, you're a pig fucker.
3517686	3519007	Let's go to another call.
3519387	3520028	That was brilliant.
3520508	3521309	Loki, this one's yours.
3522530	3522950	Hello.
3523851	3524271	Who is this?
3527745	3528686	Hello?
3530527	3531368	Hello?
3531968	3532488	Who is this?
3535390	3536031	How's it going?
3537972	3539473	Hello?
3540694	3543116	God damn, do you know how many edits I'm going to have to do on tonight's show?
3543236	3545697	Because people can't get their phones to work or whatever it is.
3547298	3548499	That's alright, we forgive you.
3549240	3550341	Let's go to another call instead.
3551121	3551882	Loki, this one's yours.
3553062	3553823	Hello, who is this?
3554884	3555124	Hello?
3555204	3555304	Hello?
3556112	3556872	Legend of Zaku.
3557633	3558493	How's it going, Zaku?
3559713	3560373	Oh, pretty good.
3560393	3560914	Where's Scott?
3561114	3561574	Where's Scott?
3562834	3563174	Scott?
3563234	3564355	Sky or Scott?
3564435	3565995	Scott hung up a while ago.
3566095	3567956	Sky's right here with a mouthful of pizza.
3567996	3568596	No, Rob.
3568816	3569177	No, hi.
3569197	3569997	What's up?
3570617	3573138	Just congratulating you on five years, that's all.
3573638	3574798	Well, don't just congratulate me.
3574838	3575839	I didn't do that by myself.
3575899	3577039	Yeah, and everyone else.
3577559	3579240	The whole ORLR gang, pretty much.
3580834	3584156	Yeah, I'm just trying to wrestle, trying to get this broken monitor to work.
3584577	3594283	But yeah, a lot of things have been going on, like that whole Manhunt 2 thing, which I don't even know why.
3594303	3600928	It's just that Rockstar is kind of like, I kind of feel like they're actually pushing it too far.
3601849	3603770	I mean, I don't know.
3604071	3608353	I mean, I'm all for violence and everything, but I mean... I'm really for violence.
3608574	3610275	Yeah, you have to draw a line somewhere.
3610315	3614598	You can't go... You can't be that... You can't be too violent.
3614738	3622663	Yeah, but if I want to... I mean, this country was founded on freedom of speech and freedom of expression and freedom of... If I want to do it, shouldn't I be able to do it?
3623264	3626806	Yeah, but you also have to understand, you can do it, but...
3627520	3630811	You're going to have to face, you know, whatever reaction comes back.
3631132	3633640	That's basically you have to face the consequence of your own actions.
3634153	3636915	And that consequences people thinking you're badass.
3637255	3644920	Like if you call somebody a racial slur, even though you have the free speech to do it, that's not going to stop you from getting your ass kicked.
3645300	3652065	Yes, but that's different because that's when you are inflicting that upon someone else unwillingly and you're violating their rights.
3652545	3659650	I think it's more the difference between having the legal freedom to do something and having the moral freedom to do something.
3660591	3661031	Yeah, I guess...
3661550	3664752	Yeah, I guess it's kind of both are intertwined.
3665213	3675000	Basically, even though they have the legal right to do it, it's just, you know, obviously Nintendo or Sony or no other carrier might even pick that one up.
3675661	3678343	Maybe on PC after the whole Del Sol only thing.
3678923	3687810	But yeah, I mean, Rockstar really has to really learn how to, I don't know, just try to be violent, but
3689204	3697989	Even though you have to maintain a level of... I can't find the right word to finish it off with.
3698569	3700531	Decency.
3700711	3702452	Dude, can't we all just get along?
3702592	3707495	Can't we just kind of sit around and have some munchies and some Doritos?
3710296	3716040	But yeah, the important thing is that even though I got adult only, once it's toned down, this shit will sell crazy.
3717819	3718379	I'll tell you that.
3718620	3720561	Zach, you've been a long time listener of the show.
3720641	3724123	I know you've been listening ever since our Bomani days when we were exclusively talking about DDR.
3724903	3728726	What do you think has been the biggest story in the Bomani world that we've ever covered?
3730126	3731787	I'm not sure.
3735690	3745676	Maybe the... Hold on, let me... The whole... The whole Supernova thing...
3746414	3749516	You've managed to get first dibs on it in this country.
3750177	3753198	Did I hear like some water boiling or some bubbles blowing in the background there?
3753499	3760383	No, anyway, yeah, definitely Supernova coming back after such a long absence of DDR Extreme.
3760743	3761724	And then there was nothing.
3762064	3765547	And then finally for Supernova to come back kind of really reinvigorated us all.
3765767	3769629	And of course, Loki will be the first to tell you that he was one of the first five people in America to play it.
3770530	3771270	Right, right.
3772471	3773712	Saw you up there that day.
3774613	3774773	Yeah.
3774833	3775113	Yeah.
3776027	3779309	I mean, yeah, five years is a long time for everything to change.
3779830	3786214	You know, people coming and going, certain things changing, losing a lot, you know, we lost a lot of people.
3786234	3787975	Remember Captain Jack?
3788535	3789576	Bless his soul.
3789916	3790937	Bless his soul, that's right.
3790957	3792858	We've been doing this show for five years for Captain Jack.
3793959	3794239	Yes.
3794880	3798302	All right, well, Zaku, any other last thoughts for our listeners before we move on?
3799123	3800023	That's pretty much it.
3800423	3800744	All right.
3801124	3804226	Have a good one and smoke one for us, buddy.
3805123	3805663	I don't smoke.
3805823	3806403	I know.
3806443	3807564	I'm giving you a hard time.
3807664	3808224	Of course you don't.
3808684	3809764	How dare I insinuate that?
3810284	3810744	All right.
3810784	3811465	Have a good one, buddy.
3816026	3816706	I love Zaku.
3817326	3817986	Actually, I've met him.
3818326	3819687	He's a good kid in real life.
3819707	3821267	We give him a hard time on this show sometimes.
3821287	3823287	That's because we do that to our listeners who've called in a bunch.
3823327	3824128	Let's go to another call.
3824928	3825668	Hi, you're on Orange Lines.
3825708	3827228	Oh, we're supposed to get to your segment, huh, Jamie?
3827268	3827589	I'm sorry.
3828069	3828469	I promise.
3828489	3829989	I have to answer the one call I've been telling you to.
3830389	3830609	Okay.
3830909	3831409	We'll get a couple.
3831449	3831730	Here we go.
3832210	3833010	Hi, Orange Lines Radio.
3833030	3833330	Who's this?
3835762	3836062	Hello?
3836082	3838624	Hello?
3839805	3840405	It's nobody.
3841806	3842346	Uh-oh.
3842727	3844328	Someone having microphone troubles.
3845428	3846649	Okay, your five years are up.
3847530	3848611	Where's the Chromehounds?
3850552	3851873	Oh, haha, Chromehound, haha.
3852313	3855055	Yeah, whatever happened to that big Chromehounds match we were supposed to have?
3855095	3855595	Who is this?
3856076	3858457	Well, we found out that the game sucked, and then I stopped playing.
3858497	3860478	Identify yourself, caller, for those that may not know.
3861619	3862380	This is, I'm Bobby.
3862400	3862900	Hi, Bobby.
3863581	3864101	Hi, Bobby.
3864460	3866541	and I'm not going to say where I'm from because it's about you.
3867402	3868723	I appreciate that, Bobby.
3868743	3871264	You can say where you're from, we don't care.
3871324	3871825	Back east.
3873966	3876307	So, yeah, whatever happened to the Chromehounds match?
3876327	3877928	You just, you know, Chromehounds sucks or what?
3878388	3879629	It was just a horrible game.
3879769	3880870	I had already sold it back.
3880890	3883351	I don't know, we couldn't get enough people.
3883371	3884132	He was running from me.
3885313	3885693	Running?
3885873	3887274	Those things can't even run.
3887354	3888975	They just slowly move away.
3888995	3890656	You were slowly waddling away from me.
3891932	3894793	Bobby, as I understand it, you're Loki's only friend on PlayStation 3.
3894873	3897914	No, he was my only friend, and now I have like seven.
3898655	3899555	Oh, well, I see.
3899595	3901276	You haven't added me, have you?
3901296	3903016	You're cheating on Bobby.
3903256	3905157	No, because I don't play my PlayStation 3.
3905237	3907718	Have you guys ever actually played a game together on PlayStation 3?
3908138	3908298	No.
3908919	3909439	That's sad.
3909859	3911520	Have you guys ever played a game together on Xbox?
3912020	3912900	No, I don't think so.
3913440	3915601	No, we played Texas Hold'em one time, I think.
3915961	3917662	Yeah, I remember that.
3919091	3923555	Well, gosh, Bobby, I know you've been podcasting a long time, too, and doing your thing.
3923955	3925137	What do you think?
3925257	3927799	Five years is a long time.
3927839	3929661	A lot of stuff's happened in the game industry.
3930102	3937949	What do you think has been a real big, important news story in the world of gaming that we should take a moment to reflect on at this, our five-year mark?
3939171	3940372	It's changed the gaming world.
3941908	3963802	I believe that the final rise of rhythm games in the U.S., something that I've been really wanting for a long time because I was a big fan of Bimani games back in college and all that stuff, and finally being able to buy them legitimately for my local game system is really something that I really think is a big deal to me at least.
3964947	3972713	So, like, how tons of us had to import that shit for years, and now we can just, you know, kind of get a lot of that stuff stateside.
3973853	3985402	Yeah, and I mean, you know, I mean, that was actually one of the things I wanted to call in to see if you guys had seen about Rock Band via a, you know, Kotaku posts a scan of a magazine that shows the drum peripheral for Rock Band.
3985662	3986803	Yeah, I have that magazine.
3987443	3989485	It's the drum peripheral, though, it's a concept drum.
3989785	3991026	It's the artist's rendition.
3991146	3991326	Yeah.
3992267	3992767	Which is, like,
3993686	3995267	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4015641	4019984	It's basically beat the pad instead of necessarily actual drums.
4020144	4021925	Because you actually play drums, correct?
4021985	4022185	Yes.
4022446	4024347	So this is a subject near and dear to your heart.
4025068	4025228	Right.
4025288	4031212	I want a good drum peripheral for the home game, which I didn't think that Drum Mania for the consoles had.
4032593	4034294	I like the arcade version of Drum Mania.
4034334	4040019	That was actually a Yamaha drum set that I actually considered buying myself, getting the Yamaha DT Express 3.
4041119	4042420	It will work with it, too.
4042440	4044462	It gives you instructions in the manual how to set it up.
4045339	4056663	Yeah, but I bought a Roland one anyway, but I think Rock Band, they were saying that they would actually work with all electronic drum sets that use MIDI and stuff, so I won't have to worry about using this controller, but I feel bad for anybody else who does.
4058524	4059164	I still don't know.
4059184	4060805	The jury's still out on Rock Band for me.
4060825	4062025	I want to see a little more about it.
4062065	4067947	The concept sounds cool, but I'm kind of a little bit leery of spending all this money on it.
4068027	4071409	To be honest, it looks a little too similar to Guitar Hero 3.
4072169	4072389	I mean,
4073151	4074272	Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 2 Guitar Hero 3
4091801	4095003	I think Rock Band is actually building on the Guitar Hero code base a little bit.
4095964	4096524	Very interesting.
4096764	4102889	I want to ask you real quick, because I know you're a fan of Beat Mania, as you've claimed is one of your favorite games of all time.
4103929	4106691	You kind of had me thinking about the whole Japanese-US thing.
4106991	4111875	You really can't get a game like Beat Mania here in the US like you can in Japan, though, right?
4112175	4114636	So to some need, there's still a big need to import.
4115857	4120000	Yeah, well, I mean, all the good songs are on 2DX that you have to import.
4121317	4127019	I'm still importing those because I'm sorry the Britney Spears one on the US Beatmania doesn't cover it.
4127439	4131140	But I do like the US controller for Beatmania more than the Japanese home controller.
4131280	4132160	They did fix that.
4132300	4132840	They sure did.
4133701	4135381	Real quick comment in chat that I think is interesting.
4135401	4136541	I apologize, chat room.
4136581	4137502	We haven't been ignoring you.
4137522	4139062	We've just been focusing so much on the callers.
4139802	4146404	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Super hardcore Bomani fans refuse to give Rock Band a chance and are already judging it.
4147210	4149791	What do you think about those people that are judging the game?
4149831	4152951	Do they do that just because, I don't know, they're ignorant?
4153111	4155392	Or do they do that because Guitar Hero was disappointing to them?
4155412	4168254	I'm sad because I think that if Konami really took a risk and released Guitar Freak's Drum Mania over here and then later on with Karaoke Revolution we could already have something like this and they could be dominating the market.
4168914	4172855	But instead they have focus on other places.
4173646	4201894	Konami's problem was that they insisted on keeping all the J-rock and the J-pop and all that stuff which is great for that segment and great for their current fans but to get the rest of the audience they needed to put in songs that people here recognized and they never did that even when hip-hop mania was tested in arcades it was still all the J-pop and all that stuff so that's where Harmonix picked it up and said hey let's do this and they put in songs people recognized and it became a big hit
4203521	4203962	That's true.
4204002	4219231	That's kind of one thing we've kind of said a lot on this show that Guitar Hero has a lot to thank for its success is the fact that they made the song list a lot smarter and they were able to take a little more risks on it whereas Konami was always playing it safe and felt that the game would sell itself which is the engine.
4220232	4223794	Well they didn't know how they would market a guitar game over here.
4224195	4228357	That was their exact, well my sales rep's opinion on it.
4228397	4232460	They didn't know how they would be able to market it over here which is like dumb but
4233747	4235449	People look at it and then play it.
4236810	4242695	A lot of Guitar Hero marketing is because Best Buy has it set up and people just walk up and try to play it.
4242895	4245757	That's most of their marketing and a lot of people have bought it because of that.
4246358	4250101	Very similar to the Wii, I would say.
4250121	4252523	You kind of see somebody playing it and then you're like, wow, I want to try that.
4252963	4255345	That's kind of different.
4255385	4258828	Bobby, we've got to get some more calls and move on, but anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4260385	4262226	No, it's just congrats on the five years.
4262326	4264547	I know how hard the first hundred was for me.
4264707	4276973	And I do want to just share this, and I promise it will only be about a minute long, is that I was scared to email the mailbag about two years ago when it was still the to-go edition and stuff.
4276993	4281755	And I remember it took me a couple weeks to get the courage to even email Jamie asking about...
4282782	4289045	High Definition Television Lag Fearing Her Wrath Beatmania I think I was nice, wasn't I?
4289245	4290826	She's nice to most of our emailers.
4291826	4305492	You were, but it was just kind of like, oh, these are the guys I've been listening to for so long because I had heard of you guys and I had listened before the podcast came around and stuff and it was kind of like the whole celebrity, oh, I don't know if I want to bother them and stuff like that.
4306952	4310554	But you guys did inspire me to do what I do and I know you've inspired a lot of other people.
4311311	4311951	and thank you for that.
4312231	4314292	That is truly the ultimate compliment.
4314672	4316572	Compliments don't get much bigger than that, honestly.
4316592	4317032	Thank you.
4318332	4319073	It's amazing.
4320293	4321213	Thank you so much, Bobby.
4321733	4329915	We look forward to at least another 100 episodes from you and working with you to help make those a success as well as all the things we partner up to do.
4331275	4332735	Thanks so much and thanks for doing this.
4332795	4333635	Now talk about games.
4333915	4334456	Alright, we'll try.
4334716	4335216	Thanks, Bobby.
4335796	4336016	Bye.
4337659	4342802	Alright, one more call, then we'll get to Jamie's bit, and then we'll take more calls, because we've still got some energy left in us.
4342842	4344383	We're going to do a long show tonight, that's alright.
4346384	4347045	Hi!
4347805	4349206	We finally got to your call.
4349947	4351828	Yo, what's up everyone?
4351888	4352648	Hey!
4352748	4353269	Hi!
4354269	4355550	What's good, people?
4356291	4359092	Amy, you know our call, you know it's official.
4359613	4360893	The party cannot begin, I'm here.
4361374	4361934	Yay!
4361974	4363335	Toga, toga.
4364400	4366002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4382731	4386594	You know, episode 69 is definitely the best episode ever.
4386895	4392259	I definitely vote on that, and you guys gotta put it up on RSS people, keep the download.
4392399	4394001	They gotta hear I'm staying in.
4394141	4394741	They got to.
4395742	4396583	We'll see what we can do.
4396623	4398885	I don't know about they have to hear that, but...
4399400	4401081	You have no say in this, man.
4401101	4401581	The fans demand it.
4401601	4401981	There you go.
4402121	4402501	There you go.
4402521	4403742	That's what I'm talking about.
4403782	4403882	Now...
4427841	4450660	You know, I started my own podcast, and I have to say, you guys were the reason why I started doing this again, you know, because before all of this, I used to run my little two-hour music special on my friggin' cable connection, you know, like maybe every two weeks or whatever, and I just stopped doing it, and after I started listening to you guys again, I'm like, you know, I gotta get into it, you know?
4450900	4453882	I started listening to other podcasts about anime.
4453942	4454843	I couldn't get into it.
4455256	4456017	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4477366	4478306	I don't want to get that personal.
4478326	4480087	I'm only your friend, Ranma, that's all.
4480147	4482068	I don't know, you guys got anything for Ranma?
4482148	4484208	Jamie, you've been here to talk to Ranma all night?
4506331	4506751	Hi.
4507432	4508052	Hey.
4508552	4509833	Dude, I want to come to New York.
4510673	4512734	Dude, I want to come back out to Cali one more time.
4513315	4513795	I'll try.
4513855	4515816	Maybe by the end of the year, I'll bring a crew with me.
4515896	4516256	Maybe.
4516677	4517237	Cool.
4517497	4518278	We'll have a barbecue.
4518438	4518858	Here we go.
4518898	4519638	I got a question.
4520379	4523200	Okay, you guys, your little banter there inspired a question here.
4523280	4531865	Ranma, what are the differences you think, because you've been to both coasts now, what do you think are the differences between the East Coast scene and the West Coast scene?
4532515	4539079	The gaming and anime scene, because, you know, I know we have a lot of listeners of the show who are deeply, you know, who have anime as a passion as well.
4539099	4541621	And if you don't, just, you know, tune out for a couple seconds.
4542321	4545323	Ranma, what would you say is the difference between the gaming and anime scene in the East Coast and West Coast?
4546023	4556750	Well, I can't say too, too much, but it used to be the West Coast was all about the con, the cosplay, the time you put into making that costume.
4557130	4558111	The East Coast was like,
4558536	4564200	We don't give a flying fuck if you did put 100 hours into that freaking Sephiroth costume.
4564560	4566841	How much alcohol can you take Saturday night?
4567222	4568442	That's what it was always about.
4568803	4570083	West Coast was the cosplay.
4570324	4571544	East Coast was about the party.
4571764	4572385	I don't know.
4572505	4574646	Faname has always kind of been about who can hold their liquor.
4575487	4576247	It's blending now.
4576287	4582952	I mean, I see on the West Coast, people over there, the West Coast is more fun, more friendly, you know?
4582992	4583832	That's what I saw.
4583872	4585933	When I was at Faname, I really had a great time.
4586334	4586674	I mean...
4587327	4588708	A lot of props to people.
4588748	4594091	I don't see a lot of that over on the East Coast, because half the time, it's all about the fucking drama shit.
4594191	4597233	I mean, on the West Coast, I know there's drama, but they keep it on the down low.
4597373	4602556	Whereas on the East Coast, all it takes is somebody to walk past, let the drama roll begin, you know?
4602996	4603857	And it's just too much.
4604397	4605438	It depends on the clicks.
4606218	4614803	That too, and it's like, and whereas me, I'm with multiple clicks, and it's like, I gotta be careful who I chill with, and I bet if I had those same clicks on the West Coast...
4615407	4616708	The drama shit wouldn't even bother.
4616748	4618030	It was like, fine, whatever.
4618130	4618811	We're all hanging out.
4618891	4619832	We're all going to have a good time.
4622895	4623335	Well, go ahead.
4623996	4630683	As for the gaming, I would say, you know, one thing about the West Coast, the gamers know how to use deodorant.
4630883	4631964	That's what I can say.
4632264	4632925	Definitely.
4635047	4637490	I didn't really catch too much fanboy funk this year, though.
4638070	4638591	Exactly.
4638651	4638831	I mean,
4639212	4645534	You go to like Otacon, which is like the big connect, you walk in, you're going to get smacked in the face with a wave of funk.
4645814	4646474	Seriously.
4648015	4649695	And not the good George Clinton kind, right?
4650175	4650895	Exactly.
4651296	4651616	Mm-hmm.
4653656	4656697	I think it's kind of funky in here because we've been, you know, smelling Rob.
4656937	4657417	Oh, shut up.
4657717	4658938	I took a shower today just for you.
4659558	4660698	Maybe some of your sneakers are on.
4661459	4665400	Sorry, I just had to run out and check on the air situation because we're burning up in here, so anyway.
4665880	4665980	Okay.
4666773	4670356	Ranma, thanks so much for the call and for being a friend.
4670436	4671877	Thank you for being a friend.
4672837	4676480	Now, before I go, I have to do the same toast I did last year.
4676600	4679902	Even though somebody stole it, I'm going to do it.
4680142	4680643	Go for it.
4680783	4683725	In my hand is a can of Guinness.
4684025	4686146	I'm going to crack it open right now.
4686387	4688988	I have the last sip of champagne left in my glass.
4689489	4690770	I have champagne in my belly.
4691610	4693031	Then I'll toast DarkSakura's belly.
4693551	4693752	No.
4693812	4693872	No.
4695273	4697074	I have Guinness at home, so I'll just do it when I get home.
4697094	4697875	Okay, take it away, Ranma.
4698335	4698655	Here we go.
4698996	4702438	Here's to you, here's to me, the best a friend will ever be.
4702758	4706701	If we ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.
4706861	4708042	I'm drinking this bitch down.
4709283	4709964	Very well said.
4711625	4715308	I actually just tried to use the champagne glass as a microphone.
4715548	4717669	Oh, no.
4719591	4719831	All right.
4720746	4722028	I'll talk to you guys.
4722168	4724991	I'll see you guys sometime again.
4725272	4725772	It's going to happen.
4725792	4726153	Peace.
4739512	4740673	Do you not want to do mailbag tonight?
4740693	4742154	I could do mailbag, but no.
4742214	4743094	Let's do a couple emails.
4743154	4743414	Okay.
4743574	4746115	All right, because some folks, not everybody can get in on the phone.
4746696	4750818	And I really apologize to those of you calling on the phone like crazy.
4751298	4755300	Some folks have been calling in seriously since we started taking calls and still haven't gotten through.
4755660	4757741	We're going to take more calls very soon, I promise.
4758701	4765464	We want to get to the email bags and then more calls, and we'll hopefully get everybody that's trying to call in, even if we have to go to the two-minute lightning round.
4765564	4766245	All right, here we go.
4766625	4767085	Mailbag time.
4772883	4774785	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
4774805	4777407	We always welcome your emails and DarkSakura is going to read them right now.
4778288	4778608	I am?
4779629	4779849	Okay.
4780089	4780569	It's you better.
4781730	4785353	First email is, Dear OLR, I have one simple question.
4785393	4787435	What the hell happened to White Knight for the PS3?
4787895	4791338	Keep up the great work, your Serbian listener, Alyosha.
4792879	4795181	PS Level 5 needs to make another Dark Cloud game.
4795851	4796851	I'm the foggiest idea.
4796871	4797892	I haven't been following that game.
4797932	4799012	Loki, you know anything about this?
4799032	4800613	This is more up your alley with the whole title.
4800633	4801713	It's just not come out yet.
4802213	4802994	Is it delayed?
4803054	4803414	Canceled?
4803434	4804514	It's just kind of sleeping?
4804894	4805575	Probably sleeping.
4806175	4806515	You know what?
4806535	4807575	You know where White Knight is?
4807715	4808716	It's with Africa.
4809536	4810356	That's where White Knight went.
4810376	4811537	The White Knight went to Africa.
4812597	4813077	That's where it is.
4814298	4814818	Okay.
4814858	4815598	We don't know, buddy.
4815618	4816639	Sorry, they haven't said anything.
4816679	4817379	That's the best we got.
4817479	4818979	Unless chatroom knows something, we don't.
4820440	4821820	What does the chatroom know that we don't?
4822261	4823281	They're just saying Africa.
4824520	4827142	Rob, I'll stop making hate mail.
4827162	4831706	I've decided to make more emails begging Loki to play more Drunken Mario Kart GP.
4850703	4860629	The annoying 12-year-old who wants a more drunken Mario Kart needs another arcade because the last one left doesn't have DDR but has initial D. But we're suing the place, and so it isn't smart to go there.
4860669	4862831	Still youngest listener, DDR Maniac, and that's all.
4863611	4864812	Wow, that's a hell of a signature.
4865652	4867313	Thank you for backing off for once.
4867774	4869555	And, you know, YouTube.
4870075	4871456	We need more stuff on YouTube.
4872477	4876179	My camera does a lot of better digital stuff now, so we need to do some craziness on YouTube.
4876739	4878821	Loki, drink, and then we'll film you.
4878881	4879201	It's funny.
4882029	4885153	I'm sifting through the emails because I want to get some of them read.
4887295	4888617	One of them is MasterKiller.
4889654	4892756	Hi, I hear that Rob bought Puzzle Quest on DS.
4893156	4894797	I recently purchased the game on PSP.
4895397	4897858	The game is great, but the game freezes every second.
4897898	4898979	I'm not sure what it is.
4899359	4902181	I looked in all the forums, and I'm not the only one.
4902381	4908004	Does the glitches and freezes occur only on the DS version you have?
4908444	4910665	Did you hear anything about a recaller patch coming soon?
4910765	4911586	PS, love the show.
4911726	4912206	Smile face.
4912762	4913723	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4936204	4937165	That sounds like a good idea.
4937185	4937846	Next email, shall I?
4950715	4954339	Hey OLR crew, first and foremost, congratulations on your 5th anniversary.
4954740	4958724	OB continued to output the same level of awesomeness or higher in the future.
4959225	4967575	I started listening to OLR last year after looking for Orange Lounge songs to put on my MySpace profile, only to stumble on the OLR MySpace page.
4968215	4978498	My first episode, funnily enough, was the fourth anniversary episode, which kept me busy during freshman orientation at my college campus when I have nothing to do and on a road trip to Reno.
4978998	4982779	On another note, something about the OLR after-birth cage match has been bugging me lately.
4983200	4989141	Songs that win supposedly get put in rotation on the stream, which I've listened to while playing Albatross 18.
4990722	4994783	Yet the only cage match winner I've heard on the stream is Loki's Zodiac Don't Play Nice Mashup.
4995370	4998531	Are these songs actually being put in play, or am I just listening at the wrong times?
4998671	5000732	Love, GS68.
5001452	5008054	They are, but the problem is we have a 16-hour playlist on the regular station, and it only is going to come up once in that time.
5008915	5019178	It sounds like you've heard it once, but the problem is it's one song in a huge rotation of music, so unfortunately it doesn't always come up.
5019599	5023540	And sometimes it does go into rotation late in the week because I'm lazy.
5025365	5026585	Last email.
5027106	5036428	Honestly, though, I have to admit, Cage Match Song going into rotation is the last priority behind getting the podcast out on time and all that, making sure all games gets the syndicated run and all that stuff.
5037249	5037749	Last email.
5038789	5044291	Dear Orange Challenge Radio, collectively known as Rob, Matt, and Jamie, congratulations on five years of being a festering rash on the internet.
5044591	5045631	JK, heart, heart, heart, heart.
5046600	5048281	Seriously, though, you guys are freaking awesome.
5048341	5053425	I first learned about LLR through DDR Freak Forums because someone had a link in their signature and decided to check it out.
5053765	5058128	Unfortunately, I was an internet noob and had no idea what was going on, so I just thought it was a music station.
5058449	5059590	That was three or four years ago.
5059710	5060130	Smalthies.
5060942	5066248	Fall of 05 was when I rediscovered OLR and learned about your now-deceased, frowny-faced OLR to-go edition.
5066468	5068710	Isn't this for what we're doing, like, for the whole show now?
5068750	5079502	Well, kinda, but you know, some people liked it better in its compact format, but you know, we have to make decisions based on what we think is best, and you can't please everybody, so sorry you didn't agree.
5081033	5083914	It was an hour slash hour and a half of news.
5084034	5087015	Rob being funny, Jamie being angry, and Matt hating on Max.
5087075	5087495	Woohoo.
5087595	5088595	That was my freshman year.
5089015	5089776	Now I'm a junior.
5090116	5091076	Well, going to be one.
5091436	5093477	P. The tongue face.
5093997	5097158	And I've listened to every episode of OLR since you guys started the new format.
5097418	5100959	You three are my main source of gaming information with Kotaku filling in the blanks.
5101339	5102839	And also a big source of entertainment.
5103079	5106941	I have to say that it's mildly awkward when one of you are Rice Princess or Exifer or Casper the Gay.
5107721	5108321	With an O face.
5108883	5115044	or anyone else says some hilarious and I burst into laughter in the train and other public place which leads to weird stares and crap mutterings.
5115084	5116144	That kid is crazy.
5116965	5117905	Of course, that's half the fun.
5118325	5128787	I want to get mushy but that's too weird so I'll just leave it at that and congratulate you guys on five years of being some of the coolest people on the internet and wish you luck in the next five years.
5129187	5131528	I'll make a shirt that says I grew up with Orange Lounge.
5132208	5134948	Sincerely yours with hearts and love.
5135228	5136669	Heart, heart, heart, heart.
5136769	5137149	Sycoon.
5137689	5137989	P.S.
5138009	5138609	That was a cute email.
5139324	5142606	I bought Pac-Man CE and I'm not sure why, cry cry.
5143326	5146147	PPS, shoot the whoop, charging my lasers.
5146808	5147268	What?
5147488	5148728	I don't know, but it's funny.
5148748	5152450	They just wanted you to say that on air so they could cut that out and have that as a sound effect.
5152470	5152790	That's great.
5152870	5153491	Shoot the whoop.
5154511	5156612	I just go around saying, charging my lasers.
5156872	5157413	Shoot the whoop.
5157433	5158293	That was awesome.
5158513	5160654	You need to send emails like that again so I can say more cool stuff.
5160694	5163916	You play Pac-Man CE for the Rayvar music, that's why.
5165476	5166197	That's why you play it.
5166337	5166737	Yeah.
5167096	5168917	Hey peoples of OLR, congratulations to 5 years of OLR.
5168937	5173120	I must admit that I feel kinda old being around for most of those 5 years.
5173140	5176022	Going back to the drunk episodes and the randomness that is the 3 hour show.
5194545	5198947	I have so much praise for you guys, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, and everyone else who has made this show what it is today.
5199427	5207851	So yeah, the reason I'm writing, just recently or probably already implemented the game review site that nobody gives two shits about, NoNotOneUp, GameSpot is going to change its rating systems this week.
5208291	5211632	They state that they are going to a .5 base system, no more 8.8 like scores.
5213013	5213833	And I lost my place.
5214466	5217907	and going to remove the sub-score system for graphics, gameplay, sound, etc.
5217967	5227830	They are going to add medal-slash-reward-slash-achievement-slash-e-penis points for things like excellent graphics and sound to blatant overwhoring of advertisements and overall suck.
5228550	5231010	As for many listeners, including myself, we could give a shit!
5232051	5236672	But it got me thinking, why are people so fixated with a 7 out of 10 score for an average game?
5237293	5239094	Why, whatever happened to a 5 being averaged?
5239154	5240054	Is it too low for people?
5240295	5241755	Is it too close to a 3 or a 1?
5242055	5246097	Do fanboys have a splintered... By the way, fanboys, to make it plural, you do not add an apostrophe.
5246598	5248659	Have a splintered baseball bat stuck up their ass?
5248859	5249579	Who the fuck knows?
5249619	5253541	I would like to ask if any of the current rating systems work, or do they need to all be revamped?
5253581	5255002	And Hal, thanks for your time.
5255502	5256323	GS191.
5256823	5257903	Wow, heavy question.
5258264	5261565	It's because now people... I read that like the biggest run-on sentence ever.
5261745	5262146	Seriously?
5262186	5267048	If you were to look at, like, mathematically, yes, 5 would be, you know, averaged.
5267483	5274905	Although people are looking at it like grade scores, which, you know, 50% would be failure and 70% would be average.
5275025	5281927	So, unfortunately, everybody's sucking that school mentality, and that's why the rating system's all fucked up.
5282727	5287468	Because it's actually a five-point system instead of ten, because those bottom five are failures.
5290569	5291089	You know, I don't...
5291940	5292340	And I might rent it.
5311360	5312400	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5338712	5343496	And you can pretty much guarantee that they're always going to be negative because they're holding off on playing them until later on.
5344236	5352143	And, you know, it could be stuff that's not half bad, but they have a vendetta against certain things like, you know, for example, Fantastic Four or something.
5352183	5357847	They'll say, well, I don't like Fantastic Four, so it gets a lower review or something like that.
5358936	5360817	But this isn't what I remember from the comics.
5361397	5364639	Review it as a game, not as what you remember from the comics.
5365079	5370641	Some folks in chat room are talking about X-Play, and JV Mon says, I hate X-Play's Para Para Paradise review.
5371041	5374423	And, you know, it just goes to show you some people don't get it.
5375303	5379265	You know, but there's a lot of games out there to play, and sometimes people don't get the things that other folks are into.
5379285	5379685	Here's the thing.
5379745	5382447	They weren't actually reviewing Para Para Paradise.
5382787	5384167	They were doing a funny bit.
5384347	5385288	That's all they were doing.
5385308	5386668	I mean, really, it hasn't come up.
5386688	5387969	That's questionable if it was funny or not.
5388496	5389676	Well, they were doing a bit, okay?
5389696	5390657	It hasn't come over here.
5391397	5393458	It's not a game that was released in the United States.
5393978	5395258	So why were they reviewing it?
5395619	5396639	Oh, to be funny.
5396759	5397839	That's why they were doing it.
5398960	5402321	Because who doesn't like to laugh at someone playing Power of Paradise?
5402341	5406022	Because it's such a girly game, and people, you know, like making fun of that.
5407043	5407323	All right.
5407943	5410044	Well, anything else, I guess?
5410124	5410764	No, that was the last email?
5410784	5411264	No, that's it.
5411504	5413045	Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
5413305	5416486	We're running, wow, we're about an hour and a half into this, but we're going to take some more calls.
5417364	5418185	And keep on going.
5418605	5419225	So here we go.
5419325	5421427	Back to the phones.
5421447	5424869	1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.
5425750	5426831	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5426851	5427211	Who's this?
5428232	5428652	Hey, guys.
5428672	5429112	Can you hear me?
5429533	5430013	Yes, we can.
5430033	5430373	Who is this?
5431014	5432235	Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
5432355	5433355	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
5433456	5434036	What's on your mind?
5434917	5435557	Oh, not much.
5436197	5441741	I just really wanted to call and say happy to hear you guys got 500 episodes.
5441761	5442342	Congratulations.
5442762	5445144	It's actually five years, not 500, but that's all right.
5446535	5449117	I'm still blitzed from today.
5449377	5451258	Are we doing a little drinking today?
5452458	5454940	No, I was in the middle of the whole Pride thing.
5455040	5455760	It was nuts.
5456660	5461643	You know, it's strange that you're not the first person to make that 500 mistake, which is kind of strange.
5463544	5466225	Okay, I don't feel so bad now.
5466345	5466866	No, it's cool.
5466906	5467346	It's all good.
5468406	5469467	Let's talk about games.
5470648	5471888	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
5473609	5474690	Mostly DS stuff.
5476439	5477680	Are you a big fan of handhelds?
5478800	5485764	Yeah, they're easy for me to get into and easy for me to take on the go since I'm constantly in one place to another place to another place.
5486764	5489386	Here's something big that's happened in the past five years.
5489466	5496209	Remember when the DS was first announced and a lot of people were like, that's kind of weird that you're going to be using the touchscreen.
5496569	5501051	And now the system is monstrously successful, the Nintendo DS.
5501531	5504433	Why do you think Nintendo has had such success with the DS?
5506073	5510217	Because they were forced to actually make games instead of just rehashing some stuff, one.
5510978	5525756	And two, they actually took advantage of the originality of just using touchscreen, rather than just saying, okay, here's a portable system, let's just bring some games from the other systems and just water it down for the portables.
5526849	5527971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5541162	5542863	You know what, I actually really agree with that comment.
5542883	5547145	I think that's why the DS has been successful, is that really the only thing you can do on it is games.
5547465	5552648	I mean, granted, now they have the Opera browser and all that stuff, but let's face it, all that crap was an afterthought.
5553068	5554949	It was, you know, really a game system first.
5555009	5562032	And not to knock the PSP, because I know a lot of folks listen to this show on the PSP, and that's actually why the PSP is pretty awesome.
5562453	5563153	Because it's like...
5564093	5567594	It's the red mage of portable gaming is what the PSP is.
5567994	5571255	It's a little bit of everything, but it's not really strong at anything.
5571575	5572955	It's a little bit iPod.
5573355	5574956	It's a little bit web browser.
5575356	5576576	It's a little bit gaming.
5576996	5578297	It's a little bit this and that.
5579037	5582438	But it doesn't really 100% excel at any of it.
5582518	5583978	But that doesn't necessarily make it bad.
5584318	5584978	It's a red mage.
5585498	5587679	That's quite possibly the best comparison I could make.
5588697	5591760	Well, then you also get the PSP has a lot shorter battery life.
5591820	5593441	So it does a little bit of a battery life.
5593901	5594342	That's true.
5594562	5595383	But don't get me wrong.
5595403	5596263	I love my PSP.
5596323	5597284	Try playing a Nomad.
5598245	5603469	And movies look so sharp on the PSP and so do websites.
5603489	5605531	That's why I love that little screen on the PSP.
5605631	5607353	I wish the DS had something that sharp.
5609314	5609895	I agree with.
5610515	5611016	I agree with.
5611616	5614779	And I did play one other game that wasn't a handheld.
5615760	5616120	What's that?
5617000	5618661	Virtua Fighter 5 on the PS3.
5619741	5620581	Ah, now how was that?
5622442	5626784	I think I'm the only fan of the Virtua Fighter series because I was in love with it.
5628744	5630145	So you totally love the game?
5631385	5632546	Oh, I love the series.
5633426	5633486	Ah.
5634102	5637803	Well, you know, I don't know, DarkSakura, weren't you a bit of a Virtua Fighter fan, at least in the beginning?
5637983	5638304	Never.
5638824	5639004	Really?
5639024	5639904	I hate Virtua Fighter.
5639924	5641325	I thought you did like it.
5641885	5643005	No, Dan loves Virtua Fighter.
5643426	5644846	I personally thought the game was shit.
5645146	5647167	I just made you assume that because you're a Sega fangirl.
5647187	5652309	The only time I played any Virtua Fighter for any amount of time was playing Virtua Fighter 2 to try to knock off Kage's mask.
5654970	5656550	And people know what I'm talking about.
5657211	5657551	Yes.
5659672	5662913	I don't know, I enjoyed the fifth one, and I actually also got to play on...
5663795	5665216	on a high-definition projector.
5665716	5666056	Ooh.
5667216	5669257	Oh, yeah.
5669317	5673659	I couldn't even play for like five minutes just watching it.
5675020	5679421	TheRobD says, I was more obsessed with knocking off Blue Mary's shirt in Real Bout 2.
5681062	5682423	It's always the nudity with you people.
5682923	5684343	I guess I'll say this.
5684543	5685684	Have you played Xbox 360?
5686384	5686564	Never?
5687144	5688165	A few times, actually, yes.
5688325	5689926	So what do you think graphics-wise?
5689946	5692807	Do you think a game like Virtua Fighter will look as good on the 360?
5694945	5696166	I think it probably would work.
5696406	5697767	I think it probably would look good.
5698347	5706772	My only concern about the series is that as long as it moves just the same, just as smooth, because that's a game where it's a true Twitch fest.
5706992	5708373	One frame and you're dead.
5709272	5709952	Hmm, good point.
5710213	5725962	And the reason why I ask that, not that I'm, like, you know, dumb or anything, I just, you know, because sometimes people say, well, the PS3 has the true HD built in and all this, so I'm just kind of, you know, curious, like, you know, they kind of insinuate that it has a graphical edge on Xbox 360, so I'm just kind of curious if anyone ever notices it.
5726703	5726883	Ever.
5727763	5735048	I think it would, but I think, honestly, the best way for me, to me, would actually get both of them side by side in a way and see how they look.
5735808	5736009	Right.
5736529	5736669	Well...
5737219	5739820	Um, DDR Dollar Bill, we gotta let you go to take some more calls.
5739880	5740961	Any last minute thoughts?
5741581	5742842	Yes, I don't have a podcast.
5743782	5744162	There you go.
5744522	5745823	Alright, well then nothing to plug.
5745903	5747064	So, well, that's cool.
5747144	5748104	Maybe you'll start one someday.
5749145	5749785	Eh, I doubt it.
5749845	5750485	I'm too busy.
5750825	5751746	Alright, well, fair enough.
5751766	5753286	Well, thank you for choosing ours to listen to.
5753306	5753907	We appreciate it.
5754407	5754907	Thanks, guys.
5755027	5755407	Later.
5757248	5758469	Alright, Jamie, you get this call.
5759409	5761150	This one is your turn.
5761170	5762131	Hold on, I haven't picked it up yet.
5762531	5762931	Oh, okay.
5766361	5767302	Sorry, Skype's being annoying.
5768062	5768942	Hi.
5770003	5770403	Hi.
5770943	5771503	Who's this?
5772543	5773144	It's Roz.
5773724	5774364	Hi!
5775565	5776165	It's Roz!
5776845	5778446	Oh my god, hi!
5779586	5779966	Hi.
5781247	5782127	What's on your mind, Roz?
5783708	5786509	Um, I mostly wanted to talk to Jamie.
5787149	5788810	OMG, a girl called in.
5789070	5791131	OMG, a girl, a real life girl.
5793832	5794772	What do you want to say to Jamie?
5796367	5798989	I want to say I'm so sorry for disappearing.
5799910	5800410	That's okay.
5800450	5801411	I forgive you, I think.
5802471	5803252	I do it all the time.
5803272	5805393	You have to make up for it with bleached zombie butts.
5807375	5807835	I'm sorry.
5807895	5810457	What are you turning our fifth anniversary show into, you two?
5810637	5811498	It's an in-joke.
5811638	5812478	I see that.
5812919	5816081	It's on the other site that I hang out on, Gorillas Unofficial.
5816541	5816861	Ah, I get you.
5818776	5822398	You remember when we were all in studio playing with that word rearranger thing?
5822798	5823499	In the chat here.
5823859	5829102	And she made one that said, Orange Lounge Radio owns everything including bleached zombie butts.
5829142	5829502	I remember that.
5829542	5832064	It was one of those fridge magnet site things where you can make your own stuff.
5832084	5834806	That's part of my signature on Gorillas Unofficial.
5834926	5835486	Good times.
5836267	5836687	Yeah.
5837588	5838828	I totally stole it from Roz.
5839609	5841570	Yeah, except I disappeared from there, too.
5842091	5843571	I noticed that, too, Missy.
5844572	5845653	So you're going to hang out more, right?
5846923	5848444	Well, you've been busy with school, though, right?
5850585	5851065	Not really.
5851085	5853706	Actually, I've been busy with medical problems.
5854206	5855067	Oh, sorry to hear that.
5856467	5857888	Oh, it's not any different from usual.
5857928	5859069	I'm pretty much used to it.
5860409	5861950	Well, you shouldn't have to be used to that.
5862730	5864011	It happens.
5864371	5865752	Yeah.
5865872	5866652	I can sympathize.
5866712	5867953	I had my problems last year.
5869293	5869834	Oh, yeah.
5870834	5872155	I have drugs for that now.
5872175	5872275	Yeah.
5873709	5877993	Luckily, the video game addiction thing didn't go through or I might have a medical problem as well.
5878213	5879214	I've got a medical problem.
5879234	5883358	It's called Rob-itis, which would technically mean inflammation of the Rob.
5883378	5883418	Ew.
5885580	5886741	Rob, are you inflamed?
5888542	5890164	Girl, are you trying to say I'm flaming?
5890804	5893447	I don't know what you're trying to say, girl, but you're making me mad.
5896970	5897891	Rob's inflamed.
5898797	5899738	Oh my.
5899758	5899958	Oh my.
5899978	5900098	Oh my.
5900118	5900478	Oh my.
5929778	5933040	and happy little anniversary, Chindig.
5933260	5938422	I thought I'd, you know, get back to the planet to join you for this.
5938842	5940143	Ground control to Major Tom.
5941964	5942664	Something like that.
5943084	5945966	Well, we appreciate you and you're a very down-to-earth phone call.
5946026	5946986	We really appreciate that.
5947126	5948267	Thanks for calling, Roz.
5948287	5948927	We missed you.
5949807	5950368	I know you did.
5950388	5951668	But my aim's improving.
5952689	5953329	Bye, Roz.
5953689	5954129	Take care.
5954309	5954890	Bye.
5955130	5955530	Bye-bye.
5956490	5957551	It's nice to hear from a girl.
5958407	5959588	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5988137	5989719	Hello, this is Orange Lines Radio.
5990700	5991000	Who is this?
5991020	5991280	Hello?
5991741	5992021	Hello.
5992802	5993722	Hello, it's Shaveymon.
5993963	5994543	Hey, how's it going?
5995224	5995724	Hi!
5996025	5996305	You?
5997406	5998167	I actually got through.
5998227	5999668	I didn't think this would ever happen.
6000389	6001550	So my question's for Rob.
6001950	6002631	Yes, sir.
6004433	6006595	Would Flaming Finger ever work on the DS?
6008397	6012801	Only if it has a soundtrack with the quality of the original Flaming Finger.
6013476	6020525	For those that have never played Flaming Finger, because I have to give background now, Flaming Finger is one of those ticket-spitter games, and I've only seen them ever in two places.
6021005	6027013	Dave & Buster's, just about every Dave & Buster's I've ever walked into has one of these machines, and randomly Sunnyvale Golf Land had one.
6028439	6038925	and you basically, you use your finger to navigate through this maze and the game totally cheats because as you get like three-fourths of the way through the maze, the clock starts counting down much faster.
6039386	6042207	But it's got this very distinctive rave beat to the game.
6042928	6044189	Flaming finger!
6044209	6046930	And of course, you know, all the homosexual jokes you can make with it.
6046990	6049592	Tee hee gay, tee hee flaming, ha ha ha.
6049692	6050552	Get your flame on.
6050632	6051493	Get your flame on!
6054523	6058945	and, uh, yeah, I kind of froze up and don't know what to say now.
6058965	6059405	That's it?
6059485	6060325	That's all you wanted to say?
6060765	6062305	You wanted to ask if I gave my phone?
6062446	6063946	I've been trying to get through all night and I finally did.
6064446	6068427	Just to ask if I enjoy Flaming Finger or if it should come out on the DS.
6068907	6072788	I also wanted to congratulate you guys for five years.
6073208	6073468	Thank you.
6073488	6075349	I remember listening to the first episode and, uh,
6075745	6077125	I was a complete douchebag back then.
6077145	6081266	You guys actually banned me from the chat room.
6081547	6084247	We banned JVmon from chat during the first episode.
6084627	6085368	That's amazing.
6085388	6086808	He's since proven himself.
6087448	6087628	Yes.
6088108	6089229	Rehab works.
6090109	6091309	Yeah.
6091929	6092529	Crying and moaning.
6092609	6093350	OLR rehab.
6094370	6099431	I don't know about that, but I'd also like to thank Jamie for introducing me to Doctor Who, my new form of crack.
6099711	6100291	Yeah.
6100892	6102172	I'm getting people addicted.
6103169	6106572	He's also one of the people I talk to every day online, too, now.
6107313	6108934	Yes, Jamie's my new online BFF.
6112538	6114780	And thanks for lunch in New York City, Jamie Mon.
6114800	6115681	I appreciate that.
6115941	6117903	And I wasn't the one that banned you from chat, was I?
6119244	6120065	No, I think it was Jamie.
6120225	6120625	Oh, okay.
6120705	6121626	Well, you know she does that.
6121646	6123388	Well, I do that all the time.
6123408	6124869	With her enormous panhammer.
6126889	6129352	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6145638	6147519	for us in gaming in the past five years.
6147559	6150460	Like, you know how, like, you know, especially five years ago, he signed on to Xbox Live.
6150501	6154503	It's fag, fag, fag, fag, you know, gay, gay, that's gay.
6154823	6156544	Do you think there's been any progress?
6156884	6163227	Because, you know, I noticed the visibility of, like, you know, the gaygamer.net and, like, a lot of those, like, gay gaming communities.
6163687	6169670	It seems like there's an awful lot more people out there now that will admit they're gay in the gaming scene than there used to be.
6169710	6171171	I don't know if it's just me, but what do you think?
6172367	6174089	I just think that over time has passed.
6174109	6178934	People have just been more accepting about it because it can't hide it anymore.
6179014	6180395	It's just there and it's out there.
6180736	6182798	It's either you got with the times or you just got left behind.
6183138	6187342	So in other words, if you put it on your MySpace profile somewhere, somebody is going to find it and they know.
6187362	6188624	Pretty much.
6188664	6191287	If you put it on MySpace, it's on the Internet.
6191307	6192748	It's like trying to get pee out of a pool.
6192948	6193128	Do you –
6197577	6207354	Do you think that it might be a mirror of society where maybe there's been a more general acceptance of gay lifestyle and gay culture in society?
6208116	6208276	Yeah.
6208786	6210067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6235194	6237335	and it's because of those shows on TV like Queer Eye.
6237355	6240457	So even though not my kind of show, like, you know, it just kind of gives visibility.
6240577	6241218	So I don't know.
6242038	6243839	I guess we're talking about something a lot bigger than gaming.
6243879	6245000	So I should probably hang up on you now.
6245820	6246721	If only if you want.
6246961	6248382	All right.
6249423	6249683	All right.
6249903	6251404	Well, take care, JV Mon.
6251544	6253845	And and yeah, thanks for calling.
6254346	6256527	And next week for me, like two weeks.
6256707	6257027	Sweet.
6257067	6257708	I love CDs.
6258788	6258968	All right.
6258988	6261550	I'll let you have more important.
6262136	6262356	All right.
6263057	6264538	It's just more calls, JV Ma.
6264958	6266339	No one call is more important than the other.
6267000	6267300	All right.
6267540	6267800	All right.
6267940	6268241	Take care.
6268801	6269081	You too.
6269221	6269362	Bye.
6269382	6269602	Bye-bye.
6270482	6274906	Now we have people in chat that are like, I'm in choir.
6274926	6275366	I'm not gay.
6275446	6276487	I didn't say all.
6277027	6278829	I just said a lot.
6278909	6282712	Not even a lot, but you have to admit that there – I don't know.
6282752	6287495	At least when I was in high school, like at least half the guys in choir were a little bit fruity.
6287615	6289497	And maybe it's – I would think it's still that way today.
6289517	6290778	I'm not saying they all are.
6291567	6292087	Back off.
6292167	6293848	God, now we're going to get emails and everything, too.
6295348	6296628	DarkSakura, weren't you in choir?
6298389	6302750	I was until they made me sing with the boys because I had a low voice.
6303110	6304430	Gay boys or straight boys?
6305850	6306571	This was church.
6307491	6308351	Oh, never mind.
6308391	6308931	That's different.
6308951	6311872	Well, no, I did chorus for two weeks, but I was supposed to be in band.
6311912	6313832	That's a whole other can of worms.
6313852	6314252	Yeah, I know.
6314452	6314733	All right.
6315313	6316373	Let's go to another call.
6317393	6318513	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6318533	6318894	Who's this?
6319514	6320654	Hey, this is FLorex.
6321335	6322036	Hi, BlackDevilerX.
6322056	6322816	You're a little bit quiet.
6322876	6323977	Make sure you're talking right in the mic.
6323997	6324437	What's on your mind?
6324457	6325998	Not much.
6328520	6330441	Gosh, I'm hearing a ringing in the background, but that's okay.
6330821	6332562	I hear that.
6332782	6333183	That's weird.
6333203	6333783	We hear it, too.
6333843	6334283	That's okay.
6334303	6334724	Keep trying.
6334924	6335444	What's on your mind?
6338626	6345991	I don't know if you called in last week, or if you remember I called in a couple weeks ago, and I was trying to get a Wii, and I finally got one.
6347250	6348990	You finally got a weed?
6349270	6352311	It sounds like someone's drinking a Slurpee over there or something, doesn't it?
6352371	6355912	I can't figure that... I'm sorry, I'm playing with something else here, I'll pump it away.
6356192	6360313	Ah, that's why we hear... I swear to God, it's like we hear a Slurpee or in the background or something, or like a bong.
6360553	6361513	Are you smoking weed?
6361913	6363313	No, I am not smoking weed.
6363373	6363894	Alright, okay.
6364054	6365054	Are you smoking crack?
6365274	6366014	Alright.
6366354	6366574	Oh.
6367374	6368134	We're just kidding.
6368194	6369955	You don't smoke crack in a bong.
6369975	6370415	Anyway.
6372815	6373415	Not that I'd know.
6374816	6375976	So you finally got a Wii.
6376376	6376616	I did.
6377117	6377937	Congratulations.
6377997	6378997	How did you manage to do it?
6379578	6387481	I actually had to buy it in a bundle with two other games and another Wii remote.
6388942	6390282	And where did you get this bundle at?
6391263	6393224	I got this bundle at the Virgin Mega Store.
6394084	6395405	Ah, so a forced bundle.
6395685	6397426	What do you think about forced bundles?
6397666	6398526	I don't like them.
6399146	6400267	But you bought one anyway.
6401007	6402289	I just really don't like them.
6402810	6404653	Especially when the game selections suck.
6420821	6426705	You probably can't hear it on your end, but we keep hearing this little... It's like a slurpee or a ring or something every two seconds.
6426806	6427406	It's so funny.
6427967	6430589	Anyway, so are you happy now that you got a Wii?
6430629	6431930	Have you actually been playing it?
6432110	6432390	Yes.
6432971	6439456	I've got... Well, the two games that I had to get were Marvel Ultimate Alliance and Spider-Man 3.
6440457	6440877	Very good.
6441798	6444600	You didn't opt for Zelda or Trauma Center or any of that stuff?
6444620	6445521	They didn't have Zelda.
6445561	6446502	They didn't have Trauma Center.
6446842	6448984	I mean, their game selection just sucked.
6451466	6452406	They had Cooking Mama.
6453146	6456387	Well, Cooking Mama's a little bit better on the DS than it is on the Wii, to be honest.
6459127	6474750	Okay, so the main thing I wanted to do tonight while I was calling in was back when I was listening, I think a couple of years ago before I had kind of the Sunday night commitment and I dropped out and I'm sorry, was to open a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.
6476430	6479291	And here I am opening a pint of
6479818	6482959	of Chocolate Cookie Dough Ice Cream in your honor.
6482999	6483979	This is like my little toast.
6484619	6485040	Here we go.
6485640	6485860	All right.
6487200	6490221	I'm clanking my empty champagne glass to your cookie dough ice cream.
6491121	6491541	There you go.
6492242	6495543	My stomach is digesting in honor of your ice cream.
6495663	6495963	All right.
6497063	6498183	We got to let you go, buddy.
6498203	6499464	That ringing is driving me nuts.
6499684	6503965	But thank you very much for the call and listen to the playback on the podcast because it's hilarious.
6504765	6505726	Banana phone.
6505826	6506066	Bye.
6506326	6506626	Bye.
6511455	6514220	Hey, this is Jonathan Fields, how you doing?
6514240	6514480	Hi, who?
6526420	6527040	John Fields.
6527321	6527881	Oh, hi!
6528361	6530222	You were on the show like a long-ass time ago.
6530302	6534665	He's the guy that flew out here like all the way from like, what, Connecticut you're at?
6534785	6535665	Yeah, Connecticut.
6535685	6536846	I'm in New Jersey now.
6537086	6537186	Oh.
6537406	6539788	But I was there back when Tech TV was still around.
6540028	6540848	I remember that.
6540908	6542329	I remember you came to the show.
6542349	6543550	Do you remember what episode number that was?
6544651	6551234	I don't remember off the top of my head, but it was like the year before G4 bought him out.
6552535	6554696	Okay, so it was probably in the low 100s, right?
6554877	6555557	About the time you were there?
6555577	6555657	Yeah.
6556405	6557626	Maybe 4.69, I'm trying to remember.
6557686	6558407	I know, everything's changed.
6558427	6560028	I mean, your format has changed.
6560088	6563311	I mean, Megas has changed his name, all that sort of stuff.
6563331	6563391	And...
6584235	6592359	And to be totally honest, you guys are lucky that the anniversary is happening today and not yesterday, because otherwise you'd be facing against a big hedgehog.
6593300	6594501	Wait, what's yesterday?
6595301	6595961	Sonic's birthday.
6597622	6604906	Well, you know, technically the show started on June 23rd, so yesterday was our birthday, but we celebrate it tonight because it's Sunday.
6605687	6606127	Exactly.
6607448	6608028	So there you go.
6610029	6611370	I was wondering, actually, Rob.
6611490	6611610	What?
6612731	6616834	Did you ever watch any of the big gaming cartoons way, way back in the 80s?
6617454	6619055	I watched the Super Mario Bros.
6619075	6624779	Super Show religiously every day after school and would also watch the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.
6624839	6625579	That was my show.
6625920	6628981	I didn't really watch Captain Anne or any of the other ones, but that was the one.
6629962	6631643	Did you know that stuff is on DVD now?
6631803	6633484	Yes, I have the second season on DVD.
6633544	6634345	I need to find the first.
6635424	6636786	You can probably find it on Amazon.
6637086	6638768	I really need to get the Zelda DVD too.
6638808	6640050	For some reason I just never bought it.
6640070	6644035	I've been busy watching all these other shows but I definitely want the Zelda DVD package as well.
6644659	6650563	I keep seeing that one every time I go on Amazon, so they keep recommending it to me, so you can probably find it easy.
6651503	6657927	You kind of brought up the whole tech TV thing, and you've been talking a lot about television.
6657947	6660469	I'm kind of curious, because it's funny, a lot has changed there.
6660869	6666593	Tell us really quick again, what would you say some of your experiences at the tech TV studios when you went?
6666613	6667954	What kind of stuff did you observe?
6668294	6670555	Did people seem to be enjoying themselves?
6670876	6673037	How was the tour when you went?
6673914	6681997	Well, basically what it was like was I basically went into the headquarters where the main shows were developed there.
6682997	6684377	I got to meet Adam Sessler.
6686658	6692900	I pretty much walked around where everybody's office space was, and I've still got a few Tech TV swag stuff.
6693520	6694641	That's pretty rad, man.
6694741	6695941	Those are collector's things now.
6696696	6697076	I know.
6697337	6706644	And then after that, I took a little shuttle over to the studio, and I sat in on an episode of The Screensavers.
6707144	6708105	Wow, that's great.
6709846	6710407	That's cool.
6710527	6713029	And it's kind of sad now that that show's gone.
6713229	6716211	My dad loved The Screensavers, too, and it was a really great show.
6716251	6718813	It's just kind of sad to see what happened in the end to all that stuff.
6718833	6721835	Actually, Leo and the gang, they're all still around.
6722316	6725658	They're just doing a show now called This Week in Tech.
6725798	6726279	Oh, yeah.
6727001	6729684	If you're in the podcasting biz, you know This Week in Tech.
6729744	6730164	It's huge.
6730184	6733367	It's a huge show.
6733627	6736370	VO also has a KFI show in California.
6736790	6741774	I'm glad to see he's still kicking because, you know, folks like him are the kind of folks that inspire us.
6742655	6743216	I know, and if...
6744119	6746620	G4 hadn't brought out Tech TV, I'd probably be working there now.
6769082	6771223	Happy 5th anniversary and a happy 5 more.
6771643	6772363	It's all good.
6772383	6773103	We know that things change.
6773123	6773544	Have a good one, buddy.
6773564	6773704	You too.
6773724	6773864	Bye-bye.
6796030	6801895	We've hit the two-hour mark, but of course that counts the bonus segment, which was a good ten minutes long, which the podcasters don't get to hear.
6801915	6803336	So we're going to take a few more calls?
6804337	6804737	A few more?
6805057	6805317	Okay.
6805578	6806278	All right, let's keep going.
6806298	6807939	Are you guys okay on time and everything?
6808080	6809621	Yeah, I've only got to work overtime.
6809921	6810421	Oh, I'm sorry.
6810481	6811062	No, it's cool.
6811142	6811502	I'm joking.
6811963	6812803	Tonight's a special night.
6813023	6814004	All right, Loki, your call.
6815746	6816646	Hello, who is this?
6818908	6819188	Hello.
6819428	6819849	Hello.
6820249	6821950	This is Dr. Papatskou City.
6822691	6823231	How's it going?
6824673	6825133	Just great.
6826071	6826472	Hooray!
6826552	6828033	More international listeners.
6828113	6829294	We love hearing from the international folks.
6829414	6833137	Let you know that I just love the show for the last year and a half.
6834117	6835318	Well, we really appreciate that.
6835518	6838280	Thank you very much for listening to us for the past year and a half.
6838621	6840262	Any highlights from our show?
6840282	6842924	Well, actually what I do have is a question.
6844805	6845266	Oh, what's that?
6847127	6848108	What's with the name?
6848568	6851791	I assume you did have an orange lounge?
6853032	6853192	No.
6854373	6854713	Where did that
6855511	6855911	You know what?
6855971	6867918	Very famous question we often get asked a lot, especially since we've started getting more listeners, since we moved into the general gaming chat, because anybody that played Mamani Games probably knows where the name comes from.
6867938	6871780	But Jamie, I'll let you take this one, because you helped come up with the name.
6872681	6874001	Oh, yeah, where we got our name from.
6875482	6880225	We were on the train coming into San Francisco for something.
6880665	6882246	We were going to the Metreon that day, right?
6883443	6892695	and we've been trying to think of all day a name for the station and when we came back, I was like, we should call it Orange Lounge Radio because it's Orange Lounge.
6893672	6894633	Music, Radio
6921918	6929160	And we're very thankful to Konami for not suing us for using the name, but I think they realized we gave them free advertising and still continue to do so for a long time.
6930340	6932841	And Orange Lounge Radio is different from Orange Lounge, so there you go.
6933761	6939062	Well, that just goes to show you that I have absolutely not a care for music games.
6939402	6940342	It's all good.
6940422	6942603	Some of our listeners don't, and that's just fine.
6942763	6944443	So, you know, we try to...
6947822	6949283	Sorry, Jamie was showing me a private message.
6949803	6950243	Don't do that.
6950283	6951364	You distract me during the show.
6951384	6967431	Yeah, but it just goes to show, you know, we love, you know, the fact that since we have done the merge, even though not everybody was supportive when we kind of did away with talking about Bomani, only talking about general gaming, I really love that we've kind of opened it up to a whole new audience as well, you know, and it's not just about the music games.
6968791	6969271	Okay, then.
6970092	6973934	Probably I'll give you a call the next time I get Santa Cruz and have a present for you guys.
6974474	6975054	Oh, sweet.
6975114	6975494	Thank you.
6975554	6976375	And I love Santa Cruz.
6976455	6977235	I love the boardwalk there.
6977990	6979130	We'll have to go to the arcades.
6979450	6980111	Awesome.
6980131	6981551	Oh, the arcades there are awesome.
6981611	6982751	They have discs of Tron.
6983231	6983631	Sweet.
6983711	6984151	They do.
6984351	6984912	They do.
6985252	6985532	All right.
6985552	6986612	Well, thank you very much for your call.
6986632	6987272	We appreciate it, buddy.
6987892	6988272	No worries.
6988292	6988792	See you later.
6988913	6989333	Bye-bye.
6990993	6992773	So refreshing to hear from the folks around the world.
6992833	6993334	It's so great.
6993754	6995374	How come we haven't had any Canadians tonight?
6996174	6996994	That's very strange.
6997034	6998135	We want Canadians to call next.
6998155	6998695	We want Canadians.
6999415	6999675	All right.
7000174	7001515	I declare there must be Canadians.
7001675	7008758	Not that we don't love the Argentina, the Mexico, the U.S., you know, but Europe might be asking a bit much because it's probably like what now?
7008798	7010579	It's like the sun's starting to rise over there.
7010960	7012000	But what about some Canadians?
7012020	7013181	I know there's got to be a few listening.
7013661	7014601	All right, let's go to another call.
7014982	7015982	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7016002	7016322	Who's this?
7017423	7018443	Hello, this is Jaden.
7019484	7020004	I'm sorry, who?
7021325	7021705	Jaden.
7022405	7023226	Hi, what's on your mind?
7024286	7024807	Nothing much.
7024847	7027448	I just wanted to congratulate you on your fifth.
7028516	7029416	Well, thank you very much.
7029436	7029717	Appreciate it.
7029737	7030457	Are you my fifth beer?
7032198	7032478	Pardon?
7032918	7033318	Nothing.
7033458	7034418	I was saying my fifth beer.
7036439	7037840	I do that all the time.
7041841	7043622	Well, thank you very much.
7043702	7048204	Is there a particular something something that you want to share with the listeners tonight?
7049244	7050685	How long have you been listening to this show?
7052157	7061064	Um, let's see, I think this is going on my third Ah, awesome Well, what do you think has been a big, big game story that you really enjoyed our coverage on in the past three years?
7062625	7079817	Um, the anticipation of the Xbox 360 Ah, the anticipation of the Xbox 360 You know, I wasn't sold on the Xbox 360 at first I really wasn't And also the introduction of new systems in general
7080618	7089547	Oh, kind of like being able to kind of be watching this new wave of the whole next-gen systems, kind of watch this unfold, because, you know, all these systems didn't exist.
7089607	7092129	The PS3, the Wii, the 360 back when we started.
7092169	7094872	Hell, I don't even think the Xbox existed when we first started.
7095192	7096473	Or maybe it had just come out.
7096533	7096914	I don't know.
7097194	7098235	I think it was out.
7098495	7099696	When did the Xbox come out?
7099716	7099696	2001?
7099736	7101538	So maybe it was just out.
7102158	7104080	But anyway, yeah, we kind of got to watch this all unfold.
7104641	7105121	Loki, what...
7106442	7108724	You bought a 360 the day they came out, right?
7108744	7108824	No.
7109404	7110645	You bought a bidded one.
7110685	7112146	You eBayed one or something, didn't you?
7112186	7113107	I bought it off Craigslist.
7113447	7115949	Oh, I remember getting so mad at you about that.
7116349	7117450	But why did you do it?
7117530	7118290	Was it the hype?
7118371	7119131	Was it the games?
7119751	7120952	I just wanted to talk about it.
7121453	7122613	And I'm crazy.
7123314	7125756	Very crazy when it comes to talking about games and stuff.
7125816	7126996	I don't know.
7127056	7129258	I just felt like I wanted one.
7130819	7131620	It was big.
7132140	7135202	I got to keep my edge at work, you know?
7136240	7138782	You know what sold me on Xbox 360, sad but true?
7139583	7140423	Geometry Wars.
7141564	7143166	And Xbox Live Arcade in general.
7143326	7146528	I was like, this is the coolest thing ever.
7147109	7149711	It wasn't even any of the launch games that I really cared about.
7149731	7153334	Although I did buy Cameo and I don't know what else I bought at launch.
7153774	7155296	But it was Xbox Live Arcade.
7155516	7156917	I bought Cameo, Ridge Racer 6.
7157758	7164223	Actually, I pretty much bought almost everything that came out at launch between launch and March.
7164813	7185962	I think one of the big ones I bought was Call of Duty 2, and then I bought Project Gotham Racing 3, also Cameo, and then Perfect Dark Zero, and I bought almost everything that came out at launch.
7187563	7190044	Caller, did you get in on the Xbox 360 craze?
7191225	7191885	No, I didn't.
7192865	7194046	You didn't buy one until way later, huh?
7194485	7202212	No, I don't have one Because I'm not an Xbox person I'm a Nintendo person No No, I'm not that crazy I thought about it at one point in time, but
7217844	7218304	Thank you for watching!
7237499	7238940	Over on Sunrise.
7239200	7239861	That's where we were.
7239901	7241121	That was awesome.
7241141	7242822	And we had a listener of the show on the line.
7243342	7244083	A couple.
7244403	7246064	I want to know if any of them are still listening.
7246324	7247485	For the love of God, email us.
7247525	7248645	Let's get together and play Wii sometime.
7248665	7251247	I want to know who the girl who got the Wii hat was.
7252029	7255170	DarkSakura's reaction to the DS, something that shares your namesake.
7255190	7255730	Do you approve?
7282418	7283098	I guess.
7283238	7284599	It's almost as cool as me.
7285059	7287100	Do you remember when we went and bought our DS?
7287740	7294263	We went to Best Buy, bought them there, and then we also went to Benihana's afterwards for lunch.
7294983	7297484	That is the most money I've ever spent in a single day, probably.
7297704	7302586	I found Dan's box for his DS, because they all got theirs at GameStop before launch date, of course.
7303106	7305487	And it said, this DS is reserved for Dan.
7305607	7306768	If you touch it, you die.
7307308	7309009	I won't forget the first time... The post-it's still on the box.
7309129	7311850	The first PSP I bought, I bought it, and then I...
7313052	7313152	Nope.
7313172	7314073	Other than... Other than the...
7341309	7346991	The one episode that really sticks out to me because I have a recording of it is 120.
7347131	7349071	What's so special about 120?
7349611	7352912	You'll have to forgive us, but they all start to blend together when you've been doing it for five years.
7354553	7361735	Because one of the big things is that Loki was called the Xbox 2 at the time.
7363335	7363636	Did he?
7364436	7366036	Well, he probably didn't have a name then.
7366576	7368717	Did it have a name or was he just being dumb?
7370216	7374418	They didn't have a name for it, but he mentioned it several times.
7375098	7375559	Interesting.
7375999	7376979	Well, shit.
7377059	7380681	I mean, if they don't have a name for it yet, obviously it's going to be the Xbox 2.
7381061	7385484	But it's funny to go back and listen to what we thought about things before they actually came out.
7385644	7391507	I think they're going to be stupid and name it 360 because it'll be circular.
7391567	7391967	I don't know.
7393341	7394841	You called the PS3 name, right?
7395362	7397942	Well, yeah, because they didn't innovate on their name.
7398682	7400403	We're going to put a 3 on there.
7400743	7401383	Yeah.
7401763	7402103	Alright.
7402483	7405164	Caller, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling.
7405924	7406744	Yep, sure, anytime.
7406784	7407224	Alright, later.
7408285	7408945	Alright, bye.
7409085	7409285	Bye.
7410345	7411886	Alright, let's do a few more calls.
7412026	7413226	Now it's starting to trickle up a little bit.
7413266	7417167	We still have some people hammering us that have been since the beginning, so we'll get to everybody.
7417207	7418947	We're going to keep calling until the calls stop coming in.
7420008	7421908	Or we pass out tired, whichever happens first.
7422881	7424344	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
7425567	7427772	Token Canadian calling in.
7427852	7430197	Hi, what's your name for those who don't know?
7430818	7431860	It's Toshin, what's up guys?
7431880	7433344	Toshin, what's up?
7433644	7433825	See?
7434682	7436043	Ask and ye shall receive.
7436083	7437323	We got a Canadian on the line.
7437423	7438263	Yay, thank you.
7439404	7440184	What else can I do?
7440204	7441344	I don't know.
7441665	7443505	Do a cartwheel or say a boot.
7443905	7444365	No, I'm kidding.
7444786	7445406	I'm totally kidding.
7445426	7446146	I'll bring pizza or something.
7446186	7446486	I don't know.
7447727	7450468	Toshin, dude, anything you want to say?
7450528	7453749	Are you only calling in because we forced you to or is there anything you want to say or ask or what?
7454449	7454869	No, no, no.
7454909	7457770	I want to be like everybody else and congratulate you on the five years.
7458250	7458631	Appreciate it.
7458851	7462692	Probably not the longest call or listener, but I've been around for a while and
7463243	7467004	I just haven't had the nerve to jump in the chat room as much as I should.
7468245	7471205	Because you were on DDR Freak like several years ago.
7471265	7472626	You've been posting there a while, right?
7473306	7476447	Yeah, we've got a small little thread for our DDR people.
7476787	7477087	Sweet.
7477427	7486650	And the reason why I mention that is because obviously when our show first started, a large, large contingent of our listeners were all DDR Freak members and people from that community.
7486730	7489411	So, you know, I do remember seeing your face around there back in the day, so.
7490285	7494269	Yeah, the small little Nova Scotia thread for anybody who wants to go check it out.
7494689	7495570	We still got some life.
7496671	7499653	And the machines have not frozen over, contrary to popular belief.
7500554	7501355	No, they're not.
7501815	7506460	But we gotta deal with some of the machines' issues, because they're in bad, bad shape.
7506980	7509843	You know what my favorite thread on DDR Freak was always?
7510523	7510703	What?
7510723	7512125	Was the Antarctica thread.
7513526	7514447	Yeah, that was pretty funny.
7515680	7516460	Thanks for watching!
7545248	7545748	Exactly.
7546068	7548269	Well, Toshin, thanks for answering the call.
7548309	7548889	We appreciate it.
7549449	7550789	Any other last things you want to say?
7550809	7557691	I want to just... How are you doing with... I know you've played DDR and B-Money for a while.
7557771	7560031	What's your favorite game that you've played throughout the years?
7560151	7563692	Is it just like B-Money or DDR Stepping?
7563992	7567193	My favorite music game that I've played in the past five years?
7567693	7567953	Yeah.
7568473	7571774	Absolutely, without a doubt, Beatmania 2DX8 style in the arcade.
7572461	7573062	Oh, sexy.
7590425	7593726	and those that know me well know what a big ham I am.
7594366	7596667	One of my favorite things to do is host.
7596687	7601789	When I was young, I always wanted to be a game show host, if it's not completely obvious through some of the things that happen on this show.
7603049	7607090	That's part of the reason I continue to be an MC-ish sort of role on this show.
7607510	7609351	I love doing that kind of stuff at tournaments.
7609791	7617395	and running the Beatmania 2DX tournament, one of the very few that's ever been run, being able to run that tournament on that 8-style machine at Scandia was a dream.
7617495	7619596	And the mix itself was awesome.
7619636	7624578	The music that was in it and everything, just really the peak of the 2DX series for me.
7625560	7629304	So are you planning to get distorted and stuff in the coming weeks?
7629444	7633968	Well, like I said, 8th was kind of the peak, and my interest in the series has kind of waned since then.
7634249	7639314	I mean, I will always love the game, and I can't justify spending $80 on it.
7639354	7640335	Not now, not right now.
7640355	7643838	You can always... No, but I don't go there, you know.
7645320	7645640	I don't know.
7646301	7647462	Import, man, come on.
7648355	7652458	I import straight to my hard drive.
7652658	7655200	The Rob D says from Bob Barker to Rob Roberts.
7655300	7656261	Dude, that would be my dream.
7656401	7663486	I actually secretly in the back of my mind, I secretly wish that they would do like an American Idol style show to replace him because I would so go there.
7664347	7665288	You know what we have to hear now?
7665808	7666709	We have to hear that song.
7667869	7668890	The Come On Down?
7669491	7669771	Yes.
7670551	7672893	Maybe later in the show because I don't have it queued up right now.
7673614	7675435	You never have it queued up at this time though.
7676638	7677358	It's getting late.
7677378	7677959	Give me a break.
7678779	7679379	I need more pizza.
7679600	7679880	All right.
7680540	7681100	We ate it all.
7681160	7681721	It's all gone.
7681841	7683221	The three of us ate the whole damn pizza.
7683922	7684382	A large.
7684642	7685563	We're piggies.
7686663	7687163	Oh, my God.
7687304	7687564	All right.
7688544	7689064	Bye, Tosha.
7689084	7689785	Thanks so much for the call.
7689805	7690365	We appreciate it.
7690425	7690665	Yeah.
7691186	7691886	Happy 5th, guys.
7691946	7692166	All right.
7692206	7692646	Thank you.
7693027	7693467	Take care, buddy.
7695208	7695628	Love that.
7696249	7698711	Ask for a Canadian and you shall receive a Canadian.
7699171	7708178	All right, we're well past the two-hour mark now, so we're going to go into the two-minute lightning round, and now all our calls are going to be wrapped up in two minutes or less.
7708238	7711220	So here we go, starting off, and Jamie, your call.
7711980	7712281	What?
7714522	7714863	Hello?
7715523	7715883	Hello.
7715963	7716304	Hi.
7717044	7718025	Hi, it's the Afro guy.
7718725	7719086	Hi.
7719106	7719146	Hi.
7719646	7720867	Hi.
7721809	7724411	What's on your mind, Afro guy?
7724811	7725812	Hi.
7725892	7727213	Turn down your speakers, buddy.
7728754	7729394	Ah, sorry.
7729574	7731236	That's okay.
7732476	7733537	Are you calling us from the UK?
7734258	7734618	Yeah.
7734998	7735819	Ah, I knew it.
7735839	7736880	I could tell from the accent.
7736920	7737780	That's amazing.
7738801	7739982	And I recognize your name, too.
7740282	7742563	Wow, so you're like, it's early morning.
7743424	7744845	It's almost six in the morning, yeah.
7744865	7745305	You are hard.
7745385	7746746	What are you doing awake?
7748768	7750189	Listening to the fifth anniversary show.
7751195	7752836	Well, we appreciate you tuning in.
7753056	7755096	You are a hardcore fan, sir.
7756817	7759238	I wish we weren't in the two-minute lightning round at this point.
7759278	7760058	What do you want to say?
7761058	7763799	I just want to say thanks for doing the show for five years.
7764419	7767220	I mean, I've only been listening for about two years since you started the podcast.
7767740	7768481	Well, you're welcome.
7768781	7774623	I mean, we do this for folks like you that continue to listen in, and especially around the world.
7774683	7778324	That blows my mind how the Internet brings us that closer together as gaming fans.
7780655	7780915	Great.
7781075	7783797	Well, now I've cooled in, I think I'm going to go to bed.
7784437	7785858	I'm so tired.
7785918	7787039	I say that's a good call.
7787059	7787719	Sleep in today.
7787820	7788400	Sleep well.
7788440	7789421	You've earned it, my friend.
7790401	7790841	Thank you.
7791022	7791242	All right.
7791262	7791922	Have a good one, buddy.
7792562	7793123	All right.
7793323	7793903	See you.
7793923	7794143	Bye.
7796485	7799327	Poor neighbors, because you must be blasting the show at 6 a.m.
7799387	7799687	over there.
7800506	7801906	because we're hearing it on the speakers.
7802326	7804987	Unless he had a room with an echo, could be.
7805487	7806428	Yeah, it could be.
7806728	7807488	He's trying to keep it down.
7807528	7807788	I don't know.
7807808	7808048	Who knows?
7808348	7809388	All right, two-minute lightning round.
7809408	7810189	Let's take some more calls.
7810469	7811449	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7811469	7811769	Who's this?
7813990	7814370	Hello?
7815510	7815650	Hi.
7815770	7816650	You got through finally.
7816670	7817030	Who is this?
7817050	7818851	Nintendo Maniac 64.
7819491	7821112	Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.
7821172	7821772	What's on your mind?
7824773	7826233	I don't know.
7826613	7827833	I guess I'm on the opposite.
7827973	7829034	It's not early morning.
7829134	7829794	It's early...
7830487	7833688	It's kind of late night, 1253 AM here.
7834408	7841771	It's about 10 PM here, so we're getting pretty late even for California time, but that's okay.
7841831	7842391	What's on your mind?
7844312	7848993	One thing I remember is something someone said.
7849393	7851914	It was about like your first game and stuff that you played.
7852775	7857076	In all honesty, my very first game, I was like three or four something, was Mortal Kombat.
7858140	7860601	Your first game was Mortal Kombat?
7861141	7862502	And I didn't even know what it was.
7863683	7866444	Was it the version where they replaced the blood with the sweat, though?
7866504	7867224	Because that doesn't count.
7867244	7868625	No, it was the Genesis version.
7869145	7870366	Oh, it was the Genesis version.
7870406	7871606	So did you put in the blood code?
7873547	7874008	I don't know.
7875228	7876069	Only like three or four.
7876369	7878930	I didn't have my own game system until I was like...
7879810	7882913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7902482	7903423	Uh, no.
7903763	7909968	So, well, I'm just trying to say that, you know, exposing, you know, kids to violent games doesn't necessarily make them murderers.
7911268	7911629	That's all.
7912609	7913930	All right, anything else you want to share with listeners?
7915091	7922256	Uh, oh, I finally got my own pretty good computer rig now, not like a 533 megahertz PC.
7922556	7926059	God, I thought he was going to say I got my own podcast.
7926139	7927100	I don't have a podcast.
7927460	7928641	All right, that's all right.
7928961	7931643	Two minutes is up, buddy, but thanks so much for the call and take care, okay?
7932423	7932743	Okay.
7932903	7933484	Alright, bye-bye.
7934244	7934484	Bye.
7935285	7936566	Alright, let's go to another call.
7937166	7939488	These poor people have been trying to get in all night long.
7939528	7940328	We gotta get their calls.
7940348	7941189	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
7941209	7941529	Who's this?
7942530	7943310	I don't know.
7943891	7944531	It's Dark Knight.
7945132	7946713	Oh, we can barely, barely hear you.
7946753	7947894	Get a little closer to your night.
7947974	7949535	Yes, Dark Knight, but we can barely hear him.
7950255	7950595	Hello?
7951316	7951556	Hey.
7952137	7952977	Hey, what's on your mind?
7954258	7956059	Um, quick, um, quick shout-out.
7956920	7957340	Um, what?
7957900	7960062	Um, congratulate y'all guys on five years.
7960820	7965043	and hopefully y'all do five more years while y'all still around and everything like that.
7965684	7972770	And to back talk the gaming thing, my first gaming system was the Atari 2600.
7973990	7975031	Yeah, mine too.
7975512	7975972	Preach on.
7976152	7977593	Atari 2600 was awesome.
7977934	7980295	We'll try to do another five years if we can.
7980355	7982137	We're going to keep going until we're out of gas.
7984091	7986413	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8014079	8019803	Well, Dark Knight, our time is halfway up, but I've got to ask you real quickly, is there anything that you want to share?
8019863	8022025	Because I know you've been a long-time listener of Orange Laundry.
8022045	8024066	I recognize your name from chat from years ago.
8024726	8025687	Is there a favorite moment?
8027428	8031111	Loki getting drunk and parents calling the show.
8031131	8032552	Oh, when our parents have called in?
8033552	8035134	Yeah, and Loki's was the best one.
8035934	8037495	Loki had the best parent call.
8038396	8040757	Yeah, because it was sister that called.
8041258	8041478	Mm-hmm.
8042483	8044824	and then next thing you know it was the parents behind her.
8046365	8047165	I remember that.
8047185	8048246	Parents and grandparents, yeah.
8048366	8049026	That was good.
8049607	8050727	Dark Knight, our time's almost up.
8050867	8051848	Quick, any last minute thoughts?
8053269	8057871	No, just want to say happy five years, OLR, and keep it rocking, guys.
8058031	8059031	All right, we will do, buddy.
8059051	8060872	Thanks so much for your support over the past five years.
8060912	8061473	We appreciate it.
8061853	8062193	Thank you.
8062373	8062713	Bye-bye.
8063834	8065515	He got progressively louder as the call went on.
8065575	8066155	Very nice job.
8066355	8066955	Appreciate that.
8067015	8068776	He started to turn the volume up or something.
8069337	8069977	Loki, your call.
8071158	8072599	Hello, this is Orange Launch Radio.
8072639	8073019	Who is this?
8074420	8075621	Hey, it's SSJ1.
8076762	8077403	Hey, how's it going?
8078624	8080025	It's really got in, it looks like.
8083007	8086730	I just want to wish you guys a happy fifth birthday, I guess.
8089092	8093575	And I also want to thank Rob for coming out to New York and having a great time with us.
8094355	8095356	I had an awesome time.
8095676	8097657	It was so much better this year than last year.
8097697	8098818	And no offense against last year.
8098958	8104922	I mean, we did our thing and had fun, but that was more of a me thing because I had more time this year to actually go around and do stuff.
8105383	8108705	And the stuff we did this year was going to Dave & Buster's and going to that video game shop.
8108745	8110526	It was just like we were buds hanging out.
8110626	8111087	It was a good time.
8111107	8111927	I had a really good time.
8112528	8113088	It was great.
8113188	8114949	And, you know, that's how gamers should be.
8115209	8119973	And, you know, OR, we're just one big family.
8120293	8121854	And that's how we should always be.
8122589	8122829	Awesome.
8122849	8132555	Well, hey, since you're in New York, or at least the New York area, if a gamer is thinking of visiting the area, because New York is a huge tourist spot, where are some places they must go in New York?
8135117	8147964	You know, I've just moved back here, but, you know, big New York places, I would say go to the forums, because, you know, the locals really know where the good places are.
8147984	8149806	You know, there's a lot of places...
8151107	8151847	what about Nintendo World Store
8172503	8173924	Well, yeah, Nintendo World Store is great.
8174044	8177986	I mean, I thought you meant, like, arcades type stuff.
8178046	8178606	No, that's true.
8178646	8179066	That's true.
8179386	8187370	And those are good stuff to point out, too, because, you know, certain people, when they try, you know, they want to find that local fighting game or dance game community or whatever it is.
8187850	8189131	SJ100, Matt, our time is up.
8189791	8191272	Real, real quickly, last minute thoughts.
8192353	8194714	Well, no, I, you know, I've been trying to call in all night.
8194754	8196254	I wanted to ask this one question.
8196755	8199376	You know, you guys have been on for five years, and
8200123	8205547	What would be the one thing you would like to accomplish within the next five years?
8208589	8210550	Big question, so I'm going to let someone else start off.
8210670	8212992	What would be the one thing you'd like to accomplish in the next five years?
8213873	8214413	With the show?
8217195	8218796	With the show or in general or what?
8219737	8222078	With the show.
8223840	8226862	I would really call this ambitious.
8227762	8233167	But I would really like to not only do this internet-based, but do it satellite-based as well.
8235589	8235869	Loki?
8236910	8241113	To have my wife approve of the show.
8241994	8243075	That's a big one, right?
8243095	8244656	That's a very lofty goal right there.
8245437	8252203	I'm going to be a little bit controversial because I know how Jamie feels about this idea, but I'm going to say video.
8254384	8255906	That would be cool, you know.
8256753	8259674	And I think you know, Rob, that I'm kind of in that business.
8260194	8263356	If you guys ever need someone to shoot it or direct it, I'm here.
8264296	8265537	Help me talk Jamie into it.
8265577	8266457	That's what you've got to help me do.
8268418	8269518	All right, we've really got to let you go.
8269598	8270219	We're over time.
8270259	8271559	But take care, buddy.
8271719	8272260	Thanks so much.
8272560	8273340	Take it easy, guys.
8273420	8273740	Bye-bye.
8275141	8276241	All right, I think it's slowing down.
8276281	8277482	I think we've only got a couple calls left.
8277502	8279383	But I really want to give a chance for everybody to get through.
8280423	8281183	Jamie, how about you?
8282004	8282944	Hello.
8282964	8285085	Hello.
8286121	8286581	Who be?
8288423	8289744	This is Wonder Dog Harold.
8290164	8290804	Hi!
8290824	8293026	Hello.
8293786	8295107	What do you have to say to us?
8295788	8296988	What do you have to say for yourself?
8298910	8301171	Congratulations on your 5th anniversary.
8301452	8302332	Thank you.
8302933	8303993	Did you get us a present?
8305875	8309197	No, like the customary gift for the 5th anniversary is this.
8309217	8309477	Is what?
8310258	8310678	It's wood.
8312079	8312579	It's wood.
8312979	8313640	It's wood.
8315239	8315859	I got wood.
8317440	8318360	I have no wood.
8318380	8319061	There you go.
8320001	8320782	No gift needed.
8320882	8323583	Will you try to get some wood for our fifth anniversary?
8326264	8326644	Maybe.
8326864	8327285	All right.
8328205	8331206	Is there a game out there that gives you wood?
8333968	8334248	No.
8334568	8334748	No?
8335788	8340411	That's good because, you know, that would be maybe crossing the line a bit.
8340651	8340851	Really?
8340871	8343492	There's been no game character ever that might give you a little wood?
8345200	8345440	No.
8345761	8347782	My first video game crush was Ryu from Street Fighter 2.
8347882	8348022	What?
8348042	8348743	No, I tried to, like, like...
8370509	8372169	Dick and Tingle in there real quick.
8372189	8373370	Oh, Tingle, Tingle.
8373390	8375110	No, this was when I was in high school.
8377071	8377591	I gotcha.
8377971	8380211	Loki, any character ever given you wood?
8381132	8381312	No.
8381732	8382432	No Dead or Alive?
8382452	8383212	No.
8384412	8388633	Somebody in our chat room is trying to start a petition for Dead or Alive Extreme Volleyball with men.
8389253	8391074	So, I don't know about that one.
8391454	8393634	All right, any last minute thoughts, caller?
8395515	8395715	Nope.
8396275	8398876	All right, well, you're a man of many words, Wonder Dog Carol.
8399096	8399896	Thanks so much for the call.
8399936	8400116	As usual.
8400723	8401483	Take care, buddy.
8402784	8403144	Bye-bye.
8403324	8403604	Bye.
8405945	8408826	Remember when he called in the match game a few weeks ago and was giving all one word answers?
8409326	8411427	I think the phone lines may have stopped.
8411687	8413088	There's no calls coming in right now.
8413148	8415028	Let me give it just a few more minutes to make sure.
8415048	8416069	And then we're going to call.
8416089	8416649	Oh, there it is.
8416729	8417189	Here's one more.
8417909	8418570	This is going to be the last.
8418590	8419910	You had to encourage them, Rob.
8419930	8420791	This is the last call.
8420831	8421311	Last call.
8421591	8422071	Sorry, guys.
8423071	8425932	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and this is the last call of the night.
8425992	8426373	Who's this?
8427053	8428153	Oh, my God.
8429374	8429854	Who is this?
8430905	8433766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8461081	8473702	I mean, I'm sorry, I'm speechless, you know, I'm the biggest fangirl of the show is interested in me and well, you know.
8474855	8475575	Oh my god.
8475815	8486779	I forgot, this show has helped facilitate a few OL relationships, which has been very interesting how that community, just communities in general, can have that effect.
8487079	8490840	I've met a few people I've dated through live journals in that community.
8490880	8496982	I can't say I've ever met anyone in a gaming-related community, but it's just interesting the way that works.
8497382	8500283	But DT, you've been here for the whole thing.
8500943	8503344	What would you say was the highlight of the past five years?
8504480	8505660	Oh my god, I don't know.
8506500	8512102	Aside from that thing on 230, I'd probably have to go with Loki singing.
8513842	8517843	Isn't it amazing that after all these years, they still say that's their favorite moment?
8518243	8519423	That was awful!
8520103	8522384	I'm never doing it again, so like it.
8524124	8525504	Live it up while it lasts.
8526205	8528245	I'm calling in.
8528265	8532406	I want the host to know I like their show.
8536881	8537342	Whatever.
8538742	8541343	Oh, DarkTetsuya, thank you for making it all worth it.
8541363	8542224	That was wonderful.
8543924	8546946	I do have a quick FU, though.
8547326	8547646	All right.
8548166	8551067	I don't know, DT, because that's like the perfect note to end on.
8551107	8552848	But if you must, go for it.
8553048	8553308	FU.
8554569	8559051	FU to Burger King, because Missy has to work tonight.
8559291	8560311	FU to work in general.
8560351	8562192	Let's quit our jobs and move into the fort.
8563450	8563950	Yeah.
8565071	8566091	The OLR Fort.
8567611	8569772	Dark Tetsuya, thank you so much for the call.
8569812	8570512	We appreciate it.
8570872	8572313	And you fucking won, by the way.
8572373	8573893	Out of all the callers tonight, you won.
8574073	8574713	Congratulations.
8575574	8575974	Thank you.
8576234	8576694	Take care.
8581075	8582116	I'm calling in.
8583616	8586657	I now demand that all future call-ins begin with that.
8589875	8597983	Well guys, the calls have finally slowed down, but if we didn't get to you, we're so sorry that we didn't make your phone call.
8600205	8606091	Obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, and even to the podcast listeners and those that weren't able to tune in live tonight and listen to us and be a part of this show.
8606591	8607291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8636786	8637367	Fuck everything.
8637767	8638508	I'm just going to do the show.
8638848	8639328	I'll try.
8639669	8640610	Thank you, guys.
8641871	8644673	And thank you for the five people who've sent me a dollar, by the way.
8645774	8648076	There's not going to be a pump up the volume, though, on Tuesday.
8648116	8658406	This is very important because Live 365 is doing a day of broadcasting silence to protest whoever those fuckheads are that are doing all this bullshit to internet radio.
8658586	8659046	The government.
8659167	8659487	Yeah.
8659647	8660608	Like I said, fuckheads.
8661207	8665316	So no Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday, no nothing on Tuesday.
8666298	8666758	However...
8667543	8671225	You best hold on to your pants on Wednesday because Rob's going to be on, right?
8671425	8672746	That's right.
8672826	8677909	The door is always open for you, DarkSakura, if you want to come in and get a little revenge on Wednesday since you can have a Tuesday show.
8677989	8678969	I don't know what you've got going on.
8678989	8679430	We'll see.
8679570	8680830	Oh wait, no, there is no show Wednesday.
8680871	8681731	I'm in Malibu Wednesday.
8681891	8682291	I can't go.
8682351	8682631	Bitch!
8683232	8684332	So maybe you can do your show Wednesday.
8684453	8685233	Keep me.
8685293	8687614	And then drop me off in LA so I can go to Disneyland.
8687634	8688115	We'll talk offline.
8688135	8689876	I'm seeing Transformers on Wednesday.
8692697	8701180	Jamie reminded me, there are some thank yous that are badly, badly needed because there's like specific individuals we have to thank because they've really made the five years worth it.
8701200	8703721	And please, you know, God, it's just like an Oscar speech.
8703761	8704922	We're afraid we're going to forget somebody.
8704942	8705622	But if you guys think...
8706403	8706923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8729612	8734455	The man just does this because he wants to and he loves what we're doing.
8734555	8737456	And without him, we would not be able to accomplish half of what we have.
8737857	8740118	So VXJasonXV, you are the man.
8740418	8741979	Thank you so much for all of your help.
8742299	8751544	Even though we joke that the chat room is the invisible fourth host of Orange Lingerie, Jason is like this invisible thing that you don't always see on the air that's really holding this show up.
8751604	8753905	So thank you so much to Jason, first and foremost.
8754605	8755366	I also want to say...
8756374	8770027	A big thank you to Travis Donovan of Travis Donovan Live because he kind of got me into the whole internet broadcasting thing and Jamie to some extent because obviously Under Station Live was the show we were doing before Orange Lounge Radio.
8770107	8771188	I was the number one guest.
8771609	8779477	I don't think Travis really approved of this side project in the beginning because he saw it as maybe taking away from Under Station Live or what have you, but...
8780037	8780518	Thanks for watching!
8795072	8810425	I want to say a big thank you as well to Bobby Blackwolf and Scott and Lawrence and everybody over at allgames.com for enabling our show to a whole new audience because obviously signing up with allgames.com was one of the best moves we ever made in trying to grab ourselves some rabid fans.
8810565	8813808	We just love the fact that our fan bases have kind of clicked in that way.
8814188	8821195	And while not everybody on All Games May Like Our Show, those that have, we're very lucky to have over here listening to OLR as well.
8821556	8826901	And we want to thank you guys for helping us get on board with the syndication over there and opening everything up over there.
8829324	8830545	God, I don't even...
8831408	8844558	So many, I mean, obviously each and every person that's ever listened to a live show, ever downloaded a podcast, everybody that's authored stories for the website, Mel B, Dark Tetsuya, Jimmy, DMN, anybody that's been a part of like OLR staff.
8844918	8849762	I want to thank Chris for a lot over the past few years.
8849822	8850742	God, who am I forgetting?
8851063	8851403	Anybody?
8853605	8854005	Anything?
8855186	8856187	And viewers like you.
8857427	8857988	I mean listeners.
8858354	8863840	Alright, and if I left you out, I'm very, very sorry, but it was kind of like a last minute thing I wanted to bring up.
8865601	8867023	Loki, do you have anything you want to say?
8867603	8868805	Not until the afterbirth.
8869826	8870847	Okay, we'll leave it at that.
8872125	8877487	Loki, by the way, was not an official host of Orange Launch Radio for the first 20 episodes, but you know what?
8877507	8880848	He never missed a show and had that dedication, and it's very interesting.
8881228	8889310	I didn't even freaking know Loki, really, before this show started, but now it's just, you know... I drove you down to Golf Land, dude!
8889370	8894532	But that was like... But it wasn't... Like, we didn't... You know, we didn't really know each other, like, at that point.
8894572	8896852	You know, I feel like I didn't really get to know you until this show.
8896892	8899453	Like, I know who you were, and obviously you did a lot of nice things...
8900485	8910491	That's what I want to say about Loki is that I know a lot of you think he's a total dick based on the things that he says about Max and stuff, but he's actually one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet offline, and I'm sorry for ruining your internet persona.
8910511	8911672	Whatever.
8911832	8912552	But he really is.
8912572	8913433	I don't have a persona.
8914293	8921618	And Jamie, too, because I know she has sometimes the internet persona of being the Queen Bee on Orange Light Radio.
8921778	8922298	I know.
8923079	8925420	But she's really got a softy heart, too.
8925460	8926821	You just don't always see it on the show.
8926981	8927281	You do.
8927341	8928562	It's made of sponge.
8929062	8929883	No, it's not.
8931557	8932578	It's plasmoid.
8932878	8936441	It's a plasma, which means the electrons are charged and it's fiery.
8937321	8938422	I have a fiery heart.
8941284	8942846	Okay.
8943666	8944547	Now, one more thing.
8945517	8958484	Not everybody got to get through on the Skype line tonight, but this was the interesting thing is that I logged into Skype today and there were voicemails waiting for us congratulating us on the fifth anniversary from people who wouldn't necessarily be able to be here on the show tonight.
8959024	8962226	And so I hopped into chat and I said, well, looks like we have some voicemails.
8962266	8963167	Anyone want to add some?
8963527	8964728	And we had some folks call in.
8965068	8970231	And so we're going to end it on this sound clip and then we're going to kind of wrap it up and be out of here.
8970511	8971011	Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
8971231	8972892	You want to do some last minute game stories before we get to that?
8973690	8976692	Oh, yeah, real quick, just real quick.
8977453	8988200	There's a brand new hack in the PSP world that allows homebrew on any firmware so far, all the way up to 3.5.
8988941	8994084	And funny enough, it does not use Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, but it uses Luminous.
8994504	8999768	And it's a Luminati workaround or whatever, exploit, I guess they're calling it.
9000228	9002710	But very interesting to see that.
9003092	9007878	After all this time, Luminous can now allow you to run homebrew.
9009099	9010501	It was there the whole time.
9010541	9011802	It's almost like a mystery novel.
9013884	9016928	Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail.
9017248	9017669	Is that it?
9017689	9021073	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
9021193	9022174	Until the afterbirth.
9022414	9023796	Let's get to the voicemails, folks.
9033604	9037526	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio, 5th Anniversary Show.
9037726	9042008	I am Insanus, the guy who does the show on Thursday.
9042028	9052493	I want to call you guys, wish you all a happy, happy, happy 5th Anniversary from everybody here at the Insanus Hour, which right now is me and four listeners.
9053453	9054634	So, yeah.
9056515	9057055	But, um...
9058306	9065128	On behalf of everybody in the chat room right now, everyone is wanting to call you guys and wish you a happy OLR 5th anniversary.
9066788	9078072	Rob, Jamie, Matt, thanks for letting me have an evening on the station where I can say as many curse words as I like and enjoy myself.
9078092	9079652	You guys are the reason I love doing this.
9079812	9081373	I got started because of you guys.
9081413	9084674	You probably have heard this shit sometimes before, but it's true.
9085234	9086114	You guys are awesome.
9086579	9094223	Hopefully soon here I'll be in Sacramento and we will all have a good, good time.
9094744	9096785	But let's just hope Rob keeps his pants on.
9097205	9102168	Jamie doesn't beat me with a ferret and Matt doesn't throw an iPhone at me.
9103369	9114095	Anyways guys, this is a long voice mail and I think I should stop talking like this because I think I'm pissing you all off.
9115106	9116986	Also, Rob, your mom called.
9117246	9118567	She's still just as lonely as you.
9118847	9122467	And my mom called, and she's still as lonely as you.
9122487	9123067	Okay, I'm done.
9123087	9124908	Bye.
9126328	9128428	Hello, Iron Clones Radio folks.
9128668	9129929	It's, uh, Scott.
9129969	9133009	So, I don't remember what my screen name is on the LLR.
9133469	9133989	Hi, Rob.
9134229	9134689	Hi, Jamie.
9134710	9138870	Well, I talk to people all the time on MySpace and Xbox Live.
9139170	9139770	Rob, it's me.
9139830	9140971	Yes, anyway.
9143854	9144975	Wow, five years.
9145115	9146216	Happy anniversary!
9146596	9150799	Um, oh my, you know, the worst half, better half.
9151220	9153101	Um, well, I got to listen to you people.
9153722	9157184	Um, yeah, uh, well, we wanted to say hello.
9157204	9158005	Say hello.
9158025	9159386	Hello.
9159426	9161548	Yeah, that would be good.
9162148	9164390	He's more lesbian than the official lesbian.
9165171	9166252	Well, more girl.
9166332	9173037	Anyway, um, wow, five years of gaming goodness and listening to Loki bitch about women drivers.
9173978	9174518	It's all good.
9174799	9176800	Two, five more years at least.
9177680	9178901	Alright, bye.
9179341	9180221	Hey, it's Missy.
9180942	9182583	So, you know I had to call in, right?
9183643	9185364	It'd be a 15th anniversary and all.
9186545	9188065	Keep the work going.
9188285	9189286	Alright, call in live.
9190506	9191367	Yeah, let's see.
9191387	9192227	4-7-0-4.
9192508	9197490	So it's been three years and three months already.
9197510	9200952	Oh, that was a Wednesday too.
9200972	9203253	Wasn't it Vanilla Sky that was the Wednesday show then?
9204812	9206894	Anyway, congrats on five years.
9207934	9213918	And I'll be thinking about you when the number works.
9214098	9214659	Bye.
9215039	9217841	Hey, what's up?
9218621	9220362	This is Tiger Claw.
9220382	9224285	I would like to wish Orange Lounge Radio a happy five-year anniversary.
9224685	9229048	I've been a long-time listener of the show since I first heard on allgames.com.
9229608	9231389	And here's hoping for five more years.
9231630	9232050	Take care.
9233154	9235316	Hey all alive, this is Mystic Gohan.
9236076	9240780	Congratulations on five years of podcasting, I guess.
9240800	9246825	I have a question about, I saw Sky on Xbox Live with the HD DVD player.
9247485	9250508	I was wondering if it's worth the buy because my brother kind of wants it.
9251208	9254451	And he's wondering if you could get a PS3 instead just for Blu-ray.
9255852	9258694	And yeah, you guys have been doing an awesome job.
9259685	9262646	I've been listening for about two years now.
9262906	9265646	You guys are just awesome.
9265666	9267727	Keep doing what you're doing.
9267747	9272628	Bye.
9285811	9286672	Really either one.
9286732	9291055	I mean, they say Blu-ray is winning, but I don't know if that's just marketing smoke and mirrors.
9291516	9292757	I think it's too early to tell.
9292877	9294698	Honestly, your safest bet is to not take the plunge yet.
9294738	9301724	Well, the reason why they're saying it's winning is because there's more Blu-ray players out there because each one of the PlayStation 3s is a Blu-ray player.
9302084	9305887	So they're counting those in the numbers, whether people use them as a Blu-ray player or not.
9307228	9307428	All right.
9307649	9308349	So there's your answer.
9309010	9309510	Short and sweet.
9310371	9310671	All right.
9311352	9312192	We're almost to the end.
9312412	9315475	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, Loki.
9316826	9317647	I'm out of root beer.
9318987	9319648	DarkSakura.
9328233	9330595	My final thought is thank you.
9330975	9332436	To those that care, thank you.
9332796	9333637	You keep it going.
9334217	9335098	You keep it awesome.
9336679	9339480	We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 237.
9341615	9345296	It's five years and one week anniversary next week.
9345576	9346416	We'll do it all again.
9346776	9350257	See ya.
