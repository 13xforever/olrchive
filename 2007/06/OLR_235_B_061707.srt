00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, the 17th of June, 2007.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Happy Father's Day again to those of you folks that are gamer daddies.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're going to get back into the gaming news.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Remember Orange Lounge Radio is released in two parts.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And if you haven't listened to part A, you missed a lot tonight.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So please go back to wherever you got this show and make sure you've tuned in to part A.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's continue on with tonight's program.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I'm going to start us off with some more gaming news in this segment.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We talked a lot about PlayStation 3 and a little bit about computer games.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Started to dip into Xbox a little bit in the last segment.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We didn't really mention the Wii a whole lot.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But I do want to talk about Madden 2008.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And we don't talk a whole lot about sports games on this program because everybody likes their different genres.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Some of them are role-playing games.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We don't play a lot of sports games.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But some of these interesting new features in Madden 2008 are worth mentioning.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I want to talk about the friend codes system and kind of one of the bummers about Madden 2008.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
IGN recently interviewed the associate producer of Madden 08, Damien Zur.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And he's talked about that the game is not actually going to be using the friend codes.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You know how you've been collecting the Wii friend codes so you can trade Miis across the internet and stuff like that?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Madden 08 is not going to use that.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Quote, Madden Wii doesn't support the Wii's friend system during online play.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is something we're still working on with Nintendo.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
For now, our online play uses your EA Nation persona to search and manage your EA Messenger account.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So now you're going to have to balance this whole other thing.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But what?

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What if this is something that they're going to support through all their EA games?

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Which is fine then if they're going to do that.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As long as it's not...

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I mean, you can call their friend code whatever you want.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you've got to enter one in for each game, who gives a shit?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I mean...

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I just kind of wish Nintendo would just wake up and say...

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Because they're saying that we're having problems with Nintendo.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why is Nintendo holding back on this stuff?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's obviously what's going on here.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Nintendo's done this with the DS.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They held back on so much of what the DS actually had in it.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They didn't launch DS online until a year and a half after the system was out.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And then there was also the whole microphone and the voice chatting is just now happening.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know if Nintendo likes to time release the features of their system to make it last longer or what the deal is.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But it's weird.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I thought it was more technical issues.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What's that? Explicit?

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I thought it was more technical issues.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know, but it just seems to me like you're not seeing any online games.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think it's because no one wants to do it.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think it's because Nintendo's kind of keeping some secrets down or something like that.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bandit in the chatroom says,

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Online play doesn't start until Nintendo says so and the next gen doesn't start until Sony says so.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
SSJ100Matt being very random in our chatroom.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
chat.orangelandradio.com

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Dear Nintendo, bring back the Game Boy printer.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, knowing Nintendo, maybe there will be something to attach it to later.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
To print out your Mii or something like that.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
RossdielUT brings up a good point.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
EA could easily just say,

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No Madden for the Wii unless you stop with the friend codes.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't know though.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wii is selling pretty good to an audience that may not necessarily have a 360.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So I think you still want to get Madden out to that audience somehow.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't know.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well Madden Wii is going to get some other funny features in there as well.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Including some mini games, Mii integration, and the ability to draw on the screen.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Unless you two can be just like John Madden and draw on the screen.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
With the brand new Wii Illustrator.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So that's kind of funny.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And of course like FIFA and some of the other games that are coming out.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You will be able to integrate your Mii in there.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There are going to have a whole set of mini games.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Kind of similar I'm guessing to Madden 07.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You know, just field training and what not.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, so you can sketch all over the board like it was real football and everything.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But the $64,000 question is, will you be able to write out boobs on the prompt on the little thing?

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think you can.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
How very un-Nintendo like.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's that explicit?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Then again, Nintendo is supposed to be releasing a child porn game for the DS.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What?

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No, no, no.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That is Namco.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Or SNK.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
SNK.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The only new game that they're putting out was that stupid touch the witches thing to

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
see if they're witches and you flick their boobs and shit.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What in the fuck are you talking about?

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Maybe you should read some more Kotaku or something.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's at least one story about this damn game.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Give me a break.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There's like 50,000 game blogs out there I'm trying to juggle.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's a Japanese game where you have to find witches.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And the only way to find witches are to poke and prod at them on their body.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And one of the witches happens to be a little boy.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wasn't there like a cat or something too?

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't know.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's just weird.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,660
But yes, at one point you do touch little boys in that game, so that's weird.

102
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,000
But there's a lot of touching of women and you flick their boobs and stuff.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm poking Jamie to see if she's a witch right now, actually.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,600
She's about ready to break her bottle.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I beard you.

106
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I beard you.

107
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Wow.

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Jamie does not like to be poked and declared a witch.

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
And Madden 08 will be online.

110
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
We found a witch.

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
May we burn her?

112
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Of course.

113
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Burn the witch.

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,800
They're going to have a two-on-two versus mode as well for the mini-games, so that's

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
kind of cool.

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,320
Madden 2008, featuring hot two-on-two action.

117
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,440
So I have some happy news, like none of us didn't see this coming.

118
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,680
The Wii and the DS are outselling their Sony counterparts with a vengeance.

119
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:10,960
There have been 338,000 units sold in May, which is more than both the 155,000 Xbox 360s

120
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
and 82,000 PS3s put together.

121
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,680
Isn't that cool?

122
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,160
Not if you're a Sony fanboy.

123
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
You're kind of mad at this right now.

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,900
I mean, again, I try to be as impartial as possible, but let me say this news does not

125
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,680
surprise me.

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,080
Well, the top-selling game right now is Pokemon Diamond, and it actually was followed by Mario

127
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,960
Party 8 and, dear God, why anyone would want the Spider-Man 3 game, because it wasn't all

128
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,160
that good, and Pokemon Pearl.

129
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,360
And Wii Play was on number five, so isn't that cool?

130
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Not really, because the game kind of blows.

131
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
So guess what?

132
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
What?

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,280
The same thing is happening in Japan, like any of us are surprised.

134
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,160
So dear Sony, bite our asses, not love me.

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,540
Someone's a little bitter over Sony right now.

136
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
What's up with this?

137
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,380
Why all of a sudden Sony angst?

138
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,320
You weren't swayed by anything you heard about the agency in Part A or-

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
No.

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Okay.

141
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Parappa?

142
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
No?

143
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Silent Hill 5?

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Parappa!

145
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,280
Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction is going to be awesome.

146
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,200
Well, one thing that apparently is not so awesome is Project Hammer, or Project H-A-M-M-E-R,

147
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
if you will.

148
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,120
You might remember that this game was being shown actually at last year's E3 when they

149
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,280
originally debuted the Wii.

150
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,320
In fact, they had it playable on some workstations.

151
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,080
However, some sources are reporting that Project Hammer has been canceled.

152
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,480
IGN was reporting it a little earlier this week.

153
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,520
The team has moved on supposedly to look at some more expanded audience projects, whatever

154
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,680
that is supposed to mean.

155
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,920
Hopefully it's something original no matter what it is, but there it is.

156
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,480
Nintendo, by the way, has not released an official statement, but some folks have kind

157
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,760
of seen this coming for a little while because Project Hammer went into this mysterious T-B-A

158
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,160
status on its website, and it has yet to move from that status.

159
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
So there you go.

160
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,920
It was supposed to be a very interesting plot where you had a hammer-wielding cyborg and

161
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,360
you're protecting the U.S. from killer robots.

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,160
However, as silly as it might sound, it looked like the game was actually supposed to be

163
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
kind of fun.

164
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,960
I watched some people play it at E3, and it definitely didn't look like anything else

165
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,200
on Nintendo's system, so it's kind of weird that they would just kind of up and up cancel

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,800
this game, but I guess if it sucked, good for them for pulling the plug on it before

167
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,520
they actually released it and got all the bad press, I guess.

168
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,920
I think you should have had MC Hammer do the voice for Project Hammer, because that would

169
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
have been so appropriate.

170
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,280
Yeah, well, you can't touch this game now.

171
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
It's been canceled, actually.

172
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,240
Hammer, don't let him hurt you.

173
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,400
Did either of you guys see this at E3 last year when we were all there?

174
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Yeah, I remember Project Hammer.

175
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
You remember that?

176
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
I think they still had it on the website, on Nintendo's website.

177
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Well, it's just a rumor.

178
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,360
It's not officially canceled, but all signs point to...

179
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
I don't know.

180
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,720
I know just working in the retail and distribution side, there's a lot of things that go canceled

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,280
for a while and come back.

182
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,760
It's just because they're not working on it right now, kind of shelving it for a while.

183
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,080
Maybe they'll just decide to release it as a downloadable title on Nintendo Live Arcade.

184
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Oh, wait.

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
They don't have that.

186
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,200
Okay, the game I was talking about earlier was Doki Doki Majo Shimpan, and there's a

187
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,280
perfect example of the things that you poke in the game.

188
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Pompoms?

189
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Yeah, pom-poms.

190
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Anyways.

191
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Interesting.

192
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
So...

193
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,480
Thank you, Loki, for bringing down the maturity level of this show to a whole new low.

194
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Appreciate it.

195
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
No problem.

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,920
Just real quick, some chat comments from chat room.

197
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,480
Rama says, Project Hammer was designed to show how much of a powerhouse the Wii is.

198
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,320
Did you see the graphics on it?

199
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Interesting.

200
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,420
Yeah, it didn't look that bad, considering that the Wii just simply isn't as powerful

201
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,400
as the other systems.

202
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,040
Well, there you go.

203
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:07,480
Another interesting game coming out to the DS is going to have these two little kind

204
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,080
of cute stylus drum things, I guess, for it, so you're going to be able to beat the screen

205
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,480
like a taiko drum.

206
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Aren't the styluses kind of already drumsticks?

207
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
I mean, how...

208
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,360
Yeah, but it's two of them now, so you have two of them that you can drum the screen with.

209
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,920
But your DS actually comes with two styluses.

210
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,960
They give you a spare in there, and yet you still lose these little bastards everywhere.

211
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Maybe if, yeah, maybe if you're like my wife and lost, you know, the stylus, you know.

212
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Whatever, who cares?

213
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,200
You get another, you get two free styluses with it.

214
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
That's awesome.

215
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,840
So you can play this game once, because that's what always happens with these type of games,

216
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,600
with the special peripherals and stuff.

217
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,560
Very rare, well, I guess that's not true, because DDR I've played to death, but some

218
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,000
of these other music games I play once and I'm done.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,440
If you're going to be buying this in Japan, have you know the styluses aren't free.

220
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,960
They actually drove the cost of the game up about a thousand more yen, so.

221
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Which is what?

222
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Ten more dollars?

223
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,980
Basically is what that translates to, about ten more dollars for two extra stylus things

224
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,680
that are drumsticks, but not...

225
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
You just figure.

226
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Yeah.

227
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
I know.

228
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
Why can't you just use your fingernails?

229
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Maybe that's not good for a screen.

230
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,040
Or why can't you just use one stylus?

231
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,320
Or why not just play a real drum?

232
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,240
No, just, actually Taiko no Tatachin is kind of fun.

233
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,880
Taiko Drum Master, whatever you want to call it.

234
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,800
I don't know, but it's fun when you actually have the big old drum on it.

235
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,120
But then again, just like Donkey Konga, I played it once and then I was kind of done

236
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
with it.

237
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
So, whatever.

238
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, you know, there is something that a bunch of us have played several times, I'm

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,100
sure, if we had any real video game taste, which those of us in this room do.

240
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:54,800
So wonderfully, it is now Europe's Virtual Console's 100th game, F-Zero X, which is like

241
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
freaking rad.

242
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,960
I remember playing a ton of F-Zero X.

243
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
You know what's funny?

244
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,600
F-Zero X is the one F-Zero game I didn't play.

245
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
What?

246
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I know.

247
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,320
I played the one on the Super Nintendo, definitely the GameCube one, which was so underrated.

248
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
F-Zero X was like hotness.

249
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,240
Well, maybe they'll release it here.

250
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,560
Maybe that's a good sign that it's coming here.

251
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,840
I can come to my house and play it on my Nintendo 64.

252
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,080
You're actually going to hook that shit up just so we can play F-Zero X?

253
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
If I can find it, I will.

254
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
All right, it's a date.

255
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,320
I'll hook it up on my Nintendo 64.

256
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, that's right, I threw mine away in a dumpster.

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,080
I still have my Nintendo 64 in a box somewhere.

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,320
I can't find my Dreamcast, though.

259
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,800
I have all the accessories for the Dreamcast.

260
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,080
I think I'm missing a box.

261
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,480
I also have a Dreamcast sitting in a box over there that's not being used.

262
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,160
I want to use it as a Nintendo emulator.

263
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,680
Play some Guardian Legend again.

264
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,920
But of course, maybe I don't need to be using my Dreamcast as an emulator much longer.

265
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,420
Not if I get one of these.

266
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,320
You may have read about this, but there is a new Power Pack compact flash system.

267
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,120
This is pretty rad because it looks just like an old-school Nintendo cartridge, but it's

268
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,240
red and it's see-through.

269
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,500
What it is, it's a flash cartridge.

270
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,480
What you can do, you can actually store multiple ROMs on a compact flash card and then actually

271
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,240
put them on this cartridge and play pirated old-school Nintendo games to your heart's

272
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
content.

273
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,960
And it will only cost you $135 if you get one of these things.

274
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
But that's not bad.

275
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,840
I mean, for some people, that's how much they're going to spend on virtual console games when

276
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
you add it all up.

277
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,840
But what I love about this is they actually gave it the very retro look here.

278
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,480
They actually kind of put a little...

279
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,560
It looks like an old-school Nintendo game, if you see a picture of the box.

280
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,640
And even with this little rip-off Nintendo seal of approval there.

281
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,680
Well, it better for $135!

282
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Shit!

283
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,840
Well, I mean, compact flash readers are not exactly cheap pieces of equipment and the

284
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
whole thing.

285
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,600
We were joking, myself and my wife were joking, because we saw another one of those iPhone

286
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,720
commercials that they have on TV.

287
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,360
This isn't just the internet for phone.

288
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,400
This isn't scaled down internet.

289
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
This is the real internet.

290
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm like, it better be the fucking real internet for $600!

291
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,960
And then she's like, you should say that about every feature on it.

292
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm like, yeah, it better fucking be for $600!

293
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,840
There's lots of people waiting for their iPhones.

294
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I know this.

295
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Well, shit!

296
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,760
It better be everything that they promise it will be because it's $600!

297
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:30,320
So apparently the AMA is debating on whether to recognize game addiction as a real addiction.

298
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,840
So yeah, they're going to be debating about it.

299
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,400
And looking at all the facts and sooner or later we will have something for someone to

300
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,620
talk about saying, hey, game addiction's real, see?

301
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,040
It's just like alcoholism.

302
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,820
It's a disease.

303
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,160
How exactly does one go about debating game addiction?

304
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,120
Fucking fine though.

305
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I don't know.

306
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
Exploring the possible dangers of excessive video game playing that's over two hours

307
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
a day.

308
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Would you like to have a debate?

309
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,580
Oops!

310
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:10,260
Would you like to have a debate about gaming addiction right now?

311
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,200
Okay, who would like to take the point there is no such thing as gaming addiction?

312
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,120
Would anyone like to take the anti-point, there is no such thing as gaming addiction?

313
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,600
Would anyone like to do that?

314
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,480
Okay, Jamie will take the anti-point, there is no such thing as gaming addiction.

315
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,980
Okay, who would like to take the pro-point, there is such thing as gaming addiction?

316
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,120
Fine.

317
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
You will?

318
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Alright, that'll be interesting.

319
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Alright, Loki will take the point that there is a such thing as gaming addiction.

320
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Okay, here we go.

321
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Loki, opening statement.

322
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Korea, World of Warcraft, dead babies.

323
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,120
Alright, that was a very nice opening statement, thank you.

324
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Dark Sakura, rebuttal to the opening statement.

325
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
Obsessive compulsive disorder.

326
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Where are you going with this, exactly?

327
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,120
These people don't have addiction to gaming, they're obsessive compulsive.

328
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,120
And gaming just happens to be the object of their disorder.

329
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Loki, rebuttal.

330
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Okay, well still though, that's technically game addiction, they're addicted to games.

331
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,120
I mean, with OCD or whatever, they're not like, you know, drinking tons of alcohol.

332
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,120
They're not, you know, gambling or anything like that.

333
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,120
Gambling is also obsessive compulsive.

334
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:31,120
True, these are all, okay, well, I can have lung cancer or I can have cancer but it doesn't mean it's necessarily lung cancer or not necessarily, you know, from smoking or something.

335
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Are you saying games give you cancer?

336
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Addiction, I think, requires ingestion of a particular substance that your body eventually becomes dependent upon.

337
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Having a physical thing that you are obsessively compulsive to participate in is not the same as a physical addiction.

338
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:57,120
It's just that by doing this task over and over again, your brain chemicals are saying, hey, I like this and I want to keep doing this.

339
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:09,120
As opposed to you actually having a physical addiction to a substance that your body is starting to need to maintain a particular level of normalcy, I guess.

340
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,120
So you're basically saying World of Warcraft is not an injectable substance.

341
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Right.

342
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Rebuttal.

343
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,120
How many weekends have you skipped going out with friends and stuff to play World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI?

344
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,120
You're pointing at me and like maybe one.

345
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Because he knows that I haven't done it.

346
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
When I was sad and fat.

347
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
If you're going to point at me or like, you know.

348
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,120
You're not sad anymore.

349
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,120
You just lost the debate, bitch, you insulted the ref.

350
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Loki is the winner, ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I leave it to the chat room to vote.

352
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Chat room vote.

353
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Remember, our opinions don't matter.

354
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,120
It's the chat room's vote.

355
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Loki, anything else you wish to add, in all seriousness?

356
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:59,120
No, seriously, you know, gaming addiction as something that needs to be treated or something, that's retarded.

357
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Fucking parents need to step in and just fucking say, stop playing your damn games.

358
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Or if you're older, just have your girlfriend say, stop playing your damn games.

359
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Which is what you have.

360
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,120
I put them on drugs for OCD.

361
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,120
That's how Loki curbed his gaming addiction, is he married a woman that will pull the plug on.

362
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,120
I still play two hours of games a day, if that, more than that.

363
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Okay, then what's my excuse?

364
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:31,120
I was a massive gamer, married my husband, and now at heart I don't really play that much anymore except for pinball.

365
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
He still plays more than I do.

366
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,120
I don't care, he's welcome to as long as he leaves me alone.

367
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Well, there's going to be another kiss with Jack Thompson about this.

368
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Eh, eh, eh, eh, no.

369
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
He who shall not be named.

370
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
Oh, explicit hasn't been here in a year.

371
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
He doesn't know about some of our banning topics.

372
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,120
We do not mention his name in these circles.

373
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,120
That's right, it's actually codenamed Lord Voldemort, is actually what we refer to him as on the show.

374
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
So whenever you hear Lord Voldemort, that's JT, okay?

375
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Alright, you got it.

376
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Oh, we got explicit.

377
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
It's okay, G4 was banned too, but somebody else brought it up earlier.

378
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Leave it to Loki to bring that up, so there you go.

379
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,120
There you go, GS191 sums it up.

380
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Well, there's your cure.

381
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Marriage cures gaming addiction.

382
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Examples, Loki and Dark Soccer.

383
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
No, it doesn't.

384
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
I still play.

385
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I was never addicted.

386
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Because there's no such thing as gaming addiction.

387
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm not addicted to games.

388
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
It's like this, okay?

389
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:34,120
My wife doesn't like the fact that I talk about games a lot because, well, I work in the games industry,

390
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:43,120
I play games, I do this show, so I'm talking about work, my outside stuff, what I'm doing,

391
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,120
and unfortunately that all comes back to games because it all has something to do with games, usually.

392
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
I talk about movies though, a lot about movies and Transformers.

393
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:59,120
But still though, it's just, I think people have addictive behavior,

394
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
but these people, if games weren't around, they'd be addicted to something else.

395
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,120
So whatever, just fucking be responsible people.

396
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
That's what people need to do.

397
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
All right.

398
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
It's all done.

399
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
The debate's over.

400
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Jamie already lost because she made fun of the ref.

401
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Rob, I do that all the time.

402
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
It's because I love you.

403
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

404
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Well, here's the segment I love most of all, and it's the one where we get to hear from our listeners,

405
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,120
and I'm sure we've collected quite a bit of mail over the past two weeks because we had no live show last week.

406
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,120
So we're going to open up the mailbag, and whenever you want to email us,

407
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,120
you can always send an email to mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.

408
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Dark Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first, wearing some latex gloves though,

409
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
so she doesn't get anthrax or anything,

410
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,120
and pull out some of her favorite emails to share with us here on the show.

411
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
We call it the OLR mailbag.

412
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Dark Sakura, who emailed us this week?

413
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,120
Some people, a bunch of people, and I'm not reading all these fucking emails, so I'll just start here.

414
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
This one comes from Ospher.

415
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Hey, it's Ospher again.

416
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
I swear I wasn't drunk, Ospher.

417
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Hey, shush.

418
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Since I lack a high-speed connection, I always have to go to a friend's house and wirelessly download your podcast to my PSP.

419
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
It's been a few weeks since I last listened to this show, so I downloaded all that I could up to the current podcast.

420
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
In an episode a few weeks ago, I found it hilarious that Rob called his mom.

421
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,120
We got to find out some things that we never knew about him, like how he dressed up as Courtney Love and lip synced.

422
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
Do we really have to bring that up again?

423
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Good lord, you guys should find a video and upload it to the site if you can.

424
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
We are not retelling the story for your benefit explicitly.

425
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Go download the podcast. There's still others.

426
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,120
One week there should be a Parents of OLR show where you all call your parents or bring them on the show.

427
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,120
I'm sure some more interesting things should be revealed about you guys.

428
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Anyway, thanks for reading.

429
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,120
If we got my mom out here, that would be great because I want to get my mom to California.

430
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
For me, it was kind of like a one-time joke.

431
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Sequels are never as good as the original.

432
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
It was kind of like a one-time joke.

433
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,120
That was the Mother's Day show, by the way, where that happened.

434
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
There you have it.

435
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
No, but that was good.

436
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:06,120
My mom did great on the show, considering she had no idea we were calling her live.

437
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
She did a great job, so I was very proud of her.

438
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
So the next email.

439
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
Dun, dun, dun.

440
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
If you're ready.

441
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
Hey, you noticed that person again, but this is great.

442
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,120
And now I give you ten random questions spurred from my void of boredom.

443
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
This is Ocifer again.

444
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
I still am not drunk, Ocifer, I swear.

445
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
One, freeze.

446
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
What are you all doing right now at this moment?

447
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
The fucking show?

448
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Yeah, we're doing a radio show.

449
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Actually, Loki is not doing a radio show.

450
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I can clearly see, plain as day, Loki is playing on some Transformers-related website

451
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
and not paying attention to the mailbag.

452
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Now, now, this is game-related.

453
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
This is the opening cinematic for Transformers the game.

454
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
So, huh.

455
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
And I'm paying attention.

456
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
I just got served.

457
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
Two.

458
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Okay, you can move now.

459
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,120
What is the drink that helps you get up and go?

460
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Coffee.

461
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Tea.

462
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Loki stacking Pepsi cans over there.

463
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Honestly, water.

464
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
Or coffee.

465
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
If I need caffeine, coffee.

466
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Otherwise, I drink a crap load of water.

467
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,120
But tonight, it's Malibu and root beer.

468
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Which isn't as bad of a combination as you might think.

469
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
How many questions?

470
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Wait, this is ten random questions you said?

471
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Alright, oh boy, it's only a three-hour show.

472
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Let's keep it moving.

473
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,120
What is the capital of Germany?

474
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Wiener schnitzel.

475
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Four.

476
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,120
What is your favorite song on either BeatMania 2DX or DDR?

477
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
No, the Germany question still bugging me.

478
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,120
It was the city that was separated for so long.

479
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Berlin.

480
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Berlin?

481
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Yes, it was Berlin.

482
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
I like Berlin, the band.

483
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
On the metro.

484
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,120
I like Wiener schnitzel, by the way.

485
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
That's it for the questions.

486
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Oh, that's it?

487
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
No more questions?

488
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I'm not going to read anymore.

489
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
Dear Orange Lounge Radio, there needs to be an Oregon Trail for the DS, dammit.

490
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I'd prefer it be based on Oregon Trail 2 engine, but considering the chances of it coming out,

491
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
I'd be happy anyways.

492
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
What are other things y'all wish for?

493
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Perhaps even more ActRaiser for Sky, if he insists.

494
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Also, though not related to gaming, there should be a Deadpool movie.

495
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
Yes!

496
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Unless they royally screw it up like X-Men 3, then I'd cry forever.

497
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
That's Tim Tsurugi.

498
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Sorry, I had to look up on Wikipedia what the capital of Germany was,

499
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,120
because I didn't want to look like a dumb shit anymore than I already do on the entire internet.

500
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
It is Berlin, by the way.

501
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,120
If they did a Deadpool movie, they'd have to get the guy that does his voice in the game,

502
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
because he was the cryptkeeper.

503
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Sorry, what was our emailer emailing us about?

504
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
I was too busy on Wikipedia.

505
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,120
What else would I like to see on DS that was old-school gaming?

506
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Besides the mandatory Guardian legend answer,

507
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,120
no, you know what, I don't want to see retro games on the DS.

508
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,120
I want to see retro games on consoles I can play on my TV, just like the old retro games.

509
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,120
Zero, there's nothing I want to see on DS that's retro.

510
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
MDK.

511
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
That's pretty old-school.

512
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
I think that would be fun, because I like me some MDK.

513
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Did they ever make a sequel to MDK?

514
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Yes, they did, unfortunately.

515
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Insanest is yelling in chat room,

516
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,120
Arcon, Arcon, Arcon, over and over again.

517
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,120
That was a pretty awesome game, I'll give you that.

518
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Or StarCon.

519
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
I say nothing.

520
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
Nothing.

521
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Let's see.

522
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,120
This one's too long, and I'm just going to end up posting it on the forums anyway.

523
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Okay.

524
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I also got an email from one of the people who emailed me in French.

525
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,120
It says, thank you for replying to my email.

526
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
I felt like such a star when you read my letter.

527
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
I'm not used to all this.

528
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,120
By the way, you guys are talking about Sony a whole lot.

529
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Thanks for making the effort, and I might have to go and pick up a Pokémon game or two.

530
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
You guys seem to really love them.

531
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
I have to be honest.

532
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,120
We didn't really change anything in the creation of the show.

533
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,120
It's just that, I guess, the weeks you were listening previous, there just was a lot of Xbox heavy news.

534
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,120
But right now, there's not a lot of, you know, there seems to be actually more Sony and PC news this week.

535
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
So, you know, it just depends on the flow of news.

536
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
What we cover.

537
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,120
By the way, that was Spamoflauge.

538
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
I love that name.

539
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
That's a pretty rad name.

540
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
And then I'm not going to read any more emails.

541
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
Are the emailers being punished?

542
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Alright, I'll read one.

543
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
One more. Alright.

544
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
From AZHP.

545
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Okay.

546
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,120
Hi guys, I was listening to your podcast on the way to class today,

547
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,120
and I noticed you guys talking about how Mario Party 8 backups don't work on the Wii.

548
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,120
As I am a college student and I back up my games so that I don't have to lug around DVD cases back and forth,

549
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,120
mentioning this so I don't get you guys in trouble for talking piracy.

550
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,120
In fact, I've also contributed to the design of a Wii mod chip for this purpose.

551
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Anyway, I can confirm that Mario Party 8 backups work fine.

552
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,120
As I backed up mine, and I'm playing it as I type this.

553
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Wow, you're talented.

554
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,120
What is likely the case of the misinformation on your last show is that the game does not work on PAL territory systems,

555
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,120
which is a relatively common problem due to the incompatible video issues.

556
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Just wanted to clear that up, and while we're on the topic,

557
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Nintendo has been cracking down on piracy in other ways, if not through software.

558
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,120
If you've gotten by a Wii now,

559
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,120
there's a chance that you'll get a Wii that inside has three pins on its DVD controller chip cut off.

560
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,120
These pins serve absolutely no purpose except to allow hackers like myself a backdoor into the system.

561
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
They're always talking about a backdoor.

562
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,120
I don't want to get into too much detail, but cutting the pins makes it extremely difficult to modify the console.

563
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,120
However, it's not going to stop anything other than casual modding

564
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,120
because you can find professional modders anywhere who will still take the job for 20 bucks.

565
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
That brings me to my question for you guys.

566
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Is it possible for a company to stop piracy in its tracks?

567
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Fuck no.

568
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
That was me, by the way.

569
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Do you think that the funds invested in stopping piracy is greater than the potential loss incurred from allowing it to run rampant?

570
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,120
I'm not asking if the monetary value of the pirated goods is significant.

571
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Obviously, it is.

572
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,120
However, most people who pirate wouldn't buy nearly the same amount of games as they are pirating.

573
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
So do you think it's a company's best interest to stop modding,

574
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,120
or do you think it's something that they do in order to appease uneducated shareholders?

575
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
That's a good question.

576
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
I think it is not in their interest, but I want to hear your two cents.

577
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Sorry for the long email.

578
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

579
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
AZHB.

580
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Okay.

581
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I think that that's part of it, too.

582
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:18,120
The average boardroom suit and tie person is only going to look at numbers.

583
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:25,120
They're only going to look at face value good idea because, remember, once you get into upper management, you turn into a moron.

584
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Wow, someone's jaded.

585
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
That's all right.

586
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I understand.

587
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I think that some of it is for, you know, face.

588
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Some of it is, I think, they want to discourage the casual pirate.

589
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Like, these people said, oh, I can just clip this on the back of my PlayStation, and I can play whatever, blah, blah, blah.

590
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,120
They want to discourage those people who don't know what the fuck they're doing.

591
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,120
For those of us who know what we're doing, there's not going to be any way that they can stop us if we try hard enough.

592
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
If we care enough.

593
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Here's my thing is that, with no disrespect to the emailer, you go to all this trouble to back up games because you don't want to haul DVD cases around.

594
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Am I really supposed to believe that?

595
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
I mean, I guess.

596
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I guess it's possible.

597
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:23,120
It seems to me like that's, it's not that I'm saying like, oh, you're a thief or whatever, I'm just like, that seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to.

598
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,120
Just to not have to carry around DVD cases, which aren't that big a deal.

599
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Better yet, if you're backing up a game, say, onto another DVD to play it on your system, aren't you still carrying around that DVD?

600
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,120
It's just now it's a backed up one instead of the real one?

601
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
I don't understand how that's cutting down on DVDs.

602
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Of course, our chat room is chiming in here at chat.orangelaundry.com.

603
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Black Wolf, our old buddy who just turned 100 today, said, we tried to stop them, but they always get by what we do.

604
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,120
It sounds better than, well, we won't do anything because they'll get around it anyway.

605
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,120
I guess that's a good point, kind of going back to the boardroom things going on in there.

606
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:14,120
NintendoManiac64 says, backing up DS and GBA games is very helpful, though, in regards to bulk and carrying things around and stuff like that.

607
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,120
So, there you go, some chat room feedback.

608
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,120
All right, any other emails?

609
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
No, well, there were, but I didn't read them.

610
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
All right, fair enough.

611
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:32,120
If you would like your emails to be judged by DarkSakura, she's judged the rest of the mailbag this week, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

612
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Back into some gaming news, let's talk about Halo 3, because I'm sure we're not going to be able to get from now until November and not bring up Halo 3 at least once.

613
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,120
This is just a really big game.

614
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:54,120
There are going to be some limited edition Halo 3 controllers and headsets coming out, and this is going to be coming out from GameStop.

615
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
At least GameStop is now listing them.

616
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Everyone's going to have them.

617
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,120
Everyone's going to have them, but GameStop has kind of spilled the beans on it.

618
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,120
This is $59.99 for the wireless controllers, because you're going to pay $10 more because they have pretty pictures on them.

619
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:13,120
One has the Spartan, one has the Covenant, and then there is also a green headset that's going to be coming out.

620
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I don't see the price for this one.

621
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Oh, it's also $59.99, the wireless headset.

622
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:25,120
All it really is, it's green, and the button is orange, and it has a teeny little Halo 3 logo on it, which seems like a real waste of money.

623
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Those are all designed by Todd McFarlane, and they also come with figurines.

624
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Yeah, but do they really? This doesn't say anything about this.

625
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
They do come with figurines.

626
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Oh, well that makes it a little more worth it. I don't see anything like that in here.

627
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Is that something unsaid?

628
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,120
No, the controllers come with figurines. In fact, they've had a picture of the Halo 3.

629
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,120
I don't know if Master Chief has come in with both of them, but one of them has Master Chief.

630
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Now, of course, even though these are limited edition, you know they're going to be everywhere when the game comes out, and they'll probably be trying to sell them when you buy the game.

631
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,120
You want to get a matching controller or a matching headset with your game? You want the strategy guide?

632
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,120
Because that's what they do. That's how they make their money.

633
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
They'll be limited, so, you know.

634
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,120
How limited, though? Come on.

635
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Pretty limited.

636
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
You think?

637
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
Eh, I think so.

638
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,120
I got a Halo Xbox, and I'm not even that big a Halo fan. I just bought it because that's when I finally decided to buy an Xbox.

639
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,120
And it probably came with a free game, didn't it?

640
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Halo, actually.

641
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
Yeah.

642
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
Hence the Halo Xbox.

643
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Anyways, I'm not a big fan of Halo, but I am a big fan of this game.

644
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Grand Theft Auto IV is going to be coming. They're getting a new trailer coming out on June 28th.

645
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Yes, once again teasing us with another game trailer.

646
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:46,120
This trailer is called Looking for That Someone Special, and it's going to be released on June 28th.

647
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:54,120
So if you're itching to get some more Grand Theft Auto footage, that's when you'll be able to find some.

648
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,120
So, awesome! I cannot wait.

649
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,120
You're really excited about this Grand Theft Auto, huh?

650
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
Fuck yeah.

651
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I'll check it out, but I don't get excited about trailers.

652
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,120
You're really that excited over a trailer?

653
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Yes, because it's just like the Transformers movie. I watch every bit of stuff I can on it.

654
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,120
Of course now I'm going to start slowing down because I don't want to spoil anything.

655
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,120
Although I've already spoiled too much.

656
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Fair enough, I suppose.

657
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Well, something that I guess people will care about is that track and field is going to be closer to release on Xbox Live Arcade,

658
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,120
probably in, quote, the next month or two.

659
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Yeah, it's track and field.

660
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Not one of the best old school Konami games that exist, but they've had some pretty good ones lately.

661
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Like, I like Time Pilot, Rush and Attack was kind of fun, but track and field was just like, you just would slam the-

662
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
It's making my thumbs hurt, the game.

663
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Yeah, it's like all those old school Mario Party games where you just hit the button over and over and over again.

664
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,120
That's all track and field was.

665
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,120
One auto-fire controller will fix that.

666
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Hell yeah.

667
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,120
That's why we had the turbo button on the turbo graphics. Hi.

668
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,120
I needed to find one of those easy achievement points. Hell yeah.

669
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Well, maybe there'll be something to kind of get around the auto-fire or something.

670
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,120
You'd think they'd put something into place, but we'll see I guess.

671
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Oh, they won't? Come on, these people are lazy when it comes to making these games.

672
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
They're just pouring it straight over.

673
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Maybe that'll be a title that comes out. Like, you know how some weeks they've been doing two games a week lately?

674
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,120
Maybe that'll be kind of the B-side for the week, will be track and field.

675
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Anyhow, Halo 2 and Shadowrun, of course, both recently came out in the new games for Windows collection.

676
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,120
That's Vista only, or is it?

677
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Falling Leaf Studios has actually gone to extents to make the games XP compatible.

678
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,120
What the company is saying is that if you buy the games from Amazon through their links,

679
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,120
because you know how Amazon has that referral program where you can get money back or whatever?

680
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Then what they will do, they will send you for free the initial release of this compatibility software that will let you run them on XP.

681
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Here's a quote from the CEO Brian Thomason that says,

682
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:30,120
First, Microsoft claimed that it was impossible to implement DirectX 10 compatibility atop Windows XP, and now they also want us to believe that they couldn't successfully launch two DirectX 9-based titles on XP either.

683
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,120
We plan to expose both theories as patently false.

684
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:40,120
But now they haven't really, you know, they haven't showed this to be true yet.

685
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,120
This software doesn't already exist.

686
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,120
Supposedly this is going to come out within a few months.

687
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,120
So we shall see if they can expose that to work.

688
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
I would laugh if it was a huge scam.

689
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,120
But is it a scam? I mean, you're still getting the game for the regular price.

690
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,120
It's just that, you know, they got a cut of it from Amazon, so I don't know.

691
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,120
We'll see. Anyways.

692
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,120
Bandit in chat is very adamant here. He says,

693
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,120
It's a fake. He's 19 and is lying. He makes 10% on that shiznit.

694
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,120
That's true. There's really nothing they can do about it.

695
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,120
Somebody complained to Amazon, maybe. I don't know.

696
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:21,120
Well, I guess our usual plug for GameTap.

697
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
But anyways, this is news.

698
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Brand new. They're a free service that they launched, I believe, last month.

699
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,120
They're actually now going to be expanding it, which was currently 30 games, to 40 games now.

700
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,120
So I guess they've got a few more people backing it.

701
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,120
And they've also, I guess, for the regular subscription service, they've added Psychonauts,

702
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:47,120
King of Fighters 97, Golden Axe the Duel, Art of Fighting 3, and Metal Slug 3.

703
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Dude, Golden Axe the Duel.

704
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,120
I think that's pretty awesome that Psychonauts is on it.

705
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Those are some pretty awesome games they put on there for free.

706
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Dude, I love Golden Axe.

707
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:01,120
I don't like the first Genesis one. It makes me miss the arcade.

708
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Golden Axe the Duel was actually one of the first Saturn games I ever played.

709
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
I keep forgetting games have a Saturn.

710
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,120
When I lived in Alabama, my friend wanted a Saturn so badly he imported it.

711
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
It was like the world's biggest Sega fanboy.

712
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
So he imported a Saturn.

713
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,120
So the first games I got to play was King of Fighters 95.

714
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
I learned the RAM cart switch.

715
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,120
And Golden Axe the Duel and some Gundam game that was okay.

716
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
Act deft, and our chat room is getting very excited.

717
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,120
King of Fighters 97 for free.

718
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,120
No, it's for paid accounts.

719
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Oh, only the paid accounts for King of Fighters 97?

720
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
Those are your games for the paid accounts.

721
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,120
Although it may cycle through into the free games.

722
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
You never know.

723
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,120
There's 40 games to choose from right now for free.

724
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Interesting.

725
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,120
That would suck though if you were getting really attached to a title and then they pulled

726
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
the plug on it.

727
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
But I guess that's how they make their money.

728
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,120
Dude, it's-

729
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
I mean, they're not in business to just give things away.

730
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,120
Exactly.

731
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120
I guess that's true.

732
00:37:53,120 --> 00:38:00,120
Well, one thing that I think our Second Life friends will enjoy, another thing to keep

733
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,120
you ingrained in unreality is that they are adding voice.

734
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:16,120
It's actually, from what I understand, it's at Warhead, one of the places in Second Life.

735
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,120
I don't play Second Life, so I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.

736
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Me neither.

737
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:28,120
You are greeted by dancing and flying sperm and gunfire.

738
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
That sounds like Second Life.

739
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
This is even better than the flying cocks.

740
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,120
That is something that they should turn into a TV show.

741
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,120
But apparently now that's not happening anymore because they have voice chat.

742
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:47,120
So people, you can download a special version of the client and in certain places, and one

743
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,120
of the places is Waterhead, you can hang out and just chat with people.

744
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Dude, you know what I can do?

745
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,120
I can pick up my phone and call people and chat with them if I wanted to fucking talk

746
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
to people.

747
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,120
I'm online for a reason.

748
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,120
Drewnami in chat says, it's about fucking time Second Life there has had voice for fucking

749
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
ever.

750
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Well, there is like a competing type of thing that has had voice chat for a while.

751
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I've heard of there before.

752
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,120
You remember DDR Angel when she's come on this program?

753
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
She was really into there.

754
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
It was that game she was really into.

755
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
So, huh.

756
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
Well, there you go.

757
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,120
I did find the Final Fantasy VII thing that they made in Second Life.

758
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,120
It was pretty cool.

759
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:34,120
I've always wanted to check out Second Life, but I always go back to World of Warcraft

760
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,120
because I have no First Life.

761
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,120
And I was like, oh my god, this sucks, and then deleted it.

762
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:44,120
I'm afraid that with Second Life, it would be like me and the Sims where no good can

763
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
come of this.

764
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,120
Can't you start a little OLR club or something?

765
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,120
I don't want to do that.

766
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,120
I guess there used to be a little all games room, but then somebody stopped paying rent

767
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
on it or whatever, so it got imploded.

768
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,120
Because I remember somebody sent us a picture of our little OLR logo somewhere in Second

769
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Life, and I was like, oh, that's kind of neat.

770
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
There you have it.

771
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,120
So much for Second Life.

772
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,120
While I was bored during my first life, I was surfing on Dig, and this story was dug,

773
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
which I thought was interesting.

774
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,120
It's from the website toold2play.com, and the topic is about, it says, childhood gaming,

775
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,120
what games would you like remade?

776
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,120
And it just basically goes on to say, hey, we remember these games from when we were

777
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,120
older, from the Nintendo Entertainment System to Genesis and 3DO.

778
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Apparently, this author remembers the 3DO.

779
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,120
I do not remember the 3DO.

780
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,120
However, this guy made a list of the top 15 games that he would like to see.

781
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,120
It's by Code Monkey is the guy's name who wrote this.

782
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
It's 15 games.

783
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,120
It goes all the way from Red Baron on the PC, Shadow Gate was number two, WWF Wrestling

784
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,120
the arcade game number three, River City Ransom number four, and number five was Maniac Mansion

785
00:40:54,120 --> 00:41:00,120
all the way down through Ikari Warriors, number 15 on the NES, just talking about how he would

786
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
like to see these kind of redesigned.

787
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Well, Maniac Mansion has a sequel.

788
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,120
I thought it did, but these games, all these series kind of died a long time ago.

789
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
I guess.

790
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,120
And he says he remembers Zelda, but he can't really say Zelda because Zelda's not really

791
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
dead.

792
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,120
I'm just kidding, but these series are all kind of dead.

793
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,120
Ross Steel UT in chat says Crystalis.

794
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
That's a good pick.

795
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,120
That was a good game.

796
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,120
I also like from this list 11 RC program.

797
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,120
You know I can't get through this segment without saying Guardian Legend.

798
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
It's a must.

799
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
What other old school game?

800
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
How about Star Tropics?

801
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,120
What the hell ever happened to Star Tropics?

802
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,120
I'm surprised I haven't made it to Virtual Console yet.

803
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,120
I'm surprised too, and I'm surprised that the, what was the kid's name in Star Tropics?

804
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,120
There is a perfect character for Smash Brothers at some point.

805
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
If I can remember, God, why can't I remember the kid's name?

806
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,120
The only bad thing though about that is going to be the fact that you have to dip that manual

807
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
in water.

808
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Was it Mikey?

809
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
I think it was Mikey or Mike or something.

810
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
Mikey I think was Goonies too.

811
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
He had a really generic name.

812
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Mikey was Goonies too, and it was Zeb or Zeke or something that was a bad guy.

813
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,120
There you go.

814
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Anyways, so we talked a little bit about MAME earlier.

815
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:22,120
Now, one of the boards for, actually the Capcom CPS3 arcade board has slightly been cracked.

816
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,120
They've gotten some of the code to run from the boards, and sooner or later they're going

817
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:31,120
to have the whole board emulated, and of course, that means that some games that you might

818
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:38,120
like will be able to be played, such as Jojo's Venture, Street Fighter III, and Red Earth.

819
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
I thought you said games I like would be playable.

820
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
Well, Street Fighter III is not bad.

821
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
It isn't.

822
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,120
It wasn't that bad.

823
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:51,120
It was no Street Fighter II or, I never really got into Street Fighter III.

824
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,120
Maybe I'm not giving you enough credit, but I didn't care for it.

825
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,120
I had my one moment of glory in Street Fighter III.

826
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
Yeah, I had a moment.

827
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Maybe not a moment of glory.

828
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
No, I played it a lot, but I had my moment of glory.

829
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Street Fighter III and I went out on a date, but we just didn't get along, and it wouldn't

830
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,120
put out, so I had to say goodbye.

831
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
There you have it.

832
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
But I guess that's cool.

833
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,120
For all you folks that like to pirate tons and tons of arcade games and play them on

834
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,120
MAME, that's great news for you guys, so congratulations.

835
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Well, here's an interesting thing that's being advertised for GameStop.com, is a Wii Blaster

836
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:39,120
available June 27th, like pew, pew, pew lasers, I guess, but it's on one of their flyers that

837
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,120
it will be available, like I said, on the 27th.

838
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,120
I guess to go out with...

839
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,120
What game's coming out on Wii that's going to require a gun, maybe?

840
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Well, there's Chicken Shoot.

841
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,120
Oh, yay!

842
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Chicken Shoot!

843
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,120
Hey, I guess you may be able to use it for maybe Resident Evil 4.

844
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:08,120
Well, later on, back when we get into the fall, Chronicles and Ghost Squad, I don't know.

845
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
But why do we need this yet?

846
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,120
Maybe Duck Hunt on Virtual Console.

847
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Duck Hunt!

848
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,120
Or better yet, this is just a piece of useless crap that they're trying to push on you.

849
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,120
Or how about this, better yet, why don't Nintendo do what Nintendo does best and hold out on

850
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:28,120
the good stuff, so instead of giving us Duck Hunt, why don't you give us Wild Gunman, which

851
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,120
if you've ever played Wild Gunman...

852
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Maybe we'll get Blastress.

853
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,120
There was seriously nothing to Wild Gunman.

854
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,120
It was who can pull the trigger faster when the thing says go.

855
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,120
They made an entire video game and sold this for a lot of money, an entire game out of

856
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,120
who can push the button first was the game.

857
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,120
So you'll probably see that on Virtual Console, and then you'll get such brilliant classics

858
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
like Hogan's Alley.

859
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,120
But then, and only then, will Nintendo finally deliver the Duck Hunt.

860
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,120
Well, what this basically does is just allows you to attach your remote and nunchuck to

861
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
one device to turn into a shotgun thing.

862
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,120
Although the Wii Blaster is not going to be the only device to come out, actually at the

863
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:16,120
same time, Joytech is going to be releasing the Wii Sharpshooter, not quite as orange

864
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,120
as the other one, but accomplishes the same thing.

865
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Basically puts your Wii nunchuck kind of in the pistol grip area and then the remote on

866
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
top.

867
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,120
To be honest, both of these are completely useless.

868
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,120
It's not the Wii kind of shotgun thing that you saw at E3.

869
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,120
This is something completely different.

870
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,120
It does not enhance your gameplay at all.

871
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Frisbee in Chad reminds us about something related to Wild Gunman.

872
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,120
Frisbee says, a Wild Gunman was good on WarioWare Game Boy Advance.

873
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,120
I totally forgot that it was in that game.

874
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,120
But yeah, there was many references to Wild Gunman in there.

875
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Interesting.

876
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,120
I don't know, is this a peripheral you're interested in getting, Jamie?

877
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,120
I know you like to collect everything related to games.

878
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
That's how I thought.

879
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,120
Me too.

880
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Me too.

881
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
Maybe if we get a point blank.

882
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,120
Seriously though, there was one- Point blank Wii might sell me on it.

883
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,120
I don't remember what it was called, but there is one peripheral out there that looks

884
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,120
like it might actually be some good.

885
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,120
It was a thing that looked kind of like a pistol and you actually put your remote into

886
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,120
the pistol and the trigger on the pistol would hit the B button.

887
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,120
So that does change it a little bit and then that way the nunchuck's just kind of independent

888
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
from that and you just hold that in your other hand.

889
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,120
So that's more of something that you would probably be looking for.

890
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,120
This thing is just attaching the remote and nunchuck together, which will probably allow

891
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,120
you not to play certain games if you were to actually do that.

892
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,120
So it's a waste of money.

893
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,120
It's just like those fucking sports attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.

894
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,120
Have you ever seen the attachments, and I see the surprise all the time, that look like

895
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,120
a tennis racket and a baseball bat?

896
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Exactly what I was talking about.

897
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,120
Boy, does that stuff look crappy.

898
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,120
Seriously, somebody is selling shaped plastic for lots of money.

899
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,120
Yeah, because people are dumb and will buy it.

900
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Yeah, exactly.

901
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,120
I was like, dude, remember the consumer market?

902
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,120
Stupid.

903
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,120
Make stuff stupid people will want.

904
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:09,120
Maybe having one of these plastic things shaped like a tennis racket will help you win the

905
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,120
first organized Wii tennis tournament that any of us know of.

906
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,120
It's called Wimbledon.

907
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,120
Get it?

908
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Instead of Wimbledon.

909
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,120
Wimbledon.

910
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,120
It's being held June 23rd at Barcade, which is in Brooklyn.

911
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,120
I was just there.

912
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,120
It's pretty awesome.

913
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,120
Barcade is pretty cool.

914
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:29,120
I should have gone to Barcade.

915
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
I knew of that place.

916
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,120
I knew it was in Brooklyn.

917
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,120
I was fucking in Brooklyn just a week ago.

918
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,120
I didn't even think to go to this place.

919
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
Oh well.

920
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,120
Here's a quote from the official site for Wimbledon.

921
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Wimbledon is a Wii tennis tournament being held on June 23rd, that's next Saturday,

922
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,120
from noon until 5 p.m. at Barcade in Brooklyn, specifically Williamsburg.

923
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,120
There will be singles and doubles tournaments, prizes and beer, maybe even some strawberries

924
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
and cream.

925
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Oh, and cucumber sandwiches.

926
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
Okay.

927
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,120
I guess that's a joke about Wimbledon that I don't get.

928
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,120
I don't know.

929
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,120
Okay.

930
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,120
I don't watch tennis on TV or anything, but I like Wii tennis.

931
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,120
It's kind of fun.

932
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Yeah.

933
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,120
I know it's not real tennis, but there you go.

934
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,120
I was just thinking those plastic attachments for the Wii and stuff.

935
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,120
You know people have trouble as it is holding onto the Wiimote.

936
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,120
Can you imagine that with the chunk of plastic flying towards your TV?

937
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,120
Talk about some serious damage right there.

938
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,120
Wow.

939
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,120
Anywho.

940
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,120
So yeah, you want to get scared?

941
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,120
Well, here's your chance.

942
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,120
WifeSwap is looking for gamers to be on their show.

943
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Wait, like the TV show?

944
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
Yes, like the TV show.

945
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,120
Wasn't that the one that had my favorite lady ever?

946
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,120
Yes, the God Warrior.

947
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
I fucking love her.

948
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,120
She's the best thing ever.

949
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:56,120
So yeah, so apparently you can possibly, if you're picked, you and another family will

950
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,120
swap wives and have the chance to earn $20,000.

951
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,120
I'm guessing you're going to get someone that hates video games coming to your family

952
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
if you're a gamer.

953
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,120
Oh my God, Nellie would be perfect for this program.

954
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,120
Yeah, but we don't have a kid.

955
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,120
They said two parents and at least one child, six or older.

956
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,120
So unless we can adopt someone really quick, I don't think that's going to happen.

957
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,120
Can you imagine if Jamie went on this program?

958
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,120
I want no money.

959
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
I want nothing.

960
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,120
I want my God and I want my family.

961
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,120
She's tampering and doubts that it's stuff.

962
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,120
She's not a Christian.

963
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,120
Yes, you could have that in your house, Jamie.

964
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,120
Wouldn't that be exciting?

965
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,120
I'll kill whoever.

966
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:50,120
I'll kill them to death with a spork.

967
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:55,120
Rama in chat says, you know, if Dark Sakura had a kid, this would be perfect.

968
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,120
I think Loki would be a good candidate for this show too.

969
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,120
I don't plan on breeding.

970
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Anyways, I thought you were going to have a kid named Error.

971
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
No.

972
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:12,120
If you are interested and you qualify, you know, have a child that's six years or older,

973
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:19,120
if you're interested, you want to email jodyfriedman at rdfusa.com.

974
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,120
You know, just send her a letter to say hello.

975
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,120
Why don't you send her an email and say, hi, what's up, babe?

976
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:31,120
Or just go to abc.go.com slash primetime slash wife swap.

977
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:35,120
I hope one of our listeners gets to do this, that would be far too exciting.

978
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,120
You should borrow a kid.

979
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
I wish I could.

980
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,120
Rama says that was actually trading spouses.

981
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,120
The Fox version of the show was the God Warrior lady.

982
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,120
The clip that I played was trading spouses.

983
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,120
Wife Swap is the ABC version of the same fucking show.

984
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,120
Yeah.

985
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,120
Okay.

986
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,120
Kind of like Super Nanny and Nanny 911.

987
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Same fucking show, two different networks.

988
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,120
You should rent a child.

989
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,120
Yeah, you could borrow a child for like two weeks.

990
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,120
I might see if a coworker has one you can borrow.

991
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,120
No.

992
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,120
Besides, I'd get some crazy bitch in my house throwing my shit away.

993
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,120
I don't need anyone to be doing that shit.

994
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,120
Or actually, no, that's right, I would be there.

995
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,120
So I would be able to monitor where she throws shit away.

996
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,120
No more playing games.

997
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:29,120
Fine, I can do that, you stupid whore.

998
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,120
And you know they're going to get some World of Warcraft addict on the show.

999
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,120
And you get some smart ass kid that obviously it's not your kid or whatever.

1000
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,120
Yeah, that's my eight-year-old child.

1001
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,120
They're going to get some fucking World of Warcraft addict who's going to start twitching

1002
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,120
the minute they're missing a Tuesday night raid.

1003
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,120
They're going to start going into, like, and they're going to put him in like an Amish

1004
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,120
house and he's going to go, oh, actually no, wait, it's Wife Swap, huh?

1005
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,120
They're not going to put him, yeah, he's just going to stay there.

1006
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,120
They should get a wife that's more addicted than him.

1007
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,440
Yeah, they should get it well or whatever never mind. I guess it's not husband swap

1008
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,200
I'm just gonna shut up and let the callers do the

1009
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,800
Doing now if you want to be funny if you want to yeah

1010
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,640
Please be more funny than I am if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAMEOLR

1011
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,040
Let you sleep with the new wife unless she's ugly in which case you wouldn't want to touch that shit

1012
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,400
You're horrible

1013
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:21,280
1-877-GAMEOLR let's go to the phones or orange launch radio on Skype. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1014
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,040
Luke it's a Nintendo maniac 64. Hello Nintendo. Hi 64. What's on your mind?

1015
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:33,720
Oh right now I just gotta ask one little random question

1016
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:41,040
Do you know of anyone who actually doesn't use Windows XP or Vista other than like Mac and Linux and stuff?

1017
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:49,920
Like who uses something older if you will use any I mean like someone like me who's like a diehard Windows 2k addict

1018
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,600
I like fanboy. Yes. I know people who use a

1019
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,760
Palm OS

1020
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,360
I know people who still are on Windows 98

1021
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:05,960
Because they just don't feel like upgrading because all they use is the internet like my people who are still on Windows 3.11

1022
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:12,640
My my dad uses Windows ME, and I have no idea why but he does I know I'm compare downstairs

1023
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,520
It still works with 3.11. That's PC. I'm on right now is 98. How do you out of curiosity? Why do you ask?

1024
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,240
Yeah, I was just wondering since I don't know I never like people say like on the internet

1025
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,280
how like Vista was fucking like stick with XP. I always commented and saying like

1026
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:38,240
2k woohoo, let's bloat. I had to have my computer replaced because my husband decided he was gonna be nice and upgrade my

1027
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,280
computer from

1028
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Windows 2000 to

1029
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,920
Um XP and my computer upgrading I

1030
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,320
Like I said he thought that he was upgrading and it turned out that it completely fucked over my system

1031
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:58,080
I ended up having to have it anyway because I bought a vio now my vio is starting to die

1032
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,040
And I'm just so sad about the day that I would have to get a new computer with Vista on it

1033
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:08,560
Well, I have to ask another question. Okay. Well, it was in the first part of maybe was like wait second

1034
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,640
I mean when you guys like start talking like it was something like there was a bunch of anime coming to something and then look you

1035
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,400
Started going raving about how awesome Akira was. Okay. Well, what's the anime for?

1036
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,360
Like is it coming to something Xbox Live Arcade their movies?

1037
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:29,800
Oh Xbox Live Mark video marketplace like well same fucking thing. We the Xbox Live. I don't 360

1038
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:35,480
Yeah, it's actually already there right now. So okay and third off. Okay. I gotta have a mini rant

1039
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,280
All right, make it quick distance ball, man. I played it at friend's house

1040
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,940
They had cut the custom controls. It's like

1041
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,480
Half you can't map the weapon cycle to X or O

1042
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,040
what the crap and you can't map it so that you can have turning and

1043
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,320
Moving forward and back on the same analog stick since I grew up in Goldeneye and stuff

1044
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,440
That was the folk control scene and it's drilled in my head. I gotta do that and

1045
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,960
It won't even let me change the individual axes

1046
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:12,460
But what the heck boo in general the games that don't let you change the button configuration or whatever you like no matter what it

1047
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:16,080
Is well, the thing is it did let me change the buttons themselves

1048
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,380
Except that it wouldn't let me put weapon cycle on to X or O

1049
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:27,240
That's strange ones all over the place. I haven't played resistance. You guys have played it more than I have

1050
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,840
Is there's only one button for weapon cycle and it's I think because?

1051
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,520
Well, all the buttons are analog I guess but for whatever reason

1052
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:41,080
I don't know the it's the r2 button is the one you do for weapon cycle you tap it

1053
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,720
Then I'll switch to the next one or you hold it down and it'll allow you to switch which one you want

1054
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:50,060
I don't know. I love the it seemed pretty straightforward to me. I just kept it on the default stuff

1055
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,220
So I like them actually Oh kind of like we're it'd be like on the a button like the GameCube in 64

1056
00:55:55,220 --> 00:56:01,900
Like going after example, where's the next one? Just keep hitting a it's like eventually find whatever weapon you're looking for

1057
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,760
I suppose it's similar to like when I go when it well a couple years ago when I would go back and forth between

1058
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,060
fantasy star and Final Fantasy 11

1059
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,540
They had the camera on completely different

1060
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,820
Axises so that like when I went up and down and stuff

1061
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,720
He would like totally mess with my head because it was all messed up there

1062
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,820
All right. Well Nintendo mini x64

1063
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:26,560
Thanks so much for the call and hope you can get used to the controls in the game the way they are

1064
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:32,060
Yeah, well, I don't the ps3 so that's perfectly fine. Well more incentive for me not to get one

1065
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,060
You got it. So never mind then have fun

1066
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,380
Three Sony back by

1067
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,700
All right, if you would like to give us a call, it's a

1068
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:48,540
Orange lounge radio on skype or one eight seven seven game. Oh LR more phone calls. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

1069
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:54,700
Ravens dolphin. Well, hello Ravens dolphin. What's on your mind my friend? Why do you sound analog?

1070
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,820
I hate Skype 2.5. You sound like you're on like an old-fashioned phone

1071
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:03,500
I'm sorry you you kind of sound a little weird too, but whatever. We'll just have to deal what's on your mind

1072
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:09,100
It's the 2.5 thing. I'm sorry. It's all right. At least you're not breaking up or whatever. What's on your mind?

1073
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:16,660
Yeah, it's much clearer, but that sucks. Oh, sorry for going on that little rant Mortal Kombat for we I was so tempted to buy

1074
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,660
This the other day, but I didn't what about it. I

1075
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,580
Played it and I got to tell you something. It's a good Mortal Kombat game

1076
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:28,200
I was actually surprised that they did the wiimote thing very well

1077
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:35,500
Is it easy to control because that's the thing that holds me back. Oh, yeah. Oh hell yeah, really super easy

1078
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,300
It is a little one here. How easy yeah

1079
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,860
B you press on the B button and you like move it like a half moon up and down

1080
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:49,740
left and right and you do like the scorpion get over here real easy you get to do and

1081
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:56,940
Fatalities are just super easy. You know what I do with set fatalities. You just hold the button and swing it all around see what happens

1082
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:59,460
Something like that you swing it

1083
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,380
I could kind of like you're you have you have your you swing it and then you press the little

1084
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,780
Directional pad and it will do a fatality. That's how easy it is

1085
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,460
That sounds pretty funny, how do you move the guy around the screen you just use the control pad on the wiimote

1086
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,580
Yeah, you just use the little nunchuck and it just moves around

1087
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,900
Durr you have the nunchuck. I may say I guess I will check it out at some point

1088
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,280
I'm just a little bummed. It doesn't have online play because Nintendo is holding out for whatever reason so

1089
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,860
jerks

1090
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,980
Can I just rant about the new Skype on?

1091
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:33,460
the new Skype

1092
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:40,320
Yeah, 2.5. It has this really annoying ring thing and it gets in your ear. It's like this is Rob ring this sucks

1093
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:47,520
Yeah, that's just my voice that you're hearing that has nothing to do with Skype back to games back to games one more thing

1094
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,960
Yes, one more thing. You got a black DS. I sure did a black DS light

1095
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,520
I was so close to getting the pink one, but then I decided that next time I go to New York

1096
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:03,040
Hopefully the engraving machine will be working and I can get an engraved and engraving show up much better on the black DS than

1097
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,320
It does on any of the other colors

1098
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,320
So I in the end I went for the black DS

1099
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:12,540
What I do want to get though is I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get the little pink case with the sparkling little bling on it

1100
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,540
that's what I'm gonna get to have my

1101
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,760
princess peach homage

1102
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,520
I'm so happy for you. I got a black one too, and I love it

1103
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,400
Yes, and I actually hear the black ones are usually bigger

1104
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,240
So I hear yeah, all right, but that's just a rumor all right

1105
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:35,560
Anything else you anything else you want to add Raven Sullivan don't download 2.5. It sucks all right

1106
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,060
I won't I'll hold out on the current Skype. I have see you later, Raven Sullivan. Bye

1107
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,960
If you'd like to give us a call the username is the orange launch radio on Skype or one eight seven seven game. Ol are

1108
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,020
Hello you're on orange launch radio, who's this

1109
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,520
It sounds like do you like put this on auto dial or something and then when we finally pick up you like jump for

1110
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
The microphone like oh shit

1111
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:08,840
Don't you I just I just use brute force. I just say you know hammer the line guilty of that. Yeah, that's all right

1112
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,600
What's on your mind? It was good to see you this weekend Zaku by the way. Thanks for coming out

1113
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:16,220
Yeah, you missed our trip. You missed our trip to Astor place in the video game store

1114
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,880
That's what we did after I know I had to play distorted. You know oh, yeah, just came out then I

1115
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,000
Had him out there. It's all good buddy. What's on your mind?

1116
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Let me see you already know that

1117
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,760
Rock star is basically you know shifting more on to the Microsoft side now that they confirmed exclusive stuff for granted title for

1118
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,760
Basically dispelling all this you know any chances of it showing up on the ps3 at all

1119
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:47,400
Yeah, I've heard right and they and they had the Gulf to say that the ps3 version would move consoles

1120
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:54,800
Which is just a load of it's a load of bullshit because if there's nothing beyond the regular game that the ps3 folks could

1121
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,120
Okay, you know can can attain then what's the point of actually playing it?

1122
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,280
Well actually was it this is granted thought of for

1123
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,240
Yeah, rock star confirmed it in there in the shareholders meeting it will move consoles because well

1124
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,440
Oh wait, they don't have the episodic content either. Yes there we go

1125
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,760
That's exactly and Microsoft paid a good 50 million dollars to keep it on their side

1126
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,060
I think I'll just move consoles both for 360 and ps3

1127
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:24,320
How could you how could you move consoles when one side doesn't have anything beyond the gameplay?

1128
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,000
That's what that's what that's what I'm trying to get across to you

1129
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,600
We have the 360 which has the ability to go beyond the regular game

1130
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,040
You know in terms of multiplayer and exclusive content and the ps3 can't even do that yet

1131
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:43,160
So you will you weigh both of them and you see the 360 has more value

1132
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:50,740
Than the than the ps3 for the same price or maybe we should just take this literally and this is gonna reveal a brand new

1133
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:57,220
Console rumble feature, you know, that'll actually rumble the console when the games played, you know, well, that's that

1134
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:03,500
As yet to be seen but the bottom line is this rock stars basically leaning towards the side of you know

1135
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:09,720
It's basically the carrot in the stick the carrot, you know the stick being Microsoft the carrot being the money

1136
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,860
So you have to they're looking at the numbers right now, and they're trying to get to you know

1137
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:20,740
What's this about a stick and a carrot? I've seen the 360 is something that you know, they'll make a lot more money than

1138
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,580
The ps3 they just you know, I guess that's how the way it goes. I

1139
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,640
Guess so, I guess that's the way it goes. I just heard stick and a carrot

1140
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:35,060
Well, yeah, because you know Microsoft being the you know

1141
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:41,220
Microsoft being the the stick and then the carrot being the money. Hey dark Sakura

1142
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,600
What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?

1143
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,460
My ass

1144
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,860
All right

1145
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,300
What?

1146
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:56,380
Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference. I haven't seen you are a loser. All right. Sorry Zaku. I'm sorry

1147
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,620
I couldn't keep everybody on topic. But mm-hmm granted. I just I'm yeah

1148
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:03,900
I don't want to debate the Sony Microsoft thing anymore, you know

1149
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,540
You have to look at but you have to look at the writing on the wall

1150
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:12,540
The rock stars basically is gonna start you're just gonna have to start leaning towards one one side over another

1151
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,020
Regardless of you know, regardless of what's already been done in the past

1152
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:21,900
It's and by extending the game beyond beyond the disc Zaku

1153
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,300
It's just a crazy cycle

1154
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,540
The companies are gonna release the game on the console that has the most

1155
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,540
Number of machines in the market but the company's console that's gonna have the most number of machines in the market

1156
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,320
It's gonna be the one that has the good games on it. So it all comes down to first-party games

1157
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,540
It all comes down to the first-party games

1158
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:44,460
Exactly. Rockstar knows that 360 has a bigger install base in the ps3

1159
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,620
that it granted that the the 360 had a one-year head start and

1160
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:52,060
You know, they didn't they didn't blow they didn't take it for granted

1161
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,500
So yeah, this is good. You know, it's just that they're saying, you know

1162
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:02,860
Rockstar is just bullshitting when they're saying that their version their ps3 version of GTA 4 is actually going to move consoles

1163
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:09,740
We shall see what happens. It's just it it doesn't make sense. All right. Well, thank you very much for the call Zaku

1164
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,340
We gotta get some more calls. Mm-hmm. Bye. Bye. All right

1165
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:16,560
Orange launch radio on Skype one eight seven seven game

1166
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:23,060
Olr some comments from chat room GS 191 says shit at the end of the day take to interactive is gonna make a shit ton

1167
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,620
Of money anyway, you know to buy their stock before grand theft auto for release

1168
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:30,900
I hope the game tanks just to piss you all off. I don't care of it tanks

1169
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:36,580
I don't give a shit about their stocks. It's gonna be awesome. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hello. This is dr. Nah

1170
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,780
Hi, dr. Nah, what's on your mind?

1171
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:45,460
I just wanted to prove to all the other guys listening that you can actually get a call in if you try hard enough

1172
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,700
That's right. You just gotta hammering the line and you can get in. Well, I'm glad I'm glad you got it

1173
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,700
You have you called her show before?

1174
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,220
No

1175
01:04:53,220 --> 01:05:00,260
Never. Well, I just thought this is my second show listening live from Mexico City. Oh, well, welcome

1176
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:05,260
We like the world listeners. That's always fun house house house things going in Mexico City

1177
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,780
How's the gaming scene in a place like Mexico City?

1178
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:13,940
well, it's pretty much like Southern California which where I've been a ton of times and

1179
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:21,500
Pretty much. All you have to do is get a lot of games and there's really not that many people playing live

1180
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,660
I'd have to play with a bunch of guys from the u.s. So

1181
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,300
That's why I'm here

1182
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,340
There you go. Well, hey you meet a lot of a lot of folks here like to play with folks around the world

1183
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:35,540
It's good times. What what type of games have you been playing recently? Oh

1184
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:43,660
Sadly not the kind of game that I like. I like role-playing games, but there's not that many more out there

1185
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:49,820
So right now I'm pretty much playing shoot-em-ups. So the shadow runs in my latest failure

1186
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:55,100
You like me must be more excited about eternal Sonata than Halo 3

1187
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,660
Very much. So yeah, exactly right. What else did you want to comment on tonight, buddy?

1188
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:07,300
Well, just letting all the other listeners know for life that I just would not trade my spouse on any

1189
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:10,220
on any TV show

1190
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,900
Are you actually married I

1191
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,540
Married, I have a couple of kids. So it's a pretty interesting gaming scene

1192
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,300
Well, I fortunately I don't think you could apply for the show because the whole you know

1193
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,260
You're in another country and I think that that brings a whole nother issue into it

1194
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:26,260
But you're saying you wouldn't trade your right wife for anything

1195
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,060
No, and

1196
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,260
That's already given since

1197
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:38,020
Both my kids are starting into video games and there are only three and five. So what kind of games are you letting the kids play?

1198
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:42,140
Mostly we I got him a we and I have a bunch of games

1199
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:48,220
For kids basically anything rated E. I have Shrek I have

1200
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:54,700
Monster Saint that kind of games, you know, um, there was this guy I ran into at Fry's the other day

1201
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:59,620
And he was looking he was looking at the Wii games and he overheard myself and I think Shane talking to each other

1202
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,420
About the different games and he could tell that we kind of you know knew stuff about games

1203
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:08,300
So he actually came up and asked me he's like what would be a good Wii game for me to get for the family

1204
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:12,660
I'm like, well who's playing the Wii you or the kids and he said kind of something for all of us

1205
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,860
So I recommended Ella bits and worry aware. Was that a good suggestion? I don't know

1206
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,660
I couldn't think because at first I said well Zelda's the best game on the Wii

1207
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:26,260
But I don't know if young kids would really get into that so much. So I said Ella bits and worry aware

1208
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:28,820
Warrior where is good?

1209
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,820
Excite truck. Yeah

1210
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,740
Yeah

1211
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:38,340
By cities, that's your suggestion right Loki. I don't know what they don't have by city on the Wii

1212
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,700
It's our face Godfather

1213
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:46,700
No, Scarfy no trauma center get them started on the path to surgery early

1214
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,380
I said trauma centers a really fun game, but I don't think kids

1215
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,620
I like I just like watching the patients bleed because I'm no good at it

1216
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:58,180
But you know, it's funny. You said you wouldn't trade your wife for anything. I wouldn't inflict my husband on anyone else

1217
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:04,780
That's nice, there you go. Well, dr. Nard thanks so much for calling in

1218
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:09,220
We appreciate hearing from you and I don't know if they celebrated in Mexico, but Happy Father's Day. Nonetheless

1219
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,460
Thank you. That's it. All right

1220
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:17,100
All right. See you later. Take care. Thanks for calling. Bye. Bye. Bye

1221
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,300
JV Mon's yelling at me in chat 1 8 7 7 game. Oh LR

1222
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,340
We have time for a couple more calls JV Mon's yelling at me in chat saying

1223
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,460
awesome in JV, huh

1224
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:36,500
Zelda is so not the best game on the Wii. Zelda was so boring boring ass gameplay and JV Mon says sky

1225
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:41,020
I'm always yelling at you, which is true, but he bought me dinner in New York. So all is forgiven

1226
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,580
If you go meet the listeners, they'll buy you things. It's awesome

1227
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,380
I don't think they can spend that much money

1228
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,580
No, I can't what do I do I look like I'm made of money you make more than I do

1229
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:58,520
I can bear whatever I can barely afford my own plenty. I've debt make your make your work pay for me to go

1230
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:04,100
Sure, I'll do that. I'll do just that. Let's go to the phones and take at least one more call here

1231
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:10,220
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this? Hey guys, it's insane. Hello

1232
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:15,300
I'm going insane. Just be thinking about you. What's on your mind, buddy?

1233
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:24,620
Nothing you may all notice that I found a lot like and then when I'm not DMN, okay, so the very output

1234
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,700
Jamie took a ps3 and wasn't him to death. It was a horrible funeral

1235
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:38,220
So you have officially retired or killed off DMN and now we have insane us. That's dead. Okay. Yes, I have I

1236
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:43,180
That's your prerogative. You know Madonna wants everybody to call her Esther

1237
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,400
You have every right and Prince wanted everybody to call him. I'd symbols

1238
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,460
In Prince's a defense

1239
01:09:53,460 --> 01:10:00,820
And it was had to do with the fact that his previous label owned the name Prince so use the symbol in terms of protest

1240
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:05,580
Until the contract goes up and could get his thing again. Has this show really come to discussing Prince?

1241
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,780
That's a new album

1242
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:16,100
Crocheted assless pants and that's bravery. This is what it sounds like when I cry anyways

1243
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,420
Rob you need to explain something to your listeners, okay?

1244
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:25,860
That you're not doing orange on his radio anymore. I'm looking at this press release from CBS right here

1245
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,340
And apparently you're the new host of the price is right. I

1246
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:38,300
Freaking wish but unfortunately, I was here. No, no, let me let me let me read let me read this

1247
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,820
according to two years of

1248
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:48,220
Auditions tryouts and everything we have selected Rob Roberts as to be the new host of the price is right

1249
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:52,980
His audition tape said it all he showed so much emotion when doing his tapes audition

1250
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:58,260
In fact half of the five-minute tape was him crying because he was so nervous of doing this

1251
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:05,100
we think that this emotion will show will show perfectly or the new host of the price is right and

1252
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:13,700
We will have somebody more feminine than marker duties, I I don't know what to say insanest but

1253
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:18,700
A Plinko just moves me to tears. I'm

1254
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:26,740
Actually calling to raise some beef over the Church of England versus Sony

1255
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,660
Sorry, I'm just a little bit of a price is right

1256
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,860
bastard religion

1257
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:37,020
Wait, let's get into the music you listen

1258
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,020
See

1259
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:48,500
I wanted to turn the price is right into a gay rave. That's why I was not allowed to host it sadly

1260
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,940
I thought you just wanted you just wanted the sparkling jackets

1261
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:56,620
Dude rod Roddy was the man don't make fun of rod ready

1262
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:03,300
Anyway, sorry about that. I was actually gonna call the CBS executive. I'm just too fucking tired

1263
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,300
But

1264
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,500
I am up in arms over the Sony versus Church of England thing and how Sony is taking

1265
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,980
whole thing

1266
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:20,140
Initially, they weren't taking it seriously at all. They're saying oh, we're talking to the Church of England and Church of England was like, um, no

1267
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:29,460
No one's talking I think the Church of England's demands are a little bit harsh they want resistance fall man to be

1268
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:36,260
Completely removed from the shelves and for them to completely redesign the level that the Church of Manchester then. Mm-hmm

1269
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,820
I don't agree with that

1270
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:42,940
As much as I would love Sony to burn out

1271
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,940
I

1272
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,940
Would it's kind of a it's a it's a height of man

1273
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:59,340
I understand it's only the business and they're saying oh like the building whatever

1274
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:08,300
Last I checked. I don't think buildings have lightness, right? Yeah, and you know, isn't it kind of common to see famous landmarks in video games

1275
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:12,940
I mean how many games are out there that involve the White House, you know that you know

1276
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:17,980
Like in that alien shooting game was destroy all humans. You could blow up the White House, you know

1277
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:23,500
Or how about all the movies out there that have you know, New York City real story?

1278
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:28,180
Well, but usually though in a lot of those you're getting the permits to shoot at those locations

1279
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:31,820
But I guess not always because sometimes they shoot in Canada and make it look like the u.s

1280
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:38,180
Certain landmarks they do that channel game. It takes place in a fictional future that I

1281
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:45,180
Agreed there the church has somewhat of their panties in a bunch, but you know, it wouldn't pain Sony to go

1282
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:48,900
Look, sorry, we pissed you off our bad, but we're not going to recall the game bill

1283
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,220
Sorry that you're offended by this fuck off

1284
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:57,380
What would you like to see happen as a resolution insanest

1285
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,060
I would I would just like to see you know

1286
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,100
the church of England saying oh

1287
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:09,320
You should donate some money to a gun control education fund because those of you who aren't aware

1288
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:15,520
Where Manchester England is a horrible horrible gun problem. Um, I want to say a month and a half two months ago

1289
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:22,200
A 15 year old kid was killed taken identity. It was a gun crime. The kid got killed execution style. It was

1290
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,440
Not something you like reading well then that

1291
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,640
That's very unfortunate and that sounds like a very fair resolution as well

1292
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:34,080
You know that Sony donates a little money to charity all as well kiss and make up

1293
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,320
Yes

1294
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:43,840
But that's about it on that. Um, I would like to plug the insaneest hour. It's not STFU

1295
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,440
It's me making fun of stuff and swearing for an hour and playing music

1296
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,760
and there you go Ashley and we should say it here on the show this all kind of went down while I

1297
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:58,880
Was out of town and while the rest of us were on vacation, but STFU finally did

1298
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,680
Unfortunately, so we're sad to see it go, but that's all right

1299
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:08,960
It was over things with my employer who as I've been adamant will remain nameless. Yep

1300
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,320
So they're so I'm sorry. I'm sorry to see the STFU finally had to but hey, it was a good run

1301
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,080
You know, you still had some bigger names on STFU than we have in the five years of Orange Lounge radio

1302
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,680
And we're not we're not having anybody on like people think we're gonna have like these big surprise guests on next week

1303
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,880
There are no guests next week. Actually, there's nobody come out next week. I

1304
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:33,880
Was actually gonna come next week. I had things come down where the checkbook said no

1305
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,200
I know it's it's you know money happens. No, it's okay

1306
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,680
I think we're at a point now where we're actually gonna have no guests and that's kind of how we're gonna do it

1307
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,980
It's just gonna be the three of us next week

1308
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:46,160
But I'll tell you more about what's gonna happen next week a little later in the show. So well fine

1309
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:50,040
Why don't you just act like you're better than everybody and clamp yourself in your stupid?

1310
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:55,800
Orange Lounge room and do your own radio show for your fifth year anniversary and not share it with anybody else

1311
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:02,680
Oh, wait, you're radio. Yeah, I'll do that actually and you know how else I can assert that I'm better than you insaneist

1312
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:09,120
You're about to hang up on me. Yep. All right. Let's if you want to give us a call Orange Lounge radio on Skype

1313
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,160
1877 game olr. We'll do one more call. I'm such a dick

1314
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,000
But it's insaneist or DMN or whatever, you know, then the symbol he's have a symbol

1315
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,460
There whatever you want to call him. Oh, yeah. No one his name is

01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:28,860

1317
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:35,540
Are we we're not actually getting any more calls. It looks like so maybe maybe that's it

1318
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:39,900
I got a private message from insaneist. Oh, I got a heart. I got a less than three. Yay

1319
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:44,420
Alright, well then I guess that's it since no more calls are coming in. We'll go ahead and close up the skype line

1320
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:48,180
We had a lot of calls tonight. Anyway, I just thought I saw some other numbers popping up, but they must have stopped trying

1321
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,660
So that's about it. We're gonna wrap things up

1322
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:57,820
Let's go around and first ask if there's any last-minute stories anything last-minute that wants to be brought up tonight

1323
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,540
Loki usually have something. Yes, I do

1324
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:08,640
Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out Diablo is getting the movie

1325
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,100
Apparently

1326
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:18,260
Legendary pictures their website is listing Diablo movie as in development as

1327
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:22,580
As well as a clash of the Titans remake. Oh lord

1328
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:27,040
And they will they have the really bad dubbing like the world warcraft film. So, uh

1329
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,780
Excellent

1330
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,140
Let's see what else then again legendary pictures did the new Batman didn't they?

1331
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:40,980
Yeah, it's like a pretty fucking rad movie. So I you know, this may not be the end of the world

1332
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:46,140
Well with the halo 3 beta ending something else had to take its place, right?

1333
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:52,020
well going outside halo 3's viral marketing campaign has taken its place and

1334
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:57,620
Hello or move over I love bees and welcome

1335
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:04,540
Adjundant reflex and it's apparently this weird viral marketing campaign that they have going on clean people

1336
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,540
you know staying in the street with signs and

1337
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:11,780
Websites with calendars and whatnot. So if you want more info on that

1338
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:18,780
See, why are they standing in the street with signs the people that are waiting for halo 3 are playing Gears of War while they're waiting

1339
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:23,860
Well, they're not outside. This is part of the viral marketing campaign. So yeah

1340
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,820
Ace combat 6 is getting a limited edition

1341
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:33,180
Flightsick bundle that's gonna be coming out their team Bandai and Hori are teaming up to release

1342
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:40,820
It's gonna have this really elaborate flight stick, which I'm unaware of works for any other game other than Ace combat 6. So

1343
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:45,420
I might be looking at a what was it? Another mecha not mecha saw them

1344
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,260
Jamie help me here

1345
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,260
stupid game with a very large

1346
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,100
control stick

1347
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,100
Mecha, oh

1348
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,100
So but yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you

1349
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,660
And then this rumor just won't die

1350
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:03,640
apparently Matt Casamani from

1351
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:10,080
IGN posted a while back about halo on the DS. Well, apparently in their latest podcast

1352
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:17,640
They said it's a real game. We're gonna lay down some ownage next week or soon afterwards showing you guys that it's a real game. So

1353
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,560
IGN will probably have info about halo DS

1354
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,400
Soon what the hell?

1355
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,720
And I thoughts exactly

1356
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,960
Yeah, that's all I have is cares. I

1357
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,760
I

1358
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:37,320
Mean like they're they're like, I don't know to me the way you read that and I don't know if that's the way you poster

1359
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,920
If you bell short, but it sounds like they're like kind of just like they're like

1360
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:46,640
We've got a big cock cuz we knew that halo was really on the DS and we're gonna prove it

1361
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,640
I mean who cares if the game never came out. I

1362
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,280
Mean why I'm supposed to look at like oh look how this game was almost like completely bad

1363
01:19:54,280 --> 01:20:01,040
Well, in other news, there's a video of Diablo for the Game Boy online. So I heard about that, you know, whatever all

1364
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,840
right

1365
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,840
Dar sucker you have anything last minute?

1366
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,520
I'm sorry, is this show not living up to your expectations tonight?

1367
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:14,080
I had a headache most of the show is this just oh, I'm sorry to hear that

1368
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:20,940
Because your body screamed in my ear both of you take two of these on neupron little you know different

1369
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:24,740
I needed the Wayne's World reference version

1370
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:29,840
Because the other one was little yellow different better was the real commercial anyhow

1371
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:35,620
And what happened to new print now? I think I was reading up on it on Wikipedia once

1372
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:38,260
I think they got bought by somebody else, but I don't care anymore. I don't care enough

1373
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,820
Anyhow, let's talk about next week since we're at the end of the show

1374
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:45,940
I'm next week is our fifth anniversary show and for the fifth anniversary show

1375
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:50,340
It's just going to be Loki dark soccer and myself. We're not gonna have any special guests this week

1376
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:55,020
We're gonna kind of celebrate our fifth year anniversary by doing nothing because it's what we do best

1377
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,900
beer

1378
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,240
There might be a little bit of liquid celebration

1379
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,880
But no actually the other thing we're gonna do is that you know

1380
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:06,540
We were actually bouncing some ideas around we were gonna use some of our ties to try and get some big names on the show

1381
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:11,240
But we figure now why not? Well, we'll save that for later on down the line and through the summer and stuff. So

1382
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,780
what we're gonna do next week is that for part a we're gonna do our normal gaming show and do the

1383
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,780
The

1384
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,800
Usual gaming news and everything that we usually do but part B

1385
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:28,880
What we're gonna do next week is we're gonna open up the skype line for all of part B because orange lounge radio

1386
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:35,320
You know when we started we were all about interaction remember kind of like the way we always talked about our show

1387
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,880
Is that if we'll remember like when we used to go play DDR?

1388
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,780
We would go to Brookfield's after and sit around and talk shit and talk about games and such games cool that

1389
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:46,060
Orange lounge radio is but on the radio

1390
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:50,700
So for part B, we're gonna get out the dinner table. Like we're at Denny's or whatever diner

1391
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:57,140
We'll just order some pizza pizza and we're gonna open up the skype line and we're gonna have you guys call in and just talk

1392
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:02,700
Shit with us for a few hours about games and everything. And if you guys want to pass on your congratulations, that's cool, too

1393
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:06,980
Whatever you want to do for, you know, it's gonna be your man. I remember the first show though

1394
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:09,540
I know some good times. I was in this chair

1395
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:17,360
Uh-huh passed out with a migraine and the second show man, that was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room

1396
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:22,720
And patrese is in chat and says yay. We can hear the same three people for an hour

1397
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,860
Well, we're hoping that that won't happen

1398
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:30,860
We're actually kind of hoping that maybe some folks might drive drop in on the skype line that you wouldn't expect

1399
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:35,980
So who knows we're hoping to get some callers. We may not usually get on the program. That's

1400
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:40,860
What we're looking at for next week to get this guy from the sky. That'd be funny possibly

1401
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,180
I mean who knows who's gonna call in next week, so

1402
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:44,860
We'll see

1403
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,500
We're gonna put the call out there

1404
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,360
But we do want our listeners to get in on it too because even those folks that have

1405
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:54,400
Even the same three people that always call in definitely make this show a part of what it is

1406
01:22:54,660 --> 01:23:00,040
So if you've never listened live before and you want to get in next week is an excellent chance to do that again

1407
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:05,860
We tape live at six o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our life 365 station more information can be found at orange lounge

1408
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:13,220
Radio calm I do I do know that next week's discussion will be quite interesting after all we are getting close to e3

1409
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:18,840
Are you saying that even though you got slapped on the wrist about something a while ago?

1410
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:25,260
Possibly next week. You're gonna spill some big-ass beans. I don't know. Maybe maybe thinking about it

1411
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:30,340
It's cross my mind across your mind. Stay tuned. That could be fun. All right

1412
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,900
anyhow

1413
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:38,140
We're gonna wrap it up for this week. Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and listening to orange lounge radio

1414
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,140
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts

1415
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:44,580
Explicit sorry, we didn't have like a fourth mic or something to get in on the action more often

1416
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:47,220
well, we appreciate you being here as always it's all good and

1417
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:50,180
Again, keep it up with the Wii cosplay and whatever

1418
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,980
Creative cosplays you come up with

1419
01:23:53,300 --> 01:24:00,300
It'll show up an anime Expo and sack anime as well. Awesome. When is sack anime? It's July 13th through 15th

1420
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:06,460
We want to make an appearance somehow. So I'm gonna be there. Yeah, I want to be staff there now

1421
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:09,680
Can we do a panel or something? Yeah, get us panel. I'll see what I can do

1422
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:13,380
I'll tell you to um, I'll talk to the management and tell me no internet celebrities

1423
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:19,700
I'll put it up about I think don't lie. They trust me, but they trust me a lot now. So, all right, sounds good

1424
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,520
Exactly you want to ruin your rep real fast

1425
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:29,420
I'm a good rep. I'm a good rep with this is really really disgusting. All right, I know

1426
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:30,540
uh

1427
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:35,700
Loki your final thought it smells bad. Stay tuned for the afterbirth

1428
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,140
That's my final thought if you're listening live. Otherwise, you're seeing live dark soccer

1429
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:47,140
I feel really stupid because I deleted almost everything out of my FTP including in the banner for my live journals

1430
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,860
I have to go home and re-upload it

1431
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:52,120
It's like the via was dying. So in three days I get in my

1432
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:59,300
Computer that was given to me by vandalism is going to be up and running and I need to think of a clever name for

1433
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,300
it

1434
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,700
um, my final thought is

1435
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:09,700
Now I want ice cream I didn't want ice cream a couple hours ago, but now I have chocolate mint pudding at home

1436
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,220
