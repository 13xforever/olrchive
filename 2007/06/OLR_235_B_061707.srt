3
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:24,693
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, the 17th of June, 2007.

5
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:29,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Father's Day again to those of you folks that are gamer daddies.

6
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:31,013
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna get back into the gaming news.

7
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, Orange Launch Radio is released in two parts.

8
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you haven't listened to Part A, you missed a lot tonight.

9
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:41,696
[SPEAKER_13]: So please, go back to wherever you got this show and make sure you've tuned in to Part A. Let's continue on with tonight's program.

10
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:44,237
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm gonna start us off with some more gaming news in this segment.

11
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:48,578
[SPEAKER_13]: We talked a lot about PlayStation 3 and a little bit about computer games.

12
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Started to dip into Xbox a little bit in the last segment.

13
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,519
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't really mention the Wii a whole lot.

14
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:53,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Madden 2008

15
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:12,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

16
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Madden 08 is not going to use that.

17
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:36,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Quote, Madden Wii doesn't support the Wii's friend system during online play.

18
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,904
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something we're still working on with Nintendo.

19
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:45,568
[SPEAKER_13]: For now, our online play uses your EA Nation persona to search and manage your EA Messenger account.

20
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,310
[SPEAKER_13]: So now you're going to have to balance this whole other thing.

21
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:48,710
[SPEAKER_13]: But what?

22
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:52,433
[SPEAKER_14]: What if this is something that they're going to support through all their EA games?

23
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is fine, then, if they're going to do that.

24
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:58,634
[SPEAKER_14]: as long as it's not... I mean, you can call their friend code wherever you want.

25
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:01,259
[SPEAKER_14]: If you gotta enter one in for each game, who gives a shit?

26
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:01,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean...

27
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:05,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I just kind of wish Nintendo would just wake up.

28
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:08,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're saying we're having problems with Nintendo.

29
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is Nintendo holding back on this stuff?

30
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:13,157
[SPEAKER_13]: That's obviously what's going on here.

31
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:14,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo's done this with the DS.

32
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:18,121
[SPEAKER_13]: They held back on so much of what the DS actually had in it.

33
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,824
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't launch DS online until like a year and a half after the system was out.

34
00:02:22,264 --> 00:02:27,448
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there was also the whole microphone and the voice chatting is just now happening.

35
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:31,832
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if Nintendo likes to time release the features of their system to...

36
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:35,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Make it last longer or what the deal is, but it's weird.

37
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:36,193
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

38
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:36,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Explicit?

39
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was more technical issues.

40
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:42,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, but it just seems to me like, you know, you're not seeing any online games.

41
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,336
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's because no one wants to do it.

42
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:48,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's because Nintendo's kind of keeping some secrets down or something like that.

43
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:56,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Bandit in chatroom says, Online play doesn't start until Nintendo says so, and the next gen doesn't start until Sony says so.

44
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,481
[SPEAKER_13]: SSJ100 Matt being very random in our chatroom, chat.orangellonsradio.com

45
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:03,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Nintendo, bring back the Game Boy printer.

46
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:10,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, knowing Nintendo, maybe there'll be something to attach it to later, to, like, print out your me or something like that.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
[SPEAKER_13]: RossDLUT brings up a good point.

48
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,523
[SPEAKER_13]: EA could easily just say, no Madden for the Wii unless you stop with the friend codes.

49
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:20,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, though.

50
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:29,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's, you know, still... Wii's selling pretty good to an audience that, you know, may not necessarily have a 360, so I think you still want to get Madden out to that audience somehow.

51
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:30,489
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

52
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:40,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Madden Wii is going to get some other funny features in there as well, including some minigames, Mii integration, and the ability to draw on the screen.

53
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, you too can be just like John Madden and draw on the screen with the brand new Wii Telestrator.

54
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,044
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of funny.

55
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:56,197
[SPEAKER_14]: and, of course, like FIFA and some of the other games that are coming out, you will be able to integrate your Mii in there.

56
00:03:56,397 --> 00:04:03,619
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to have a whole set of Mii games, kind of similar, I'm guessing, to Madden 07, you know, just field training and whatnot.

57
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:16,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so you can sketch all over the board like it was, you know, real football and everything, but the $64,000 question is, will you be able to write out boobs on the prompt, on the little thing?

58
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:16,881
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you can.

59
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,682
[SPEAKER_13]: How very un-Nintendo-like.

60
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:20,042
Amen.

61
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:21,892
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that on there?

62
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:26,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, Nintendo's supposed to be releasing a child porn game for the DS.

63
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:28,614
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

64
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:29,354
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

65
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,435
[SPEAKER_14]: That is Namco.

66
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:32,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Or SNK, I'm sorry.

67
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:32,915
[SPEAKER_14]: SNK.

68
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:40,737
[SPEAKER_14]: The only new game that they're putting out was that stupid, you know, touch the, you know, witches thing to see if they're witches and you flick their boobs and shit.

69
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,058
[SPEAKER_14]: What in the fuck are you talking about?

70
00:04:43,078 --> 00:04:45,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you should read some more Kotaku, okay?

71
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:46,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Or something.

72
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,759
[SPEAKER_13]: There's at least one story a day about this damn game.

73
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a break.

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a break.

75
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,311
[SPEAKER_13]: There's like 50,000 game blogs out there I'm trying to juggle.

76
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,865
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's a lot of touching of, you know, women, and you flick their boobs and stuff.

77
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm poking Jamie to see if she's a witch right now, actually.

78
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,791
[SPEAKER_13]: She's about ready to break her bottle.

79
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:28,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I beard you.

80
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:29,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I beard you.

81
00:05:30,294 --> 00:05:30,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

82
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:33,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie does not like to be poked and declared a witch.

83
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:35,858
[SPEAKER_14]: And Matt in 08 will be online.

84
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:36,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a witch.

85
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:37,159
[SPEAKER_01]: May we burn her?

86
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:37,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

87
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Burn the witch.

88
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,262
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, they're going to have a two-on-two, um...

89
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:46,863
[SPEAKER_14]: versus Mode as well for the minigames, so that's kind of cool.

90
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:49,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Madden 2008 featuring hot two-on-two action.

91
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:55,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have some happy news, like none of us didn't see this coming.

92
00:05:56,406 --> 00:06:01,367
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii and the DS are outselling their Sony counterparts with a vengeance.

93
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:03,647
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been 338,000 units sold in May.

94
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,048
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

95
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:38,652
[SPEAKER_08]: and, dear God, why anyone would want the Spider-Man 3 game, because it wasn't all that good, and Pokemon Pearl.

96
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:42,756
[SPEAKER_08]: And Wii Play was on number five, so isn't that cool?

97
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Not really, because the game kind of blows.

98
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:45,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So guess what?

99
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,520
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

100
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,442
[SPEAKER_08]: The same thing is happening in Japan.

101
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:49,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

102
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Like any of us are surprised.

103
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:56,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So, dear Sony, bite our asses, not love me.

104
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:00,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone's a little bitter over Sony right now.

105
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:00,964
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up with this?

106
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Why all of a sudden Sony angst?

107
00:07:03,346 --> 00:07:06,930
[SPEAKER_13]: You weren't swayed by anything you heard about the agency in Part A?

108
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

109
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:09,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Parappa?

110
00:07:10,493 --> 00:07:10,673
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

111
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:11,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Silent Hill 5?

112
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:12,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Parappa!

113
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction is going to be awesome.

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Project Hammer has been cancelled.

115
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:20,663
[SPEAKER_13]: IGN has moved on to look at some more expanded audience projects.

116
00:07:46,277 --> 00:07:47,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever that is supposed to mean.

117
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:52,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully it's something original no matter what it is.

118
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,781
[SPEAKER_13]: But there it is.

119
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:55,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo, by the way, has not released an official statement.

120
00:07:55,742 --> 00:08:02,506
[SPEAKER_13]: But some folks have kind of seen this coming for a little while because Project Hammer went into this mysterious TBA status on its website.

121
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,188
[SPEAKER_13]: And it has yet to move from that status.

122
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:06,829
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

123
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:13,272
[SPEAKER_13]: It was supposed to be a very interesting plot where you had a hammer-wielding cyborg and you're protecting the U.S.

124
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:14,433
[SPEAKER_13]: from killer robots.

125
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,061
[SPEAKER_13]: MC Hammer do the voice for Project Hammer.

126
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:39,919
[SPEAKER_14]: That would have been so appropriate.

127
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you can't touch this game now.

128
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,481
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been cancelled, actually.

129
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:44,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Hammer, don't let them hurt you.

130
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:49,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Did either of you guys see this at E3 last year when we were all there?

131
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:50,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I remember Project Hammer.

132
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:53,548
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they still had it on the website, on Nintendo's website.

133
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this is a rumor.

134
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,891
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not officially cancelled, but all signs point to... I don't know.

135
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:05,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, just working in the retail and distribution side, there's a lot of things that go cancelled for a while and then come back.

136
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:05,776
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just because...

137
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:06,998
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

138
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Loki, for bringing down the maturity level of this show to a whole new low.

139
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:33,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

140
00:09:33,735 --> 00:09:34,755
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

141
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:38,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Just real quick, some chat comments from chat room.

142
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:43,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma says, Interesting.

143
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it didn't look that bad.

144
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, considering that the Wii just simply isn't as powerful as the other systems.

145
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:52,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there you go.

146
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:53,143
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

147
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:01,578
[SPEAKER_14]: So, another interesting game coming out to the DS is going to be Taika No Touch in DS.

148
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:10,601
[SPEAKER_14]: And Taika No Touch in DS is going to have these two little kind of cute stylus drum things, I guess, for it.

149
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,202
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're going to be able to beat the screen like a taiko drum.

150
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Aren't the styluses kind of already drumsticks?

151
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:22,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but it's two of them now, so you have two of them that you can drum the screen with.

152
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,840
[SPEAKER_13]: But your DS actually comes with two styluses.

153
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,622
[SPEAKER_13]: They give you a spare in there, and yet you still lose these little bastards everywhere.

154
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:34,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe if my wife lost the stylus.

155
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:36,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever, who cares?

156
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,787
[SPEAKER_14]: You get two free styluses with it.

157
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:38,467
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

158
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:39,788
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can play this game once.

159
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:41,023
[SPEAKER_13]: You just figured.

160
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:12,935
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

161
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:43,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, there is something that a bunch of us have played several times, I'm sure, if we had any real video game taste, which those of us in this room do.

162
00:11:44,044 --> 00:11:55,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So, wonderfully, it is now Europe's virtual console's 100th game, F-Zero X, which is like freaking rad.

163
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:59,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember playing a ton of F-Zero X. You know what's funny?

164
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:02,178
[SPEAKER_13]: F-Zero X is the one F-Zero game I didn't play.

165
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,163
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I played the one on the Super Nintendo, definitely the GameCube one, which was so underrated.

166
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:09,865
[SPEAKER_07]: F-Zero X was like hotness.

167
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe they'll release it here.

168
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:12,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that's a good sign that it's coming here.

169
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can come to my house and play it on my Nintendo 64.

170
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,951
[SPEAKER_13]: You're actually going to hook that shit up just so we can play F-Zero X?

171
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:17,892
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can find it, I will.

172
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:18,733
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, it's a date.

173
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:20,414
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll hook it up on my Nintendo 64.

174
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:22,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right, I threw mine away in a dumpster.

175
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I still have my Nintendo 64 in a box somewhere.

176
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,342
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't find my Dreamcast, though.

177
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:28,662
[SPEAKER_14]: I have...

178
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:41,274
[SPEAKER_13]: all the accessories for the Dreamcast I think I'm missing a box I also have a Dreamcast sitting in a box over there that's not being used I want to use it as a Nintendo emulator and play some Guardian Legend again

179
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:43,331
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

180
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Put them on this cartridge and play pirated old school Nintendo games to your heart's content.

181
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,260
[SPEAKER_13]: And it will only cost you $135 if you get one of these things.

182
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:18,742
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

183
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:45,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, compact flash readers are not exactly cheap pieces of equipment and the whole thing.

184
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:52,092
[SPEAKER_14]: We were joking, myself and my wife were joking, because we saw another one of those iPhone commercials that they have on TV.

185
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:56,275
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all, this isn't just, you know, the internet for phone.

186
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,337
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't, you know, scaled down internet.

187
00:13:58,357 --> 00:13:59,118
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the real internet.

188
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,839
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, it better be the fucking real internet for $600.

189
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:05,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And then she's like, you should say that about every feature on it.

190
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, yeah, it better fucking be for $600.

191
00:14:08,826 --> 00:14:10,627
[SPEAKER_14]: There's lots of people waiting for their iPhones.

192
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:11,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this.

193
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:12,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, shit.

194
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:16,109
[SPEAKER_14]: It better be everything that they promise it will be because it's $600.

195
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:27,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently the AMA is debating on whether to recognize game addiction as a real addiction.

196
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:41,718
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, they're going to be debating about it and looking at all the facts and sooner or later we will have something for someone to talk about saying, hey, game addiction's real, see?

197
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:44,900
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just like alcoholism.

198
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,801
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a disease.

199
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,365
[SPEAKER_14]: How exactly does one go about debating game addiction?

200
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:51,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking fine, though.

201
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:53,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

202
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:59,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Exploring the possible dangers of excessive video game playing that's over two hours a day.

203
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:03,035
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

204
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:32,094
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

205
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:54,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you going with this exactly?

206
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,248
[SPEAKER_08]: These people don't have addiction to gaming.

207
00:15:56,268 --> 00:16:01,689
[SPEAKER_08]: They're obsessive-compulsive, and gaming just happens to be the object of their disorder.

208
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, rebuttal.

209
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, still though, that's technically game addiction.

210
00:16:08,011 --> 00:16:09,011
[SPEAKER_14]: They're addicted to games.

211
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:15,053
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, with OCD or whatever, they're not drinking tons of alcohol.

212
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:18,434
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not gambling or anything like that.

213
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:19,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Gambling is also obsessive-compulsive.

214
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:31,608
[SPEAKER_14]: True, these are all... Okay, well, I can have lung cancer or I can have cancer, but it doesn't mean it's necessarily lung cancer or not necessarily from smoking or something.

215
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:32,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you saying games give you cancer?

216
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:38,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Addiction, I think, requires ingestion of a particular substance that your body eventually becomes dependent upon.

217
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:43,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Having a physical thing that you are...

218
00:16:43,974 --> 00:16:49,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Obsessively Compulsed to Participate in is not the same as a physical addiction.

219
00:16:49,277 --> 00:17:09,807
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that by doing this task over and over again, your brain chemicals are saying, hey, I like this and I want to keep doing this, as opposed to you actually having a physical addiction to a substance that your body is starting to need to maintain a particular level of normalcy, I guess.

220
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,849
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're basically saying World of Warcraft is not an injectable substance.

221
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:13,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

222
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:14,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Rebuttal.

223
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:21,538
[SPEAKER_14]: How many weekends have you skipped going out with friends and stuff to play World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI?

224
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:24,580
[SPEAKER_13]: You're pointing at me and like maybe one.

225
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he knows that I haven't done it.

226
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:27,843
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was sad and fat.

227
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:29,368
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're going to point at me.

228
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:32,409
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not sad anymore.

229
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,911
[SPEAKER_13]: You just lost the debate, bitch.

230
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,111
[SPEAKER_13]: You insulted the ref.

231
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:38,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki is the winner, ladies and gentlemen.

232
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:41,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave it to the chatroom to vote.

233
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Chatroom vote.

234
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, our opinions don't matter.

235
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:46,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the chatroom's vote.

236
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:50,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, anything else you wish to add in all seriousness?

237
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:58,063
[SPEAKER_14]: No, seriously, gaming addiction as something that needs to be treated or something...

238
00:17:58,953 --> 00:17:59,533
[SPEAKER_14]: That's retarded.

239
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:03,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking parents need to step in and just fucking say, Stop playing your damn games!

240
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:07,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Or if you're older, just have your girlfriend say, Stop playing your damn games!

241
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:08,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is what you have.

242
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm putting my drugs for OCD.

243
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:16,421
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how Loki curbed his gaming addiction, is he married a woman that will pull the plug on him.

244
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:18,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I still play two hours of games a day, if that.

245
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:19,502
[SPEAKER_14]: More than that.

246
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:22,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, then what's my excuse?

247
00:18:22,263 --> 00:18:27,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a massive gamer, married my husband, and now I don't really play that much anymore, except for pinball.

248
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:32,458
[SPEAKER_08]: He still plays more than I do.

249
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:33,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

250
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,060
[SPEAKER_08]: He's welcome to as long as he leaves me alone.

251
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's going to be another kiss with Jack Thompson about this.

252
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:42,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, ah, ah, ah, no.

253
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,569
[SPEAKER_01]: He who shall not be named.

254
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:47,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Explicit hasn't been here in a year.

255
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,038
[SPEAKER_13]: He doesn't know about some of our banning topics.

256
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:53,601
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not mention his name in these circles.

257
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:57,884
[SPEAKER_13]: It's code name Lord Voldemort is actually what we refer to him as on the show.

258
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:01,947
[SPEAKER_13]: So whenever you hear Lord Voldemort, that's JT.

259
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,110
[SPEAKER_13]: G4 was banned too, but somebody else brought it up earlier.

260
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Leave it to Loki to bring that up.

261
00:19:07,691 --> 00:19:08,111
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

262
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:13,195
[SPEAKER_13]: GS191 sums it up.

263
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,275
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's your cure.

264
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Marriage cures gaming addiction.

265
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Examples, Loki and DarkSakura.

266
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,197
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it doesn't.

267
00:19:18,597 --> 00:19:19,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I still play.

268
00:19:19,497 --> 00:19:20,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I was never addicted.

269
00:19:20,938 --> 00:19:23,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's no such thing as gaming addiction.

270
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:25,299
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not addicted to games.

271
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:26,280
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like this.

272
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,402
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife doesn't like the fact that I talk about games a lot.

273
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, well, I work in the games industry.

274
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,163
[SPEAKER_14]: I play games.

275
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I do this show.

276
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:48,002
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm, you know, talking about work, you know, my outside stuff, what I'm doing, and unfortunately that all comes back to games, because it all has something to do with games, usually.

277
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:49,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I think about movies, though.

278
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:50,403
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot about movies.

279
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:51,404
[SPEAKER_14]: And Transformers.

280
00:19:51,824 --> 00:20:02,669
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um... Still, though, it's just... There... I don't think... I think there's, you know, people have addictive behavior, but these people, if games weren't around, they'd be addicted to something else.

281
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:05,391
[SPEAKER_14]: So... Whatever.

282
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Just fucking...

283
00:20:07,256 --> 00:20:08,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Be responsible people.

284
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:09,859
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what people need to do.

285
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:11,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

286
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:12,302
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all done.

287
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:13,104
[SPEAKER_13]: The debate's over.

288
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:15,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie already lost because she made fun of the ref.

289
00:20:15,246 --> 00:20:15,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

290
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:19,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's... But Rob, I do that all the time.

291
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,092
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because I love you.

292
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:21,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

293
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:22,852
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, who emailed us this week?

294
00:20:22,872 --> 00:20:23,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people.

295
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:55,994
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of people, and I'm not reading all these fucking emails, so I'll just, like, start here.

296
00:20:57,194 --> 00:20:59,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this one comes from Osfer.

297
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:01,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's Osfer again.

298
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I swear I wasn't drunk, Osfer.

299
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:04,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, shush.

300
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:05,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

301
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:10,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Since I lack a high-speed connection, I always have to go to a friend's house and wirelessly download your podcast to my PSP.

302
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:15,039
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a few weeks since I last listened to this show, so I downloaded all that I could up to the current podcast.

303
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:18,600
[SPEAKER_08]: An episode a few weeks ago, I found hilarious that Rob called his mom...

304
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,219
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to find out some things that we never knew about him.

305
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how he dressed up as Courtney Love in lip syncs.

306
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we really have to bring that up again?

307
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Good lord, you guys should find a video and upload it to the site if you can.

308
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:31,982
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not retelling the story for your benefit explicitly.

309
00:21:32,002 --> 00:21:32,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Go download the podcast.

310
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:37,784
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still a... One week there should be a Parents of OLR show where you all call your parents or bring them on the show.

311
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:41,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure some more interesting things could be revealed about you guys.

312
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:42,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, thanks for reading.

313
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:47,667
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if we got my mom out here, that would be great because I want to get my mom to California.

314
00:21:48,952 --> 00:22:16,234
[SPEAKER_13]: and for me it was kind of like a one time joke like you know sequels aren't ever as good as the original it was kind of like a one time joke it happened that was the Mother's Day show by the way where that happened so there you have it no but that was good my mom did great on the show considering she really did have no idea we have considering she had no idea we were calling her live she did a great job so I was very proud of her so the next email dun dun dun if you're ready hey you know it's that person again but this is great

315
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:21,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I give you ten random questions spurred from my void of boredom.

316
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:23,055
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Ossifer again?

317
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:23,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

318
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I still am not drunk, Ossifer, I swear.

319
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,197
[SPEAKER_08]: One, freeze.

320
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:28,399
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you all doing right now at this moment?

321
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:29,640
[SPEAKER_08]: The fucking show?

322
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we're doing a radio show.

323
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:32,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, Loki is not doing a radio show.

324
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:38,986
[SPEAKER_13]: I can clearly see, plain as day, Loki is playing on some Transformers-related website and not paying attention to the mailbag.

325
00:22:39,286 --> 00:22:40,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, now, this is game-related.

326
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,928
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the opening cinematic for Transformers the game.

327
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:43,529
[SPEAKER_14]: So, huh!

328
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:45,538
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm paying attention.

329
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:46,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got served.

330
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:47,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Two.

331
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you can move now.

332
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,320
[SPEAKER_08]: What is your favorite drink that helps you get up and go?

333
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:52,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Coffee.

334
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:54,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Tea.

335
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki's stacking Pepsi cans over there.

336
00:22:59,143 --> 00:22:59,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, water.

337
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:01,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Or coffee.

338
00:23:01,744 --> 00:23:02,865
[SPEAKER_13]: If I need caffeine, coffee.

339
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise, I drink a crap load of water.

340
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,106
[SPEAKER_13]: But tonight, it's Malibu and root beer.

341
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:10,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Which isn't as bad of a combination as you might think.

342
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:12,088
[SPEAKER_13]: How many questions?

343
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:13,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, this is ten random questions you said?

344
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh boy, it's only a three-hour show.

345
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:17,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's keep it moving.

346
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:18,806
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the capital of Germany?

347
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:22,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Wienerschnitzel.

348
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:24,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Four.

349
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:27,391
[SPEAKER_08]: What is your favorite song on either Beatmania 2DX or DDR?

350
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:30,372
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the Germany question is still bugging me.

351
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:33,394
[SPEAKER_13]: It was the city that was separated for so long.

352
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:34,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Berlin.

353
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:34,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Berlin?

354
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:35,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it was Berlin.

355
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:36,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Berlin, the band.

356
00:23:37,436 --> 00:23:37,976
[SPEAKER_08]: On the metro.

357
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Wienerschnitzel, though.

358
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:42,298
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for the questions.

359
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:43,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's it?

360
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:43,976
[SPEAKER_13]: No more questions?

361
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:44,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to read any more.

362
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:48,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear Orange Lounge Radio, there needs to be an Oregon Trail for the DS, dammit.

363
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:55,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd prefer it be based on Oregon Trail 2 engine, but considering the chances of it coming out, I'd be happy anyways.

364
00:23:55,942 --> 00:23:57,303
[SPEAKER_08]: What are other things y'all wish for?

365
00:23:57,343 --> 00:23:59,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps even more Actraiser for Sky if he insists.

366
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:03,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, though not related to gaming, there should be a Deadpool movie.

367
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:04,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

368
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:07,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless they royally screw it up like X-Men 3, then I'd cry forever.

369
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:09,690
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Tim Surugi.

370
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:18,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I had to look up on Wikipedia what the capital of Germany was because I didn't want to look like a dumb shit any more than I already do on the entire internet.

371
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,141
[SPEAKER_13]: It is Berlin, by the way.

372
00:24:19,181 --> 00:24:23,322
[SPEAKER_08]: If they did a Deadpool movie, they'd have to get the guy that does his voice in the game because he was the Crypt Keeper.

373
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:28,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, what was our emailer emailing us about?

374
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:29,264
[SPEAKER_13]: I was too busy on Wikipedia.

375
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:31,325
[SPEAKER_08]: What else would I see on DS that was old school gaming?

376
00:24:32,594 --> 00:24:34,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Besides the mandatory Guardian Legend answer.

377
00:24:35,897 --> 00:24:36,337
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you know what?

378
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:38,239
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to see retro games on the DS.

379
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,822
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see retro games on consoles I can play on my TV just like the old retro games.

380
00:24:43,603 --> 00:24:43,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Zero.

381
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,325
[SPEAKER_13]: There's nothing I want to see on DS that's retro.

382
00:24:46,865 --> 00:24:47,406
[SPEAKER_14]: MDK.

383
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,308
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty old school.

384
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:51,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be fun.

385
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I like me some MDK.

386
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Did they ever make a sequel to MDK?

387
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:56,673
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought they had one.

388
00:24:56,713 --> 00:24:57,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, they did, unfortunately.

389
00:24:58,087 --> 00:25:02,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Insanest is yelling in chatroom, Archon, Archon, Archon, over and over again.

390
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:03,312
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a pretty awesome game.

391
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:03,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give you that.

392
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:06,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Or Starcon.

393
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:07,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I say nothing.

394
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:10,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

395
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,183
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's too long, and I'm just going to end up posting it on the forums anyway.

396
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:17,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

397
00:25:17,464 --> 00:25:17,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

398
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:24,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I also got an email from one of the people who emailed me in French.

399
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:27,943
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, thank you for replying to my email.

400
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:30,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like such a star when you read my letter.

401
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:32,807
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not used to all this.

402
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:35,029
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, you guys are talking about Sony a whole lot.

403
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for making the effort.

404
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And I might have to go and pick up a Pokemon game or two.

405
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:40,193
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys seem to really love them.

406
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:45,646
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to be honest, we didn't really change anything in the creation of the show.

407
00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:49,707
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just that I guess the weeks you were listening previous, there just was a lot of Xbox-heavy news.

408
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:54,949
[SPEAKER_13]: But right now, there seems to be actually more Sony and PC news this week.

409
00:25:55,329 --> 00:25:58,950
[SPEAKER_13]: So it just depends on the flow of news, what we cover.

410
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,351
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, that was Spamouflage.

411
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:04,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that name.

412
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:04,831
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a pretty rad name.

413
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:06,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm not going to read any more e-mails.

414
00:26:08,554 --> 00:26:09,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Are the emailers being punished?

415
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:10,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll read one.

416
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:11,595
[SPEAKER_13]: One more, alright.

417
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:12,476
[SPEAKER_08]: From AZHP.

418
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:12,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

419
00:26:14,237 --> 00:26:20,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi guys, I was listening to your podcast on the way to class today and I noticed you guys talking about how Mario Party 8 backups don't work on the Wii.

420
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:28,603
[SPEAKER_08]: As I am a college student and I back up my games so that I don't have to lug around DVD cases back and forth, I'm mentioning this so I don't get you guys in trouble for talking of piracy.

421
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:33,325
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I've also contributed to the design of a Wii mod ship for this purpose.

422
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:36,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I can confirm that Mario Party 8 backups work fine.

423
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:37,757
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

424
00:26:59,179 --> 00:26:59,659
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

425
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,879
[SPEAKER_08]: That brings me to my question for you guys.

426
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:29,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it's possible for a company to stop piracy in its tracks?

427
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:29,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck no.

428
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:31,782
[SPEAKER_08]: That was me, by the way.

429
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:38,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that the funds invested in stopping piracy is greater than the potential loss incurred from allowing it to run rampant?

430
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:41,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not asking if the monetary value of the pirated goods is significant.

431
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:42,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously it is.

432
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:49,613
[SPEAKER_08]: However, most people who pirate wouldn't buy nearly the same amount of games as they are pirating.

433
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:55,780
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you think it's the company's best interest to stop modding, or do you think it's something that they do in order to appease uneducated shareholders?

434
00:27:56,461 --> 00:27:57,282
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question.

435
00:27:57,462 --> 00:28:01,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is not in their interest, but I want to hear your two cents.

436
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:02,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry for the long email.

437
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:03,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you guys enjoyed it.

438
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:03,887
[SPEAKER_08]: AZHB.

439
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:08,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's part of it, too.

440
00:28:08,871 --> 00:28:17,618
[SPEAKER_08]: The average boardroom suit and tie person is only going to look at numbers.

441
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:24,725
[SPEAKER_08]: They're only going to look at face value good idea because, remember, once you get into upper management, you turn into a moron.

442
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:27,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, someone's jaded.

443
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right, I understand.

444
00:28:30,787 --> 00:28:34,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that some of it is for, you know, face.

445
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:41,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of it is, I think, they want to discourage the casual pirates.

446
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,623
[SPEAKER_08]: These people said, oh, I can just clip this on the back of my PlayStation and I can play whatever, blah, blah, blah.

447
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:49,405
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to discourage those people who don't know what the fuck they're doing.

448
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:54,749
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of us who know what we're doing, there's not going to be any way that they can stop us if we try hard enough.

449
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,731
[SPEAKER_08]: If we care enough.

450
00:28:57,491 --> 00:29:07,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's my thing, is that with no disrespect to the emailer, you go to all this trouble to back up games because you don't want to haul DVD cases around.

451
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I really supposed to believe that?

452
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:14,146
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I guess.

453
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:14,767
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's possible.

454
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:18,908
[SPEAKER_13]: It just seems to me like that's... It's not that I'm saying like, oh, you're a thief or whatever.

455
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:22,450
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just like, that seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to.

456
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to not have to carry around DVD cases, which aren't that big a deal.

457
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:38,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Better yet, if you're backing up a game, say, onto another DVD to play it on your system, aren't you still carrying around that DVD?

458
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:41,237
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just now it's a backed up one instead of the real one.

459
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:43,433
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't understand how that's cutting down on DVDs.

460
00:29:43,894 --> 00:29:47,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, our chat room is chiming in here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

461
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:54,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Blackwolf, our old buddy who just turned 100 today, said, we tried to stop them, but they always get by what we do.

462
00:29:55,103 --> 00:29:58,986
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds better than, well, we won't do anything because they'll get around it anyway.

463
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:03,910
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's a good point, kind of going back to the boardroom things going on there.

464
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,234
[SPEAKER_13]: NintendoManiac64 says, backing up DS and GBA games is very helpful, though.

465
00:30:10,413 --> 00:30:10,973
[SPEAKER_13]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

466
00:30:35,472 --> 00:30:36,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Halo 3 Controllers and Headsets

467
00:30:52,364 --> 00:30:54,306
[SPEAKER_13]: and this is going to be coming out from GameStop.

468
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:55,527
[SPEAKER_13]: At least GameStop is now listing them.

469
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:56,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's going to have them.

470
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's going to have them but GameStop has kind of spilled the beans on it.

471
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:06,295
[SPEAKER_13]: This is $59.99 for the wireless controllers because you're going to pay $10 more because they have pretty pictures on them.

472
00:31:06,756 --> 00:31:13,421
[SPEAKER_13]: One has the Spartan, one has the Covenant and then there is also a green headset that's going to be coming out.

473
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see the price for this one.

474
00:31:14,902 --> 00:31:17,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's also $59.99, the wireless headset.

475
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:20,727
[SPEAKER_13]: All it really is, it's green and the button is orange and it has a

476
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:22,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Halo 3 Master Chief

477
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:49,428
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

478
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:12,865
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a Halo Xbox, and I'm not even that big a Halo fan.

479
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:16,567
[SPEAKER_13]: I just bought it because that's when I finally decided to buy an Xbox.

480
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:18,507
[SPEAKER_13]: And it probably came with a free game, didn't it?

481
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:19,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Halo, actually.

482
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:21,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Hence the Halo Xbox.

483
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:29,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, I'm not a big fan of Halo, but I am a big fan of this game.

484
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:31,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Grand Theft Auto 4.

485
00:32:32,513 --> 00:32:35,054
[SPEAKER_14]: They're getting a new trailer coming out on June 28th.

486
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:36,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, once again, teasing us.

487
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:38,559
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

488
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you really that excited over a trailer?

489
00:33:10,303 --> 00:33:14,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, because it's just like the Transformers movie.

490
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:16,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I watch every bit of stuff I can on it.

491
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:19,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, now I'm going to start slowing down because I don't want to spoil anything.

492
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:22,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I've already spoiled too much.

493
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair enough, I suppose.

494
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:30,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, something that I guess people will care about is that Track and Field...

495
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:38,848
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to be closer to release on Xbox Live Arcade probably in, quote, the next month or two.

496
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:44,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's track and field.

497
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:49,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Not one of the best old school Konami games that exist, but...

498
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they've had some pretty good ones lately.

499
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:52,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I like Time Pilot.

500
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:53,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Russian Attack was kind of fun.

501
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,280
[SPEAKER_13]: But Track and Field was just like, you just would slam the button.

502
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,480
[SPEAKER_08]: It's make my thumbs hurt the game.

503
00:33:58,141 --> 00:34:02,403
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's like all those old school Mario Party games where you just hit the button over and over and over again.

504
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,444
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all Track and Field was.

505
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:05,985
[SPEAKER_13]: One auto-fire controller will fix that.

506
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:07,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell yeah.

507
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,768
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we had the turbo button on the TurboGrafx.

508
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:12,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

509
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:14,410
[SPEAKER_14]: I needed to find one of those.

510
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:16,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Easy Achievement Points.

511
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:17,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell yeah.

512
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe there'll be something to kind of get around the auto-fire or something.

513
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,305
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd think they'd put something into place, but we'll see, I guess.

514
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:24,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they won't?

515
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:25,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on!

516
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,069
[SPEAKER_14]: These people are lazy when it comes to making these games.

517
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:29,470
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just pouring it straight over.

518
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:31,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that'll be a title that comes out.

519
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:34,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know how some weeks they've been doing two games a week lately?

520
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:38,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe that'll be kind of the B-side for the week will be track and field.

521
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:48,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, Halo 2 and Shadowrun, of course, both recently came out in the new Games for Windows collection that's Vista only, or is it?

522
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:56,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Falling Leaf Studios has actually gone to extents to make the games XP compatible.

523
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:57,279
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

524
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:24,010
[SPEAKER_13]: that says, first, Microsoft claimed that it was impossible to implement DirectX 10 compatibility atop Windows XP.

525
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:29,974
[SPEAKER_13]: And now they also want us to believe that they couldn't successfully launch two DirectX 9-based titles on XP either.

526
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:34,277
[SPEAKER_13]: We plan to expose both theories as patently false.

527
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:40,060
[SPEAKER_13]: But now they haven't really, you know, they haven't showed this to be true yet.

528
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,801
[SPEAKER_13]: The software doesn't already exist.

529
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:45,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Supposedly, this is going to come out within a few months.

530
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,202
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall see if they can expose that to work.

531
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:52,203
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a huge scam.

532
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:53,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it a scam?

533
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,285
[SPEAKER_13]: You're still getting the game for the regular price.

534
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:58,146
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just that they got a cut of it from Amazon.

535
00:35:58,367 --> 00:35:58,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

536
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:00,308
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

537
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:03,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Bandit in chat is very adamant here.

538
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,150
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, it's a fake.

539
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,011
[SPEAKER_13]: He's 19 and is lying.

540
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,912
[SPEAKER_13]: He makes 10% on that shiznit.

541
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:09,913
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

542
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,133
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really nothing they can do about it.

543
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:13,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody complained to Amazon, maybe.

544
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:14,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

545
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Well...

546
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:21,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, our usual fucking plug for GameTap.

547
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,511
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, this is news.

548
00:36:23,651 --> 00:36:27,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Brand new, their free service that they launched, I believe, last month.

549
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:32,715
[SPEAKER_14]: They're actually now going to be expanding it, which was currently 30 games, to 40 games now.

550
00:36:32,895 --> 00:36:36,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess they've got a few more people backing it.

551
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:46,611
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've also, I guess, for the regular subscription service, they've added Psychonauts, King of Fighters 97, Golden Axe the Duel, Art of Fighting 3, and Metal Slug 3.

552
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Golden Axe the Duel.

553
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's pretty awesome that Psychonauts is on there.

554
00:36:50,412 --> 00:36:53,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are some pretty awesome games they put on there for free.

555
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:54,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I love Golden Axe.

556
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:58,174
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like the first Genesis one.

557
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,714
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me miss the arcade.

558
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:03,575
[SPEAKER_08]: The Duel was actually one of the first Saturn games I ever played.

559
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:06,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep forgetting you have a Saturn.

560
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,692
[SPEAKER_08]: When I lived in Alabama, my friend wanted a Saturn so badly he imported it.

561
00:37:11,073 --> 00:37:12,915
[SPEAKER_08]: He was the world's biggest Sega fanboy.

562
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:13,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So he imported a Saturn.

563
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:16,779
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first games I got to play was King of Fighters 95.

564
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I learned the Ram Cart Switch.

565
00:37:20,624 --> 00:37:23,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And Golden Axe the Duel and some Gundam game that was okay.

566
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:27,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft in our chatroom is getting very excited.

567
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,907
[SPEAKER_13]: King of Fighters 97 for free.

568
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:30,788
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's for paid accounts.

569
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, only the paid accounts?

570
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:34,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are your games for the paid accounts.

571
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:36,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Although it may cycle through into the free games.

572
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:37,950
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know.

573
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,711
[SPEAKER_14]: There's 40 games to choose from right now for free.

574
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:41,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

575
00:37:42,031 --> 00:37:45,552
[SPEAKER_13]: That would suck though if you were getting really attached to a title and then they pull the plug on it.

576
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:47,613
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess that's how they make their money.

577
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,514
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not in business to just give things away.

578
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:50,114
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's true.

579
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:50,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Well,

580
00:37:54,938 --> 00:38:04,664
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that I think our Second Life friends will enjoy, another thing to keep you ingrained in unreality, is that they are adding voice.

581
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:15,771
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually, from what I understand, it's at Warhead, one of the places in Second Life.

582
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:18,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't play Second Life, so I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.

583
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Me neither.

584
00:38:20,034 --> 00:38:21,095
[SPEAKER_08]: You are greeted by...

585
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:50,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Dancing and Flying Sperm and Gunfire That sounds like Second Life This is even better than the Flying Cocks That is something that they should turn into a TV show Second Life TV show But apparently now that's not happening anymore because they have voice chat So people, you can download a special version of the client and in certain places, and one of the places is Waterhead you can hang out and just chat with people

586
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:52,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, you know what I can do?

587
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:56,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I can pick up my phone and call people and chat with them if I wanted to fucking talk to people.

588
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:58,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm online for a reason.

589
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:02,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Drew Nami in chat says, it's about fucking time, Second Life.

590
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:05,439
[SPEAKER_13]: There has had voice for fucking ever.

591
00:39:06,499 --> 00:39:11,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there is like a competing type of thing that has had voice chat for a while.

592
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:12,741
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard of there before.

593
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:14,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember DDR Angel when she was coming on this program?

594
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:15,862
[SPEAKER_13]: She was really into there.

595
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that game she was really into.

596
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:18,723
[SPEAKER_13]: So, huh.

597
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:24,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I did find the Final Fantasy 7 thing that they made in Second Life.

598
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,914
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty cool.

599
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:35,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I've always wanted to check out Second Life, but I always go back to World of Warcraft because I have no First Life.

600
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:38,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, oh my god, this sucks, and then deleted it.

601
00:39:39,102 --> 00:39:44,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm afraid that with Second Life, it would be like me and The Sims, where no good can come of this.

602
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:48,569
[SPEAKER_13]: We should start, can't you start a little OLR club or something?

603
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:49,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to do that.

604
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:55,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I just want, there used to be like a little all games room, but then somebody stopped paying rent on it or whatever, so it got imploded.

605
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I remember somebody sent us a picture of our little OLR logo somewhere in Second Life, and I was like, oh, that's kind of neat.

606
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:03,552
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

607
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:06,153
[SPEAKER_13]: So much for Second Life.

608
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:11,139
[SPEAKER_13]: While I was bored during my first life, I was surfing on Dig.

609
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,982
[SPEAKER_13]: And this story was dug, which I thought was interesting.

610
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:16,484
[SPEAKER_13]: It's from the website TooOldToPlay.com.

611
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:21,428
[SPEAKER_13]: And the topic is about, it says, childhood gaming, what games would you like remade?

612
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:28,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And it just basically goes on to say, hey, you know, we remember these games from when we were older, from the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Genesis, and 3DO.

613
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently this author remembers the 3DO.

614
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:32,598
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not remember the 3DO.

615
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:37,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Shadowgate 2, WWF Wrestling Arcade Game 3, River City Ransom 4, Maniac Mansion 5, Akari Warriors 15

616
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Just talking about how we would like to see these kind of redesigned.

617
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Maniac Mansion has a sequel.

618
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:09,951
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it did, but all these series kind of died a long time ago.

619
00:41:11,751 --> 00:41:12,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

620
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:16,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And he says he remembers Zelda, but he can't really say Zelda because Zelda's not really dead.

621
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,533
[SPEAKER_13]: He's talking about these series are all kind of dead.

622
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Ross Steel UT in chat says Crystallis.

623
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:24,754
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good pick.

624
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:26,154
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good game.

625
00:41:26,345 --> 00:41:28,587
[SPEAKER_13]: I also like from this list 11 RC Pro-Am.

626
00:41:28,888 --> 00:41:31,310
[SPEAKER_13]: You know I can't get through this segment without saying Guardian Legend.

627
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:32,432
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a must.

628
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:35,295
[SPEAKER_13]: What other old school game?

629
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:36,416
[SPEAKER_13]: How about StarTropics?

630
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:37,978
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell ever happened to StarTropics?

631
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,240
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm surprised it hasn't made it to Virtual Console yet.

632
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,465
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm surprised too, and I'm surprised that the... What was the kid's name in StarTropics?

633
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:48,249
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a perfect character for Smash Bros.,

634
00:41:49,198 --> 00:41:49,578
[SPEAKER_13]: at some point.

635
00:41:50,078 --> 00:41:51,439
[SPEAKER_13]: God, why can't I remember the kid's name?

636
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:56,000
[SPEAKER_14]: The only bad thing, though, about that is going to be the fact that you have to dip that manual in water.

637
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was Mikey or Mike or something.

638
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Mikey, I think, was Goonies, too.

639
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:02,181
[SPEAKER_08]: He had a really generic name.

640
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:05,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was Zeb or Zeke or something that was a bad guy.

641
00:42:05,602 --> 00:42:06,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

642
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:08,963
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

643
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:12,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, so we talked a little bit about MAME earlier.

644
00:42:13,724 --> 00:42:16,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, one of the boards for...

645
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:18,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

646
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:50,800
[SPEAKER_13]: It was no Street Fighter 2 or... I never really got into Street Fighter 3.

647
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe I'm not giving you enough credit, but I didn't care for it.

648
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:54,242
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't Street Fighter Alpha.

649
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:56,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I had my one moment of glory in Street Fighter 3.

650
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I had a moment.

651
00:42:58,866 --> 00:43:01,027
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I played it a lot, but I had my moment of glory.

652
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:04,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Street Fighter 3 and I went out on a date, but we just didn't get along.

653
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,512
[SPEAKER_13]: And it wouldn't put out, so I had to say goodbye.

654
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:10,774
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

655
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:17,359
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess that's cool for all you folks that like to pirate tons and tons of arcade games and play them on MAME.

656
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:20,239
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great news for you guys, so congratulations.

657
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:31,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's an interesting thing that's being advertised for GameStop.com is a Wii Blaster available June 27th.

658
00:43:32,263 --> 00:43:34,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Like pew pew pew lasers, I guess.

659
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:36,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

660
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:42,344
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's on one of their flyers that it will be available, like I said, on the 27th.

661
00:43:43,444 --> 00:43:50,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess to go out with... What game's coming out on Wii that's going to require a gun, maybe?

662
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:52,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's Chicken Shoot.

663
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yay!

664
00:43:54,428 --> 00:43:55,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Chicken Shoot!

665
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:59,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I guess you may be able to use it for maybe Resident Evil 4.

666
00:43:59,410 --> 00:43:59,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

667
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:08,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, later on, back when we get into the Fall Umbrella Chronicles and Ghost Squad, I don't know.

668
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:09,242
[SPEAKER_08]: But why do we need this yet?

669
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:11,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe Duck Hunt on Virtual Console.

670
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Duck Hunt!

671
00:44:13,064 --> 00:44:16,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Or better yet, this is just a piece of useless crap that they're trying to push on you.

672
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:22,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Or how about this, better yet, why don't Nintendo do what Nintendo does best and hold out on the good stuff?

673
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:27,251
[SPEAKER_13]: So instead of giving us Duck Hunt, why don't you give us Wild Gunman?

674
00:44:28,452 --> 00:44:53,515
[SPEAKER_13]: which if you've ever played Wild Gunman maybe we'll get Blastress there was seriously nothing to Wild Gunman it was who can pull the trigger faster when the thing says go Wild Gunman, they made an entire video game and sold this for a lot of money an entire game out of who can push the button first was the game so you'll probably see that on Virtual Console and then you'll get such brilliant classics like Hogan's Alley

675
00:44:54,998 --> 00:44:58,481
[SPEAKER_13]: And only then will Nintendo finally deliver the duck hunt.

676
00:45:16,207 --> 00:45:19,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Not quite as orange as the other one, but accomplishes the same thing, basically.

677
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:25,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Puts your Wii nunchuck kind of in the pistol grip area, and then, you know, the remote on top.

678
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:28,733
[SPEAKER_14]: To be honest, both of these are completely useless.

679
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:33,635
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the Wii kind of shotgun thing that you saw at E3.

680
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:36,136
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something completely different.

681
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,117
[SPEAKER_14]: It does not enhance your gameplay at all.

682
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:43,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Frisbee in chat reminds us about something related to Wild Gunman.

683
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:46,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Frisbee says, Wild Gunman was good on WarioWare Game Boy Advance.

684
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:48,587
[SPEAKER_13]: I totally forgot that it was in that game.

685
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:51,247
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, there was many references to Wild Gunman in there.

686
00:45:52,448 --> 00:45:52,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

687
00:45:53,468 --> 00:45:53,728
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

688
00:45:53,748 --> 00:45:55,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this a peripheral you're interested in getting, Jamie?

689
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:57,249
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you like to collect everything related to games.

690
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:58,970
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I thought.

691
00:45:59,010 --> 00:45:59,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.

692
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,865
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

693
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,220
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

694
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because people are dumb and will buy it.

695
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:56,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

696
00:46:56,806 --> 00:47:00,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, dude, remember the consumer market?

697
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:01,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid.

698
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Make stuff stupid people will want.

699
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:13,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe having one of these plastic things shaped like a tennis racket will help you win the first organized Wii tennis tournament that any of us know of.

700
00:47:13,738 --> 00:47:15,179
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Wimbledon.

701
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Get it?

702
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:16,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of Wimbledon.

703
00:47:16,821 --> 00:47:17,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Ha!

704
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:18,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Wimbledon!

705
00:47:19,366 --> 00:47:23,391
[SPEAKER_13]: It's being held June 23rd at Barcade, which is in Brooklyn.

706
00:47:23,451 --> 00:47:24,232
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just there.

707
00:47:24,512 --> 00:47:25,533
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty awesome.

708
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:26,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Barcade's pretty cool.

709
00:47:27,535 --> 00:47:29,117
[SPEAKER_13]: God damn it, I should have gone to Barcade.

710
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:30,398
[SPEAKER_13]: I knew of that place.

711
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:32,000
[SPEAKER_13]: I knew it was in Brooklyn.

712
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:35,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I was fucking in Brooklyn just a week ago, and I didn't even think to go to this place.

713
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:36,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh well.

714
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:39,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's a quote from the official site for Wimbledon.

715
00:47:40,373 --> 00:47:48,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Wimbledon is a Wii Tennis tournament being held on June 23rd, that's next Saturday, from noon until 5pm at Barcade in Brooklyn, specifically Williamsburg.

716
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:52,659
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be singles and doubles tournaments, prizes, and beer!

717
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe even some strawberries and cream.

718
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and cucumber sandwiches.

719
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:58,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

720
00:47:58,702 --> 00:48:00,723
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's a joke about Wimbledon that I don't get.

721
00:48:01,363 --> 00:48:01,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

722
00:48:02,924 --> 00:48:07,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't watch tennis on TV or anything, but I like Wii Tennis.

723
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:08,087
[SPEAKER_13]: It's kind of fun.

724
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:09,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

725
00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:11,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's not real tennis, but there you go.

726
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:14,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just thinking, you know, those plastic attachments for the Wii and stuff.

727
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,442
[SPEAKER_14]: You know people have trouble as it is holding on to the Wiimote.

728
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:22,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you imagine that with a chunk of plastic flying towards your TV?

729
00:48:22,684 --> 00:48:24,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Talk about some serious damage right there.

730
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:27,146
[SPEAKER_14]: So, wow.

731
00:48:28,047 --> 00:48:28,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Anywho.

732
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:31,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, so yeah, you want to get scared?

733
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:33,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here's your chance.

734
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, WifeSwap is looking for gamers to be on their show.

735
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:39,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, like the TV show?

736
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, like the TV show.

737
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Wasn't that the one that had, like, my favorite lady ever?

738
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:46,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the god warrior.

739
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,629
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking love her.

740
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:48,729
[SPEAKER_13]: She's the best thing ever.

741
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:57,755
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, yeah, so apparently you can, or possibly if you're picked, um, you and another family will swap wives and...

742
00:48:58,386 --> 00:49:00,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you imagine if Jamie went on this program?

743
00:49:00,668 --> 00:49:01,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I want no money!

744
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,602
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

745
00:49:57,088 --> 00:49:59,249
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Loki would be a good candidate for this show, too.

746
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:04,271
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't plan on breeding, so... I thought you were going to have a kid named Error.

747
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:05,151
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

748
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:21,436
[SPEAKER_14]: If you are interested and you qualify, you have a child that's six years or older, if you're interested, you want to email jodyfriedman at rdfusa.com You know, just send her a letter to say hello.

749
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:25,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you send her an email and say, hi, what's up, babe?

750
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:31,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Or just go to abc.go.com slash primetime slash wife swap.

751
00:50:32,645 --> 00:50:34,506
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope one of our listeners gets to do this.

752
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:35,707
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be far too exciting for me.

753
00:50:35,727 --> 00:50:36,747
[SPEAKER_08]: You should borrow a kid.

754
00:50:37,388 --> 00:50:38,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish I could.

755
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:41,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Ranma says that was actually trading spouses.

756
00:50:42,071 --> 00:50:45,413
[SPEAKER_13]: The Fox version of the show was the God Warrior Lady.

757
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:47,554
[SPEAKER_13]: The clip that I played was trading spouses.

758
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:51,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Wife swap is the ABC version of the same fucking show.

759
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:51,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

760
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:52,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

761
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:54,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Nanny and Nanny 911.

762
00:50:55,513 --> 00:50:57,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Same fucking show, two different networks.

763
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,434
[SPEAKER_08]: You should rent a child.

764
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:03,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you could borrow a child for like two weeks.

765
00:51:04,636 --> 00:51:06,417
[SPEAKER_13]: I might see if a co-worker has one you can borrow.

766
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:06,977
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

767
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Besides, I'd get some crazy bitches in my house throwing my shit away.

768
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need anyone to be doing that shit.

769
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, no, that's right, I would be there, so I would be able to monitor where she throws shit away.

770
00:51:22,907 --> 00:51:24,149
[SPEAKER_14]: No more playing games!

771
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:26,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Fine, I can do that, you stupid whore!

772
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,031
[SPEAKER_13]: You know they're going to get some World of Warcraft addict on the show.

773
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:35,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you get some smart-ass kid that, you know, obviously, it's not your kid or whatever.

774
00:51:35,312 --> 00:51:37,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's my eight-year-old child.

775
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:43,776
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to get some fucking World of Warcraft addict who's going to start twitching the minute they're missing a Tuesday night raid.

776
00:51:44,137 --> 00:51:47,198
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to start going into, like, and they're going to put him in, like, an Amish house.

777
00:51:47,578 --> 00:51:50,440
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's going to go, oh, actually, no, wait, it's wife swap, huh?

778
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,541
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to put him, yeah, he's just going to stay there.

779
00:51:53,561 --> 00:51:55,402
[SPEAKER_08]: They should get a wife that's more addicted than him.

780
00:51:55,482 --> 00:51:57,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they should get a, well, or whatever, whatever.

781
00:51:57,901 --> 00:52:05,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Nevermind, I guess it's not Husband Swap I'm just going to shut up and let the callers do the doing now Be funny!

782
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:21,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Please be more funny than I am If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR That show they should let you sleep with the new wife Unless she's ugly, in which case you wouldn't want to touch that shit You're horrible 1-877-GAME-OLR Let's go to the phones, or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

783
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:27,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Woot, it's Nintendo Maniac 64 Hello Nintendo Maniac 64, what's on your mind?

784
00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:33,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, uh, oh, right now, I just gotta ask one little random question.

785
00:52:34,328 --> 00:52:41,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know of anyone who actually doesn't use Windows XP or Vista other than, like, Mac and Linux and stuff?

786
00:52:42,691 --> 00:52:44,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, who uses something older?

787
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:49,574
[SPEAKER_11]: People use any... Well, I mean, like, someone like me who's, like, a diehard Windows 2K addict.

788
00:52:52,404 --> 00:53:18,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I know people who use Palm OS I know people who still are on Windows 98 because they just don't feel like upgrading because all they use is the internet I know people who are still on Windows 3.11 My dad uses Windows ME and I have no idea why but he does I have a computer downstairs that still works with 3.11 in fact the PC I'm on right now is 98 Out of curiosity, why do you ask?

789
00:53:20,137 --> 00:53:27,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to have my computer replaced because my husband decided he was going to be nice and upgrade my computer from Windows 2000 to XP.

790
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,882
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not upgrading.

791
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:50,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, he thought that he was upgrading.

792
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:53,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And it turned out that it completely fucked over my system.

793
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:56,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I ended up having to have it anyway because I bought a VAIO.

794
00:53:56,928 --> 00:54:02,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Now my VAIO is starting to die and I'm just so sad about the day that I have to get a new computer with Vista on it.

795
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:04,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have to ask another question.

796
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:05,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

797
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,551
[SPEAKER_11]: It was in the first part of the show, maybe it was like late second.

798
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:15,173
[SPEAKER_11]: When you guys started talking about it was something, like there was a bunch of anime coming to something and then Loki started going...

799
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:17,398
[SPEAKER_11]: raving about how awesome Akira was.

800
00:54:17,498 --> 00:54:19,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, what's the anime for?

801
00:54:19,919 --> 00:54:21,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it coming to something?

802
00:54:21,419 --> 00:54:23,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Xbox Live Arcade, their movie series.

803
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:25,580
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Xbox Live Video Marketplace.

804
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Same fucking thing.

805
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,260
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xbox Live thing.

806
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's actually already there right now.

807
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:35,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and third off, okay, I gotta have a mini rant.

808
00:54:36,101 --> 00:54:38,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, make it quick.

809
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:40,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it at a friend's house.

810
00:54:41,262 --> 00:54:43,203
[SPEAKER_11]: They had the custom controls.

811
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:45,403
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like hacked

812
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:50,960
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't map the weapon cycle to X or O. What the crap?

813
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:56,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can't map it so that you can have turning and moving forward and back on the same analog stick.

814
00:54:57,081 --> 00:55:01,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Since I grew up in Goldeneye and stuff, that was the default control scheme and it's drilled in my head.

815
00:55:01,462 --> 00:55:02,302
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta use that.

816
00:55:02,702 --> 00:55:06,103
[SPEAKER_11]: And they won't even let me change the individual axes.

817
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, what the heck?

818
00:55:07,463 --> 00:55:12,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Boo in general to games that don't let you change the button configuration to whatever you like, no matter what it is.

819
00:55:13,447 --> 00:55:23,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the thing is, it did let me change the buttons themselves, except that it wouldn't let me put Weapon Cycle onto X or O. That's strange.

820
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't played Resistance.

821
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,331
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys have played it more than I have.

822
00:55:27,431 --> 00:55:36,473
[SPEAKER_14]: There's only one button for Weapon Cycle, and it's, I think, because... Well, all the buttons are analog, I guess, but for whatever reason...

823
00:55:37,526 --> 00:55:44,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, it's the R2 button, it's the one you do for weapons, so you either tap it, then it'll switch to the next one, or you hold it down and it'll allow you to switch which one you want.

824
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:50,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I love the, it seemed pretty straightforward to me, I just kept it on the default stuff, so.

825
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:57,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it on the X or the O, kind of like where it'd be like on the A button, like the GameCube or the N64, like Goldeneye for example.

826
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:19,286
[SPEAKER_13]: I suppose it's similar to like when I go, well, a couple years ago when I would go back and forth between Phantasy Star and Final Fantasy XI, they had the camera on completely different axes so that like when I went up and down and stuff, it would like totally mess with my head because it was all messed up.

827
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:25,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac 64, thanks so much for the call and I hope you can get used to the controls in the game.

828
00:56:26,195 --> 00:56:26,675
[SPEAKER_13]: The way they are.

829
00:56:27,056 --> 00:56:27,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

830
00:56:27,556 --> 00:56:30,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't have a PS3, so that's perfectly fine.

831
00:56:30,237 --> 00:56:32,118
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more incentive for me not to get one.

832
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:32,639
[SPEAKER_13]: You got it.

833
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:33,399
[SPEAKER_13]: So never mind, then.

834
00:56:33,479 --> 00:56:33,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Have fun.

835
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,360
[SPEAKER_13]: True, Sony.

836
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

837
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

838
00:56:37,281 --> 00:56:37,581
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

839
00:56:38,142 --> 00:56:45,926
[SPEAKER_13]: If you would like to give us a call, it's Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

840
00:56:46,006 --> 00:56:46,767
[SPEAKER_13]: More phone calls.

841
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:48,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

842
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:48,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

843
00:56:49,648 --> 00:56:50,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Raven Stolfen.

844
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:51,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hello, Raven Stolfen.

845
00:56:51,889 --> 00:56:52,750
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind, my friend?

846
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:54,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you sound analog?

847
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:56,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate Skype 2.5.

848
00:56:56,811 --> 00:56:59,072
[SPEAKER_10]: You sound like you're on, like, an old-fashioned phone.

849
00:56:59,352 --> 00:56:59,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

850
00:57:00,232 --> 00:57:02,273
[SPEAKER_13]: You kind of sound a little weird, too, but whatever.

851
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:03,034
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll just have to deal.

852
00:57:03,054 --> 00:57:03,534
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

853
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,435
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the 2.5 thing.

854
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

855
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:06,995
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all right.

856
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:08,656
[SPEAKER_13]: At least you're not breaking up or whatever.

857
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:09,136
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

858
00:57:09,977 --> 00:57:11,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's much clearer, but that sucks.

859
00:57:11,558 --> 00:57:13,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry for going on that little rant.

860
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:14,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Mortal Kombat for Wii.

861
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I was so tempted to buy this the other day, but I didn't.

862
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:18,481
[SPEAKER_13]: What about it?

863
00:57:19,628 --> 00:57:23,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I played it, and I got to tell you something, it's a good Mortal Kombat game.

864
00:57:24,172 --> 00:57:28,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually surprised that they did the Wii mode thing very well.

865
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:30,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it easy to control?

866
00:57:30,437 --> 00:57:31,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's the thing that holds me back.

867
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:32,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

868
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:34,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell yeah.

869
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:34,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

870
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It's super easy.

871
00:57:36,742 --> 00:57:38,103
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't look... You want to hear how easy?

872
00:57:38,223 --> 00:57:40,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

873
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:48,592
[SPEAKER_10]: You press down the B button, and you move it like a half moon, up and down, left and right, and you do the scorpion get over here real easy.

874
00:57:49,994 --> 00:57:52,136
[SPEAKER_10]: and Fatalities are just super easy.

875
00:57:52,376 --> 00:57:54,539
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I do with Fatalities?

876
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:56,941
[SPEAKER_13]: You just hold the button and swing it all around, see what happens?

877
00:57:58,122 --> 00:57:58,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

878
00:57:58,923 --> 00:58:05,750
[SPEAKER_10]: You swing it, it's kind of like you swing it and then you press the little directional pad and it will do a Fatality.

879
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:06,991
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how easy it is.

880
00:58:08,973 --> 00:58:09,814
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds pretty fun.

881
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:11,176
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you move the guy around the screen?

882
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,537
[SPEAKER_13]: You just use the control pad on the Wiimote?

883
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:14,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I just rant about the new Skype one?

884
00:58:14,854 --> 00:58:15,655
[SPEAKER_13]: The new Skype?

885
00:58:15,675 --> 00:58:19,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, 2.5, it has this really annoying ring thing, and it gets in your ear, and it's like, is this a new ring?

886
00:58:19,255 --> 00:58:19,755
[SPEAKER_13]: This sucks.

887
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's just my voice that you're hearing.

888
00:58:43,115 --> 00:58:44,237
[SPEAKER_13]: That has nothing to do with Skype.

889
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:46,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to games.

890
00:58:46,342 --> 00:58:46,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to games.

891
00:58:47,084 --> 00:58:47,585
[SPEAKER_13]: One more thing.

892
00:58:48,632 --> 00:58:50,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, one more thing.

893
00:58:50,213 --> 00:58:51,234
[SPEAKER_13]: You got a black DS.

894
00:58:51,754 --> 00:58:53,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I sure did, a black DS Lite.

895
00:58:53,395 --> 00:59:00,379
[SPEAKER_13]: I was so close to getting the pink one, but then I decided that next time I go to New York, hopefully the engraving machine will be working and I can get it engraved.

896
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:04,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And engravings show up much better on the black DS than it does on any of the other colors.

897
00:59:04,702 --> 00:59:06,363
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the end, I went for the black DS.

898
00:59:06,803 --> 00:59:12,566
[SPEAKER_13]: What I do want to get, though, is I'm going to get the little pink case with the sparkling little bling on it.

899
00:59:12,606 --> 00:59:16,689
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm going to get to have my Princess Peach homage.

900
00:59:17,642 --> 00:59:18,643
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so happy for you.

901
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,544
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a black one, too, and I love it.

902
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and I actually hear the black ones are usually bigger.

903
00:59:26,387 --> 00:59:26,827
[SPEAKER_13]: So I hear.

904
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:28,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, all right, but that's just a rumor.

905
00:59:29,008 --> 00:59:32,550
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, anything else you want to add, Raven Stolven?

906
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:33,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't download 2.5.

907
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:35,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucks.

908
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:36,012
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, I won't.

909
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,612
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll hold that on the current Skype I have.

910
00:59:38,073 --> 00:59:38,933
[SPEAKER_13]: See you later, Raven Stolven.

911
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:39,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

912
00:59:40,274 --> 00:59:43,836
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd like to give us a call, the username is orangeentredo on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

913
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:49,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

914
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

915
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,641
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who it is.

916
00:59:52,781 --> 00:59:53,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Static Man!

917
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Jesus Christ.

918
00:59:55,582 --> 01:00:01,104
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like... Do you, like, put this on auto-dial or something, and then when we finally pick up, you, like, jump for the microphone?

919
01:00:01,144 --> 01:00:02,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, oh, shit.

920
01:00:03,205 --> 01:00:04,806
[SPEAKER_05]: I just use brute force.

921
01:00:04,926 --> 01:00:06,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, like, you know, hammer the line.

922
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:07,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guilty of that.

923
01:00:08,207 --> 01:00:08,948
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all right.

924
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:11,009
[SPEAKER_13]: It was good to see you this weekend, Zaku, by the way.

925
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:11,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for coming out.

926
01:00:12,887 --> 01:00:16,250
[SPEAKER_13]: You missed our trip to Astor Place in the video game store.

927
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:17,270
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we did after you left.

928
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:17,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

929
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:18,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to play the store.

930
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:22,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It just came out that weekend.

931
01:00:22,814 --> 01:00:23,515
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all good, buddy.

932
01:00:23,535 --> 01:00:25,276
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

933
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:26,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see.

934
01:00:26,076 --> 01:00:34,923
[SPEAKER_05]: You already know that Rockstar is basically shifting more to the Microsoft side now that they've confirmed exclusive stuff for Grand Theft Auto 4.

935
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:39,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically dispelling any chances of it showing up on the PS3 at all.

936
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:59,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've heard... And they had the gall to say that the PS3 version would move consoles, which is just a load of bullshit, because if there's nothing beyond the regular game that the PS3 folks can attain, then what's the point of actually playing it?

937
01:00:59,941 --> 01:01:01,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, actually, this is Grand Theft Auto 4.

938
01:01:01,963 --> 01:01:02,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

939
01:01:03,962 --> 01:01:06,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockstar confirmed it in their shareholders meeting.

940
01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:10,605
[SPEAKER_14]: It will move consoles because, oh wait, they don't have the episodic content either.

941
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:11,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there we go.

942
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:12,926
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly it.

943
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:15,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft paid a good $50 million to keep it on their side.

944
01:01:15,888 --> 01:01:19,370
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it will just move consoles both for 360 and PS3.

945
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:25,012
[SPEAKER_05]: How could you move consoles when one side doesn't have anything beyond the gameplay?

946
01:01:26,133 --> 01:01:28,014
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm trying to get across to you.

947
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,025
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

948
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:55,996
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll actually rumble the console when the game's played, you know?

949
01:01:56,396 --> 01:02:00,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that has yet to be seen, but the bottom line is this.

950
01:02:00,796 --> 01:02:05,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockstar is basically leaning towards the side of, you know, it's basically the carrot and the stick.

951
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:09,818
[SPEAKER_05]: The carrot, you know, the stick being Microsoft, the carrot being the money.

952
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:15,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're looking at the numbers right now, and they're trying to get to, you know... What's this about a stick and a carrot?

953
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:20,940
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems the 360 is something that, you know, they'll make a lot more money than...

954
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,248
[SPEAKER_05]: and the PS3.

955
01:02:24,029 --> 01:02:25,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's the way it goes.

956
01:02:27,191 --> 01:02:27,792
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess so.

957
01:02:27,872 --> 01:02:28,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's the way it goes.

958
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:30,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I just heard stick and a carrot.

959
01:02:32,035 --> 01:02:39,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, because Microsoft being the stick and then the carrot being the money.

960
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:45,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, DarkSakura, what do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?

961
01:02:47,145 --> 01:02:48,066
[SPEAKER_14]: My ass!

962
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:49,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

963
01:02:50,248 --> 01:02:50,488
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

964
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:51,578
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

965
01:02:51,618 --> 01:02:53,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference.

966
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen Kung Pao.

967
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,001
[SPEAKER_13]: You are a loser.

968
01:02:55,061 --> 01:02:56,082
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, sorry, Zaku.

969
01:02:56,102 --> 01:02:58,244
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry I couldn't keep everybody on topic.

970
01:02:58,304 --> 01:03:03,528
[SPEAKER_13]: But granted, I don't want to debate the Sony-Microsoft thing anymore.

971
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:06,670
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to look at the writing on the wall.

972
01:03:07,491 --> 01:03:12,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockstar is basically going to have to start leaning towards one side over another.

973
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:24,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless of what's already been done in the past, and by extending the game beyond the disc... It's just a crazy cycle.

974
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:30,422
[SPEAKER_13]: The companies are going to release the game on the console that has the most number of machines in the market.

975
01:03:30,662 --> 01:03:35,323
[SPEAKER_13]: But the console that's going to have the most number of machines in the market is going to be the one that has the good games on it.

976
01:03:35,363 --> 01:03:37,443
[SPEAKER_13]: So it all comes down to first-party games.

977
01:03:38,044 --> 01:03:39,484
[SPEAKER_13]: It all comes down to the first-party games.

978
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:40,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

979
01:03:40,848 --> 01:03:44,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockstar knows that the 360 has a bigger install base than the PS3.

980
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:48,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted that the 360 had a one year head start.

981
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:52,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they didn't blow, they didn't take it for granted.

982
01:03:53,432 --> 01:04:02,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, this is going, you know, it's just that they're saying, you know, Rockstar is just bullshitting when they're saying that their version, their PS3 version of GTA 4 is actually going to move consoles.

983
01:04:03,616 --> 01:04:04,736
[SPEAKER_13]: We shall see what happens.

984
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:07,197
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it doesn't make sense.

985
01:04:07,837 --> 01:04:08,077
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

986
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:09,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you very much for the call, Zaku.

987
01:04:09,774 --> 01:04:10,714
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to get some more calls.

988
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:11,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

989
01:04:12,195 --> 01:04:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

990
01:04:12,835 --> 01:04:14,036
[SPEAKER_13]: See you.

991
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:17,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

992
01:04:17,598 --> 01:04:18,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Some comments from chat room.

993
01:04:18,678 --> 01:04:23,681
[SPEAKER_13]: GS191 says, Shit, at the end of the day, Take-Two Interactive is going to make a shit ton of money anyway.

994
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:26,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Note, buy their stock before Grand Theft Auto 4 release.

995
01:04:27,303 --> 01:04:29,544
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope the game tanks, just to piss you all off.

996
01:04:29,904 --> 01:04:30,865
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care if it tanks.

997
01:04:30,925 --> 01:04:32,206
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't give a shit about their stock.

998
01:04:32,246 --> 01:04:33,326
[SPEAKER_13]: The game's going to be awesome.

999
01:04:33,346 --> 01:04:34,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1000
01:04:34,307 --> 01:04:34,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1001
01:04:35,307 --> 01:04:36,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, this is Dr. Gnar.

1002
01:04:37,149 --> 01:04:38,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Dr. Gnar.

1003
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:39,030
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

1004
01:04:39,831 --> 01:04:45,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to prove to all the other guys listening that you can actually get a coin if you try hard enough.

1005
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:46,376
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

1006
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:48,498
[SPEAKER_13]: You just got to keep hammering the line and you can get in.

1007
01:04:48,538 --> 01:04:49,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm glad you got it.

1008
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you called our show before?

1009
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've never.

1010
01:04:54,502 --> 01:04:59,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought this is my second show listening live from Mexico City.

1011
01:05:00,148 --> 01:05:02,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome, we like the worldly listeners, that's always fun.

1012
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:05,292
[SPEAKER_13]: How's things going in Mexico City?

1013
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:07,813
[SPEAKER_13]: How's the gaming scene in a place like Mexico City?

1014
01:05:08,754 --> 01:05:13,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's pretty much like Southern California, where I've been a ton of times.

1015
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:21,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty much all you have to do is get a lot of games, and there's really not that many people playing live.

1016
01:05:22,103 --> 01:05:26,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to play with a bunch of guys from the US, so that's why I'm here.

1017
01:05:27,655 --> 01:05:28,096
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1018
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:31,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, hey, you meet a lot of folks here who like to play with folks around the world.

1019
01:05:31,479 --> 01:05:32,039
[SPEAKER_13]: It's good times.

1020
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,322
[SPEAKER_13]: What type of games have you been playing recently?

1021
01:05:36,943 --> 01:05:38,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, not the kind of games that I like.

1022
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:44,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I like role-playing games, but there's not that many more out there.

1023
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:47,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now I'm pretty much playing shoot-'em-ups.

1024
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:50,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadowrun's been my latest failure.

1025
01:05:50,775 --> 01:05:54,839
[SPEAKER_13]: You, like me, must be more excited about Eternal Sonata than Halo 3.

1026
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:57,285
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1027
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:17,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm married, I have a couple of kids, so it's a pretty interesting gaming scene.

1028
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:24,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, unfortunately, I don't think you could apply for the show because you're in another country, and I think that brings a whole other issue into it.

1029
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:26,333
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're saying you wouldn't trade your wife for anything?

1030
01:06:27,874 --> 01:06:35,759
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and that's already given since both my kids are starting into video games, and they're only three and five.

1031
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:38,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what kind of games are you letting the kids play?

1032
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:39,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly Wii.

1033
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:42,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I got them a Wii, and I have a bunch of games.

1034
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:50,807
[SPEAKER_04]: for kids, basically anything rated E. I have Shrek, I have Monster Sync, that kind of games.

1035
01:06:51,502 --> 01:07:03,486
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, there was this guy I ran into at Fry's the other day, and he was looking at the Wii games, and he overheard myself and I think Shane talking to each other about the different games, and he could tell that we kind of knew stuff about games.

1036
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:08,268
[SPEAKER_13]: So he actually came up and asked me, he's like, what would be a good Wii game for me to get for the family?

1037
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:10,589
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm like, well, who's playing the Wii, you or the kids?

1038
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:12,730
[SPEAKER_13]: And he said kind of something for all of us.

1039
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:15,991
[SPEAKER_13]: So I recommended Elebits and WarioWare.

1040
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:17,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that a good suggestion?

1041
01:07:17,512 --> 01:07:17,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1042
01:07:17,932 --> 01:07:18,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't think...

1043
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:23,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Zelda is the best game on the Wii, but I don't know if young kids would really get into that so much.

1044
01:07:23,976 --> 01:07:26,298
[SPEAKER_13]: So I said Elebits and WarioWare.

1045
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:28,299
[SPEAKER_14]: WarioWare is good.

1046
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:29,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Excite Truck.

1047
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:32,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1048
01:07:33,123 --> 01:07:33,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice Cities.

1049
01:07:34,463 --> 01:07:36,965
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your suggestion, right, Loki?

1050
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:39,827
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't have Vice City on the Wii.

1051
01:07:40,068 --> 01:07:40,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Get Scarface!

1052
01:07:41,288 --> 01:07:41,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Godfather!

1053
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:43,270
[SPEAKER_13]: No Scarface.

1054
01:07:43,723 --> 01:07:44,664
[SPEAKER_08]: and the Trauma Center.

1055
01:07:44,744 --> 01:07:46,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Get them started on the path to surgery early.

1056
01:07:47,065 --> 01:07:49,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I said Trauma Center is a really fun game, but I don't think kids will play it.

1057
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:52,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like watching the patients bleed because I'm no good at it.

1058
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:56,391
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, it's funny you said you wouldn't trade your wife for anything.

1059
01:07:56,451 --> 01:07:58,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't inflict my husband on anyone else.

1060
01:08:00,373 --> 01:08:00,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.

1061
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:01,854
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

1062
01:08:02,434 --> 01:08:04,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Dr. Nahr, thanks so much for calling in.

1063
01:08:04,876 --> 01:08:06,076
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate hearing from you.

1064
01:08:06,236 --> 01:08:09,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know if they celebrate it in Mexico, but Happy Father's Day nonetheless.

1065
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:10,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1066
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:10,979
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1067
01:08:11,459 --> 01:08:11,940
[SPEAKER_04]: We have it too.

1068
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:14,882
[SPEAKER_13]: See you later.

1069
01:08:14,942 --> 01:08:15,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care.

1070
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:15,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for calling.

1071
01:08:16,362 --> 01:08:16,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

1072
01:08:17,002 --> 01:08:17,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

1073
01:08:42,381 --> 01:08:43,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys, it's Insanist.

1074
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:11,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, Insanus.

1075
01:09:12,091 --> 01:09:14,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going insane just thinking about you.

1076
01:09:14,573 --> 01:09:15,314
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1077
01:09:17,075 --> 01:09:17,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

1078
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:21,639
[SPEAKER_11]: You may all notice that I sound a lot like DMN when I'm not DMN.

1079
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so very well put.

1080
01:09:25,883 --> 01:09:27,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie took a PS3 and bludgeoned him to death.

1081
01:09:28,225 --> 01:09:29,907
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a horrible funeral.

1082
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:36,412
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have officially retired or killed off DMN, and now we have Insanus instead.

1083
01:09:37,393 --> 01:09:38,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I have.

1084
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:40,655
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your prerogative.

1085
01:09:40,675 --> 01:09:43,417
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, Madonna wants everybody to call her Esther.

1086
01:09:43,717 --> 01:09:45,479
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have every right.

1087
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:47,481
[SPEAKER_13]: And Prince wanted everybody to call him by that symbol.

1088
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:50,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I've called Madonna the same thing throughout her career, and that's a whore.

1089
01:09:51,424 --> 01:09:58,690
[SPEAKER_08]: In Prince's defense, it had to do with the fact that his previous label owned the name Prince.

1090
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,893
[SPEAKER_08]: So he used the symbol in terms of protest until the contract was up and could get his thing again.

1091
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Has this show really come to discussing Prince?

1092
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:12,579
[SPEAKER_08]: He wore crocheted assless pants, and that's bravery.

1093
01:10:12,679 --> 01:10:15,581
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what it sounds like when I cry.

1094
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:19,843
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyways, Rob, you need to explain something to your listeners.

1095
01:10:20,184 --> 01:10:20,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1096
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:23,466
[SPEAKER_11]: That you're not doing Orange Lounge Radio anymore.

1097
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:29,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at this press release from CBS right here, and apparently you're the new host of The Price is Right.

1098
01:10:31,335 --> 01:10:32,456
[SPEAKER_13]: I freaking wish.

1099
01:11:01,414 --> 01:11:09,838
[SPEAKER_11]: will show perfectly for the new host of The Price is Right, and we will have somebody more feminine than Marker's Duties.

1100
01:11:11,638 --> 01:11:16,000
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what to say, Insanist, but Plinko just moves me to tears.

1101
01:11:19,302 --> 01:11:26,925
[SPEAKER_11]: No, however, I'm actually calling to raise some beef over the Church of England vs. Sony...

1102
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:34,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm just playing a little bit of the Price is Right dance remix that I have.

1103
01:11:35,415 --> 01:11:36,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, let's get into the music.

1104
01:11:43,502 --> 01:11:45,824
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I wanted to turn the Price is Right into a gay rave.

1105
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:48,726
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I was not allowed to host it, sadly.

1106
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:52,969
[SPEAKER_08]: You just wanted those sparkling jackets.

1107
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:55,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, Rod Roddy was the man.

1108
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:56,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't make fun of Rod Roddy.

1109
01:11:59,224 --> 01:12:03,387
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually going to call out the CBS executives and I'm just too fucking tired.

1110
01:12:05,549 --> 01:12:12,455
[SPEAKER_11]: But I am up in arms over the Sony versus Church of England thing and how Sony is taking the whole thing.

1111
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Initially they weren't taking it seriously at all.

1112
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:20,362
[SPEAKER_11]: They were saying, oh, we're talking to the Church of England and Church of England was like, um, no.

1113
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:23,464
[SPEAKER_13]: No one's talking to us.

1114
01:12:23,484 --> 01:12:26,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the Church of England's demands are a little bit harsh.

1115
01:12:27,113 --> 01:12:35,480
[SPEAKER_11]: They want Resistance Fall of Man to be completely removed from the shelves and for them to completely redesign the level that the Church of Manchester is in.

1116
01:12:37,801 --> 01:12:43,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't agree with that as much as I would love Sony to burn it out.

1117
01:12:47,269 --> 01:12:52,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I would... It's kind of a... It's a high demand.

1118
01:12:53,173 --> 01:12:55,135
[SPEAKER_11]: The Church of England has to understand that Sony is a business.

1119
01:12:56,096 --> 01:12:56,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1120
01:12:57,055 --> 01:12:59,557
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're saying, oh, likeness of a building, whatever.

1121
01:13:00,297 --> 01:13:03,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Last I checked, I don't think buildings have likeness rights.

1122
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:08,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and you know, isn't it kind of common to see famous landmarks in video games?

1123
01:13:08,402 --> 01:13:11,504
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, how many games are out there that involve the White House?

1124
01:13:12,024 --> 01:13:16,467
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, or like in that alien shooting game, what was it, Destroy All Humans?

1125
01:13:16,507 --> 01:13:17,988
[SPEAKER_13]: You could blow up the White House, you know?

1126
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:23,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Or how about all the movies out there that have New York City being destroyed?

1127
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:28,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, but usually, though, in a lot of those, you're getting the permits to shoot at those locations.

1128
01:13:28,451 --> 01:13:31,932
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess not always, because sometimes they shoot in Canada and make it look like the U.S.

1129
01:13:32,792 --> 01:13:33,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Certain landmarks, they do that.

1130
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:37,974
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a fictional game that takes place in a fictional future that...

1131
01:13:39,688 --> 01:13:46,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree the church has somewhat of their panties in a bunch, but it wouldn't pain Sony to go, look, sorry we pissed you off.

1132
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:48,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Our bad, but we're not going to recall the game.

1133
01:13:48,796 --> 01:13:50,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Bill, sorry that you're offended by this.

1134
01:13:50,838 --> 01:13:51,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck off.

1135
01:13:54,661 --> 01:13:57,443
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you like to see happen as a resolution, Insanist?

1136
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:07,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like to see the church of England saying, oh, well, you should donate some money to a gun control education fund, because

1137
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:12,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Those of you who aren't aware, Manchester, England had a horrible, horrible gun problem.

1138
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:18,839
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say a month and a half, two months ago, a 15-year-old kid was killed with a mistaken identity.

1139
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:19,999
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a gun crime.

1140
01:14:20,019 --> 01:14:22,000
[SPEAKER_11]: The kid got killed execution style.

1141
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,562
[SPEAKER_11]: It was not something you like reading.

1142
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:29,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, then that's very unfortunate, and that sounds like a very fair resolution as well.

1143
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:33,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony donates a little money to charity, all is well.

1144
01:14:33,447 --> 01:14:34,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Kiss and make up.

1145
01:14:35,668 --> 01:14:35,788
Yeah.

1146
01:14:38,393 --> 01:14:39,353
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it on that.

1147
01:14:40,494 --> 01:14:42,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to plug The Insanest Hour.

1148
01:14:42,735 --> 01:14:43,956
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not STFU.

1149
01:14:44,876 --> 01:14:48,658
[SPEAKER_11]: It's me making fun of stuff and swearing for an hour and playing music.

1150
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:49,979
[SPEAKER_13]: And there you go, Ashley.

1151
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,440
[SPEAKER_13]: And we should say it here on the show.

1152
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:56,462
[SPEAKER_13]: This all kind of went down while I was out of town and while the rest of the hosts were on vacation.

1153
01:14:56,882 --> 01:15:00,144
[SPEAKER_13]: But STFU finally did, unfortunately.

1154
01:15:00,644 --> 01:15:03,706
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're sad to see it go, but that's all right.

1155
01:15:04,284 --> 01:15:08,465
[SPEAKER_11]: It was over things with my employer, who, as I've been adamant, will remain nameless.

1156
01:15:08,485 --> 01:15:10,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I was actually going to come next week.

1157
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:11,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I had things come down where the checkbook said no.

1158
01:15:34,623 --> 01:15:34,863
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1159
01:15:34,943 --> 01:15:36,324
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, you know, money happens.

1160
01:15:36,684 --> 01:15:37,244
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's okay.

1161
01:15:37,284 --> 01:15:40,666
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're at a point now where we're actually going to have no guests, and that's kind of how we're going to do it.

1162
01:15:40,706 --> 01:15:41,966
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just going to be the three of us next week.

1163
01:15:42,007 --> 01:15:44,248
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'll tell you more about what's going to happen next week a little later in the show.

1164
01:15:45,528 --> 01:15:46,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, fine.

1165
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:56,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you just act like you're better than everybody and clamp yourself in your stupid orange lounge room and do your own radio show for your fifth year anniversary and not share it with anybody else?

1166
01:15:56,373 --> 01:15:57,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, you're going to hit it with the radio.

1167
01:15:58,034 --> 01:15:59,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll do that, actually.

1168
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,656
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know how else I can assert that I'm better than you, Insanist?

1169
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:04,812
[SPEAKER_11]: You're about to hang up on me?

1170
01:16:04,932 --> 01:16:05,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1171
01:16:05,692 --> 01:16:05,952
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1172
01:16:06,553 --> 01:16:11,576
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1173
01:16:11,596 --> 01:16:12,537
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do one more call.

1174
01:16:12,577 --> 01:16:13,217
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm such a dick.

1175
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:17,059
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's Insanist or DMN or whatever.

1176
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,240
[SPEAKER_13]: The symbol.

1177
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,081
[SPEAKER_13]: He should have a symbol there.

1178
01:16:20,482 --> 01:16:21,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever you want to call him.

1179
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:24,104
[SPEAKER_08]: From now on, his name is Swirly Polka Dots.

1180
01:16:24,264 --> 01:16:25,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Swirly Polka Dots.

1181
01:16:25,925 --> 01:16:27,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Sega Swirl is his new name, actually.

1182
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:28,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Sega Swirl.

1183
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,182
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not actually getting any more calls, it looks like.

1184
01:16:33,642 --> 01:16:35,584
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe that's it.

1185
01:16:35,684 --> 01:16:37,365
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a private message from Insanus.

1186
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:38,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I got a heart.

1187
01:16:38,266 --> 01:16:39,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I got less than three.

1188
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:40,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

1189
01:16:41,028 --> 01:16:43,190
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well then I guess that's it since no more calls are coming in.

1190
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,411
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go ahead and close up the Skype line.

1191
01:16:44,431 --> 01:16:45,652
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a lot of calls tonight anyway.

1192
01:16:45,672 --> 01:16:48,174
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought I saw some other numbers popping up, but they must have stopped trying.

1193
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:49,812
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's about it.

1194
01:16:49,892 --> 01:16:50,673
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to wrap things up.

1195
01:16:50,753 --> 01:16:55,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go around and first ask if there's any last minute stories.

1196
01:16:55,454 --> 01:16:57,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything last minute that wants to be brought up tonight.

1197
01:16:58,635 --> 01:16:59,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you usually have something.

1198
01:17:00,175 --> 01:17:00,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I do.

1199

[SPEAKER_14]: As well as a Clash of the Titans remake Oh lord Will they have the really bad dubbing like the first one?

[SPEAKER_13]: Going outside?

1207
01:17:48,271 --> 01:17:51,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Halo 3's viral marketing campaign has taken its place.

1209
01:18:00,394 --> 01:18:09,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's apparently this weird viral marketing campaign that they have going on, including people staying in the street with signs and websites with calendars and whatnot.

1210
01:18:10,256 --> 01:18:11,976
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want more info on that,

1211
01:18:13,178 --> 01:18:15,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are they standing in the street with signs?

1212
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,924
[SPEAKER_13]: The people that are waiting for Halo 3 are playing Gears of War while they're waiting.

1213
01:18:20,184 --> 01:18:21,105
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not outside.

1214
01:18:21,145 --> 01:18:23,547
[SPEAKER_14]: This is part of the viral marketing campaign.

1215
01:18:24,828 --> 01:18:30,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Ace Combat 6 is getting a limited edition flight stick bundle that's going to be coming out.

1217
01:18:41,809 --> 01:18:43,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt Cosimani from...

1218
01:19:05,057 --> 01:19:08,060
[SPEAKER_14]: IGN posted a while back about Halo on the DS.

1219
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:12,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, apparently in their latest podcast, they said, It's a real game.

1220
01:19:12,084 --> 01:19:17,108
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to lay down some ownage next week or soon afterwards, showing you guys that it's a real game.

1221
01:19:17,589 --> 01:19:23,074
[SPEAKER_14]: So IGN will probably have info about Halo DS soon.

1222
01:19:23,254 --> 01:19:24,595
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

1223
01:19:26,657 --> 01:19:27,598
[SPEAKER_03]: My thoughts exactly.

1224
01:19:28,839 --> 01:19:29,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Who cares?

1225
01:19:33,041 --> 01:19:46,649
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, like, they're, like, I don't know, to me, the way you read that, and I don't know if that's the way you post it or if you belch or whatever, but it sounds like they're, like, kind of just, like, they're, like, we've got a big cock because we knew that Halo was really on the DS and we're going to prove it.

1226
01:19:46,689 --> 01:19:47,449
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, who cares?

1227
01:19:48,129 --> 01:19:54,313
[SPEAKER_13]: If the game never came out, I mean, what, I'm supposed to look at, like, oh, look how this game was almost, like, completely bastardized.

1228
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:58,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, in other news, there was a video of Diablo for the Game Boy online.

1229
01:19:58,415 --> 01:19:59,015
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard about that.

1230
01:19:59,276 --> 01:19:59,936
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, whatever.

1231
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:01,777
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1232
01:20:02,772 --> 01:20:04,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, DarkSakura, you have anything last minute?

1233
01:20:07,695 --> 01:20:10,737
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, is this show not living up to your expectations tonight?

1234
01:20:11,398 --> 01:20:12,718
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had a headache most of the show.

1235
01:20:12,898 --> 01:20:14,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this just, oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1236
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody screamed in my ear, both of you.

1237
01:20:17,061 --> 01:20:17,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Take two of these.

1238
01:20:18,622 --> 01:20:19,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, Nuprin.

1239
01:20:19,342 --> 01:20:19,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Little.

1240
01:20:19,983 --> 01:20:20,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Yellow.

1241
01:20:20,623 --> 01:20:20,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Different.

1242
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:25,226
[SPEAKER_08]: You did the Wayne's World reference version, didn't you?

1243
01:20:25,746 --> 01:20:27,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the other one was Little Yellow Different Better.

1244
01:20:28,548 --> 01:20:29,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Was the real commercial.

1245
01:20:29,629 --> 01:20:29,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow.

1246
01:20:30,887 --> 01:20:31,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Beer

1247
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:57,770
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1248
01:21:18,767 --> 01:21:20,429
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com

1249
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:50,920
[SPEAKER_13]: So for part B, we're going to get out the dinner table like we're at Denny's or whatever diner.

1250
01:21:51,701 --> 01:21:52,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's order some pizza.

1251
01:21:52,481 --> 01:21:53,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's order pizza.

1252
01:21:53,262 --> 01:21:59,848
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're going to open up the Skype line and we're going to have you guys call in and just talk shit with us for a few hours about games and everything.

1253
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:02,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you guys want to pass on your congratulations, that's cool too.

1254
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:05,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever you want to do for, you know, it's going to be your show.

1255
01:22:05,673 --> 01:22:07,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, I remember the first show though.

1256
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:08,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, some good times.

1257
01:22:08,515 --> 01:22:13,700
[SPEAKER_08]: I was in this chair, passed out with a migraine.

1258
01:22:14,482 --> 01:22:17,424
[SPEAKER_08]: And the second show, man, that was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room.

1259
01:22:18,385 --> 01:22:22,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And Pat Charisse was in chat and says, yay, we can hear the same three people for an hour.

1260
01:22:23,249 --> 01:22:25,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we're hoping that that won't happen.

1261
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:30,935
[SPEAKER_13]: We're actually kind of hoping that maybe some folks might drop in on the Skype line that you wouldn't expect.

1262
01:22:31,355 --> 01:22:31,975
[SPEAKER_13]: So who knows?

1263
01:22:32,115 --> 01:22:35,858
[SPEAKER_13]: We're hoping to get some callers we may not usually get on the program.

1264
01:22:35,898 --> 01:22:38,120
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what we're looking at for next week.

1265
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,601
[SPEAKER_13]: We should get Scott on the Skype.

1266
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,282
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be funny.

1267
01:22:40,342 --> 01:22:40,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Possibly.

1268
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:42,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, who knows who's going to call in next week.

1269
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:43,224
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

1270
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:44,442
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1271
01:22:45,282 --> 01:22:54,485
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to put the call out there, but we do want our listeners to get in on it, too, because even those folks that have, even the same three people that always call in, definitely make this show a part of what it is.

1272
01:22:55,085 --> 01:22:59,586
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you've never listened live before and you want to get in, next week is an excellent chance to do that.

1273
01:22:59,866 --> 01:23:04,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our live 365 station.

1274
01:23:04,348 --> 01:23:07,748
[SPEAKER_13]: More information can be found at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1275
01:23:07,969 --> 01:23:11,029
[SPEAKER_14]: I do know that next week's discussion will be quite interesting.

1276
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:12,890
[SPEAKER_14]: After all, we are getting close to E3.

1277
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:22,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you saying that even though you got slapped on the wrist about something a while ago, possibly next week, you're going to spill some big-ass beans?

1278
01:23:23,385 --> 01:23:23,686
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1279
01:23:23,786 --> 01:23:23,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

1280
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:24,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe?

1281
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:25,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Thinking about it?

1282
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:27,068
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crossed my mind.

1283
01:23:27,248 --> 01:23:27,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Crossed your mind?

1284
01:23:28,189 --> 01:23:28,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Stay tuned.

1285
01:23:28,689 --> 01:23:29,310
[SPEAKER_13]: That could be fun.

1286
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:30,431
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1287
01:23:31,472 --> 01:23:34,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, we're going to wrap it up for this week.

1288
01:23:34,494 --> 01:23:38,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1289
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:40,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1290
01:23:40,789 --> 01:23:46,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Explicit, sorry we didn't have a fourth mic or something so you can get in on the action more often, but we appreciate you being here as always.

1291
01:23:46,173 --> 01:23:47,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

1292
01:23:47,353 --> 01:23:52,537
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, keep it up with the Wii cosplay and whatever other creative cosplays you come up with.

1293
01:23:53,658 --> 01:23:56,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll show up on Anime Expo and SAC Anime as well.

1294
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:57,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1295
01:23:57,321 --> 01:23:58,121
[SPEAKER_03]: When is SAC Anime?

1296
01:23:58,642 --> 01:23:59,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It's July 13th through the 15th.

1297
01:24:01,391 --> 01:24:02,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make an appearance somehow.

1298
01:24:03,232 --> 01:24:04,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be there.

1299
01:24:05,094 --> 01:24:06,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually staffed there now.

1300
01:24:06,595 --> 01:24:07,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we do a panel or something?

1301
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:08,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, get us a panel.

1302
01:24:09,016 --> 01:24:09,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see what I can do.

1303
01:24:09,737 --> 01:24:11,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk to the management.

1304
01:24:12,099 --> 01:24:13,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell them you know internet celebrities.

1305
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:15,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk to them about it.

1306
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:16,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't lie.

1307
01:24:16,322 --> 01:24:18,483
[SPEAKER_03]: They trust me a lot now.

1308
01:24:19,124 --> 01:24:19,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, sounds good.

1309
01:24:20,324 --> 01:24:20,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't abuse it.

1310
01:24:22,206 --> 01:24:22,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1311
01:24:23,347 --> 01:24:24,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Want to ruin your rep real fast?

1312
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:25,488
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

1313
01:24:25,588 --> 01:24:26,148
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a good rep.

1314
01:24:26,189 --> 01:24:27,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a good rep with people.

1315
01:24:27,049 --> 01:24:28,470
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really, really disgusting.

1316
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:29,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I know.

1317
01:24:29,551 --> 01:24:30,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

1318
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:31,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

1319
01:24:31,724 --> 01:24:32,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Your final thought.

1320
01:24:32,524 --> 01:24:33,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And it smells bad.

1321
01:24:33,585 --> 01:24:35,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Stay tuned for the afterbirth.

1322
01:24:37,387 --> 01:24:38,387
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my final thought.

1323
01:24:38,487 --> 01:24:40,428
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're listening live, otherwise you're screwed.

1324
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,248
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura?

1325
01:24:42,049 --> 01:24:48,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel really stupid because I deleted almost everything out of my FTP, including the banner for my live journal, so I have to go home and re-upload it.

1326
01:24:49,873 --> 01:24:59,337
[SPEAKER_08]: The via was dying, so in three days my computer that was given to me by Vandalus is going to be up and running, and I need to think of a clever name for it.

1327
01:25:01,603 --> 01:25:05,845
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought is now I want ice cream.

1328
01:25:06,426 --> 01:25:08,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't want ice cream a couple hours ago, but now I do.

1329
01:25:08,367 --> 01:25:09,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I have chocolate mint pudding at home.

1330
01:25:10,828 --> 01:25:11,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds good.

1331
01:25:12,609 --> 01:25:12,910
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1332
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:17,813
