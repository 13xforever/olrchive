Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, the 17th of June, 2007.
Happy Father's Day again to those of you folks that are gamer daddies.
We're gonna get back into the gaming news.
Remember, Orange Launch Radio is released in two parts.
And if you haven't listened to Part A, you missed a lot tonight.
So please, go back to wherever you got this show and make sure you've tuned in to Part A. Let's continue on with tonight's program.
And I'm gonna start us off with some more gaming news in this segment.
We talked a lot about PlayStation 3 and a little bit about computer games.
Started to dip into Xbox a little bit in the last segment.
We didn't really mention the Wii a whole lot.
Madden 2008
Thanks for watching!
Madden 08 is not going to use that.
Quote, Madden Wii doesn't support the Wii's friend system during online play.
This is something we're still working on with Nintendo.
For now, our online play uses your EA Nation persona to search and manage your EA Messenger account.
So now you're going to have to balance this whole other thing.
But what?
What if this is something that they're going to support through all their EA games?
Which is fine, then, if they're going to do that.
as long as it's not... I mean, you can call their friend code wherever you want.
If you gotta enter one in for each game, who gives a shit?
I mean...
I just kind of wish Nintendo would just wake up.
Because they're saying we're having problems with Nintendo.
Why is Nintendo holding back on this stuff?
That's obviously what's going on here.
Nintendo's done this with the DS.
They held back on so much of what the DS actually had in it.
They didn't launch DS online until like a year and a half after the system was out.
And then there was also the whole microphone and the voice chatting is just now happening.
I don't know if Nintendo likes to time release the features of their system to...
Make it last longer or what the deal is, but it's weird.
What's that?
Explicit?
I thought it was more technical issues.
I don't know, but it just seems to me like, you know, you're not seeing any online games.
I don't think it's because no one wants to do it.
I think it's because Nintendo's kind of keeping some secrets down or something like that.
Bandit in chatroom says, Online play doesn't start until Nintendo says so, and the next gen doesn't start until Sony says so.
SSJ100 Matt being very random in our chatroom, chat.orangellonsradio.com
Dear Nintendo, bring back the Game Boy printer.
Well, knowing Nintendo, maybe there'll be something to attach it to later, to, like, print out your me or something like that.
RossDLUT brings up a good point.
EA could easily just say, no Madden for the Wii unless you stop with the friend codes.
I don't know, though.
I mean, that's, you know, still... Wii's selling pretty good to an audience that, you know, may not necessarily have a 360, so I think you still want to get Madden out to that audience somehow.
I don't know.
Well, Madden Wii is going to get some other funny features in there as well, including some minigames, Mii integration, and the ability to draw on the screen.
Yes, you too can be just like John Madden and draw on the screen with the brand new Wii Telestrator.
So that's kind of funny.
and, of course, like FIFA and some of the other games that are coming out, you will be able to integrate your Mii in there.
They're going to have a whole set of Mii games, kind of similar, I'm guessing, to Madden 07, you know, just field training and whatnot.
Okay, so you can sketch all over the board like it was, you know, real football and everything, but the $64,000 question is, will you be able to write out boobs on the prompt, on the little thing?
I think you can.
How very un-Nintendo-like.
Amen.
What's that on there?
Then again, Nintendo's supposed to be releasing a child porn game for the DS.
What?
No, no, no.
That is Namco.
Or SNK, I'm sorry.
SNK.
The only new game that they're putting out was that stupid, you know, touch the, you know, witches thing to see if they're witches and you flick their boobs and shit.
What in the fuck are you talking about?
Maybe you should read some more Kotaku, okay?
Or something.
There's at least one story a day about this damn game.
Give me a break.
Give me a break.
There's like 50,000 game blogs out there I'm trying to juggle.
But there's a lot of touching of, you know, women, and you flick their boobs and stuff.
I'm poking Jamie to see if she's a witch right now, actually.
She's about ready to break her bottle.
I beard you.
I beard you.
Wow.
Jamie does not like to be poked and declared a witch.
And Matt in 08 will be online.
I found a witch.
May we burn her?
Of course.
Burn the witch.
You know, they're going to have a two-on-two, um...
versus Mode as well for the minigames, so that's kind of cool.
Madden 2008 featuring hot two-on-two action.
So I have some happy news, like none of us didn't see this coming.
The Wii and the DS are outselling their Sony counterparts with a vengeance.
There have been 338,000 units sold in May.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and, dear God, why anyone would want the Spider-Man 3 game, because it wasn't all that good, and Pokemon Pearl.
And Wii Play was on number five, so isn't that cool?
Not really, because the game kind of blows.
So guess what?
What?
The same thing is happening in Japan.
Oh, really?
Like any of us are surprised.
So, dear Sony, bite our asses, not love me.
Someone's a little bitter over Sony right now.
What's up with this?
Why all of a sudden Sony angst?
You weren't swayed by anything you heard about the agency in Part A?
Okay.
Parappa?
No?
Silent Hill 5?
Parappa!
Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction is going to be awesome.
Project Hammer has been cancelled.
IGN has moved on to look at some more expanded audience projects.
Whatever that is supposed to mean.
Hopefully it's something original no matter what it is.
But there it is.
Nintendo, by the way, has not released an official statement.
But some folks have kind of seen this coming for a little while because Project Hammer went into this mysterious TBA status on its website.
And it has yet to move from that status.
So there you go.
It was supposed to be a very interesting plot where you had a hammer-wielding cyborg and you're protecting the U.S.
from killer robots.
MC Hammer do the voice for Project Hammer.
That would have been so appropriate.
Well, you can't touch this game now.
It's been cancelled, actually.
Hammer, don't let them hurt you.
Did either of you guys see this at E3 last year when we were all there?
Yeah, I remember Project Hammer.
I think they still had it on the website, on Nintendo's website.
Well, this is a rumor.
It's not officially cancelled, but all signs point to... I don't know.
I know, just working in the retail and distribution side, there's a lot of things that go cancelled for a while and then come back.
It's just because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you, Loki, for bringing down the maturity level of this show to a whole new low.
Appreciate it.
No problem.
Just real quick, some chat comments from chat room.
Ranma says, Interesting.
Yeah, it didn't look that bad.
I mean, you know, considering that the Wii just simply isn't as powerful as the other systems.
Well, there you go.
All right.
So, another interesting game coming out to the DS is going to be Taika No Touch in DS.
And Taika No Touch in DS is going to have these two little kind of cute stylus drum things, I guess, for it.
So you're going to be able to beat the screen like a taiko drum.
Aren't the styluses kind of already drumsticks?
Yeah, but it's two of them now, so you have two of them that you can drum the screen with.
But your DS actually comes with two styluses.
They give you a spare in there, and yet you still lose these little bastards everywhere.
Maybe if my wife lost the stylus.
Whatever, who cares?
You get two free styluses with it.
That's awesome.
So you can play this game once.
You just figured.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, you know, there is something that a bunch of us have played several times, I'm sure, if we had any real video game taste, which those of us in this room do.
So, wonderfully, it is now Europe's virtual console's 100th game, F-Zero X, which is like freaking rad.
I remember playing a ton of F-Zero X. You know what's funny?
F-Zero X is the one F-Zero game I didn't play.
I know, I played the one on the Super Nintendo, definitely the GameCube one, which was so underrated.
F-Zero X was like hotness.
Well, maybe they'll release it here.
Maybe that's a good sign that it's coming here.
Or you can come to my house and play it on my Nintendo 64.
You're actually going to hook that shit up just so we can play F-Zero X?
If I can find it, I will.
All right, it's a date.
I'll hook it up on my Nintendo 64.
Oh, that's right, I threw mine away in a dumpster.
I still have my Nintendo 64 in a box somewhere.
I can't find my Dreamcast, though.
I have...
all the accessories for the Dreamcast I think I'm missing a box I also have a Dreamcast sitting in a box over there that's not being used I want to use it as a Nintendo emulator and play some Guardian Legend again
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Put them on this cartridge and play pirated old school Nintendo games to your heart's content.
And it will only cost you $135 if you get one of these things.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, I mean, compact flash readers are not exactly cheap pieces of equipment and the whole thing.
We were joking, myself and my wife were joking, because we saw another one of those iPhone commercials that they have on TV.
They're all, this isn't just, you know, the internet for phone.
This isn't, you know, scaled down internet.
This is the real internet.
I'm like, it better be the fucking real internet for $600.
And then she's like, you should say that about every feature on it.
I'm like, yeah, it better fucking be for $600.
There's lots of people waiting for their iPhones.
I know this.
Well, shit.
It better be everything that they promise it will be because it's $600.
Apparently the AMA is debating on whether to recognize game addiction as a real addiction.
So yeah, they're going to be debating about it and looking at all the facts and sooner or later we will have something for someone to talk about saying, hey, game addiction's real, see?
It's just like alcoholism.
It's a disease.
How exactly does one go about debating game addiction?
Fucking fine, though.
I don't know.
Exploring the possible dangers of excessive video game playing that's over two hours a day.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
Where are you going with this exactly?
These people don't have addiction to gaming.
They're obsessive-compulsive, and gaming just happens to be the object of their disorder.
Loki, rebuttal.
Okay, well, still though, that's technically game addiction.
They're addicted to games.
I mean, with OCD or whatever, they're not drinking tons of alcohol.
They're not gambling or anything like that.
Gambling is also obsessive-compulsive.
True, these are all... Okay, well, I can have lung cancer or I can have cancer, but it doesn't mean it's necessarily lung cancer or not necessarily from smoking or something.
Are you saying games give you cancer?
Addiction, I think, requires ingestion of a particular substance that your body eventually becomes dependent upon.
Having a physical thing that you are...
Obsessively Compulsed to Participate in is not the same as a physical addiction.
It's just that by doing this task over and over again, your brain chemicals are saying, hey, I like this and I want to keep doing this, as opposed to you actually having a physical addiction to a substance that your body is starting to need to maintain a particular level of normalcy, I guess.
So you're basically saying World of Warcraft is not an injectable substance.
Right.
Rebuttal.
How many weekends have you skipped going out with friends and stuff to play World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI?
You're pointing at me and like maybe one.
Because he knows that I haven't done it.
When I was sad and fat.
If you're going to point at me.
You're not sad anymore.
You just lost the debate, bitch.
You insulted the ref.
Loki is the winner, ladies and gentlemen.
I leave it to the chatroom to vote.
Chatroom vote.
Remember, our opinions don't matter.
It's the chatroom's vote.
Loki, anything else you wish to add in all seriousness?
No, seriously, gaming addiction as something that needs to be treated or something...
That's retarded.
Fucking parents need to step in and just fucking say, Stop playing your damn games!
Or if you're older, just have your girlfriend say, Stop playing your damn games!
Which is what you have.
I'm putting my drugs for OCD.
That's how Loki curbed his gaming addiction, is he married a woman that will pull the plug on him.
I still play two hours of games a day, if that.
More than that.
Okay, then what's my excuse?
I was a massive gamer, married my husband, and now I don't really play that much anymore, except for pinball.
He still plays more than I do.
I don't care.
He's welcome to as long as he leaves me alone.
Well, there's going to be another kiss with Jack Thompson about this.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, no.
He who shall not be named.
Explicit hasn't been here in a year.
He doesn't know about some of our banning topics.
We do not mention his name in these circles.
It's code name Lord Voldemort is actually what we refer to him as on the show.
So whenever you hear Lord Voldemort, that's JT.
G4 was banned too, but somebody else brought it up earlier.
Leave it to Loki to bring that up.
So there you go.
GS191 sums it up.
Well, there's your cure.
Marriage cures gaming addiction.
Examples, Loki and DarkSakura.
No, it doesn't.
I still play.
I was never addicted.
Because there's no such thing as gaming addiction.
I'm not addicted to games.
It's like this.
My wife doesn't like the fact that I talk about games a lot.
Because, well, I work in the games industry.
I play games.
I do this show.
So I'm, you know, talking about work, you know, my outside stuff, what I'm doing, and unfortunately that all comes back to games, because it all has something to do with games, usually.
I think about movies, though.
A lot about movies.
And Transformers.
But, um... Still, though, it's just... There... I don't think... I think there's, you know, people have addictive behavior, but these people, if games weren't around, they'd be addicted to something else.
So... Whatever.
Just fucking...
Be responsible people.
That's what people need to do.
Alright.
It's all done.
The debate's over.
Jamie already lost because she made fun of the ref.
Alright.
Let's... But Rob, I do that all the time.
It's because I love you.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
DarkSakura, who emailed us this week?
Some people.
A bunch of people, and I'm not reading all these fucking emails, so I'll just, like, start here.
Um, this one comes from Osfer.
Hey, it's Osfer again.
I swear I wasn't drunk, Osfer.
Hey, shush.
Okay.
Since I lack a high-speed connection, I always have to go to a friend's house and wirelessly download your podcast to my PSP.
It's been a few weeks since I last listened to this show, so I downloaded all that I could up to the current podcast.
An episode a few weeks ago, I found hilarious that Rob called his mom...
We got to find out some things that we never knew about him.
Like how he dressed up as Courtney Love in lip syncs.
Do we really have to bring that up again?
Good lord, you guys should find a video and upload it to the site if you can.
We are not retelling the story for your benefit explicitly.
Go download the podcast.
There's still a... One week there should be a Parents of OLR show where you all call your parents or bring them on the show.
I'm sure some more interesting things could be revealed about you guys.
Anyway, thanks for reading.
You know, if we got my mom out here, that would be great because I want to get my mom to California.
and for me it was kind of like a one time joke like you know sequels aren't ever as good as the original it was kind of like a one time joke it happened that was the Mother's Day show by the way where that happened so there you have it no but that was good my mom did great on the show considering she really did have no idea we have considering she had no idea we were calling her live she did a great job so I was very proud of her so the next email dun dun dun if you're ready hey you know it's that person again but this is great
And now I give you ten random questions spurred from my void of boredom.
This is Ossifer again?
Yes.
I still am not drunk, Ossifer, I swear.
One, freeze.
What are you all doing right now at this moment?
The fucking show?
Yeah, we're doing a radio show.
Actually, Loki is not doing a radio show.
I can clearly see, plain as day, Loki is playing on some Transformers-related website and not paying attention to the mailbag.
Now, now, this is game-related.
This is the opening cinematic for Transformers the game.
So, huh!
And I'm paying attention.
I just got served.
Two.
Okay, you can move now.
What is your favorite drink that helps you get up and go?
Coffee.
Tea.
Loki's stacking Pepsi cans over there.
Honestly, water.
Or coffee.
If I need caffeine, coffee.
Otherwise, I drink a crap load of water.
But tonight, it's Malibu and root beer.
Which isn't as bad of a combination as you might think.
How many questions?
Wait, this is ten random questions you said?
Oh boy, it's only a three-hour show.
Let's keep it moving.
What is the capital of Germany?
Wienerschnitzel.
Four.
What is your favorite song on either Beatmania 2DX or DDR?
No, the Germany question is still bugging me.
It was the city that was separated for so long.
Berlin.
Berlin?
Yes, it was Berlin.
I like Berlin, the band.
On the metro.
I like Wienerschnitzel, though.
That's it for the questions.
Oh, that's it?
No more questions?
I'm not going to read any more.
Dear Orange Lounge Radio, there needs to be an Oregon Trail for the DS, dammit.
I'd prefer it be based on Oregon Trail 2 engine, but considering the chances of it coming out, I'd be happy anyways.
What are other things y'all wish for?
Perhaps even more Actraiser for Sky if he insists.
Also, though not related to gaming, there should be a Deadpool movie.
Yes!
Unless they royally screw it up like X-Men 3, then I'd cry forever.
That's Tim Surugi.
Sorry, I had to look up on Wikipedia what the capital of Germany was because I didn't want to look like a dumb shit any more than I already do on the entire internet.
It is Berlin, by the way.
If they did a Deadpool movie, they'd have to get the guy that does his voice in the game because he was the Crypt Keeper.
Sorry, what was our emailer emailing us about?
I was too busy on Wikipedia.
What else would I see on DS that was old school gaming?
Besides the mandatory Guardian Legend answer.
No, you know what?
I don't want to see retro games on the DS.
I want to see retro games on consoles I can play on my TV just like the old retro games.
Zero.
There's nothing I want to see on DS that's retro.
MDK.
That's pretty old school.
I think that would be fun.
Because I like me some MDK.
Did they ever make a sequel to MDK?
I thought they had one.
Yes, they did, unfortunately.
Insanest is yelling in chatroom, Archon, Archon, Archon, over and over again.
That was a pretty awesome game.
I'll give you that.
Or Starcon.
I say nothing.
Let's see.
This one's too long, and I'm just going to end up posting it on the forums anyway.
Okay.
Okay.
I also got an email from one of the people who emailed me in French.
It says, thank you for replying to my email.
I felt like such a star when you read my letter.
I'm not used to all this.
By the way, you guys are talking about Sony a whole lot.
Thanks for making the effort.
And I might have to go and pick up a Pokemon game or two.
You guys seem to really love them.
I have to be honest, we didn't really change anything in the creation of the show.
It's just that I guess the weeks you were listening previous, there just was a lot of Xbox-heavy news.
But right now, there seems to be actually more Sony and PC news this week.
So it just depends on the flow of news, what we cover.
By the way, that was Spamouflage.
I love that name.
That's a pretty rad name.
And then I'm not going to read any more e-mails.
Are the emailers being punished?
I'll read one.
One more, alright.
From AZHP.
Okay.
Hi guys, I was listening to your podcast on the way to class today and I noticed you guys talking about how Mario Party 8 backups don't work on the Wii.
As I am a college student and I back up my games so that I don't have to lug around DVD cases back and forth, I'm mentioning this so I don't get you guys in trouble for talking of piracy.
In fact, I've also contributed to the design of a Wii mod ship for this purpose.
Anyway, I can confirm that Mario Party 8 backups work fine.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That brings me to my question for you guys.
Do you think it's possible for a company to stop piracy in its tracks?
Fuck no.
That was me, by the way.
Do you think that the funds invested in stopping piracy is greater than the potential loss incurred from allowing it to run rampant?
I'm not asking if the monetary value of the pirated goods is significant.
Obviously it is.
However, most people who pirate wouldn't buy nearly the same amount of games as they are pirating.
So do you think it's the company's best interest to stop modding, or do you think it's something that they do in order to appease uneducated shareholders?
That's a good question.
I think it is not in their interest, but I want to hear your two cents.
Sorry for the long email.
Hope you guys enjoyed it.
AZHB.
I think that that's part of it, too.
The average boardroom suit and tie person is only going to look at numbers.
They're only going to look at face value good idea because, remember, once you get into upper management, you turn into a moron.
Wow, someone's jaded.
That's all right, I understand.
I think that some of it is for, you know, face.
Some of it is, I think, they want to discourage the casual pirates.
These people said, oh, I can just clip this on the back of my PlayStation and I can play whatever, blah, blah, blah.
They want to discourage those people who don't know what the fuck they're doing.
For those of us who know what we're doing, there's not going to be any way that they can stop us if we try hard enough.
If we care enough.
Here's my thing, is that with no disrespect to the emailer, you go to all this trouble to back up games because you don't want to haul DVD cases around.
Am I really supposed to believe that?
I mean, I guess.
I guess it's possible.
It just seems to me like that's... It's not that I'm saying like, oh, you're a thief or whatever.
I'm just like, that seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to.
Just to not have to carry around DVD cases, which aren't that big a deal.
Better yet, if you're backing up a game, say, onto another DVD to play it on your system, aren't you still carrying around that DVD?
It's just now it's a backed up one instead of the real one.
I don't understand how that's cutting down on DVDs.
Of course, our chat room is chiming in here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Blackwolf, our old buddy who just turned 100 today, said, we tried to stop them, but they always get by what we do.
It sounds better than, well, we won't do anything because they'll get around it anyway.
I guess that's a good point, kind of going back to the boardroom things going on there.
NintendoManiac64 says, backing up DS and GBA games is very helpful, though.

Halo 3 Controllers and Headsets
and this is going to be coming out from GameStop.
At least GameStop is now listing them.
Everyone's going to have them.
Everyone's going to have them but GameStop has kind of spilled the beans on it.
This is $59.99 for the wireless controllers because you're going to pay $10 more because they have pretty pictures on them.
One has the Spartan, one has the Covenant and then there is also a green headset that's going to be coming out.
I don't see the price for this one.
Oh, it's also $59.99, the wireless headset.
All it really is, it's green and the button is orange and it has a
Halo 3 Master Chief
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I got a Halo Xbox, and I'm not even that big a Halo fan.
I just bought it because that's when I finally decided to buy an Xbox.
And it probably came with a free game, didn't it?
Halo, actually.
Hence the Halo Xbox.
Anyways, I'm not a big fan of Halo, but I am a big fan of this game.
Grand Theft Auto 4.
They're getting a new trailer coming out on June 28th.
Yes, once again, teasing us.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Are you really that excited over a trailer?
Yes, because it's just like the Transformers movie.
I watch every bit of stuff I can on it.
Of course, now I'm going to start slowing down because I don't want to spoil anything.
Although I've already spoiled too much.
Fair enough, I suppose.
Well, something that I guess people will care about is that Track and Field...
is going to be closer to release on Xbox Live Arcade probably in, quote, the next month or two.
Yeah, it's track and field.
Not one of the best old school Konami games that exist, but...
Well, they've had some pretty good ones lately.
Like, I like Time Pilot.
Russian Attack was kind of fun.
But Track and Field was just like, you just would slam the button.
It's make my thumbs hurt the game.
Yeah, it's like all those old school Mario Party games where you just hit the button over and over and over again.
That's all Track and Field was.
One auto-fire controller will fix that.
Hell yeah.
That's why we had the turbo button on the TurboGrafx.
Hi.
I needed to find one of those.
Easy Achievement Points.
Hell yeah.
Well, maybe there'll be something to kind of get around the auto-fire or something.
You'd think they'd put something into place, but we'll see, I guess.
Oh, they won't?
Come on!
These people are lazy when it comes to making these games.
They're just pouring it straight over.
Maybe that'll be a title that comes out.
Like, you know how some weeks they've been doing two games a week lately?
Maybe that'll be kind of the B-side for the week will be track and field.
Anyhow, Halo 2 and Shadowrun, of course, both recently came out in the new Games for Windows collection that's Vista only, or is it?
Falling Leaf Studios has actually gone to extents to make the games XP compatible.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
that says, first, Microsoft claimed that it was impossible to implement DirectX 10 compatibility atop Windows XP.
And now they also want us to believe that they couldn't successfully launch two DirectX 9-based titles on XP either.
We plan to expose both theories as patently false.
But now they haven't really, you know, they haven't showed this to be true yet.
The software doesn't already exist.
Supposedly, this is going to come out within a few months.
We shall see if they can expose that to work.
It's a huge scam.
Is it a scam?
You're still getting the game for the regular price.
It's just that they got a cut of it from Amazon.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Bandit in chat is very adamant here.
He says, it's a fake.
He's 19 and is lying.
He makes 10% on that shiznit.
That's true.
There's really nothing they can do about it.
Somebody complained to Amazon, maybe.
I don't know.
Well...
Yes, our usual fucking plug for GameTap.
But anyways, this is news.
Brand new, their free service that they launched, I believe, last month.
They're actually now going to be expanding it, which was currently 30 games, to 40 games now.
So I guess they've got a few more people backing it.
And they've also, I guess, for the regular subscription service, they've added Psychonauts, King of Fighters 97, Golden Axe the Duel, Art of Fighting 3, and Metal Slug 3.
Dude, Golden Axe the Duel.
I think that's pretty awesome that Psychonauts is on there.
Those are some pretty awesome games they put on there for free.
Dude, I love Golden Axe.
I don't like the first Genesis one.
It makes me miss the arcade.
The Duel was actually one of the first Saturn games I ever played.
I keep forgetting you have a Saturn.
When I lived in Alabama, my friend wanted a Saturn so badly he imported it.
He was the world's biggest Sega fanboy.
So he imported a Saturn.
So the first games I got to play was King of Fighters 95.
I learned the Ram Cart Switch.
And Golden Axe the Duel and some Gundam game that was okay.
Actdeft in our chatroom is getting very excited.
King of Fighters 97 for free.
No, it's for paid accounts.
Oh, only the paid accounts?
Those are your games for the paid accounts.
Although it may cycle through into the free games.
You never know.
There's 40 games to choose from right now for free.
Interesting.
That would suck though if you were getting really attached to a title and then they pull the plug on it.
But I guess that's how they make their money.
They're not in business to just give things away.
I guess that's true.
Well,
One thing that I think our Second Life friends will enjoy, another thing to keep you ingrained in unreality, is that they are adding voice.
It's actually, from what I understand, it's at Warhead, one of the places in Second Life.
I don't play Second Life, so I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.
Me neither.
You are greeted by...
Dancing and Flying Sperm and Gunfire That sounds like Second Life This is even better than the Flying Cocks That is something that they should turn into a TV show Second Life TV show But apparently now that's not happening anymore because they have voice chat So people, you can download a special version of the client and in certain places, and one of the places is Waterhead you can hang out and just chat with people
Dude, you know what I can do?
I can pick up my phone and call people and chat with them if I wanted to fucking talk to people.
I'm online for a reason.
Drew Nami in chat says, it's about fucking time, Second Life.
There has had voice for fucking ever.
Well, there is like a competing type of thing that has had voice chat for a while.
I've heard of there before.
Remember DDR Angel when she was coming on this program?
She was really into there.
Was that game she was really into.
So, huh.
I did find the Final Fantasy 7 thing that they made in Second Life.
It was pretty cool.
I've always wanted to check out Second Life, but I always go back to World of Warcraft because I have no First Life.
And I was like, oh my god, this sucks, and then deleted it.
I'm afraid that with Second Life, it would be like me and The Sims, where no good can come of this.
We should start, can't you start a little OLR club or something?
I don't want to do that.
Like, I just want, there used to be like a little all games room, but then somebody stopped paying rent on it or whatever, so it got imploded.
Because I remember somebody sent us a picture of our little OLR logo somewhere in Second Life, and I was like, oh, that's kind of neat.
There you have it.
So much for Second Life.
While I was bored during my first life, I was surfing on Dig.
And this story was dug, which I thought was interesting.
It's from the website TooOldToPlay.com.
And the topic is about, it says, childhood gaming, what games would you like remade?
And it just basically goes on to say, hey, you know, we remember these games from when we were older, from the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Genesis, and 3DO.
Apparently this author remembers the 3DO.
I do not remember the 3DO.
Shadowgate 2, WWF Wrestling Arcade Game 3, River City Ransom 4, Maniac Mansion 5, Akari Warriors 15
Just talking about how we would like to see these kind of redesigned.
Maniac Mansion has a sequel.
I thought it did, but all these series kind of died a long time ago.
I guess.
And he says he remembers Zelda, but he can't really say Zelda because Zelda's not really dead.
He's talking about these series are all kind of dead.
Ross Steel UT in chat says Crystallis.
That's a good pick.
That was a good game.
I also like from this list 11 RC Pro-Am.
You know I can't get through this segment without saying Guardian Legend.
It's a must.
What other old school game?
How about StarTropics?
What the hell ever happened to StarTropics?
I'm surprised it hasn't made it to Virtual Console yet.
I'm surprised too, and I'm surprised that the... What was the kid's name in StarTropics?
There is a perfect character for Smash Bros.,
at some point.
God, why can't I remember the kid's name?
The only bad thing, though, about that is going to be the fact that you have to dip that manual in water.
I think it was Mikey or Mike or something.
Mikey, I think, was Goonies, too.
He had a really generic name.
And it was Zeb or Zeke or something that was a bad guy.
Yeah.
There you go.
Anyways, so we talked a little bit about MAME earlier.
Now, one of the boards for...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
It was no Street Fighter 2 or... I never really got into Street Fighter 3.
Maybe I'm not giving you enough credit, but I didn't care for it.
It wasn't Street Fighter Alpha.
I had my one moment of glory in Street Fighter 3.
Yeah, I had a moment.
No, I played it a lot, but I had my moment of glory.
Street Fighter 3 and I went out on a date, but we just didn't get along.
And it wouldn't put out, so I had to say goodbye.
There you have it.
But I guess that's cool for all you folks that like to pirate tons and tons of arcade games and play them on MAME.
That's great news for you guys, so congratulations.
Well, here's an interesting thing that's being advertised for GameStop.com is a Wii Blaster available June 27th.
Like pew pew pew lasers, I guess.
Um...
But it's on one of their flyers that it will be available, like I said, on the 27th.
I guess to go out with... What game's coming out on Wii that's going to require a gun, maybe?
Well, there's Chicken Shoot.
Oh, yay!
Chicken Shoot!
Hey, I guess you may be able to use it for maybe Resident Evil 4.
Yeah.
Well, later on, back when we get into the Fall Umbrella Chronicles and Ghost Squad, I don't know.
But why do we need this yet?
Maybe Duck Hunt on Virtual Console.
Duck Hunt!
Or better yet, this is just a piece of useless crap that they're trying to push on you.
Or how about this, better yet, why don't Nintendo do what Nintendo does best and hold out on the good stuff?
So instead of giving us Duck Hunt, why don't you give us Wild Gunman?
which if you've ever played Wild Gunman maybe we'll get Blastress there was seriously nothing to Wild Gunman it was who can pull the trigger faster when the thing says go Wild Gunman, they made an entire video game and sold this for a lot of money an entire game out of who can push the button first was the game so you'll probably see that on Virtual Console and then you'll get such brilliant classics like Hogan's Alley
And only then will Nintendo finally deliver the duck hunt.
Not quite as orange as the other one, but accomplishes the same thing, basically.
Puts your Wii nunchuck kind of in the pistol grip area, and then, you know, the remote on top.
To be honest, both of these are completely useless.
It's not the Wii kind of shotgun thing that you saw at E3.
This is something completely different.
It does not enhance your gameplay at all.
Frisbee in chat reminds us about something related to Wild Gunman.
Frisbee says, Wild Gunman was good on WarioWare Game Boy Advance.
I totally forgot that it was in that game.
But yeah, there was many references to Wild Gunman in there.
Interesting.
I don't know.
Is this a peripheral you're interested in getting, Jamie?
I know you like to collect everything related to games.
That's what I thought.
Me too.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, because people are dumb and will buy it.
Yeah, exactly.
I was like, dude, remember the consumer market?
Stupid.
Make stuff stupid people will want.
Maybe having one of these plastic things shaped like a tennis racket will help you win the first organized Wii tennis tournament that any of us know of.
It's called Wimbledon.
Get it?
Instead of Wimbledon.
Ha!
Wimbledon!
It's being held June 23rd at Barcade, which is in Brooklyn.
I was just there.
It's pretty awesome.
Barcade's pretty cool.
God damn it, I should have gone to Barcade.
I knew of that place.
I knew it was in Brooklyn.
I was fucking in Brooklyn just a week ago, and I didn't even think to go to this place.
Oh well.
Here's a quote from the official site for Wimbledon.
Wimbledon is a Wii Tennis tournament being held on June 23rd, that's next Saturday, from noon until 5pm at Barcade in Brooklyn, specifically Williamsburg.
There will be singles and doubles tournaments, prizes, and beer!
Maybe even some strawberries and cream.
Oh, and cucumber sandwiches.
Okay.
I guess that's a joke about Wimbledon that I don't get.
I don't know.
I don't watch tennis on TV or anything, but I like Wii Tennis.
It's kind of fun.
Yeah.
I know it's not real tennis, but there you go.
I was just thinking, you know, those plastic attachments for the Wii and stuff.
You know people have trouble as it is holding on to the Wiimote.
Can you imagine that with a chunk of plastic flying towards your TV?
Talk about some serious damage right there.
So, wow.
Anywho.
Uh, so yeah, you want to get scared?
Well, here's your chance.
Um, WifeSwap is looking for gamers to be on their show.
Wait, like the TV show?
Yes, like the TV show.
Wasn't that the one that had, like, my favorite lady ever?
Yes, the god warrior.
I fucking love her.
She's the best thing ever.
So, um, yeah, so apparently you can, or possibly if you're picked, um, you and another family will swap wives and...
Can you imagine if Jamie went on this program?
I want no money!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I think Loki would be a good candidate for this show, too.
I don't plan on breeding, so... I thought you were going to have a kid named Error.
No.
If you are interested and you qualify, you have a child that's six years or older, if you're interested, you want to email jodyfriedman at rdfusa.com You know, just send her a letter to say hello.
Why don't you send her an email and say, hi, what's up, babe?
Or just go to abc.go.com slash primetime slash wife swap.
I hope one of our listeners gets to do this.
That would be far too exciting for me.
You should borrow a kid.
I wish I could.
Oh, Ranma says that was actually trading spouses.
The Fox version of the show was the God Warrior Lady.
The clip that I played was trading spouses.
Wife swap is the ABC version of the same fucking show.
Yeah.
Okay.
Super Nanny and Nanny 911.
Same fucking show, two different networks.
You should rent a child.
Yeah, you could borrow a child for like two weeks.
I might see if a co-worker has one you can borrow.
No.
Besides, I'd get some crazy bitches in my house throwing my shit away.
I don't need anyone to be doing that shit.
Actually, no, that's right, I would be there, so I would be able to monitor where she throws shit away.
No more playing games!
Fine, I can do that, you stupid whore!
You know they're going to get some World of Warcraft addict on the show.
Then you get some smart-ass kid that, you know, obviously, it's not your kid or whatever.
Yeah, that's my eight-year-old child.
They're going to get some fucking World of Warcraft addict who's going to start twitching the minute they're missing a Tuesday night raid.
They're going to start going into, like, and they're going to put him in, like, an Amish house.
And he's going to go, oh, actually, no, wait, it's wife swap, huh?
They're not going to put him, yeah, he's just going to stay there.
They should get a wife that's more addicted than him.
Yeah, they should get a, well, or whatever, whatever.
Nevermind, I guess it's not Husband Swap I'm just going to shut up and let the callers do the doing now Be funny!
Please be more funny than I am If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR That show they should let you sleep with the new wife Unless she's ugly, in which case you wouldn't want to touch that shit You're horrible 1-877-GAME-OLR Let's go to the phones, or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Woot, it's Nintendo Maniac 64 Hello Nintendo Maniac 64, what's on your mind?
Um, uh, oh, right now, I just gotta ask one little random question.
Do you know of anyone who actually doesn't use Windows XP or Vista other than, like, Mac and Linux and stuff?
Like, who uses something older?
People use any... Well, I mean, like, someone like me who's, like, a diehard Windows 2K addict.
I know people who use Palm OS I know people who still are on Windows 98 because they just don't feel like upgrading because all they use is the internet I know people who are still on Windows 3.11 My dad uses Windows ME and I have no idea why but he does I have a computer downstairs that still works with 3.11 in fact the PC I'm on right now is 98 Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
I had to have my computer replaced because my husband decided he was going to be nice and upgrade my computer from Windows 2000 to XP.
That's not upgrading.
Like I said, he thought that he was upgrading.
And it turned out that it completely fucked over my system.
I ended up having to have it anyway because I bought a VAIO.
Now my VAIO is starting to die and I'm just so sad about the day that I have to get a new computer with Vista on it.
Well, I have to ask another question.
Okay.
It was in the first part of the show, maybe it was like late second.
When you guys started talking about it was something, like there was a bunch of anime coming to something and then Loki started going...
raving about how awesome Akira was.
Okay, what's the anime for?
Is it coming to something?
Xbox Live Arcade, their movie series.
No, Xbox Live Video Marketplace.
Same fucking thing.
The Xbox Live thing.
Yeah, it's actually already there right now.
Okay, and third off, okay, I gotta have a mini rant.
Alright, make it quick.
I played it at a friend's house.
They had the custom controls.
It's like hacked
You can't map the weapon cycle to X or O. What the crap?
And you can't map it so that you can have turning and moving forward and back on the same analog stick.
Since I grew up in Goldeneye and stuff, that was the default control scheme and it's drilled in my head.
I gotta use that.
And they won't even let me change the individual axes.
Like, what the heck?
Boo in general to games that don't let you change the button configuration to whatever you like, no matter what it is.
Well, the thing is, it did let me change the buttons themselves, except that it wouldn't let me put Weapon Cycle onto X or O. That's strange.
I haven't played Resistance.
You guys have played it more than I have.
There's only one button for Weapon Cycle, and it's, I think, because... Well, all the buttons are analog, I guess, but for whatever reason...
I don't know, it's the R2 button, it's the one you do for weapons, so you either tap it, then it'll switch to the next one, or you hold it down and it'll allow you to switch which one you want.
I don't know, I love the, it seemed pretty straightforward to me, I just kept it on the default stuff, so.
I like it on the X or the O, kind of like where it'd be like on the A button, like the GameCube or the N64, like Goldeneye for example.
I suppose it's similar to like when I go, well, a couple years ago when I would go back and forth between Phantasy Star and Final Fantasy XI, they had the camera on completely different axes so that like when I went up and down and stuff, it would like totally mess with my head because it was all messed up.
Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac 64, thanks so much for the call and I hope you can get used to the controls in the game.
The way they are.
Yeah.
Well, I don't have a PS3, so that's perfectly fine.
It's more incentive for me not to get one.
You got it.
So never mind, then.
Have fun.
True, Sony.
Bye.
Bye.
All right.
If you would like to give us a call, it's Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
More phone calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Raven Stolfen.
Well, hello, Raven Stolfen.
What's on your mind, my friend?
Why do you sound analog?
I hate Skype 2.5.
You sound like you're on, like, an old-fashioned phone.
I'm sorry.
You kind of sound a little weird, too, but whatever.
We'll just have to deal.
What's on your mind?
It's the 2.5 thing.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
At least you're not breaking up or whatever.
What's on your mind?
Yeah, it's much clearer, but that sucks.
Oh, sorry for going on that little rant.
Mortal Kombat for Wii.
I was so tempted to buy this the other day, but I didn't.
What about it?
I played it, and I got to tell you something, it's a good Mortal Kombat game.
I was actually surprised that they did the Wii mode thing very well.
Is it easy to control?
Because that's the thing that holds me back.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, hell yeah.
Really?
It's super easy.
It doesn't look... You want to hear how easy?
Yeah.
You press down the B button, and you move it like a half moon, up and down, left and right, and you do the scorpion get over here real easy.
and Fatalities are just super easy.
You know what I do with Fatalities?
You just hold the button and swing it all around, see what happens?
Something like that.
You swing it, it's kind of like you swing it and then you press the little directional pad and it will do a Fatality.
That's how easy it is.
That sounds pretty fun.
How do you move the guy around the screen?
You just use the control pad on the Wiimote?
Can I just rant about the new Skype one?
The new Skype?
Yeah, 2.5, it has this really annoying ring thing, and it gets in your ear, and it's like, is this a new ring?
This sucks.
Yeah, that's just my voice that you're hearing.
That has nothing to do with Skype.
Back to games.
Back to games.
One more thing.
Yes, one more thing.
You got a black DS.
I sure did, a black DS Lite.
I was so close to getting the pink one, but then I decided that next time I go to New York, hopefully the engraving machine will be working and I can get it engraved.
And engravings show up much better on the black DS than it does on any of the other colors.
So in the end, I went for the black DS.
What I do want to get, though, is I'm going to get the little pink case with the sparkling little bling on it.
That's what I'm going to get to have my Princess Peach homage.
I'm so happy for you.
I got a black one, too, and I love it.
Yes, and I actually hear the black ones are usually bigger.
So I hear.
Yeah, all right, but that's just a rumor.
All right, anything else you want to add, Raven Stolven?
Don't download 2.5.
It sucks.
All right, I won't.
I'll hold that on the current Skype I have.
See you later, Raven Stolven.
Bye.
If you'd like to give us a call, the username is orangeentredo on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
You know who it is.
Static Man!
Jesus Christ.
It sounds like... Do you, like, put this on auto-dial or something, and then when we finally pick up, you, like, jump for the microphone?
Like, oh, shit.
I just use brute force.
I just, like, you know, hammer the line.
I'm guilty of that.
That's all right.
It was good to see you this weekend, Zaku, by the way.
Thanks for coming out.
You missed our trip to Astor Place in the video game store.
That's what we did after you left.
I know.
I had to play the store.
It just came out that weekend.
It's all good, buddy.
What's on your mind?
Let me see.
You already know that Rockstar is basically shifting more to the Microsoft side now that they've confirmed exclusive stuff for Grand Theft Auto 4.
Basically dispelling any chances of it showing up on the PS3 at all.
Yeah, I've heard... And they had the gall to say that the PS3 version would move consoles, which is just a load of bullshit, because if there's nothing beyond the regular game that the PS3 folks can attain, then what's the point of actually playing it?
Well, actually, this is Grand Theft Auto 4.
Yeah.
Rockstar confirmed it in their shareholders meeting.
It will move consoles because, oh wait, they don't have the episodic content either.
Yes, there we go.
That's exactly it.
Microsoft paid a good $50 million to keep it on their side.
I think it will just move consoles both for 360 and PS3.
How could you move consoles when one side doesn't have anything beyond the gameplay?
That's what I'm trying to get across to you.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That'll actually rumble the console when the game's played, you know?
Well, that has yet to be seen, but the bottom line is this.
Rockstar is basically leaning towards the side of, you know, it's basically the carrot and the stick.
The carrot, you know, the stick being Microsoft, the carrot being the money.
So they're looking at the numbers right now, and they're trying to get to, you know... What's this about a stick and a carrot?
It seems the 360 is something that, you know, they'll make a lot more money than...
and the PS3.
I guess that's the way it goes.
I guess so.
I guess that's the way it goes.
I just heard stick and a carrot.
Well, yeah, because Microsoft being the stick and then the carrot being the money.
Hey, DarkSakura, what do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?
My ass!
Alright.
What?
What?
Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference.
I haven't seen Kung Pao.
You are a loser.
All right, sorry, Zaku.
I'm sorry I couldn't keep everybody on topic.
But granted, I don't want to debate the Sony-Microsoft thing anymore.
But you have to look at the writing on the wall.
Rockstar is basically going to have to start leaning towards one side over another.
Regardless of what's already been done in the past, and by extending the game beyond the disc... It's just a crazy cycle.
The companies are going to release the game on the console that has the most number of machines in the market.
But the console that's going to have the most number of machines in the market is going to be the one that has the good games on it.
So it all comes down to first-party games.
It all comes down to the first-party games.
Exactly.
Rockstar knows that the 360 has a bigger install base than the PS3.
Granted that the 360 had a one year head start.
And, you know, they didn't blow, they didn't take it for granted.
So, yeah, this is going, you know, it's just that they're saying, you know, Rockstar is just bullshitting when they're saying that their version, their PS3 version of GTA 4 is actually going to move consoles.
We shall see what happens.
It's just, it doesn't make sense.
All right.
Well, thank you very much for the call, Zaku.
We've got to get some more calls.
Bye-bye.
All right.
See you.
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Some comments from chat room.
GS191 says, Shit, at the end of the day, Take-Two Interactive is going to make a shit ton of money anyway.
Note, buy their stock before Grand Theft Auto 4 release.
I hope the game tanks, just to piss you all off.
I don't care if it tanks.
I don't give a shit about their stock.
The game's going to be awesome.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hello, this is Dr. Gnar.
Hi, Dr. Gnar.
What's on your mind?
I just wanted to prove to all the other guys listening that you can actually get a coin if you try hard enough.
That's right.
You just got to keep hammering the line and you can get in.
Well, I'm glad you got it.
Have you called our show before?
No, I've never.
I just thought this is my second show listening live from Mexico City.
Welcome, we like the worldly listeners, that's always fun.
How's things going in Mexico City?
How's the gaming scene in a place like Mexico City?
Well, it's pretty much like Southern California, where I've been a ton of times.
And pretty much all you have to do is get a lot of games, and there's really not that many people playing live.
I have to play with a bunch of guys from the US, so that's why I'm here.
There you go.
Well, hey, you meet a lot of folks here who like to play with folks around the world.
It's good times.
What type of games have you been playing recently?
Sadly, not the kind of games that I like.
I like role-playing games, but there's not that many more out there.
So right now I'm pretty much playing shoot-'em-ups.
Shadowrun's been my latest failure.
You, like me, must be more excited about Eternal Sonata than Halo 3.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm married, I have a couple of kids, so it's a pretty interesting gaming scene.
Well, unfortunately, I don't think you could apply for the show because you're in another country, and I think that brings a whole other issue into it.
But you're saying you wouldn't trade your wife for anything?
No, and that's already given since both my kids are starting into video games, and they're only three and five.
Well, what kind of games are you letting the kids play?
Mostly Wii.
I got them a Wii, and I have a bunch of games.
for kids, basically anything rated E. I have Shrek, I have Monster Sync, that kind of games.
You know, there was this guy I ran into at Fry's the other day, and he was looking at the Wii games, and he overheard myself and I think Shane talking to each other about the different games, and he could tell that we kind of knew stuff about games.
So he actually came up and asked me, he's like, what would be a good Wii game for me to get for the family?
And I'm like, well, who's playing the Wii, you or the kids?
And he said kind of something for all of us.
So I recommended Elebits and WarioWare.
Was that a good suggestion?
I don't know.
I couldn't think...
Zelda is the best game on the Wii, but I don't know if young kids would really get into that so much.
So I said Elebits and WarioWare.
WarioWare is good.
Excite Truck.
Yeah.
Vice Cities.
That's your suggestion, right, Loki?
They don't have Vice City on the Wii.
Get Scarface!
Godfather!
No Scarface.
and the Trauma Center.
Get them started on the path to surgery early.
I said Trauma Center is a really fun game, but I don't think kids will play it.
I just like watching the patients bleed because I'm no good at it.
But you know, it's funny you said you wouldn't trade your wife for anything.
I wouldn't inflict my husband on anyone else.
That's nice.
There you go.
Well, Dr. Nahr, thanks so much for calling in.
We appreciate hearing from you.
And I don't know if they celebrate it in Mexico, but Happy Father's Day nonetheless.
Thank you.
That's it.
We have it too.
See you later.
Take care.
Thanks for calling.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Hey guys, it's Insanist.
Hello, Insanus.
I'm going insane just thinking about you.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Nothing.
You may all notice that I sound a lot like DMN when I'm not DMN.
Okay, so very well put.
Jamie took a PS3 and bludgeoned him to death.
It was a horrible funeral.
So you have officially retired or killed off DMN, and now we have Insanus instead.
Yes, I have.
That's your prerogative.
You know, Madonna wants everybody to call her Esther.
So you have every right.
And Prince wanted everybody to call him by that symbol.
I've called Madonna the same thing throughout her career, and that's a whore.
In Prince's defense, it had to do with the fact that his previous label owned the name Prince.
So he used the symbol in terms of protest until the contract was up and could get his thing again.
Has this show really come to discussing Prince?
He wore crocheted assless pants, and that's bravery.
This is what it sounds like when I cry.
So anyways, Rob, you need to explain something to your listeners.
Okay.
That you're not doing Orange Lounge Radio anymore.
I'm looking at this press release from CBS right here, and apparently you're the new host of The Price is Right.
I freaking wish.
will show perfectly for the new host of The Price is Right, and we will have somebody more feminine than Marker's Duties.
I don't know what to say, Insanist, but Plinko just moves me to tears.
No, however, I'm actually calling to raise some beef over the Church of England vs. Sony...
Sorry, I'm just playing a little bit of the Price is Right dance remix that I have.
Wait, let's get into the music.
See, I wanted to turn the Price is Right into a gay rave.
That's why I was not allowed to host it, sadly.
You just wanted those sparkling jackets.
Dude, Rod Roddy was the man.
Don't make fun of Rod Roddy.
I was actually going to call out the CBS executives and I'm just too fucking tired.
But I am up in arms over the Sony versus Church of England thing and how Sony is taking the whole thing.
Initially they weren't taking it seriously at all.
They were saying, oh, we're talking to the Church of England and Church of England was like, um, no.
No one's talking to us.
I think the Church of England's demands are a little bit harsh.
They want Resistance Fall of Man to be completely removed from the shelves and for them to completely redesign the level that the Church of Manchester is in.
I don't agree with that as much as I would love Sony to burn it out.
I would... It's kind of a... It's a high demand.
The Church of England has to understand that Sony is a business.
Um...
and they're saying, oh, likeness of a building, whatever.
Last I checked, I don't think buildings have likeness rights.
Yeah, and you know, isn't it kind of common to see famous landmarks in video games?
I mean, how many games are out there that involve the White House?
You know, or like in that alien shooting game, what was it, Destroy All Humans?
You could blow up the White House, you know?
Or how about all the movies out there that have New York City being destroyed?
Well, but usually, though, in a lot of those, you're getting the permits to shoot at those locations.
But I guess not always, because sometimes they shoot in Canada and make it look like the U.S.
Certain landmarks, they do that.
It's a fictional game that takes place in a fictional future that...
I agree the church has somewhat of their panties in a bunch, but it wouldn't pain Sony to go, look, sorry we pissed you off.
Our bad, but we're not going to recall the game.
Bill, sorry that you're offended by this.
Fuck off.
What would you like to see happen as a resolution, Insanist?
I would just like to see the church of England saying, oh, well, you should donate some money to a gun control education fund, because
Those of you who aren't aware, Manchester, England had a horrible, horrible gun problem.
I want to say a month and a half, two months ago, a 15-year-old kid was killed with a mistaken identity.
It was a gun crime.
The kid got killed execution style.
It was not something you like reading.
Well, then that's very unfortunate, and that sounds like a very fair resolution as well.
Sony donates a little money to charity, all is well.
Kiss and make up.
Yeah.
That's about it on that.
I would like to plug The Insanest Hour.
It's not STFU.
It's me making fun of stuff and swearing for an hour and playing music.
And there you go, Ashley.
And we should say it here on the show.
This all kind of went down while I was out of town and while the rest of the hosts were on vacation.
But STFU finally did, unfortunately.
So we're sad to see it go, but that's all right.
It was over things with my employer, who, as I've been adamant, will remain nameless.
I was actually going to come next week.
I had things come down where the checkbook said no.
I know.
It's, you know, money happens.
No, it's okay.
I think we're at a point now where we're actually going to have no guests, and that's kind of how we're going to do it.
It's just going to be the three of us next week.
But I'll tell you more about what's going to happen next week a little later in the show.
Well, fine.
Why don't you just act like you're better than everybody and clamp yourself in your stupid orange lounge room and do your own radio show for your fifth year anniversary and not share it with anybody else?
Oh, wait, you're going to hit it with the radio.
Yeah, I'll do that, actually.
And you know how else I can assert that I'm better than you, Insanist?
You're about to hang up on me?
Yep.
All right.
If you want to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
We'll do one more call.
I'm such a dick.
But it's Insanist or DMN or whatever.
The symbol.
He should have a symbol there.
Whatever you want to call him.
From now on, his name is Swirly Polka Dots.
Swirly Polka Dots.
Sega Swirl is his new name, actually.
Sega Swirl.
We're not actually getting any more calls, it looks like.
So maybe that's it.
I got a private message from Insanus.
Oh, I got a heart.
I got less than three.
Yay.
All right, well then I guess that's it since no more calls are coming in.
We'll go ahead and close up the Skype line.
We had a lot of calls tonight anyway.
I just thought I saw some other numbers popping up, but they must have stopped trying.
So that's about it.
We're going to wrap things up.
Let's go around and first ask if there's any last minute stories.
Anything last minute that wants to be brought up tonight.
Loki, you usually have something.
Yes, I do.
Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out.
Diablo is getting a movie.
What the hell?
Apparently, Legendary Pictures, their website is listing Diablo movie as in development.
As well as a Clash of the Titans remake Oh lord Will they have the really bad dubbing like the first one?
And the World of Warcraft film Excellent Let's see what else Then again, Legendary Pictures did the new Batman, didn't they?
Yeah, I think so That was like a pretty fucking rad movie This may not be the end of the world Well, with the Halo 3 beta ending Something else had to take its place, right?
Going outside?
Halo 3's viral marketing campaign has taken its place.
And move over, I Love Bees, and welcome Adjundant Reflex.
And it's apparently this weird viral marketing campaign that they have going on, including people staying in the street with signs and websites with calendars and whatnot.
So if you want more info on that,
Why are they standing in the street with signs?
The people that are waiting for Halo 3 are playing Gears of War while they're waiting.
They're not outside.
This is part of the viral marketing campaign.
Ace Combat 6 is getting a limited edition flight stick bundle that's going to be coming out.
Bandai and Hori are teaming up to release it's going to have this really elaborate flight stick which I'm unaware of works for any other game other than Ace Combat 6 so
Matt Cosimani from...
IGN posted a while back about Halo on the DS.
Well, apparently in their latest podcast, they said, It's a real game.
We're going to lay down some ownage next week or soon afterwards, showing you guys that it's a real game.
So IGN will probably have info about Halo DS soon.
What the hell?
My thoughts exactly.
Who cares?
I mean, like, they're, like, I don't know, to me, the way you read that, and I don't know if that's the way you post it or if you belch or whatever, but it sounds like they're, like, kind of just, like, they're, like, we've got a big cock because we knew that Halo was really on the DS and we're going to prove it.
I mean, who cares?
If the game never came out, I mean, what, I'm supposed to look at, like, oh, look how this game was almost, like, completely bastardized.
Well, in other news, there was a video of Diablo for the Game Boy online.
I heard about that.
You know, whatever.
All right.
Uh, DarkSakura, you have anything last minute?
I'm sorry, is this show not living up to your expectations tonight?
I've had a headache most of the show.
Is this just, oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Somebody screamed in my ear, both of you.
Take two of these.
Ah, Nuprin.
Little.
Yellow.
Different.
You did the Wayne's World reference version, didn't you?
Because the other one was Little Yellow Different Better.
Was the real commercial.
Anyhow.
Beer

So for part B, we're going to get out the dinner table like we're at Denny's or whatever diner.
Let's order some pizza.
Let's order pizza.
And we're going to open up the Skype line and we're going to have you guys call in and just talk shit with us for a few hours about games and everything.
And if you guys want to pass on your congratulations, that's cool too.
Whatever you want to do for, you know, it's going to be your show.
Man, I remember the first show though.
I know, some good times.
I was in this chair, passed out with a migraine.
And the second show, man, that was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room.
And Pat Charisse was in chat and says, yay, we can hear the same three people for an hour.
Well, we're hoping that that won't happen.
We're actually kind of hoping that maybe some folks might drop in on the Skype line that you wouldn't expect.
So who knows?
We're hoping to get some callers we may not usually get on the program.
That's what we're looking at for next week.
We should get Scott on the Skype.
That would be funny.
Possibly.
I mean, who knows who's going to call in next week.
So...
We'll see.
We're going to put the call out there, but we do want our listeners to get in on it, too, because even those folks that have, even the same three people that always call in, definitely make this show a part of what it is.
So if you've never listened live before and you want to get in, next week is an excellent chance to do that.
Again, we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our live 365 station.
More information can be found at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
I do know that next week's discussion will be quite interesting.
After all, we are getting close to E3.
Are you saying that even though you got slapped on the wrist about something a while ago, possibly next week, you're going to spill some big-ass beans?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Maybe?
Thinking about it?
It's crossed my mind.
Crossed your mind?
Stay tuned.
That could be fun.
All right.
Anyhow, we're going to wrap it up for this week.
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Explicit, sorry we didn't have a fourth mic or something so you can get in on the action more often, but we appreciate you being here as always.
It's all good.
And again, keep it up with the Wii cosplay and whatever other creative cosplays you come up with.
It'll show up on Anime Expo and SAC Anime as well.
Awesome.
When is SAC Anime?
It's July 13th through the 15th.
We want to make an appearance somehow.
I'm going to be there.
I'm actually staffed there now.
Can we do a panel or something?
Yeah, get us a panel.
I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to the management.
Tell them you know internet celebrities.
I'll talk to them about it.
Don't lie.
They trust me a lot now.
Alright, sounds good.
Don't abuse it.
Exactly.
Want to ruin your rep real fast?
No, no, no.
I have a good rep.
I have a good rep with people.
This is really, really disgusting.
Alright, I know.
Loki.
Loki.
Your final thought.
And it smells bad.
Stay tuned for the afterbirth.
That's my final thought.
If you're listening live, otherwise you're screwed.
DarkSakura?
I feel really stupid because I deleted almost everything out of my FTP, including the banner for my live journal, so I have to go home and re-upload it.
The via was dying, so in three days my computer that was given to me by Vandalus is going to be up and running, and I need to think of a clever name for it.
My final thought is now I want ice cream.
I didn't want ice cream a couple hours ago, but now I do.
I have chocolate mint pudding at home.
Sounds good.
All right.
