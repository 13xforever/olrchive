Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, the 17th of June, 2007.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Happy Father's Day again to those of you folks that are gamer daddies.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
We're going to get back into the gaming news.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Remember Orange Lounge Radio is released in two parts.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
And if you haven't listened to part A, you missed a lot tonight.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
So please go back to wherever you got this show and make sure you've tuned in to part A.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Let's continue on with tonight's program.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
And I'm going to start us off with some more gaming news in this segment.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
We talked a lot about PlayStation 3 and a little bit about computer games.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
Started to dip into Xbox a little bit in the last segment.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
We didn't really mention the Wii a whole lot.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
But I do want to talk about Madden 2008.

00:55.000 --> 01:02.000
And we don't talk a whole lot about sports games on this program because everybody likes their different genres.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Some of them are role-playing games.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
We don't play a lot of sports games.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
But some of these interesting new features in Madden 2008 are worth mentioning.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
And I want to talk about the friend codes system and kind of one of the bummers about Madden 2008.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
IGN recently interviewed the associate producer of Madden 08, Damien Zur.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And he's talked about that the game is not actually going to be using the friend codes.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
You know how you've been collecting the Wii friend codes so you can trade Miis across the internet and stuff like that?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Madden 08 is not going to use that.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Quote, Madden Wii doesn't support the Wii's friend system during online play.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
This is something we're still working on with Nintendo.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
For now, our online play uses your EA Nation persona to search and manage your EA Messenger account.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
So now you're going to have to balance this whole other thing.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
But what?

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
What if this is something that they're going to support through all their EA games?

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Which is fine then if they're going to do that.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
As long as it's not...

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
I mean, you can call their friend code whatever you want.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
If you've got to enter one in for each game, who gives a shit?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
I mean...

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I just kind of wish Nintendo would just wake up and say...

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Because they're saying that we're having problems with Nintendo.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Why is Nintendo holding back on this stuff?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
That's obviously what's going on here.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Nintendo's done this with the DS.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
They held back on so much of what the DS actually had in it.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
They didn't launch DS online until a year and a half after the system was out.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
And then there was also the whole microphone and the voice chatting is just now happening.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't know if Nintendo likes to time release the features of their system to make it last longer or what the deal is.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
But it's weird.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I thought it was more technical issues.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
What's that? Explicit?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I thought it was more technical issues.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
I don't know, but it just seems to me like you're not seeing any online games.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
I don't think it's because no one wants to do it.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
I think it's because Nintendo's kind of keeping some secrets down or something like that.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Bandit in the chatroom says,

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
Online play doesn't start until Nintendo says so and the next gen doesn't start until Sony says so.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
SSJ100Matt being very random in our chatroom.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
chat.orangelandradio.com

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Dear Nintendo, bring back the Game Boy printer.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Well, knowing Nintendo, maybe there will be something to attach it to later.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
To print out your Mii or something like that.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
RossdielUT brings up a good point.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
EA could easily just say,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
No Madden for the Wii unless you stop with the friend codes.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't know though.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
Wii is selling pretty good to an audience that may not necessarily have a 360.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
So I think you still want to get Madden out to that audience somehow.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't know.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Well Madden Wii is going to get some other funny features in there as well.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
Including some mini games, Mii integration, and the ability to draw on the screen.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Unless you two can be just like John Madden and draw on the screen.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
With the brand new Wii Illustrator.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
So that's kind of funny.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
And of course like FIFA and some of the other games that are coming out.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
You will be able to integrate your Mii in there.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
There are going to have a whole set of mini games.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Kind of similar I'm guessing to Madden 07.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
You know, just field training and what not.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Okay, so you can sketch all over the board like it was real football and everything.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
But the $64,000 question is, will you be able to write out boobs on the prompt on the little thing?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I think you can.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
How very un-Nintendo like.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
What's that explicit?

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Then again, Nintendo is supposed to be releasing a child porn game for the DS.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
What?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
No, no, no.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
That is Namco.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Or SNK.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm sorry.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
SNK.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
The only new game that they're putting out was that stupid touch the witches thing to

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
see if they're witches and you flick their boobs and shit.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
What in the fuck are you talking about?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Maybe you should read some more Kotaku or something.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
There's at least one story about this damn game.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Give me a break.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
There's like 50,000 game blogs out there I'm trying to juggle.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
It's a Japanese game where you have to find witches.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
And the only way to find witches are to poke and prod at them on their body.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
And one of the witches happens to be a little boy.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
Wasn't there like a cat or something too?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I don't know.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
It's just weird.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.660
But yes, at one point you do touch little boys in that game, so that's weird.

05:15.660 --> 05:19.000
But there's a lot of touching of women and you flick their boobs and stuff.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm poking Jamie to see if she's a witch right now, actually.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.600
She's about ready to break her bottle.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
I beard you.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
I beard you.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.600
Wow.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.600
Jamie does not like to be poked and declared a witch.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.600
And Madden 08 will be online.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.600
We found a witch.

05:36.600 --> 05:37.600
May we burn her?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
Of course.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
Burn the witch.

05:39.600 --> 05:45.800
They're going to have a two-on-two versus mode as well for the mini-games, so that's

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
kind of cool.

05:46.800 --> 05:51.320
Madden 2008, featuring hot two-on-two action.

05:51.320 --> 05:56.440
So I have some happy news, like none of us didn't see this coming.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.680
The Wii and the DS are outselling their Sony counterparts with a vengeance.

06:01.680 --> 06:10.960
There have been 338,000 units sold in May, which is more than both the 155,000 Xbox 360s

06:10.960 --> 06:12.960
and 82,000 PS3s put together.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.680
Isn't that cool?

06:15.680 --> 06:17.160
Not if you're a Sony fanboy.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.600
You're kind of mad at this right now.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.900
I mean, again, I try to be as impartial as possible, but let me say this news does not

06:22.900 --> 06:24.680
surprise me.

06:24.680 --> 06:32.080
Well, the top-selling game right now is Pokemon Diamond, and it actually was followed by Mario

06:32.080 --> 06:36.960
Party 8 and, dear God, why anyone would want the Spider-Man 3 game, because it wasn't all

06:36.960 --> 06:40.160
that good, and Pokemon Pearl.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.360
And Wii Play was on number five, so isn't that cool?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.360
Not really, because the game kind of blows.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.360
So guess what?

06:46.360 --> 06:47.360
What?

06:47.360 --> 06:51.280
The same thing is happening in Japan, like any of us are surprised.

06:51.280 --> 06:58.160
So dear Sony, bite our asses, not love me.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.540
Someone's a little bitter over Sony right now.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.540
What's up with this?

07:01.540 --> 07:03.380
Why all of a sudden Sony angst?

07:03.380 --> 07:07.320
You weren't swayed by anything you heard about the agency in Part A or-

07:07.320 --> 07:08.320
No.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.320
Okay.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.320
Parappa?

07:10.320 --> 07:11.320
No?

07:11.320 --> 07:12.320
Silent Hill 5?

07:12.320 --> 07:13.320
Parappa!

07:13.320 --> 07:16.280
Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction is going to be awesome.

07:16.280 --> 07:22.200
Well, one thing that apparently is not so awesome is Project Hammer, or Project H-A-M-M-E-R,

07:22.200 --> 07:23.200
if you will.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.120
You might remember that this game was being shown actually at last year's E3 when they

07:27.120 --> 07:28.280
originally debuted the Wii.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.320
In fact, they had it playable on some workstations.

07:31.320 --> 07:37.080
However, some sources are reporting that Project Hammer has been canceled.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.480
IGN was reporting it a little earlier this week.

07:39.480 --> 07:46.520
The team has moved on supposedly to look at some more expanded audience projects, whatever

07:46.520 --> 07:49.680
that is supposed to mean.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.920
Hopefully it's something original no matter what it is, but there it is.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.480
Nintendo, by the way, has not released an official statement, but some folks have kind

07:56.480 --> 08:00.760
of seen this coming for a little while because Project Hammer went into this mysterious T-B-A

08:00.760 --> 08:06.160
status on its website, and it has yet to move from that status.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.160
So there you go.

08:07.160 --> 08:11.920
It was supposed to be a very interesting plot where you had a hammer-wielding cyborg and

08:11.920 --> 08:15.360
you're protecting the U.S. from killer robots.

08:15.360 --> 08:20.160
However, as silly as it might sound, it looked like the game was actually supposed to be

08:20.160 --> 08:21.160
kind of fun.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.960
I watched some people play it at E3, and it definitely didn't look like anything else

08:23.960 --> 08:27.200
on Nintendo's system, so it's kind of weird that they would just kind of up and up cancel

08:27.200 --> 08:31.800
this game, but I guess if it sucked, good for them for pulling the plug on it before

08:31.800 --> 08:34.520
they actually released it and got all the bad press, I guess.

08:34.520 --> 08:38.920
I think you should have had MC Hammer do the voice for Project Hammer, because that would

08:38.920 --> 08:39.920
have been so appropriate.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.280
Yeah, well, you can't touch this game now.

08:42.280 --> 08:43.280
It's been canceled, actually.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.240
Hammer, don't let him hurt you.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.400
Did either of you guys see this at E3 last year when we were all there?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
Yeah, I remember Project Hammer.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
You remember that?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.400
I think they still had it on the website, on Nintendo's website.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.400
Well, it's just a rumor.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.360
It's not officially canceled, but all signs point to...

08:57.360 --> 08:58.360
I don't know.

08:58.360 --> 09:03.720
I know just working in the retail and distribution side, there's a lot of things that go canceled

09:03.720 --> 09:05.280
for a while and come back.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.760
It's just because they're not working on it right now, kind of shelving it for a while.

09:09.760 --> 09:14.080
Maybe they'll just decide to release it as a downloadable title on Nintendo Live Arcade.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
Oh, wait.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
They don't have that.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.200
Okay, the game I was talking about earlier was Doki Doki Majo Shimpan, and there's a

09:20.200 --> 09:23.280
perfect example of the things that you poke in the game.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.280
Pompoms?

09:24.280 --> 09:25.280
Yeah, pom-poms.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.280
Anyways.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.280
Interesting.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.280
So...

09:28.280 --> 09:33.480
Thank you, Loki, for bringing down the maturity level of this show to a whole new low.

09:33.480 --> 09:34.480
Appreciate it.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.480
No problem.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.920
Just real quick, some chat comments from chat room.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.480
Rama says, Project Hammer was designed to show how much of a powerhouse the Wii is.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.320
Did you see the graphics on it?

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
Interesting.

09:44.320 --> 09:49.420
Yeah, it didn't look that bad, considering that the Wii just simply isn't as powerful

09:49.420 --> 09:51.400
as the other systems.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.040
Well, there you go.

09:55.040 --> 10:07.480
Another interesting game coming out to the DS is going to have these two little kind

10:07.480 --> 10:12.080
of cute stylus drum things, I guess, for it, so you're going to be able to beat the screen

10:12.080 --> 10:14.480
like a taiko drum.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.480
Aren't the styluses kind of already drumsticks?

10:16.480 --> 10:17.480
I mean, how...

10:17.480 --> 10:22.360
Yeah, but it's two of them now, so you have two of them that you can drum the screen with.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.920
But your DS actually comes with two styluses.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.960
They give you a spare in there, and yet you still lose these little bastards everywhere.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.760
Maybe if, yeah, maybe if you're like my wife and lost, you know, the stylus, you know.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.760
Whatever, who cares?

10:35.760 --> 10:38.200
You get another, you get two free styluses with it.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.200
That's awesome.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.840
So you can play this game once, because that's what always happens with these type of games,

10:42.840 --> 10:44.600
with the special peripherals and stuff.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.560
Very rare, well, I guess that's not true, because DDR I've played to death, but some

10:48.560 --> 10:51.000
of these other music games I play once and I'm done.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.440
If you're going to be buying this in Japan, have you know the styluses aren't free.

10:56.440 --> 11:00.960
They actually drove the cost of the game up about a thousand more yen, so.

11:00.960 --> 11:01.960
Which is what?

11:01.960 --> 11:02.960
Ten more dollars?

11:02.960 --> 11:07.980
Basically is what that translates to, about ten more dollars for two extra stylus things

11:07.980 --> 11:09.680
that are drumsticks, but not...

11:09.680 --> 11:10.680
You just figure.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.680
Yeah.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.680
I know.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.680
Why can't you just use your fingernails?

11:13.680 --> 11:14.680
Maybe that's not good for a screen.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.040
Or why can't you just use one stylus?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.320
Or why not just play a real drum?

11:19.320 --> 11:23.240
No, just, actually Taiko no Tatachin is kind of fun.

11:23.240 --> 11:24.880
Taiko Drum Master, whatever you want to call it.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.800
I don't know, but it's fun when you actually have the big old drum on it.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.120
But then again, just like Donkey Konga, I played it once and then I was kind of done

11:32.120 --> 11:33.120
with it.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.120
So, whatever.

11:34.120 --> 11:39.000
Well, you know, there is something that a bunch of us have played several times, I'm

11:39.000 --> 11:44.100
sure, if we had any real video game taste, which those of us in this room do.

11:44.100 --> 11:54.800
So wonderfully, it is now Europe's Virtual Console's 100th game, F-Zero X, which is like

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
freaking rad.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.960
I remember playing a ton of F-Zero X.

11:58.960 --> 11:59.960
You know what's funny?

11:59.960 --> 12:02.600
F-Zero X is the one F-Zero game I didn't play.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.600
What?

12:03.600 --> 12:04.600
I know.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.320
I played the one on the Super Nintendo, definitely the GameCube one, which was so underrated.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.720
F-Zero X was like hotness.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.240
Well, maybe they'll release it here.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.560
Maybe that's a good sign that it's coming here.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.840
I can come to my house and play it on my Nintendo 64.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.080
You're actually going to hook that shit up just so we can play F-Zero X?

12:17.080 --> 12:18.080
If I can find it, I will.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.080
All right, it's a date.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.320
I'll hook it up on my Nintendo 64.

12:20.320 --> 12:25.000
Oh, that's right, I threw mine away in a dumpster.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.080
I still have my Nintendo 64 in a box somewhere.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.320
I can't find my Dreamcast, though.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.800
I have all the accessories for the Dreamcast.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.080
I think I'm missing a box.

12:32.080 --> 12:36.480
I also have a Dreamcast sitting in a box over there that's not being used.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.160
I want to use it as a Nintendo emulator.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.680
Play some Guardian Legend again.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.920
But of course, maybe I don't need to be using my Dreamcast as an emulator much longer.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.420
Not if I get one of these.

12:47.420 --> 12:52.320
You may have read about this, but there is a new Power Pack compact flash system.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.120
This is pretty rad because it looks just like an old-school Nintendo cartridge, but it's

12:56.120 --> 12:58.240
red and it's see-through.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.500
What it is, it's a flash cartridge.

13:00.500 --> 13:05.480
What you can do, you can actually store multiple ROMs on a compact flash card and then actually

13:05.480 --> 13:11.240
put them on this cartridge and play pirated old-school Nintendo games to your heart's

13:11.240 --> 13:12.240
content.

13:12.240 --> 13:17.960
And it will only cost you $135 if you get one of these things.

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
But that's not bad.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.840
I mean, for some people, that's how much they're going to spend on virtual console games when

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
you add it all up.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.840
But what I love about this is they actually gave it the very retro look here.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.480
They actually kind of put a little...

13:28.480 --> 13:31.560
It looks like an old-school Nintendo game, if you see a picture of the box.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.640
And even with this little rip-off Nintendo seal of approval there.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.680
Well, it better for $135!

13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
Shit!

13:37.680 --> 13:44.840
Well, I mean, compact flash readers are not exactly cheap pieces of equipment and the

13:44.840 --> 13:45.840
whole thing.

13:45.840 --> 13:50.600
We were joking, myself and my wife were joking, because we saw another one of those iPhone

13:50.600 --> 13:52.720
commercials that they have on TV.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.360
This isn't just the internet for phone.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.400
This isn't scaled down internet.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.400
This is the real internet.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.480
I'm like, it better be the fucking real internet for $600!

14:03.480 --> 14:05.960
And then she's like, you should say that about every feature on it.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.960
I'm like, yeah, it better fucking be for $600!

14:08.960 --> 14:10.840
There's lots of people waiting for their iPhones.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.840
I know this.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.840
Well, shit!

14:12.840 --> 14:18.760
It better be everything that they promise it will be because it's $600!

14:18.760 --> 14:30.320
So apparently the AMA is debating on whether to recognize game addiction as a real addiction.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.840
So yeah, they're going to be debating about it.

14:32.840 --> 14:38.400
And looking at all the facts and sooner or later we will have something for someone to

14:38.400 --> 14:43.620
talk about saying, hey, game addiction's real, see?

14:43.620 --> 14:45.040
It's just like alcoholism.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.820
It's a disease.

14:46.820 --> 14:51.160
How exactly does one go about debating game addiction?

14:51.160 --> 14:53.120
Fucking fine though.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.120
I don't know.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.880
Exploring the possible dangers of excessive video game playing that's over two hours

14:58.880 --> 14:59.880
a day.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.880
Would you like to have a debate?

15:01.880 --> 15:03.580
Oops!

15:03.580 --> 15:10.260
Would you like to have a debate about gaming addiction right now?

15:10.260 --> 15:14.200
Okay, who would like to take the point there is no such thing as gaming addiction?

15:14.200 --> 15:17.120
Would anyone like to take the anti-point, there is no such thing as gaming addiction?

15:17.120 --> 15:19.600
Would anyone like to do that?

15:19.600 --> 15:23.480
Okay, Jamie will take the anti-point, there is no such thing as gaming addiction.

15:23.480 --> 15:28.980
Okay, who would like to take the pro-point, there is such thing as gaming addiction?

15:28.980 --> 15:30.120
Fine.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.120
You will?

15:31.120 --> 15:33.120
Alright, that'll be interesting.

15:33.120 --> 15:37.120
Alright, Loki will take the point that there is a such thing as gaming addiction.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.120
Okay, here we go.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.120
Loki, opening statement.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.120
Korea, World of Warcraft, dead babies.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.120
Alright, that was a very nice opening statement, thank you.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.120
Dark Sakura, rebuttal to the opening statement.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.120
Obsessive compulsive disorder.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.120
Where are you going with this, exactly?

15:54.120 --> 15:58.120
These people don't have addiction to gaming, they're obsessive compulsive.

15:58.120 --> 16:02.120
And gaming just happens to be the object of their disorder.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.120
Loki, rebuttal.

16:04.120 --> 16:09.120
Okay, well still though, that's technically game addiction, they're addicted to games.

16:09.120 --> 16:15.120
I mean, with OCD or whatever, they're not like, you know, drinking tons of alcohol.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.120
They're not, you know, gambling or anything like that.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.120
Gambling is also obsessive compulsive.

16:21.120 --> 16:31.120
True, these are all, okay, well, I can have lung cancer or I can have cancer but it doesn't mean it's necessarily lung cancer or not necessarily, you know, from smoking or something.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
Are you saying games give you cancer?

16:33.120 --> 16:39.120
Addiction, I think, requires ingestion of a particular substance that your body eventually becomes dependent upon.

16:39.120 --> 16:49.120
Having a physical thing that you are obsessively compulsive to participate in is not the same as a physical addiction.

16:49.120 --> 16:57.120
It's just that by doing this task over and over again, your brain chemicals are saying, hey, I like this and I want to keep doing this.

16:57.120 --> 17:09.120
As opposed to you actually having a physical addiction to a substance that your body is starting to need to maintain a particular level of normalcy, I guess.

17:09.120 --> 17:13.120
So you're basically saying World of Warcraft is not an injectable substance.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.120
Right.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.120
Rebuttal.

17:15.120 --> 17:21.120
How many weekends have you skipped going out with friends and stuff to play World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI?

17:21.120 --> 17:24.120
You're pointing at me and like maybe one.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.120
Because he knows that I haven't done it.

17:26.120 --> 17:28.120
When I was sad and fat.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.120
If you're going to point at me or like, you know.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.120
You're not sad anymore.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.120
You just lost the debate, bitch, you insulted the ref.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.120
Loki is the winner, ladies and gentlemen.

17:39.120 --> 17:42.120
I leave it to the chat room to vote.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.120
Chat room vote.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.120
Remember, our opinions don't matter.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.120
It's the chat room's vote.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.120
Loki, anything else you wish to add, in all seriousness?

17:50.120 --> 17:59.120
No, seriously, you know, gaming addiction as something that needs to be treated or something, that's retarded.

17:59.120 --> 18:03.120
Fucking parents need to step in and just fucking say, stop playing your damn games.

18:03.120 --> 18:07.120
Or if you're older, just have your girlfriend say, stop playing your damn games.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.120
Which is what you have.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.120
I put them on drugs for OCD.

18:11.120 --> 18:16.120
That's how Loki curbed his gaming addiction, is he married a woman that will pull the plug on.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.120
I still play two hours of games a day, if that, more than that.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.120
Okay, then what's my excuse?

18:22.120 --> 18:31.120
I was a massive gamer, married my husband, and now at heart I don't really play that much anymore except for pinball.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.120
He still plays more than I do.

18:33.120 --> 18:37.120
I don't care, he's welcome to as long as he leaves me alone.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.120
Well, there's going to be another kiss with Jack Thompson about this.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.120
Eh, eh, eh, eh, no.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.120
He who shall not be named.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.120
Oh, explicit hasn't been here in a year.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.120
He doesn't know about some of our banning topics.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.120
We do not mention his name in these circles.

18:52.120 --> 18:57.120
That's right, it's actually codenamed Lord Voldemort, is actually what we refer to him as on the show.

18:57.120 --> 19:01.120
So whenever you hear Lord Voldemort, that's JT, okay?

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
Alright, you got it.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.120
Oh, we got explicit.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.120
It's okay, G4 was banned too, but somebody else brought it up earlier.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.120
Leave it to Loki to bring that up, so there you go.

19:08.120 --> 19:13.120
There you go, GS191 sums it up.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
Well, there's your cure.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
Marriage cures gaming addiction.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.120
Examples, Loki and Dark Soccer.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
No, it doesn't.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.120
I still play.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.120
I was never addicted.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.120
Because there's no such thing as gaming addiction.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.120
I'm not addicted to games.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
It's like this, okay?

19:26.120 --> 19:34.120
My wife doesn't like the fact that I talk about games a lot because, well, I work in the games industry,

19:34.120 --> 19:43.120
I play games, I do this show, so I'm talking about work, my outside stuff, what I'm doing,

19:43.120 --> 19:48.120
and unfortunately that all comes back to games because it all has something to do with games, usually.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.120
I talk about movies though, a lot about movies and Transformers.

19:51.120 --> 19:59.120
But still though, it's just, I think people have addictive behavior,

19:59.120 --> 20:02.120
but these people, if games weren't around, they'd be addicted to something else.

20:02.120 --> 20:08.120
So whatever, just fucking be responsible people.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.120
That's what people need to do.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.120
All right.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.120
It's all done.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.120
The debate's over.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.120
Jamie already lost because she made fun of the ref.

20:15.120 --> 20:19.120
Rob, I do that all the time.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.120
It's because I love you.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.120
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.120
Well, here's the segment I love most of all, and it's the one where we get to hear from our listeners,

20:25.120 --> 20:29.120
and I'm sure we've collected quite a bit of mail over the past two weeks because we had no live show last week.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.120
So we're going to open up the mailbag, and whenever you want to email us,

20:32.120 --> 20:35.120
you can always send an email to mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.

20:35.120 --> 20:39.120
Dark Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first, wearing some latex gloves though,

20:39.120 --> 20:41.120
so she doesn't get anthrax or anything,

20:41.120 --> 20:44.120
and pull out some of her favorite emails to share with us here on the show.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.120
We call it the OLR mailbag.

20:46.120 --> 20:50.120
Dark Sakura, who emailed us this week?

20:50.120 --> 20:57.120
Some people, a bunch of people, and I'm not reading all these fucking emails, so I'll just start here.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.120
This one comes from Ospher.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.120
Hey, it's Ospher again.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.120
I swear I wasn't drunk, Ospher.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.120
Hey, shush.

21:05.120 --> 21:11.120
Since I lack a high-speed connection, I always have to go to a friend's house and wirelessly download your podcast to my PSP.

21:11.120 --> 21:15.120
It's been a few weeks since I last listened to this show, so I downloaded all that I could up to the current podcast.

21:15.120 --> 21:19.120
In an episode a few weeks ago, I found it hilarious that Rob called his mom.

21:19.120 --> 21:24.120
We got to find out some things that we never knew about him, like how he dressed up as Courtney Love and lip synced.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.120
Do we really have to bring that up again?

21:25.120 --> 21:29.120
Good lord, you guys should find a video and upload it to the site if you can.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.120
We are not retelling the story for your benefit explicitly.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.120
Go download the podcast. There's still others.

21:34.120 --> 21:38.120
One week there should be a Parents of OLR show where you all call your parents or bring them on the show.

21:38.120 --> 21:42.120
I'm sure some more interesting things should be revealed about you guys.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.120
Anyway, thanks for reading.

21:44.120 --> 21:49.120
If we got my mom out here, that would be great because I want to get my mom to California.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.120
For me, it was kind of like a one-time joke.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.120
Sequels are never as good as the original.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.120
It was kind of like a one-time joke.

21:54.120 --> 21:57.120
That was the Mother's Day show, by the way, where that happened.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.120
There you have it.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.120
No, but that was good.

22:00.120 --> 22:06.120
My mom did great on the show, considering she had no idea we were calling her live.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.120
She did a great job, so I was very proud of her.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.120
So the next email.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.120
Dun, dun, dun.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.120
If you're ready.

22:14.120 --> 22:17.120
Hey, you noticed that person again, but this is great.

22:17.120 --> 22:22.120
And now I give you ten random questions spurred from my void of boredom.

22:22.120 --> 22:24.120
This is Ocifer again.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.120
I still am not drunk, Ocifer, I swear.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.120
One, freeze.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.120
What are you all doing right now at this moment?

22:29.120 --> 22:30.120
The fucking show?

22:30.120 --> 22:31.120
Yeah, we're doing a radio show.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.120
Actually, Loki is not doing a radio show.

22:33.120 --> 22:38.120
I can clearly see, plain as day, Loki is playing on some Transformers-related website

22:38.120 --> 22:39.120
and not paying attention to the mailbag.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.120
Now, now, this is game-related.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.120
This is the opening cinematic for Transformers the game.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.120
So, huh.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.120
And I'm paying attention.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.120
I just got served.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.120
Two.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
Okay, you can move now.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.120
What is the drink that helps you get up and go?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.120
Coffee.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.120
Tea.

22:54.120 --> 22:59.120
Loki stacking Pepsi cans over there.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.120
Honestly, water.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
Or coffee.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.120
If I need caffeine, coffee.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.120
Otherwise, I drink a crap load of water.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.120
But tonight, it's Malibu and root beer.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.120
Which isn't as bad of a combination as you might think.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.120
How many questions?

23:12.120 --> 23:14.120
Wait, this is ten random questions you said?

23:14.120 --> 23:16.120
Alright, oh boy, it's only a three-hour show.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.120
Let's keep it moving.

23:17.120 --> 23:22.120
What is the capital of Germany?

23:22.120 --> 23:23.120
Wiener schnitzel.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.120
Four.

23:24.120 --> 23:28.120
What is your favorite song on either BeatMania 2DX or DDR?

23:28.120 --> 23:30.120
No, the Germany question still bugging me.

23:30.120 --> 23:33.120
It was the city that was separated for so long.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.120
Berlin.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.120
Berlin?

23:35.120 --> 23:36.120
Yes, it was Berlin.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.120
I like Berlin, the band.

23:37.120 --> 23:38.120
On the metro.

23:38.120 --> 23:41.120
I like Wiener schnitzel, by the way.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.120
That's it for the questions.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.120
Oh, that's it?

23:43.120 --> 23:44.120
No more questions?

23:44.120 --> 23:45.120
I'm not going to read anymore.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.120
Dear Orange Lounge Radio, there needs to be an Oregon Trail for the DS, dammit.

23:49.120 --> 23:54.120
I'd prefer it be based on Oregon Trail 2 engine, but considering the chances of it coming out,

23:54.120 --> 23:55.120
I'd be happy anyways.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.120
What are other things y'all wish for?

23:57.120 --> 24:00.120
Perhaps even more ActRaiser for Sky, if he insists.

24:00.120 --> 24:04.120
Also, though not related to gaming, there should be a Deadpool movie.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.120
Yes!

24:05.120 --> 24:08.120
Unless they royally screw it up like X-Men 3, then I'd cry forever.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.120
That's Tim Tsurugi.

24:10.120 --> 24:14.120
Sorry, I had to look up on Wikipedia what the capital of Germany was,

24:14.120 --> 24:18.120
because I didn't want to look like a dumb shit anymore than I already do on the entire internet.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.120
It is Berlin, by the way.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.120
If they did a Deadpool movie, they'd have to get the guy that does his voice in the game,

24:22.120 --> 24:24.120
because he was the cryptkeeper.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.120
Sorry, what was our emailer emailing us about?

24:28.120 --> 24:29.120
I was too busy on Wikipedia.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.120
What else would I like to see on DS that was old-school gaming?

24:32.120 --> 24:35.120
Besides the mandatory Guardian legend answer,

24:35.120 --> 24:38.120
no, you know what, I don't want to see retro games on the DS.

24:38.120 --> 24:43.120
I want to see retro games on consoles I can play on my TV, just like the old retro games.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.120
Zero, there's nothing I want to see on DS that's retro.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.120
MDK.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.120
That's pretty old-school.

24:51.120 --> 24:54.120
I think that would be fun, because I like me some MDK.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.120
Did they ever make a sequel to MDK?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.120
Yes, they did, unfortunately.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.120
Insanest is yelling in chat room,

24:59.120 --> 25:02.120
Arcon, Arcon, Arcon, over and over again.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.120
That was a pretty awesome game, I'll give you that.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.120
Or StarCon.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.120
I say nothing.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.120
Nothing.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.120
Let's see.

25:12.120 --> 25:16.120
This one's too long, and I'm just going to end up posting it on the forums anyway.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.120
Okay.

25:19.120 --> 25:24.120
I also got an email from one of the people who emailed me in French.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.120
It says, thank you for replying to my email.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.120
I felt like such a star when you read my letter.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
I'm not used to all this.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.120
By the way, you guys are talking about Sony a whole lot.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.120
Thanks for making the effort, and I might have to go and pick up a Pokémon game or two.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.120
You guys seem to really love them.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
I have to be honest.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.120
We didn't really change anything in the creation of the show.

25:45.120 --> 25:49.120
It's just that, I guess, the weeks you were listening previous, there just was a lot of Xbox heavy news.

25:49.120 --> 25:55.120
But right now, there's not a lot of, you know, there seems to be actually more Sony and PC news this week.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.120
So, you know, it just depends on the flow of news.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
What we cover.

25:59.120 --> 26:02.120
By the way, that was Spamoflauge.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120
I love that name.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.120
That's a pretty rad name.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.120
And then I'm not going to read any more emails.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.120
Are the emailers being punished?

26:10.120 --> 26:11.120
Alright, I'll read one.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.120
One more. Alright.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.120
From AZHP.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.120
Okay.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.120
Hi guys, I was listening to your podcast on the way to class today,

26:16.120 --> 26:20.120
and I noticed you guys talking about how Mario Party 8 backups don't work on the Wii.

26:20.120 --> 26:25.120
As I am a college student and I back up my games so that I don't have to lug around DVD cases back and forth,

26:25.120 --> 26:29.120
mentioning this so I don't get you guys in trouble for talking piracy.

26:29.120 --> 26:33.120
In fact, I've also contributed to the design of a Wii mod chip for this purpose.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.120
Anyway, I can confirm that Mario Party 8 backups work fine.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.120
As I backed up mine, and I'm playing it as I type this.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.120
Wow, you're talented.

26:41.120 --> 26:48.120
What is likely the case of the misinformation on your last show is that the game does not work on PAL territory systems,

26:48.120 --> 26:51.120
which is a relatively common problem due to the incompatible video issues.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.120
Just wanted to clear that up, and while we're on the topic,

26:53.120 --> 26:57.120
Nintendo has been cracking down on piracy in other ways, if not through software.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.120
If you've gotten by a Wii now,

26:59.120 --> 27:04.120
there's a chance that you'll get a Wii that inside has three pins on its DVD controller chip cut off.

27:04.120 --> 27:10.120
These pins serve absolutely no purpose except to allow hackers like myself a backdoor into the system.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.120
They're always talking about a backdoor.

27:12.120 --> 27:18.120
I don't want to get into too much detail, but cutting the pins makes it extremely difficult to modify the console.

27:18.120 --> 27:21.120
However, it's not going to stop anything other than casual modding

27:21.120 --> 27:25.120
because you can find professional modders anywhere who will still take the job for 20 bucks.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.120
That brings me to my question for you guys.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.120
Is it possible for a company to stop piracy in its tracks?

27:29.120 --> 27:30.120
Fuck no.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.120
That was me, by the way.

27:32.120 --> 27:38.120
Do you think that the funds invested in stopping piracy is greater than the potential loss incurred from allowing it to run rampant?

27:38.120 --> 27:41.120
I'm not asking if the monetary value of the pirated goods is significant.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.120
Obviously, it is.

27:43.120 --> 27:50.120
However, most people who pirate wouldn't buy nearly the same amount of games as they are pirating.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.120
So do you think it's a company's best interest to stop modding,

27:52.120 --> 27:56.120
or do you think it's something that they do in order to appease uneducated shareholders?

27:56.120 --> 27:57.120
That's a good question.

27:57.120 --> 28:01.120
I think it is not in their interest, but I want to hear your two cents.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
Sorry for the long email.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.120
Hope you guys enjoyed it.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
AZHB.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
Okay.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.120
I think that that's part of it, too.

28:07.120 --> 28:18.120
The average boardroom suit and tie person is only going to look at numbers.

28:18.120 --> 28:25.120
They're only going to look at face value good idea because, remember, once you get into upper management, you turn into a moron.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.120
Wow, someone's jaded.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.120
That's all right.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.120
I understand.

28:30.120 --> 28:35.120
I think that some of it is for, you know, face.

28:35.120 --> 28:42.120
Some of it is, I think, they want to discourage the casual pirate.

28:42.120 --> 28:47.120
Like, these people said, oh, I can just clip this on the back of my PlayStation, and I can play whatever, blah, blah, blah.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.120
They want to discourage those people who don't know what the fuck they're doing.

28:50.120 --> 28:55.120
For those of us who know what we're doing, there's not going to be any way that they can stop us if we try hard enough.

28:55.120 --> 28:57.120
If we care enough.

28:57.120 --> 29:07.120
Here's my thing is that, with no disrespect to the emailer, you go to all this trouble to back up games because you don't want to haul DVD cases around.

29:07.120 --> 29:13.120
Am I really supposed to believe that?

29:13.120 --> 29:14.120
I mean, I guess.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.120
I guess it's possible.

29:15.120 --> 29:23.120
It seems to me like that's, it's not that I'm saying like, oh, you're a thief or whatever, I'm just like, that seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to.

29:23.120 --> 29:27.120
Just to not have to carry around DVD cases, which aren't that big a deal.

29:27.120 --> 29:39.120
Better yet, if you're backing up a game, say, onto another DVD to play it on your system, aren't you still carrying around that DVD?

29:39.120 --> 29:42.120
It's just now it's a backed up one instead of the real one?

29:42.120 --> 29:44.120
I don't understand how that's cutting down on DVDs.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.120
Of course, our chat room is chiming in here at chat.orangelaundry.com.

29:47.120 --> 29:55.120
Black Wolf, our old buddy who just turned 100 today, said, we tried to stop them, but they always get by what we do.

29:55.120 --> 30:01.120
It sounds better than, well, we won't do anything because they'll get around it anyway.

30:01.120 --> 30:04.120
I guess that's a good point, kind of going back to the boardroom things going on in there.

30:04.120 --> 30:14.120
NintendoManiac64 says, backing up DS and GBA games is very helpful, though, in regards to bulk and carrying things around and stuff like that.

30:14.120 --> 30:17.120
So, there you go, some chat room feedback.

30:17.120 --> 30:20.120
All right, any other emails?

30:20.120 --> 30:22.120
No, well, there were, but I didn't read them.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.120
All right, fair enough.

30:24.120 --> 30:32.120
If you would like your emails to be judged by DarkSakura, she's judged the rest of the mailbag this week, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.

30:32.120 --> 30:41.120
Back into some gaming news, let's talk about Halo 3, because I'm sure we're not going to be able to get from now until November and not bring up Halo 3 at least once.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.120
This is just a really big game.

30:44.120 --> 30:54.120
There are going to be some limited edition Halo 3 controllers and headsets coming out, and this is going to be coming out from GameStop.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.120
At least GameStop is now listing them.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.120
Everyone's going to have them.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.120
Everyone's going to have them, but GameStop has kind of spilled the beans on it.

30:59.120 --> 31:06.120
This is $59.99 for the wireless controllers, because you're going to pay $10 more because they have pretty pictures on them.

31:06.120 --> 31:13.120
One has the Spartan, one has the Covenant, and then there is also a green headset that's going to be coming out.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.120
I don't see the price for this one.

31:14.120 --> 31:17.120
Oh, it's also $59.99, the wireless headset.

31:17.120 --> 31:25.120
All it really is, it's green, and the button is orange, and it has a teeny little Halo 3 logo on it, which seems like a real waste of money.

31:25.120 --> 31:29.120
Those are all designed by Todd McFarlane, and they also come with figurines.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.120
Yeah, but do they really? This doesn't say anything about this.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.120
They do come with figurines.

31:34.120 --> 31:37.120
Oh, well that makes it a little more worth it. I don't see anything like that in here.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.120
Is that something unsaid?

31:38.120 --> 31:43.120
No, the controllers come with figurines. In fact, they've had a picture of the Halo 3.

31:43.120 --> 31:48.120
I don't know if Master Chief has come in with both of them, but one of them has Master Chief.

31:48.120 --> 31:54.120
Now, of course, even though these are limited edition, you know they're going to be everywhere when the game comes out, and they'll probably be trying to sell them when you buy the game.

31:54.120 --> 31:59.120
You want to get a matching controller or a matching headset with your game? You want the strategy guide?

31:59.120 --> 32:02.120
Because that's what they do. That's how they make their money.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.120
They'll be limited, so, you know.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.120
How limited, though? Come on.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.120
Pretty limited.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.120
You think?

32:08.120 --> 32:09.120
Eh, I think so.

32:09.120 --> 32:16.120
I got a Halo Xbox, and I'm not even that big a Halo fan. I just bought it because that's when I finally decided to buy an Xbox.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.120
And it probably came with a free game, didn't it?

32:18.120 --> 32:19.120
Halo, actually.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
Yeah.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.120
Hence the Halo Xbox.

32:22.120 --> 32:29.120
Anyways, I'm not a big fan of Halo, but I am a big fan of this game.

32:29.120 --> 32:35.120
Grand Theft Auto IV is going to be coming. They're getting a new trailer coming out on June 28th.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.120
Yes, once again teasing us with another game trailer.

32:38.120 --> 32:46.120
This trailer is called Looking for That Someone Special, and it's going to be released on June 28th.

32:46.120 --> 32:54.120
So if you're itching to get some more Grand Theft Auto footage, that's when you'll be able to find some.

32:54.120 --> 32:57.120
So, awesome! I cannot wait.

32:57.120 --> 33:01.120
You're really excited about this Grand Theft Auto, huh?

33:01.120 --> 33:02.120
Fuck yeah.

33:02.120 --> 33:06.120
I'll check it out, but I don't get excited about trailers.

33:06.120 --> 33:09.120
You're really that excited over a trailer?

33:09.120 --> 33:17.120
Yes, because it's just like the Transformers movie. I watch every bit of stuff I can on it.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.120
Of course now I'm going to start slowing down because I don't want to spoil anything.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.120
Although I've already spoiled too much.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.120
Fair enough, I suppose.

33:25.120 --> 33:35.120
Well, something that I guess people will care about is that track and field is going to be closer to release on Xbox Live Arcade,

33:35.120 --> 33:39.120
probably in, quote, the next month or two.

33:39.120 --> 33:44.120
Yeah, it's track and field.

33:44.120 --> 33:51.120
Not one of the best old school Konami games that exist, but they've had some pretty good ones lately.

33:51.120 --> 33:56.120
Like, I like Time Pilot, Rush and Attack was kind of fun, but track and field was just like, you just would slam the-

33:56.120 --> 33:57.120
It's making my thumbs hurt, the game.

33:57.120 --> 34:02.120
Yeah, it's like all those old school Mario Party games where you just hit the button over and over and over again.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.120
That's all track and field was.

34:03.120 --> 34:06.120
One auto-fire controller will fix that.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.120
Hell yeah.

34:07.120 --> 34:12.120
That's why we had the turbo button on the turbo graphics. Hi.

34:12.120 --> 34:17.120
I needed to find one of those easy achievement points. Hell yeah.

34:17.120 --> 34:21.120
Well, maybe there'll be something to kind of get around the auto-fire or something.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.120
You'd think they'd put something into place, but we'll see I guess.

34:24.120 --> 34:28.120
Oh, they won't? Come on, these people are lazy when it comes to making these games.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.120
They're just pouring it straight over.

34:29.120 --> 34:34.120
Maybe that'll be a title that comes out. Like, you know how some weeks they've been doing two games a week lately?

34:34.120 --> 34:38.120
Maybe that'll be kind of the B-side for the week, will be track and field.

34:38.120 --> 34:45.120
Anyhow, Halo 2 and Shadowrun, of course, both recently came out in the new games for Windows collection.

34:45.120 --> 34:49.120
That's Vista only, or is it?

34:49.120 --> 34:56.120
Falling Leaf Studios has actually gone to extents to make the games XP compatible.

34:56.120 --> 35:01.120
What the company is saying is that if you buy the games from Amazon through their links,

35:01.120 --> 35:05.120
because you know how Amazon has that referral program where you can get money back or whatever?

35:05.120 --> 35:13.120
Then what they will do, they will send you for free the initial release of this compatibility software that will let you run them on XP.

35:13.120 --> 35:18.120
Here's a quote from the CEO Brian Thomason that says,

35:18.120 --> 35:30.120
First, Microsoft claimed that it was impossible to implement DirectX 10 compatibility atop Windows XP, and now they also want us to believe that they couldn't successfully launch two DirectX 9-based titles on XP either.

35:30.120 --> 35:34.120
We plan to expose both theories as patently false.

35:34.120 --> 35:40.120
But now they haven't really, you know, they haven't showed this to be true yet.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.120
This software doesn't already exist.

35:42.120 --> 35:46.120
Supposedly this is going to come out within a few months.

35:46.120 --> 35:49.120
So we shall see if they can expose that to work.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.120
I would laugh if it was a huge scam.

35:51.120 --> 35:55.120
But is it a scam? I mean, you're still getting the game for the regular price.

35:55.120 --> 35:59.120
It's just that, you know, they got a cut of it from Amazon, so I don't know.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.120
We'll see. Anyways.

36:01.120 --> 36:04.120
Bandit in chat is very adamant here. He says,

36:04.120 --> 36:09.120
It's a fake. He's 19 and is lying. He makes 10% on that shiznit.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.120
That's true. There's really nothing they can do about it.

36:11.120 --> 36:14.120
Somebody complained to Amazon, maybe. I don't know.

36:14.120 --> 36:21.120
Well, I guess our usual plug for GameTap.

36:21.120 --> 36:23.120
But anyways, this is news.

36:23.120 --> 36:28.120
Brand new. They're a free service that they launched, I believe, last month.

36:28.120 --> 36:33.120
They're actually now going to be expanding it, which was currently 30 games, to 40 games now.

36:33.120 --> 36:37.120
So I guess they've got a few more people backing it.

36:37.120 --> 36:42.120
And they've also, I guess, for the regular subscription service, they've added Psychonauts,

36:42.120 --> 36:47.120
King of Fighters 97, Golden Axe the Duel, Art of Fighting 3, and Metal Slug 3.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.120
Dude, Golden Axe the Duel.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.120
I think that's pretty awesome that Psychonauts is on it.

36:51.120 --> 36:54.120
Those are some pretty awesome games they put on there for free.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.120
Dude, I love Golden Axe.

36:56.120 --> 37:01.120
I don't like the first Genesis one. It makes me miss the arcade.

37:01.120 --> 37:05.120
Golden Axe the Duel was actually one of the first Saturn games I ever played.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.120
I keep forgetting games have a Saturn.

37:07.120 --> 37:11.120
When I lived in Alabama, my friend wanted a Saturn so badly he imported it.

37:11.120 --> 37:13.120
It was like the world's biggest Sega fanboy.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.120
So he imported a Saturn.

37:14.120 --> 37:18.120
So the first games I got to play was King of Fighters 95.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.120
I learned the RAM cart switch.

37:20.120 --> 37:25.120
And Golden Axe the Duel and some Gundam game that was okay.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.120
Act deft, and our chat room is getting very excited.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.120
King of Fighters 97 for free.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.120
No, it's for paid accounts.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.120
Oh, only the paid accounts for King of Fighters 97?

37:33.120 --> 37:34.120
Those are your games for the paid accounts.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.120
Although it may cycle through into the free games.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.120
You never know.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.120
There's 40 games to choose from right now for free.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.120
Interesting.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.120
That would suck though if you were getting really attached to a title and then they pulled

37:45.120 --> 37:46.120
the plug on it.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.120
But I guess that's how they make their money.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.120
Dude, it's-

37:48.120 --> 37:50.120
I mean, they're not in business to just give things away.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.120
Exactly.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.120
I guess that's true.

37:53.120 --> 38:00.120
Well, one thing that I think our Second Life friends will enjoy, another thing to keep

38:00.120 --> 38:06.120
you ingrained in unreality is that they are adding voice.

38:06.120 --> 38:16.120
It's actually, from what I understand, it's at Warhead, one of the places in Second Life.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.120
I don't play Second Life, so I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.120
Me neither.

38:20.120 --> 38:28.120
You are greeted by dancing and flying sperm and gunfire.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.120
That sounds like Second Life.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.120
This is even better than the flying cocks.

38:31.120 --> 38:35.120
That is something that they should turn into a TV show.

38:35.120 --> 38:41.120
But apparently now that's not happening anymore because they have voice chat.

38:41.120 --> 38:47.120
So people, you can download a special version of the client and in certain places, and one

38:47.120 --> 38:51.120
of the places is Waterhead, you can hang out and just chat with people.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.120
Dude, you know what I can do?

38:52.120 --> 38:56.120
I can pick up my phone and call people and chat with them if I wanted to fucking talk

38:56.120 --> 38:57.120
to people.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.120
I'm online for a reason.

38:59.120 --> 39:05.120
Drewnami in chat says, it's about fucking time Second Life there has had voice for fucking

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
ever.

39:06.120 --> 39:12.120
Well, there is like a competing type of thing that has had voice chat for a while.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.120
I've heard of there before.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.120
You remember DDR Angel when she's come on this program?

39:15.120 --> 39:16.120
She was really into there.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.120
It was that game she was really into.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.120
So, huh.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.120
Well, there you go.

39:20.120 --> 39:25.120
I did find the Final Fantasy VII thing that they made in Second Life.

39:25.120 --> 39:27.120
It was pretty cool.

39:27.120 --> 39:34.120
I've always wanted to check out Second Life, but I always go back to World of Warcraft

39:34.120 --> 39:36.120
because I have no First Life.

39:36.120 --> 39:39.120
And I was like, oh my god, this sucks, and then deleted it.

39:39.120 --> 39:44.120
I'm afraid that with Second Life, it would be like me and the Sims where no good can

39:44.120 --> 39:46.120
come of this.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.120
Can't you start a little OLR club or something?

39:48.120 --> 39:49.120
I don't want to do that.

39:49.120 --> 39:53.120
I guess there used to be a little all games room, but then somebody stopped paying rent

39:53.120 --> 39:55.120
on it or whatever, so it got imploded.

39:55.120 --> 39:59.120
Because I remember somebody sent us a picture of our little OLR logo somewhere in Second

39:59.120 --> 40:03.120
Life, and I was like, oh, that's kind of neat.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.120
There you have it.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.120
So much for Second Life.

40:07.120 --> 40:13.120
While I was bored during my first life, I was surfing on Dig, and this story was dug,

40:13.120 --> 40:14.120
which I thought was interesting.

40:14.120 --> 40:19.120
It's from the website toold2play.com, and the topic is about, it says, childhood gaming,

40:19.120 --> 40:22.120
what games would you like remade?

40:22.120 --> 40:25.120
And it just basically goes on to say, hey, we remember these games from when we were

40:25.120 --> 40:29.120
older, from the Nintendo Entertainment System to Genesis and 3DO.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.120
Apparently, this author remembers the 3DO.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.120
I do not remember the 3DO.

40:34.120 --> 40:39.120
However, this guy made a list of the top 15 games that he would like to see.

40:39.120 --> 40:43.120
It's by Code Monkey is the guy's name who wrote this.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.120
It's 15 games.

40:44.120 --> 40:49.120
It goes all the way from Red Baron on the PC, Shadow Gate was number two, WWF Wrestling

40:49.120 --> 40:54.120
the arcade game number three, River City Ransom number four, and number five was Maniac Mansion

40:54.120 --> 41:00.120
all the way down through Ikari Warriors, number 15 on the NES, just talking about how he would

41:00.120 --> 41:02.120
like to see these kind of redesigned.

41:02.120 --> 41:05.120
Well, Maniac Mansion has a sequel.

41:05.120 --> 41:10.120
I thought it did, but these games, all these series kind of died a long time ago.

41:10.120 --> 41:12.120
I guess.

41:12.120 --> 41:16.120
And he says he remembers Zelda, but he can't really say Zelda because Zelda's not really

41:16.120 --> 41:17.120
dead.

41:17.120 --> 41:21.120
I'm just kidding, but these series are all kind of dead.

41:21.120 --> 41:24.120
Ross Steel UT in chat says Crystalis.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
That's a good pick.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.120
That was a good game.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.120
I also like from this list 11 RC program.

41:28.120 --> 41:32.120
You know I can't get through this segment without saying Guardian Legend.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.120
It's a must.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
What other old school game?

41:35.120 --> 41:36.120
How about Star Tropics?

41:36.120 --> 41:38.120
What the hell ever happened to Star Tropics?

41:38.120 --> 41:40.120
I'm surprised I haven't made it to Virtual Console yet.

41:40.120 --> 41:46.120
I'm surprised too, and I'm surprised that the, what was the kid's name in Star Tropics?

41:46.120 --> 41:49.120
There is a perfect character for Smash Brothers at some point.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.120
If I can remember, God, why can't I remember the kid's name?

41:51.120 --> 41:55.120
The only bad thing though about that is going to be the fact that you have to dip that manual

41:55.120 --> 41:56.120
in water.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.120
Was it Mikey?

41:57.120 --> 41:59.120
I think it was Mikey or Mike or something.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.120
Mikey I think was Goonies too.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.120
He had a really generic name.

42:01.120 --> 42:06.120
Mikey was Goonies too, and it was Zeb or Zeke or something that was a bad guy.

42:06.120 --> 42:09.120
There you go.

42:09.120 --> 42:13.120
Anyways, so we talked a little bit about MAME earlier.

42:13.120 --> 42:22.120
Now, one of the boards for, actually the Capcom CPS3 arcade board has slightly been cracked.

42:22.120 --> 42:26.120
They've gotten some of the code to run from the boards, and sooner or later they're going

42:26.120 --> 42:31.120
to have the whole board emulated, and of course, that means that some games that you might

42:31.120 --> 42:38.120
like will be able to be played, such as Jojo's Venture, Street Fighter III, and Red Earth.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.120
I thought you said games I like would be playable.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.120
Well, Street Fighter III is not bad.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.120
It isn't.

42:43.120 --> 42:46.120
It wasn't that bad.

42:46.120 --> 42:51.120
It was no Street Fighter II or, I never really got into Street Fighter III.

42:51.120 --> 42:54.120
Maybe I'm not giving you enough credit, but I didn't care for it.

42:54.120 --> 42:57.120
I had my one moment of glory in Street Fighter III.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.120
Yeah, I had a moment.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.120
Maybe not a moment of glory.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.120
No, I played it a lot, but I had my moment of glory.

43:01.120 --> 43:06.120
Street Fighter III and I went out on a date, but we just didn't get along, and it wouldn't

43:06.120 --> 43:09.120
put out, so I had to say goodbye.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.120
There you have it.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.120
But I guess that's cool.

43:12.120 --> 43:17.120
For all you folks that like to pirate tons and tons of arcade games and play them on

43:17.120 --> 43:21.120
MAME, that's great news for you guys, so congratulations.

43:21.120 --> 43:30.120
Well, here's an interesting thing that's being advertised for GameStop.com, is a Wii Blaster

43:30.120 --> 43:39.120
available June 27th, like pew, pew, pew lasers, I guess, but it's on one of their flyers that

43:39.120 --> 43:43.120
it will be available, like I said, on the 27th.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.120
I guess to go out with...

43:45.120 --> 43:50.120
What game's coming out on Wii that's going to require a gun, maybe?

43:50.120 --> 43:52.120
Well, there's Chicken Shoot.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.120
Oh, yay!

43:53.120 --> 43:54.120
Chicken Shoot!

43:54.120 --> 44:00.120
Hey, I guess you may be able to use it for maybe Resident Evil 4.

44:00.120 --> 44:08.120
Well, later on, back when we get into the fall, Chronicles and Ghost Squad, I don't know.

44:08.120 --> 44:09.120
But why do we need this yet?

44:09.120 --> 44:11.120
Maybe Duck Hunt on Virtual Console.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.120
Duck Hunt!

44:12.120 --> 44:16.120
Or better yet, this is just a piece of useless crap that they're trying to push on you.

44:16.120 --> 44:21.120
Or how about this, better yet, why don't Nintendo do what Nintendo does best and hold out on

44:21.120 --> 44:28.120
the good stuff, so instead of giving us Duck Hunt, why don't you give us Wild Gunman, which

44:28.120 --> 44:30.120
if you've ever played Wild Gunman...

44:30.120 --> 44:32.120
Maybe we'll get Blastress.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.120
There was seriously nothing to Wild Gunman.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.120
It was who can pull the trigger faster when the thing says go.

44:37.120 --> 44:43.120
They made an entire video game and sold this for a lot of money, an entire game out of

44:43.120 --> 44:47.120
who can push the button first was the game.

44:47.120 --> 44:52.120
So you'll probably see that on Virtual Console, and then you'll get such brilliant classics

44:52.120 --> 44:53.120
like Hogan's Alley.

44:53.120 --> 44:58.120
But then, and only then, will Nintendo finally deliver the Duck Hunt.

44:58.120 --> 45:04.120
Well, what this basically does is just allows you to attach your remote and nunchuck to

45:04.120 --> 45:06.120
one device to turn into a shotgun thing.

45:06.120 --> 45:10.120
Although the Wii Blaster is not going to be the only device to come out, actually at the

45:10.120 --> 45:16.120
same time, Joytech is going to be releasing the Wii Sharpshooter, not quite as orange

45:16.120 --> 45:19.120
as the other one, but accomplishes the same thing.

45:19.120 --> 45:25.120
Basically puts your Wii nunchuck kind of in the pistol grip area and then the remote on

45:25.120 --> 45:26.120
top.

45:26.120 --> 45:29.120
To be honest, both of these are completely useless.

45:29.120 --> 45:34.120
It's not the Wii kind of shotgun thing that you saw at E3.

45:34.120 --> 45:36.120
This is something completely different.

45:36.120 --> 45:39.120
It does not enhance your gameplay at all.

45:39.120 --> 45:43.120
Frisbee in Chad reminds us about something related to Wild Gunman.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.120
Frisbee says, a Wild Gunman was good on WarioWare Game Boy Advance.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.120
I totally forgot that it was in that game.

45:48.120 --> 45:51.120
But yeah, there was many references to Wild Gunman in there.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.120
Interesting.

45:52.120 --> 45:55.120
I don't know, is this a peripheral you're interested in getting, Jamie?

45:55.120 --> 45:57.120
I know you like to collect everything related to games.

45:57.120 --> 45:59.120
That's how I thought.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.120
Me too.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.120
Me too.

46:01.120 --> 46:02.120
Maybe if we get a point blank.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.120
Seriously though, there was one- Point blank Wii might sell me on it.

46:05.120 --> 46:09.120
I don't remember what it was called, but there is one peripheral out there that looks

46:09.120 --> 46:11.120
like it might actually be some good.

46:11.120 --> 46:15.120
It was a thing that looked kind of like a pistol and you actually put your remote into

46:15.120 --> 46:18.120
the pistol and the trigger on the pistol would hit the B button.

46:18.120 --> 46:23.120
So that does change it a little bit and then that way the nunchuck's just kind of independent

46:23.120 --> 46:25.120
from that and you just hold that in your other hand.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.120
So that's more of something that you would probably be looking for.

46:27.120 --> 46:32.120
This thing is just attaching the remote and nunchuck together, which will probably allow

46:32.120 --> 46:35.120
you not to play certain games if you were to actually do that.

46:35.120 --> 46:36.120
So it's a waste of money.

46:36.120 --> 46:39.120
It's just like those fucking sports attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.

46:39.120 --> 46:43.120
Have you ever seen the attachments, and I see the surprise all the time, that look like

46:43.120 --> 46:45.120
a tennis racket and a baseball bat?

46:45.120 --> 46:46.120
Exactly what I was talking about.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.120
Boy, does that stuff look crappy.

46:48.120 --> 46:53.120
Seriously, somebody is selling shaped plastic for lots of money.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.120
Yeah, because people are dumb and will buy it.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.120
Yeah, exactly.

46:57.120 --> 47:01.120
I was like, dude, remember the consumer market?

47:01.120 --> 47:02.120
Stupid.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.120
Make stuff stupid people will want.

47:04.120 --> 47:09.120
Maybe having one of these plastic things shaped like a tennis racket will help you win the

47:09.120 --> 47:13.120
first organized Wii tennis tournament that any of us know of.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.120
It's called Wimbledon.

47:15.120 --> 47:16.120
Get it?

47:16.120 --> 47:17.120
Instead of Wimbledon.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.120
Wimbledon.

47:19.120 --> 47:23.120
It's being held June 23rd at Barcade, which is in Brooklyn.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.120
I was just there.

47:24.120 --> 47:25.120
It's pretty awesome.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.120
Barcade is pretty cool.

47:26.120 --> 47:29.120
I should have gone to Barcade.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.120
I knew of that place.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.120
I knew it was in Brooklyn.

47:32.120 --> 47:34.120
I was fucking in Brooklyn just a week ago.

47:34.120 --> 47:36.120
I didn't even think to go to this place.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.120
Oh well.

47:37.120 --> 47:40.120
Here's a quote from the official site for Wimbledon.

47:40.120 --> 47:44.120
Wimbledon is a Wii tennis tournament being held on June 23rd, that's next Saturday,

47:44.120 --> 47:49.120
from noon until 5 p.m. at Barcade in Brooklyn, specifically Williamsburg.

47:49.120 --> 47:54.120
There will be singles and doubles tournaments, prizes and beer, maybe even some strawberries

47:54.120 --> 47:55.120
and cream.

47:55.120 --> 47:57.120
Oh, and cucumber sandwiches.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.120
Okay.

47:58.120 --> 48:01.120
I guess that's a joke about Wimbledon that I don't get.

48:01.120 --> 48:02.120
I don't know.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.120
Okay.

48:03.120 --> 48:07.120
I don't watch tennis on TV or anything, but I like Wii tennis.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.120
It's kind of fun.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.120
Yeah.

48:09.120 --> 48:11.120
I know it's not real tennis, but there you go.

48:11.120 --> 48:15.120
I was just thinking those plastic attachments for the Wii and stuff.

48:15.120 --> 48:18.120
You know people have trouble as it is holding onto the Wiimote.

48:18.120 --> 48:22.120
Can you imagine that with the chunk of plastic flying towards your TV?

48:22.120 --> 48:26.120
Talk about some serious damage right there.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.120
Wow.

48:28.120 --> 48:30.120
Anywho.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.120
So yeah, you want to get scared?

48:32.120 --> 48:34.120
Well, here's your chance.

48:34.120 --> 48:38.120
WifeSwap is looking for gamers to be on their show.

48:38.120 --> 48:40.120
Wait, like the TV show?

48:40.120 --> 48:41.120
Yes, like the TV show.

48:41.120 --> 48:44.120
Wasn't that the one that had my favorite lady ever?

48:44.120 --> 48:46.120
Yes, the God Warrior.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.120
I fucking love her.

48:47.120 --> 48:49.120
She's the best thing ever.

48:49.120 --> 48:56.120
So yeah, so apparently you can possibly, if you're picked, you and another family will

48:56.120 --> 49:02.120
swap wives and have the chance to earn $20,000.

49:02.120 --> 49:06.120
I'm guessing you're going to get someone that hates video games coming to your family

49:06.120 --> 49:07.120
if you're a gamer.

49:07.120 --> 49:10.120
Oh my God, Nellie would be perfect for this program.

49:10.120 --> 49:12.120
Yeah, but we don't have a kid.

49:12.120 --> 49:17.120
They said two parents and at least one child, six or older.

49:17.120 --> 49:21.120
So unless we can adopt someone really quick, I don't think that's going to happen.

49:21.120 --> 49:24.120
Can you imagine if Jamie went on this program?

49:24.120 --> 49:26.120
I want no money.

49:26.120 --> 49:27.120
I want nothing.

49:27.120 --> 49:29.120
I want my God and I want my family.

49:29.120 --> 49:32.120
She's tampering and doubts that it's stuff.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.120
She's not a Christian.

49:34.120 --> 49:37.120
Yes, you could have that in your house, Jamie.

49:37.120 --> 49:39.120
Wouldn't that be exciting?

49:39.120 --> 49:43.120
I'll kill whoever.

49:43.120 --> 49:50.120
I'll kill them to death with a spork.

49:50.120 --> 49:55.120
Rama in chat says, you know, if Dark Sakura had a kid, this would be perfect.

49:55.120 --> 49:59.120
I think Loki would be a good candidate for this show too.

49:59.120 --> 50:01.120
I don't plan on breeding.

50:01.120 --> 50:04.120
Anyways, I thought you were going to have a kid named Error.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
No.

50:05.120 --> 50:12.120
If you are interested and you qualify, you know, have a child that's six years or older,

50:12.120 --> 50:19.120
if you're interested, you want to email jodyfriedman at rdfusa.com.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.120
You know, just send her a letter to say hello.

50:21.120 --> 50:25.120
Why don't you send her an email and say, hi, what's up, babe?

50:25.120 --> 50:31.120
Or just go to abc.go.com slash primetime slash wife swap.

50:31.120 --> 50:35.120
I hope one of our listeners gets to do this, that would be far too exciting.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.120
You should borrow a kid.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.120
I wish I could.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.120
Rama says that was actually trading spouses.

50:41.120 --> 50:45.120
The Fox version of the show was the God Warrior lady.

50:45.120 --> 50:47.120
The clip that I played was trading spouses.

50:47.120 --> 50:51.120
Wife Swap is the ABC version of the same fucking show.

50:51.120 --> 50:52.120
Yeah.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.120
Okay.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.120
Kind of like Super Nanny and Nanny 911.

50:55.120 --> 50:57.120
Same fucking show, two different networks.

50:57.120 --> 51:00.120
You should rent a child.

51:00.120 --> 51:04.120
Yeah, you could borrow a child for like two weeks.

51:04.120 --> 51:07.120
I might see if a coworker has one you can borrow.

51:07.120 --> 51:08.120
No.

51:08.120 --> 51:12.120
Besides, I'd get some crazy bitch in my house throwing my shit away.

51:12.120 --> 51:16.120
I don't need anyone to be doing that shit.

51:16.120 --> 51:20.120
Or actually, no, that's right, I would be there.

51:20.120 --> 51:23.120
So I would be able to monitor where she throws shit away.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.120
No more playing games.

51:24.120 --> 51:29.120
Fine, I can do that, you stupid whore.

51:29.120 --> 51:32.120
And you know they're going to get some World of Warcraft addict on the show.

51:32.120 --> 51:35.120
And you get some smart ass kid that obviously it's not your kid or whatever.

51:35.120 --> 51:37.120
Yeah, that's my eight-year-old child.

51:37.120 --> 51:42.120
They're going to get some fucking World of Warcraft addict who's going to start twitching

51:42.120 --> 51:44.120
the minute they're missing a Tuesday night raid.

51:44.120 --> 51:47.120
They're going to start going into, like, and they're going to put him in like an Amish

51:47.120 --> 51:50.120
house and he's going to go, oh, actually no, wait, it's Wife Swap, huh?

51:50.120 --> 51:53.120
They're not going to put him, yeah, he's just going to stay there.

51:53.120 --> 51:55.120
They should get a wife that's more addicted than him.

51:55.120 --> 51:59.440
Yeah, they should get it well or whatever never mind. I guess it's not husband swap

51:59.840 --> 52:02.200
I'm just gonna shut up and let the callers do the

52:02.720 --> 52:05.800
Doing now if you want to be funny if you want to yeah

52:05.800 --> 52:10.640
Please be more funny than I am if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAMEOLR

52:10.640 --> 52:14.040
Let you sleep with the new wife unless she's ugly in which case you wouldn't want to touch that shit

52:14.040 --> 52:15.400
You're horrible

52:15.400 --> 52:21.280
1-877-GAMEOLR let's go to the phones or orange launch radio on Skype. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

52:21.280 --> 52:27.040
Luke it's a Nintendo maniac 64. Hello Nintendo. Hi 64. What's on your mind?

52:29.600 --> 52:33.720
Oh right now I just gotta ask one little random question

52:33.880 --> 52:41.040
Do you know of anyone who actually doesn't use Windows XP or Vista other than like Mac and Linux and stuff?

52:42.280 --> 52:49.920
Like who uses something older if you will use any I mean like someone like me who's like a diehard Windows 2k addict

52:49.920 --> 52:53.600
I like fanboy. Yes. I know people who use a

52:55.400 --> 52:56.760
Palm OS

52:56.760 --> 52:59.360
I know people who still are on Windows 98

52:59.640 --> 53:05.960
Because they just don't feel like upgrading because all they use is the internet like my people who are still on Windows 3.11

53:06.360 --> 53:12.640
My my dad uses Windows ME, and I have no idea why but he does I know I'm compare downstairs

53:12.640 --> 53:18.520
It still works with 3.11. That's PC. I'm on right now is 98. How do you out of curiosity? Why do you ask?

53:18.520 --> 53:24.240
Yeah, I was just wondering since I don't know I never like people say like on the internet

53:24.240 --> 53:29.280
how like Vista was fucking like stick with XP. I always commented and saying like

53:30.240 --> 53:38.240
2k woohoo, let's bloat. I had to have my computer replaced because my husband decided he was gonna be nice and upgrade my

53:38.280 --> 53:40.280
computer from

53:40.680 --> 53:42.680
Windows 2000 to

53:42.680 --> 53:46.920
Um XP and my computer upgrading I

53:47.720 --> 53:53.320
Like I said he thought that he was upgrading and it turned out that it completely fucked over my system

53:53.320 --> 53:58.080
I ended up having to have it anyway because I bought a vio now my vio is starting to die

53:58.080 --> 54:02.040
And I'm just so sad about the day that I would have to get a new computer with Vista on it

54:02.720 --> 54:08.560
Well, I have to ask another question. Okay. Well, it was in the first part of maybe was like wait second

54:08.560 --> 54:14.640
I mean when you guys like start talking like it was something like there was a bunch of anime coming to something and then look you

54:14.640 --> 54:19.400
Started going raving about how awesome Akira was. Okay. Well, what's the anime for?

54:19.400 --> 54:23.360
Like is it coming to something Xbox Live Arcade their movies?

54:23.360 --> 54:29.800
Oh Xbox Live Mark video marketplace like well same fucking thing. We the Xbox Live. I don't 360

54:29.800 --> 54:35.480
Yeah, it's actually already there right now. So okay and third off. Okay. I gotta have a mini rant

54:35.480 --> 54:40.280
All right, make it quick distance ball, man. I played it at friend's house

54:40.840 --> 54:43.940
They had cut the custom controls. It's like

54:44.640 --> 54:49.480
Half you can't map the weapon cycle to X or O

54:49.880 --> 54:54.040
what the crap and you can't map it so that you can have turning and

54:54.520 --> 54:58.320
Moving forward and back on the same analog stick since I grew up in Goldeneye and stuff

54:58.320 --> 55:02.440
That was the folk control scene and it's drilled in my head. I gotta do that and

55:02.440 --> 55:05.960
It won't even let me change the individual axes

55:05.960 --> 55:12.460
But what the heck boo in general the games that don't let you change the button configuration or whatever you like no matter what it

55:12.460 --> 55:16.080
Is well, the thing is it did let me change the buttons themselves

55:16.600 --> 55:21.380
Except that it wouldn't let me put weapon cycle on to X or O

55:21.720 --> 55:27.240
That's strange ones all over the place. I haven't played resistance. You guys have played it more than I have

55:27.240 --> 55:31.840
Is there's only one button for weapon cycle and it's I think because?

55:32.800 --> 55:36.520
Well, all the buttons are analog I guess but for whatever reason

55:36.520 --> 55:41.080
I don't know the it's the r2 button is the one you do for weapon cycle you tap it

55:41.080 --> 55:44.720
Then I'll switch to the next one or you hold it down and it'll allow you to switch which one you want

55:44.720 --> 55:50.060
I don't know. I love the it seemed pretty straightforward to me. I just kept it on the default stuff

55:50.060 --> 55:55.220
So I like them actually Oh kind of like we're it'd be like on the a button like the GameCube in 64

55:55.220 --> 56:01.900
Like going after example, where's the next one? Just keep hitting a it's like eventually find whatever weapon you're looking for

56:01.900 --> 56:06.760
I suppose it's similar to like when I go when it well a couple years ago when I would go back and forth between

56:06.940 --> 56:09.060
fantasy star and Final Fantasy 11

56:09.100 --> 56:11.540
They had the camera on completely different

56:11.860 --> 56:14.820
Axises so that like when I went up and down and stuff

56:14.820 --> 56:18.720
He would like totally mess with my head because it was all messed up there

56:19.660 --> 56:21.820
All right. Well Nintendo mini x64

56:21.820 --> 56:26.560
Thanks so much for the call and hope you can get used to the controls in the game the way they are

56:26.700 --> 56:32.060
Yeah, well, I don't the ps3 so that's perfectly fine. Well more incentive for me not to get one

56:32.060 --> 56:34.060
You got it. So never mind then have fun

56:34.380 --> 56:36.380
Three Sony back by

56:36.780 --> 56:39.700
All right, if you would like to give us a call, it's a

56:40.820 --> 56:48.540
Orange lounge radio on skype or one eight seven seven game. Oh LR more phone calls. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

56:48.540 --> 56:54.700
Ravens dolphin. Well, hello Ravens dolphin. What's on your mind my friend? Why do you sound analog?

56:54.700 --> 56:58.820
I hate Skype 2.5. You sound like you're on like an old-fashioned phone

56:58.820 --> 57:03.500
I'm sorry you you kind of sound a little weird too, but whatever. We'll just have to deal what's on your mind

57:03.660 --> 57:09.100
It's the 2.5 thing. I'm sorry. It's all right. At least you're not breaking up or whatever. What's on your mind?

57:09.580 --> 57:16.660
Yeah, it's much clearer, but that sucks. Oh, sorry for going on that little rant Mortal Kombat for we I was so tempted to buy

57:16.660 --> 57:18.660
This the other day, but I didn't what about it. I

57:19.460 --> 57:23.580
Played it and I got to tell you something. It's a good Mortal Kombat game

57:23.580 --> 57:28.200
I was actually surprised that they did the wiimote thing very well

57:28.500 --> 57:35.500
Is it easy to control because that's the thing that holds me back. Oh, yeah. Oh hell yeah, really super easy

57:36.220 --> 57:38.300
It is a little one here. How easy yeah

57:39.380 --> 57:43.860
B you press on the B button and you like move it like a half moon up and down

57:43.860 --> 57:49.740
left and right and you do like the scorpion get over here real easy you get to do and

57:50.340 --> 57:56.940
Fatalities are just super easy. You know what I do with set fatalities. You just hold the button and swing it all around see what happens

57:57.860 --> 57:59.460
Something like that you swing it

57:59.460 --> 58:03.380
I could kind of like you're you have you have your you swing it and then you press the little

58:03.780 --> 58:06.780
Directional pad and it will do a fatality. That's how easy it is

58:08.540 --> 58:12.460
That sounds pretty funny, how do you move the guy around the screen you just use the control pad on the wiimote

58:12.460 --> 58:16.580
Yeah, you just use the little nunchuck and it just moves around

58:17.380 --> 58:20.900
Durr you have the nunchuck. I may say I guess I will check it out at some point

58:20.900 --> 58:26.280
I'm just a little bummed. It doesn't have online play because Nintendo is holding out for whatever reason so

58:26.900 --> 58:28.860
jerks

58:28.860 --> 58:30.980
Can I just rant about the new Skype on?

58:31.780 --> 58:33.460
the new Skype

58:33.460 --> 58:40.320
Yeah, 2.5. It has this really annoying ring thing and it gets in your ear. It's like this is Rob ring this sucks

58:40.320 --> 58:47.520
Yeah, that's just my voice that you're hearing that has nothing to do with Skype back to games back to games one more thing

58:48.280 --> 58:52.960
Yes, one more thing. You got a black DS. I sure did a black DS light

58:52.960 --> 58:57.520
I was so close to getting the pink one, but then I decided that next time I go to New York

58:57.520 --> 59:03.040
Hopefully the engraving machine will be working and I can get an engraved and engraving show up much better on the black DS than

59:03.040 --> 59:04.320
It does on any of the other colors

59:04.320 --> 59:06.320
So I in the end I went for the black DS

59:06.320 --> 59:12.540
What I do want to get though is I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get the little pink case with the sparkling little bling on it

59:12.540 --> 59:14.540
that's what I'm gonna get to have my

59:14.760 --> 59:16.760
princess peach homage

59:17.160 --> 59:20.520
I'm so happy for you. I got a black one too, and I love it

59:21.480 --> 59:24.400
Yes, and I actually hear the black ones are usually bigger

59:25.960 --> 59:29.240
So I hear yeah, all right, but that's just a rumor all right

59:29.800 --> 59:35.560
Anything else you anything else you want to add Raven Sullivan don't download 2.5. It sucks all right

59:35.560 --> 59:39.060
I won't I'll hold out on the current Skype. I have see you later, Raven Sullivan. Bye

59:39.760 --> 59:45.960
If you'd like to give us a call the username is the orange launch radio on Skype or one eight seven seven game. Ol are

59:48.020 --> 59:50.020
Hello you're on orange launch radio, who's this

59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.520
It sounds like do you like put this on auto dial or something and then when we finally pick up you like jump for

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.520
The microphone like oh shit

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:08.840
Don't you I just I just use brute force. I just say you know hammer the line guilty of that. Yeah, that's all right

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.600
What's on your mind? It was good to see you this weekend Zaku by the way. Thanks for coming out

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.220
Yeah, you missed our trip. You missed our trip to Astor place in the video game store

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.880
That's what we did after I know I had to play distorted. You know oh, yeah, just came out then I

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.000
Had him out there. It's all good buddy. What's on your mind?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Let me see you already know that

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.760
Rock star is basically you know shifting more on to the Microsoft side now that they confirmed exclusive stuff for granted title for

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.760
Basically dispelling all this you know any chances of it showing up on the ps3 at all

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:47.400
Yeah, I've heard right and they and they had the Gulf to say that the ps3 version would move consoles

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:54.800
Which is just a load of it's a load of bullshit because if there's nothing beyond the regular game that the ps3 folks could

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:59.120
Okay, you know can can attain then what's the point of actually playing it?

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.280
Well actually was it this is granted thought of for

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:08.240
Yeah, rock star confirmed it in there in the shareholders meeting it will move consoles because well

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.440
Oh wait, they don't have the episodic content either. Yes there we go

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.760
That's exactly and Microsoft paid a good 50 million dollars to keep it on their side

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.060
I think I'll just move consoles both for 360 and ps3

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:24.320
How could you how could you move consoles when one side doesn't have anything beyond the gameplay?

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.000
That's what that's what that's what I'm trying to get across to you

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.600
We have the 360 which has the ability to go beyond the regular game

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.040
You know in terms of multiplayer and exclusive content and the ps3 can't even do that yet

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.160
So you will you weigh both of them and you see the 360 has more value

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:50.740
Than the than the ps3 for the same price or maybe we should just take this literally and this is gonna reveal a brand new

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:57.220
Console rumble feature, you know, that'll actually rumble the console when the games played, you know, well, that's that

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:03.500
As yet to be seen but the bottom line is this rock stars basically leaning towards the side of you know

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:09.720
It's basically the carrot in the stick the carrot, you know the stick being Microsoft the carrot being the money

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.860
So you have to they're looking at the numbers right now, and they're trying to get to you know

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:20.740
What's this about a stick and a carrot? I've seen the 360 is something that you know, they'll make a lot more money than

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:25.580
The ps3 they just you know, I guess that's how the way it goes. I

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.640
Guess so, I guess that's the way it goes. I just heard stick and a carrot

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.060
Well, yeah, because you know Microsoft being the you know

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:41.220
Microsoft being the the stick and then the carrot being the money. Hey dark Sakura

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:44.600
What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.460
My ass

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.860
All right

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.300
What?

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.380
Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference. I haven't seen you are a loser. All right. Sorry Zaku. I'm sorry

01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:00.620
I couldn't keep everybody on topic. But mm-hmm granted. I just I'm yeah

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:03.900
I don't want to debate the Sony Microsoft thing anymore, you know

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.540
You have to look at but you have to look at the writing on the wall

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:12.540
The rock stars basically is gonna start you're just gonna have to start leaning towards one one side over another

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.020
Regardless of you know, regardless of what's already been done in the past

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:21.900
It's and by extending the game beyond beyond the disc Zaku

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.300
It's just a crazy cycle

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:28.540
The companies are gonna release the game on the console that has the most

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.540
Number of machines in the market but the company's console that's gonna have the most number of machines in the market

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:37.320
It's gonna be the one that has the good games on it. So it all comes down to first-party games

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.540
It all comes down to the first-party games

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:44.460
Exactly. Rockstar knows that 360 has a bigger install base in the ps3

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:48.620
that it granted that the the 360 had a one-year head start and

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:52.060
You know, they didn't they didn't blow they didn't take it for granted

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.500
So yeah, this is good. You know, it's just that they're saying, you know

01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:02.860
Rockstar is just bullshitting when they're saying that their version their ps3 version of GTA 4 is actually going to move consoles

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:09.740
We shall see what happens. It's just it it doesn't make sense. All right. Well, thank you very much for the call Zaku

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:12.340
We gotta get some more calls. Mm-hmm. Bye. Bye. All right

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:16.560
Orange launch radio on Skype one eight seven seven game

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:23.060
Olr some comments from chat room GS 191 says shit at the end of the day take to interactive is gonna make a shit ton

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:26.620
Of money anyway, you know to buy their stock before grand theft auto for release

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.900
I hope the game tanks just to piss you all off. I don't care of it tanks

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:36.580
I don't give a shit about their stocks. It's gonna be awesome. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hello. This is dr. Nah

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.780
Hi, dr. Nah, what's on your mind?

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:45.460
I just wanted to prove to all the other guys listening that you can actually get a call in if you try hard enough

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:49.700
That's right. You just gotta hammering the line and you can get in. Well, I'm glad I'm glad you got it

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700
You have you called her show before?

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.220
No

01:04:53.220 --> 01:05:00.260
Never. Well, I just thought this is my second show listening live from Mexico City. Oh, well, welcome

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:05.260
We like the world listeners. That's always fun house house house things going in Mexico City

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.780
How's the gaming scene in a place like Mexico City?

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:13.940
well, it's pretty much like Southern California which where I've been a ton of times and

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:21.500
Pretty much. All you have to do is get a lot of games and there's really not that many people playing live

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.660
I'd have to play with a bunch of guys from the u.s. So

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.300
That's why I'm here

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:31.340
There you go. Well, hey you meet a lot of a lot of folks here like to play with folks around the world

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:35.540
It's good times. What what type of games have you been playing recently? Oh

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:43.660
Sadly not the kind of game that I like. I like role-playing games, but there's not that many more out there

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.820
So right now I'm pretty much playing shoot-em-ups. So the shadow runs in my latest failure

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:55.100
You like me must be more excited about eternal Sonata than Halo 3

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.660
Very much. So yeah, exactly right. What else did you want to comment on tonight, buddy?

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:07.300
Well, just letting all the other listeners know for life that I just would not trade my spouse on any

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.220
on any TV show

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.900
Are you actually married I

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.540
Married, I have a couple of kids. So it's a pretty interesting gaming scene

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:21.300
Well, I fortunately I don't think you could apply for the show because the whole you know

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.260
You're in another country and I think that that brings a whole nother issue into it

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.260
But you're saying you wouldn't trade your right wife for anything

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.060
No, and

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.260
That's already given since

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:38.020
Both my kids are starting into video games and there are only three and five. So what kind of games are you letting the kids play?

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.140
Mostly we I got him a we and I have a bunch of games

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:48.220
For kids basically anything rated E. I have Shrek I have

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:54.700
Monster Saint that kind of games, you know, um, there was this guy I ran into at Fry's the other day

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:59.620
And he was looking he was looking at the Wii games and he overheard myself and I think Shane talking to each other

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:03.420
About the different games and he could tell that we kind of you know knew stuff about games

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:08.300
So he actually came up and asked me he's like what would be a good Wii game for me to get for the family

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:12.660
I'm like, well who's playing the Wii you or the kids and he said kind of something for all of us

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:17.860
So I recommended Ella bits and worry aware. Was that a good suggestion? I don't know

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.660
I couldn't think because at first I said well Zelda's the best game on the Wii

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:26.260
But I don't know if young kids would really get into that so much. So I said Ella bits and worry aware

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.820
Warrior where is good?

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.820
Excite truck. Yeah

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.740
Yeah

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:38.340
By cities, that's your suggestion right Loki. I don't know what they don't have by city on the Wii

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.700
It's our face Godfather

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.700
No, Scarfy no trauma center get them started on the path to surgery early

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.380
I said trauma centers a really fun game, but I don't think kids

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:52.620
I like I just like watching the patients bleed because I'm no good at it

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:58.180
But you know, it's funny. You said you wouldn't trade your wife for anything. I wouldn't inflict my husband on anyone else

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:04.780
That's nice, there you go. Well, dr. Nard thanks so much for calling in

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:09.220
We appreciate hearing from you and I don't know if they celebrated in Mexico, but Happy Father's Day. Nonetheless

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:11.460
Thank you. That's it. All right

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.100
All right. See you later. Take care. Thanks for calling. Bye. Bye. Bye

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.300
JV Mon's yelling at me in chat 1 8 7 7 game. Oh LR

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:24.340
We have time for a couple more calls JV Mon's yelling at me in chat saying

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.460
awesome in JV, huh

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:36.500
Zelda is so not the best game on the Wii. Zelda was so boring boring ass gameplay and JV Mon says sky

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.020
I'm always yelling at you, which is true, but he bought me dinner in New York. So all is forgiven

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:45.580
If you go meet the listeners, they'll buy you things. It's awesome

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:48.380
I don't think they can spend that much money

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.580
No, I can't what do I do I look like I'm made of money you make more than I do

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:58.520
I can bear whatever I can barely afford my own plenty. I've debt make your make your work pay for me to go

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:04.100
Sure, I'll do that. I'll do just that. Let's go to the phones and take at least one more call here

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:10.220
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this? Hey guys, it's insane. Hello

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:15.300
I'm going insane. Just be thinking about you. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:24.620
Nothing you may all notice that I found a lot like and then when I'm not DMN, okay, so the very output

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:29.700
Jamie took a ps3 and wasn't him to death. It was a horrible funeral

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:38.220
So you have officially retired or killed off DMN and now we have insane us. That's dead. Okay. Yes, I have I

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.180
That's your prerogative. You know Madonna wants everybody to call her Esther

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.400
You have every right and Prince wanted everybody to call him. I'd symbols

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.460
In Prince's a defense

01:09:53.460 --> 01:10:00.820
And it was had to do with the fact that his previous label owned the name Prince so use the symbol in terms of protest

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:05.580
Until the contract goes up and could get his thing again. Has this show really come to discussing Prince?

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:08.780
That's a new album

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:16.100
Crocheted assless pants and that's bravery. This is what it sounds like when I cry anyways

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:20.420
Rob you need to explain something to your listeners, okay?

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:25.860
That you're not doing orange on his radio anymore. I'm looking at this press release from CBS right here

01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.340
And apparently you're the new host of the price is right. I

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:38.300
Freaking wish but unfortunately, I was here. No, no, let me let me let me read let me read this

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.820
according to two years of

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:48.220
Auditions tryouts and everything we have selected Rob Roberts as to be the new host of the price is right

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.980
His audition tape said it all he showed so much emotion when doing his tapes audition

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:58.260
In fact half of the five-minute tape was him crying because he was so nervous of doing this

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:05.100
we think that this emotion will show will show perfectly or the new host of the price is right and

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:13.700
We will have somebody more feminine than marker duties, I I don't know what to say insanest but

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:18.700
A Plinko just moves me to tears. I'm

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:26.740
Actually calling to raise some beef over the Church of England versus Sony

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.660
Sorry, I'm just a little bit of a price is right

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.860
bastard religion

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.020
Wait, let's get into the music you listen

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.020
See

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:48.500
I wanted to turn the price is right into a gay rave. That's why I was not allowed to host it sadly

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.940
I thought you just wanted you just wanted the sparkling jackets

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.620
Dude rod Roddy was the man don't make fun of rod ready

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:03.300
Anyway, sorry about that. I was actually gonna call the CBS executive. I'm just too fucking tired

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.300
But

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:10.500
I am up in arms over the Sony versus Church of England thing and how Sony is taking

01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.980
whole thing

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:20.140
Initially, they weren't taking it seriously at all. They're saying oh, we're talking to the Church of England and Church of England was like, um, no

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:29.460
No one's talking I think the Church of England's demands are a little bit harsh they want resistance fall man to be

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:36.260
Completely removed from the shelves and for them to completely redesign the level that the Church of Manchester then. Mm-hmm

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.820
I don't agree with that

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.940
As much as I would love Sony to burn out

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.940
I

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.940
Would it's kind of a it's a it's a height of man

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:59.340
I understand it's only the business and they're saying oh like the building whatever

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:08.300
Last I checked. I don't think buildings have lightness, right? Yeah, and you know, isn't it kind of common to see famous landmarks in video games

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:12.940
I mean how many games are out there that involve the White House, you know that you know

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:17.980
Like in that alien shooting game was destroy all humans. You could blow up the White House, you know

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:23.500
Or how about all the movies out there that have you know, New York City real story?

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.180
Well, but usually though in a lot of those you're getting the permits to shoot at those locations

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:31.820
But I guess not always because sometimes they shoot in Canada and make it look like the u.s

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:38.180
Certain landmarks they do that channel game. It takes place in a fictional future that I

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:45.180
Agreed there the church has somewhat of their panties in a bunch, but you know, it wouldn't pain Sony to go

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:48.900
Look, sorry, we pissed you off our bad, but we're not going to recall the game bill

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.220
Sorry that you're offended by this fuck off

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.380
What would you like to see happen as a resolution insanest

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.060
I would I would just like to see you know

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.100
the church of England saying oh

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:09.320
You should donate some money to a gun control education fund because those of you who aren't aware

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:15.520
Where Manchester England is a horrible horrible gun problem. Um, I want to say a month and a half two months ago

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:22.200
A 15 year old kid was killed taken identity. It was a gun crime. The kid got killed execution style. It was

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.440
Not something you like reading well then that

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.640
That's very unfortunate and that sounds like a very fair resolution as well

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.080
You know that Sony donates a little money to charity all as well kiss and make up

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.320
Yes

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:43.840
But that's about it on that. Um, I would like to plug the insaneest hour. It's not STFU

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.440
It's me making fun of stuff and swearing for an hour and playing music

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.760
and there you go Ashley and we should say it here on the show this all kind of went down while I

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.880
Was out of town and while the rest of us were on vacation, but STFU finally did

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.680
Unfortunately, so we're sad to see it go, but that's all right

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.960
It was over things with my employer who as I've been adamant will remain nameless. Yep

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:13.320
So they're so I'm sorry. I'm sorry to see the STFU finally had to but hey, it was a good run

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.080
You know, you still had some bigger names on STFU than we have in the five years of Orange Lounge radio

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.680
And we're not we're not having anybody on like people think we're gonna have like these big surprise guests on next week

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.880
There are no guests next week. Actually, there's nobody come out next week. I

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:33.880
Was actually gonna come next week. I had things come down where the checkbook said no

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.200
I know it's it's you know money happens. No, it's okay

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.680
I think we're at a point now where we're actually gonna have no guests and that's kind of how we're gonna do it

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.980
It's just gonna be the three of us next week

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.160
But I'll tell you more about what's gonna happen next week a little later in the show. So well fine

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.040
Why don't you just act like you're better than everybody and clamp yourself in your stupid?

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:55.800
Orange Lounge room and do your own radio show for your fifth year anniversary and not share it with anybody else

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:02.680
Oh, wait, you're radio. Yeah, I'll do that actually and you know how else I can assert that I'm better than you insaneist

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:09.120
You're about to hang up on me. Yep. All right. Let's if you want to give us a call Orange Lounge radio on Skype

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.160
1877 game olr. We'll do one more call. I'm such a dick

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.000
But it's insaneist or DMN or whatever, you know, then the symbol he's have a symbol

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.460
There whatever you want to call him. Oh, yeah. No one his name is

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:28.860
a swirly polka dots swirly polka dots Sega swirl is this new name actually Sega swirl

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:35.540
Are we we're not actually getting any more calls. It looks like so maybe maybe that's it

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:39.900
I got a private message from insaneist. Oh, I got a heart. I got a less than three. Yay

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:44.420
Alright, well then I guess that's it since no more calls are coming in. We'll go ahead and close up the skype line

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.180
We had a lot of calls tonight. Anyway, I just thought I saw some other numbers popping up, but they must have stopped trying

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.660
So that's about it. We're gonna wrap things up

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:57.820
Let's go around and first ask if there's any last-minute stories anything last-minute that wants to be brought up tonight

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:00.540
Loki usually have something. Yes, I do

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:08.640
Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out Diablo is getting the movie

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.100
Apparently

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:18.260
Legendary pictures their website is listing Diablo movie as in development as

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.580
As well as a clash of the Titans remake. Oh lord

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:27.040
And they will they have the really bad dubbing like the world warcraft film. So, uh

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.780
Excellent

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:35.140
Let's see what else then again legendary pictures did the new Batman didn't they?

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:40.980
Yeah, it's like a pretty fucking rad movie. So I you know, this may not be the end of the world

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:46.140
Well with the halo 3 beta ending something else had to take its place, right?

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:52.020
well going outside halo 3's viral marketing campaign has taken its place and

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.620
Hello or move over I love bees and welcome

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:04.540
Adjundant reflex and it's apparently this weird viral marketing campaign that they have going on clean people

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.540
you know staying in the street with signs and

01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:11.780
Websites with calendars and whatnot. So if you want more info on that

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:18.780
See, why are they standing in the street with signs the people that are waiting for halo 3 are playing Gears of War while they're waiting

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:23.860
Well, they're not outside. This is part of the viral marketing campaign. So yeah

01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:26.820
Ace combat 6 is getting a limited edition

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:33.180
Flightsick bundle that's gonna be coming out their team Bandai and Hori are teaming up to release

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:40.820
It's gonna have this really elaborate flight stick, which I'm unaware of works for any other game other than Ace combat 6. So

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.420
I might be looking at a what was it? Another mecha not mecha saw them

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.260
Jamie help me here

01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:50.260
stupid game with a very large

01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.100
control stick

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.100
Mecha, oh

01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.100
So but yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.660
And then this rumor just won't die

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.640
apparently Matt Casamani from

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:10.080
IGN posted a while back about halo on the DS. Well, apparently in their latest podcast

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:17.640
They said it's a real game. We're gonna lay down some ownage next week or soon afterwards showing you guys that it's a real game. So

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.560
IGN will probably have info about halo DS

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.400
Soon what the hell?

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.720
And I thoughts exactly

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.960
Yeah, that's all I have is cares. I

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.760
I

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:37.320
Mean like they're they're like, I don't know to me the way you read that and I don't know if that's the way you poster

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.920
If you bell short, but it sounds like they're like kind of just like they're like

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:46.640
We've got a big cock cuz we knew that halo was really on the DS and we're gonna prove it

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:49.640
I mean who cares if the game never came out. I

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:54.280
Mean why I'm supposed to look at like oh look how this game was almost like completely bad

01:19:54.280 --> 01:20:01.040
Well, in other news, there's a video of Diablo for the Game Boy online. So I heard about that, you know, whatever all

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.840
right

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.840
Dar sucker you have anything last minute?

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.520
I'm sorry, is this show not living up to your expectations tonight?

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.080
I had a headache most of the show is this just oh, I'm sorry to hear that

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:20.940
Because your body screamed in my ear both of you take two of these on neupron little you know different

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.740
I needed the Wayne's World reference version

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:29.840
Because the other one was little yellow different better was the real commercial anyhow

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:35.620
And what happened to new print now? I think I was reading up on it on Wikipedia once

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:38.260
I think they got bought by somebody else, but I don't care anymore. I don't care enough

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.820
Anyhow, let's talk about next week since we're at the end of the show

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.940
I'm next week is our fifth anniversary show and for the fifth anniversary show

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:50.340
It's just going to be Loki dark soccer and myself. We're not gonna have any special guests this week

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:55.020
We're gonna kind of celebrate our fifth year anniversary by doing nothing because it's what we do best

01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.900
beer

01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.240
There might be a little bit of liquid celebration

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.880
But no actually the other thing we're gonna do is that you know

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:06.540
We were actually bouncing some ideas around we were gonna use some of our ties to try and get some big names on the show

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:11.240
But we figure now why not? Well, we'll save that for later on down the line and through the summer and stuff. So

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:16.780
what we're gonna do next week is that for part a we're gonna do our normal gaming show and do the

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.780
The

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:22.800
Usual gaming news and everything that we usually do but part B

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:28.880
What we're gonna do next week is we're gonna open up the skype line for all of part B because orange lounge radio

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:35.320
You know when we started we were all about interaction remember kind of like the way we always talked about our show

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.880
Is that if we'll remember like when we used to go play DDR?

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.780
We would go to Brookfield's after and sit around and talk shit and talk about games and such games cool that

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.060
Orange lounge radio is but on the radio

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:50.700
So for part B, we're gonna get out the dinner table. Like we're at Denny's or whatever diner

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:57.140
We'll just order some pizza pizza and we're gonna open up the skype line and we're gonna have you guys call in and just talk

01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:02.700
Shit with us for a few hours about games and everything. And if you guys want to pass on your congratulations, that's cool, too

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:06.980
Whatever you want to do for, you know, it's gonna be your man. I remember the first show though

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.540
I know some good times. I was in this chair

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:17.360
Uh-huh passed out with a migraine and the second show man, that was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:22.720
And patrese is in chat and says yay. We can hear the same three people for an hour

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.860
Well, we're hoping that that won't happen

01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:30.860
We're actually kind of hoping that maybe some folks might drive drop in on the skype line that you wouldn't expect

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:35.980
So who knows we're hoping to get some callers. We may not usually get on the program. That's

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:40.860
What we're looking at for next week to get this guy from the sky. That'd be funny possibly

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.180
I mean who knows who's gonna call in next week, so

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:44.860
We'll see

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.500
We're gonna put the call out there

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:50.360
But we do want our listeners to get in on it too because even those folks that have

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:54.400
Even the same three people that always call in definitely make this show a part of what it is

01:22:54.660 --> 01:23:00.040
So if you've never listened live before and you want to get in next week is an excellent chance to do that again

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:05.860
We tape live at six o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our life 365 station more information can be found at orange lounge

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:13.220
Radio calm I do I do know that next week's discussion will be quite interesting after all we are getting close to e3

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:18.840
Are you saying that even though you got slapped on the wrist about something a while ago?

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:25.260
Possibly next week. You're gonna spill some big-ass beans. I don't know. Maybe maybe thinking about it

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:30.340
It's cross my mind across your mind. Stay tuned. That could be fun. All right

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:32.900
anyhow

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:38.140
We're gonna wrap it up for this week. Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and listening to orange lounge radio

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:40.140
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:44.580
Explicit sorry, we didn't have like a fourth mic or something to get in on the action more often

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:47.220
well, we appreciate you being here as always it's all good and

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:50.180
Again, keep it up with the Wii cosplay and whatever

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.980
Creative cosplays you come up with

01:23:53.300 --> 01:24:00.300
It'll show up an anime Expo and sack anime as well. Awesome. When is sack anime? It's July 13th through 15th

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:06.460
We want to make an appearance somehow. So I'm gonna be there. Yeah, I want to be staff there now

01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:09.680
Can we do a panel or something? Yeah, get us panel. I'll see what I can do

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.380
I'll tell you to um, I'll talk to the management and tell me no internet celebrities

01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:19.700
I'll put it up about I think don't lie. They trust me, but they trust me a lot now. So, all right, sounds good

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.520
Exactly you want to ruin your rep real fast

01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:29.420
I'm a good rep. I'm a good rep with this is really really disgusting. All right, I know

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:30.540
uh

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:35.700
Loki your final thought it smells bad. Stay tuned for the afterbirth

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:41.140
That's my final thought if you're listening live. Otherwise, you're seeing live dark soccer

01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:47.140
I feel really stupid because I deleted almost everything out of my FTP including in the banner for my live journals

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.860
I have to go home and re-upload it

01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:52.120
It's like the via was dying. So in three days I get in my

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:59.300
Computer that was given to me by vandalism is going to be up and running and I need to think of a clever name for

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:00.300
it

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.700
um, my final thought is

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:09.700
Now I want ice cream I didn't want ice cream a couple hours ago, but now I have chocolate mint pudding at home

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:12.220
Mmm, sounds good
