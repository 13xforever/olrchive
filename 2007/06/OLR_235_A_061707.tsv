0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roko
14000	20000	Tonight, June 17th, 2007, SoulCalibur preps its fourth game for the Playstation 3 and 360
20000	25000	Sony builds itself a blog, and has Project Hammer gotten some nails in its coffin?
25000	28000	Orange Lounge Radio
56000	58000	Ripping it off and beating you with it, maybe?
62000	66000	It happened in Shaun of the Dead, except they ripped off his legs and then went after zombies with him.
66000	68000	That was the best scene in the movie.
69000	71000	Who hasn't seen Shaun of the Dead yet?
71000	73000	Go see hot fuzz, everybody, by the way.
73000	75000	Here goes the chatroom going, me, me, me.
75000	77000	Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
77000	79000	Hello.
79000	80000	Have you seen Shaun of the Dead, Loki?
80000	82000	Um, twice.
82000	87000	It's good times. I have to admit when DarkSakura, you know, because she does movie nights once in a while at her place,
87000	93000	and I admit when she first was like, let's watch Shaun of the Dead, I was like, oh god, alright, fine, we'll watch a movie.
93000	95000	It's only two hours. It was actually really good.
95000	101000	I don't know if you were there a couple years ago, but we did Shaun of the Dead and then we watched the new Dawn of the Dead.
101000	105000	Actually, I think it was in the reverse. We watched the new Dawn of the Dead and then Shaun of the Dead.
105000	108000	I wasn't there because I never saw the new Dawn of the Dead.
108000	112000	The new Dawn of the Dead sucked. Shaun of the Dead was awesome, though, and hot fuzz is better.
112000	113000	I still haven't seen hot fuzz.
113000	114000	Hot fuzz is great. I've seen it twice now.
114000	116000	I've seen it twice.
116000	118000	Well, give me one of yours.
118000	120000	I went to see it with Ranma.
120000	121000	I seriously can't remember the last.
121000	123000	That's right.
123000	126000	When we left, you guys went to movie transformers early.
126000	127000	Do you?
127000	128000	Before it comes out.
128000	129000	Lucky you. How do you explain that?
129000	130000	Through work stuff?
130000	131000	Yeah, through work.
131000	132000	Oh, very nice.
132000	133000	A few days.
133000	134000	I can't wait.
134000	135000	Are we a movie podcast?
135000	139000	Hey, they're making a game based on it, and it's going to be fucking awesome.
139000	142000	And they should make a game out of Shaun of the Dead, shouldn't they?
142000	143000	They should.
143000	144000	Absolutely.
144000	145000	Hot fuzz would be funny, too.
145000	147000	A romantic comedy was Zombies of the Game.
147000	154000	One of these days, I seriously think the last movie I saw in the theater was Notes on a Scandal, which they should not make into a video game.
154000	156000	I don't think that would be a very interesting video game.
156000	157000	Scandal.
157000	161000	You can control Judi Dench as she creates lesbian scandal.
161000	164000	It would be wonderful.
164000	165000	All right, anyhow.
165000	167000	You take notes on it.
167000	169000	You write with your wiimote.
169000	170000	You just write your notes.
170000	172000	Scandal, scandal, scandal, scandal.
172000	174000	All right, anyhow.
174000	180000	Happy Father's Day, also, to any dads that are listening to our program, as it is Father's Day today.
180000	184000	I know we have some daddy gamers, so congrats to all of you folks.
184000	186000	I hope you're having a great day.
186000	188000	So, just wanted to get that out there.
188000	191000	Let's get into the show and talk about our gaming weeks.
191000	193000	Start off, Dark Sakura.
193000	196000	How was your gaming week?
196000	201000	Well, I've been spending the whole week looking for my copy of Elite Beat Agents, because Dan wants to play it,
201000	212000	and playing some World of Warcraft, like hardly any, because I still want Burning Crusade so I can play a hot little elf.
212000	213000	Very cool.
213000	215000	You still haven't gotten Burning Crusade?
215000	217000	What money do I have, Rob?
217000	218000	I don't know.
218000	221000	You certainly don't get paid for this, so I don't know.
221000	224000	Yeah, I don't have much money, so no.
224000	225000	Oh, sorry to hear it.
225000	227000	Unless someone in the chat room wants to buy it for me.
227000	228000	Sell a pinball machine.
228000	229000	They're not mine.
229000	230000	Oh, okay.
230000	231000	They're the spouses.
231000	233000	I see.
233000	234000	All right.
234000	236000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
236000	238000	Full of stuff.
238000	249000	Actually, I played, I tried to catch up on demos on Xbox Live, so I tried Overlord, and that was pretty fun.
249000	252000	I guess people keep comparing it to Fable, although I've never played Fable.
252000	253000	Surprising.
253000	258000	I'm going to play Fable 2, though, but haven't played the original Fable, so I guess it's similar to that, but it's kind of fun.
258000	260000	You get to control little gremlin things.
260000	268000	I just want to verify, because I haven't been reading up too much on Fable 2, you will still able to be a bisexual evil warlord, correct?
268000	271000	Yes, and you can get pregnant.
271000	273000	If I'm a male, that might be difficult.
273000	274000	Yeah, that might be difficult.
274000	275000	All right.
275000	276000	Yeah, but...
276000	277000	So...
277000	278000	That would be a real Fable right there.
278000	279000	Yeah.
279000	282000	There once was a pregnant man.
282000	289000	They definitely do not, like, I don't know, they blatantly ripped off gremlins.
289000	293000	I mean, these creatures are so gremlin-like, they are gremlins.
293000	294000	Do they sing?
294000	296000	Yes, they do, and actually...
296000	297000	That's great.
297000	302000	And they can attack sheep, and that's what you have them do a lot, is attack things, and that's kind of cool.
302000	307000	And it's sort of like Fable, where you can be good and evil, except you have the choice of being evil or eviler.
307000	311000	I want to be uber evil.
311000	313000	So it's actually pretty cool.
313000	318000	The other game I played was Monster Madness, and now this game I was kind of looking forward to check out,
318000	322000	because it reminded me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and who doesn't like Zombies Ate My Neighbors?
322000	326000	This game is no Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and it's awful.
326000	331000	The controls in it, awful, and it's way too damn hard, so I don't recommend it at all.
331000	338000	The other games I played, Mad Tracks, I actually tried that out a little bit, and that was pretty fun.
338000	341000	I played through a few levels of that, although there really isn't too much to the game.
341000	347000	You can probably beat it pretty quick, so they're kind of trying to sell those additional add-ons for it.
347000	349000	I don't know, not my thing.
349000	352000	Didn't play Pac-Man Championship Edition.
352000	355000	I looked at it, downloaded the demo, so I haven't played it yet.
355000	357000	But it's Pac-Man.
357000	359000	Oh, I'm sorry, it's a sequel to Pac-Man.
359000	361000	I have more to say on this, but I'll wait my turn.
361000	362000	Yeah, Dan downloaded that.
362000	364000	I was like, okay, what the hell?
364000	369000	He was like, I came home, and all I was doing was freaking screaming at the ghosts.
369000	371000	Doesn't he do that all the time?
371000	372000	He was really screaming at me.
372000	374000	He was calling them bastards.
374000	377000	I was like, dude, you sound like me talking to my computer.
377000	383000	And then, I downloaded the Project Silphie demo today, but I forgot to play that.
383000	387000	I finished Super Paper Mario.
387000	388000	Congrats.
388000	394000	Yeah, the end is like, you saw it coming throughout the entire game, and it's just like, once
394000	396000	you finish it, you're rewarded with, hey, guess what?
396000	398000	Don't you fucking spoil it.
398000	399000	No, I'm not going to spoil it.
399000	402000	I'm just saying, once you finish the game, you're rewarded with, hey, you get to go back
402000	406000	to this one level and fight a hundred people, and it'll take another couple hours.
406000	407000	Fuck you.
407000	408000	I mean, it's awful.
408000	412000	That's what the whole game is, is full of this like, fight a hundred people, do that
412000	413000	for two hours.
413000	416000	So, are you saying at the end of the game, you get told, we're sorry, Mario, but our
416000	417000	princess is in another castle?
417000	418000	No, it's more like...
418000	421000	We're sorry, Mario, but your game sucks.
421000	425000	It's more like, thank you for playing through the game, no replay value whatsoever, sell
425000	426000	it back to GameStop.
426000	427000	Thank you very much.
427000	430000	So, that's pretty much what I'm going to have to do.
430000	432000	I did download Zelda 2.
432000	434000	I don't know why, but I've actually been playing this game.
434000	436000	You can lend it to me before you sell it back.
436000	438000	You can borrow my copy.
438000	439000	I'm not playing it.
439000	441000	If you really want to play it, I'll lend you mine.
441000	442000	It's a great game.
442000	446000	It's just, you know, after you've played through all of it, it's just kind of, eh.
446000	450000	There's a bunch of side quests you can do that have no reward whatsoever.
450000	451000	What?
451000	452000	Zelda 2?
452000	453000	No, not Zelda 2.
453000	454000	I'm talking about Super Mario.
454000	455000	No, Zelda 2 is awesome.
455000	456000	I was like, Zelda 2 is fucking rad.
456000	457000	I don't know why people diss it.
457000	458600	It's like one of the worst in the series.
458600	459600	It's great.
459600	460600	It's really fucking weird.
460600	463200	Go play Wand of Gamelon if you want to see the worst ones in the series, okay?
463200	465120	It doesn't feel like Zelda at all.
465120	469760	It's just very strange, and I remember playing through it and it being very hard.
469760	474160	It still is kind of hard, but I don't know, I can understand it more.
474160	477440	Why did the name of everything really strange names is beyond me?
477440	478440	I am Error.
478440	479440	Yeah, I remember that.
479440	481440	I went in and I'm like, oh, there's that.
481440	488000	I think that was actually supposed to have been something else, and it programmed in
488000	489520	wrong, if I remember right.
489520	490520	Really?
490520	491520	With the translation.
491520	492520	Huh.
492520	493520	I want that on a shirt.
493520	494520	I am Error.
494520	496120	There's got to be a shirt somewhere.
496120	497120	I'm sure there is.
497120	498520	You can just have one made, you know.
498520	499840	Maybe his name is just Error.
499840	500840	I mean...
500840	502720	I'm going to name my firstborn Error.
502720	504440	I mean, fucking look at that.
504440	509800	That would be a horrible thing for parents to do to name their baby Error.
509800	514000	With the middle name Oops.
514000	515880	Error Oops Summers.
515880	517280	Love it.
517280	521800	Then finally, the last game I've been playing, and this is weird because I've actually played
521800	526320	this game more than I played Guitar Hero, but it uses the Guitar Hero controller for
526320	530320	the 360, and it's a game for the PC called Fret Nice.
530320	536320	The best way to describe it is it's like playing Loco Roco with a guitar, and it actually works
536320	537320	pretty well.
537320	540200	They've got some really interesting level designs and stuff.
540200	545480	The only bad thing about it is it's only three levels long, but it's a lot of fun, so I recommend
545480	546480	downloading that.
546480	552640	I may post a link to it in my blog on all games so that you can actually find it, because
552640	559560	it's on some foreign website or something, but it's cool, and it's free, so I highly
559560	562080	recommend doing that.
562080	563080	I don't know.
563080	565540	I don't play the Guitar Hero.
565540	566540	It's weird.
566540	574600	We did this thing on Friday last week that it was basically the sales team building thing,
574600	581280	and we had to perform songs on stage, and they have video of it, but anyways, they had
581280	585080	like one person had the Air Guitar, so I had to do the Air Guitar part of it because I
585080	586520	didn't want to sing.
586520	591320	You know how my issues are with singing, so I did that, and everyone was like, oh, you're
591320	592320	so good at that.
592320	594560	Maybe it's because you play Guitar Hero all the time.
594560	596120	I'm like, I don't play Guitar Hero.
596120	597120	I bought the game.
597120	598760	I don't play it.
598760	602440	Everyone just has this weird, I don't know.
602440	605960	Because I own the game, they figure that I play it a lot or something, or because I'm
605960	611200	a gamer, oh, I must have played Guitar Hero a lot, or because you were on the internet
611200	613120	radio program about music video games.
613120	618600	Therefore you can pass every catastrophic in DDR in the group.
618600	623240	Back in the day, I wasn't so fat.
623240	627640	That's what it boils down to, because I played more DDR.
627640	628640	Exactly.
628640	634800	Then you get married, and you don't have DDR time, and it all goes downhill from there.
634800	637240	Anything else about your gaming week you want to share?
637240	641640	Oh yeah, I played more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
641640	642640	Congratulations.
642640	647600	I got my last copy of Saints Row, and so we're going to be landing those five systems together
647600	648600	very soon.
648600	649600	Very cool.
649600	651960	Just in time for the sequel, maybe?
651960	656520	Saints Row 2, that's not coming down for a while, but hopefully in time for Grand Theft
656520	657520	Auto 4.
657520	660960	Actually, we know it's going to be in time for Grand Theft Auto 4, that's why we're building
660960	661960	it.
661960	662960	All right.
662960	663960	Let's see, my gaming week.
663960	666240	I also played Pac-Man Championship Edition.
666240	668160	I was gone, obviously, for two weeks.
668160	672160	I went to New York City, and actually I want to start off by giving a big shout out to
672160	675760	those folks that actually came and met up with me on Sunday.
675760	678800	About the time we would have usually done Orange on the Radio, I was hanging out with
678800	681800	some of our listeners in New York City, and that was a great time.
681800	684800	We actually went to Dave & Buster's in Times Square, and just kind of messed around there
684800	690080	a little for a little while, and played this game called Jumpin' Jackpot, which is hilarious.
690080	693520	They have one of these at Roseville Golf Land, actually it's the virtual jump rope with the
693520	700140	lights going around, and it plays this really super gay rave music while you're jumping.
700140	702100	But it's hard, and it's crack.
702100	704000	You keep putting money in over and over.
704000	707720	And we played some DDR, they had Superdome, we were playing a bunch of stuff, and it was
707720	708720	a good time.
708720	710120	What are you laughing at?
710120	712120	Did somebody link that in chat room?
712120	714640	Chat.orangelandradio.com if you want to join the chat room.
714640	715640	What is this?
715640	716640	This is VG Cats?
716640	718280	No, Digital Unrest is what this is.
718280	719800	Sounds kind of like VG Cats, though.
719800	720800	Link that in chat.
720800	721800	Someone already did.
721800	724440	Oh, okay.
724440	725440	Very nice.
725440	726980	Oh, because they actually had a baby.
726980	727980	Very nice.
727980	728980	Yeah.
728980	729980	All right.
729980	731400	For those of you guys listening to us on the podcast, there's just more incentive to
731400	732400	listen live.
732400	733920	Digital Unrest comic.
733920	735320	Just search for the Error comic.
735320	736320	It's great.
736320	739960	Anyhow, damn it, you interrupted my story, woman.
739960	741320	Yes!
741320	742320	Dave and Busters.
742320	745320	You know, I have enough tickets to buy an Xbox 360 game, but I'm just not interested
745320	746680	in anything that they have there.
746680	750960	Anyhow, so big thanks to all the listeners who showed up.
750960	755560	Also went, Ranma took me to this video game shop, or I think he was the one that led the
755560	756560	way.
756560	757560	I mean, all of us kind of went there.
757560	759160	All of us that were still together at this time.
759160	763880	We went to this video game shop near Astor Place, where the big cube is, and they had
763880	764880	like tons of stuff.
764880	768280	Like I sent you the picture of the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and all these import stuff, but
768280	773560	they were selling old school NES games, and my friend has an old school Nintendo.
773560	777640	The date Wednesday we set aside just to recuperate from Jetlag, I actually played through an
777640	780160	original Metroid cartridge all the way from start to finish.
780160	781160	It was so awesome.
781160	782160	I love Metroid.
782160	785760	I forgot how much I missed that game, but I actually bought her a copy of the Guardian
785760	787520	Legend from this store that we found.
787520	790520	Yeah, I got to push your propaganda on everybody.
790520	792760	$15 to buy that game.
792760	793760	They still don't.
793760	794760	That's not bad.
794760	795760	Yeah, I know.
795760	797040	They're charging a lot for the old NES games now.
797040	799240	It's like they've gone up in value.
799240	800240	So it's very interesting.
800240	801240	Was it in the box?
801240	802240	No.
802240	803480	It was just the cart and the black slate.
803480	806400	When I bought mine, I paid $10, and I got it in the box.
806400	808240	But I got her an original cartridge of Guardian Legends.
808240	809240	That made me happy.
809240	810720	Completely unopened.
810720	811720	That's nice.
811720	812720	Yeah, my Guardian Legend.
812720	816040	I opened it to play it, of course.
816040	817560	There you go.
817560	819040	So yeah, I got her a copy of Guardian Legend.
819040	822880	I should have just took it home with me, but I don't have an old school Nintendo here.
822880	825160	I'm holding out hope they will put it on Virtual Console eventually.
825160	826160	Rob!
826160	827160	What?
827160	828160	Who do you know in this room who has five Nintendos?
828160	830160	Are you going to give me one?
830160	831160	Probably.
831160	832160	I could.
832160	833160	Sweet!
833160	834160	Let me talk to Dan.
834160	836240	Then maybe I'm going to send Amanda back to that store and give me more games.
836240	838120	Just buy a Generation Next.
838120	840040	Oh yeah, we'll talk about that later in the show.
840040	841600	There's this other thing coming out I'll talk about later.
841600	842600	Well, no.
842600	843600	It's already out.
843600	844600	Well, isn't it on the show roll?
844600	845600	No.
845600	846600	It's not something else.
846600	847880	This is the thing we saw at E3 a few years back.
847880	848880	Oh, that thing!
848880	850880	The $20 console thing.
850880	851880	Sixty.
851880	852880	Sixty?
852880	853880	Sixty bucks.
853880	854880	I thought they were only charging people $20.
854880	855880	Was that just at the show?
855880	856880	That was at the show.
856880	857880	No, I see.
857880	858880	You should have bought it at the show.
858880	859880	What the hell?
859880	860880	Oh well.
860880	862760	Anyhow, so yeah, obviously there was some 8-bit gaming goodness.
862760	863760	Dave and Busters.
863760	868720	I finally caved and I got a DS Lite, which, by the way, I saw this story floating around
868720	873440	blogs this week talking about how Nintendo World has these custom DS Lites that you can
873440	875200	buy in all these different colors.
875200	880480	They wanted $280 for those, and the picture that's floating around doesn't show you all
880480	881480	the colors that they have.
881480	885080	I don't know if they added some or what because I distinctly remember there was a green one
885080	887600	because that's the one I wanted to get, and you don't see that one in the pictures that
887600	889560	made it around all the different game blogs.
889560	892960	Check DJ Rama's picture site, which I'm sure he'll link in chat right now.
892960	896480	I think it's djramas.net, and check out his New York City pictures.
896480	899360	He actually took a picture of the case with all the colors and some of the newer ones
899360	900360	that were in there.
900360	902280	It was between that and the fuchsia hot pink one.
902280	906000	I don't remember what the fucking website is, but there is a website out there that
906000	911160	you can buy, custom colored anything, consoles, portable systems.
911160	913120	Two hundred and eighty bucks they wanted for that.
913120	914760	Well, you can buy it cheaper than that.
914760	922600	They sell iPods there, they sell PSPs, DS Lites, everything, and you can get them in
922600	923600	custom colors.
923600	927200	I'm not sure about DS Lites, but I know they sold the original DS on the site.
927200	930640	People just forget that you can do that or just paint it.
930640	931640	I don't know.
931640	934960	You can just get a part and paint the damn thing.
934960	939040	They also do engraving there, and I almost bought my new DS Lite at the Nintendo World
939040	943000	Store to get it engraved, because they'll engrave your DS for only twenty bucks, and
943000	945760	there's all these patterns you can choose from, and I thought that was pretty awesome,
945760	949720	but their engraving machine was broken, so I didn't get to do it.
949720	950720	Sucks to that.
950720	955800	Their engraving machine said I am error.
955800	960240	When I got to Pennsylvania, I was like, well, sales tax is lower here than it is in California.
960240	963160	I was so bored in Pennsylvania, I have to be honest.
963160	966480	No offense to those of you folks that live in the Allentown area where I was at for a
966480	969600	few days, but Lehigh Valley, all that stuff, I was really bored.
969600	972600	So I bought a DS Lite, and I bought Puzzle Quest.
972600	974520	Oh my God, that game is amazing.
974520	976240	It is so addicting.
976240	980720	It's simple, it's just bejeweled, but the whole fact that they threw this competitive
980720	984400	element into it, where you're taking turns, you really have to think about the game a
984400	985400	whole new way.
985400	988040	You can't just go, oh, I'm going to line this up, I'm going to line this up, I'm going to
988040	989040	make a chain, make a chain.
989040	993520	Because you have to line things up, and you don't want your opponent, who's going to go
993520	996000	after you, to be able to line up the skulls.
996000	1001000	Because basically, to explain the game real fast, there's a story that all goes with it.
1001000	1004800	You can cast spells, which are like special moves on the board, but to do that requires
1004800	1005800	mana.
1005800	1008640	And so the stones on the board are red, yellow, blue, and green.
1008640	1013400	And then you also have gold coins, purple experience stars, and skulls.
1013400	1014800	When you line up the coins, you get gold.
1014800	1017660	When you line up the experience stars, you get experience, so you can level up.
1017660	1020840	When you line up the skulls, your opponent takes damage.
1020840	1025000	So it sounds kind of complicated, but if you play Bejeweled, you can pick this game up.
1025000	1030940	And just the fact that they kind of threw that whole twist into it really was innovative.
1030940	1032000	It made the game a lot of fun.
1032000	1036960	So I totally love Puzzle Quest, and I hope they come out with it on Xbox Live Arcade.
1036960	1039360	I hope those rumors are true.
1039360	1043640	Also I picked up Planet Puzzle League, but I haven't played enough of that just yet to
1043640	1045840	really play, to give it a fair response.
1045840	1051600	But I played it once, and I know it's very similar, of course, to Pokemon Puzzle League,
1051600	1052600	but with some new stuff.
1052600	1054440	You totally reminded me of the other game I was playing.
1054440	1055440	What's that?
1055440	1056440	Pokemans!
1056440	1057440	Oh, Pearl and Diamond?
1057440	1058440	Or what do you have, Diamond?
1058440	1059440	I have Pearl.
1059440	1060440	Oh, Pearl?
1060440	1061440	Because I'm being not like everybody else.
1061440	1062440	I have Pearl, too.
1062440	1063440	Bah!
1063440	1064440	You're being like me.
1064440	1065440	Bah!
1065440	1066440	Yourself.
1066440	1067440	No, I'm being different.
1067440	1068440	All right, that's fine.
1068440	1069440	Are you having fun with your Pokemans?
1069440	1070440	At the gym, yes.
1070440	1071440	Right, cool.
1071440	1072440	I've learned the fine art of playing Pokemans on the elliptical.
1072440	1074080	That's a good idea.
1074080	1075080	It's very hard.
1075080	1077080	I've been playing Pokemans a lot of times.
1077080	1080880	Let's see, then also I played Pac-Man Championship Edition, which I thought was great, but the
1080880	1086400	only thing that made me mad about it is that the original Pac-Man that came out a few months
1086400	1091280	ago for five bucks, totally worthless now, unless you really want the authentic arcade
1091280	1092280	experience.
1092280	1095720	Pac-Man CE is really, like, really, ultimately, the two of them should have been released
1095720	1098960	together for ten bucks, and that would have been the most fair deal, I think.
1098960	1103680	If you want the authentic Pac-Man arcade experience, go buy Pac-Man arcade machine.
1103680	1105000	They're probably cheap now.
1105000	1106000	Not really.
1106000	1107000	Really?
1107000	1108000	Are they, like, hot collector's items?
1108000	1111240	You can find them at, um, well, in the Sacramento, Roseville area.
1111240	1112240	You can find them at DiDio's.
1112240	1114800	There's a guy that sells arcade machines.
1114800	1119460	But hundreds or thousands of dollars for an arcade machine, or five bucks on Xbox Live
1119460	1121260	for pretty much the next best thing.
1121260	1122260	I don't know.
1122260	1123260	Hard to tell.
1123260	1125200	I want to see Xbox Live arcades in an arcade.
1125200	1130840	Well, anyway, Pac-Man, I liked Pac-Man Ship, or Pac-Man Championship Edition a lot.
1130840	1132640	I think the game is set up great.
1132640	1137240	Really, it's weird, because you eat the dots, and when all the dots are gone on one half
1137240	1141080	of the screen, a fruit shows up on the other side of the screen, and when you eat the fruit,
1141080	1142080	more dots appear.
1142080	1144940	So you're kind of, like, ping-ponging to both sides of the screen.
1144940	1148200	It's really trippy, and it's got a pretty interesting rave-y soundtrack.
1148200	1151400	What is up with Namco and the rave-y soundtrack games?
1151400	1154080	Namco made that flaming finger game at Dave & Buster's.
1154080	1155560	They made the jump and jackpot game.
1155560	1159920	Namco is, like, there's rave whores that work, like, they're all on ecstasy over there or
1159920	1160920	something.
1160920	1161920	So, whatever.
1161920	1167040	Now, Pac-Man Championship Edition, and also I played Prince of Persia Classic.
1167040	1168040	The game looks beautiful.
1168040	1173360	I mean, the way they redid the graphics, that's the best rehash of the graphics of any game
1173360	1178440	on Xbox Live Arcade, but I didn't end up buying the whole game, because I've played Prince
1178440	1182240	of Persia Classic just so many times, I really wasn't interested in playing through it again.
1182240	1185960	The game can get so frustrating at some points, but it's definitely worth checking out the
1185960	1191520	demo, and if you've never played the Classic game before, it's probably worth a look for
1191520	1192520	a chance.
1192520	1195080	If I remember Prince of Persia, I remember it was fucking hard, and I got frustrated
1195080	1197800	with it really quickly.
1197800	1203000	Checking out the chat room, www.orangelandsradio.com, click on chat, or you can go directly to chat.orangelandsradio.com,
1203000	1204920	we tape live on Sunday nights.
1204920	1211040	Let's see, BlackDevilerX agrees with Loki's, I want to see Xbox Live Arcade in an arcade.
1211040	1213020	I think it'd be cool, they should.
1213020	1218100	TheRobD says, I hate flaming finger, and Jvmon says, flaming finger told Skye to get his
1218100	1219100	flame on.
1219100	1221120	That's right, you know the game said, when you start the game, have you played flaming
1221120	1222320	finger, Dave & Buster's?
1222320	1223960	I watched you play it.
1223960	1225520	I didn't even shake you.
1225520	1227680	You're playing footsie with my hand.
1227680	1232640	Whenever you put your money in the game, whatever it says, get your flame on, which is really
1232640	1236840	funny, because I'm gay, and you know, they say flaming or whatever.
1236840	1243920	Anyway, let's see, looking at what else is going on in chat room, Gerardimo says, Pokemon
1243920	1248960	Puzzle League sucked because it had no Yoshi, making a reference to the old school Tetris
1248960	1249960	Attack.
1249960	1253960	GS68 points out there's a Ms. Pac-Man machine at Miggle, Milpitas Golf Land, a very infamous
1253960	1256080	arcade here in California.
1256080	1259000	BlackBoy says, I think I need the Fuchsia DS Lite.
1259000	1262960	So, that's almost a flaming DS Lite right there.
1262960	1267840	Alright, well, that sounds like it's about it for our gaming weeks, so let's get into
1267840	1274920	some housekeeping real, real quick, and then we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.
1274920	1276280	Not a whole lot of housekeeping.
1276280	1281040	Next week is our fifth anniversary show, and I know, crazy, huh?
1281040	1286020	We're going to keep exactly what we're doing somewhat under wraps until the show comes
1286020	1290400	next week, basically because we still haven't figured it out completely, but all we can
1290400	1293880	say is that it'll definitely be very us, no matter what we end up doing.
1293880	1295960	It's definitely going to be very us.
1295960	1303680	Alright, also, we wanted to say a happy 100th episode to Bobby, because he had his 100th
1303680	1307240	episode tonight, so congrats to Bobby Blackwolf, our friend over at AllGames.com.
1307240	1311880	Speaking of AllGames.com, you can always hear the rebroadcast of our program over there.
1311880	1317720	Monday nights at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time, they replay our show.
1317720	1322280	It's A and B back to back, so sometimes you have to wait for part B on the podcast or
1322280	1324020	audio blog feed for a little while.
1324020	1327240	They replay it over there Monday nights and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific Standard
1327240	1328380	Time.
1328380	1330080	Let's get into some gaming news.
1330080	1334680	We obviously missed a week last week, so, Loki, tell us about what we missed.
1334680	1337280	Uh, well, some stuff.
1337280	1342760	I guess the Halo 3 beta ended, so everybody's sad because they have to wait for the Halo
1342760	1347000	3 actual game to come out, but, you know, hey, whatever.
1347000	1348000	They got a good turnout.
1348000	1351960	Apparently, Bungie was saying that they've clocked so many hours of Halo 3 that they
1351960	1355680	could have, if they were to create, I guess, one-on-one games using the same amount of
1355680	1361720	time in that beta, they would have 700 years worth of gameplay, so...
1361720	1363120	Go analysts!
1363120	1367160	Anyways, other rumors, I played it twice.
1367160	1370640	I played it once, I beat you.
1370640	1378520	So Parappa 3 rumored to be coming to the PS3, and this, of course, is coming from EGM.
1378520	1380760	No other information on that other than it's rumored.
1380760	1384240	I think that's kind of saying, like, duh.
1384240	1389720	Prince of Persia, the movie, it's going to be coming out July 10th, 2009.
1389720	1393820	Everybody's excited because it's going to be very Pirates of the Caribbean-like, so
1393820	1397520	hurrah.
1397520	1403620	Another updated, or upgraded graphic version of Metal Gear Solid 4's Tokyo Game Show
1403620	1410840	trailer has made it online with a little interesting bit that's missing towards the end.
1410840	1416360	Some people will notice that the PlayStation 3 logo is missing at the very end of the trailer.
1416360	1417360	Here we go again.
1417360	1418360	It's coming to the 360!
1418360	1419360	I swear to God, this game is coming to the 360!
1419360	1420360	This game is coming to the 360!
1420360	1424960	Why aren't you people listening to me?
1424960	1427440	Oh my God.
1427440	1429080	People are going crazy.
1429080	1431740	Anyways, shut up!
1431740	1435600	When they're ready to announce it on the 360, they will announce it, and yes, they probably
1435600	1439320	will, but keep your pants on in the meantime, God.
1439320	1447040	And next being announced, coming to film ultra-generic video game movie 4, in other words, City of
1447040	1454420	Heroes is going to be adapted to film and TV, because I don't know, it's just a parody
1454420	1457120	of all the other superhero things out there.
1457120	1461440	Sure, generic superhero movie, that'd be awesome.
1461440	1465360	Then Myst is coming to the DS, hurrah.
1465360	1469400	Lego MMO coming in 2008, that's awesome.
1469400	1474900	Tomb Raider anniversary edition, because you know, Tomb Raider is so fucking awesome, woohoo.
1474900	1479320	It's actually coming to the 360, possibly as download content, this is coming from ratings,
1479320	1484320	found on the ESRB's website, and people are thinking that's going to be download content,
1484320	1488120	possibly for Tomb Raider Legends, don't care.
1488120	1494680	And Pac-Man Championship Edition was released for the 360, and I guess it's the first actual
1494680	1499800	sequel to Pac-Man, although I do remember there's like Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Junior
1499800	1511520	Pac-Man, Pac-Man, Pac-Mania, Pac-Man Jr. though was admittedly harder because it had the scrolling
1511520	1513440	screen.
1513440	1518120	And it just kind of sucked, generally, it wasn't a Pac-Man or Junior Pac-Man.
1518120	1523240	What the fuck about Super Pac-Man, that game was completely different than Pac-Man, listen,
1523240	1528680	it's new, okay, sorry, this is coming from the people that know Pac-Man, the people that
1528680	1529680	made it.
1529680	1534240	Look, this is the first Pac-Man with raving, I'll give it that, this is the first Ravealicious
1534240	1536520	Pac-Man game, that's what it's got.
1536520	1541200	Guess what, you fucking bought Pac-Man again, you suck, you stupid bastard, and guess what,
1541200	1547240	Nintendo has another fucking Game Boy to throw at you too, dumbass, fuck, anyway, so yeah,
1547240	1553160	it came out, hooray, 10 bucks, I didn't buy it, but no, I did, I'm taking my shit, a lot
1553160	1556280	of people on my friends list did do it, a lot of people bought it.
1556280	1559520	Guess what, and then when the next Namco fucking collection comes out, there will be Pac-Man
1559520	1564720	in that too, and when the next console comes out, there will be another Pac-Man game, because
1564720	1566440	people buy Pac-Man.
1566440	1569040	You're sighing, Jamie, why are you sighing?
1569040	1570960	Getting ready to shoot myself in the head.
1570960	1574760	Why, from all the Pac-Man, Pac-Man overload, if you put the bullet in the right place,
1574760	1577960	you might have a little triangular shaped hole there, and then you would be actually
1577960	1578960	Ms. Pac-Man.
1578960	1579960	Where's Jigglypuff?
1579960	1584440	Uh, let's see, Banda in our chat room says, I want a Pac-Man MMORPG.
1584440	1585440	No!
1585440	1589400	What the hell would you do in a Pac-Man MMO?
1589400	1592400	Pac-Man eating shit.
1592400	1593400	Did you not play Pac-Man World?
1593400	1596240	No, it'd be like, it'd be like the Pac-Man family from the cartoon.
1596240	1599920	Oh yeah, and there was that side-scrolling Pac-Man game, what the fuck, isn't that a
1599920	1600920	sequel?
1600920	1602640	Remember, at Classic Gaming Expo, I bought that.
1602640	1603640	You did?
1603640	1605240	I bought it for the TurboGrafx.
1605240	1606240	You sucker.
1606240	1610040	But, it was the only copy that I have.
1610040	1612760	Oh, okay, well that makes it all of them.
1612760	1613760	Oh, well, okay.
1613760	1614760	It's Pac-Land.
1614760	1615760	It was Pac-Land.
1615760	1619160	I remember playing Pac-Land, I'm like, oh, Pac-Land, this is gonna be interesting, because
1619160	1620960	it's not Pac-Man, it's Pac-Land.
1620960	1623600	I played it, I'm like, wow, this sucks.
1623600	1627680	Stupid mame, making me play crappy games, because I don't know what they are, and then
1627680	1629440	you went back to Ms. World 96 Nude.
1629440	1633800	No, all you have to do, if ever you want the ultimate mame experience, you just play Blazing
1633800	1634800	Star.
1634800	1639480	All right, I have to introduce our special guest tonight, who came in a little bit late
1639480	1643880	there while Loki was doing his story, but this is your first time in the studio, right?
1643880	1647600	I think the last time I went here was in 2005 May.
1647600	1648920	You're old school.
1648920	1650640	Right after Phantom May of 2005.
1650640	1651640	Let's tell them who you are.
1651640	1655240	What's your name, what's your online name, where might we have seen you before?
1655240	1658960	Okay, my name is Jonas Casarino, or also known as Explicit.
1658960	1661960	I think some of you guys heard me a long time ago.
1661960	1662960	Old school.
1662960	1665200	Our F.U. of the Week god.
1665200	1670280	Oh god, that's right, he likes to give the F.U.s the week that go on all day.
1670280	1672000	But that's all right, we'll let you get to it.
1672000	1674440	What kind of stuff do you do out there in the community?
1674440	1678320	Right now, SacAnime has got me part of...
1678320	1679320	I'll be there.
1679320	1680320	Oh, you will be there?
1680320	1682880	I'll be one of the head people of the gaming area.
1682880	1684280	I'll be cosplaying.
1684280	1686540	Cool, as what?
1686540	1689200	Sexy Nojuku Iruka.
1689200	1691160	Sexy isn't it?
1691160	1696400	I know where people are going to know you from, Explicit, is your cosplay from Fanime
1696400	1699000	this year, which is actually when I told you.
1699000	1700000	That was the greatest ever.
1700000	1703080	Because when I ran into you, I said, you need to come back on the show.
1703080	1705680	Tell them what you cosplayed as, it was awesome.
1705680	1713240	Okay, for those who did not go to Fanime Con, I was the one who dressed up as the Weemote.
1713240	1717560	We saw you walking by when we were heading back to the hotel room, we were like, dude,
1717560	1719560	is that a Weemote?
1719560	1723000	I said to someone, I was like, that's explicit, remember him when he used to come on the show?
1723000	1724680	You weren't there, I was walking...
1724680	1727320	I was with somebody, it might have been Ramu or somebody, I was like, that's explicit.
1727320	1728320	Oh, was it you, Matt?
1728320	1729320	Maybe that's it.
1729320	1730320	Alright, that's what it was.
1730320	1734720	Alright, but anyway, so now you're back, and so we were able to exchange numbers and everything,
1734720	1738280	get you back here on the program to give some more FUs, so feel free to chime in throughout
1738280	1739280	the night.
1739280	1741280	What kind of games have you been playing recently?
1741280	1742280	Any Wii games?
1742280	1746480	Well, since I have a Wii, yep, WarioWare, I'd like to try to get someone to play drunk
1746480	1747800	WarioWare on that.
1747800	1750280	Mmm, there's an idea for the fifth anniversary.
1750280	1751280	Alright.
1751280	1756840	And let's, yeah, um, let's see, I've been playing Planet Puzzle League lately, since
1756840	1761000	I've been trying to get, trying to master all these puzzle games lately.
1761000	1762000	What do you think of it?
1762000	1767840	It was actually pretty difficult just to master itself, it's a lot harder than like Tetris
1767840	1770160	or Luminous in which...
1770160	1772480	I bought it, but I've only played it once, so.
1772480	1776040	Yeah, but I've just seen that insane video that someone sent me a while ago, it was like
1776040	1778040	33X combo.
1778040	1779040	Dang.
1779040	1780040	Yeah.
1780040	1781040	Is that on YouTube somewhere?
1781040	1782040	I might have to check that out.
1782040	1783040	Yeah, it's on YouTube somewhere.
1783040	1784040	Huh.
1784040	1785040	Have you played Puzzle Quest?
1785040	1786040	Because I was raving about that earlier in the show.
1786040	1787040	Puzzle Quest is great.
1787040	1788040	I have not played that yet.
1788040	1791420	It's like, if you like role-playing games, you like puzzle games, they made this game
1791420	1792420	for you.
1792420	1794720	Seriously, they put a little bow on it and said, here, here it is.
1794720	1795720	Is it for DS?
1795720	1796720	Just for you.
1796720	1800640	For DS, PSP, and supposedly Xbox Live Arcade, I remember us doing a story that it's coming
1800640	1805220	to Xbox Live Arcade, but seriously, just get the DS, or PSP, actually, I have a friend,
1805220	1807520	this is the PSP version, looks a lot better.
1807520	1811120	I haven't seen it myself yet, I'm content with the DS one, but, I don't know.
1811120	1812120	We'll see what happens.
1812120	1813120	Take your poison.
1813120	1816940	Alright, anyway, so explicit, ladies and gentlemen, is here, so feel free to chime in whenever
1816940	1817940	you like.
1817940	1821520	But, we need to get to this week's news, so, Loki, if you wouldn't mind starting us off
1821520	1823600	with a little piece of the news from this week.
1823600	1825720	Yes, a piece of the news.
1825720	1830600	And of course, you know, if you've been listening to All Games, you probably heard about it,
1830600	1836760	but Sony has officially announced the agency for PC and the PS3.
1836760	1841880	It's going to be a brand new spy-themed MMO, not exactly spy versus spy, but it's still
1841880	1846160	pretty awesome, and yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.
1846160	1848280	And I don't know, we don't know.
1848280	1849660	Is it, Loki?
1849660	1851880	Is it going to be cool?
1851880	1852880	How do you know?
1852880	1853880	How do I know?
1853880	1854880	Because the screenshots look cool.
1854880	1858280	I mean, you've got two people firing guns at a bunch of people with guns.
1858280	1860920	I mean, that's all you need is guns and people firing guns.
1860920	1861920	I mean, seriously.
1861920	1862920	No, no, no, no, no.
1862920	1865040	And he has a parachute.
1865040	1866040	Is there fire?
1866040	1867720	Yes or no?
1867720	1869240	There's gunfire, muzzle flash, I mean.
1869240	1870240	I don't know.
1870240	1873640	That little spot on the ground looks like it might be fire.
1873640	1878480	I'm sure it's got fire, but I don't know, it looks pretty cool.
1878480	1887360	As long as it's not like, you know, she spies or something like that.
1887360	1888360	You are so random.
1888360	1893040	No, wait, doesn't this hook up with the PC, like it's like Shadowrun or something?
1893040	1894040	I thought I heard something about that.
1894040	1895040	I think it's the hook up.
1895040	1897400	No, seriously, can't you play with the PC people?
1897400	1900480	Well, it's an MMO, so I would imagine so.
1900480	1905000	Is it across the two platforms, or is it that they're just separate entities?
1905000	1907200	I got the impression you could play across both platforms.
1907200	1908200	I believe it's cross platforms.
1908200	1909200	Like Shadowrun.
1909200	1910200	I mean, it should.
1910200	1915080	I mean, the PS3 is fucking supposed to be powerful enough to run this shit, so why couldn't
1915080	1917080	they do cross platform?
1917080	1918080	I would think it is.
1918080	1921760	It's not like live, you know, where it's their own self-contained network.
1921760	1924680	It's Sony, do whatever, yeah.
1924680	1929420	Okay, I was gone and I was a bad boy and didn't stay up too much on my gaming news, so my
1929420	1934920	question to you would be, based on what you've read about this, is this the ace in the hole
1934920	1940820	that Sony needed to really kind of get a lot of momentum in the next-gen wars that are
1940820	1941820	going on right now?
1941820	1946320	Nope, because this game will probably not be out this year, that would be my guess.
1946320	1948320	So it's something like, you know, here's something to wait for.
1948320	1954440	It's just like Killzone 2, ooh, Killzone 2 is coming next year, so I mean, great, that's
1954440	1957460	awesome that it's coming next year, but we're talking now.
1957460	1960880	That's just like saying, you know, back when the 360 launched, ooh, but the PlayStation
1960880	1962440	3 is coming out.
1962440	1968640	Well, goodie for them, but it's not out right now, so, you know, it's just like, you know,
1968640	1972960	I'm gonna, well I'm gonna bring my friends, they're gonna beat you up, so meh.
1972960	1977960	Um, going to the chat room and looking at the comments there, Bandit says, I'd rather
1977960	1980560	play a She-Ra video game other than that.
1980560	1982800	Dude, I bet a She-Ra game would be great.
1982800	1984600	Gosh, a She-Ra game would be pretty fucking badass.
1984600	1987420	It's like uber-barbarian chickly.
1987420	1990320	And hopefully the little wizard guy's hidden somewhere in it.
1990320	1993280	GS68 says, PlayStation 3, gimmicks, gimmicks, gimmicks.
1993280	1996680	And that was Madam Raz.
1996680	2002520	And RawSteelUT follows that right up by saying, not as gimmicky as the Wii, oh snap.
2002520	2006720	BlackDevilerX says, great, that'll give the PS3 another game.
2006720	2012160	And RawSteelUT's also rolling his eyes going, ew, cross-platform, ew.
2012160	2017780	I heard the cross-platform so far, you know, with Shadowrun's kind of not working.
2017780	2021880	I don't want to give the definitive review on the game because I have not played it.
2021880	2025980	I'm not going to attempt to review a game based on screenshots alone, but word on the
2025980	2030420	street around my blogs and things of that nature is that Shadowrun sucks.
2030420	2032480	And I, I don't know, I won't...
2032480	2036120	What do you expect when you turn like a really awesome role-playing game and turn it into
2036120	2037120	a multiplayer only...
2037120	2042160	I fucking hate multiplayer only, you know, games out there.
2042160	2043680	That is retarded.
2043680	2046760	I don't want to play multiplayer games all the time.
2046760	2048680	Sometimes I'm in the mood for it, sometimes I'm not.
2048680	2052600	Okay, Psycoon's making angry face in chat says, Shadowrun fucking rocks.
2052600	2053600	So maybe...
2053600	2057560	It rocks, but it would have rocked even more as a fucking RPG, like it should be because
2057560	2058560	it's a RPG.
2058560	2063160	That would be, you know, a game that you can do like from FASTA or something that would
2063160	2067480	be good, just multiplayer only would be MechWarrior or something like that.
2067480	2071480	How did we get from talking about PlayStation 3's Ace and the whole game to talking about
2071480	2072880	Shadowrun?
2072880	2074380	Because they're cross-platform games.
2074380	2077680	Do we talk about the 360 too much on this program, maybe on, oh yeah, they are both
2077680	2078680	cross-platform games.
2078680	2079680	It's because it's awesome.
2079680	2083480	Okay, well, if you want to talk about cross-platform games that suck, Marvel Trading Card Game
2083480	2086200	on PSP and cross-platform with the PC.
2086200	2087200	Okay.
2087200	2088200	Woo-wee.
2088200	2089200	Okay, fair enough.
2089200	2090200	I guess we can all agree on that.
2090200	2091200	There you go.
2091200	2092200	All right, help.
2092200	2093200	Save us from this debate, DarkSakura.
2093200	2094200	Silent Hill 5.
2094200	2095200	Ooh, yes.
2095200	2096200	You got my attention.
2096200	2102520	Might have a US developer, but it could happen, it could not happen, so we don't know.
2102520	2107200	They're like, it could happen, but it could not, so we don't know.
2107200	2108200	Again, rumor.
2108200	2109200	Can we do something else now?
2109200	2110560	I fucking hate stories like that.
2110560	2113200	No offense, Jamie, because I know you're just reading what is...
2113200	2114200	I didn't pick it out.
2114200	2115200	I know.
2115200	2116200	I know you're just reading what...
2116200	2117200	Someone picked this like they picked their nose.
2117200	2120000	I know you're just reading what all the video game blogs are reporting on this week, which
2120000	2124520	is fine, but this is not news.
2124520	2125520	This is not news.
2125520	2127520	La, la, la.
2127520	2129080	I could hear once.
2129080	2130080	Really?
2130080	2140200	I mean, we all know that Silent Hill 5 is coming out soon, but to hear that it might
2140200	2146120	have a developer that might be doing this with it, how is that news?
2146120	2147800	That's even better, is it may or may not.
2147800	2154040	Wow, thank you for covering all sides of possibilities right there, because there were only two.
2154040	2155040	It may or may not.
2155040	2156280	It's sorted us.
2156280	2163840	I mean, you can't have like, it's, you can't have 50% on that.
2163840	2167480	They're a US developer that's right on the border of Mexico or something like that.
2167480	2171680	They're built on the border, so half of them are Mexican, half of them are in the US, so
2171680	2173360	it's halfway true.
2173360	2176200	No, it's being done by the Hawaiian division.
2176200	2177200	Which closed.
2177200	2178200	No, it's not.
2178200	2180880	They all got sent out to sea, didn't you hear?
2180880	2183080	Well, no wonder why the game's not going to get finished.
2183080	2184080	Exactly.
2184080	2187080	It's like sent to Hawaii, some guy's like, what the fuck is this?
2187080	2191000	Pyramid Head went snorkeling, you'll just have to deal.
2191000	2192920	Silent Hill, Xtreme Beach Volleyball.
2192920	2199220	You know, if this is, dude, the nurses are pretty hot, actually.
2199220	2203180	You know, if this is what the news is going to be like this week, then seriously, Orange
2203180	2207520	Lounge Radio has been preempted this week for the Dead or Alive movie discussion.
2207520	2210440	Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.
2210440	2212760	How did I actually watch that?
2212760	2213760	See?
2213760	2214760	Street Fighter II movie.
2214760	2215760	Anyhow.
2215760	2219540	That movie was all about Kylie Minogue.
2219540	2221000	That movie killed Raul Julia.
2221000	2224680	It was his last movie, that's true.
2224680	2225680	It killed him.
2225680	2228000	He could have had- Not even the life support suit could bring
2228000	2229000	him back.
2229000	2235520	He could have had even more years left, and that movie is just like, ugh, ugh, ugh.
2235520	2236520	He didn't even go- That's so rude.
2236520	2237520	He didn't even go Psycho Crusher once.
2237520	2240600	Didn't he have an HBO movie, actually?
2240600	2241600	Like that didn't count.
2241600	2244640	That was a movie that was Clint Eastwood, wasn't it?
2244640	2249120	Yeah, I just bought The Addams Family on DVD right before I left for New York.
2249120	2251280	That's Raul Julia at his finest.
2251280	2252280	That's how I prefer to remember him.
2252280	2253580	The Addams Family is fucking awesome.
2253580	2255080	And Addams Family values.
2255080	2261080	Oh, and then SSJ-100 Matt comes up with the perfect witty retort that only our chat room
2261080	2262880	can come up with.
2262880	2266320	Pyramid Head snorkels and gets taken out by a stingray barb.
2266320	2268000	That's just lovely.
2268000	2269000	Too soon.
2269000	2270000	Too soon.
2270000	2271000	No, no, no.
2271000	2275400	Pyramid Head would probably just poke the thing with his big pointy head.
2275400	2276400	You know what?
2276400	2277400	Seriously, I don't have to work tomorrow.
2277400	2279360	I'm gonna go get some liquor, I think.
2279360	2280360	That's my help.
2280360	2281360	That's my help me through tonight's show.
2281360	2283360	That doesn't help me through tonight's show, Bob.
2283360	2284360	You want some?
2284360	2286360	I'm trying to know something very disappointing.
2286360	2291120	I went to go get some root beer, you know, the nice root beer, and it fucking wasn't
2291120	2292120	there.
2292120	2293120	Nice root beer.
2293120	2294120	No, not that.
2294120	2295120	That's diet shit.
2295120	2296120	Diet is never nice.
2296120	2298920	So, all they have is fucking vanilla cream.
2298920	2300120	I fucking hate cream soda.
2300120	2301120	I hate it.
2301120	2302120	Hate it.
2302120	2303120	Hate it.
2303120	2304120	Hate it.
2304120	2307760	Was there a video game show here once, or was it just me?
2307760	2308760	Root beer tapper.
2308760	2311680	See, it ties in.
2311680	2313840	I am not deviating from the show's plan.
2313840	2317120	I am talking about video games, or at least one step into video games.
2317120	2321000	Alright, I'm gonna read this story so I can go get some booze.
2321000	2322000	Here it is.
2322000	2323000	Let's see.
2323000	2328160	Oh, this is actually, this is real news, actually.
2328160	2333080	Sony finally got themselves an official blog.
2333080	2336080	Let's give Sony a round of applause.
2336080	2341120	Congratulations, Sony, you finally caught on, and you got yourselves a blog.
2341120	2343080	You finally figured out, hey, maybe that Major Nelson.
2343080	2346240	You know, he seems to stay in touch with the community pretty good.
2346240	2348640	Xbox 360 seems to know what they're doing with the community.
2348640	2349920	Nintendo, they have Reggie.
2349920	2352080	Very likable, very personable guy.
2352080	2354400	Maybe Ken Kudaragi, Crayon Eater.
2354400	2355920	So what can we do?
2355920	2357380	So they finally launched a blog.
2357380	2358560	Good job, Sony.
2358560	2363280	And you can read it for yourself, blog.us.playstation.com.
2363280	2364280	And look at this.
2364280	2368960	At least this one's not faking the B.A., like an independent blog, like, was it that all
2368960	2370840	I want for Christmas is a PSP shit?
2370840	2373040	Yeah, this is actually fairly well done.
2373040	2376240	I mean, this is really what I think folks have been asking for.
2376240	2379040	There's some articles here, they're pretty honest.
2379040	2385000	This guy who is the U.S. producer for MotorStorm is talking about the patch and how the 1.2
2385000	2388320	is going to have this time attack mode, and then talking about how, like, there's a bug
2388320	2389320	in the game.
2389320	2393760	There was another post that's talking about the PS3 firmware update 1.81.
2393760	2398600	And they kind of have, like, a buffet of people, so to speak, writing for it.
2398600	2400380	And it's actually not bad.
2400380	2402040	So good job, Sony.
2402040	2406040	They're a little late in getting here, but, you know, I guess it was worth waiting for,
2406040	2407240	so fair enough.
2407240	2408240	Better late than never.
2408240	2409240	I guess.
2409240	2410240	That's very true.
2410240	2416120	Well, one thing that's better late than never, well, I guess it's not good for Sony, but
2416120	2422760	apparently people have already begun cracking the PlayStation firmwares.
2422760	2428240	And this is probably no thanks to the fact that the PlayStation 3 software development
2428240	2431440	kit got leaked a couple weeks ago out on the internet.
2431440	2433840	So yeah, that only helps things along.
2433840	2442160	But they've started with actually allowing, apparently versions 1.1 and 1.11 of the PS3
2442160	2449880	firmwares can now access, I guess, burnt game ISOs where you can, it'll recognize burnt
2449880	2451960	games, but it won't play them yet.
2451960	2458240	So I guess that's the first step in getting backwards compatibility with some burnt games
2458240	2465400	or possibly, I don't know, piracy, lots of pirated games, or homebrew.
2465400	2471560	But right now, you know, nothing's coming of it, but, you know, they're working on it.
2471560	2475720	But Sony has this to say about it.
2475720	2482680	They don't like the fact that people want to put homebrew and pirate things on the PS3,
2482680	2487600	so they have basically threatened people and said, unfortunately hackers will try to exploit
2487600	2490240	any hardware system software.
2490240	2495680	The best we can do as a company is to make our security that much stronger and aggressively
2495680	2500760	pursue legal action against anyone caught trying to use an exploit in a legal manner.
2500760	2505800	Naturally, any use of an exploit on the system software does void the warranty on your PlayStation
2505800	2511640	3 system, which could be a costly mistake to see if you can run an old Sega CD game
2511640	2512640	on it.
2512640	2516440	I don't think anyone's going to try to run an old Sega CD game, ever.
2516440	2519880	I would, but then again, I have old Sega CD games.
2519880	2524480	But you know, and they claim that they're serious, which means that they're in serious
2524480	2525480	trouble because...
2525480	2528240	They're not going to be able to do crap!
2528240	2533320	If the PS3 is so easy to crack this long, how many fucking updates have there been to
2533320	2534880	the damn firmware?
2534880	2539300	I mean, it's only a matter of time before they crack it, so.
2539300	2543880	If you know you're not interested in going online and stuff, I would recommend keeping
2543880	2548960	your firmware as low as possible, if you're interested in that piracy stuff.
2548960	2552560	As far as homebrew, though, I mean, hello, you can install Linux on it.
2552560	2558480	I mean, if you want to play old SNES games, you can fucking put it on Yellow Dog Linux,
2558480	2561480	so who cares?
2561480	2562480	Yay.
2562480	2565480	Well, I have better news than that.
2565480	2569040	This is happy news because I love the 80s.
2569040	2573960	Guitar Hero Encore has more tracks listed, which is, like, super happy.
2573960	2579000	So we have Hold On Loosely, that was, well, all of these, but one that I'm going to name
2579000	2584040	was a cover, so the one that's not a cover is The Warrior by Scandal.
2584040	2589520	Now the covers are Hold On Loosely from 38 Special, No One Like You by The Scorpions,
2589520	2594120	Only Aladdin, Oingo Boingo, it's a cool song, Radar Love by White Lion, Ballroom Blitz by
2594120	2596680	Crocus, a great name.
2596680	2597840	Dude, Ballroom Blitz is awesome.
2597840	2600480	I know, I like this song, I just always laugh at the band's name.
2600480	2604000	Well, Like About You by The Romantics, and Wrath of Child by Iron Maiden, because Iron
2604000	2606120	Maiden's fucking awesome.
2606120	2613600	And others on the list, 18 in Life, Bathroom Wall, Lonely is the Night, Nothing But a Good
2613600	2618000	Time, dude, Poison, Play With Me, Shaken, dude, I love Eddie, but it's like my favorite
2618000	2619960	Eddie Munny song ever.
2619960	2626040	Synchronicity 2, I Want to Rock, I Ran, of course, The Block of Seagulls, it's the actual
2626040	2634240	song too, so is the Twisted Sister one, Round and Round, I Want Candy, Metal Health, Holy
2634240	2638160	Diver, sorry, and Heat of the Moment.
2638160	2640240	Are you excited about Guitar Heroes Rock Series?
2640240	2641240	Hell yeah!
2641240	2643980	I love my 80s rock.
2643980	2647280	So I went to go make some liquor, which I don't have a lot to pick from because I didn't
2647280	2649320	stock up before tonight's show.
2649320	2652320	I mixed Malibu rum and root beer, how do you think that's going to turn out?
2652320	2653320	Give me.
2653320	2654320	Wait, I haven't tried it yet.
2654320	2655320	You want to try it first?
2655320	2656320	Alright, try that.
2656320	2661400	Don't spill it on your laptop, for God's sake.
2661400	2664080	Some bizarre shit that tastes like Dr. Pepper, which is nasty.
2664080	2665080	Really?
2665080	2667400	Everything tastes like Dr. Pepper when you mix it with alcohol.
2667400	2670880	Let me try this.
2670880	2673400	It kind of does taste like Dr. Pepper, it's not too bad.
2673400	2676320	Well, I hate Dr. Pepper, so I'm finishing off my root beer.
2676320	2679320	Dr. Pepper says that was a combination of everything.
2679320	2681480	You want to know what's still in my fridge, by the way, Rob?
2681480	2684240	The bottle of pineapple Malibu from Fauna Mae.
2684240	2685240	Delicious.
2685240	2687560	I think DevilerX wants to know, Sky, what kind of root beer?
2687560	2688560	It's Diet IBC.
2688560	2689560	Ew.
2689560	2690560	There we go.
2690560	2694280	Alright, so I mixed it with Malibu, because that's all I had.
2694280	2697520	I had that and citrus vodka, and I knew that would be really bad.
2697520	2699520	You should mix with vodka and the Malibu.
2699520	2700520	We'll see, we'll see.
2700520	2702160	Drink that like a shot.
2702160	2703920	Can I do a video game story, please?
2703920	2704920	No.
2704920	2705920	Okay.
2705920	2706920	Alright.
2706920	2711160	Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the Playstation 3, not that you may have heard that somewhere
2711160	2716680	before, where it was soon after retracted, but we can officially, with permission, tell
2716680	2722340	you now that Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the Playstation 3 with a GunCon controller,
2722340	2729700	and of course, Famitsu, they were the first to break this news about Time Crisis 4 coming
2729700	2730920	to the Playstation 3.
2730920	2733560	You hadn't heard it anywhere before then.
2733560	2737800	The Playstation 3 version will have an arcade mode, and it's just going to be just like
2737800	2741440	the arcade game, which is pretty awesome.
2741440	2744420	So if you like Time Crisis, you're going to be really excited about this game, I'm sure.
2744420	2748240	There is a GunCon controller that's coming out with this, which is kind of ugly.
2748240	2750520	It's orange, and kind of looks like the Zapper.
2750520	2752760	Not as ugly as the dude holding it, dude.
2752760	2753760	That guy is fugly.
2753760	2754760	That's cool, though.
2754760	2759400	I was reading that they're going to have first person shooter portions of the game.
2759400	2761880	That's why the GunCon's so weird looking.
2761880	2763020	That's kind of cool, though.
2763020	2765640	And apparently, they're going to have, it functions like the Wii.
2765640	2768680	You put these things on the left and right side of your TV, kind of like how on the Wii
2768680	2774360	you have the LED bar, and then there's a camera inside the actual gun, and that determines
2774360	2776280	where the markers are at.
2776280	2781080	So that means, that way you can use the GunCon, whether you have an LCD, a plasma, whatever.
2781080	2783920	It'll work on any type of TV, which is good news.
2783920	2788440	What's kind of neat, though, and I mean, how many GunCon games are out there?
2788440	2789780	I mean, really not that many.
2789780	2795600	I think that this would be awesome for first person shooters, because you've got, basically,
2795600	2800280	on the front grip of the gun, you have kind of the second half of a Playstation controller.
2800280	2804680	You've got your own analog stick and two shoulder buttons, and then on the back of the gun there's
2804680	2807280	another analog stick right by the trigger.
2807280	2815560	So in a sense, this would be the perfect solution for, you know, gun games or first person shooters.
2815560	2819880	That way you can control your looking camera with, you know, the right analog stick, control
2819880	2824400	your movement with the left analog stick, and then you can free aim with the gun.
2824400	2829240	I mean, it's fucking awesome, except they will never use it like that and it will suck,
2829240	2830240	so dammit.
2830240	2831240	Frustration.
2831240	2838560	Camara in chat says, it's upgraded Duck Hunt.
2838560	2839560	Pretty much.
2839560	2840560	Pretty much.
2840560	2841560	I guess so.
2841560	2842560	Sure.
2842560	2843560	Sure, you got it.
2843560	2844560	Upgraded Duck Hunt.
2844560	2845560	Duck Hunt 2 coming out.
2845560	2846560	Funny story.
2846560	2849600	I'm not sure about Duck Hunt, but I heard that some old NES Zapper games, you could
2849600	2855560	actually get perfect scores by aiming the light gun at a light and just keep shooting
2855560	2856560	at the light.
2856560	2858880	Or put a magnifying glass in front of a light gun.
2858880	2861640	That's the other trick.
2861640	2862640	Works like a charm.
2862640	2864620	Anyhow, so there it is.
2864620	2868360	GunCon Time Crisis 3 coming to the Playstation 3 very soon.
2868360	2869360	Yay.
2869360	2870360	Awesome.
2870360	2871520	And another thing that was announced for Playstation 3.
2871520	2872880	Wake me up when they have point blank.
2872880	2873880	That's all I have to say.
2873880	2874880	Sorry.
2874880	2875880	That would be awesome.
2875880	2880500	And for the 360, Soul Calibur IV.
2880500	2883760	Because we knew that Soul Calibur Legends couldn't be possibly the only game coming
2883760	2884760	out.
2884760	2891400	Soul Calibur IV will be coming out, they claim, that's going to be 60 frames per second.
2891400	2895280	I read somewhere 90 frames per second, which would be stupid.
2895280	2899680	But not that you would be able to see that.
2899680	2904080	And then also that it's going to possibly be 1080p.
2904080	2910220	The other thing, apparently everybody's been talking about certain characters getting boob
2910220	2911720	upgrades in the game.
2911720	2913880	It's just a fucking game, folks.
2913880	2919000	But the teaser video that they had for it didn't really reveal too much because it was
2919000	2920960	just still shots.
2920960	2927000	Well, I'm just glad, you know, I know most games we joke about are obvious that they're
2927000	2932080	coming like Silent Hill 5, Final Fantasy XIV someday, you know, and all these other series.
2932080	2936680	I wasn't 100% for sure that there was going to be another Soul Calibur game, because I
2936680	2940040	could have sworn they said with this last one, that's it, kids.
2940040	2943840	And then the fact that, you know, the arcade release came later.
2943840	2949400	There was a comment on Sony's website saying that Soul Calibur III was exclusive for PS2
2949400	2952080	and any future Soul Calibur games.
2952080	2957400	I was wondering, what happened with the decision with Soul Calibur IV being multi-console now?
2957400	2962500	Well, you see what happened is that Microsoft actually sold consoles, so that's why the
2962500	2964760	decision was made to go multi-platform, I guess.
2964760	2967480	It could be the 4 million console leave that they have.
2967480	2970920	Or there's this whole rumor thing, I mean, because Sony or the fanboys are writing the
2970920	2974460	hate mail right now, but also look at this, is that Namco, and you know, you'll see this
2974460	2979200	throughout some other stories you may hear tonight or may not, is that Namco and Microsoft
2979200	2982200	are starting to be in bed together, you might notice.
2982200	2985640	I mean, seriously, if you look at some of the decisions they've made recently and some
2985640	2989600	of the things, I mean, not that they've abandoned PlayStation 3, but look at like, you know,
2989600	2995680	Ace Combat and some of these other things, you know, Namco's kind of, you know, getting
2995680	2998680	in bed with my, they're going out to dinner, they're giving each other, you know, sensual
2998680	3002480	massages, they're, you know, they're getting to know each other a little bit here, getting
3002480	3003480	comfy.
3003480	3005480	Fucking popping out this goddamn Pac-Man sequel, babies.
3005480	3007480	There you go.
3007480	3009520	The true sequel.
3009520	3010520	True sequel.
3010520	3013680	Yeah, then the next fucking true sequel game.
3013680	3016080	I love Soul Calibur, it's one of my favorite fighting game projects.
3016080	3019040	I love Rod Calibur.
3019040	3020280	With the Dreamcast thing?
3020280	3022360	With the Dreamcast fishing rod, Rod Calibur.
3022360	3024480	You just told that story like last time we had a show.
3024480	3029400	I know, but every time I think of Soul Calibur, I think of Rod Calibur and how great it is.
3029400	3030400	Fair enough.
3030400	3032720	We need a new fishing controller for more Rod Calibur fun.
3032720	3035120	I think about Ivy and how great she is.
3035120	3041820	I think about trying to play Soul Calibur on the DDR pad on Dreamcast, and the only
3041820	3045720	analog button was like the Konami logo.
3045720	3048400	You're tapping your fingers like you want to say something, Loki.
3048400	3050240	I'm not tapping my fingers because I want to say anything.
3050240	3052120	He has a nervous twitch.
3052120	3054120	It's because I'm only through Pepsi.
3054120	3056560	You want to go get some Malibu?
3056560	3057560	No, no, I'm good.
3057560	3061360	Oh, actually, I was reminded that I cracked open alcohol in the studio without giving
3061360	3066360	the OLR alcohol disclaimer, because we may have some young'uns who listen, and so just
3066360	3068840	so you know, whenever we drink on the program, we do it responsibly.
3068840	3071960	I live here, so I can drink because I'm not going to drive.
3071960	3074560	That's why Jamie and Matt can't drink tonight, because they didn't make other arrangements,
3074560	3076440	because they didn't know I was going to crack open the liquor.
3076440	3078360	Matt, you have nasty alcohol here.
3078360	3080760	And don't drink by yourself.
3080760	3082920	And don't drink lots of water.
3082920	3085760	Yes, and please don't drink lots of water and not pee.
3085760	3088920	And don't sit on the ground drinking nothing but vodka and orange juice.
3088920	3089920	All right, there.
3089920	3091280	There's your disclaimer.
3091280	3092280	Back to news.
3092280	3093280	Hey, I have...
3093280	3094280	Anything else on Soul Calibur?
3094280	3095280	Sorry.
3095280	3096280	Oh, yes.
3096280	3097280	Explicit.
3097280	3099000	Wait, wait, the raw Calibur?
3099000	3100000	That's...
3100000	3102000	I mean, the DDR pad.
3102000	3103000	Soul Calibur.
3103000	3104000	That's almost as best...
3104000	3105000	It doesn't work.
3105000	3108280	That's almost as bizarre as someone trying to perform Shoryuken on a Street Fighter with
3108280	3109280	the DDR pad.
3109280	3110280	Seen it happen.
3110280	3111280	Seen it done.
3111280	3112280	Shoryuken!
3112280	3118600	It actually is much easier to do the... to do that with the DDR pad.
3118600	3121200	I'm going to try some of those Xbox Live Arcade games I didn't like.
3121200	3125160	Like, I'm going to try Novadrome with the DDR pad and see if it's more fun.
3125160	3126160	No.
3126160	3127160	Maybe.
3127160	3130680	Maybe if I drink a few more, it'll be fine.
3130680	3132040	All right.
3132040	3134040	No, what...
3134040	3139520	I have an excellent idea for some of these crappy games out there, and it's an excellent
3139520	3140520	idea for...
3140520	3141520	A gun?
3141520	3142520	No.
3142520	3143520	Skeet shooting?
3143520	3146200	For the ultimate endurance test.
3146200	3147680	Let me put it that way.
3147680	3148680	Okay.
3148680	3150880	DJ Genise in chat says, all video games are shit.
3150880	3153160	Play with a jump rope.
3153160	3154880	You might be listening to the wrong show, buddy.
3154880	3157320	I don't know what to tell you.
3157320	3161760	Well, you know, Microsoft would say jump in, so...
3161760	3162760	Hitstun says you can kind of...
3162760	3163760	Can I read my story, please?
3163760	3164760	Yeah, all right.
3164760	3165760	Wait, one more check on it.
3165760	3168600	Hitstun says you can kind of play Street Fighter on a 2DX controller.
3168600	3171600	You just can't... you just can't go left.
3171600	3172600	Oh, well...
3172600	3175160	So just be player one?
3175160	3180720	I guess so, and hope that player two never thinks to jump over you or else you're fucked.
3180720	3182880	I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.
3182880	3189680	Anyway, for those who are keeping up with the PS1 games that were to be coming out on
3189680	3196120	the PSN, PlayStation Store, or whatever the hell they're calling it, we have Crash Bandicoot,
3196120	3202840	Wipeout, Medieval, Jumping Flash, and Syphon Filter that will be available on, looks like
3202840	3203840	next Friday.
3203840	3206560	Actually, no, is it this Friday?
3206560	3207800	No, take that back.
3207800	3209760	Next Friday, sorry.
3209760	3216280	It will be available for PS3 and PSP, but you can only buy them from the PS3 store.
3216280	3217520	I'm guessing that's for the UK.
3217520	3218520	For the UK, yes.
3218520	3219520	I'm sorry.
3219520	3220520	My apologies.
3220520	3222560	Also going to be available is on 22nd June.
3222560	3226920	There will be Calling All Cars and Super Stardust HD on June 29th.
3226920	3230880	I heard Calling All Cars sucks.
3230880	3231880	Take that, Dave Jeff.
3231880	3235960	Well, I don't like to say that anything sucks until I've actually either seen it in play
3235960	3237960	or have played it myself.
3237960	3241160	No, I think I'm going to pass judgment before I play it.
3241160	3244720	I know, I actually do that a lot, actually.
3244720	3247320	Sometimes I'm wrong.
3247320	3248440	I wrote off Halo.
3248440	3250320	I was like, I will never like that game.
3250320	3253040	I haven't liked a first-person shooter since Quake.
3253040	3254040	Halo's going to suck.
3254040	3258520	And then I actually played it at, get this, my friend's wedding reception.
3258520	3263920	They had a Halo-themed wedding reception, and they had TVs all land together and played
3263920	3264920	Halo.
3264920	3267360	They actually had a cake with Master Chief on it, and that was the first time I ever
3267360	3268880	played Halo, and I had a blast.
3268880	3275000	So you can't always judge by looking, but some of the time you can.
3275000	3276000	Some of the time you really can.
3276000	3277960	I already know why I can't play Halo.
3277960	3278960	Because of the motion sickness thing.
3278960	3279960	Yep.
3279960	3280960	Sorry to hear it.
3280960	3281960	All right.
3281960	3287200	Well, let's talk about some upcoming games that you may or may not be playing in the
3287200	3288200	near future.
3288200	3291640	We like to travel the world when we do these releases, so let's take a look at the Japanese
3291640	3297200	release dates and listen to me horribly mispronounce some game name titles, shall we?
3297200	3303120	Coming out on the 21st on the Xbox 360, Saints Row finally in Japan, Shadowrun also coming
3303120	3309120	out in Japan, and some other games coming to the Asian region, such as Vampire Rain.
3309120	3314600	Also I want to point out Def Jam Icon also comes out from EA on the Xbox 360, all on
3314600	3316320	June 21st.
3316320	3323200	Also coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 21st is Hajime no Ippo Revolution, which looks
3323200	3326320	to be another type of anime-based video game.
3326320	3327320	Oh no, it's a sports title.
3327320	3328320	It's a boxing title.
3328320	3329320	Yeah.
3329320	3330320	That's actually what it is.
3330320	3331320	First something.
3331320	3332320	Kind of cool.
3332320	3335320	I don't remember what it's called.
3335320	3337080	It's an anime series that's over here too.
3337080	3338080	Gotcha.
3338080	3342000	So I'm sure somebody in chat knows, and you might be wondering why isn't it Punch Out?
3342000	3346160	Because this is made by AQ Interactive, not a Nintendo in-house production.
3346160	3351000	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, a port of Def Jam Icon over there, as well as Monster
3351000	3355140	Kingdom coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on the 21st.
3355140	3359200	If you prefer to keep it with the current systems on the PlayStation 2, there's still
3359200	3361120	quite a few games coming out.
3361120	3365640	The Art of Fighting Collection moves into the best hits, and that comes out in Japan
3365640	3367200	on the 21st.
3367200	3370760	Also coming out, this is my favorite game name of the week.
3370760	3375000	It's Fun Super Combo.
3375000	3380540	That's F-U-U-U-N Super Combo.
3380540	3385000	This actually just looks like a Neo Geo compilation of some of the games there that SNK put out
3385000	3386000	previously.
3386000	3387000	I bet they're pretty fun.
3387000	3388000	I bet they are fun.
3388000	3392560	Dude, it will be fun unless Psycho Soldier is one of them.
3392560	3395680	Lots and lots of SNK loving this week in Japan, by the way.
3395680	3397880	There's a King of Fighters thing coming out too.
3397880	3399560	Are any of them new?
3399560	3403200	If you're on the DS, I've got news for you.
3403200	3405480	This could be the game of the year right here.
3405480	3412400	Hello Kitty no Gattuchi Collection, Koi no Doki Doki Trouble is coming out.
3412400	3417680	And the box is beautifully pink with Hello Kitty wearing a bunny suit.
3417680	3418680	I think she's confused.
3418680	3421920	No, this is made by Rocket Company, not SNK.
3421920	3424280	That's on the Nintendo DS.
3424280	3428700	I'm checking to see real quick if there's anything on the PSP, looking at my list here.
3428700	3432400	See if there's anything on the PSP coming to Japan.
3432400	3437060	Well, the Katamari Damacy game that was on the PSP moves into best hits, so you can get
3437060	3441640	that a little cheaper over in Japan, otherwise not a lot of new stuff.
3441640	3444840	Loco Roco also moves into best hits.
3444840	3445840	Check it out.
3445840	3449160	What about the Capcom vs SNK card fighting game?
3449160	3450160	What's that?
3450160	3455280	What about the Capcom vs SNK fighting card game that came out a while ago?
3455280	3459740	It came out here, but it got recalled because it was fucked up, but they're fixing it for
3459740	3461440	Europe where I don't believe it's been released.
3461440	3465680	But remember the cool thing about the DS is they're not region locked, so you can buy,
3465680	3468640	if you really want this game, you can import Europe's version or something and it'll be
3468640	3472720	English and not fucked up, so something to think about.
3472720	3477080	Alright, let's get to some more release dates, shall we?
3477080	3483040	Alright, this week there's actually a few things coming out in the US, starting off
3483040	3484520	with some weird games.
3484520	3488240	PlayStation 2, The Adventures of Darwin.
3488240	3489960	This is a little interesting.
3489960	3494140	You basically, it's almost like a portion of Spore.
3494140	3499840	You start off with a civilization that's pretty retarded and caveman-like, and you teach them
3499840	3503560	to be more civilized.
3503560	3508640	Then the Hitman trilogy is coming out, including the first three games of the Hitman series,
3508640	3511040	so that's pretty interesting.
3511040	3517640	On Xbox 360, we have Dirt coming out, which is an awesome off-road racing game, so definitely
3517640	3519640	check that out.
3519640	3526960	PS3, PQ2, remember those old IQ games, this one should be pretty cool.
3526960	3532920	Hot Brain is going to be coming out on the PSP, another brain-training sim.
3532920	3535960	PuzzleScape, another puzzle game.
3535960	3540580	Dungeon Maker, Hunting Ground, a very interesting role-playing game with a little bit of sim
3540580	3544640	aspects in there, that's going to be coming out as well.
3544640	3548840	On PlayStation 3, you got a big fat nothing.
3548840	3552280	Rainbow Six Vegas was going to be coming out this week, but once again, it's been delayed
3552280	3555520	yet another week.
3555520	3560480	The Wii, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is going to be making its way out, so that's going
3560480	3562120	to be pretty cool.
3562120	3567040	And the DS, Time Ace, which is that Konami game that we played that's, I guess, sequel
3567040	3572720	to Time Pilot, I was the only one that kind of pointed that out, but Zendoku is going
3572720	3575480	to be coming out, yet another Sudoku game.
3575480	3579120	SimCity DS, Rob, possibly a game that you might want to pick up?
3579120	3580120	Maybe, maybe.
3580120	3583360	I have so many games, I still have World of Warcraft to worry about on top of all the
3583360	3587480	other new crap I've got, so, I don't know, too many games, too many games, it's not even
3587480	3588480	Christmas yet.
3588480	3593400	The Transformers game is coming out a little bit early for the DS, you have both the Autobots
3593400	3596740	and Decepticons games going to be heading your way.
3596740	3599680	So there is more than meets the eye to these games.
3599680	3606800	And then finally, NPC, Dirt is also coming out, as well as the Hitman trilogy.
3606800	3613760	They're actually putting out, yet again, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, and The Sims Pet Stories
3613760	3615480	will be making its way out.
3615480	3617480	Goody, goody.
3617480	3621340	You know, I went to the new Fry's Electronics they built out in Roseville, which is all,
3621340	3622340	you know, train things out there.
3622340	3623340	Very trainalicious.
3623340	3625000	It's cute, it's cute, it's a cute store.
3625000	3629040	You know, the Sacramento fries is unlike any other fries because it doesn't have a theme,
3629040	3631080	but all the other fries around the world have themes.
3631080	3635320	But anyway, the point is, I was looking at computer games just randomly, because I was
3635320	3638880	thinking about maybe buying a new computer game, I was actually, I don't know why, I
3638880	3643320	was tempted for like half a second to get the Lord of the Rings MMO, even though I know,
3643320	3647200	it's like, I'm like, oh, I kind of want to try it for no good reason.
3647200	3648200	But I didn't get it.
3648200	3653680	But I was looking at computer games, not even kidding, one entire shelf, almost like two
3653680	3657240	actually, dedicated to The Sims and all their spinoff series.
3657240	3661840	I mean, which is, I mean, it is one of the, what, the best selling game ever.
3661840	3664480	How many shelves are dedicated to the Tycoon series?
3664480	3666640	I don't even want to know.
3666640	3669680	Well, how about some different release dates?
3669680	3671000	How about it?
3671000	3675280	For our friends in the UK, coming out on the 22nd, we have Calling All Cars, like I said
3675280	3683840	earlier, we have Flat Out Ultimate Carnage, Hot Pixel, Hour of Victory, Kirby Mouse Attack,
3683840	3690580	Mario Party 8, Metroid Prime Pinball, Monster Madness, Pac-Man Rally, Sega Presents Touch
3690580	3694560	Darts, and Cosmic Family.
3694560	3697400	Metroid Prime Pinball just now?
3697400	3698920	You poor kids over in the UK.
3698920	3702920	I mean, it's not that that game was like that great, but seriously, that game came out here,
3702920	3703920	what, like six months ago?
3703920	3704920	Fuck that shit.
3704920	3706640	They get Flat Out before I do.
3706640	3711880	I mean, I want Flat Out for the 360 so I can launch my driver through the window and into
3711880	3712880	things.
3712880	3716160	It's one game early and, you know, they're bastards.
3716160	3719320	Hey, they have Tomb Raider early, whatever, okay.
3719320	3720320	Yay.
3720320	3723240	Are you excited about Tomb Raider?
3723240	3729320	That's what I thought.
3729320	3731600	Let's talk about gaming on the Mac, shall we?
3731600	3736960	Because we don't always get to talk about this and Loki usually has a field day with
3736960	3742960	this topic, but, you know, there was a pretty big keynote done, sorry, I've been drinking.
3742960	3747320	There's been a keynote done by Steve Jobs, did this, the Worldwide Developers Conference
3747320	3753520	did a keynote and he talked about at the keynote that there are going to be, excuse me, I was
3753520	3754520	very professional, sorry.
3754520	3755520	Yay.
3755520	3758600	I don't get a sneeze, but there's going to be coughing all over the Macintosh computers.
3758600	3760960	No, here's what's really going on.
3760960	3765640	They announced at the conference that Apple is going to be teaming up with EA and Electronic
3765640	3771240	Arts is actually going to be putting out some of their games onto the Macs.
3771240	3777360	Command and Conquer 3, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter, and Madden and Tiger Woods 08.
3777360	3780280	So there you go, gaming on the Mac.
3780280	3781920	About fucking time.
3781920	3786280	Well, I think they've had some games before this, but, you know, EA is definitely stepping
3786280	3789680	it up a notch on the Macintosh, so that's pretty cool.
3789680	3795840	Another thing that's being shown off as well is id's Tech 5 engine, it's going to be their
3795840	3798420	fifth generation 3D engine.
3798420	3805020	You might remember them from such games as Quake 4, Doom 3, and all those other fun things.
3805020	3812960	Of course, they said that their new engine will also be able to run on Mac OS X.
3812960	3813960	So that's good.
3813960	3819000	So you're actually going to get some pretty decent games on the Mac, finally.
3819000	3825880	And it's also, it says, not being built with Microsoft's DirectX 10, which makes sense
3825880	3829280	because not everyone wants to have Vista either.
3829280	3831400	So that's pretty cool.
3831400	3836000	And I guess this engine will also be able to run natively on the 360 and Playstation
3836000	3837000	3.
3837000	3840120	So the tech demo that they showed looked pretty cool, kind of reminded me of Motorstorm a
3840120	3844400	bit, but very detailed, so I'm looking forward to some new games.
3844400	3847740	Could this be a new Unreal engine?
3847740	3852040	You know how that's the engine that everybody is licensing for their games?
3852040	3855880	Could this be like the next great engine that everybody wants to license?
3855880	3856880	Possibly.
3856880	3861160	I mean, Doom 3, the Doom 3 engine was, I mean, Quake 4 engine had a lot of things going for
3861160	3862160	it.
3862160	3867180	Well, actually Quake 4 I think ran on the Doom 3 engine, so yeah, it could be the next
3867180	3868180	big engine.
3868180	3872280	I mean, if it does things that Unreal can't, personally, I think Crysis is going to be
3872280	3873780	fucking awesome.
3873780	3878620	That engine is going to be nuts as far as the amount of detail that's in it, so they
3878620	3880720	have a real high bar to meet.
3880720	3883240	Alright, well I guess we shall see.
3883240	3887720	But I'm assuming, Loki, this doesn't exactly make you want to run out and buy a Mac.
3887720	3888720	Why?
3888720	3889720	My PC can run games just fine.
3889720	3890720	I had a feeling.
3890720	3891720	Although it's a bit old.
3891720	3893360	I need a new one.
3893360	3895480	A new PC!
3895480	3898120	PC, personal computer.
3898120	3899880	I do need to get a Mac upgrade at some point.
3899880	3902920	I want one of those pretty new Macs, the big screen laptop.
3902920	3903920	Anyway.
3903920	3904920	Sorry.
3904920	3912760	Well, it looks like Capcom is going to start releasing titles through Steam.
3912760	3919080	They're going to be putting out PC versions of Lost Planet, Onimusha 3, Devil May Cry
3919080	3923680	3, Special Edition, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.
3923680	3927240	Can I add for matching service to that, just because I think it's funny?
3927240	3928280	Sure.
3928280	3933120	But I did not know that the Puzzle Fighter game was coming to the computers.
3933120	3935960	Or did I just miss that in the initial announcement?
3935960	3936960	I guess so.
3936960	3941520	Well, it says here that Capcom PC releases are going to be made available through Steam,
3941520	3942520	so.
3942520	3943520	Apparently.
3943520	3944520	Well, there you go.
3944520	3945520	Well, that's pretty cool.
3945520	3949480	And I might add that their fucking Street Fighter 2 HD game looks fucking awesome.
3949480	3955560	And I think that they've set the bar pretty high for any new 2D fighting games coming
3955560	3956560	out.
3956560	3959120	I'm not going to see Guilty Gear in that much detail.
3959120	3963780	It does look pretty hot, but it's going to do the same thing that Pac-Man CE did to Pac-Man
3963780	3968840	on Xbox Live Arcade, is it's going to piss you off that you bought the first one.
3968840	3973480	When this Street Fighter 2 HD version comes out, it's an arcade release, right?
3973480	3974480	Uh, yeah.
3974480	3975480	Yeah.
3975480	3977800	It's going to make you mad that you ever bought the Championship Edition release that came
3977800	3979480	out last year.
3979480	3980480	So.
3980480	3983080	I have every other version, why not?
3983080	3984080	I guess so.
3984080	3985080	There you have it.
3985080	3991280	Well, if you are a computer gamer, then you certainly know the series Monkey Island.
3991280	3993480	You remember this series of games, Monkey Island?
3993480	3994480	It's about pirates.
3994480	3995480	Hell yeah.
3995480	3996480	Huh?
3996480	3997480	Oh, hell yeah.
3997480	3998480	Well, hell yeah.
3998480	3999480	Well, guess what?
3999480	4004640	Apparently, going around LucasArts is rumblings of a fifth Monkey Island game.
4004640	4007160	The fifth Monkey Island game is coming.
4007160	4011120	I know some of the guys who worked on the music compositions for the original PC classics,
4011120	4014600	and they say that it's currently being planned amidst rumors.
4014600	4018760	However, LucasArts has so many things on its belt right now, including a Wii title that
4018760	4020040	is yet to be named.
4020040	4024960	Don't expect any revitalizations of its classic graphic adventures until 2008 at the earliest.
4024960	4027520	That's coming from RumorReporter.com.
4027520	4032000	You know, this is a game that needs to be made into a movie.
4032000	4033000	Monkey Island series.
4033000	4034120	It'd be awesome.
4034120	4037920	You know, with Sam & Max doing as well as it's doing critically, I mean, there's no
4037920	4040820	reason why they shouldn't bring this back, and it would be kind of interesting to see
4040820	4045400	it on a console, although these games will always kind of be PC games to me.
4045400	4048320	Yeah, they're pretty cool, though.
4048320	4053360	So we talked about it a while back that, you know, Playboy was going to be coming to Second
4053360	4054360	Life.
4054360	4060600	Well, they finally opened their doors in a fun little bunny-shaped island, and what can
4060600	4064760	you find possibly on Playboy Island, you may ask?
4064760	4072500	Well, plenty of bunny paraphernalia from its site, Playboy.com and ShopTheBunny.com.
4072500	4073500	Fake women?
4073500	4074720	Yes, fake women.
4074720	4083760	You'll be able to buy avatars or merchandise for your avatars, and also for, you know,
4083760	4086840	like fake bunny shirts and fake bunny ears.
4086840	4089880	Or you can buy real merchandise that, you know, can get shipped to your house.
4089880	4090880	All right.
4090880	4091880	Fair enough.
4091880	4092880	All right.
4092880	4093880	So slash Playboy instead of slash pizza.
4093880	4099440	I know they're going to have, you know, characters running around dressed up like the classic
4099440	4102840	bunnies, so that's kind of neat.
4102840	4107440	And yeah, I guess they're going to be also doing other, like, events and stuff like that,
4107440	4108440	so.
4108440	4109440	Events?
4109440	4111960	Pool party!
4111960	4113120	Fake pool party.
4113120	4114120	Fake barbecue.
4114120	4118200	But I love, I was reading some of the comments on the story, and it was kind of funny because
4118200	4120640	they were like, I'm just going to fake bomb this place.
4120640	4123920	Well, actually, RawSteelUT read my mind in chat.
4123920	4125920	Can you throw cocks at the Playboy models?
4125920	4131040	I think you can.
4131040	4134240	Why?
4134240	4137480	Come on, the cock throwing story in Second Life was funny.
4137480	4140280	So what if it was like four months old, it's still funny?
4140280	4141320	Kind of.
4141320	4143680	There you go.
4143680	4146560	If I actually played Second Life, I would want to throw some cocks.
4146560	4147560	I mean, come on.
4147560	4148560	What am I going to do?
4148560	4150600	Sit around and pretend I'm at the Playboy mansion?
4150600	4152480	I would build the massive cock launcher.
4152480	4157440	It would be a giant cannon.
4157440	4158760	That's all it would do.
4158760	4159980	Because it's funny.
4159980	4161640	That's why you would do it.
4161640	4162640	Exactly.
4162640	4163640	That and kittens.
4163640	4164640	It would shoot cocks and kittens.
4164640	4165640	Cocks and kittens.
4165640	4166640	Hooray.
4166640	4167640	You know, I'm kind of sad.
4167640	4170080	I don't know if we're allowed to say this or whatever, but what the hell?
4170080	4172280	I'm going to say it anyway because I've been drinking.
4172280	4176520	If you guys read about that Playboy event that happened at the Playboy mansion last
4176520	4183040	week with the whole, they were what, they were picking the gaming league folks or whatever.
4183040	4185480	We got invited to that and we couldn't go.
4185480	4187320	None of us could go.
4187320	4188320	Sucks.
4188320	4189820	I wanted to go.
4189820	4190820	We should have said Dark Side.
4190820	4193240	Dude, it was fucking lame.
4193240	4194240	Was it?
4194240	4195240	But it was at the Playboy mansion.
4195240	4196240	It was lame.
4196240	4197240	But it was at the Playboy mansion.
4197240	4201680	Dude, it's for the god damn, was it the professional gaming league?
4201680	4206000	They're trying to make gaming, they're putting it on TV.
4206000	4209920	I don't want to watch people play games.
4209920	4210920	I fucking hate that.
4210920	4213840	I want to play games or play games against other people.
4213840	4216880	I don't want to have people watch me play games.
4216880	4220200	Instead of watching basketball on TV, why not go play basketball?
4220200	4221200	Exactly.
4221200	4222880	That's why I don't watch sports on TV.
4222880	4224080	Well, you're just weird.
4224080	4227920	But there's a lot of people out there that do enjoy watching other people play games.
4227920	4231440	Don't you have friends that will come over and sit on the couch and watch you play?
4231440	4232440	No.
4232440	4233440	They don't really want to play themselves?
4233440	4234440	They just will watch you play?
4234440	4238840	never comes over to watch me play, and Nellie hates watching me play games. She's like,
4238840	4241000	I want to watch TV instead!
4241000	4245480	Okay, Jamie, you do this to some extent, right? You've told stories on this show before when
4245480	4250080	you and Dan were gaming together that you like would help him through Resident Evil,
4250080	4252000	but you would just be kind of content watching him, right?
4252000	4253000	Yeah.
4253000	4257880	So, would it be fair to say that some people are okay with just watching people play games?
4257880	4258880	Yeah.
4258880	4259880	I don't know.
4259880	4262400	Well, great. They can go ahead and start up their professional gaming league. It'll be
4262400	4266400	like the fucking XFL. It'll be around for a couple of years, and then it will fade into
4266400	4274220	dust, like it should, because no one wants to watch this shit. I mean, seriously, gamers
4274220	4275220	don't even watch...
4275220	4277640	But we were actually playing together.
4277640	4285080	Okay, remember that stupid show on G4 Arena, okay? Remember that? I mean, granted, it had
4285080	4289580	an interesting idea, let's watch gamers play games, and it sucked. It sucked really, really
4289580	4291880	bad. You know why? Because it's watching people play games.
4291880	4298120	The problem with Arena was just the way the show was kind of formulated. I don't think
4298120	4300440	it was the...
4300440	4305320	I don't give a shit about Joe Nobody, who fucking is like the Halo champ or something
4305320	4308920	like that, and ooh, ooh, he got a headshot in the game. No, I think I'm just going to
4308920	4312640	go back and play my own game now, thank you very much. I'm not going to subscribe to your
4312640	4319220	pay-per-view event sponsored by fucking, you know, I don't know, Rockstar or something
4319220	4324700	like that, so I can watch you play some stupid game that I could be playing right now and
4324700	4329800	win $50,000 and go, I'm the fucking awesome, let me make my own keyboard brand and sell
4329800	4333320	it for Uber money.
4333320	4342000	Are you done? No? No, I'm done. You're such a dick, I swear to God.
4342000	4349300	Okay, RawsteelUT brings up an excellent point. How about StarCade? StarCade was awesome,
4349300	4353280	and you watched other people play games, or Nick Arcade for that matter. Those games rocked.
4353280	4358600	Okay, bring that shit back. I would love to see that. That's good, but fucking watching,
4358600	4364160	you know, clan members or whatever fucking play multiplayer games and shit, that's kind
4364160	4369840	of boring. But I'd be down for like an 80s-style show or something where it's just people facing
4369840	4372680	off in the arcades like their forefathers did.
4372680	4376320	So you will watch people play games under the right circumstances.
4376320	4379520	I'll play arcade games. Liar. Liar.
4379520	4384560	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Liar is not the right word. The word I'm thinking
4384560	4388400	of starts with an H. Homosexual?
4388400	4390520	Hypocrite. Oh, hypocrite.
4390520	4393560	No, Rob, that's just you.
4393560	4399000	All right. Anyway, that show's not on TV anymore, so fuck that, I don't care.
4399000	4405640	All right, anyhow. And M60. Oh no, I guess GS68 said it first. Hentai? Was that the word
4405640	4409680	you were thinking? Hentai?
4409680	4410680	Dear Rob.
4410680	4417080	Speaking of Hentai, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet every week.
4417080	4419520	For YowieBoyFun.com.
4419520	4423360	And I don't know what she's looking at, but she likes to, oh yes, explicit.
4423360	4426240	Are you going to YowieCon?
4426240	4427240	Maybe.
4427240	4428240	Of course.
4428240	4432640	Everyone's trying to invite me to it.
4432640	4437360	Why would you go to YowieCon? I don't even want to go to YowieCon. Why would you go to
4437360	4438360	YowieCon?
4438360	4443040	No, because everybody like, you know, all those groups and cosplayers, they all want
4443040	4446280	me to, oh, come on, go.
4446280	4451300	As I understand it, let's talk about Yowie for a minute. Why not? This is an appropriate
4451300	4457440	lead into Dark Soccer's website of the week. Let's talk about a little bit of Yowie.
4457440	4464200	For those of you guys that don't know what Yowie is, it's art that is, you explain it,
4464200	4467480	Dark Soccer. I can't. It's man-on-man action.
4467480	4474640	It's basically, imagine like the uber sweet, sappy, you know, typical heterosexual relationship
4474640	4477160	and then change the gender of one of them to male.
4477160	4482640	Okay. Good definition. But as I understand it, Yowie is not made for gay men. It's not
4482640	4484160	gay porn. It's not gay anime.
4484160	4485840	It's made for straight girls.
4485840	4492040	Yowie is made for girls. So, I get asked all the time because Yowie is man-on-man action
4492040	4498480	and you're going to YowieCon. And I say, okay, well, as a gay man, the last place I want
4498480	4507840	to be on the planet is a hotel full of horny straight women. I mean, really. So stop asking
4507840	4514080	me if I'm going to go to YowieCon because the answer is no.
4514080	4518560	YowieCon maybe because I love my lesbians. I love my lesbians. I might go to YowieCon
4518560	4519560	but I don't know about YowieCon.
4519560	4524360	All right. Sorry. Sorry for the aside, Dark Soccer. I apologize for cutting into your
4524360	4528360	precious website of the week time. We needed to have some Yowie chat. Can we do your website
4528360	4529360	of the week now?
4529360	4530360	Sure.
4530360	4531360	All right. Here we go.
4531360	4532360	Because I'm just playing with the stupid thing anyway.
4532360	4533360	All right. Here we go.
4533360	4544920	So, the website of the week is fallingsandgame.com which I have no idea what the purpose of this
4544920	4550480	game is for anyway. But it's really stupid. All I'm doing is just watching it do shit.
4550480	4558720	Yeah, it's a game from the same people who do cat or was it cat with bow golf or something?
4558720	4562600	I don't know but I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing other than drawing lines and trying
4562600	4566840	to make this thing destroy my sand slides.
4566840	4570920	It's that thing that's running around on the outside. You're supposed to hit it with sand.
4570920	4572520	Is this like Yoshi's Touch and Go?
4572520	4575680	I've been hitting it with sand and it's not doing anything.
4575680	4576840	Are you sure this game is fun?
4576840	4583720	Because it explodes. They have one that's also with slugs and you have to pour salt
4583720	4584720	on them.
4584720	4591440	I hate slugs. I'm actually slug phobic people. You now know what my deepest fear is, slugs
4591440	4592440	and snails.
4592440	4597640	I don't know. Because I keep pouring sand on it. I think it's the type of sand I'm using.
4597640	4599760	Grow sand.
4599760	4606200	I want the sea monkey the game. Or that I can flush them down the toilet.
4606200	4611680	That's the only thing missing from Sims 2 Pets.
4611680	4612680	Funerals?
4612680	4614680	No, flushing animals down the toilet.
4614680	4618360	Funerals? Fish funerals? Remember when I had fish?
4618360	4619360	This is fantastic.
4619360	4622000	I prefer to call them funerals.
4622000	4624320	It's just like, what the hell is this crap?
4624320	4626680	Alright, give that URL one more time.
4626680	4632000	FallingSandGame.com. I'm like, oil? What the hell is the oil thing? Oh, I see what it is.
4632000	4634920	Dude, this is like the biggest ball of sand freakin' ever.
4634920	4639240	FallingSand.com. That gets dark, sacra, steel, and thermal.
4639240	4640240	Dude, fire!
4640240	4641240	Alright.
4641240	4644400	Dude, I just set the ball of sand on fire. That's great.
4644400	4645400	Look at it.
4645400	4646760	Can I move on? Are you finished?
4646760	4647760	No, this is great.
4647760	4651800	What is up with you people tonight and not being able to finish in a reasonable amount
4651800	4652800	of time?
4652800	4653800	I am paying attention.
4653800	4657040	I am playing with the sand game.
4657040	4659360	Can I talk about BlizzCon while you're playing with the sand game?
4659360	4660360	Sure.
4660360	4662280	Because I'm a little upset about this.
4662280	4666400	As you know, I've been gone for the past two weeks, and during that time, tickets for BlizzCon
4666400	4668000	went on sale.
4668000	4673000	And I actually was going to go to BlizzCon this year, while I get home and find out that
4673000	4679280	the tickets went on sale June 13th, and then promptly sold out on June 15th.
4679280	4682520	So tickets for BlizzCon 2007 already sold out.
4682520	4686480	If you haven't heard, it's August 3rd and 4th at the Anaheim Convention Center.
4686480	4688720	And you know, if you go, you're supposed to get all this free stuff.
4688720	4693000	I, however, will not be going, and I'm a little bit bitter about it.
4693000	4694000	I know...
4694000	4695000	Are you going to cry?
4695000	4696000	A little bit.
4696000	4697000	Actually, no, I'm not going to cry.
4697000	4698000	I'm going to get angsty.
4698000	4711120	And you know what happens on the show when people get angsty?
4711120	4713680	FUs of the week time, Dark Soccer, start us off.
4713680	4716480	I'm trying to get the information out of my purse, because I'm going to tell people exactly
4716480	4718760	where the fuck I went.
4718760	4722520	Fuck you to the idiot at Quiznos.
4722520	4725820	I wanted my sandwich.
4725820	4734360	I specifically wanted a Philly cheesesteak sandwich on whole wheat bread with no mayonnaise
4734360	4736280	and no sauce on it.
4736280	4739640	Just meat and cheese and onions on wheat.
4739640	4740640	And I didn't want it burned either.
4740640	4741640	I want it toasted.
4741640	4748660	So the guy's like, I'm like, okay, I want to go.
4748660	4750320	Were you being served by Ozzy Osbourne?
4750320	4753600	No, I was being served by a moron.
4753600	4756520	And so I was like, okay, dude, I want a Philly cheesesteak.
4756520	4757520	No mayonnaise.
4757520	4761120	So he starts putting mayonnaise and I'm like, dude, I said no mayonnaise.
4761120	4763400	Oh, I'm sorry.
4763400	4765440	And then he puts it in and I get it.
4765440	4766440	There's like, okay, prime ribs.
4766440	4767440	No, I said Philly cheesesteak.
4767440	4768440	Oh, okay.
4768440	4769440	I'll go add cheese.
4769440	4770440	What?
4770440	4776360	And then he rings it up as a Philly, I was like, dude, okay, first of all, you bring
4776360	4777960	me up as a prime rib.
4777960	4778960	It's a different price.
4778960	4782960	He's like, oh, well, this is cheaper, so I'll just charge you for that.
4782960	4783960	Whatever.
4783960	4785960	So finally, I just ended up saying, where's your manager?
4785960	4788160	Oh, the manager's only here in the morning.
4788160	4789160	Okay.
4789160	4795840	So it's quiz nose number one, one, two, nine on, what is that road that's off of Zinfandel?
4795840	4796920	I don't know.
4796920	4797920	Not white rock.
4797920	4799920	Just call it off of Zinfandel.
4799920	4801240	Zinfandel and 50.
4801240	4802960	It's off of Zinfandel near 50.
4802960	4803960	Yeah.
4803960	4806720	By the, across the street from Target and Cheezer's Pizza.
4806720	4807720	Olson, it's Olson drive.
4807720	4808720	Olson.
4808720	4809720	I used to work on that road.
4809720	4810720	Okay.
4810720	4815520	It's Olson in Rancho, Cambodia.
4815520	4819200	And the guy's name was, I can't pronounce it, but it's A-K-O-B.
4819200	4821680	A-K-O-B.
4821680	4825720	Don't never let this guy make you a sandwich because he'll burn it.
4825720	4827560	You saw my sandwich, Rob.
4827560	4828560	It was pretty burnt.
4828560	4835140	It was, it was, I just came back from Philadelphia and you can't get cheesesteaks anywhere else
4835140	4836140	like you can there.
4836140	4837920	There's a reason they are Philly cheesesteaks.
4837920	4838920	I know.
4838920	4839920	Everything else is suck.
4839920	4842960	I have never had such idiotic service anywhere.
4842960	4847720	And I'm like, I can understand, you know, missing it once, but the dude wasn't even
4847720	4848720	freaking listening to me.
4848720	4851080	Anytime I said something, I was like, I want a small drink.
4851080	4852560	He gives me a fucking large cup.
4852560	4854120	I'm like, dude, small.
4854120	4855680	Jamie, maybe he was high.
4855680	4859560	No, he was, he didn't, I can tell him somebody's high.
4859560	4861320	He was not red-eyed.
4861320	4864920	He was not stealing the cheese out of the, the thing.
4864920	4870640	He sounded, he just was speaking in a whisper and not listening.
4870640	4875480	He was looking off in this face like, dude, I don't care how much you hate your job.
4875480	4876840	You can at least do it right.
4876840	4877840	You know?
4877840	4878840	So whatever.
4878840	4879840	All right.
4879840	4880840	Thank you.
4880840	4886880	A dark soccer for your very specific and directed eggs tonight, Loki, your F use of the week
4886880	4895760	goes to Christopher's desk for being rotted that is really foul.
4895760	4902280	Like I had to put a cup over the giant pile of rot.
4902280	4905920	It's literally, there's like stuff growing.
4905920	4908600	I'm creating a wall with cans.
4908600	4909600	I don't have enough yet.
4909600	4911840	So I have to drink a couple more cans.
4911840	4914120	Is that it?
4914120	4920640	My F you of the week goes to myself and the target that's across the street from said
4920640	4926600	quiz knows because I was there and I was buying some diet soda.
4926600	4930080	In fact, the IBC root beer I'm consuming right now that's mixed with Malibu.
4930080	4934560	I was buying that and as I was pulling it off the shelf, I, it got caught on the cream
4934560	4935920	soda next to it.
4935920	4940080	And so all the IBC cream soda went all over the floor and there was breaking glass everywhere.
4940080	4943520	It was, it made a beautiful noise, but F you to myself for being such a klutz.
4943520	4945480	I told you fucking cream soda sucks.
4945480	4947680	See now you know.
4947680	4948680	All right.
4948680	4955800	Uh, explicit and the F use tonight, um, uh, F used to having a flat tire during the road
4955800	4960280	while I was trying to go to my cousin's graduation and brought a lot of stuff.
4960280	4966840	Luckily I came in, came into the party, um, rather than not being able to make it after
4966840	4972840	he goes to pretty much everybody keeps overrated the over 9,000 joke.
4972840	4974240	What is the over 9,000 joke?
4974240	4975240	Dare I ask?
4975240	4976240	Okay.
4976240	4981600	If you go to YouTube or just type in over 9,000 up at Google.com.
4981600	4982960	Is it a Dragon Ball Z thing?
4982960	4983960	Yeah.
4983960	4984960	Okay.
4984960	4985960	I have seen it.
4985960	4987960	Power level is over 9,000!
4987960	4988960	DMN.
4988960	4993920	DMN linked me to something or sent us a song or something and I wanted to poke him in the
4993920	4994920	eye with a fork.
4994920	4995920	Yes.
4995920	4996920	I know what you're talking about now.
4996920	4997920	Yeah, exactly.
4997920	4999760	I hear that almost every freaking day.
4999760	5005200	Um, let's see, an F goes to my co-workers for trying to make me break, um, New Year's
5005200	5006200	resolution.
5006200	5009760	I'm not sure if you guys will know what the New Year's resolution might, gave up for the
5009760	5010760	whole year.
5010760	5012760	Well, dare I ask what it is?
5012760	5013760	Not erections again, is it?
5013760	5014760	No, no, no.
5014760	5015760	You gave up sex or masturbating?
5015760	5016760	Masturbation.
5016760	5019360	You gave up masturbating for a whole year?
5019360	5020360	Yeah.
5020360	5021360	Oh my God.
5021360	5023240	Are you having sex with women at least?
5023240	5024840	Uh, sadly no.
5024840	5026160	Oh my God.
5026160	5027160	You're gonna die.
5027160	5031120	You should just get a hooker.
5031120	5032120	For real.
5032120	5037680	Wow, you're, you're a brave man, that's all I have to say.
5037680	5044160	Let's see, another F goes to everybody, I'm still talking about the 300 Sparta joke.
5044160	5045960	Combined with a Chuck Norris.
5045960	5049040	Hey, I got a shirt that says, this is Zelda.
5049040	5050040	That was actually funny.
5050040	5051040	Yeah, I got that.
5051040	5053040	That was, that was a good times.
5053040	5056080	F you to some of the kids in shotgun for asking me for money.
5056080	5060760	Okay, if you, I don't know, I'm not sure how many, how many, how much money these kids
5060760	5063040	spend on a con.
5063040	5071800	Especially with their like $110 swords and their $50 Naruto jacket, et cetera, et cetera,
5071800	5072800	et cetera.
5072800	5075880	Oh God, we're gonna be starting on that.
5075880	5079320	Let's see, and well, that's all for now.
5079320	5083120	I always like how he always leaves it with, that's all for now.
5083120	5085360	And then he'll be back like in a year.
5085360	5089040	Here's some F use I've collected over the past year that I'd like to share with you
5089040	5090040	here.
5090040	5092320	Actually, actually I found something.
5092320	5095300	I found something just for you.
5095300	5096300	This is just for you.
5096300	5097300	Jonas
5097300	5125720	Isn't that one of the most God awful things you've ever heard that was made by DMN.
5125720	5130800	Oh gee, didn't see that coming.
5130800	5133320	I'll send you the MP3 later, Jonas.
5133320	5137440	Anyhow, anyways, can we get back to games please?
5137440	5143200	So something kind of cool came down to the Xbox Live Video Marketplace and once I saw
5143200	5148720	it, I thought, well, I don't know, I had to watch it, but I didn't, so.
5148720	5153040	Basically the Xbox Live Marketplace, among other things, got a whole bunch of anime.
5153040	5158880	So that's pretty awesome, including Guyver, Trinity Blood, Gunslinger Girl, Speedgrapher,
5158880	5167200	Basilik, Sayuki, Kitty Grade, Genku, I can't even, The Count of Monte Cristo, whatever.
5167200	5172240	Desert Punk, Last Exile, Rumbling Hearts, Galaxy Railways, Gilgamesh, and Lupin the
5172240	5174120	Third Part 2.
5174120	5180520	But it also got Akira, and Akira in HD, which is fucking awesome.
5180520	5183320	So definitely worth checking out, especially if you're an anime fan, because that's one
5183320	5186700	of the best anime movies I think of all time.
5186700	5192160	And I believe Lady Death was also on there in HD, so that's something else.
5192160	5194960	Then beyond all that, National Geographic shit.
5194960	5199240	So yeah, National Geographic Adventure, and yeah.
5199240	5203220	So, watch some Akira in HD.
5203220	5205160	Can I tell you a secret?
5205160	5208500	Most people assume that because I do this show, I watch a ton of anime, which is so
5208500	5209500	not true.
5209500	5210960	I've never seen Akira.
5210960	5211960	Why?
5211960	5213160	I just haven't.
5213160	5215080	The manga's better, don't watch the anime.
5215080	5216240	No, no, no, no.
5216240	5218840	The anime is fucking awesome, and you know what?
5218840	5219840	I watched it.
5219840	5220840	Well, I started a fight.
5220840	5225680	I remember going to this, you know, it was a place called Steamers or whatever, it was
5225680	5230520	a coffee shop slash video rental place.
5230520	5235360	It was like one of the mom and pop shops or something around in Elorado Hills.
5235360	5240240	So I went one day, bored, and so I was like, I'm going to go rent something.
5240240	5245280	So I went to the cartoon section, I don't know why, and I saw Akira, you know, rated
5245280	5250400	R, so I picked it up, and of course a car at that time.
5250400	5252320	But it's fucking awesome, dude.
5252320	5257960	It has, you know, full frontal, has people's limbs getting blown off, motorcycle chases.
5257960	5261560	Oh, sorry, I heard full frontal and I woke up.
5261560	5264080	Space satellite lasers.
5264080	5268080	It does have the bike, however, the cool thing about the manga is that the movie is like
5268080	5269080	manga-lite.
5269080	5275720	There's like, at least 30 chapters where Kaneda is not even anywhere, he just disappears.
5275720	5276720	It's a fucking awesome movie.
5276720	5279280	One of the main characters.
5279280	5283120	It's got a character that looks like Louie Anderson.
5283120	5284120	So you gotta...
5284120	5285120	That is true.
5285120	5288040	You've got to watch it, and he kind of sounds like you, too.
5288040	5289960	I hate Louie Anderson, you're not selling me this.
5289960	5291960	And when he gets killed.
5291960	5293960	And 50-year-old children.
5293960	5296240	Can we please move on?
5296240	5297240	He's like old Louie Anderson.
5297240	5299120	Can we finish part A tonight at some point?
5299120	5300120	And the clowns!
5300120	5303880	If old Louie Anderson, oh yeah, the clowns, if old Louie Anderson could like do, you know,
5303880	5306400	psychokinetic shit.
5306400	5307680	That's fucking awesome.
5307680	5311640	Is this, has this show really lasted five years somehow?
5311640	5312640	Not yet!
5312640	5313640	We're not there yet.
5313640	5316400	That's right, it could all end tonight, boys and girls.
5316400	5317400	Crash!
5317400	5318400	We're getting close.
5318400	5320680	Okay, can we talk about something else, Rob?
5320680	5321680	Sure.
5321680	5322680	Read the manga.
5322680	5326160	Shut the fuck up and read a story.
5326160	5327160	Okay.
5327160	5328160	Well guess what?
5328160	5333720	You know that Castlevania film that was supposed to be done by Paul W.S. Anderson?
5333720	5336200	Well he said, fuck y'all.
5336200	5337200	Not really.
5337200	5339400	He said, I'm working on other projects.
5339400	5342800	Like he's remaking Death Race.
5342800	5343800	And that is awesome.
5343800	5345800	Yeah, it's more priority over Castlevania.
5345800	5346800	I agree.
5346800	5347800	Yes.
5347800	5351960	However, the one that they are getting to replace him is Sylvain White, who brought
5351960	5360920	us such classics as Stomp the Yard, and I'll always know what you did last summer.
5360920	5363680	Such great American cinema classics.
5363680	5367120	He is quoted saying, most of the vampire films that have been present are set in the future
5367120	5371760	from Blade to Underworld, and I was attracted to the chance to make a dark, epic period
5371760	5374640	movie that almost had an anime feel to it.
5374640	5377720	Well there's Castlevania right the fuck there, so.
5377720	5379320	Uh, Van Helsing?
5379320	5380320	Anybody?
5380320	5382720	Yeah, but that wasn't a good movie.
5382720	5384720	It just had Hugh Jackman being sexy, and that's it.
5384720	5387040	But it had vampires in it, it was a period piece.
5387040	5389440	But it was a bad movie.
5389440	5391320	What about Bram Stoker's Dracula?
5391320	5392320	That was sexy!
5392320	5393320	Oh my god.
5393320	5394320	Anybody?
5394320	5396320	How about Interview with the Vampire?
5396320	5399120	That movie was so hot, I would make love to it if I could.
5399120	5401280	That was sort of multiple...
5401280	5403640	It was part period, part present, part...
5403640	5404640	You don't understand that.
5404640	5405640	Part just, like, gay.
5405640	5406640	It's like...
5406640	5407640	It's a gay movie.
5407640	5408640	It really is.
5408640	5409640	I just expected making out all over the place.
5409640	5410640	For real.
5410640	5411640	That was a good movie.
5411640	5414680	He probably just doesn't watch a lot of those classic films, you know, because he's in a
5414680	5419360	whole other, you know, decade now, so.
5419360	5421920	Who watches any of that stuff?
5421920	5431800	Well, I have to say that maybe, maybe he's, he might have some, I mean, if he gets the
5431800	5435400	imagery off, then that'll be good, but you know what's also though interesting that he's
5435400	5439920	going to be directing is Ronin, Frank Miller.
5439920	5446520	As long as it's not Paul W.S. Anderson or Riebel, you know, we need someone else to
5446520	5448560	make fun of for making crappy movies.
5448560	5451840	Everyone has to start off somewhere, right?
5451840	5455600	Well he did do I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer.
5455600	5458040	That's a springboard, I'll say.
5458040	5462160	I'm going to try to have some faith because you know me and my Castlevania, oh my god.
5462160	5465840	I will withhold judgment until the film is done, that's only fair, right?
5465840	5466840	Right, Halo.
5466840	5467840	Everybody deserves a chance.
5467840	5468840	Right, Halo.
5468840	5469840	What?
5469840	5470840	Halo.
5470840	5471840	Halo.
5471840	5473600	You said yourself that you passed judgment on Halo.
5473600	5474600	I just.
5474600	5475600	Have you learned your lesson, Rob?
5475600	5477600	I so got pwned just now.
5477600	5478600	Have you learned your lesson?
5478600	5480360	No, I'll never learn my lesson.
5480360	5482720	Haven't you learned that after five years?
5482720	5489680	I know, but I'm not going to tell, I'll always know where Jigglypuff is hiding last summer.
5489680	5493640	And now I think it's about time to say goodbye to part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
5493640	5496940	We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back after a little break with more of
5496940	5498600	Orange Lounge Radio.
5498600	5501800	For those of you guys listening live here on Sunday night, you get part B just in a
5501800	5505240	few minutes, but for those of you guys listening to us on our audio archive or podcast feed,
5505240	5506600	you just have to wait a couple days.
5506600	5509400	We'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5509400	5514920	We prefer to call it actually Orange Lounge Radio Championship Edition because it is technically
5514920	5518600	a brand new sequel to the original Orange Lounge Radio episode.
5518600	5520160	Yeah, Loki, shut up.
5520160	5524880	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
5524880	5525880	a week.
5525880	5552440	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
