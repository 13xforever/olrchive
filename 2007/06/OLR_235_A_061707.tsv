13903	25110	Tonight, June 17th, 2007, Soul Calibur preps its fourth game for the PlayStation 3 and 360, Sony builds itself a blog, and has Project Hammer gotten some nails in its coffin?
31912	35915	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35975	36795	It's good to be back.
37236	44661	We were off last week and we missed you guys, but we're back this week to talk about the latest in video games, the gaming world, gaming culture, and all that good stuff.
45021	55608	My name is Rob Roberts and with me here, as always, right by my side, hanging on to my arm, clutching it, sucking the very life out of it, is Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55628	57670	Ripping it off and beating you with it, maybe.
58570	61012	Isn't that like an attack you can do in Dead Rising, actually?
61909	65551	It happened in Shaun of the Dead, except they ripped off his legs and then went after zombies with him.
66352	67293	That was the best scene in the movie.
67313	68213	OMG, spoilers.
68914	70695	Who hasn't seen Shaun of the Dead yet?
71255	72576	Go see Hot Fuzz, everybody, by the way.
72596	74097	Here goes the chat room going, me, me, me.
74677	76719	Also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
77816	78176	Hello.
78457	79718	Have you seen Shaun of the Dead, Loki?
80278	81719	Um, twice.
81920	82680	It's good times.
82740	93069	Like, I have to admit, when DarkSakura, like, you know, because she does movie nights once in a while at her place, and I admit when she first, you know, was like, let's watch Shaun of the Dead, I was like, oh, God, all right, fine, we'll watch a movie.
93089	93830	It's only two hours.
93850	95091	It was actually really good.
95231	101597	I don't know if you were there a couple years ago, but we did Shaun of the Dead, and then we watched the new Dawn of the Dead.
101737	102938	Actually, I think it was in the reverse.
102958	105400	We watched the new Dawn of the Dead, and then Shaun of the Dead, and
106160	107561	I wasn't there because I never saw the new Dawn of the Dead.
107581	109062	Yeah, the new Dawn of the Dead sucked.
109522	110583	Shaun of the Dead was awesome, though.
110963	111804	And Hot Fuzz is better.
112424	113104	I still haven't seen Hot Fuzz.
113124	113745	Hot Fuzz is great.
113845	114745	I've seen it twice now.
116266	117847	Well, give me one of yours.
117907	119648	I went to see it with Ranma.
119948	121909	I seriously can't remember the last... That's right.
121929	123890	When we left, you guys went to the movie.
123911	125672	I guess I go see Transformers early.
126032	126292	Do you?
126312	127052	Before it comes out.
127212	127633	Lucky you.
127673	128733	How do you spend that?
128753	129654	Through work and stuff?
129674	130234	Yeah, through work.
130394	130875	Oh, very nice.
131215	131615	A few days.
132028	132628	I can't wait.
132728	134449	Are we a movie podcast?
135129	139091	Hey, they're making a game based on it, and it's going to be fucking awesome.
139251	141753	And they should make a game out of Shaun of the Dead, shouldn't they?
142033	142533	They should.
142993	143533	Absolutely.
143553	144554	Hot Fuzz would be funny, too.
145114	146875	A romantic comedy with zombies in the game.
147215	154018	One of these days, I seriously think the last movie I saw in the theater was Notes on a Scandal, which they should not make into a video game.
154158	155939	I don't think that would be a very interesting video game.
157280	159561	You can control Judi Dench as she creates...
160487	161431	Lesbian Scandal.
161973	162836	It'd be wonderful.
163920	164503	Alright, anyhow.
164864	166049	And you take notes on it.
167316	168717	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
168757	168797	Um...
195819	200003	Wow, I've been spending the whole week looking for my copy of Elite Beat Agents because Dan wants to play it.
200863	209431	And playing some World of Warcraft, like hardly any, because I still want Burning Crusade so I can play a hot little elf.
212253	212693	Very cool.
213294	214375	You still haven't gotten Burning Crusade?
215496	216857	What money do I have, Rob?
216877	217858	I don't know.
218478	220480	You certainly don't get paid for this, so I don't know.
221184	223947	Yeah, I don't have much money, so no.
224307	224868	Oh, sorry to hear it.
224888	226509	Unless someone in the chatroom wants to buy it for me.
226569	227470	Sell a pinball machine.
228031	228611	They're not mine.
228871	229352	Oh, okay.
229992	230853	They're the spouse's.
231153	231454	I see.
233155	233396	All right.
234016	234917	Loki, how was your gaming week?
235441	236882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
256195	268126	I just want to verify, because I haven't been reading up too much on Fable 2, you will still able to be a bisexual evil warlord, correct?
268587	270249	Uh, yes, and you can get pregnant.
271690	273332	If I'm a male, that might be difficult.
273772	274693	Yeah, that might be difficult.
274753	275033	Alright.
275394	275734	Yeah, but...
277513	279518	That would be a real fable right there.
280460	282125	There once was a pregnant man.
282846	283889	They definitely do not, like,
286627	287488	I want to be uber evil.
312180	312980	so it's actually pretty cool.
313881	322404	The other game I played was Monster Madness and now this game I was kind of looking forward to check out because it reminded me of Zombies Ate My Neighbors and who doesn't like Zombies Ate My Neighbors?
322864	325765	This game is no Zombies Ate My Neighbors and it's awful.
326445	330867	The controls in it, awful and it's way too damn hard so I don't recommend it at all.
332827	337349	The other games I played, Mad Trax, I actually tried that out a little bit and that was pretty fun.
337779	341060	I played through a few levels of that, although there really isn't too much to the game.
341100	342641	You can probably beat it pretty quick.
342941	346722	So they're kind of trying to sell those additional add-ons for it.
347102	348042	I don't know, not my thing.
349343	351703	Didn't play Pac-Man Championship Edition.
352063	354544	I looked at it, downloaded the demo, still haven't played it yet.
355204	356105	But it's Pac-Man.
356765	358605	Oh, I'm sorry, it's a sequel to Pac-Man.
359046	360466	I have more to say on this, but I'll wait my turn.
360486	361386	Yeah, Dan downloaded that.
361446	363187	I was like, okay, what the hell?
363407	366728	He was like, I came home, all I was doing was freaking screaming at the ghosts.
368906	370066	Doesn't he do that all the time?
370666	371727	He was really screaming at me.
371747	373507	He was, like, calling them bastards.
374087	375848	I was like, dude, you sound like me talking to my computer.
377508	382609	And then I downloaded the Project Sylphid demo today, but I forgot to play that.
382689	386350	But I finished Super Paper Mario.
387291	387711	Congrats.
388411	392812	Yeah, the end is, like, you saw it coming throughout the entire game, and...
393772	397714	It's just like, once you finish it, you're rewarded with... Don't you fucking spoil it!
397994	398834	No, I'm not going to spoil it.
398854	405617	I'm just saying, once you finish the game, you're rewarded with, hey, you get to go back to this one level and fight 100 people, and they'll take another couple hours.
406057	406557	Fuck you.
406617	408058	I mean, it's awful.
408378	409418	That's what the whole game is.
409478	412840	It's full of this, like, fight 100 people, do that for two hours.
412860	417341	So, are you saying at the end of the game, you get told, we're sorry, Mario, but our princess is in another castle?
417401	418562	No, it's more like...
419082	420784	We're sorry, Mario, but your game sucks.
420904	422585	It's more like, thank you for playing through the game.
422825	424727	No replay value whatsoever.
425007	426148	Sell it back to GameStop.
426168	426868	Thank you very much.
427349	429550	So, that's pretty much what I'm going to have to do.
430091	431712	I did download Zelda 2.
432052	434354	I don't know why, but I've actually been playing this game.
434374	435775	You can lend it to me before you sell it back.
437557	438458	You can borrow my copy.
438478	439098	I'm not playing it.
439218	440539	If you really want to play it, I'll loan you mine.
441020	441700	It's a great game.
441760	443822	It's just, you know, after you...
444284	445345	Played through all of it.
445405	449987	It's just kind of... There's a bunch of side quests you can do that have no reward whatsoever.
450007	450808	What, Zelda 2?
451288	451848	No, not Zelda 2.
451948	452929	Oh, I was talking about Super Mario.
453269	454209	No, Zelda 2 is awesome.
454230	455550	I was like, Zelda 2 is fucking rad.
455570	457011	I don't know why people diss it.
457091	458432	It's like one of the worst in the series.
458512	458872	It's great.
458892	459572	It's really weird.
459592	463034	Go fucking play Wand of Gamelon if you want to see the worst ones in the series, okay?
463154	464915	It doesn't feel like Zelda at all.
465015	466236	It's just very strange.
466436	469358	And I remember playing through it and it being very hard.
469718	471039	It still is kind of hard, but...
472165	473505	I don't know, I can understand it more.
474065	477366	Why did the name of everything really strange names is beyond me?
477606	478386	I am Error.
478486	479366	Yeah, I remember that.
479726	481727	I went in and I'm like, oh, there's that.
481747	489288	I think that was actually supposed to have been something else, and it programmed in wrong, if I remember right.
489528	489848	Really?
489888	490648	With the translation.
491168	491408	Huh.
491828	492849	I want that on a shirt.
493509	494909	I am Error.
494949	496129	There's got to be a shirt somewhere.
496169	496929	I'm sure there is.
496989	498510	You can just have one made, you know?
498530	499710	Maybe his name is just Error.
499870	500130	I mean...
500948	502650	I'm going to name my firstborn Error.
502730	503672	I mean, fucking look at that.
505954	509659	That would be a horrible thing for parents to do, to name their baby Error.
509719	510941	With the middle name Oops.
514105	515406	Error, Oops, Summers.
515727	516007	Love it.
517075	529378	Then, finally, the last game I've been playing, and this is weird because I've actually played this game more than I've played Guitar Hero, but it uses the Guitar Hero controller for the 360, and it's a game for the PC called Fret Nice.
529738	536860	The best way to describe it is it's like playing Loco Roco with a guitar, and it actually works pretty well.
537329	539850	and they've got some really interesting level designs and stuff.
540070	543650	The only bad thing about it is it's only three levels long, but it's a lot of fun.
543850	546171	So I recommend downloading that.
546471	556093	I may post a link to it in my blog on all games so that you can actually find it because it's on some foreign website or something.
556333	561415	But it's cool and it's free, so I highly recommend doing that.
562175	563455	I don't know, I don't play the
564226	585813	Guitar Hero, it's weird we did this thing on Friday last week that it was basically this sales team building thing and we had to perform songs on stage and they have video of it but anyways they had like one person had the air guitar so I had to do the air guitar part of it because I didn't want to sing
586471	590576	Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero Guitar Hero
609562	636216	or because you were on the internet radio program about music video games therefore you can pass every catastrophic and DDR oh yeah back in the day maybe I could three quarters of those back in the day I wasn't so fat exactly because I played more DDR exactly then you get married and you don't have DDR time and it all goes downhill from there anything else about your gaming week you want to share um
638757	640939	Oh yeah, I played more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
641640	642341	Congratulations.
643342	648307	I got my last copy of Saints Row, and so we're going to be landing those five systems together very soon.
649008	649469	Very cool.
649909	651070	Just in time for the sequel, maybe?
651911	654054	Saints Row 2, that's not coming out for a while, but...
654941	656482	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
680038	681759	in New York City, and that was a great time.
681779	690025	We actually went to Dave & Buster's in Times Square and just kind of messed around there for a little while and played this game called Jumpin' Jackpot, which is hilarious.
690045	691206	They have one of these at Roseville Golf Line.
691226	698972	Actually, it's the virtual jump rope with the lights going around, and it plays this really super gay rave music while you're jumping.
700072	702014	But it's hard, and it's crack.
702054	703855	You keep putting money in over and over.
704155	705016	And we played some DDR.
705036	705696	They had, like, Superdome.
705716	708398	We were playing a bunch of stuff, and it was a good time.
708638	709439	What are you laughing at?
710652	714953	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
740023	740444	Yes!
741306	742088	Dave and Busters.
742108	746236	You know, I have enough tickets to buy an Xbox 360 game, but I'm just not interested in anything that they have there.
746958	748782	Anyhow, so big thanks to all the listeners that showed up.
750752	758857	Also went, Ranma took me to this video game shop, or I think he was the one that led the way, I mean all of us kind of went there, all of us that were still together at this time.
759137	773285	We went to this video game shop near Aster Place, where the big cube is, and they had like tons of stuff, like I sent you the picture of the Hello Kitty Dreamcast, and all these important stuff, but they were selling old school NES games, and my friend has an old school Nintendo game.
773505	773985	Thanks for watching!
799190	800051	So it's very interesting.
800071	801191	Was it in the box?
801572	803393	No, it was just the card and the black sleeve.
803413	805494	When I bought mine, I paid $10 and I got it in the box.
806335	808696	But I got her an original cartridge of Guardian Legends, so that made me happy.
808736	809437	Completely unopened.
810557	811058	That's nice.
811638	812539	Yeah, my Guardian Legend.
813399	814880	I opened it to play it, of course.
815961	816381	There you go.
817522	819063	So yeah, I got her a copy of Guardian Legend.
819103	822265	I should have just took it home with me, but I don't have an old school Nintendo here.
822385	825347	I'm holding out hope they will put it on Virtual Console eventually.
825627	825747	What?
826283	828425	Who do you know in this room who has five Nintendos?
828845	829786	Are you going to give me one?
830767	831668	Probably, I could.
831688	832188	Sweet!
832508	833089	Let me talk to Dan.
833529	836272	Then maybe I'm going to send Amanda back to that store and get me more games.
836292	837473	Just buy a Generation Next.
838233	840015	Oh, yeah, we'll talk about that later in the show.
840035	841576	There's this other thing coming out I'll talk about later.
841596	842377	Well, no, it's already out.
842897	843958	Well, isn't it on the show roll?
844198	844278	No.
844319	845920	No, this is something else.
845940	847802	This is the thing we saw at E3 like a few years back.
847842	848582	Oh, that thing!
849363	850784	The $20 console thing.
850804	851084	$60, yeah.
851104	851084	$60?
851124	851805	$60 bucks.
853439	855500	I thought they were only charging people $20 or was that just at the show?
855580	856221	That was at the show.
856241	856561	Oh, I see.
856621	857621	Should have bought it at the show.
857641	858422	I know, damn it.
858942	859162	Oh, well.
860003	863524	Anyhow, so yeah, obviously there was some 8-bit gaming goodness, Dave and Busters.
864285	874751	I finally caved and I got a DS Lite, which by the way, I saw this story floating around blogs this week talking about how Nintendo World has these custom DS Lites that you can buy in all these different colors.
875171	875951	They wanted $280 for those.
877552	881394	and the picture that's floating around doesn't show you all the colors that they have.
881514	889018	I don't know if they added some or what because I distinctly remember there was a green one because that's the one I wanted to get and you don't see that one in the pictures that made it around all the different game blogs.
889338	892920	Check DJ Ranma's picture site which I'm sure he'll link in chat right now.
893000	896402	I think it's DJRanmaS.net and check out his New York City pictures.
896442	899844	He actually took a picture of the case with all the colors and some of the newer ones that were in there.
899864	902305	It was between that and the fuchsia hot pink one.
902385	906708	I don't remember what the fucking website is but there is a website out there that you can buy.
907208	932830	custom colored anything consoles $280 they wanted for that well you can buy it cheaper than that they sell iPods there they sell PSPs you know DS lights everything and you can get them in custom colors so I'm not sure about DS lights but I know they sold the original DS on this site but people just forget they can do that or just paint it I don't know take it apart and paint the damn thing
933789	947167	Alright, uh, well they also do engraving there, and I almost bought my new DS Lite at the Nintendo World Store to get it engraved, because they'll engrave your DS for only like 20 bucks, and there's all these patterns you can choose from, and I thought that was pretty awesome, but their engraving machine was broken.
947608	948329	So I didn't get to do it.
948850	950232	So, sucks to that.
950812	952733	They're engraving machines that I am error.
952914	960739	But basically, when I got to Pennsylvania, I was like, well, sales tax is lower here than it is in California.
960839	963120	I was so bored in Pennsylvania, I have to be honest.
963160	967243	No offense to those of you folks that live in the Allentown area where I was at for a few days, but...
967643	968624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
990980	995503	And you don't want your opponent, who's going to go after you, to be able to line up the skulls.
995824	1000667	Because basically, to explain the game real fast, there's the story that all goes with it.
1000967	1005350	You can cast spells, which are like special moves on the board, but to do that requires mana.
1005630	1008272	And so the stones on the board are red, yellow, blue, and green.
1008572	1013055	And then you also have gold coins, purple experience stars, and skulls.
1013355	1014736	When you line up the coins, you get gold.
1014776	1017218	When you line up the experience stars, you get experience, so you can level up.
1017598	1020360	When you line up the skulls, your opponent takes damage.
1020640	1021740	Puzzle Quest Puzzle League
1043593	1045754	to really play, to give it a fair response.
1045794	1052317	But I know it's, I played it once, and I know it's very similar, of course, to Pokemon Puzzle League, but with some new stuff.
1052557	1054298	You totally reminded me of the other game I was playing.
1054418	1054758	What's that?
1054918	1055838	Pokemans!
1056499	1057299	Oh, Pearl and Diamond?
1057399	1058219	Or what do you have, Diamond?
1058620	1058980	Oh, Pearl?
1059200	1061021	Because I'm being not like everybody else.
1061081	1061741	I have Pearl, too.
1061761	1062221	Bah!
1062241	1062902	You're being like me.
1062982	1063382	Bah!
1063422	1063822	Yourself.
1063982	1065082	No, I'm being different.
1065303	1065863	All right, that's fine.
1065983	1067283	Are you having fun with your Pokemans?
1067964	1068724	At the gym, yes.
1068944	1069464	All right, cool.
1069484	1071885	I've learned the fine art of playing Pokemans on the elliptical.
1072226	1072826	That's a good idea.
1074022	1074502	It's very hard.
1103502	1104283	XBOX Live Arcades in an Arcade
1126283	1126983	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1148112	1151115	What is up with Namco and the rave-y soundtrack games?
1151395	1153777	Namco made that Flaming Finger game at Dave & Buster's.
1154017	1155498	They made the Jumpin' Jackpot game.
1156139	1157420	There's rave whores that work.
1158261	1160102	They're all on Ecstasy over there or something.
1160683	1161163	So, whatever.
1162024	1166407	Pac-Man Championship Edition and also I played Prince of Persia Classic.
1167008	1168109	The game looks beautiful.
1168329	1169630	I mean, the way they redid the graphics.
1169650	1170411	That's the best...
1171724	1172945	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1197646	1204352	Checking out the chat room, www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Click on chat or you can go directly to chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com We tape live on Sunday nights.
1205473	1205873	Let's see.
1206854	1210797	BlackDevilerX agrees with Loki's I want to see Xbox Live Arcade in an arcade.
1211078	1211818	I think it'd be cool.
1212078	1212479	They should.
1212999	1215180	TheRobD says, I hate Flaming Finger.
1215700	1218661	And JVmon says, Flaming Finger told Sky to get his flame on.
1218681	1219061	That's right.
1219101	1222022	You know, the game said, when you start the game, have you played Flaming Finger at Dave & Buster's?
1222382	1223222	I watched you play it.
1223963	1226523	You know, and when you start it, you're playing footsie with my hand.
1227604	1231085	Whenever you put your money in the game, whatever it says, get your flame on.
1232165	1233045	Which is really funny.
1233726	1236406	Because I'm gay, and you know, they say flaming or whatever.
1237207	1237907	Anyway, let's see.
1237987	1239928	Looking at what else is going on in chat room.
1241028	1241208	Um...
1242495	1246138	Gerardimo says, Pokemon Puzzle League sucked because it had no Yoshi.
1247119	1249021	Making a reference to the old school Tetris Attack.
1249882	1251423	GS68 points out there's a Ms.
1251463	1255147	Pac-Man machine at Miggle, Milpitas Golf Land, a very infamous arcade here in California.
1255968	1258290	Blackboy says, I think I need the Fuchsia DS Lite.
1260152	1262574	So that's almost a flaming DS Lite right there, so.
1263354	1266901	Alright, well that sounds like it's about it for our gaming weeks.
1267122	1269827	So let's get into some housekeeping real, real quick.
1270449	1273735	And then we're going to get into tonight's gaming news.
1274850	1275991	Not a whole lot of housekeeping.
1300012	1304054	A happy 100th episode to Bobby, because he had his 100th episode tonight.
1304355	1307196	So congrats to Bobby Blackwolf, our friend over at AllGames.com.
1307216	1316081	Speaking of AllGames.com, you can always hear the rebroadcast of our program over there Monday nights at 5.30 Pacific Standard Time.
1316522	1317602	They replay our show.
1317642	1323706	It's A and B back-to-back, so sometimes you have to wait for Part B on the podcast or audio blog feed for a little while.
1323946	1326587	They replay it over there Monday nights and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.
1326607	1327468	Pacific Standard Time.
1328257	1329958	Let's get into some gaming news.
1330038	1334061	We obviously missed a week last week, so Loki, tell us about what we missed.
1335762	1336782	Well, some stuff.
1337323	1344347	I guess the Halo 3 beta ended, so everybody's sad because they have to wait for the Halo 3 actual game to come out.
1345007	1346789	But, you know, hey, whatever.
1346949	1347909	They got a good turnout.
1348229	1352372	Apparently, Bungie was saying that they've clocked so many hours of Halo 3 that they could have
1352833	1362502	If they were to create, I guess, one-on-one games using the same amount of time in that beta, they would have 700 years worth of gameplay, so... Go analysts!
1363243	1366386	Anyways, other rumors... I played it twice.
1367286	1368127	I played it once.
1368307	1368868	I beat you.
1370589	1376955	So, Parappa 3, rumored to be coming to the PS3, and this, of course, is coming from EGM.
1378476	1380698	No other information on that other than it's rumored.
1380838	1382779	I think that's kind of saying, like, duh.
1384200	1385701	Prince of Persia, the movie.
1386022	1388884	It's going to be coming out July 10th, 2009.
1389344	1393007	Everybody is excited because it's going to be very Pirates of the Caribbean-like.
1393767	1394668	So, hurrah.
1397330	1406997	Another updated or upgraded graphic version of Metal Gear Solid 4's Tokyo Game Show trailer has made it online with a little interesting...
1408863	1410184	Bit that's missing towards the end.
1410744	1416027	Some people will notice that the PlayStation 3 logo is missing at the very end of the trailer.
1416047	1416267	Oh, fuck.
1416307	1417148	Here we go again.
1417468	1418168	It's coming to 360!
1418308	1420589	I swear to God, this game's coming to 360!
1421230	1423151	This game is coming to the 360!
1423191	1424351	Why aren't you people listening to me?
1425032	1425812	Oh my God.
1427273	1428594	People are going crazy.
1430095	1430415	Anyways.
1430655	1431235	Shut up!
1431655	1434517	When they're ready to announce it on the 360, they will announce it.
1434577	1437879	And yes, they probably will, but keep your pants on in the meantime.
1437939	1438239	God.
1439123	1445027	And next being announced, coming to film, ultra-generic video game movie 4.
1445508	1450991	In other words, City of Heroes is going to be adapted to film and TV.
1451592	1456835	Because, I don't know, it's just a parody of all the other superhero things out there.
1457015	1459817	Sure, generic superhero movie, that would be awesome.
1461218	1463540	Then, Mrs. Coming to the DS, hurrah!
1465294	1466815	Lego MMO coming in 2008.
1466875	1468836	That's awesome.
1469216	1471016	Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition.
1471036	1473577	Because, you know, Tomb Raider is so fucking awesome.
1473657	1474077	Woohoo.
1474818	1477719	It's actually coming to the 360, possibly as download content.
1477739	1481400	This is coming from readings found on the ESRB's website.
1481840	1485742	And people are thinking that's going to be download content, possibly for Tomb Raider Legends.
1486722	1486982	Don't care.
1487935	1498319	and Pac-Man Championship Edition was released for the 360 and I guess it's the first actual sequel to Pac-Man, although I do remember there's like Pac-Man... Oh, what?
1498459	1498740	Ms.
1498800	1501261	Pac-Man, Junior Pac-Man... Oh, no!
1501301	1501861	Pac-Man!
1501941	1502661	No, no, no, no!
1502881	1504742	Those did not have different levels!
1504782	1507763	Pac-Mania... No, no, wait, wait.
1508003	1511745	Pac-Man Junior, though, was admittedly harder because it had the scrolling screen.
1513328	1515131	and it just kind of sucked, generally.
1515351	1517874	But Super Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man was awesome.
1517894	1519676	Yo, what the fuck about Super Pac-Man?
1519696	1521819	That game was completely different than Pac-Man.
1522139	1524783	Listen, it's new, okay?
1525263	1525964	Sorry.
1526064	1528888	This is coming from the people that know Pac-Man, the people that made it.
1529088	1531652	Look, this is the first Pac-Man with raving.
1531773	1532474	I'll give it that.
1532514	1535338	This is the first rave-alicious Pac-Man game.
1535418	1536080	That's what it's got.
1536100	1536280	Whatever.
1536340	1536821	Guess what?
1536861	1538403	You fucking bought Pac-Man again.
1538624	1540266	You suck, you stupid bastard.
1540286	1540687	Sucker.
1540707	1541228	And guess what?
1541248	1543432	Nintendo has another fucking Game Boy to throw at you, too.
1544454	1545274	Dumbass fuck.
1545634	1547755	Anyway, so, yeah, it came out.
1547835	1548275	Hooray.
1548355	1548875	Ten bucks.
1549035	1549695	I didn't buy it.
1550635	1551095	I did.
1551315	1551535	You did.
1551555	1552496	I'm taking my head in shame.
1552856	1555076	A lot of people on my friends list did, dude.
1555256	1556136	A lot of people bought it.
1556156	1556697	Guess what?
1556757	1560077	And then when the next Namco fucking collection comes out, there'll be Pac-Man in that, too.
1561498	1563898	And when the next console comes out, there'll be another Pac-Man game.
1564478	1566279	Because people buy Pac-Man.
1566359	1567339	You're sighing, Jamie.
1567379	1568159	Why are you sighing?
1568934	1569455	and DarkSakura.com.
1592324	1593765	Did you not play Pac-Man World?
1593785	1596227	No, it'd be like the Pac-Man family from the cartoon.
1596707	1598889	Oh yeah, and there was that side-scrolling Pac-Man game.
1598989	1601891	Remember at Glass Gaming Expo, I bought that.
1602591	1603092	You did?
1603832	1605053	I bought it for the TurboGrafx.
1605153	1605953	You sucker!
1607054	1608876	But it was the only copy that I have.
1610517	1612878	Okay, well that makes it all... It's Pac-Land!
1614520	1615160	It was Pac-Land.
1615180	1616501	I remember playing Pac-Land.
1616521	1617541	I'm like, oh, Pac-Land.
1617561	1619942	This is going to be interesting because it's not Pac-Man.
1619982	1620722	It's Pac-Land.
1621042	1621342	I played it.
1621362	1622202	I'm like, wow, this sucks.
1623543	1624303	Stupid MAME.
1624523	1627044	Making me play crappy games because I don't know what they are.
1627484	1629264	And then you went back to Miss World 96 Nude.
1629505	1629745	No.
1630745	1634126	If ever you want the ultimate MAME experience, you just play Blazing Star.
1635565	1640772	I have to introduce our special guest tonight who came in a little bit late there while Loki was doing his story.
1640992	1642534	But this is your first time in the studio, right?
1643115	1645338	I think the last time I went here was in...
1645973	1647654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1674125	1674846	I'll be there.
1675086	1676067	I'll be cosplaying.
1676148	1677669	Sexy Nojuku Iruga.
1691695	1698940	I know where people are going to know you from, Explicit, is your cosplay from Fanime this year, which is actually when I told you.
1698960	1700080	That was the greatest ever.
1700100	1702822	Because when I ran into you, I said, you need to come back on the show.
1702902	1704343	Tell them what you cosplayed as.
1704383	1705143	It was awesome.
1706784	1711387	For those who did not go to FanimeCon, I was the one who dressed up as the Wiimote.
1713160	1716861	We saw you walking by when we were heading back to the hotel room.
1716881	1718301	We're like, dude, is that a Wiimote?
1718761	1721422	And I think I said to somebody, I'm like, that's explicit.
1721482	1722982	Remember him when he used to come on the show?
1723002	1723442	We weren't there.
1723663	1724223	I was walking.
1724723	1725303	I was with somebody.
1725323	1726223	It might have been Ranma or somebody.
1726243	1727143	I was like, that's explicit.
1727503	1728304	Oh, was it you, Matt?
1728344	1728844	Maybe that's it.
1729184	1729424	All right.
1729484	1730064	That's what it was.
1730484	1730704	All right.
1730744	1732285	But anyway, so now you're back.
1732385	1736826	And so we were able to exchange numbers and everything, get you back here on the program to give some more FUs.
1737126	1738586	So feel free to chime in throughout the night.
1738766	1740607	What kind of games have you been playing recently?
1741247	1741907	Any Wii games?
1742697	1744618	Well, instead of a Wii, yep, WarioWare.
1744638	1747479	I was actually trying to get someone to play drunk WarioWare on that.
1748139	1749940	Hmm, there's an idea for the fifth anniversary.
1751221	1751521	Alright.
1751981	1756303	And let's, yeah, um, let's see, I've been playing Planet Puzzle League lately.
1756723	1760125	Since I've been trying to get, trying to master all these puzzle games lately.
1760905	1761465	What do you think of it?
1761986	1764087	It was actually pretty difficult just to master itself.
1764947	1769009	It's a lot easier, a lot harder than like Tetris or Luminous in which...
1770245	1771666	I bought it, but I've only played it once.
1772626	1776107	Yeah, but I've just seen that insane video that someone sent me a while ago.
1776187	1777968	It was like 33x combo.
1778889	1779249	Dang.
1779649	1779909	Yeah.
1780129	1781049	Is that on YouTube somewhere?
1781490	1782450	Yeah, it's on YouTube somewhere.
1783110	1784331	Have you played Puzzle Quest?
1784351	1785811	Because I was raving about that earlier in the show.
1785891	1786792	Puzzle Quest is great.
1786992	1787932	I have not played that yet.
1788572	1791854	If you like role-playing games, you like puzzle games, they made this game for you.
1792354	1794695	Seriously, they put a little bow on it and said, here, here it is.
1795435	1795836	Just for you.
1796196	1798697	For DS, PSP, and supposedly Xbox Live Arcade.
1798937	1801518	I remember us doing a story that it's coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
1801799	1804080	But seriously, just get the DS or PSP.
1804200	1807302	Actually, I have a friend that says the PSP version looks a lot better.
1807602	1808762	I haven't seen it myself yet.
1808802	1809943	I'm content with the DS one.
1810303	1811944	We'll see what happens.
1811964	1812524	Pick your poison.
1812964	1813185	All right.
1813225	1815006	Anyway, so Explicit, ladies and gentlemen, is here.
1815106	1817287	So feel free to chime in whenever you like.
1817807	1819628	But we need to get to this week's news.
1819828	1823330	So Loki, if you wouldn't mind starting us off with a little piece of the news from this week.
1823911	1825152	Yes, a piece of the news.
1825653	1835801	And of course, you know, if you've been listening to all games, you've probably heard about it, but Sony has officially announced the agency for PC and the PS3.
1836702	1839244	It's going to be a brand new spy-themed MMO.
1839785	1842748	Not exactly like Spy vs. Spy, but still pretty awesome.
1843448	1845690	And, yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.
1846050	1847692	And, I don't know.
1848252	1848993	Is it, Loki?
1849654	1849954	Is it?
1850672	1851513	Going to be cool.
1851833	1852513	How do you know?
1852834	1853294	How do I know?
1853474	1854815	Because the screenshots look cool.
1854835	1858317	I mean, you've got two people firing guns at a bunch of people with guns.
1858357	1860739	I mean, that's all you need is guns and people firing guns.
1860799	1862100	I mean, seriously.
1862300	1863101	No, no, no, no, no.
1863381	1864682	And he has a parachute.
1865002	1866683	Is there fire, yes or no?
1867564	1868964	There's gunfire, muzzle flash.
1869225	1869765	I don't know.
1870045	1872467	That little spot on the ground looks like it might be fire.
1873708	1876169	I'm sure it's got fire, but I don't know.
1876209	1876930	It looks pretty cool.
1877915	1886518	Just as long as it's not like, you know, she spies or something like that.
1887278	1888258	You are so random.
1889018	1891079	Wait, doesn't this like hook up with the PC?
1891199	1892719	Like it's like Shadowrun or something?
1892880	1894020	Like I thought I heard something about that.
1894060	1894440	It gets the hook up.
1895189	1897370	No, seriously, can't you play, like, with the PC people?
1897731	1904895	Well, it's an MMO, so I would imagine... Is it across the two platforms, or is it that they're just separate entities?
1905375	1907176	I got the impression you could play across both platforms.
1907196	1907997	I believe it's cross-platform.
1908017	1908437	Like Shadowrun.
1909018	1909918	I mean, it should.
1909958	1916682	I mean, the PS3's fucking supposedly powerful enough to run this shit, so, I mean, why couldn't they do cross-platform?
1917142	1917763	I would think it is.
1918323	1921585	It's not like live, you know, where it's their own self-contained network.
1921665	1924727	It's Sony, do whatever, yeah.
1925302	1926523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1946266	1948467	So it's something like, you know, here's something to wait for.
1948487	1949187	It's just like Killzone 2.
1949527	1952468	Ooh, Killzone 2's coming next year.
1952628	1957289	So, I mean, great, that's awesome that it's coming next year, but we're talking now.
1957329	1961410	That's just like saying, you know, back when the 360 launched, ooh, but the PlayStation 3's coming out.
1962850	1965071	Well, goody for them, but it's not out right now.
1965231	1971973	So, you know, it's just like, you know, I'm gonna, well, I'm gonna bring my friends, they're gonna beat you up, so, meh.
1973384	1976185	Going to the chat room and looking at the comments there.
1976605	1980526	Bandit says, I'd rather play a She-Ra video game other than that.
1980846	1982987	Dude, I bet a She-Ra game would be great.
1983007	1984587	Actually, a She-Ra game would be pretty fucking badass.
1984647	1986128	It's like uber-barbarian chickly.
1987348	1989729	And hopefully the little wizard guy is hidden somewhere in it.
1990389	1993770	GS68 says, PlayStation 3, gimmicks, gimmicks, gimmicks.
1993810	1994690	That was Madam Raz.
1996511	2000512	And RawSteelUT follows that right up saying, Not as gimmicky as the Wii.
2001052	2001492	Oh, snap.
2002502	2005465	BlackDevilerX says, great, that'll give the PS3 another game.
2006646	2010088	And RossDLUT is also rolling his eyes going, ew, cross-platform.
2011029	2011149	Ew.
2012330	2016993	I heard the cross-platform so far, you know, with Shadowrun's kind of not working.
2017914	2021877	I don't want to give the definitive review on the game because I have not played it.
2021897	2024619	I'm not going to attempt to review a game based on screenshots alone.
2024739	2029963	But, word on the street around my blogs and things of that nature is that Shadowrun sucks.
2030384	2031865	And I don't know, I won't...
2032369	2041833	Well, what do you expect when you turn a really awesome role-playing game into a fucking hate multiplayer-only games out there?
2041953	2043094	That is retarded.
2043757	2046259	I don't want to play multiplayer games all the time.
2046439	2048401	Sometimes I'm in the mood for it, sometimes I'm not.
2048581	2052344	Okay, Saikun's Making Angry Face in chat says Shadowrun fucking rocks.
2052984	2058628	It rocks, but it would have rocked even more as a fucking RPG, like it should be, because it's a RPG.
2058708	2067095	That would be, you know, a game that you can do, like, from FASA or something that would be good just multiplayer only would be MechWarrior or something like that.
2067435	2067715	DarkSakura
2093584	2094484	Silent Hill 5.
2094905	2095245	Oh, yes.
2095545	2096265	You have my attention.
2096505	2097586	Might have a U.S.
2097666	2098126	developer.
2098846	2099767	But it could happen.
2099907	2100667	It could not happen.
2101748	2102328	So we don't know.
2102888	2105149	They're like, it could happen, but it could not.
2106029	2106910	So we don't know.
2107330	2108350	Again, rumor.
2108691	2110311	I fucking hate stories like that.
2110511	2114073	No offense, Jamie, because I know you're just reading what is... I didn't pick it out.
2114313	2114593	I know.
2114833	2117194	I know you're just reading what... Someone picked this like they picked their nose.
2117294	2122817	I know you're just reading what all the video game blogs are reporting on this week, which is fine, but... This is not news!
2124414	2125854	This is not news!
2126535	2128415	La la la, I could hear once.
2129375	2129775	Really?
2130016	2135237	I mean, we all know that Silent Hill 5 is coming out soon.
2136137	2145420	But to hear that it might have a developer that might be doing this with it, how is that news?
2146020	2147680	What's even better is it may or may not.
2147981	2153062	Wow, thank you for covering all sides of possibilities right there, because there were only two.
2154002	2154723	It may or may not.
2155023	2156244	It sorta does.
2156445	2161730	I mean, you can't have like... You can't have 50% on that.
2163352	2167376	They're a US developer that's right on the border of Mexico or something like that.
2167416	2168397	They're built on the border.
2168617	2171180	So half of them are Mexican, half of them are in the US.
2171460	2173002	So it's halfway true.
2173022	2176085	No, it's being done by the Hawaiian division.
2177309	2178510	No, it's not.
2179110	2180671	They all got sent out to sea, didn't you hear?
2180691	2183172	Well, no wonder why the game's not going to get finished.
2183272	2185973	It's like, since Hawaii, some guy's like, what the fuck is this?
2186893	2189294	Pyramid Headwind Snorkeling, you'll just have to deal.
2191135	2192876	Silent Hill, Extreme Beach Volleyball.
2192896	2193516	You know, if this is...
2196348	2198268	Dude, the nurses are pretty hot, actually.
2199169	2207190	You know, if this is what the news is going to be like this week, then seriously, Orange Lounge Radio has been preempted this week for the Dead or Alive movie discussion.
2208310	2210371	Boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies, boobies.
2212691	2212951	See?
2213031	2214251	Street Fighter 2 movie.
2216852	2217292	Anyhow.
2217312	2219012	That movie was all about Kylie Minogue.
2219412	2220912	That movie killed Raul Julia.
2221813	2223653	It was his last movie, that's true.
2224671	2225412	It killed him.
2225532	2228475	He could have had... Not even the life support suit could bring him back.
2228675	2235361	Plenty of more years left, and that movie's just like... He didn't even go... That's so rude!
2235521	2237383	He didn't even go Psycho Crusher once.
2237683	2239605	Didn't he have an HBO movie, actually?
2240486	2241467	Like, that didn't count.
2242327	2242908	That he won awards for.
2242928	2244109	That movie was Clint Eastwood, wasn't it?
2245407	2248929	I just bought the Addams Family on DVD right before I left for New York.
2249009	2250630	That's Raul Julia at his finest.
2251110	2252471	That's how I prefer to remember him.
2252491	2253151	Addams Family is fucking awesome.
2253451	2254572	And Addams Family values.
2256292	2262375	Oh, and then SSJ100 Matt comes up with the perfect witty retort that only our chat room can come up with.
2262916	2265837	Pyramid Head snorkels and gets taken out by a stingray barb.
2267358	2268698	That's just lovely.
2268778	2269279	Too soon.
2269319	2270239	No, no, no.
2270279	2274121	Pyramid Head would probably just poke the thing with his big pointy head.
2275353	2275713	You know what?
2276133	2277254	Seriously, I don't have to work tomorrow.
2277274	2278614	I'm going to go get some liquor, I think.
2279955	2281355	This might help me through tonight's show.
2281875	2284176	That doesn't help me through tonight's show, Bob!
2284196	2284816	You want some?
2284837	2285777	You drove, though.
2285797	2286197	You can't.
2286517	2288258	I went to go get some root beer.
2288398	2291319	You know, the nice root beer, and it fucking wasn't there.
2291339	2292559	Nice root beer!
2293060	2293480	No, not that.
2293500	2294220	That's diet shit.
2294580	2295520	Diet is never nice.
2296301	2298822	So, all they have is fucking vanilla cream.
2298862	2299922	I fucking hate cream soda!
2300222	2300642	I hate it!
2301343	2302363	Hate it, hate it, hate it!
2304025	2306527	Was there a video game show here once, or was it just me?
2307568	2308129	Root Beer Tapper.
2308149	2309270	See, it ties in.
2311852	2313754	I am not deviating from the show's plan.
2314034	2316957	I am talking about video games, or at least one step into video games.
2317678	2320300	Alright, I'm going to read this story so I can go get some booze.
2320901	2321381	Here it is.
2321882	2322282	Let's see.
2324064	2327667	Oh, this is actually... This is real news, actually.
2328087	2328548	Sony...
2329238	2332310	finally got themselves an official blog.
2333013	2334981	Let's give Sony a round of applause.
2336991	2341053	Congratulations, Sony, you finally caught on and you got yourselves a blog.
2341093	2346096	You finally figured out, hey, maybe that Major Nelson, he seems to stay in touch with the community pretty good.
2346196	2348277	Xbox 360 seems to know what they're doing with the community.
2348297	2352099	Nintendo, they have Reggie, very likable, very personable guy.
2352399	2353799	Ken Kutaragi, crayon eater.
2354320	2355800	So what can we do?
2355840	2357221	So they finally launched a blog.
2357281	2358082	Good job, Sony.
2358482	2362364	And you can read it for yourself, blog.us.playstation.com.
2363124	2370869	and, uh, at least this one's not faking the blee, you know, the be a, like an independent blog, like, was it that all I want for Christmas is a PSP shit?
2370909	2372910	Yeah, this is actually fairly well done.
2373070	2375771	I mean, this is really what I think folks have been asking for.
2376092	2378253	There's some articles here, they're, they're pretty honest.
2378893	2386616	This guy who is the US producer for Motorstorm is talking about the patch and how the 1.2 is going to have this time attack mode.
2386836	2389017	And then talking about how there's a bug in the game.
2389497	2392338	There was another post that was talking about the PS3 firmware update 1.81.
2393218	2398460	And they kind of have like a buffet of people, so to speak, writing for it.
2398540	2399741	And it's actually not bad.
2400301	2401581	So good job, Sony.
2401601	2405843	You're a little late in getting here, but I guess it was worth waiting for.
2405863	2405943	Yeah.
2406769	2407069	Fair enough.
2407089	2407950	Better late than never.
2408010	2409111	I guess, that's very true.
2409131	2410332	There you have it.
2424352	2431315	This is probably no thanks to the fact that the PlayStation 3 software development kit got leaked a couple weeks ago out on the internet.
2431375	2433296	So, yeah, that only helps things along.
2433676	2448062	But they've started with actually allowing... Apparently, versions 1.1 and 1.11 of the PS3 firmwares can now access, I guess, burnt game ISOs where you can...
2450851	2451771	But it won't play them yet.
2451891	2461933	So I guess that's the first step in getting backwards compatibility with some burn games or possibly, I don't know, Piracy.
2462254	2463414	Lots of pirated games.
2463854	2464454	Or Homebrew.
2465174	2470715	But right now, nothing's coming of it, but they're working on it.
2471316	2475116	But Sony has this to say about it.
2475676	2477217	They don't like the fact that people want to...
2478683	2479704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2494031	2496012	I don't think anyone's going to try to run an old Sega CD game.
2496092	2496192	Ever.
2496212	2496532	I would.
2496592	2498434	But then again, I have old Sega CD games.
2519899	2524841	They claim that they're serious, which means that they're in serious trouble.
2524861	2528082	They're not going to be able to do crap.
2528202	2534384	If the PS3 is so easy to crack this long, how many fucking updates have there been to the damn firmware?
2534984	2537725	I mean, it's only a matter of time before they crack it.
2539285	2545507	If you're not interested in going online and stuff, I would recommend keeping your firmware as low as possible.
2546947	2548868	If you're interested in that piracy stuff.
2549403	2552364	As far as Homebrew, though, I mean, hello, you can install Linux on it.
2552625	2558307	I mean, if you want to play old SNES games, you can fucking put it on Yellow Dog Linux.
2558447	2560909	So, who cares?
2562249	2562569	Yay.
2562890	2564290	Well, I have better news than that.
2565451	2567372	This is happy news, because I love the 80s.
2569107	2573669	Guitar Hero Encore has more tracks listed, which is like super happy.
2573909	2579611	So we have Hold On Loosely that was, well, all of these, but like one that I'm going to name was a cover.
2579691	2582492	So the one that's not a cover is The Warrior by Scandal.
2584013	2595818	Now the covers are Hold On Loosely from 38 Special, No One Like You by The Scorpions, Only a Lad, Oingo Boingo, it's a cool song, Radar Love by White Lion, Ballroom Blitz by Crocus, a great name.
2596644	2597884	Dude, Ballroom Blitz is awesome.
2597944	2598765	I know, I like this song.
2598805	2599845	I just always laugh at the band's name.
2600645	2605007	What I Like About You by The Romantics and Rough Child by Iron Maiden because Iron Maiden's fucking awesome.
2606027	2613650	And others on the list, 18 and Life, Bathroom Wall, Lonely is the Night, Nothing But a Good Time.
2613670	2616111	Dude, Poison, Play With Me, Shaken.
2616551	2618872	Dude, I love Eddie, but it's like my favorite Eddie Money song ever.
2619932	2624894	Synchronicity 2, I Wanna Rock, I Ran, of course, The Black Seagulls.
2625589	2627750	It's the actual song too, so is the Twisted Sister one.
2628611	2635955	Round and Round, I Want Candy, Metal Health, Holy Diver, and Heat of the Moment.
2638157	2639838	Are you excited about Guitar Heroes Rock Series?
2639858	2640378	Hell yeah!
2641539	2642639	I love my 80s rock.
2643940	2648563	So I went to go make some liquor, and I don't have a lot to pick from because I didn't stock up before tonight's show.
2649395	2650956	I mixed Malibu rum and root beer.
2650996	2652176	How do you think that's going to turn out?
2652196	2652477	Give me.
2652917	2653737	Wait, I haven't tried it yet.
2653797	2654518	You want to try it first?
2654638	2655378	I'll be your sample.
2655458	2656178	All right, try that.
2656238	2657779	Don't spill it on your laptop, for God's sake.
2661181	2662061	That's some bizarre shit.
2662081	2663742	It tastes like Dr. Pepper, which is nasty.
2663922	2664162	Really?
2664222	2666864	Everything tastes like Dr. Pepper when you mix it with alcohol.
2667084	2667704	Let me try this.
2670854	2672415	It kind of does taste like Dr. Pepper.
2672455	2673356	It's not too bad.
2673756	2676398	Well, I hate Dr. Pepper, so I'm finishing off my root beer.
2676418	2678240	Dr. Pepper is just a combination of everything.
2678480	2680862	You want to know what's still in my fridge, by the way, Rob?
2680962	2681202	Huh?
2681462	2683404	The bottle of pineapple Malibu from Fatime.
2683484	2684004	Delicious.
2685005	2687447	BlackDevilerX wants to know, Sky, what kind of root beer?
2687487	2689929	It's Diet IBC.
2690409	2693572	All right, so I mixed it with Malibu because that's all I had.
2694392	2697455	I had that and citrus vodka, and I knew that would be really bad.
2697475	2698776	You should mix the vodka and the Malibu.
2699617	2700238	We'll see, we'll see.
2700698	2702000	Drink that like a shot.
2702060	2703501	Can I do a video game story, please?
2703721	2703882	No.
2704342	2704562	Okay.
2704782	2705823	All right.
2705904	2708746	Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the PlayStation 3.
2709287	2715033	Not that you may have heard that somewhere before, or it was soon after Retracted, but we can officially...
2715553	2722176	With permission, tell you now, that Time Crisis 4 is coming out to the PlayStation 3 with a GunCon controller.
2722276	2730579	And of course, Famitsu, they were the first to break this news about Time Crisis 4 coming to the PlayStation 3.
2730899	2732500	You hadn't heard it anywhere before then.
2733540	2740141	The PlayStation 3 version will have an arcade mode, and it's just going to be just like the arcade game, which is pretty awesome.
2741381	2744302	So if you like Time Crisis, you're going to be really excited about this game, I'm sure.
2744342	2748063	There is a GunCon controller that's coming out with this, which is kind of ugly.
2748163	2750063	It's orange and kind of looks like the Zapper.
2750423	2752163	Not as ugly as the dude holding it.
2752223	2753603	Dude, that guy is fugly.
2753623	2754364	You know what's cool, though?
2754384	2754744	What?
2754804	2758364	I was reading that they're going to have first-person shooter portions of the game.
2759244	2761645	That's why the GunCon is so weird-looking.
2761805	2762525	That's kind of cool, though.
2762945	2785349	and apparently they're going to have it functions like the Wii you put these things on the left or right side of your TV kind of like how on the Wii you have the LED bar and then there's a camera inside the actual gun and that determines where the markers are at so that means that way you can use the gun con whether you have an LCD a plasma whatever it'll work on any type of TV which is good news what's kind of neat though and I mean
2787132	2788413	GunCon games are out there.
2788433	2789533	I mean, really not that many.
2789933	2799777	I think that this would be awesome for first-person shooters because you've got, basically, on the front grip of the gun, you have kind of the second half of a PlayStation controller.
2800157	2806659	You've got your own analog stick and two shoulder buttons, and then on the back of the gun, there's another analog stick right by the trigger.
2807219	2815102	So, in a sense, this would be the perfect solution for, you know, gun games or first-person shooters.
2815472	2816093	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2839605	2840926	I guess so, sure.
2841466	2842087	Sure, you got it.
2842247	2843088	Upgraded Duck Hunt.
2843268	2844369	Duck Hunt 2, coming out.
2844469	2856057	Funny story, I heard that, I'm not sure about Duck Hunt, but I heard that some old NES Zapper games, you could actually get perfect scores by aiming the light gun at a light and just keep shooting at the light.
2856377	2858519	Or put a magnifying glass in front of the light gun.
2858759	2859419	That's the other trick.
2861541	2862261	Works like a charm.
2863482	2864403	Anyhow, so there it is.
2864503	2868025	GunCon Time Crisis 3, coming to the PlayStation 3 very soon.
2868366	2868646	Awesome.
2869342	2873345	and another thing that was announced for PlayStation... Wake me up when they have point blank, that's all I have to say.
2873525	2873705	Sorry.
2873805	2874426	That would be awesome.
2874746	2883953	For PlayStation 3 and for the 360, Soul Calibur 4, because we knew that Soul Calibur Legends couldn't be possibly the only game coming out.
2884493	2886514	Soul Calibur 4 will be coming out.
2887235	2891018	They claim that's going to be 60 frames per second.
2891518	2895281	I read somewhere 90 frames per second, which would be stupid, but...
2897203	2903029	And then also that it's going to possibly be 1080p.
2904070	2911557	The other thing, apparently, everybody's been talking about certain characters getting boob upgrades in the game.
2911657	2913179	It's just a fucking game, folks.
2913699	2920446	But the teaser video that they had for it didn't really reveal too much because it was just still shots, so...
2921840	2931831	Well, I'm just glad, you know, I know most games we joke about are obvious that they're coming, like Silent Hill 5, Final Fantasy 14 someday, you know, and all these other series.
2932491	2939819	I wasn't 100% for sure that there was going to be another Soul Calibur game, because I got sworn they said with this last one, that's it, kids.
2939959	2942442	And then the fact that, you know, the arcade release came later.
2943723	2951567	There was a comment on Sony's website saying that Soul Calibur 3 was exclusive for PS2 and any future Soul Calibur games.
2952107	2956850	I was wondering, what's the decision, what happened with the decision with Soul Calibur 4 being multi-console now?
2958070	2964654	Well, you see what happened is that Microsoft actually sold consoles, so that's why the decision was made to go multi-platform, I guess.
2964734	2967115	It could be the 4 million console leave that they have.
2967435	2972678	Or there's this whole rumor thing, I mean, because Sony or the fanboys are writing the hate mail right now, but also look at this, is that
2973078	2982107	Namco, and you know, you'll see this throughout some other stories you may hear tonight or may not, is that Namco and Microsoft are starting to be in bed together, you might notice.
2982267	2994660	I mean, seriously, if you look at some of the decisions they've made recently and some of the things, I mean, not that they've abandoned PlayStation 3, but look at like, you know, Ace Combat and some of these other things, you know, Namco's kind of, you know...
2995518	2996419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3018953	3020074	with the Dreamcast thing.
3020194	3021474	With the Dreamcast fishing rod.
3021875	3022355	Rod caliber.
3022375	3024296	You just told that story like last time we had a show.
3024316	3028558	I know, but every time I think of Soul Calibur, I think of Rod Calibur and how great it is.
3029398	3029859	Fair enough.
3030159	3032520	We need a new fishing controller for more Rod Calibur fun.
3032840	3035141	I think about Ivy and how great she is.
3035161	3044326	I think about trying to play Soul Calibur on the DDR pad on Dreamcast and the only analog button was like the Konami logo.
3045627	3047968	You're tapping your fingers like you want to say something, Loki.
3048467	3050191	I'm not tapping my fingers because I want to sing.
3050211	3051313	He has a nervous twitch.
3052616	3053819	It's because I'm on my third Pepsi.
3055345	3056045	Don't drink by yourself.
3056125	3057606	And don't drink lots of water.
3083440	3085382	Yes, and please don't drink lots of water and not pee.
3085422	3088864	And don't sit on the ground drinking nothing but, what, vodka and orange juice?
3089104	3089544	Alright, there.
3089745	3090665	There's your disclaimer.
3091166	3091826	Back to news.
3093187	3094128	Anything else on Soul Calibur?
3094288	3094508	Sorry.
3095328	3095629	Oh, yes.
3096049	3096409	Explicit.
3097390	3099071	Wait, the Rod Calibur?
3099091	3102553	I mean, the DDR pad on Soul Calibur.
3103374	3104014	It doesn't work.
3104775	3109198	It's almost as bizarre as someone trying to perform Shoryuken on a Street Fighter with the DDR pad.
3109218	3109958	Seen it happen.
3110018	3110599	Seen it done.
3112096	3117378	It actually is much easier to do that with the DDR pad.
3118619	3121220	I'm going to try some of those Xbox Live Arcade games I didn't like.
3121260	3124062	I'm going to try Nova Drone with the DDR pad and see if it's more fun.
3125103	3125283	No.
3126783	3127104	Maybe.
3127464	3127584	No.
3127804	3128084	Maybe.
3128464	3130005	Maybe if I drink a few more it'll be fine.
3131266	3132166	Alright.
3134308	3137869	I have an excellent idea for some of these crappy games out there.
3138590	3139991	And it's an excellent idea for...
3141283	3141523	No.
3142364	3142984	Skeet shooting?
3144785	3146426	For the ultimate endurance test.
3146466	3147087	Let me put it that way.
3147187	3147507	Okay.
3147587	3150749	DJ Janai's in chat and says, all video games are shit.
3150789	3151790	Play with a jump rope.
3153131	3154872	You might be listening to the wrong show, buddy.
3155272	3156133	I don't know what to tell you.
3158314	3160516	Well, you know, Microsoft would say jump in, so...
3161664	3168291	HitStun says you can kind of play Street Fighter on a 2DX controller.
3168572	3171215	You just can't go left.
3171815	3172236	Oh, well.
3173838	3175019	So just be player one?
3175299	3180705	I guess so, and hope that player two never thinks to jump over you or else you're fucked.
3180745	3182067	I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.
3182708	3182988	Anyway.
3184482	3203626	For those who are keeping up with the PS1 games that were to be coming out on the PSN, PlayStation Store, or whatever the hell they're calling it, we have Crash Bandicoot, Wipeout, Medieval, Jumping Flash, and Syphon Filter that will be available on, looks like next Friday.
3203786	3206607	Actually, no, is it this Friday?
3207227	3208307	No, take that back, next Friday, sorry.
3209696	3214517	They will be available for PS3 and PSP, but you can only buy them from the PS3 store.
3216337	3217538	I'm guessing that's for the UK.
3217558	3218258	For the UK, yes.
3218298	3218618	I'm sorry.
3218658	3219138	My apologies.
3219818	3226739	Also going to be available is on 22nd June, there will be Calling All Cars and Super Stardust HD on June 29th.
3226839	3228960	I heard Calling All Cars sucks.
3230780	3231580	Take that, Dave Jeff.
3231920	3237021	Well, I don't like to say that anything sucks until I've actually either seen it in play or have played it myself.
3239019	3240759	No, I think I'm going to pass judgment before I play it.
3242280	3244020	I know, I actually do that a lot, actually.
3244600	3245540	Sometimes I'm wrong.
3246100	3248401	I wrote off Halo.
3248481	3250061	I was like, I will never like that game.
3250421	3252521	I haven't liked a first-person shooter since Quake.
3252821	3253682	Halo's going to suck.
3253742	3258202	And then I actually played it at, get this, my friend's wedding reception.
3258482	3260503	They had a Halo-themed wedding reception.
3260663	3261323	That's brilliant.
3261343	3264043	And they had TVs all land together and played Halo.
3264063	3265824	They actually had a cake with Master Chief on it.
3266344	3268224	And that was the first time I ever played Halo, and I had a blast.
3269230	3273738	You can't always judge by looking, but some of the time you can.
3274880	3275922	Some of the time you really can.
3275962	3277304	I already know why I can't play Halo.
3277825	3278867	Because of the motion sickness thing?
3278887	3279067	Yep.
3279368	3279829	Sorry to hear it.
3281277	3281717	XBOX 360 SAINTS ROW
3301847	3329911	Shadowrun also coming out in Japan and some other games coming to the Asian region such as Vampire Reign also I want to point out Def Jam Icon also comes out from EA on the Xbox 360 all on June 21st also coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 21st is Hajime no Ippo Revolution which looks to be another type of anime based video game oh no it's a sports title it's a boxing title yeah it's actually what it is so first
3330131	3330551	Something.
3330751	3331231	Kind of cool.
3351937	3352698	Super Combo
3374847	3380170	That's F-U-U-U-N Super Combo.
3380470	3385593	This actually just looks like a Neo Geo compilation of some of the games there that SNK put out previously.
3385753	3387314	I bet they're pretty fun!
3387334	3388594	I bet they are fun!
3388834	3390816	It won't be fun unless Psycho Soldier is one of them.
3392356	3394878	Lots and lots of SNK loving this week in Japan, by the way.
3394898	3397379	There's also a King of Fighters thing coming out, too.
3398320	3400601	However, if you're on the DS...
3401431	3402751	Have I Got News For You.
3403111	3404932	This could be the game of the year right here.
3405352	3408213	Hello Kitty, No Gatuchi Collection.
3408613	3411533	Koi No Doki Doki Trouble is coming out.
3412293	3416714	And the box is beautifully pink with Hello Kitty wearing a bunny suit.
3417055	3418775	I think she's confused.
3418855	3420615	No, this is made by Rocket Company, not SNK.
3420675	3422996	And that's on the Nintendo DS.
3424358	3424979	Capcom vs. SNK Cardfighter
3454261	3456103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3481633	3483154	PlayStation 2, The Adventures of Darwin
3510975	3518922	On Xbox 360, we have Dirt coming out, which is an awesome off-road racing game, so definitely check that out.
3518962	3525948	PSP, PQ2, remember those old IQ games, this one should be pretty cool.
3526889	3532254	Hot Brain is going to be coming out on the PSP, another brain training sim.
3532714	3533395	Puzzlescape,
3533925	3535766	Another puzzle game.
3535906	3537686	Dungeon Maker, Hunting Ground.
3538247	3541468	Very interesting role-playing game with a little bit of sim aspects in there.
3542148	3543408	That's going to be coming out as well.
3544629	3548350	On PlayStation 3, you got a big, fat nothing.
3548770	3553032	Rainbow Six Vegas was going to be coming out this week, but once again, it's been delayed yet another week.
3554893	3555453	Let's see.
3555533	3561035	The Wii, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition is going to be making its way out, so that's going to be pretty cool.
3561972	3567964	and the DS, Time Ace, which is that Konami game that we played that's, I guess, sequel to Time Pilot.
3568225	3569728	I was the only one that kind of pointed that out.
3569848	3573235	But, um, Zen Goku, or Zen Doku is going to be coming out.
3573275	3573756	Yet another...
3574249	3578753	Cidoku Game, SimCity DS, Rob, possibly a game that you might want to pick up?
3579093	3579714	Maybe, maybe.
3580515	3584518	I still have World of Warcraft to worry about on top of all the other new crap I've got.
3584598	3585559	So, I don't know.
3585599	3586820	Too many games, too many games.
3586860	3587821	It's not even Christmas yet.
3588341	3591744	The Transformers game is coming out a little bit early for the DS.
3592085	3596428	You have both the Autobots and Decepticons games going to be heading your way.
3596709	3599031	So there is more than meets the eye to these games.
3599051	3599251	Yes.
3599631	3604214	And then finally on PC, Dirt is also coming out as well as the Hitman Trilogy.
3606715	3615000	They're actually putting out, yet again, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, and The Sims Pet Stories will be making its way out.
3616348	3617069	Goodie, goodie.
3617429	3622252	You know, I went to the new Fry's Electronics they built out in Roseville, which is all, you know, train themed out there.
3622272	3622932	Very train-alicious.
3622972	3623393	It's cute.
3623493	3623853	It's cute.
3623873	3624554	It's a cute store.
3625374	3631118	You know, the Sacramento Fry's is unlike any other Fry's because it doesn't have a theme, but all the other Fry's around the world have themes.
3631898	3637002	But anyway, the point is, I was looking at computer games just randomly because I was thinking about maybe buying a new computer game.
3637342	3646008	I was actually, I don't know why, I was tempted for like half a second to get the Lord of the Rings MMO, even though I know it's like, I'm like, oh, I kind of want to try it for no good reason.
3647128	3647708	But I didn't get it.
3647888	3648868	But I was looking at computer games.
3649248	3649769	Not even kidding.
3650269	3657090	One entire shelf, almost like two actually, dedicated to The Sims and all their spin-off series.
3657950	3661591	I mean, it is one of the best-selling games ever.
3661611	3664591	I wonder how many shelves are dedicated to the Tycoon series.
3665051	3665751	I don't even want to know.
3667332	3667772	So there you go.
3668352	3669632	How about some different release dates?
3669672	3670132	How about it?
3670952	3675713	For our friends in the UK, coming out on the 22nd, we have Calling All Cars, like I said earlier.
3679935	3693800	HotPixel, Hour of Victory, Kirby Mouse Attack, Mario Party 8, Metroid Prime Pinball, Monster Madness, Pac-Man Rally, Sega Presents Touch Dart, and Cosmic Family.
3694561	3696601	Metroid Prime Pinball just now?
3697342	3699122	You poor kids over in the UK.
3699162	3704184	I mean, it's not that that game was like that great, but seriously, that game came out here what, like six months ago?
3704204	3706165	They get flat out before I do.
3707071	3712336	I mean, I want flat out for the 360 so I can launch my driver through the window and into things.
3712396	3716139	They get one game early and, you know, they're bastards.
3716159	3717100	Hey, they get Tomb Raider early.
3717180	3717981	Whatever, okay.
3718001	3719182	Yay.
3719202	3721844	Are you excited about Tomb Raider?
3725367	3726228	That's what I thought.
3729230	3731272	Let's talk about gaming on the Mac, shall we?
3731332	3731653	Because...
3732873	3737575	We don't always get to talk about this, and Loki usually has a field day with this topic.
3737635	3741797	But, you know, there was a pretty big keynote done.
3741857	3742537	Sorry, I've been drinking.
3742817	3745238	There's been a keynote done by Steve Jobs.
3746059	3751741	The Worldwide Developers Conference did a keynote, and he talked about at the keynote that there are going to be... Excuse me.
3753362	3754703	That was very professional, sorry.
3754723	3758324	I don't get sneezed, but there's going to be coughing all over the Macintosh computers.
3758884	3759945	No, here's what's really going on.
3760925	3771091	They announced at the conference that Apple is going to be teaming up with EA and Electronic Arts is actually going to be putting out some of their games onto the Macs.
3771171	3776254	Command & Conquer 3, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter, and Madden & Tiger Woods 08.
3777315	3777895	So there you go.
3778936	3779676	Gaming on the Mac.
3779696	3781878	About fucking time.
3782298	3788742	Well, I think they've had some games before this, but EA is definitely stepping it up a notch on the Macintosh, so that's pretty cool.
3789535	3795216	Another thing that's being shown off as well is ID's Tech 5 engine.
3795276	3797596	It's going to be their fifth generation 3D engine.
3798397	3803858	You might remember them from such games as Quake 4, Doom 3, and all those other fun things.
3805038	3813619	Of course, they said that their new engine will also be able to run on Mac OS X. So that's good.
3813779	3818080	So you're actually going to get some pretty decent games on the Mac, finally.
3818858	3828603	And it's also, it says, not being built with Microsoft's DirectX 10, which makes sense because, you know, not everyone wants to have Vista either.
3829184	3829484	So...
3830444	3831525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3851946	3855548	Could this be like the next great engine that everybody wants to license?
3855588	3856008	Possibly.
3856268	3861190	I mean, Doom 3, the Doom 3 engine was, I mean, Quake 4 engine had a lot of things going for it.
3862531	3864692	Actually, Quake 4, I think, ran on the Doom 3 engine.
3864752	3867653	So, yeah, it could be the next big engine.
3867893	3870154	I mean, if it does things that Unreal can't.
3870615	3873396	Personally, I think Crysis is going to be fucking awesome.
3873656	3878338	That engine is going to be nuts as far as the amount of detail that's in it.
3878398	3880039	So they have a real high bar to me.
3881394	3881734	PC, PC, PC, PC, PC
3906039	3912984	Well, it looks like Capcom is going to start releasing titles through Steam.
3913664	3922850	They're going to be putting out PC versions of Lost Planet, Onimusha 3, Devil May Cry 3, Special Edition, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.
3923610	3926392	Can I add for matching service to that, just because I think it's funny?
3927733	3932576	Sure, but I did not know that the Puzzle Fighter game was coming to the computers.
3933137	3935298	Or did I just miss that in the initial announcement?
3936030	3936371	I guess so.
3936431	3941396	It says here that Capcom PC releases are going to be made available through Steam.
3941536	3942237	Apparently.
3942598	3943238	Well, there you go.
3943279	3944039	Well, that's pretty cool.
3944220	3948965	And I might add that their fucking Street Fighter 2 HD game looks fucking awesome.
3949426	3952149	And I think that they've set the bar pretty high for
3952978	3955599	Any new 2D fighting games coming out?
3955759	3958660	I would love to see Guilty Gear in that much detail.
3959080	3967203	It does look pretty hot, but it's going to do the same thing that Pac-Man CE did to Pac-Man on Xbox Live Arcade, is it's going to piss you off that you bought the first one.
3968723	3973145	When the Street Fighter 2 HD version comes out, it's an arcade release, right?
3973845	3974285	Yeah.
3974725	3978787	It's going to make you mad that you ever bought the Championship Edition release that came out last year.
3979507	3981908	I have every other version, why not?
3983160	3983680	I guess so.
3983941	3984441	There you have it.
3985181	3991526	Well, if you are a computer gamer, then you certainly know the series Monkey Island.
3991546	3993387	You remember this series of games, Monkey Island?
3993427	3994188	It's about pirates.
3994908	3995849	Oh, hell yeah.
3997438	3998198	Well, guess what?
3998238	4004199	Apparently, going around LucasArts is rumblings of a fifth Monkey Island game.
4004599	4006880	The fifth Monkey Island game is coming.
4007260	4014481	I know some of the guys who worked on the music compositions for the original PC Classics, and they say that it's currently being planned amidst rumors.
4014941	4019522	However, LucasArts has so many things on its belt right now, including a Wii title that is yet to be named.
4019902	4024823	Don't expect any revitalations of its classic graphic adventures until 2008 at the earliest.
4024843	4026823	That's coming from RumorReporter.com.
4027503	4030666	You know, this is a game that needs to be made into a movie.
4031847	4032747	The Monkey Island series.
4032988	4033628	It'd be awesome.
4034088	4039693	You know, with Sam and Max doing as well as it's doing critically, I mean, there's no reason why they shouldn't bring this back.
4039713	4041615	And it would be kind of interesting to see it on a console.
4041975	4044297	Although these games will always kind of be PC games to me.
4046319	4046479	Yeah.
4046679	4047339	They're pretty cool, though.
4048260	4053705	So, we talked about it a while back that, you know, Playboy was going to be coming to Second Life.
4053785	4056247	Well, they finally opened their doors in a
4056991	4058512	Fun little bunny-shaped island.
4059312	4064215	And what can you find possibly on the Playboy Island, you may ask?
4064456	4072060	Well, plenty of bunny paraphernalia from its site, playboy.com and shopthebunny.com.
4072300	4072981	Fake women.
4073881	4074622	Yes, fake women.
4075102	4082767	You'll be able to buy avatars or merchandise for your avatars and also for, you know,
4083624	4086506	Like fake bunny shirts and fake bunny ears?
4086786	4089787	Or you can buy real merchandise that can get shipped to your house.
4089827	4091068	Alright, fair enough.
4091328	4093389	So slash Playboy instead of slash pizza.
4093449	4099592	Also, they're going to have characters running around dressed up like the classic bunnies.
4100213	4101193	So that's kind of neat.
4102634	4106836	And yeah, I guess they're going to be also doing other events and stuff like that.
4107837	4108257	Events?
4109557	4110318	Pool party!
4111779	4112539	Fake pool party.
4113364	4120490	I was reading some of the comments on the story, and it was kind of funny, because they were like, I'm just going to fake bomb this place.
4120990	4123412	Well, actually, RawSteelUT read my mind in chat.
4123712	4125794	Can you throw cocks at the Playboy models?
4125974	4126795	I think you can.
4131558	4131858	Wipe.
4134100	4137162	Come on, the cock-throwing story in Second Life was funny.
4137403	4138804	So what if it was like four months old?
4138864	4139584	It's still funny.
4139985	4140405	Kinda.
4141185	4141766	There you go.
4143608	4146071	If I actually played Second Life, I would want to throw some cocks.
4146632	4148073	I mean, come on, what am I going to do?
4148414	4150496	Sit around and pretend I'm at the Playboy Mansion?
4150637	4152098	I would build the massive cock launcher.
4154281	4156143	It would be a giant cannon.
4157285	4158026	That's all it would do.
4158513	4159454	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4187549	4187989	Sucks.
4188650	4189330	I wanted to go.
4189730	4190731	We should have sent DarkSakura.
4190751	4192792	Dude, it was fucking lame.
4193052	4193392	Was it?
4193412	4194233	But it was at the Playboy Mansion.
4194273	4194813	It was lame.
4194833	4196214	But it was at the Playboy Mansion.
4196274	4201017	Dude, it's for the goddamn, was it the Professional Gaming League?
4201497	4205659	They're trying to make gaming, they're putting it on TV.
4205899	4206600	Well, why not?
4207519	4209459	I don't want to watch people play games.
4209960	4210820	I fucking hate that.
4210940	4213640	I want to play games or play games against other people.
4213940	4216201	I don't want to have people watch me play games.
4216221	4220201	So instead of watching basketball on TV, why not go play basketball?
4220601	4221061	Exactly.
4221101	4222602	It's why I don't watch sports on TV.
4222622	4223842	Well, you're just weird.
4223982	4226742	But there's a lot of people out there that do enjoy watching other people play games.
4227042	4231343	I mean, don't you have friends that will come over and sit on the couch and watch you play?
4231363	4231403	No.
4231783	4233023	They don't really want to play themselves.
4233063	4234264	They just will watch you play.
4234304	4235924	No one ever comes over to watch me play.
4236587	4238548	And Nellie hates watching me play games.
4238588	4240968	She's like, I want to watch TV instead.
4242229	4243869	Jamie, you do this to some extent, right?
4243949	4252072	You've told stories on the show before when you and Dan were gaming together that you would help him through Resident Evil, but you would just be kind of content in watching him, right?
4252492	4252672	Yeah.
4253293	4257514	So would it be fair to say some people are okay with just watching people play games?
4258792	4259092	I don't know.
4259333	4259793	Well, great.
4259833	4262256	They can go ahead and start up their professional gaming league.
4262276	4263758	It'll be like the fucking XFL.
4263818	4268083	It'll be around for a couple years, and then it will fade into dust.
4268584	4271808	Like it should, because no one wants to watch this shit.
4271928	4276213	I mean, seriously, people, gamers don't even watch... We were actually playing together.
4277534	4277735	Okay.
4279502	4283305	Remember that stupid show on G4 Arena, okay?
4283345	4283886	Remember that?
4284146	4286308	I mean, granted, it had an interesting idea.
4286628	4287809	Let's watch gamers play games.
4288009	4288630	And it sucked.
4288770	4289891	It sucked really, really bad.
4289931	4290331	You know why?
4290391	4291532	Because it's watching people play games.
4291552	4296596	The problem with Arena was just the way the show was kind of formulated.
4297717	4298798	I don't think it was the...
4300575	4301356	Thanks for watching!
4317475	4327718	I don't know, Rockstar or something like that so I can watch you play some stupid game that I could be playing right now and win $50,000 and go, I'm fucking awesome.
4327858	4330959	Let me make my own keyboard brand and sell it for uber money.
4333320	4333840	Are you done?
4333860	4334220	No.
4334260	4336821	Now I'm done.
4336841	4340042	You're such a dick.
4340182	4341022	I swear to God.
4342103	4344423	Okay, RossDLUT brings up an excellent point.
4344903	4346324	How about Starcade?
4347407	4375292	Starcade was awesome and you watched other people play games or Nick Arcade for that matter those games rocked bring that shit back I would love to see that that's good but fucking watching clan members or whatever fucking play multiplayer games and shit that's kind of boring but I'd be down for like an 80's style show or something where it's just people facing off in the arcades like their forefathers did so you will watch people play games under the right circumstances
4376371	4377712	I'll play arcade games.
4377953	4378553	Liar.
4379194	4379514	Liar.
4381316	4382437	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4382638	4383919	Liar is not the right word.
4383999	4388303	The word I'm thinking of starts with an H. Homosexual?
4388524	4389204	Hypocrite.
4389885	4390546	Oh, hypocrite.
4392027	4393489	No, Rob, that's just you.
4393669	4393949	All right.
4394570	4394910	Anyway.
4395671	4397573	That show's not on TV anymore, so fuck that.
4397613	4398153	I don't care.
4399094	4399655	All right, anyhow.
4400930	4403871	and M60... Oh no, I guess GS68 said it first.
4403911	4404371	Hentai?
4404591	4405691	Was that the word you were thinking of?
4405991	4406591	Hentai?
4409472	4423434	Dear Rob... Speaking of hentai, DarkSakura likes to surf the internet every week for yaoiboyfun.com and I don't know what she's looking at, but she likes to... Oh yes, explicit.
4424294	4425415	Are you going to YaoiCon?
4426375	4426695	Maybe.
4426715	4427215	Of course.
4428377	4429557	DarkSakura's website of the week.
4429577	4430558	Let's talk about a little bit of Yaoi.
4457381	4477275	for those of you guys who don't know what yaoi is it's art that is you explain it DarkSakura I can't it's man on man action imagine like the uber sweet sappy you know typical heterosexual relationship and then change the gender of one of them to male okay
4478058	4479079	Good definition.
4479579	4482200	But as I understand it, Yaoi is not made for gay men.
4482300	4483361	It's not gay porn.
4483401	4484122	It's not gay anime.
4484142	4485262	It's made for straight girls.
4485542	4487083	Yaoi is made for girls.
4488124	4492967	So, I get asked all the time, because Yaoi is man-on-man action, are you going YaoiCon?
4493587	4502172	And I say, okay, well as a gay man, the last place I want to be on the planet is a hotel full of horny straight women.
4502192	4502272	Yeah.
4505945	4506506	I mean, really.
4507006	4510409	So stop asking me if I'm going to go to YowieCon, because the answer is no.
4513831	4515853	YuriCon, maybe, because I love my lesbians.
4516033	4517074	I love my lesbians.
4517634	4519636	Might go to YuriCon, but I don't know about YowieCon.
4519976	4520497	All right, sorry.
4521317	4522818	Sorry for the aside, DarkSakura.
4522838	4525741	I apologize for cutting into your precious website of the week time.
4525881	4527062	We needed to have some YowieChat.
4527642	4528843	Can we do your website of the week now?
4529243	4529664	Sure.
4529824	4530264	All right, here we go.
4530284	4531785	Because I'm just playing with this stupid thing anyway.
4531805	4532326	All right, here we go.
4540049	4545871	So, the website of the week is FallingSandGame.com, which I have no idea what the purpose of this game is for anyway.
4546672	4549713	But it's really stupid, and all I'm doing is just watching it do shit.
4550493	4556275	Yeah, that's a game from the same people who do Cat with Bo Golf or something.
4558836	4565079	I don't know, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing other than drawing lines and trying to make this thing destroy my sandslides.
4566789	4569069	It's that thing that's running around on the outside.
4569089	4570370	You're supposed to hit it with sand.
4570990	4572070	Is this like Yoshi's Touch and Go?
4572090	4574331	I've been hitting it with sand, and it's not doing anything.
4575651	4576931	Are you sure this game is fun?
4577251	4578391	Because it explodes.
4578891	4584013	They have one that's also with slugs, and you have to pour salt on them.
4584533	4585213	I hate slugs.
4585253	4587333	I'm actually slug-phobic, people.
4588493	4590054	You now know what my deepest fear is.
4590134	4590594	Slugs.
4591614	4592554	And snails.
4592754	4594415	Because I keep pouring sand on it.
4594435	4596015	I think it's the type of sand I'm using.
4597520	4611723	Grossant I want the sea monkey to gain Or that I can flush them down the toilet That's the only thing missing from Sims 2 Pets Funerals?
4612404	4614764	No, flushing animals down the toilet Funerals!
4615464	4616145	Fish funerals!
4617405	4618245	Remember when I had fish?
4618265	4624407	This is fantastic I prefer to call them funerals It's just like, what the hell is this crap?
4624567	4625987	Alright, give that URL one more time
4626701	4630663	FallingSandGame.com Dude, I just set the ball of sand on fire.
4630703	4631124	That's great.
4631144	4631444	Can I move on?
4631484	4632404	Are you finished?
4632444	4632945	No, this is great.
4632965	4638768	What is up with you people tonight and not being able to finish in a reasonable amount of time?
4638788	4639328	I am paying attention.
4654617	4656939	I'm playing with the Sand Game.
4656959	4659261	Can I talk about BlizzCon while you're playing with the Sand Game?
4659281	4659521	Sure.
4659561	4661323	Because I'm a little upset about this.
4662243	4667227	As you know, I've been gone for the past two weeks, and during that time, tickets for BlizzCon went on sale.
4667948	4670910	And I actually was going to go to BlizzCon this year.
4671371	4677176	Well, I get home and find out that the tickets went on sale June 13th, and then promptly sold out on June 15th.
4679230	4682452	So, tickets for BlizzCon 2007 already sold out.
4682472	4685673	If you haven't heard, it's August 3rd and 4th at the Anaheim Convention Center.
4686354	4688515	And, you know, if you go, you're supposed to get all this free stuff.
4688935	4691316	I, however, will not be going, and I'm a little bit bitter about it.
4693237	4694018	Are you going to cry?
4694918	4695398	A little bit.
4695518	4696619	Actually, no, I'm not going to cry.
4696679	4697560	I'm going to get angsty.
4697900	4700061	And you know what happens on this show when people get angsty?
4711139	4712360	FUs of the week time.
4712420	4713621	DarkSakura, start us off.
4713661	4717304	I'm trying to get the information out of my purse because I'm going to tell people exactly where the fuck I went.
4718544	4720766	Fuck you to the idiot at Quiznos.
4722667	4724969	I wanted my sandwich.
4725890	4735697	I specifically wanted a Philly cheesesteak sandwich on whole wheat bread with no mayonnaise and no sauce on it.
4736037	4738759	Just meat and cheese and onions on wheat.
4739446	4741587	And I didn't want it burned either, I want it toasted.
4742628	4748291	So the guy's like, I'm like, okay, I want two goats.
4748551	4750332	Were you being served by Ozzy Osbourne?
4750512	4751793	No, I was being served by a moron.
4753494	4756255	And so I was like, okay, dude, I want a Philly cheesesteak.
4756455	4757616	No mayonnaise.
4758457	4760998	So he starts putting mayonnaise, and I'm like, dude, I said no mayonnaise.
4761318	4762019	Oh, I'm sorry.
4763319	4764140	And then he puts it in.
4764920	4766461	And I get it, and he's like, okay, prime ribs.
4766681	4768142	No, I said Philly cheesesteak.
4768960	4770181	Oh, okay, I'll go add cheese.
4771423	4771703	What?
4772904	4777248	And then he rings it up as... I was like, dude, okay, first of all, you bring me up as a prime rib.
4777869	4779270	It's a different price.
4779751	4782013	He's like, oh, well, this is cheaper, so I'll just charge you for that.
4782533	4783154	Okay, fine, whatever.
4783174	4785937	So finally, I just ended up saying, where's your manager?
4786217	4787418	Oh, the manager's only here in the morning.
4788079	4790241	Okay, so it's Quiznos number 1129 on...
4793959	4795760	What is that road that's off of Zinfandel?
4796020	4796740	I don't know.
4796840	4797521	Not White Rock.
4797601	4799262	Just call it off of Zinfandel.
4799522	4800102	Zinfandel and 50.
4800222	4803784	It's off of Zinfandel near 50, yeah.
4804044	4806725	Across the street from Target and Cheezer's Pizza.
4806785	4807866	Olsen, it's Olsen Drive.
4807946	4809026	Olsen, I used to work on that road.
4809546	4812348	Okay, it's on Olsen in Rancho Cambodia.
4815449	4819251	And the guy's name was, I can't pronounce it, but it's A-K-O-B.
4821534	4824398	Don't ever let this guy make you a sandwich because he'll burn it!
4825699	4827542	You saw my sandwich, Rob!
4827582	4828243	It was pretty burnt.
4831025	4835988	I just came back from Philadelphia and you can't get cheesesteaks anywhere else like you can there.
4836028	4837729	There's a reason they are Philly cheesesteaks.
4838050	4838350	I know this.
4838370	4839391	Everything else is suck.
4839451	4842513	But dude, I have never had such idiotic service anywhere.
4842873	4846295	And I'm like, I can understand, you know, missing it once.
4846776	4849437	But the dude wasn't even freaking listening to me anytime I said something.
4849497	4851018	I was like, I want a small drink.
4851059	4852540	He gives me a fucking large cup.
4852600	4854001	I'm like, dude, small.
4854141	4855301	Jamie, maybe he was high.
4856622	4857163	No, he was.
4857763	4858984	I can tell him somebody's high.
4859525	4860485	He was not red-eyed.
4861265	4867126	He was not stealing the cheese out of the thing.
4867226	4870567	He just was speaking in a whisper and not listening.
4870607	4877108	He was looking off into space and like, dude, I don't care how much you hate your job, you can at least do it right, you know?
4877868	4878388	So, whatever.
4879388	4884869	Alright, thank you, DarkSakura, for your very specific and directed angst tonight.
4885610	4886930	Loki, your FUs of the week.
4888090	4888190	Uh...
4889279	4893561	FD of the Week goes to Christopher's desk for being rotted.
4894381	4895382	That is really foul.
4895682	4900544	Like, I had to put a cup over the giant pile of rot.
4902205	4904305	It's literally, there's, like, stuff growing.
4905926	4907607	I'm creating a wall with cans.
4908667	4911388	I don't have enough yet, so I have to drink a couple more cans.
4912429	4912849	Is that it?
4913129	4914030	That's it.
4914110	4917311	My FD of the Week goes to myself.
4918161	4926605	and the Target that's across the street from said Quiznos because I was there and I was buying some diet soda.
4926625	4929726	In fact, the IBC root beer I'm consuming right now that's mixed with Malibu.
4930126	4940131	I was buying that and as I was pulling it off the shelf, it got caught on the cream soda next to it and so all the IBC cream soda went all over the floor and there was breaking glass everywhere.
4940171	4943472	It made a beautiful noise, but F you to myself for being such a klutz.
4943713	4945673	Old you fucking cream soda sucks, see?
4946014	4946534	Now you know.
4947659	4950961	Alright, uh, explicit, any FUs tonight?
4952002	4958386	Let's see, um, an FU to having a flat tire during the road while I was trying to go to my cousin's graduation.
4959067	4959927	I brought a lot of stuff.
4960387	4965231	Luckily, I came into the party rather than not being able to make it.
4966772	4971635	FU goes to pretty much everybody keeps overrating the over 9,000 joke.
4972776	4974777	What is the over 9,000 joke, dare I ask?
4975368	4981251	Okay, if you go to YouTube, just type in over 9000 up at Google.com.
4981591	4982852	Is it a Dragon Ball Z thing?
4982912	4983452	Yeah.
4983512	4984653	Okay, I have seen it.
4985193	4988975	His power level is over 9000!
4989255	4994697	DMN linked me to something or sent us a song or something and I wanted to poke him in the eye with a fork.
4995178	4996338	Yeah, so I know what you're talking about now.
4996378	4997419	Yeah, exactly.
4997459	4999760	I hear that almost every freaking day.
5000820	5010246	Um, let's see, if it goes to my coworkers for trying to make me break New Year's resolution, I'm not sure if you guys will know that the New Year's resolution I gave up for the whole year.
5011807	5012467	Dare I ask?
5012627	5013828	Not erections again, is it?
5013868	5014388	No, no, no.
5014448	5015889	You gave up sex or masturbating?
5016089	5016670	Masturbation.
5016810	5018711	You gave up masturbating for a whole year?
5018731	5019491	Yeah.
5020152	5021072	Oh my god.
5021232	5022793	Are you having sex with women at least?
5023734	5024835	Uh, sadly no.
5025075	5027036	Oh my god, you're gonna die.
5028328	5029409	You should just get a hooker.
5031030	5031650	For real.
5033151	5035973	Wow, you're a brave man, that's all I have to say.
5037534	5039936	Let's see, another F you goes to everybody.
5040096	5042298	I'm still talking about the 300 Sparta joke.
5044099	5045280	Combined with a Chuck Norris.
5046761	5049743	Hey, I got a shirt that says, This is Zelda!
5050043	5051204	That was actually funny.
5051244	5051844	Yeah, I got that.
5051864	5052885	That was good times.
5053245	5055807	F you to some of the kids in Sadgun for asking me for money.
5056619	5061782	Okay, if you... I don't know, I'm not sure how much money these kids spend on a con.
5063042	5071166	Especially with their, like, $110 swords and their $50 Naruto jacket, etc., etc., etc.
5071266	5073848	Oh, God, we're gonna be starting on that.
5075749	5078950	Let's see, and... Well, that's all for now.
5078970	5084413	I always like how he always leaves it with, that's all for now, and then he'll be back, like, in a year.
5085262	5089144	Here's some FUs I've collected over the past year that I'd like to share with you.
5090245	5091906	Here, actually, actually, I found something.
5092406	5093727	I found something just for you.
5095228	5096489	This is just for you, Jonas.
5111324	5113226	for $9,000!
5113746	5117770	Stop it!
5122874	5124575	Isn't that one of the most god-awful things you've ever heard?
5124595	5125676	That was made by DMN.
5125917	5127738	Oh, gee, didn't see that coming.
5130861	5132302	I'll send you the MP3 later, Jonas.
5134284	5134664	Anyhow.
5135365	5135705	Anyways.
5136181	5137302	Can we get back to games, please?
5137402	5147107	So something kind of cool came down to the Xbox Live video marketplace, and once I saw it, I thought, well, I don't know, I had to watch it, but I didn't.
5148308	5152610	Basically, the Xbox Live marketplace, among other things, got a whole bunch of anime.
5152970	5159314	So that's pretty awesome, including Guyver, Trinity Blood, Gunslinger Girl, Speedgrapher, Basilick,
5160329	5173075	Sayuki, Kitty Grade, The Count of Monte Cristo, Desert Punk, Last Exile, Rumbling Hearts, Galaxy Railways, Gilgamesh, and Lupin the Third Part 2.
5173916	5179358	But it also got Akira, and Akira in HD, which is fucking awesome.
5180459	5185301	So definitely worth checking out, especially if you're an anime fan, because that's one of the best anime movies I think of all time.
5186468	5190450	and I believe Lady Death was also on there in HD so that's something else.
5192030	5194571	Then beyond all that National Geographic shit.
5194891	5198653	So you got National Geographic Adventure and yeah.
5199993	5202554	So watch some Akira in HD.
5203155	5204135	Can I tell you a secret?
5204998	5209040	Most people assume that because I do this show, I watch a ton of anime, which is so not true.
5209520	5210561	I've never seen Akira.
5211001	5211481	Why?
5211941	5212782	I just haven't.
5213122	5213962	The manga's better.
5214022	5214923	Don't watch the anime.
5215163	5215883	No, no, no, no.
5216223	5218304	The anime is fucking awesome, and you know why?
5218344	5219485	No, no, no, no.
5219525	5220225	I started a fight.
5220985	5225367	I remember going to this place called Steamers or whatever.
5225507	5230289	It was a coffee shop slash video rental place.
5230550	5231370	It was like one of the...
5232239	5233241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5248499	5249479	It's a fucking awesome movie.
5249499	5251560	One of the main characters.
5279068	5307073	and it's got like a character read the manga it's got a character that looks like Louis Anderson so you gotta that is true you gotta watch it and he kinda sounds like I hate Louis Anderson you're not selling me this but he gets killed oh spoiler and 50 and 50 year old children can we please move on he's like old Louis Anderson can we finish part A tonight at some point and the clowns if old Louis Anderson oh yeah the clowns if old Louis Anderson could like do you know psychokinetic shit that's fucking awesome
5307774	5311117	Has this show really lasted five years, somehow?
5311457	5312097	Not yet!
5313338	5316120	That's right, it could all end tonight, boys and girls.
5316321	5316881	Crash!
5316961	5317742	We're getting close.
5318562	5320424	Okay, can we talk about something else, Rob?
5320584	5320824	Sure.
5321044	5321525	Read the manga.
5323726	5324887	Shut the fuck up and read a story.
5325207	5326228	Okay.
5327049	5327729	Well, guess what?
5327749	5332273	You know that Castlevania film that was supposed to be done by Paul W.S.
5332373	5332773	Anderson?
5333654	5334755	Well, he said, fuck y'all.
5336156	5336516	Not really.
5336929	5338470	He said, I'm working on other projects.
5339852	5341693	He's remaking Death Race.
5342734	5343595	And that is awesome.
5343615	5344976	That's more priority over Castlevania.
5345217	5345557	I agree.
5345797	5345977	Yes.
5347198	5357087	However, the one that they are getting to replace him is Sylvain White, who brought us such classics as Stomp the Yard and I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer.
5357107	5363153	Such great American cinema classics.
5363632	5379341	he is quoted saying most of the vampire films have been present or set in the future from Blade to Underworld and I was attracted to the chance to make a dark epic period movie that almost had an anime feel to it well there's Castlevania right the fuck there Van Helsing?
5380481	5380741	anybody?
5380781	5390787	yeah but that wasn't a good movie it just had Hugh Jackman being sexy and that's it but it had vampires and it was a period piece but it was a bad movie what about Bram Stoker's Dracula?
5391167	5392888	that was sexy oh my god
5393607	5393987	Anybody?
5394467	5396088	How about Interview with a Vampire?
5396108	5398970	That movie was so hot, I would make love to it if I could.
5398990	5405413	But that was sort of multiple... It was part period, part present, part... Part just, like, gay.
5405533	5407274	It's a gay movie.
5407294	5409555	I disrespected making out all over the place.
5409595	5410115	For real.
5410696	5411396	That was a good movie.
5411456	5420480	He probably just doesn't watch a lot of those classic films, you know, because he's in a whole other, you know, decade now, so... Who watches any of that stuff?
5421121	5421381	Well...
5422977	5433606	I have to say that maybe he might have some... I mean, if he gets the imagery off, then that'll be good.
5433666	5439411	But you know what's also interesting that he's going to be directing is Ronan, Frank Miller.
5441152	5443194	As long as it's not Paul W.S.
5443334	5444635	Anderson or Revol.
5445716	5448098	We need someone else to make fun of for making crappy movies.
5448238	5450400	Everyone has to start off somewhere, right?
5451713	5454954	Well, he did do I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer.
5455254	5458015	That's a springboard, I'll say.
5458115	5461476	I'm going to try to have some faith because you know me and my Castlevania.
5461596	5462096	Oh my God.
5462276	5464117	I will withhold judgment until the film is done.
5464157	5465277	That's only fair, right?
5465638	5466138	Right, Halo.
5466158	5467178	Everybody deserves a chance.
5467358	5467938	Right, Halo.
5469279	5469519	What?
5469859	5470139	Halo.
5470592	5470952	Halo.
5471172	5473874	You said yourself that you passed judgment on Halo.
5473934	5475395	Have you learned your lesson, Bob?
5475475	5477437	I so got pwned just now.
5477517	5478417	Have you learned your lesson?
5478597	5480239	No, I'll never learn my lesson.
5480279	5481880	Haven't you learned that after five years?
5482840	5483921	I know, but I'm not going to tell.
5483981	5485822	I'll always know where Jigglypuff is hiding.
5489574	5509240	and now I think it's about time to say goodbye to part A of Orange Lounge Radio we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back after a little break with more of Orange Lounge Radio for those of you guys listening live here on Sunday night you get part B just in a few minutes but for those of you guys listening to us on our audio archive or podcast feed you just have to wait a couple days we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio
