00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,700
twice weekly.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:12,220

to websites with listings of past episodes.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,540
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,260
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this part B of episode number 236 and

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,100
this of course is our fifth year anniversary show.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
That's right.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:36,780
On June 23, 2002, we went live for the very first time with Orange Lounge Radio live episode

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,540
number one where some of the topics included, God, what were we talking about that week?

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
I don't even remember.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,500
I think it was kind of more like an intro to the show when we were talking about our

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,900
experiences playing various games at Golf Land and things like that.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,340
I remember in episode number two and three early on in the show we started to get into

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,220
that whole controversy about how like needles were showing up in the background in DDR Solo.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,220
Remember that?

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,220
Yeah.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,220
Back in the day.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,360
But we've grown a lot since then and now we talk about all types of games because as we

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,340
said back in 2006 when we merged our shows, we're gaming fans first and music games just

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,580
happen to be a little subsection of that.

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,660
But I thought for those of you guys that have been listening for as long as you have, unfortunately

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,660
the full first episode is on a backup drive somewhere that I wasn't able to access today

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,020
so I couldn't find it.

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,280
But I do have this.

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,860
We used to run little promo spots on our station that would flash back the episode.

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,740
So here was the highlight clip, or shall we say, from the very first episode of Orange

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,860
Lounge Radio.

29
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,300
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,540
Attention to parents at Golf Land, and this goes for not just Roseland Golf Land, but

31
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
any golf land.

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,540
Any arcade.

33
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,540
Because Jamie circulates a lot.

34
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,540
She gets around, Jamie.

35
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,540
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,540
Baby.

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
Every different arcade.

38
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,540
Who gets around?

39
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,540
I'm six and arcade four.

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,540
If you don't, mother your child.

41
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,540
Baby will.

42
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,540
Yes.

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,540
I will spank your child.

44
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,100
If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

45
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,100
Join us every Sunday night from seven o'clock until nine o'clock.

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,420
No, the times have changed.

47
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,420
The times have changed.

48
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,020
But there you have it.

49
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,980
So look, Dark Sakura was kind of a jerk from episode one.

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
I'm not.

51
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
I'm teasing.

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,980
I'm teasing.

53
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,500
I got tired of, because ever since that woman tried to change her baby's diaper on the keyboard

54
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,300
mania, I was like, oh God.

55
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,540
In fact, today, I have a modification to that.

56
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,900
If you won't take care of your child, I will have someone kill you, because I'm not going

57
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
to take care of your child.

58
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Wow.

59
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
I don't know about that.

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,620
I'll have you shot in the head.

61
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,340
Head shot for the win.

62
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,020
Press A. Some users in chat are commenting on the quality

63
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,020
of that clip.

64
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,020
That's right.

65
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,820
When Orange Launch Radio started, we were on a dial-up friendly stream.

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,360
So the stream you could hear was usable on 56K modems, because five years ago, a lot

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,420
of people still were on those.

68
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,380
By the way, do you still own the drive that you have that saved on?

69
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,380
Somewhere.

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
I don't know.

71
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,060
If you can find it, I may have a way to extract it.

72
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,060
That's cool.

73
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,580
No, I think we have it on CD back up somewhere too.

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,740
If nonetheless- If we could get a hold of a certain somebody,

75
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,740
we could get it.

76
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,780
There's a certain angel that might come to our rescue that I know has every episode of

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,780
OLR.

78
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,780
You know what?

79
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
I'm just going to ask her right now.

80
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,780
If she's around, please do.

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
On my journal.

82
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
All right.

83
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,140
I'll put that up for download or something.

84
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,860
But anyway, so yeah, this is a little bit of an ego episode, I guess.

85
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,300
We're done with the gaming news.

86
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,540
We did it in part A, although I have to say this real quick.

87
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,140
One little piece of gaming news.

88
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,380
Because we tape live on Sunday nights, as we have for the past five years, sometimes

89
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,940
things change as the show is going on, and that's what's happening tonight.

90
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,120
Thank you, Rene, for the news tip here, but Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q, just posted

91
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,660
about the whole addiction story and the AMA we were talking about in the first part.

92
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,260
Apparently it's come down the wire that the doctors from the AMA have backed away from

93
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,360
their decision.

94
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,840
They're now recommending that the American Psychiatric Association, who kind of would

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,500
be the final judge and jury in this anyway, do a little more research, quote, there is

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,160
nothing here to suggest that this is a complex physiological disease state akin to alcoholism

97
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,700
or other substance abuse disorders, and it doesn't get to have the word addiction attached

98
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700
to it.

99
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,460
That comes from Dr. Stuart Gitlow, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and also Mount

100
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,900
Sinai School of Medicine in New York.

101
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,220
Things change while we're live.

102
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,620
I kind of figured it would be.

103
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Like I said in part A, addiction is kind of a part of something bigger.

104
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,620
I don't think it's addiction.

105
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
I think it's OCD.

106
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,460
Well, anyhow, as we promised here in part B, we have a pizza on the way.

107
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,460
We're just going to...

108
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,460
Our bread and cheese to go with our wine.

109
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,300
We're going to just kind of kick back and relax because, as we've said a lot this evening,

110
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,300
Orange Launch Radio is about you guys.

111
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,340
We get asked all the time, when we started this, there wasn't really a lot on the internet

112
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,500
like us.

113
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
There was a few other...

114
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
I'm not saying that as an ego thing.

115
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,380
I'm just saying that's kind of the way it was.

116
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,380
There wasn't a lot of...

117
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm not trying to say we were pioneers or whatever, but there wasn't a lot of live gaming

118
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,340
shows that taped.

119
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,540
I didn't even find out until years later there was this all-games network that had existed

120
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,140
for 10 years, but funny enough, we started while they were on hiatus because of G4 and

121
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,660
everything, and Scott working at G4, and now it's kind of funny that we work together,

122
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,780
but regardless of all that.

123
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,000
I just say that because I know we've gained a lot of listeners thanks to our partnership

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,460
with all games, but there wasn't a lot like us when we started, at least that we knew

125
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,460
about.

126
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,980
It's kind of interesting because now that podcasting is so huge, and essentially any

127
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,900
idiot with a microphone can have a podcast, which really any idiot with a microphone before

128
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,220
could do an internet radio show.

129
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,580
There weren't a lot of people motivated to do it.

130
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,140
It wasn't an easy thing.

131
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,620
We really have to distinguish ourselves.

132
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,980
We get asked a lot, why should I subscribe to your show when there's like 500 other shows

133
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:00,000
out there I could subscribe to about games, and we've always said because we have true

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,260
live interaction.

135
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,740
We like to pretend we're sitting around at a big table with our listeners and just talking

136
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,180
about the latest in gaming.

137
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,260
Sometimes we break stories, although we probably won't be breaking them too much more in the

138
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,060
future, but we're not usually thought of as a source for breaking news.

139
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,140
There's plenty of other game blogs who are paid to bring you breaking news.

140
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,660
We don't get paid for this.

141
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,300
That's kind of what distinguishes us from everybody else is the listeners, the chatters,

142
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,280
the live interaction that we have.

143
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:38,780
Tonight during part B, we're going to open up the Skype line and let you guys take control.

144
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:46,340
The Skype line is open, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

145
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,500
Just give us a call and it's open and you can talk about pretty much anything.

146
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,580
It's an open forum tonight.

147
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,700
If you want to say congratulations, then cool, we'll take that and be very thankful for it.

148
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,180
If you want to ask us a question, you can do that too.

149
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,800
If you want to talk about what's been big in gaming for the past five years, you can

150
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,500
do that too.

151
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,860
Let's start it off with a call and we're going to go over here first.

152
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,220
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

153
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,220
Who's this?

154
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,220
Hi, guys.

155
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,660
This is Footy Monster from Argentina.

156
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,980
Wow, I got the first call.

157
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
You did?

158
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,740
You got the first call, Footy Monster?

159
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Good for you.

160
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740
What's on your mind?

161
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,740
Well, first of all, guys, I just wanted to say happy fifth birthday.

162
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,860
You've been with me at least for the last two years when I've actually found you guys

163
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,340
right before you went into iTunes and it's been a great two years, dude.

164
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
It's amazing.

165
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,540
We've been there every Sunday, give or take, and it's pretty cool to have that familiar

166
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,340
voice go with you all the time.

167
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,940
I appreciate that and I don't know the other field, but from my perspective, having a listener

168
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,460
from a far away, quote unquote, place like Argentina is really cool to us.

169
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,380
The fact that the internet makes the world smaller in that regard and that we're able

170
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,000
to sit around and talk about gaming, for me, it's very cool and I love hearing from the

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
international people.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,780
Don't get me wrong, I love the US citizens too, but hearing from the British folks that

173
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,000
call in, the Australian folks that call in, Argentina folks that call in, it's really

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,580
interesting to hear what gaming is like in your neck of the woods because we don't always

175
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
get to see that here.

176
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,940
Well, actually, yeah, I called before about it once and basically there's no official

177
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,900
gaming market here, so everything's got a market like a 360 cost $700 and a PS3 cost

178
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,200
$1,400.

179
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,420
Do you get a lot of gaming fans down there?

180
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
There is a lot.

181
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,720
I mean, here, there is still an arcade scene, so to speak, so we will see a lot of pump

182
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,820
it up, DDR, maybe some guitar freaks, maybe, just maybe because there's like a few machines,

183
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,140
but like the King of Fighters crowd is still there, they go to the arcades because those

184
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,460
things are still affordable, so to speak.

185
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,960
Okay, I get that.

186
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
That's cool.

187
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Very cool.

188
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,620
And I mean, here, the PS2 is still full blown.

189
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,500
There's no next gen here yet because you can seriously go buy a backup of a PS2 game for

190
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,580
five bucks.

191
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,380
You got any questions for us tonight or anything you wanted to say?

192
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,060
Because if you don't have anything for us, we'll grill you.

193
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,100
I mean, yeah, I actually have one question.

194
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,660
What do you have to say to, I mean, as you know, after iTunes and after all these gaming

195
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,220
podcasts came out, many of us, of the listeners, actually started our own ventures into the

196
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,220
thing.

197
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,020
Myself, I don't know if you guys remember, I have my own show, The Ultimate Quest, it's

198
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,740
an RPG exclusive show, which just started out like a few months ago.

199
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Good plug.

200
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,780
I mean, yeah, I'm just, I tried to mention it there.

201
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,140
But what do you say to us that actually are starting out?

202
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,940
How do you, what do you tell us, maybe a good advice or something that helps us keep at

203
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,900
it when you're like life sucks and you don't want to edit the show that day and you just

204
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,980
want to not do that thing that week?

205
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,140
What's your advice to all of us who are starting out?

206
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,660
I say the sooner you get it done, the sooner you don't have to do it again.

207
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,100
Get it out of the way, out of spite.

208
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,140
I told you, everything I do practically is motivated by spite.

209
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
And porn.

210
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,700
No, not so much the porn.

211
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,900
Life is things to go.

212
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,100
That's why my show kind of stopped twice.

213
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,060
Here's my advice, Footy Monster, if you're doing the show, and I'm just saying this in

214
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,620
general, I'm not saying this at you, but in general to anybody who's thinking about starting

215
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,660
a podcast doing this, if you are doing this program or if you're doing a program to try

216
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,660
and get more listeners than anyone else or try to get a listener count that's through

217
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,060
the roof or to try and get a listener base that's the biggest one you've ever seen, you're

218
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,220
doing this for the wrong reasons.

219
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,380
Yeah, I wouldn't even start if that was the reason because I used to crowd and there's

220
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
no listeners.

221
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,700
You have to know though, there are people out there that that is their sole motivation

222
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
is attention.

223
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
And don't get me wrong.

224
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Attention is lovely.

225
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,920
I mean, the attention horse side of me is what keeps me motivated for the past five

226
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
years.

227
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Attention can be bad sometimes.

228
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,300
Yeah, attention can be bad as we learned a couple months ago.

229
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,100
But regardless, you've got to do this because especially in these panel-based shows, you've

230
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,820
got to really like the people that you're hanging out with.

231
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,180
You know, you've really got to love the topic that you're talking about.

232
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
Or be able to fake it.

233
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:19,100
You know, and I'm sure there's been those weeks where I've wanted to come in here and

234
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,500
choke a bitch, namely Jamie.

235
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,980
But at the end of the day, I love her and she's wanted to punch me in the face on several

236
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
occasions.

237
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
Really?

238
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Really?

239
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,460
Well, just like an example, you know, I came in the start of the show kind of bummed out

240
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,180
and I'm all happy now, but of course I also have alcohol down.

241
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,940
But no, for real, and I'm not saying that, you know, that's very rare that that kind

242
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,980
of thing ever happens where like, you know, I'm like, oh, I'm mad at somebody tonight

243
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,820
or I'm mad at the world and I'm going to take it out on Jamie tonight or Loki or whatever.

244
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,320
But it's like an opportunity for us to get together and just kind of like, this is kind

245
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,100
of how I hang out with Jamie.

246
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,180
And these days, I used to live with Matt, but now this is how I hang out with him.

247
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
You know, it's kind of through this show.

248
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,180
Yeah, you never call.

249
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
You never write.

250
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
That's not true.

251
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,180
What am I supposed to think?

252
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,180
That's not true.

253
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,800
Rob has left me.

254
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,580
To us listeners, it seems like you guys are hanging out like 24-7 because the chemistry

255
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,900
that you guys have on air, it's just amazing.

256
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,340
And it's like brothers and sisters.

257
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,180
You want to poke them in the eye just because you're annoyed at them.

258
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
And that's what it is.

259
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,180
Jamie's my gaming sister.

260
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,740
Matt's my gaming brother.

261
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Poking in the eye.

262
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,740
I've never thought of that.

263
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,740
She has glasses, though.

264
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,660
I can't do that.

265
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,500
I have protective eyewear.

266
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Roar.

267
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,220
Well, Footy Monster, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks

268
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,220
so much for calling in.

269
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Appreciate it.

270
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,220
Okay?

271
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,220
All right.

272
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,220
Well, you guys keep it up.

273
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,220
And happy 5th anniversary.

274
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,220
Let's hope there's another five more.

275
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
Appreciate it.

276
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,220
And hey, quick question for you.

277
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,140
How long have you and the girl in your icon, who I believe was Canadian, how long have

278
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,140
you two been together now?

279
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,860
We've been together three years and a half, and I'm actually going to see her in a month.

280
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,860
So yeah, yay me.

281
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,860
Congrats to you two.

282
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,220
I just want to point out to Loki and Jamie, look at that cute little icon there.

283
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,220
They're kissing.

284
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Ah, get a room.

285
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
Get a room.

286
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,220
Aw.

287
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,220
I can't see.

288
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
I can't see with your big, fat shoulder.

289
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Sorry.

290
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,220
I'm just clicking away because other calls are dropping in.

291
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,220
Oh, that is cute.

292
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
All right.

293
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,220
There you go.

294
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
All right, guys.

295
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,220
Well, I'll let you guys go so you can take more calls.

296
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
All right.

297
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
We had to embarrass you on Air Footy.

298
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,220
My turn.

299
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
All right.

300
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
Take care, Footy.

301
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,220
All right.

302
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,220
Bye-bye.

303
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
See y'all.

304
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,220
All right.

305
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,220
You want to answer our call, Jamie?

306
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,220
Yeah.

307
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
Click the button.

308
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
I'm going to give you a good one, Jamie.

309
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,220
Hey, this is Orange Mountains Radio.

310
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,220
What the hell do you want?

311
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
It's Ravenstaufen.

312
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
Hi.

313
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,220
Hi, Dark Sakura.

314
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,220
You scared me.

315
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,220
Good.

316
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,900
What do you want?

317
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
What are you selling?

318
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Amway?

319
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Never mind.

320
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,940
My podcast, but I'm not going there because I agree with you.

321
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,620
If you're doing this for the wrong... If you're doing this for listenership, no.

322
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
Do it for the love.

323
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
Absolutely.

324
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,500
I do it for drugs.

325
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,420
You know what, Ravenstaufen?

326
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,980
You of all people are a very interesting person to be making this point, and I say this with

327
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,120
the most love in my heart here, is that you get a lot of shit, not only from this program,

328
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,780
but I know our friends over at AllGames.com constantly give you a hard time, yet you don't

329
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,000
let it faze you one bit.

330
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You really don't.

331
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,700
You keep coming back.

332
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,580
It's obvious to me, despite whatever people think of you and your phone calls, you got

333
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,440
a lot of love for gaming and for this community, right?

334
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,100
I have a bunch of love for this community and video gaming.

335
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
I really do.

336
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,980
I've been gaming since I was three.

337
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Three.

338
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
Amen.

339
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
You've got me beat.

340
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,300
I started when I was four or five, I think.

341
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
I don't remember.

342
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,060
Where were you when you started gaming, Darzaka?

343
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
Do you really want to know?

344
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Yeah.

345
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,540
I think I was three when The Odyssey 2 came out.

346
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,580
The Odyssey 2, I believe, came out in 1979, which I turned three in 1979.

347
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,100
I know that dates me.

348
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,820
I turned three in 1979, so if that shows, that was my first gaming system.

349
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,340
Loki, what about you?

350
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,100
I played the ColecoVision.

351
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,100
I don't remember.

352
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,660
It's like round four.

353
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,060
My mom was playing Pac-Man when she was pregnant with me.

354
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Wow.

355
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
So it runs in the family.

356
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
Pong.

357
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
Pong.

358
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Sorry.

359
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
It runs in the family.

360
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
And pinball.

361
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
Very cool.

362
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
Wow.

363
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
What was your first game, Ravenstaufen?

364
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,660
Believe it or not, it was Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo.

365
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Thank goodness.

366
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Oh, you kids.

367
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,280
You were three when that came out?

368
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
I was three.

369
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
Oh, my God.

370
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Sorry.

371
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
I feel old.

372
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I know.

373
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
You just reminded me how old I am.

374
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
No, no.

375
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
No worries.

376
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
No worries.

377
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
It's all good.

378
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm sorry I missed out on all the 8-bit action, but it's not my fault.

379
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,140
Smurfs and Bump N' Jump.

380
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,780
Dude, I hella remember Smurfs in the Atari Smurfs.

381
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,180
Our game was Mouse Trap.

382
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,180
And we had Turbo, but we had a setup for Turbo.

383
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:00,020
We would grab a chair and a TV tray and put the driving wheel on top of it.

384
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,880
That was where my addiction to peripherals came.

385
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,740
And Donkey Kong Jr. and Kongo Bongo.

386
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,860
Those are the other ones.

387
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Good times.

388
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,260
Two more things for you, Rob.

389
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Venture.

390
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
What was that?

391
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Two more things, Rob.

392
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
All right.

393
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,580
I have a story for you.

394
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,180
This is down in OLR.

395
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,720
This is a serious story.

396
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,260
The first time I listened to you, I'm sorry, but I didn't like it.

397
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,500
And if I wasn't getting locked out of my house, I wouldn't have done this show again.

398
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,060
I wouldn't listen.

399
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,020
What was it you didn't like about the show, out of curiosity?

400
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,940
Believe it or not, I was a huge PSP fan.

401
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,220
The first show I heard was like, oh, Jamie was talking about her puppies.

402
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
Like, shit.

403
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,580
I don't want to listen to a bunch of people talk about Nintendogs.

404
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
I don't have puppies.

405
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,580
No, Nintendogs.

406
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
Oh, my Nintendogs.

407
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Yeah.

408
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
Yeah.

409
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
Remember when that game was the huge fad?

410
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,180
All the five seconds I played that game.

411
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,060
Dude, remember all the hype around Nintendogs?

412
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,520
It was like, seriously, and I contributed to this.

413
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,900
When I played the game at E3, it was one of the best things I saw at the show.

414
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,420
Loke, you in All Out, you bought like three copies of the game.

415
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,540
Why did I do that?

416
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,020
The game lasted five minutes.

417
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,980
It was like a five-minute game, and then it was over.

418
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
It was no replayability.

419
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
It's like I had to constantly take care of these things.

420
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
Fuck this.

421
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,180
The Rob D in chat says Nintendogs still sells a ton.

422
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Go figure.

423
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Wow.

424
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,180
Yeah, if I didn't get locked out of that door with my new wireless router, and then I listened,

425
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,020
and then when you mentioned Nintendogs, aw, that had me again.

426
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
Aw.

427
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
Well, okay.

428
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,220
I'm glad we won you back, and you've definitely brought a lot to the show.

429
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,300
I love you guys now, because I can tell you that I wasn't very happy at first, but with

430
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,740
all the love in my heart, I love you now.

431
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,220
Aw, we appreciate that, Ravenstau.

432
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,700
We love you too.

433
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,420
That makes me feel warm and special.

434
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,620
And she's confused and doesn't know how to take that.

435
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,620
Oh, she drinks.

436
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
One more thing, Ravenstaufen.

437
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,100
I had to go for the alcohol.

438
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Let's hear it, Ravenstaufen.

439
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
One more thing.

440
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,580
You know, you do these live shows all the time, and I'm starting to do live and failing

441
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,700
at it a little bit, but how do you keep, how do you not fail at it?

442
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,860
Like you normally do.

443
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,160
You keep doing it.

444
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
We do fail at it.

445
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
You just don't notice.

446
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,300
Okay, this is my opinion, and this is from doing my show and this too, is that I think

447
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,820
I'm fucking up every episode, okay, but after a while, you know, people are like, oh, that

448
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
was fun, that was fun.

449
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,260
I'm like, it was?

450
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,700
And so you just keep doing it until enough people tell you that it's fine.

451
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,080
For me, and this might be a weird thing to bring up, but some people go to church every

452
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,700
Sunday night, and they make it a habit, and they do it every single week, and I'm not

453
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,860
a religious person, and really my religion is not the listener's business anyway, but

454
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,080
you know, this in a way is kind of that same thing, where it's church.

455
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
This is where we go every week.

456
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,540
We make it a point to sit here and do this, and you know, granted, some weeks we don't

457
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,740
make it, especially as of late.

458
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,340
I don't know if it's senioritis or what.

459
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,380
We've missed a few shows here, and I mean, we were really good.

460
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,260
We were like Bobby for the first hundred episodes.

461
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,020
I don't think we missed a single episode until like in the hundreds somewhere.

462
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
I did.

463
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
Did you?

464
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
I did too.

465
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,620
You missed a lot of shows.

466
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,940
Regardless of that, though, but one of us may be gone one week, but we can still keep

467
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,940
it going.

468
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,420
That's what we've got that Bobby doesn't have, which makes his accomplishment very, very

469
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,740
even more impressive, but you know, I don't know.

470
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,700
You just kind of think of it as this is that hobby you have every Sunday night that you

471
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,040
do.

472
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
But I'll tell you this.

473
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:21,620
I've been listening since you did the part A, part B thing, all of them, every single

474
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
one of them.

475
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,620
I really appreciate it, Ravenstaufen.

476
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
Oh, oh.

477
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
Yeah?

478
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
They want me to say this line.

479
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Should I say it?

480
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
All right.

481
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
Go for it.

482
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
Okay.

483
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,620
It's an inside joke.

484
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
All right.

485
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Thanks, Ravenstaufen.

486
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
We've got to let you go, buddy.

487
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Bye.

488
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Bye.

489
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
Yeah.

490
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
We've got to keep each call to like five minutes.

491
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
It's Loki's turn.

492
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
We've got a lot of calls tonight.

493
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
All right, Loki, you get to answer this call.

494
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Let's see.

495
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,620
Who am I going to let you answer?

496
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
How about this one?

497
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Hey.

498
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,620
Who is this?

499
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Ah.

500
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
It's Airman.

501
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,620
It's a crank call.

502
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Is somebody there?

503
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,620
Hello.

504
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Frickin' crank calls.

505
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
All right.

506
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Loki, you don't get out of it that easy.

507
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,620
You get another call.

508
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
Here you go, Loki.

509
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
You get this call instead.

510
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Ah.

511
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
Loki, you get this one.

512
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,620
I get three calls.

513
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,620
Hi.

514
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,620
This is Orange Lunch Radio.

515
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Who is this?

516
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,620
Hey.

517
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,620
What's up, guys?

518
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,620
It's TheRavdee.

519
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Hey.

520
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
How's it going?

521
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Yo.

522
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,620
Not too shabby.

523
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,620
Got to congratulate you on the 500th episode, obviously.

524
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
Well, thank you.

525
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
Well done.

526
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,620
I'm in the 500th, fifth years, whatever it is.

527
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,620
I'm in the...

528
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
Sorry.

529
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Yeah, 500 would be like the 10-year.

530
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,620
God damn.

531
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,620
If we're still doing this show at 500 episodes, I want a gold watch, for God's sake.

532
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,620
There you go.

533
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,620
But I do have a question for you guys, too, relating to your fifth year.

534
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,620
What's up?

535
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,620
500th episode.

536
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
All right.

537
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,940
What are the most disturbing trends you've seen in gaming, and what is the best trend

538
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,940
you've seen in gaming?

539
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,620
I have an answer for this, but I'll let you guys go first, or if you want to, sometimes

540
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
think home.

541
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,420
The most disturbing trends in gaming?

542
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,420
I would have...

543
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,420
The baby stage of Parappa?

544
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,620
No, I haven't played that, so I don't know.

545
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:05,820
No, I would say probably the most disturbing trend in game is this focus on...

546
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,140
I guess a lot of the games seem to be repeating themselves.

547
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
Sequels.

548
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,460
Too many sequels, or even better, too many fucking spin-off games, like Square.

549
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Let's see.

550
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
Perfect example.

551
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
Final Fantasy VII.

552
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,740
Final Fantasy VII should only be one game.

553
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,860
It's Final Fantasy VII.

554
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,860
We don't need Final Fantasy VII, A, B, C, D, E, so on.

555
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
That's annoying.

556
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:35,900
Also, this whole thing with violent video games and people targeting stuff.

557
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,740
I don't think video games are that much more violent than they were years ago.

558
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,420
It's just the technology has gotten better.

559
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,220
The way that they're displayed is more graphic.

560
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,220
Whatever.

561
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,220
It doesn't matter.

562
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,940
You've got more mainstream, and you've got people finally realizing that games aren't

563
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,940
just for kids.

564
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,260
I attribute it to society getting wimpier.

565
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,340
I think that people are getting more coddled and more...

566
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:07,380
For example, when we were kids, who played tetherball and who had metal jungle gems at

567
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
school?

568
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,380
Yeah, we had that.

569
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,380
Now what are they?

570
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,940
Plastic and no tetherball.

571
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
What the hell?

572
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,420
We used to play dodgeball.

573
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,620
Fuck this tetherball shit.

574
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,620
Even your kids.

575
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,100
Dude, we played smear the queer, which in retrospect is really bad considering how I

576
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,820
turned out.

577
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:32,420
With us as kids, we were raised in the, oh, well, kids got to take their bumps, right?

578
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,580
You're not going to learn not to fall off the swing set if you don't fall off the swing

579
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,940
set and want to find out that the ground is hard.

580
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,620
Now parents are like, oh, we need to protect them from all this, and blah, blah, blah.

581
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,380
Let's raise a society of wimpy asses.

582
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
You know what?

583
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:55,220
Part of being a child is learning, and that's it, is learning.

584
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,940
Part of growing up is finding out what is bad in the world, how it feels to fall down,

585
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,000
and you learn from experience.

586
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,900
You don't learn by just being told, oh, that's bad.

587
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,700
Well, you're not going to believe it.

588
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,820
Okay, how do you think science came about?

589
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,260
How do you think our modern level of technology came about?

590
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,620
It became because someone said, oh, I don't believe you, and tried to disprove it.

591
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,940
Well, that's human nature.

592
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,940
Wow.

593
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,180
That was kind of deep.

594
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:32,180
I was going to say my most disturbing trend is bad ports, Ubisoft, Wii, end of case, EA,

595
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,060
first generation 360 games, there you go.

596
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,860
Bad fucking ports is the most disturbing trend in gaming.

597
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,900
Most Wii games?

598
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,060
Best trend in gaming real quick, and we'll let Rob D give his answers.

599
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,060
Best trend in gaming.

600
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,500
Best trend in gaming.

601
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,180
I would say multiplayer and downloadable content.

602
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:57,500
I have to say bizarre indie games, with the exception of Irritating Stick.

603
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,300
I'm going to give the big three each one, because I do like that the big three each

604
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,020
have something going for them.

605
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,540
Nintendo, innovation and control style.

606
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,940
Say what you will about the Wii being a one-stop shop.

607
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,780
It's really turned a lot of people onto gaming who weren't there before, so yay, Nintendo.

608
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,380
Microsoft, Xbox Live, king of online gaming, undisputed champion.

609
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:25,060
Sony, hard to say so far, but home looks very innovative as well and could be very cool.

610
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,820
Pending on that, but certainly not the brown-eyed judgment, which also would be my runner-up

611
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,700
for worst trend in gaming is cameras.

612
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,740
It's a brilliant idea, but nobody's used it well yet.

613
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Nobody.

614
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,540
Rob D, what do you think?

615
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,740
Well, my best trend in gaming, I'm going to have to agree with Loki and Sky on this one.

616
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,860
Definitely Xbox Live and the rise of online gaming on consoles.

617
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,460
With the online community, I've seen and taken part in the Xbox 360, it's a wonderful thing.

618
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,140
There's just no two ways about it.

619
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,500
I swear to God, I'll be there for Hold'em eventually.

620
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,500
I'll hold you to that, but worst trend in gaming, I actually have to kind of go the

621
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,340
opposite route of Dark Sakura, because I really think that a lot of publishers are being pushed

622
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:16,460
in a direction to squash some games that may or may not sell well or that people, the analysts

623
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,660
may think won't sell well.

624
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,100
On the DS, there are more independent games and there are some companies more willing

625
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,600
to take a chance, but when you see these development costs rising and rising so much on these next

626
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,420
gen systems, a lot of games don't necessarily get to be released.

627
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
That's a shame.

628
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:43,180
All right, well there you have it, so rising development costs, hmm, remember when games

629
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,820
were made by one dude?

630
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,940
Some of those Atari 2600 games were made by one dude and now they're like multi-million

631
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
dollar productions.

632
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,900
They don't have to be, I mean they don't really have to be to be successful games.

633
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,340
That's the thing, people, especially publishers and developers are kind of under this impression

634
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,580
that they need to really push the envelope as far as realism in games and that's not

635
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,940
necessarily the case.

636
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,940
I mean, you don't need to be realistic in order to be a good game.

637
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,140
Black Wolf and Chat, excellent point, Ultima was made by one dude.

638
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,980
Now the original Ultima is for me, excuse me, not that incredible of a game, but the

639
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,460
trend that it started, huge.

640
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,980
So anyway, Rob D...

641
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,780
Remember Adventure on the 2600?

642
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,940
Made by one guy, Warren Robinette, and then he's directed there.

643
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,140
Isn't that phenomenal, Adventure?

644
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,240
Think about how many hours you spend on a game like Adventure, just phenomenal.

645
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,300
Rob D., we've got to wrap it up, let some more people through, but any last thoughts?

646
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,780
Not really, that's all I've got for you guys, thanks for taking my call and I hope you guys

647
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,580
go for another, well, five years if you want to, I should say that, because...

648
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
We'll try our best.

649
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,280
...if you don't want to, then you've got to stop at that point.

650
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,460
And if you want to hear more of the Rob D., as you should, he's a great radio host, you

651
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,340
really do have a voice for Radio Rob D., it's amazing, tdig.allgames.com, check it out.

652
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,340
Exactly.

653
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,340
This day in gaming.

654
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
But I'm done with pimping.

655
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
Enjoy the rest of your show.

656
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,020
All right, have a good one, Rob D., appreciate it.

657
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:12,780
My turn to take a call, let's go, I'm going to go to a telephone call and see how that

658
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
one turns out.

659
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
Let's do this one.

660
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Hi, you're on Orange Hawn's Radio.

661
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
Who's this?

662
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,780
Hey, this is Scott.

663
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
This is Yuri Lover.

664
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Hi, Yuri Lover.

665
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
What's up, Scott?

666
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Hey, good, how are you?

667
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
Hello!

668
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
I'm good.

669
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Hey, Dr. Gary.

670
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
Hey, I'm lucky.

671
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,420
I just want to say congrats on a big five, all right?

672
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Thank you.

673
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
You'll be starting kindergarten soon.

674
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
He's very cute.

675
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
Exactly.

676
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
We got potty trained.

677
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,620
We were in preschool already and now we're this many.

678
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,620
We're this many.

679
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
Wait.

680
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:49,500
Now, oh, all right, did Uncle touch you in the no-no area at all?

681
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Did they?

682
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Did he?

683
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Did he?

684
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:59,340
No, but Loki's been kind of messing with my mind over the past couple years, so I guess

685
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,780
there's that.

686
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Okay.

687
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,820
Talk about games for Christ's sake.

688
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
What do you want to say about games?

689
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
Well, okay.

690
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
I was going to get to that.

691
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:20,100
I was going to get to some great gaming affairs that I know of, EA and Westwood, Maxis, and

692
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:31,140
every other goddamn company bought out by EA, me and your mom last night, Microsoft

693
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:38,260
and Namco, Apple and Nintendo, and OR and GameTaps.

694
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Why do you got a T on me?

695
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Why?

696
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,780
Why do you got a T on me with GameTaps?

697
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,780
Wait.

698
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,740
Oh, well, you know, GameTaps, well, it's just a matter of time before they start buying

699
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,100
it, what they kind of have because they got those independent releases as well, but yeah,

700
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
very interesting.

701
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,180
As with a lot of corporations, you see the big gaming companies kind of merging and merging

702
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,580
and merging.

703
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
What do you think?

704
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,580
I'll pose this question.

705
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:06,340
What do you think has been a great partnership and what do you think has been a bad partnership?

706
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,500
Does anybody want to try and answer this one?

707
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,420
EA and anybody?

708
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,380
Has it been a bad partnership?

709
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
I don't know.

710
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,860
Oh, or a good partnership?

711
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,540
I think that's a bad partnership, yes.

712
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,180
I think they just ruined the Command and Conquer series.

713
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,180
Alright, why?

714
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,540
Oh, I was going to say ruin Command and Conquer?

715
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,980
I think the he who shall not be named and law is a bad combination.

716
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,060
Lord Voldemort and the study of law.

717
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,060
No, he who shall not be named.

718
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,060
No, not Voldemort.

719
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,060
Not Voldemort.

720
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
No.

721
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Just...

722
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,780
No, I'm not going to say it on the air.

723
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:44,780
I would say a bad partnership was Nintendo and Sony.

724
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,220
No, that might have been a good partnership.

725
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,180
Oh my God, the PlayStation one on the net?

726
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Yeah.

727
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,860
If you think about it though, maybe not.

728
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,740
Maybe that was actually a good partnership, because if that hadn't happened, maybe the

729
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,020
PlayStation would have never come out.

730
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,060
The PlayStation and PlayStation 2 certainly have changed the face of gaming, so maybe

731
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,640
that was actually a good partnership.

732
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,260
Maybe that's not fair for me to say.

733
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,700
How about this, bad partnership, bad, bad, bad, bad, what the fuck were you thinking

734
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
of partnership?

735
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,700
Phillips, CDI, and Nintendo.

736
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
There you go. Everybody can agree that was bad.

737
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Or what was it that, um...

738
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,700
No, it was the CDI that was playing Sega CD games, wasn't it?

739
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Um, no. See, I don't think the CDI ever played Sega CD games.

740
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,700
It was one of those offshoot ones.

741
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,700
Um, what about a good partnership?

742
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,700
I can tell you one, I think, if it ever happened.

743
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,700
Sega and Microsoft with the original Xbox.

744
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Uh, how there were rumors going around that the Dreamcast was going to be on the Xbox?

745
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,700
Or the Dreamcast games were going to be playable?

746
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Uh-huh.

747
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,700
They made it, well, in different ways.

748
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,700
I would have loved to have, like, guitar hero or popping music on my Xbox or something.

749
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,700
I would say a good partnership has been Square and Enix.

750
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,700
I think a lot of people had a lot to fear from that merger.

751
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
But, um, you know, the momentum hasn't really stopped.

752
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,700
And there's been a lot of really good games that have come out of those companies.

753
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,700
Uh, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest VIII, you know, we're still seeing a lot of good stuff.

754
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,700
Granted, Loki's problem with sequels, you know, they do have that problem.

755
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,700
The laser interactive, that's what it was, sorry.

756
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Bad partnerships so far, at least.

757
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Konami and Hudson, actually.

758
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,700
Because, to be honest, Hudson, everything from that division has really sucked lately.

759
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Uh, Bomberman, you know, Act Zero, uh...

760
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
That game doesn't exist in my universe.

761
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
You know, uh, I don't know.

762
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Hudson, I mean, they've got some good things going for them, but I know they love Bomberman.

763
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,700
Okay, great. But let's get past Bomberman.

764
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Let that series take a rest for a few years, you know?

765
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,700
You don't need to release a new Bomberman title every fucking year.

766
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Well, the Xbox Live Arcade one looks pretty good. I'll let them have that.

767
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Well, hey, how about positivity? What about the good partnerships?

768
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
Square Enix.

769
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Well, yeah. I actually, um, was going to say, um...

770
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,700
This is an old one, but Bleem and Sega.

771
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Even though Sega didn't really have any authority over it, Bleemcast.

772
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Good times. You got playing the PlayStation games on the Dreamcast?

773
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,700
It was only certain ones, but I was, keep in mind, I am the biggest Tekken fangirl ever,

774
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,700
and Tekken 3 on Bleemcast was, like, better than the arcade. It was beautiful.

775
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:38,700
I was like, hell yeah, take me now.

776
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:44,700
All right, Yuri Lever, what about you? Anything you want to add to this?

777
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Um, not really, but I just want to say congrats again.

778
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:57,700
My parents are sort of getting pissed off right now because I'm talking on the phone to total strangers, what they think.

779
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
They don't give a stranger than Rob.

780
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,700
All right. Well, we're sorry, Mom, and we're sorry, Dad, and yeah, so we'll have a good one.

781
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Oh, don't worry. It's my dad's birthday. He'll just get pissed off tomorrow.

782
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Well, he's got a good birthday, then. Happy birthday.

783
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,700
All right.

784
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,700
Yeah.

785
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,700
All right, we'll see you later, Yuri Lever. Have a good one.

786
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Wait, one more thing.

787
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Do your parents know you're a Yuri Lever?

788
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
They don't know what it means.

789
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700
Oh, I get it. Okay, never mind. One more thing, yes.

790
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
It just means that you like snow.

791
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,700
No, not snow. You like lilies.

792
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Let him have his one more thing, yes.

793
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Res trans vibrator.

794
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,700
Best peripheral ever, res trans vibrator.

795
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Yeah, it is.

796
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
Until three feel comes out, yes.

797
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
All true.

798
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,700
All right. See you later, Yuri Lever. Thanks for the call. Have a good one.

799
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
All right.

800
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Hey, Rob, before we take a call, I have to tell you about something that someone reminded me of in the chat room.

801
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
What's that?

802
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,700
I found a YouTube video of someone using the Mugen emulator to put the R-type ship into Super Mario Brothers.

803
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
That's awesome.

804
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,700
And played through the first level of Super Mario Brothers with the ship from R-type.

805
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
That's awesome.

806
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
Anyway, I'm going to answer this one.

807
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
Let's do some more calls. Are you going to do email bag tonight?

808
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Yeah, I am, but I need to answer this.

809
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Let's do some more calls. All right, we'll let you take a call here.

810
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,700
What?

811
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
Hi.

812
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Hi.

813
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,700
I fear the Jamie. This is Junami.

814
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,700
I know.

815
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Hi.

816
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,700
You don't sound like yourself.

817
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
How are you?

818
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,700
Maybe because you screamed in his ear. I don't know.

819
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,700
Yeah, I think that was it.

820
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
What do you want?

821
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
I'm just saying hi and happy fucking birthday.

822
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Yeah, we're going to SacAnime, right?

823
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Yeah, we are.

824
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
When is that again?

825
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,700
That is middle of July. I believe it's July 14th and 15th.

826
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,700
We are so there.

827
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
SacAnime.com.

828
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
You're going to cosplay with me, right?

829
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I might if I can.

830
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Nerds.

831
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Fucking nerds.

832
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Hey, Rob, you know what?

833
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Do we ever get a panel on that?

834
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
I don't know.

835
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
Explicit was looking into it for us.

836
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,700
To do a panel at SacAnime.

837
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700
So what do you want?

838
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
Somewhere in the basement of the Scottish Rite.

839
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700
You've got to have a topic.

840
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
I'll give you a topic.

841
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,700
Gothic architecture is neither Gothic nor architecture.

842
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,700
Discuss.

843
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
I don't have any arches. I have flat feet.

844
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,700
Drew, you've been a longtime listener of Orange Lounge Radio.

845
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Yeah.

846
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,700
Best thing that ever happened on this program?

847
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,700
I'd have to say episode 69.

848
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,700
I feel bad because Jamie wasn't there for that.

849
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Is that the weekend I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room?

850
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
Why do you think it was the best moment?

851
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Oh, shit.

852
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
What?

853
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
Did you hear what Drew said?

854
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,700
He said, why do you think it was the best one?

855
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I know where you live.

856
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Yes, you do.

857
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
Maybe you could give me a ride home?

858
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Okay.

859
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
No.

860
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,700
That's the story behind episode 69.

861
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Jamie was gone for a week, and our friend Janae came on the program.

862
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:58,700
And Janae was having fun with it because she thought it was a phone sex line.

863
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,700
And the fact that it was episode 69 didn't help any.

864
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,700
So it was episode 69, and that's when Karaoke Revolution, the very first one, was brand new.

865
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,700
And back in the day, we used to fuck off so bad on the program.

866
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
We didn't have these set topics.

867
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,700
I mean, every program was kind of like tonight in a way.

868
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
It was the three-hour tour.

869
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Exactly.

870
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
And it's so weird how we've become organized since then.

871
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
Wait, wait, wait.

872
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
We're organized?

873
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Yeah, somewhat.

874
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,700
When did this come about?

875
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Karaoke Revolution got broken out.

876
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Loki gave his most infamous performance that in some ways has scared him off from ever

877
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
doing karaoke again.

878
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,700
So I asked Loki, is episode 69 to blame for your fear of karaoke?

879
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I just hate karaoke, and I don't know why I didn't.

880
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,700
You made me do it last time.

881
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,700
Karaoke hates you.

882
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,700
I told him he was kicked out of the apartment if you wouldn't do karaoke or something.

883
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,700
I don't know what I wrote it with.

884
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
I did it twice.

885
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,700
We're going to pick the song at random.

886
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Great.

887
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,700
And then, of course, he changed the lyrics to I'm Coming Out to I'm Staying In, I Like

888
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
the Pussy, or something like that.

889
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,700
It was so frickin' funny, we were peeing ourselves laughing.

890
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
It wasn't that fun.

891
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,700
I'm sure there's a bootleg clip floating around somewhere.

892
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,700
That's what I need to send to Scott for the all-game soundboard.

893
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
I've got the MP3s.

894
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Do you?

895
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,700
But I'm not sharing.

896
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Alright, Drew, we had milkshakes.

897
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,700
I believe that was the episode that milkshake won the cage match.

898
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
I've got to run for just a minute because the food's here.

899
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Matt, please take over, Jamie.

900
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Food!

901
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
I know, God.

902
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
I could really use some pizza right now.

903
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,700
I've got pizza.

904
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,700
I don't give me pizza because I'm on the floor.

905
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
Haha!

906
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Floor for you!

907
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
No pizza!

908
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Wait, it was Loki on the floor that time.

909
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,700
Dude, okay.

910
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,700
I think that we should have the official Orange Mountains Radio BBQ.

911
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Yeah, that would be a good idea.

912
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
At my house.

913
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,700
Glad I thought of it.

914
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,700
I am not high.

915
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
No, you're drunk.

916
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Damn, I am not high.

917
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,700
I'm just me.

918
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,700
You're drunk.

919
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Okay, fine, I'm drunk.

920
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
You got me.

921
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Just because I have corrupted you.

922
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,700
I have good beer this time.

923
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
What do you have?

924
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Tell me what you're drinking.

925
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,700
I have arrogant bastard IPA.

926
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Not bad, however, I can do you better.

927
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,700
I've got Guinness in the fridge at home.

928
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
And I'm never buying cheap champagne again.

929
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,700
Oh my God, this stuff went right to my head.

930
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,700
Should I mill you some waffles?

931
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,700
No, damn it, I don't need waffles.

932
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Waffles, waffles.

933
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,700
I paid you back your waffles, didn't I?

934
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,700
Yeah, a long time ago.

935
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,700
Okay, I forgot.

936
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,700
Rodney Sabrina's our pizza.

937
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,700
Waffles.

938
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,700
Dude, I could actually go for waffles instead.

939
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
I could go for pancakes right now, okay?

940
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,700
So, okay, tell us something relevant.

941
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Like, talk about what do you think in the past five years of our show

942
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,700
you think the best game release has been?

943
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,700
The most innovative, game of the year type game?

944
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Katamari Dimashti.

945
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
Why do you feel this?

946
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,700
No contest.

947
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Food!

948
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Oh my God, food.

949
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,700
Okay, I'm not talking to you anymore, there's food here.

950
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,700
I see how it is, I see where your priorities are.

951
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:25,700
Alright, anyway, what's hilarious is I took the excess furniture out of here for tonight's show,

952
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,700
so I put the pizza on the floor, so Jamie is scurrying to the floor to grab the food.

953
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
Watch it be the wrong pizza.

954
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Hey, they give you coupons? They never give me coupons.

955
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
I know, I'm special.

956
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Now everyone is on the floor for pizza, it reminds me of number 29.

957
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,700
Alright, Drew, we gotta let you go, because we have a bunch of other calls coming in.

958
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
Alright, later dude.

959
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
Oh no, vagina puppies!

960
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Shut up, bye.

961
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Objection!

962
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,700
What a nerd.

963
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
Alright, who's answering this call? Loki, it's your turn, right?

964
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Yes.

965
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Alright, then answer this one.

966
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,700
Hello vacuum cleaner, how's it going?

967
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,700
Holy shit, what's that?

968
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,700
I don't want to know.

969
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
That was not good.

970
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
I don't want to know what they're doing.

971
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Whoever just called us, please give us a call back a little later,

972
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,700
when you've called echo 123 is what you want to call,

973
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,700
to always make sure that your internet connection is working.

974
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,700
And cleaned up.

975
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,700
You don't sound like a vacuum cleaner.

976
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
No problem, it happens dude, no problem.

977
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,700
Alright, Loki, how about you try this one instead?

978
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,700
Okay, hello, who is this?

979
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,700
Hello, this is Insanist reporting live from Duck Island.

980
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Duck Island?

981
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,700
How's it going?

982
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,700
It's going well, congratulations on five years guys.

983
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,700
Thank you.

984
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,700
I'm going to celebrate by taking pizza.

985
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,700
What the crap is Duck Island?

986
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,700
You don't remember that?

987
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,700
No.

988
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:59,700
Okay, remember the show where I was absolutely on a drunken rampage in the chat room?

989
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,700
Oh yeah, okay, now I remember, I do.

990
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,700
And a certain individual, who will not be named Rob,

991
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,700
asked if I've ever been to Duck Island.

992
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,700
And I responded with, your mom goes to Duck Island,

993
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,700
and Rob laughed like a silly little girl.

994
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,700
Yeah, I know, I do that sometimes.

995
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,700
What do you want to talk to us about?

996
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:28,700
Well, you guys were talking about good ideas like with companies merging or working together.

997
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,700
You guys missed a really obvious one, harmonics and red octane.

998
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,700
With the whole guitar hero thing.

999
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,700
I mean, honestly, that's probably been one of the biggest game franchises in the past two years.

1000
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,700
You're getting a little quieter, put your mouth closer to the microphone.

1001
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,700
But yes, dude, you're right, it's really been one of the first partnerships to give Konami a run for its money too.

1002
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,700
And you know what, competition in some ways is a good thing, honestly.

1003
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
Yeah, is this better?

1004
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,700
Yes, much better.

1005
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Okay.

1006
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,700
I was just calling to say congratulations on five years, here's to five more.

1007
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:12,700
I hope my show lasts five months.

1008
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Well, how long has your show been going?

1009
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Now, you're starting this new show, right?

1010
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,700
It's going to be episode four this week.

1011
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,700
Good job, and what do you talk about on your show?

1012
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,700
We talk about absolutely nothing, so it's pretty much like your show was back in the day I would take it.

1013
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Good times, I'm glad somebody's picking up the slack.

1014
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,700
Yeah, I have to because I'm the big retarded kid of Orange Lounge Radio.

1015
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:44,700
All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1016
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,700
Not anything that would get me fired.

1017
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,700
All right, good times.

1018
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,700
All right, I love you guys.

1019
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,700
I love you too, DMN.

1020
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,700
Don't get too drunk.

1021
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,700
We'll try.

1022
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,700
All right, later.

1023
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,700
All right, have a good one, DMN.

1024
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,700
Speaking of, DMN brings up a good point I want to ask you guys about really quick.

1025
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,700
What do you think have been some of the best guests we've ever had on Orange Lounge Radio?

1026
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Because, you know, DMN was here once.

1027
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
We've had a lot of people in and out of this house.

1028
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,700
What do you guys think were some of the best guests we've ever had on the program?

1029
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Abe Lincoln.

1030
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,700
Me and my ego.

1031
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,700
No, my favorite guest ever has been Sauce.

1032
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,700
And the lesbians.

1033
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,700
I think the lesbians have been some of the best guests we've ever had.

1034
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Sauce is the best guest.

1035
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,700
We have a lot of good women that come on the show, nothing against the men.

1036
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,700
I have to say the top three have been Tiara and Kristen and Megzi.

1037
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,700
Awesome times.

1038
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,700
We're going to go back to the phones and pick up another call.

1039
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,700
And Warrior Bob.

1040
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,700
He was very good.

1041
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,700
He was very recent.

1042
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
He had a very good radio voice.

1043
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,700
He was very good.

1044
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,700
Awesome.

1045
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,700
All right, well, let's go to the phone lines and take another call.

1046
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,700
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1047
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
Who's this?

1048
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,700
Hey, this is Scott.

1049
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700
How are you guys doing?

1050
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
Congratulations on five years.

1051
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Hi.

1052
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,700
This is Scott from All Games.

1053
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,700
Well, you know, I've been listening to the show and I've been hearing a lot of people

1054
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,700
who seem to just be calling in to wishing you congratulations just to plug their podcast.

1055
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,700
I don't really want to mention where I'm from.

1056
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,700
I just want to make this about you.

1057
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,700
Every call is like, hey, I do a podcast.

1058
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,700
Hey, I want to give a shout out on my podcast.

1059
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,700
You know what?

1060
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,700
This is about you three and this show and it doesn't matter what I do or where I come

1061
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
from, okay?

1062
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Well, I appreciate that, but isn't it funny?

1063
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
Hey, there's the best guest on our show right there.

1064
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
Scott.

1065
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,700
Oh, you liked having Scott on our show at 83.

1066
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,700
That's cool.

1067
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:39,700
Yeah, because Scott dished the dirt on G4 big time on our program.

1068
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
I did.

1069
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,700
That was awesome.

1070
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,700
True.

1071
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,700
Not a friendly relationship there anymore, it seems.

1072
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,700
I only got two letters from attorneys after that appearance.

1073
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:55,700
So apparently, Orange Lounge Radio not only feeds information about games not released,

1074
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,700
but it feeds information to legal counsel over at G4.

1075
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,700
I would know nothing about that, sir.

1076
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,700
Well, I'm asking you because we're just kind of talking about random stuff in gaming, kind

1077
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,700
of the gaming scene is that you kind of bring up a good point that everybody and their brother

1078
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,700
and sister have a podcast in this day and age because you're right.

1079
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,700
A lot of people have been calling in and plugging their stuff, which is fine.

1080
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,700
We're all about promoting the indie podcast and I know you guys at All Games are really

1081
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:25,700
big on that, but what do you think can really help a podcast kind of like distinguish itself

1082
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,700
amongst all the rest out there?

1083
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,700
I mean, do something that no one else is doing and usually that will work when you're doing

1084
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,700
something that you're passionate about.

1085
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,700
I think you guys hit it on the head when you started out being about Banami because that

1086
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,700
was what you were passionate about.

1087
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,700
But as you got more comfortable doing your shows, you kind of showed everyone that, hey,

1088
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,700
not only are we passionate about that, but we're passionate about a lot of other things

1089
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,700
and that's how you kind of expand your show and you get to talk about more varied things.

1090
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,700
But I think to start out, you got to start out with something that you're passionate

1091
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,700
about and something that no one else is talking about.

1092
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,700
If you happen to be into the same stuff that everybody else is into, you can still do it,

1093
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,700
but try and come at it from a different angle.

1094
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,700
Very good.

1095
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,700
Do something different with it.

1096
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,700
Good point.

1097
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,700
You got to do something to kind of distinguish yourself amongst all the others if you want

1098
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,700
to kind of get noticed, I suppose.

1099
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,700
Right.

1100
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,700
Go ahead.

1101
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,700
Well, no, I had a couple of toasts I wanted to give to you guys.

1102
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,700
I don't know if you want me to wait for that.

1103
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,700
No, go for it.

1104
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,700
I've got my champagne glass in my hand.

1105
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,700
Go for it.

1106
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,700
I drank all my booze already, so here's some Coke.

1107
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,700
All right.

1108
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,700
What's the toast?

1109
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Okay.

1110
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
Do a line up with the guys back if you're doing Coke.

1111
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Okay.

1112
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Being a podcaster, I know that you guys, just like we, don't always get respect from

1113
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,700
people in the industry, so this first toast addresses that.

1114
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,700
Here's to the game developers we love.

1115
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,700
Here's to the game developers who love us.

1116
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,700
The developers we love will never love us, so fuck those developers, and here's to us.

1117
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,700
All right.

1118
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,700
Good call.

1119
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
I like that one.

1120
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,700
That was great.

1121
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Okay.

1122
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,700
And then I have a little haiku, because I know how much you love haiku.

1123
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:04,700
I do love haikus.

1124
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,700
I love haikus.

1125
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,700
Okay.

1126
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,700
Here we go.

1127
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,700
And I hope I don't screw this up, because usually Skye corrects my...

1128
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,700
It's 575, Scott, 575.

1129
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,700
Thank you.

1130
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:22,700
Loki Jamie Skye, a Sunday night tradition.

1131
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,700
Lesbians are hot.

1132
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,700
I'll drink to that.

1133
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,700
All right, we'll toast to that.

1134
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,700
Lesbians are indeed hot.

1135
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,700
I might be gay, but I love my lesbians.

1136
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,700
I'll save my last one for right before I hang out.

1137
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,700
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me, or can I just give you guys some more love?

1138
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,700
I do.

1139
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,700
Well, really, really quick, I just want to ask you a question, because I know a lot of

1140
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,700
folks kind of know you as that guy that was on G4 a long time ago and all that stuff,

1141
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:56,700
but I kind of rely on that experience that you've had kind of at the far end of this

1142
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,700
industry, kind of where gaming media can go, kind of like all the way to the top, so to

1143
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
speak.

1144
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:09,700
I kind of ask, is it possible that gaming can ever substantiate that type of media again?

1145
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,700
Will we ever have a true gaming channel in the future, in the next five years, do you

1146
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,700
think?

1147
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:20,700
I think the problem is that it's going to be difficult for anyone to sustain a channel.

1148
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,700
It doesn't matter if it's games or anything else.

1149
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,700
I mean, if you look at what's happening now as everything moves to the Internet, IPTV

1150
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:34,700
and broadband and Fios, and if you look at game trailers and IGN and GameSpot, they're

1151
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,700
essentially networks about games.

1152
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,700
They're just done in a way that this, I think, audience wants to consume it.

1153
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:47,700
The problem with a regular television channel is that people aren't watching regular television

1154
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,700
anymore, especially gamers.

1155
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,700
They're getting all their content online.

1156
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:56,700
They're getting it when they want it, how they want it, and the model for reaching that

1157
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,700
audience just may not be the traditional cable TV model.

1158
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:06,700
If you notice what Spike TV and what G4 has done is they're casting their net to this

1159
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:15,700
wider demographic because I think that once you try to just get gamers on a TV level,

1160
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,700
there's a belief, not necessarily that it's true, but there's a belief by both the ad

1161
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:26,700
community and the executives in television that that group, the gamer group, isn't big

1162
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,700
enough.

1163
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:33,700
You know and I know there's 150 million Americans and 800 million gamers around the world, but

1164
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,700
I think when someone doesn't understand games and they don't know games and they don't play

1165
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:43,700
games, it's difficult for them to believe that the audience is there and that it's big

1166
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,700
enough to support a big television network.

1167
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,700
I think the way it's going to happen is it's going to be online.

1168
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,700
I don't think we'll ever see a traditional television network that's ad supported doing

1169
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:58,700
it because I just don't think that within the age of 500 channels that there's enough.

1170
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:03,700
Now, subscription maybe, like Gameplay HD and Voom, I believe that if they're committed

1171
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:09,700
to keeping that channel a subscription as part of an overall, not an individual subscription,

1172
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,700
but an overall HD package, that channel should succeed because, again, it's not reliant on

1173
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,700
viewers and ratings.

1174
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:24,700
It's reliant on the overall company, Rainbow Media and Voom, being committed to niche programming

1175
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,700
on HD satellites.

1176
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,700
I think Gameplay HD is the best chance for a major network.

1177
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,700
It just actually got picked up by Cablevision, so we don't have this network.

1178
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,700
Cablevision now carrying it as well.

1179
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,700
Very good.

1180
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,700
So it's Gameplay HD or it's YouTube for the rest of us?

1181
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,700
Pretty much.

1182
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,700
All right.

1183
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,700
Anything else you want to share with us?

1184
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:49,700
There's always all games because today audio, tomorrow video, we're working on getting our

1185
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:54,700
own location and we'll be doing video every day as soon as we get that place up and running.

1186
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,700
Of course, I'm very excited for the day that you guys all come down to our place and christen

1187
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:06,700
the new location because as the ashes of Arena fall, so will a new event rise in the heart

1188
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
of Hollywood with all games.

1189
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,700
Awesome.

1190
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,700
Wow.

1191
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,700
You sound like you spent a couple hours writing that tagline.

1192
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,700
I was going to say, going back to what he said earlier about G4 expanding their audience,

1193
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,700
I always thought it was more of a polite way of saying they're actually digging through

1194
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,700
this syndication dumpster and picking up anything they can that fills space.

1195
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,700
It's funny seeing a station like that not so dedicated to games still getting invited

1196
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,700
to E3.

1197
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,700
Well, I'm sure Scott's sick of hearing about G4.

1198
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,700
It's not even about them getting invited.

1199
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,700
It's about them spending money to try and appease the few gaming audience members they

1200
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,700
have left.

1201
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,700
They basically siphoned up all the money they were spending on games.

1202
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:54,700
They got it down to X-Play and a little bit of Attack of the Show and a Cinematheque ripoff

1203
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,700
thing.

1204
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,700
Really, it's not about E3 letting them in.

1205
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:04,700
It's about G4 trying to keep those gamers because, let's face it, I know it, you know

1206
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,700
it, the majority of people that still watch G4, even though it's a very small slice of

1207
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,700
people in the world of cable, it's still the gamers.

1208
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,700
Nobody is showing up for cops and cheaters and all that crap.

1209
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,700
I don't know, I show up for cheaters.

1210
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,700
It's all about the few remaining gamers who are holding out that maybe someday they'll

1211
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,700
be a resurgent, but it's not going to happen.

1212
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:31,700
Their E3 coverage will probably be okay because they'll have Geoff Keighley and Adam and

1213
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,700
Morgan, but that's about it.

1214
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,700
And then lots of women in bikinis.

1215
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,700
There it is, because that's what gamers really want.

1216
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,700
That's what gamers and 12-year-old boys really want.

1217
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,700
Scott, we've got to get to some more calls.

1218
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,700
We really appreciate you calling in and everything that you do with AllGames.com and supporting

1219
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,700
the independent broadcast.

1220
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,700
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1221
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,700
Scott Siegel I want to say that, like you guys have already

1222
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,700
laid out for people, this is not about a money-making thing.

1223
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,700
It's not about trying to be the leader in podcasting because, let's face it, it's

1224
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,700
a very fragmented industry and it's difficult to stand out.

1225
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,700
The only thing that can allow you to stand out in podcasting is your passion.

1226
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,700
When your passion shines through to the audience, they will show up, they will reward you, not

1227
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,700
with money and riches, but they will reward you with the audience.

1228
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,700
Your words only work if people are there to hear them.

1229
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:30,700
Whether it's 15 or 500, there are clearly people that love Orange Lounge Radio and they're

1230
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,700
the fuel that keeps it running.

1231
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:39,700
It's an inspiration not only to the people that are trying to do podcasting right now

1232
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,700
but to people like me because you are the spirit of why I started doing it in the first

1233
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,700
place.

1234
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,700
I close with this.

1235
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,700
Scott, you're very opinionated.

1236
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,700
All three of you all have your own opinions about gaming.

1237
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,700
I love having you on our show and I love being on your show to debate, so I close with this.

1238
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,700
Here's to you and here's to me.

1239
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,700
Podcast friends will always be.

1240
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,700
Shall we ever disagree?

1241
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,700
Then fuck you all and here's to me.

1242
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,700
Happy anniversary, guys.

1243
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:09,700
Very well said, thank you so much, Scott.

1244
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,700
Take care, buddy.

1245
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,700
We always enjoy having Scott on the program.

1246
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,700
He's good stuff.

1247
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,700
Good stuff.

1248
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,700
That was great.

1249
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,700
You never know who you're going to hear from here on the call-ins here on Orange Lounge.

1250
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,700
See, I really wish we lived closer to them.

1251
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,700
I know.

1252
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,700
It's a six-hour drive to get down there, but we're going to go.

1253
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,700
I've heard rumblings about what they've got planned and it sounds pretty exciting.

1254
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,700
I'm pretty excited.

1255
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,700
More calls?

1256
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,700
I'm still trying to work to go to E4ALL.

1257
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,700
Why not?

1258
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,700
Or E3.

1259
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,700
Or I could do something.

1260
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,700
Jamie, how about one more call?

1261
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,700
Then you can.

1262
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,700
Hi.

1263
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,700
Take this call, Jamie.

1264
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,700
Hi.

1265
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,700
Whoever you are.

1266
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,700
Hey.

1267
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,700
What?

1268
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,700
Dude, the Hulk is calling.

1269
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
Hello?

1270
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,700
What?

1271
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,700
Hello?

1272
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,700
Hey, it's Satan.

1273
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,700
Cool.

1274
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,700
Well, hi, Satan.

1275
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,700
Hey, boss.

1276
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,700
What's on your mind, Satan?

1277
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,700
Guess what?

1278
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:55,700
What?

1279
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,700
What?

1280
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,700
Your five years are up.

1281
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:02,700
Your soul is mine now, bitches.

1282
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,700
I had a full refund.

1283
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,700
Sorry.

1284
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,700
You know, you signed the contract.

1285
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,700
Your soul is mine.

1286
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,900
You'll have to talk to your secretary about that one because, you know, that Judas does

1287
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,700
not know how to keep his paperwork straight.

1288
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,700
Okay, don't give me any of this in-line, legally bullshit.

1289
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,700
Your signature is on paper.

1290
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,700
It's in blood.

1291
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,700
Your soul is mine.

1292
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,700
Didn't you read the small print?

1293
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:31,700
Dude, I have an addendum to that that's also signed in blood that said that I can get my

1294
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:36,700
soul back by certain means, and I've taken this means, so aha, welcome to the modern

1295
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,700
era.

1296
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,100
Satan, let's suppose you do get our souls.

1297
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,800
And I'll have to sue you for appeals court anyway.

1298
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,700
For the fact that we've actually managed to do this show for five years.

1299
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,700
Satan, what exactly do you have planned for our souls?

1300
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Well, Loki, new job, my right-hand man.

1301
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,700
I need somebody with attitude and balls who doesn't give a shit.

1302
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,700
Good job, Loki.

1303
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,900
Yeah, but you saw the way that Namco made him cry like a little bitch.

1304
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,500
I mean, do you really want someone like that working for you?

1305
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:09,900
Now with the power of the almighty evil that is me behind him, nothing will stand in his

1306
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
way.

1307
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
Not even a big ball of katamari.

1308
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,900
All right, we got you.

1309
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,900
And so you, Jamie.

1310
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,900
Yes?

1311
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:25,900
You will be forced to watch the series finale of SG-1 over and over and over again.

1312
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,900
Because thank you to me, it blew balls.

1313
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,400
But I'm Wiccan and don't believe in you.

1314
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,900
And Richard Dean Anderson's not in it, so what are you going to do?

1315
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
There's always a start for something.

1316
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,900
End of Rob.

1317
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,900
Uh-oh.

1318
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,900
My dear, dear Rob.

1319
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:43,900
Yes?

1320
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,900
Guess what?

1321
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,900
What?

1322
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,900
Time to up the ass for you, bitch.

1323
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,900
Wait, am I supposed to be your lover like Saddam Hussein?

1324
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,900
I don't know about that.

1325
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,900
I don't really want that, sir.

1326
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:01,900
You know, it's just the money I can make on pay-per-view by showing somebody sticking

1327
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,900
a pineapple up your ass.

1328
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,900
That might hurt a bit, Satan.

1329
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:06,900
I don't know about that.

1330
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
I don't know if I could stomach that.

1331
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,900
I will rake it in.

1332
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,900
Thank you for giving this show an explicit tag, Satan.

1333
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,900
I really appreciate that.

1334
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,900
Hey, that's my job.

1335
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:24,900
I am here to lower the moral values of all programs I come in contact with.

1336
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,900
I forgot.

1337
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,900
You invented all that is explicit.

1338
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:33,900
Satan, you've been listening to this show, obviously, for a while, waiting for this day

1339
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,900
to come.

1340
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,900
What have you thought?

1341
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,900
Hello?

1342
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,900
What have you thought about the five years of Orange Lounge Radio?

1343
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:46,900
Well, all I have to say is thank God for custom-made earplugs.

1344
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,900
That's kind of messed up, Satan.

1345
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
I mean, isn't there anything on the show you enjoy?

1346
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,900
The pain, the pain, the pain.

1347
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:59,900
U.S. Hilton is having more fun bouncing off the walls of her cell than anybody listening

1348
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,900
to you.

1349
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,900
You're a real jerk, Satan, and I'm about to hang up on you.

1350
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,900
Oh, come on.

1351
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,900
You love me.

1352
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,900
That's why you signed the damn contract.

1353
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,900
But you promised me Dunkin' Donuts.

1354
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,900
Anything else, Satan, that you want to add tonight?

1355
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,900
Let me think.

1356
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:28,900
Satan, you're a real asshole, you know that?

1357
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,900
Oh, he hung up.

1358
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,900
Satan hung up.

1359
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,900
Satan, you're a pig fucker.

1360
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,900
Let's go to another call.

1361
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,900
That was brilliant.

1362
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,900
Loki, this one's yours.

1363
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,900
Hello?

1364
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,900
Who is this?

1365
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,900
Hello?

1366
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:46,900
Hello?

1367
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,900
Who is this?

1368
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,900
How's it going?

1369
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,900
Hello?

1370
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,900
Hello?

1371
00:58:55,900 --> 00:59:03,900
God damn, do you know how many edits I'm going to have to do on tonight's show because people

1372
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,900
can't get their phones to work or whatever it is?

1373
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,900
That's all right.

1374
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,900
We forgive you.

1375
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,900
Let's go to another call instead.

1376
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,900
Loki, this one's yours.

1377
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,900
Hello?

1378
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Who is this?

1379
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,900
Hello?

1380
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,900
It's Legend of Zaku.

1381
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,900
How's it going, Zaku?

1382
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,900
Oh, pretty good.

1383
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,900
Where's Scott?

1384
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,900
Where's Scott?

1385
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,900
Scott?

1386
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,900
Skye or Scott?

1387
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,900
Scott hung up a while ago.

1388
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,900
Skye's right here with an apple pizza.

1389
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,900
No, Rob.

1390
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,900
No, hi.

1391
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:30,900
What did I just say?

1392
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,900
Just congratulating you on five years, that's all.

1393
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,900
Well, don't just congratulate me.

1394
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,900
I didn't do this by myself.

1395
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,900
Yeah, on everyone else, the whole RLR gang, pretty much.

1396
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,900
Yeah, I'm just trying to wrestle, trying to get this broken monitor to work.

1397
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:50,900
But yeah, a lot of things have been going on, like that whole Manhunt 2 thing, which

1398
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:54,900
I don't even know why.

1399
00:59:54,900 --> 01:00:02,900
It's just that Rockstar, I kind of feel like they're actually pushing it too far.

1400
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,900
I mean, I don't know.

1401
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,900
I mean, I'm all for violence and everything, but I mean-

1402
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,900
I'm really for violence.

1403
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,900
Yeah, you have to draw a line somewhere.

1404
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,900
You can't go.

1405
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,900
You can't be that.

1406
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,900
You can't be too violent.

1407
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:19,900
Yeah, but if I want to, I mean, this country was founded on freedom of speech and freedom

1408
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,900
of expression and freedom of art.

1409
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,900
If I want to do it, shouldn't I be able to do it?

1410
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:28,900
Yeah, but you also have to understand, you can do it, but you're going to have to face

1411
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,900
whatever reaction comes back.

1412
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,900
That's basically, you have to face the consequence of your own actions.

1413
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,900
And that consequence is people thinking you're bad ass.

1414
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:42,900
Like if you call somebody a racial slur, even though you have the free speech to do it,

1415
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,900
that's not going to stop you from getting your ass kicked.

1416
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:49,900
Yes, but that's different because that's when you are inflicting that upon someone else

1417
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,900
unwillingly, and you're violating their rights.

1418
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,900
I do not have that.

1419
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,900
I think it's more the difference between having the legal freedom to do something and having

1420
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,900
the moral freedom to do something.

1421
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:06,900
Yeah, I guess it's kind of both are intertwined, basically, even though they have the legal

1422
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:13,900
right to do it, it's just, you know, obviously Nintendo or Sony or no other carrier might

1423
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:18,900
even pick that one up, maybe on PC after the whole Delta Only thing.

1424
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:26,900
But yeah, I mean, Rockstar, they have to really learn how to, I don't know, just try to be

1425
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:33,900
violent, but even though you have to maintain a level, you have to maintain a level of,

1426
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,900
I can't find the right words to finish it off with.

1427
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,900
Dude, can't we all, I mean, can't we all just get along?

1428
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:47,900
Like, can't we just kind of like sit around and have some munchies and some Doritos?

1429
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:54,900
But yeah, the important thing is that even though it got to go only once it's toned down

1430
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,900
and shit, we'll sell them so crazy.

1431
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:57,900
I'll tell you that.

1432
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,900
All right.

1433
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
Zaku, you've been a long time listener of the show.

1434
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,900
I know you've been listening ever since our Bamani days when we were exclusively talking

1435
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:04,900
about DDR.

1436
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:10,900
What do you think has been the biggest story in the Bamani world that we've ever covered?

1437
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,900
I'm not sure.

1438
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:25,900
It's going to be the whole supernova thing.

1439
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,900
I managed to get first dibs on it in this country.

1440
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,900
Did I hear some water boiling or some bubbles blowing in the background there?

1441
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:40,900
No, anyway, yeah, definitely supernova coming back after such a long absence of DDR extreme,

1442
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,900
and then there was nothing, and then finally for supernova to come back kind of really

1443
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,900
great at us all.

1444
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,900
And of course, Loki will be the first to tell you that he was one of the first five people

1445
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,900
in America to play it.

1446
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,900
Right, right.

1447
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,900
I saw you up there that day.

1448
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,900
I mean, yeah, five years is a long time for everything to change.

1449
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,900
People coming and going, certain things changing.

1450
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:06,900
We lost a lot of people.

1451
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,900
Remember Captain Jack?

1452
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,900
Bless his soul.

1453
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,900
That's right.

1454
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,900
We've been doing this show for five years for Captain Jack.

1455
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,900
Yes.

1456
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,900
All right, well, Zaku, any other last thoughts for our listeners before we move on?

1457
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,900
That's pretty much it.

1458
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,900
All right.

1459
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,900
Have a good one and smoke one for us, buddy.

1460
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,900
I don't smoke.

1461
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,900
I know.

1462
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:27,900
I'm giving you a hard time.

1463
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:28,900
Of course you don't.

1464
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,900
How dare I insinuate that?

1465
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,900
All right.

1466
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,900
Have a good one, buddy.

1467
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,900
I love Zaku.

1468
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,900
Actually, I've met him.

1469
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,900
He's a good kid in real life.

1470
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,900
He really is.

1471
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:40,900
We give him a hard time on this show sometimes.

1472
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,900
That's because we do that to our listeners who've called in a bunch.

1473
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,900
Let's go to another call.

1474
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,900
Hi.

1475
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,900
You're on Orange Lawn.

1476
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,900
Oh, we're supposed to get to your segment, huh, Jamie?

1477
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:47,900
I'm sorry.

1478
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:48,900
I promise.

1479
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,900
I have to answer the one call I've been telling you to.

1480
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:50,900
Okay.

1481
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:51,900
We'll get a couple.

1482
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,900
Here we go.

1483
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:53,900
Hi.

1484
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,900
Orange Lawn's radio.

1485
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:55,900
Who's this?

1486
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:56,900
Hello?

1487
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,900
Hello?

1488
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,900
It's nobody.

1489
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,900
Uh-oh.

1490
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Someone having microphone troubles.

1491
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:04,900
Okay.

1492
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,900
Your five years are up.

1493
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
Where's the chrome hounds?

1494
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,900
Oh, ha, ha.

1495
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,900
Chrome hound, ha, ha.

1496
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,900
Yeah, whatever happened to that big chrome hounds match we were supposed to have?

1497
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,900
Who is this?

1498
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,900
Well, we found out that the game sucked, and then I stopped playing.

1499
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,900
Identify yourself, caller, for those that may not know.

1500
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,900
I'm Bobby.

1501
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:23,900
Hi, Bobby.

1502
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,900
And I'm not going to say where I'm from because it's about you.

1503
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,900
I know.

1504
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:28,900
I appreciate that, Bobby.

1505
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,900
All right.

1506
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,900
You can say where you're from.

1507
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,900
We don't care.

1508
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,900
It's okay.

1509
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:33,900
Back east.

1510
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,900
So, yeah, whatever happened to the chrome hounds match?

1511
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,900
Chrome hounds sucks or what?

1512
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,900
It was just a horrible game.

1513
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,900
We'd already sold it back.

1514
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,900
We couldn't get enough people.

1515
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,900
He was running from me.

1516
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,900
Running?

1517
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,900
Those things can't even run.

1518
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
They just slowly move away.

1519
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,900
You were slowly waddling away from me.

1520
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,900
Bobby, as I understand it, you're Loki's only friend on PlayStation 3.

1521
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,900
No, he was my only friend, and now I have, like, seven.

1522
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,900
Oh, okay.

1523
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:59,900
Oh, well, I see.

1524
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,900
You haven't added me, have you?

1525
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,900
You're cheating on Bobby.

1526
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,900
No, because I don't play my PlayStation 3.

1527
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,900
Have you guys ever actually played a game together on PlayStation 3?

1528
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:08,900
No.

1529
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:09,900
That's sad.

1530
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,900
Have you guys ever played a game together on Xbox?

1531
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,900
No, I don't think so.

1532
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,900
You're never on Xbox.

1533
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,900
No, we played Texas Hold'em one time, I think.

1534
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,900
Yeah.

1535
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,900
Yeah, I remember that.

1536
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:23,900
Well, gosh, Bobby, I know you've been podcasting a long time, too, and doing your thing.

1537
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:24,900
What do you think?

1538
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,900
Five years is a long time.

1539
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,900
A lot of stuff's happened in the game industry.

1540
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:34,900
What do you think has been a real big important news story in the world of gaming that we

1541
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,900
should take a moment to reflect on at this, our five-year mark?

1542
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,900
It's changed the gaming world.

1543
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:47,900
Yeah, I believe that the final rise of rhythm games in the U.S., something that I've been

1544
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,900
really wanting for a long time, because I was a big fan of Bimani Games back in college

1545
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:58,900
and all that stuff, and finally being able to buy them legitimately for my local game

1546
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:04,900
system, is really something that I really think is a big deal to me, at least.

1547
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:11,900
So, how tons of us had to import that shit for years, and now we can just get a lot of

1548
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:12,900
that stuff stateside.

1549
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:17,900
Yeah, and that was actually one of the things I wanted to call in to see if you guys had

1550
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:24,900
seen about Rock Band, via Kotaku posts a scan of a magazine that shows the drum peripheral

1551
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:25,900
for Rock Band.

1552
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,900
Yeah, I have that magazine.

1553
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,900
The drum peripheral, though, it's a concept drive.

1554
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:36,900
It's an artist rendition, which is from their memory of when they played the prototype,

1555
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,000
and I really hope that's not it.

1556
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,900
Because it looks like a blatant rip-off of Drummania.

1557
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,900
No, because it's not even shaped like real drumset.

1558
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,900
It's like bongos.

1559
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:55,700
Yeah, it's like four drums instead of five, and they're not in any kind of order or anything.

1560
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:01,700
It's basically beat the pad instead of, necessarily, actual drums, because you actually play drums,

1561
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,700
correct?

1562
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,700
Yes.

1563
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,700
So this is a subject near and dear to your heart.

1564
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,700
Right.

1565
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,940
I want a good drum peripheral for the home game, which I didn't think that Drummania

1566
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:12,500
for the consoles had.

1567
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,380
I like the arcade version of Drummania.

1568
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,760
That was actually a Yamaha drumset that I actually considered buying myself, getting

1569
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,700
the Yamaha DT Express 3.

1570
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,540
It will work with it, too.

1571
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,900
It gives you instructions in the manual how to set it up.

1572
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,900
Yeah, but I bought a Roland one, anyway.

1573
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:30,360
But I think Rockband, they were saying that they would actually work with all electronic

1574
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,220
drumsets that use MIDI and stuff, so I won't have to worry about using this controller,

1575
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,420
but I feel bad for anybody else who does.

1576
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,420
I still don't know.

1577
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,820
The jury's still out on Rockband for me.

1578
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,060
I want to see a little more about it.

1579
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:47,640
The concept sounds cool, but I'm kind of a little bit leery of spending all this money

1580
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,640
on it.

1581
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,100
To be honest, it looks a little too similar to Guitar Hero 3.

1582
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:58,400
I know that it's developed by the same company, but it looks a little too similar.

1583
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,540
There's going to be some trouble.

1584
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:06,620
Even Guitar Hero 3 doesn't look like Guitar Hero 2, pretty much, because Harmonix didn't

1585
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:11,660
give them the code, so Guitar Hero 3 is built from the ground up by Neversoft.

1586
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:16,100
So I think Rockband's actually building on the Guitar Hero code base a little bit.

1587
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,100
Very interesting.

1588
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,340
I want to ask you real quick, because I know you're a fan of Beat Manias, you've claimed

1589
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:23,980
as one of your favorite games of all time.

1590
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:27,040
You kind of have me thinking about the whole Japanese-U.S. thing.

1591
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:32,220
You really can't get a game like Beat Mania here in the U.S. like you can in Japan, though.

1592
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:36,500
So to some, there's still a big need to import.

1593
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:43,200
All the good songs are on 2DX that you have to import, so I'm still importing those, because

1594
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,120
I'm sorry, the Britney Spears one on the U.S. Beat Mania doesn't cover it, but I do like

1595
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,300
the U.S. controller for Beat Mania more than the Japanese home controller.

1596
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,300
They did fix that.

1597
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,780
They sure did.

1598
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:56,580
Real quick comment in chat that I think is interesting, and I apologize to chat room.

1599
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:57,580
We haven't been ignoring you.

1600
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,460
We've just been focusing so much on the collars.

1601
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:04,940
SSJ100matt in chat says, super hardcore Bomani fans refuse to give Rockband a chance and

1602
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:07,260
are already judging it.

1603
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,860
What do you think about those people that are judging the game?

1604
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:13,880
Do they do that just because, I don't know, they're ignorant, or do they do that because

1605
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,880
Guitar Hero was disappointed?

1606
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:22,460
I'm sad because I think that if Konami really took a risk and released Guitar Freak's Drummania

1607
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:26,140
over here, and then later on with Karaoke Revolution, we could already have something

1608
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:29,100
like this, and they could be dominating the market.

1609
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:34,020
But instead, they have focused on other places.

1610
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:39,780
Konami's problem was that they insisted on keeping all the J-Rock and the J-Pop and all

1611
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:43,980
that stuff, which is great for that segment and great for their current fans, but to get

1612
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:48,220
the rest of the audience, they needed to put in songs that people here recognized, and

1613
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,760
they never did that.

1614
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:55,460
Even when Hip Hop Mania was tested in arcades, it was still all the J-Pop and all that stuff.

1615
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:00,220
That's where Harmonix picked it up and said, hey, let's do this, and they put in songs

1616
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:03,660
people recognized, and it became a big hit.

1617
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:05,020
That's true.

1618
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:09,820
One thing we've said a lot on this show that Guitar Hero has a lot to thank for its success

1619
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,900
is the fact that they made the song list a lot smarter.

1620
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,980
They were able to take a little more risks on it, whereas Konami was always playing it

1621
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:20,660
safe and felt that the game would sell itself, which is the engine, if that makes sense.

1622
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:24,300
They didn't know how they would market a guitar game over here.

1623
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,420
That was their exact sales rep's opinion on it.

1624
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:33,980
They didn't know how they would be able to market it over here, which is dumb.

1625
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,060
People look at it and then play it.

1626
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:41,860
A lot of Guitar Hero marketing is because Best Buy has it set up, and people just walk

1627
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:43,020
up and try to play it.

1628
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,500
That's most of their marketing, and a lot of people have bought it because of that.

1629
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,140
Very similar to the Wii, I would say.

1630
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,780
You see somebody playing it and then you're like, wow, I want to try that.

1631
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,580
It's kind of different.

1632
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:58,300
Well, Bobby, we've got to get some more calls and move on, but anything else you want to

1633
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,940
share with our listeners?

1634
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:02,260
No, it's just congrats on the five years.

1635
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,060
I know how hard the first hundred was for me.

1636
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,740
I do want to just share this, and I promise it will only be about a minute long, is that

1637
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:16,460
I was scared to email the mailbag about two years ago when it was still the to-go edition

1638
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,460
and stuff.

1639
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:21,380
I remember it took me a couple of weeks to get the courage to even email Jamie asking

1640
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:27,500
about high-definition television lag, fearing her wrath and beat mania.

1641
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,380
I think I was nice, wasn't I?

1642
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:31,860
She's nice to most of our emailers.

1643
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,220
You were, but it was just kind of like, oh, these are the guys I've been listening to

1644
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,660
for so long, because I had heard of you guys and I had listened before the podcast came

1645
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,660
around and stuff.

1646
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:44,620
It was kind of like the whole celebrity, oh, I don't know if I want to bother them and

1647
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:47,100
stuff like that.

1648
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,540
You guys did inspire me to do what I do, and I know you've inspired a lot of other people.

1649
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,540
Thank you for that.

1650
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,820
That is truly the ultimate compliment.

1651
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,740
Compliments don't get much bigger than that, honestly.

1652
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:57,740
Thank you.

1653
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,740
I know.

1654
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,740
It's amazing.

1655
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:05,460
Thank you so much, Bobby, and we look forward to at least another 100 episodes from you

1656
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:09,580
and working with you to help make those a success as well as all of the things we partner

1657
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,580
up to do.

1658
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,820
Thanks so much, and thanks for doing this.

1659
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,820
Now talk about games.

1660
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:14,820
All right.

1661
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,820
We'll try.

1662
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:16,820
Thanks, Bobby.

1663
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:17,820
Bye.

1664
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:18,820
Bye.

1665
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:19,820
All right.

1666
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,620
One more call, then we'll get to Jamie's bit, and then we'll take more calls, because we

1667
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:22,820
still got some energy left in us.

1668
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:24,060
We're going to do a long show tonight.

1669
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,060
That's all right.

1670
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,060
Hi.

1671
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,060
Have you finally got to your call?

1672
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,060
Yo.

1673
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,060
What's up, everyone?

1674
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,060
Hey.

1675
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,060
Hi.

1676
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:34,060
What's good, people?

1677
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,060
It's Amy.

1678
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,060
You know our call.

1679
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,060
You know it's official.

1680
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,060
The party cannot begin.

1681
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:39,060
I'm here.

1682
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:40,060
Yay.

1683
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,060
Toga.

1684
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,060
Toga.

1685
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:43,060
Damn right.

1686
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,060
Toga party.

1687
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,060
Rama, you're a little bit quiet, but what's on your mind?

1688
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:46,060
Oh, not much.

1689
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,060
I'm sorry about the quietness.

1690
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,060
My headset's being a total douchebag tonight, okay?

1691
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:49,060
Fuck Logitech.

1692
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,060
Anywho, let's get off the whole political gaming shit.

1693
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:51,060
Let's get on with the show.

1694
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,060
Let's go.

1695
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,060
Let's go.

1696
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:54,060
Let's go.

1697
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,060
Let's go.

1698
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:56,060
Let's go.

1699
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,060
Let's go.

1700
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,060
Let's get off the gaming shit.

1701
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:01,060
Let's get onto the fun stuff straight up.

1702
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:02,620
Let's get to the fun stuff here.

1703
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:06,780
You know, episode 69 is definitely best episode ever.

1704
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:11,540
I definitely vote on that, and you guys got to put it up on RSS people.

1705
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:12,540
Keep the download.

1706
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,540
They've got to hear.

1707
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:14,540
I'm staying in.

1708
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:15,540
They've got to.

1709
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:16,660
Well, we'll see what we can do.

1710
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:20,440
I don't know about they have to hear that, but whatever, we'll see.

1711
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,700
I don't think it'll go in the...

1712
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,120
You have no say in this, man.

1713
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,820
The fans demand it.

1714
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:28,460
I promise you I will send I'm Stayin' In to Scott

1715
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,920
and let him carry out that legacy on the soundboard

1716
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,580
to the evil glares that are coming from Loki.

1717
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:37,880
And not just that, but we'll do something special

1718
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,920
for our listeners.

1719
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,880
I don't know about the RSS,

1720
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,520
but for those on the LiveJournal, the MySpace,

1721
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,080
we'll do something for you.

1722
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,600
There you go, there you go.

1723
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,200
That's what I'm talking about.

1724
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,920
Now, you know, I started my own podcast,

1725
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,880
and I have to say, you guys were the reason

1726
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,600
why I started doing this again,

1727
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,000
because before all of this, I used to run

1728
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,040
my little two-hour music special

1729
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,000
on my frickin' cable connect,

1730
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,280
and, you know, like maybe every two weeks or whatever,

1731
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,520
and I just stopped doing it,

1732
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,320
and after you guys started doing it again,

1733
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,880
I'm like, you know, I gotta get in, you know?

1734
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,920
I started listening to other podcasts about anime.

1735
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,260
I couldn't get into it,

1736
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,440
so I just had a bad-mouth one of my favorite cons,

1737
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,840
so I'm like, you know what, put up or shut up.

1738
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,960
That's one of the reasons why I'm doing my show.

1739
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,760
Has anybody called in tonight who doesn't have

1740
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,600
their own podcast?

1741
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,280
That's what I'm wondering at this point.

1742
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,120
Probably.

1743
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:30,520
I'm just messing with you, Rama, it's all good.

1744
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,280
God, I don't even know what to ask you.

1745
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:39,200
It's so difficult, because I know you outside

1746
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,320
of this show now, which is kind of something

1747
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,560
interesting in itself.

1748
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,440
Like, you've kind of met all of us in person

1749
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,760
and all that stuff, so, oh God,

1750
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,200
what the hell do I ask you, Rama?

1751
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,760
Look, if you gotta get a little personal,

1752
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,640
I don't care, because I already had a drink

1753
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:54,780
before I got here.

1754
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,600
Well, I don't know, I don't want to get that personal.

1755
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,740
I don't, I'm only your friend, Rama, that's all.

1756
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,880
I don't know, you guys got anything for Rama?

1757
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,280
Jamie, you've been here to talk to Rama all night?

1758
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,440
Hi.

1759
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,500
Hey.

1760
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,720
Dude, I want to come to New York.

1761
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,240
Dude, I want to come back after Cali one more time.

1762
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,840
I'll try, maybe by the end of the year,

1763
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,720
I'll bring a crew with me, maybe.

1764
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,440
Cool, go have a barbecue.

1765
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,380
Here we go, I got a question.

1766
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:22,240
Okay, you guys, your little banter there

1767
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,280
inspired a question here.

1768
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,360
Rama, what are the differences, you think,

1769
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,200
because you've been to both coasts now,

1770
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,320
what do you think are the differences

1771
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,520
between the East Coast scene and the West Coast scene,

1772
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,200
the gaming and anime scene?

1773
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,440
Because I know we have a lot of listeners of the show

1774
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,160
who are deeply, who have anime as a passion as well,

1775
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:42,320
and if you don't, just tune out for a couple seconds.

1776
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,440
Rama, what would you say is the difference

1777
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,520
between the gaming and anime scene

1778
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,080
in the East Coast and West Coast?

1779
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:50,080
Well, I can't say too much, but it used to be

1780
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,280
the West Coast was all about the con, the cosplay,

1781
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,160
the time you put into making that costume.

1782
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,920
The East Coast was like, we don't give a flying fuck

1783
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,080
if you did put 100 hours into that,

1784
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,560
that pretty separate costume.

1785
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,360
How much alcohol can you take Saturday night?

1786
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,820
That's what it was always about.

1787
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,720
West Coast, the cosplay, the East Coast was about the party.

1788
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:13,880
I don't know, faname's always kind of been about

1789
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,480
who can hold their liquor.

1790
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,380
It's blending now, I mean, I see on the West Coast,

1791
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,760
people over there, if West Coast was more fun,

1792
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,920
more friendly, you know, that's what I saw.

1793
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,320
When I had fun, I really had a great time.

1794
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,760
I mean, a lot of props to people.

1795
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,640
I don't see a lot of that over on the East Coast,

1796
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,520
because half the time,

1797
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,200
it's all about the fucking drama shit.

1798
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,040
I mean, on the West Coast, I know there's drama,

1799
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,480
but they keep it on the down low.

1800
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,680
Whereas on the East Coast, all it takes

1801
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,280
is somebody to walk past, let the drama roll begin,

1802
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,380
you know, and it's just too much.

1803
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:46,240
It depends on the clicks.

1804
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,440
That too, and it's like, and whereas me,

1805
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,080
I'm with multiple clicks, and it's like,

1806
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,080
I gotta be careful who I chill with,

1807
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,440
and I bet if I had those same clicks on the West Coast,

1808
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,800
the drama shit wouldn't even bother.

1809
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,240
It was like, fine, whatever.

1810
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,040
We're all gonna have a good time.

1811
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:01,840
All right.

1812
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,000
Oh, go ahead.

1813
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,200
As for the gaming, I would say, you know,

1814
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,320
one thing about the West Coast,

1815
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,900
the gamers know how to use deodorant.

1816
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,180
That's what I can say, definitely.

1817
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:16,940
I didn't really catch too much fanboy funk

1818
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:18,140
this year, though.

1819
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,860
Exactly, I mean, you go to like Otacon,

1820
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,780
which is like the big convention, you walk in,

1821
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,460
you're gonna get smacked in the face

1822
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,680
with a wave of funk, seriously.

1823
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,100
And not the good George Clinton kind, right?

1824
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,180
Exactly.

1825
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,020
Mm-hmm.

1826
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,100
I think it's kind of funky in here,

1827
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,900
because we've been, you know, smelling Rob.

1828
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,740
Oh, shut up.

1829
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,580
I took a shower today just for you.

1830
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,380
Maybe someone took their sneakers off.

1831
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,540
Sorry, I just had to run out

1832
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,740
and check on the air situation,

1833
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:46,740
because we're burning up in here, so anyway.

1834
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,940
Rama, thanks so much for the call,

1835
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,460
and for being a friend.

1836
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:52,860
Thank you for being a friend.

1837
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,260
Now, before I go, you know,

1838
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,500
I have to do the same toast I did last year,

1839
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,180
even though somebody stole it, I'm gonna do it.

1840
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,020
Go for it.

1841
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,020
In my hands is a can of Guinness.

1842
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,380
I'm gonna crack it open right now.

1843
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,460
I have the last sip of champagne left in my glass.

1844
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,600
I have champagne in my belly.

1845
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,500
Then I'll toast our soccer's belly.

1846
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,340
No.

1847
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,060
I'm Guinness at home, so I'll just do it when I get home.

1848
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,360
Okay, take it away, Rama.

1849
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,200
Here we go.

1850
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,820
Here's to you, here's to me,

1851
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,700
the best a friend will ever be.

1852
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:25,940
If we ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you,

1853
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:26,820
and here's to me.

1854
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:28,300
I'm drinking this bitch down.

1855
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,140
Very well said.

1856
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:32,980
Oop, I actually just tried to use

1857
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,020
the champagne glass as a microphone.

1858
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:35,860
Oh, no.

1859
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,700
Oh, no.

1860
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,520
Oh, no.

1861
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,360
Oh, no.

1862
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:40,580
All right.

1863
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,100
Rama, thanks so much for the call,

1864
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:42,940
and take care, buddy.

1865
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:43,780
No problem, I'll talk to you guys.

1866
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:45,220
I'll see you guys sometime again.

1867
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,060
It's gonna happen.

1868
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,420
All right, later, buddy.

1869
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,260
Peace.

1870
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,520
Wow, okay, we got lots and lots of calls still coming in.

1871
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,100
We're willing to go a little long tonight for this,

1872
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,940
but we've gotta get to the mailbag,

1873
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,780
because Darcy.

1874
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,620
No, we don't.

1875
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,340
Do you not wanna do mailbag tonight?

1876
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:02,220
I could do mailbag, but no.

1877
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,220
Let's do a couple emails.

1878
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,060
Okay.

1879
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:04,880
All right, because some folks,

1880
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,620
not everybody can get in on the phone.

1881
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,600
And I really apologize to those of you

1882
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,180
like calling on the phone like crazy.

1883
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,980
Some folks have been calling in seriously

1884
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,080
since we started taking calls,

1885
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,620
and still haven't gotten through.

1886
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:18,460
We're gonna take more calls very soon, I promise.

1887
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,900
Just, we wanna get to the email bags,

1888
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:20,740
and then more calls,

1889
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:23,720
and we'll hopefully get everybody that's trying to call in,

1890
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,540
even if we have to go to the two-minute lightning round.

1891
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:26,600
All right, here we go.

1892
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,740
Mailbag time.

1893
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:38,740
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com, we always welcome your emails, and Dark Shocker is gonna read them right now.

1894
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:39,580
I am?

1895
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,420
Okay.

1896
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,700
It's you better.

1897
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,500
First email is,

1898
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,400
Dear O.L.R., I have one simple question.

1899
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,900
What the hell happened to White Knight for the PS3?

1900
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,740
Keep up the great work, your Serbian listener.

1901
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:55,740
Aljosha, PS level five needs to make another Dark Cloud game.

1902
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,900
I'm the foggiest idea.

1903
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,940
I haven't been following that game.

1904
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,100
Loki, you know anything about this?

1905
01:19:59,100 --> 01:19:59,980
This is more up your alley

1906
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:02,180
with the whole title's just not come out yet.

1907
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,060
Is it delayed?

1908
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,940
Cancel's just kinda sleeping?

1909
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,140
Probably sleeping.

1910
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:06,960
You know what?

1911
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,800
You know where White Knight is?

1912
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,540
It's with Africa.

1913
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:10,420
That's where White Knight went.

1914
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:12,600
The White Knight went to Africa.

1915
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,620
That's where it is.

1916
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,820
Eh, okay.

1917
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:15,660
We don't know, buddy.

1918
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,700
Sorry, they haven't said anything.

1919
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:17,540
That's the best we got.

1920
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,500
Unless Chat Room knows something, we don't.

1921
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:22,220
What does the Chat Room know that we don't?

1922
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:23,580
They're just saying Africa.

1923
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:25,300
Yeah.

1924
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,120
Love it.

1925
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,340
Yeah.

1926
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,440
This is from Sakura Legends.

1927
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:32,740
Dear OLR, birthday celebration is great.

1928
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:33,820
What are you guys gonna do?

1929
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,260
DDR celebration, getting drunk,

1930
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,180
then having a DDR celebration?

1931
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,020
But for all I know,

1932
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,220
Pokemon Battle Revolution comes out tomorrow,

1933
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:44,060
and that means I can play my Pokemans on the big screen.

1934
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:45,540
Rob, I'll stop making hate mail.

1935
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,980
I've decided to make more emails

1936
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:49,500
begging Loki to play more Drunken Mario Kart GP.

1937
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:53,140
The annoying 12-year-old who wants more Drunken Mario Kart

1938
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,220
needs another arcade because the last one left

1939
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,860
doesn't have DDR, but has Initial D.

1940
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,140
But we're suing the place,

1941
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:00,640
and so it isn't smart to go there.

1942
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:03,580
Still youngest listener, DDR maniac, and that's all.

1943
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,620
Wow, that's a hell of a signature.

1944
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,620
Thank you for backing off for once.

1945
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:12,420
And YouTube, we need more stuff on YouTube.

1946
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:14,380
My camera does a lot of better digital stuff now,

1947
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:16,700
so we need to do some craziness on YouTube.

1948
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,840
Loki, drink, and then we'll film you.

1949
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,220
It's funny.

1950
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,060
Okay.

1951
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,140
I'm sifting through the emails

1952
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:25,380
because I wanna get some of them read.

1953
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:29,540
One of them is Mastakilla.

1954
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:33,140
Hi, I hear that Rob bought Puzzle Quest on DS.

1955
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:35,300
I recently purchased the game on PSP.

1956
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,900
The game is great, but the game freezes every second.

1957
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,340
I'm not sure what it is.

1958
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:42,340
I looked in all the forums, and I'm not the only one.

1959
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:45,460
Does the glitches and freezes occur

1960
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:48,420
only on the DS version you have?

1961
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,740
Did you hear anything about a recall or patch coming soon?

1962
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:51,660
PS, love the show.

1963
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:52,740
Smile face.

1964
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:53,580
Thank you.

1965
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,840
I have not had a problem with freezing on the DS.

1966
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:56,900
Granted, I've only played for a couple of hours.

1967
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:57,740
For original Puzzle Quest?

1968
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,580
Puzzle Quest.

1969
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,100
Yeah, I did hear of an issue with that.

1970
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,580
For DS or PSP, because he says he has the PSP one.

1971
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,660
There was something with the PSP one.

1972
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,620
Something was broken on it, I don't remember.

1973
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:08,920
I read this a long time ago.

1974
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,860
Email the manufacturer and see what kind of response you get

1975
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,580
because lurking on the forums doesn't always help

1976
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:16,380
because you get people that make shit up on forums.

1977
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,560
Very common thing in the gaming scene in the internet.

1978
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,300
You get too many people that make shit up.

1979
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,780
So go email the manufacturer directly

1980
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:26,020
and see if they have an official statement.

1981
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,780
That sounds like a good idea.

1982
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,060
Next email, shall I?

1983
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:30,660
Sure.

1984
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:31,700
Hey, OLR crew.

1985
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,340
First and foremost, congratulations

1986
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:34,700
on your fifth anniversary.

1987
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,100
I hope you continue to output the same level of awesomeness

1988
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,180
or higher in the future.

1989
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,980
I started listening to OLR last year

1990
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,580
after looking for Orange Lounge songs

1991
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:45,380
to put on my MySpace profile, only to assemble

1992
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,140
on the OLR MySpace page.

1993
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:51,340
My first episode, funnily enough,

1994
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,340
was the fourth anniversary episode,

1995
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,380
which kept me busy during freshman orientation

1996
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,380
at my college campus when I have nothing to do

1997
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:58,940
and on a road trip to Reno.

1998
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,660
On another note, something about the OLR afterbirth cage match

1999
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,100
has been bugging me lately.

2000
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:05,220
Songs that win supposedly get put in rotation

2001
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,060
on the stream, which I've listened to while playing

2002
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,540
Albatross 18.

2003
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:12,820
Yet the only cage match winner I've heard on the stream

2004
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:15,300
is Loki's Zodiac Don't Play Nice Mashup.

2005
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,260
Are these songs actually being put in play

2006
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,060
or am I just listening at the wrong times?

2007
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,420
Love, GS68.

2008
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:24,660
They are, but the problem is we have a 16-hour playlist

2009
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,380
on the regular station, and it's only

2010
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,180
going to come up once in that time.

2011
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:29,980
So I think you're just, I mean, it sounds

2012
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,820
like you've heard it once.

2013
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,340
But yeah, the problem is, you know,

2014
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:37,060
it's one song in a huge rotation of music.

2015
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:39,580
So unfortunately, it doesn't always come up.

2016
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,260
And sometimes it does go into the rotation late in the week

2017
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:45,340
because I'm lazy.

2018
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:48,100
But honestly, though, I have to admit,

2019
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,980
cage match song going into rotation

2020
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:53,100
is the last priority behind getting the podcast out

2021
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,060
on time and all that, making sure all games gets

2022
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,180
the syndicated run and all that stuff.

2023
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,700
Last email.

2024
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,780
Dear Orange Jones Radio, collectively known as Rob, Matt,

2025
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:02,780
and Jamie, congratulations on five years

2026
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:04,540
of being a festering rash on the internet.

2027
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,340
JK, heart, heart, heart, heart.

2028
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,300
Seriously, though, you guys are freaking awesome.

2029
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,420
I first learned about LLR through DDR Freak Forums

2030
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:12,300
because someone had a link in their signature

2031
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:13,740
and decided to check it out.

2032
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,400
Unfortunately, I was an internet noob

2033
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,780
and had no idea what was going on,

2034
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:18,440
so I just thought it was a music station.

2035
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,820
That was three or four years ago.

2036
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:20,900
Smell face.

2037
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,580
Fall of 2005 was when I rediscovered

2038
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,220
LLR and learned about your now deceased frowny face,

2039
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,380
OLR To Go edition.

2040
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,740
Isn't this for what we're doing for the whole show now?

2041
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,660
Well, kind of.

2042
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,500
But you know, some people liked it better

2043
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,740
in its compact format.

2044
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,860
But you know, we have to make decisions

2045
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:38,180
based on what we think is best, and you can't please everybody.

2046
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,980
So sorry you didn't agree.

2047
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:44,020
It was an hour slash hour and a half of news,

2048
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,900
Rob being funny, Jamie being angry,

2049
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,060
and Matt hating on Max.

2050
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:47,580
Woo hoo.

2051
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,940
That was my freshman year.

2052
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:53,940
Now I'm a junior, well, going to B1P, the tongue face.

2053
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:55,780
And I've listened to every episode of LLR

2054
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,420
since you guys started the new format.

2055
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,580
You three are my main source of gaming information

2056
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:01,260
with Kotaku filling in the blanks

2057
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,060
and also a big source of entertainment.

2058
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,940
I have to say that it's mildly awkward when one of you

2059
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:07,660
are Rice Princess or X-A-Fur or Casper the Gay,

2060
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:10,460
with an O face, or anyone else says some hilarious

2061
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:12,220
and I burst into laughter in the train

2062
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,500
and other public place, which leads to weird stares

2063
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,420
and quiet mutterings.

2064
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,900
That kid is crazy.

2065
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,020
Of course, that's half the fun.

2066
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,220
I want to get mushy, but that's too weird.

2067
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,860
So I'll just leave it at that, and then

2068
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:24,980
congratulate you guys on five years

2069
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:27,300
of being some of the coolest people on the internet

2070
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,180
and wish you luck in the next five years.

2071
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,140
I'll make a shirt that says, I grew up with Orange Lounge.

2072
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,660
Since yearly years, with hearts and love, heart, heart, heart,

2073
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:38,100
heart, PS.

2074
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,300
That's a cute email.

2075
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,340
I bought Pac-Man CE, and I'm not sure why, cry cry.

2076
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:46,820
PPS, shoot the whoop, charging my lasers.

2077
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:47,320
What?

2078
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,580
I don't know, but it's funny.

2079
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,460
They just wanted you to say that on air,

2080
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:52,300
so they could cut that out and have that as a sound play.

2081
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:52,820
That's great.

2082
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,580
Shoot the whoop.

2083
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:56,740
I'd just go around saying, charging my lasers.

2084
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,420
Shoot the whoop.

2085
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:58,460
That was awesome.

2086
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:59,860
You need to send emails like that again,

2087
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,120
so I can send more cool stuff.

2088
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,460
You play Pac-Man CE for the Ray-Var music.

2089
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,460
That's why.

2090
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,460
That's why you play it.

2091
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:06,960
Yeah.

2092
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:07,460
All right.

2093
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:07,660
You know what?

2094
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,740
We got a last minute one.

2095
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,580
Should I read it?

2096
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:10,620
Sure, why not?

2097
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:12,460
It's someone who couldn't get a call in.

2098
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,420
Well, we're still going to take more calls, but OK.

2099
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,500
Go ahead and read it.

2100
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,020
Well, this is from GS191.

2101
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,740
OK.

2102
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,940
Shit, I'd rather call, but my microphone ain't working.

2103
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,020
Besides, I feel more comfortable this way.

2104
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,220
Hey, PPLs of OLR.

2105
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,300
Congratulation to five years of OLR.

2106
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,620
I must admit that I feel kind of old being around

2107
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,780
for most of those five years, going back

2108
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,620
to the drunk episodes and the randomness that

2109
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,260
is the three hour show.

2110
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,420
I have so much praise for you guys, Skydark, Sakura,

2111
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:38,500
and Loki, and everyone else who has made this show

2112
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,380
for us today.

2113
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,020
So yeah, the reason I'm writing just recently

2114
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,260
are probably already implemented the game review site

2115
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:44,900
that nobody gives two shits about.

2116
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,620
No, not one up.

2117
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:48,340
GameSpot is going to change its rating systems this week.

2118
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:50,580
They state that they are going to a 0.5 base system,

2119
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,780
no more 8.8 like scores.

2120
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,380
And I lost my place.

2121
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:56,700
And going to remove the sub score system for graphics,

2122
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:57,980
game play, sound, et cetera.

2123
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:00,380
They are going to add metal slash rewards

2124
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,980
slash achievement slash e-penis points for things

2125
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:04,980
like excellent graphics and sound

2126
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:07,020
to blatant over-whoring of advertisements

2127
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:08,540
that overall suck.

2128
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,980
As for many listeners, including myself, we could give a shit.

2129
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:14,060
But it got me thinking, why are people so fixated

2130
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,140
with the 7 out of 10 score for an average game?

2131
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:19,180
Why, whatever happened to a five being average?

2132
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:20,300
Is it too low for people?

2133
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:22,100
Is it too close to a three or a one?

2134
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,760
Do fanboys have a splintered, by the way,

2135
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,580
fanboys, to make it plural, you do not add an apostrophe.

2136
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:28,860
Have a splintered baseball bat stuck up their ass?

2137
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:29,660
Who the fuck knows?

2138
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:32,020
I would like to ask if any of the current rating systems

2139
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:34,140
work, or do they need to all be revamped and howl.

2140
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,860
Thanks for your time, GS191.

2141
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,260
Wow, heavy question.

2142
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,340
It's because now people.

2143
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:41,700
I read that like the biggest run-on sentence ever.

2144
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,180
Seriously.

2145
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,780
If you were to look at like mathematically,

2146
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:47,420
yes, five would be average.

2147
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:50,460
Although people are looking at it like grade scores,

2148
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:54,980
which 50% would be failure, and 70% would be average.

2149
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:59,140
So unfortunately, everybody's sucking that school mentality.

2150
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,740
And that's why the rating systems all fucked up.

2151
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:05,060
Because it's actually a five point system instead of 10,

2152
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,340
because those bottom five are failures.

2153
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:13,780
You know, I don't really study a lot of game reviews

2154
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:15,380
on the internet, because I find I just

2155
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:16,580
often don't agree with them.

2156
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:19,020
I have yet to really find a reviewer that

2157
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,780
thinks the exact same way I do.

2158
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:24,660
Because everybody's kind of into different genres

2159
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,260
and different games.

2160
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:30,920
They could give a football game a 10, and I might run it.

2161
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:32,580
But I'm not going to run out and buy it,

2162
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,800
because I'm not really into sports games.

2163
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:35,900
That's just not my genre.

2164
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,860
That's not to say it's a bad game.

2165
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,580
But at the same time, I personally

2166
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,340
wouldn't attempt to review a Madden game,

2167
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:42,980
because I have no idea what the hell I'm looking for.

2168
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:45,380
I know what I like and what I don't like in a game, period.

2169
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:45,940
But I don't know.

2170
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:47,340
And also, you'll see a lot of times

2171
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:50,580
that reviews are skewed based on what their preferences are

2172
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,780
in gaming and stuff.

2173
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:54,740
Or like, for example, I know like IGN,

2174
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:57,420
you'll see a lot of these reviews that come in weeks

2175
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,700
after the games come out.

2176
01:28:58,700 --> 01:28:59,620
And you can pretty much guarantee

2177
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:00,860
that they're always going to be negative,

2178
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:04,020
because they're holding off on playing them until later on.

2179
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,580
And it could be stuff that's not half bad,

2180
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:08,820
but they have a vendetta against certain things

2181
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:12,180
like, for example, Fantastic Four or something.

2182
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,140
They'll say, well, I don't like Fantastic Four.

2183
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:18,920
So it gets a lower review, or something like that.

2184
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,100
But this isn't what I remember from the comics.

2185
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,380
We'll review it as a game, not as what

2186
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:24,980
you remember from the comics.

2187
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:27,220
Some folks in chat room are talking about X-Play.

2188
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:30,300
And JV Monn says, I hate X-Play's Para Para Paradise

2189
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:30,980
review.

2190
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:33,500
And it just goes to show you, some people

2191
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,120
don't get it, but there's a lot of games out there to play.

2192
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,820
And sometimes people don't get the things

2193
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:39,020
that other people are into.

2194
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:39,740
Here's the thing.

2195
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:42,740
They weren't actually reviewing Para Para Paradise.

2196
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:44,300
They were doing a funny bit.

2197
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,620
That's all they were doing.

2198
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:51,340
I mean, really, it hasn't come over here.

2199
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:53,900
It's not a game that was released in the United States.

2200
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,540
So why were they reviewing it?

2201
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:56,780
Oh, to be funny.

2202
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:58,940
That's why they were doing it.

2203
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,780
Because who doesn't like to laugh at someone playing Para

2204
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,980
Para Paradise, because it's such a girly game,

2205
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:07,020
and people like making fun of that.

2206
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:07,940
All right.

2207
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:10,100
Well, anything else, I guess?

2208
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,460
No, that was last email?

2209
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,340
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2210
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,460
We're running about an hour and a half into this,

2211
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,340
but we're going to take some more calls

2212
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:18,500
and keep on going.

2213
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,340
So here we go.

2214
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,140
Back to the phones.

2215
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:25,700
1-877-GAME-OLR, or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

2216
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28,260
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2217
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:29,460
Hey, guys, can you hear me?

2218
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:30,060
Yes, we can.

2219
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,020
Who is this?

2220
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:32,340
Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

2221
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:33,460
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.

2222
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:34,740
What's on your mind?

2223
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,140
Oh, not much.

2224
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,380
I just really wanted to call and say,

2225
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,740
happy to hear you guys got a 500 episode.

2226
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:42,660
Congratulations.

2227
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:47,340
It's actually five years, not 500, but that's all right.

2228
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:50,220
I'm still blitzed from today.

2229
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,420
Did we do a little drinking today?

2230
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:55,180
No, I was in the middle of the whole parade thing.

2231
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:56,700
It was nuts.

2232
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,700
It's strange that you're not the first person

2233
01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:03,420
to make that 500 mistake, which is kind of strange.

2234
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,860
OK, I don't feel so bad now.

2235
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:06,900
No, it's cool.

2236
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,340
It's all good.

2237
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,060
Let's talk about games.

2238
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:13,620
What kind of games have you been playing this week?

2239
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:15,980
Mostly DS stuff.

2240
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:18,780
What, are you a big fan of handhelds?

2241
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:20,500
Yeah, they're easy for me to get into

2242
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,300
and easy for me to take on the go,

2243
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:25,140
since I'm constantly in one place to another place

2244
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,780
to another place.

2245
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:29,300
Here's something big that's happened in the past five years

2246
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:32,020
is, remember when the DS was first announced

2247
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,620
and a lot of people were like, that's kind of weird

2248
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,540
that you're going to be using the touch screen.

2249
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:39,980
And now the system is like monstrously successful,

2250
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:41,460
the Nintendo DS.

2251
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:46,060
Why do you think Nintendo has had such success with the DS?

2252
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:48,660
Because they were forced to actually make games instead

2253
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:50,900
of just rehashing some stuff, one.

2254
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,900
And two, they actually took advantage

2255
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,020
of the originality of just using touch screen,

2256
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:00,260
rather than just saying, OK, here's a portable system.

2257
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:02,980
Just bring some games from the other systems

2258
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:06,820
and just water it down for the portables.

2259
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,860
Anybody else in the studio care to chime in?

2260
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:11,340
Because I think most of us here in studio prefer the DS

2261
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:12,060
to the PSP.

2262
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,180
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2263
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:16,340
What do you think has made the DS a winner?

2264
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,980
Because it's dedicated to games and trying

2265
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:20,980
to do 50 million other things.

2266
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,900
I actually really agree with that comment.

2267
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,820
I think that's why the DS has been successful,

2268
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:27,460
is that really the only thing you can do on it is games.

2269
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:30,340
I mean, granted, now they have the Opera browser and all

2270
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:30,900
that stuff.

2271
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,140
But let's face it, all that crap was an afterthought.

2272
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:34,980
It was really a game system first.

2273
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:37,220
And not to knock the PSP, because I

2274
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,580
know a lot of folks listen to this show on the PSP.

2275
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:42,420
And that's actually why the PSP is pretty awesome.

2276
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,420
Because it's like, it's the red mage of portable gaming

2277
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,940
is what the PSP is.

2278
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,940
It's a little bit of everything, but it's not

2279
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,540
really strong at anything.

2280
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,340
It's a little bit iPod.

2281
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:55,340
It's a little bit web browser.

2282
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,980
It's a little bit gaming.

2283
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:59,060
It's a little bit this and that.

2284
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:02,380
But it doesn't really 100% excel at any of it.

2285
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:04,060
But that doesn't necessarily make it bad.

2286
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,540
It's a red mage.

2287
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:08,740
That's quite possibly the best comparison I could make.

2288
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:11,820
Well, then you also get the PSP has a lot shorter battery life.

2289
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,940
So it does a little bit of a battery life.

2290
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:14,540
That's true.

2291
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:15,540
But don't get me wrong.

2292
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,340
I love my PSP.

2293
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,240
Try playing a nomad.

2294
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,820
And movies look so good.

2295
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:23,540
Movies look so sharp on the PSP, and so do websites.

2296
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:25,620
That's why I love that little screen on the PSP.

2297
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:29,140
I wish the DS had something that sharp.

2298
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,260
That I agree with.

2299
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,500
That I agree with.

2300
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:35,700
And I did play one other game that wasn't a handheld.

2301
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,020
What's that?

2302
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:39,420
Virtua Fighter V on the PS3.

2303
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:42,460
Oh, now how was that?

2304
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,740
I think I'm the only fan of the Virtua Fighter series,

2305
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:48,700
because I was in love with it.

2306
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,260
So you totally love the game?

2307
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,020
Oh, I love the series.

2308
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,020
Ah.

2309
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:55,220
Well, you know, I don't know.

2310
01:33:55,220 --> 01:33:57,180
DarkSakura, weren't you a bit of a Virtua Fighter fan,

2311
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:58,260
at least in the beginning?

2312
01:33:58,260 --> 01:33:58,780
Never.

2313
01:33:58,780 --> 01:33:59,820
I hate Virtua Fighter.

2314
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:00,900
I thought you did like it.

2315
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:03,220
No, Dan loves Virtua Fighter.

2316
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,980
I personally thought the game was shit.

2317
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,460
I just made you assume that, because you're

2318
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:07,180
a Sega fangirl.

2319
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,500
The only time I played any Virtua Fighter for any amount

2320
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,080
of time was playing Virtua Fighter II

2321
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:14,780
to try to knock off Kage's mask.

2322
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:17,180
And people know what I'm talking about.

2323
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,700
Yes.

2324
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:20,900
And I enjoyed the fifth one.

2325
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:25,660
And I actually also got to play on a high definition projector.

2326
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,100
Ooh.

2327
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:29,180
Oh, yeah.

2328
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:32,300
I didn't, I couldn't even play for like five minutes

2329
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,460
just watching it.

2330
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,980
It was like, ha ha.

2331
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:36,740
So Rob D says, I was more obsessed

2332
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:41,060
with knocking off Blue Mary's shirt in Real Bout 2.

2333
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:43,340
It's always the nudity with you people.

2334
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:44,500
I guess I'll say this.

2335
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:46,340
Have you played Xbox 360?

2336
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,100
Never?

2337
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:48,260
A few times, actually, yes.

2338
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:50,020
So what do you think graphics wise?

2339
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,140
Do you think a game like Virtua Fighter

2340
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,940
will look as good on the 360?

2341
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:56,420
I think it probably would work.

2342
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:58,300
I think it would probably look too good.

2343
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,740
My only concern about the series is

2344
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:03,980
that as long as it moves just the same, just as smooth.

2345
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,420
Because that's a game where it's a true Twitch

2346
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:09,580
fest, one frame and you're dead.

2347
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:10,180
Good point.

2348
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:13,220
And the reason why I ask that, not that I'm dumb or anything,

2349
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,820
because sometimes people say, well,

2350
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:18,540
the PS3 has the true HD built in and all this.

2351
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:21,220
I'm just kind of curious.

2352
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:22,620
They kind of insinuate that it has

2353
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:24,180
a graphical edge on Xbox 360.

2354
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:27,740
So I'm just kind of curious if anyone ever notices it ever.

2355
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:28,540
I think it would.

2356
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:31,660
But I think, honestly, the best way for me, to me,

2357
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:33,900
we actually get both of them side by side in a way

2358
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:36,500
and see how they look.

2359
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,900
Well, DDR dollar bill, we got to let you

2360
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,980
go to take some more calls.

2361
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,500
Any last minute thoughts?

2362
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,780
Yes, I don't have a podcast.

2363
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:44,420
There you go.

2364
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,000
All right, well then nothing to plug.

2365
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,140
So well, that's cool.

2366
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:49,300
Maybe you'll start one someday.

2367
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:49,820
I doubt it.

2368
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:50,700
I'm too busy.

2369
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:51,820
All right, well fair enough.

2370
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:53,360
Well, thank you for choosing ours to listen to.

2371
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:54,420
We appreciate it.

2372
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:54,980
Thanks, guys.

2373
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:57,260
Later.

2374
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,420
All right, Jamie, you get this call.

2375
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,180
This one is your turn.

2376
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,500
Hold on, I haven't picked up yet.

2377
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,000
Oh, OK.

2378
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:08,060
Sorry, Skype's being annoying.

2379
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,020
Hi.

2380
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:10,980
Hi.

2381
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,540
Who's this?

2382
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,700
It's Roz.

2383
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:15,540
Hi.

2384
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:16,940
It's Roz.

2385
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:19,620
Oh my god, hi.

2386
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,260
Hi.

2387
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:24,580
What's on your mind, Roz?

2388
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:27,100
I mostly wanted to talk to Jamie.

2389
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:29,020
OMG, a girl called in.

2390
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:31,260
OMG, a girl, a real life girl.

2391
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:36,300
What do you want to say, Jamie?

2392
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,920
I want to say I'm so sorry for disappearing.

2393
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,460
That's OK, I forgive you, I think.

2394
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:43,340
I do it all the time.

2395
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:47,340
You have to make up for it with bleached zombie butts.

2396
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:49,460
I'm sorry, what are you turning our fifth anniversary

2397
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:50,660
show into, you two?

2398
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:51,620
It's an in-joke.

2399
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:52,660
I see that.

2400
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:55,220
It's on the other site that I hang out on,

2401
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,420
Gorilla's Unofficial.

2402
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,620
I get it.

2403
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:00,780
OK, you remember when we were all in studio playing

2404
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,820
with that word rearranger thing?

2405
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:03,780
In the chat here.

2406
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:04,280
Oh, yeah.

2407
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,180
And she made one that said, Orange Lounge Radio

2408
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:09,180
owns everything including bleached zombie butts.

2409
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:09,580
I remember that.

2410
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,300
It was one of those fridge magnet site things

2411
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:11,800
where you could have your own stuff.

2412
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,940
That's part of my signature on Gorilla's Unofficial.

2413
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:16,260
Good times.

2414
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:17,580
Yeah.

2415
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,500
I totally stole it from Roz.

2416
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,020
Yeah, except I disappeared from there, too.

2417
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:24,580
I noticed that, too, Missy.

2418
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,980
So you're going to hang out more, right?

2419
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:30,020
Well, you've been busy with school, though, right?

2420
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:31,660
Not really.

2421
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:34,540
Actually, I've been busy with medical problems.

2422
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:36,420
Sorry to hear that.

2423
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,960
Oh, it's not any different from usual.

2424
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:40,460
I'm pretty much used to it.

2425
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,460
Well, you shouldn't have to be used to that, but.

2426
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,380
It happens.

2427
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:46,700
Yeah, I can sympathize.

2428
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,100
I had my problems last year.

2429
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,820
Oh, yeah.

2430
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,700
I have drugs for that now.

2431
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:55,300
Luckily, the video game addiction thing

2432
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:58,220
didn't go through, or I might have a medical problem as well.

2433
01:37:58,220 --> 01:37:59,380
I've got a medical problem.

2434
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:01,660
It's called Robitis, which would technically

2435
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:05,500
mean inflammation of the rob.

2436
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:08,540
Rob, are you inflamed?

2437
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:10,620
Girl, are you trying to say I'm flaming?

2438
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,500
I don't know what you're trying to say, girl,

2439
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:13,540
but you're making me mad.

2440
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:19,700
I was inflamed.

2441
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:20,460
Oh, my.

2442
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,420
Roz, before this show gets ruined anymore

2443
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:23,260
with your phone call.

2444
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:23,920
No, I'm kidding.

2445
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,300
I'm totally kidding.

2446
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,660
But this show is off the T-bed.

2447
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:32,380
No, anything else you want to say to our listeners, Roz?

2448
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:34,340
Hi, everyone in chat.

2449
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:38,020
Everyone who's not in chat, screw you.

2450
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:40,700
That's a very nice thing to say to the people on the podcast.

2451
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:41,500
No, it's all good.

2452
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,500
No, I love everyone.

2453
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,660
For dinner.

2454
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,300
Maybe a little.

2455
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:50,420
All right, well.

2456
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:53,300
Happy little anniversary, Chindig.

2457
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:58,860
I thought I'd get back to the planet to join you for this.

2458
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,940
Ground control to Major Tom.

2459
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:03,100
Something like that.

2460
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,580
Well, we appreciate you, and you're

2461
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,020
a very down-to-earth phone call.

2462
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:07,140
We really appreciate that.

2463
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:08,300
Thanks for calling, Roz.

2464
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,780
We miss you.

2465
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:10,380
I know you did.

2466
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,660
But my aim's improving.

2467
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,620
Bye, Roz.

2468
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,340
Take care.

2469
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,140
Take care.

2470
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:16,500
Bye-bye.

2471
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,380
It's nice to hear from a girl.

2472
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,060
What is that about?

2473
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:23,100
How many times does the girl gamer topic come up here?

2474
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:27,180
How does it feel, Dark Sakura, to be a girl in a very

2475
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:30,460
manly-dominated scene, as if we don't ask this question?

2476
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,860
Wait till I have cramps.

2477
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,860
It all depends on my hormonal level that much.

2478
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:36,700
Then we'll all be hurting.

2479
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,180
Exactly.

2480
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,020
Let's go to another call.

2481
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:40,660
Loki, you awake?

2482
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:41,980
I'm awake.

2483
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:43,140
You bored?

2484
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,140
Can I get you something?

2485
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:45,220
I was playing blocks, or something.

2486
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:45,500
All right.

2487
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:48,140
Well, you're going to take this call, OK, Loki?

2488
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:50,620
Hello, this is Orange Launch Radio.

2489
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:51,140
Who is this?

2490
01:39:51,140 --> 01:39:51,780
Hello?

2491
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,820
Hello.

2492
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,980
Hello, it's Chaving Mon.

2493
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:55,180
Hey, how's it going?

2494
01:39:55,180 --> 01:39:56,020
Hi.

2495
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:57,260
You?

2496
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:58,180
I actually got through.

2497
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:00,380
I didn't think this would ever happen.

2498
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:01,900
So my question's for Rob.

2499
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,420
Yes, sir.

2500
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:08,260
Would Flaming Finger ever work on the DS?

2501
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:11,500
Only if it has a soundtrack with the quality of the

2502
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,500
original Flaming Finger.

2503
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,260
For those that have never played Flaming Finger, because

2504
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:17,540
I have to give background now, Flaming Finger is one of those

2505
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,260
ticket spitter games.

2506
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:20,980
And I've always seen them ever in two places.

2507
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:23,420
Dave and Busters, just about every Dave and Busters I've

2508
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:24,900
ever walked into has one of these machines.

2509
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,380
And randomly, Sunnyvale Golf Land had one.

2510
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:32,100
And you use your finger to navigate through this maze.

2511
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:35,060
And the game totally cheats, because as you get like

2512
01:40:35,060 --> 01:40:37,700
3-4ths of the way through the maze, the clock starts

2513
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:39,340
counting down much faster.

2514
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,740
But it's got this very distinctive

2515
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:42,020
rave beat to the game.

2516
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:42,940
And it is still f-

2517
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,340
Flaming Finger.

2518
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,740
And of course, all the homosexual jokes you can make

2519
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:49,740
with it, tee hee gay, tee hee flaming, ha ha ha.

2520
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:50,660
Get your flame on.

2521
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:51,900
Get your flame on.

2522
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:59,020
And yeah, I kind of froze up and don't know what to say.

2523
01:40:59,020 --> 01:40:59,540
That's it?

2524
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:00,780
That's all you want to say?

2525
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:01,820
You want to ask if I gave up on you?

2526
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,580
I've been trying to get through all night, and I

2527
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:04,460
finally did.

2528
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:07,900
Just to ask if I enjoy Flaming Finger, or if it would come

2529
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,540
out on the DS.

2530
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:12,940
I also wanted to congratulate you guys for five years.

2531
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:15,980
I remember listening to the first episode, and I was a

2532
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:17,220
complete douchebag back then.

2533
01:41:17,220 --> 01:41:21,540
You guys actually banned me from the chat room.

2534
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:24,700
We banned JV Mon from chat during the first episode.

2535
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:25,420
That's amazing.

2536
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:28,140
He's since proven himself.

2537
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:30,120
Which rehab works.

2538
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,940
Yeah.

2539
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:32,780
Crying and mowing the lawn.

2540
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:34,420
OLR rehab.

2541
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:37,060
I don't know about that, but I'd also like to thank Jamie

2542
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:39,620
for introducing me to Doctor Who, my new form of crack.

2543
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:43,100
Yeah, I'm getting people addicted.

2544
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,580
He's also one of the people I talk to every

2545
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:47,340
day online, too, now.

2546
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:48,940
Yes, Jamie's my new online BFF.

2547
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,860
And thanks for lunch in New York City, JV Mon.

2548
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,940
I appreciate that.

2549
01:41:55,940 --> 01:41:59,280
And I wasn't the one that banned you from chat, was I?

2550
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,260
No, I think it was Jamie.

2551
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:01,700
OK, well, you know she does that.

2552
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,460
Well, I do that all the time.

2553
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:06,820
With her enormous pan hammer.

2554
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:07,980
It's all good.

2555
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:10,500
Hey, actually, JV Mon, I want to ask you a question, because

2556
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,660
a lot's changed in five years.

2557
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,380
I hope you don't mind me saying on the program, but

2558
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:16,260
you're the first person that's called in that I also recognize

2559
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:18,420
as another gay gamer, right?

2560
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,180
And that's where I am, too.

2561
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:21,700
And even though the topic doesn't come up all the time

2562
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:26,140
on this show, do you think there's been progress for us

2563
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,620
in gaming in the past five years?

2564
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:29,740
Like, you know how, especially five years ago, you sat on

2565
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:34,860
the Xbox Live, it's fag, fag, fag, fag, gay, gay, that's gay.

2566
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:36,900
Do you think there's been any progress?

2567
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:41,660
Because I notice the visibility of the gaygamer.net and a lot

2568
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:44,260
of those gay gaming communities, it seems like

2569
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:47,780
there's an awful lot more people out there now that will

2570
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:49,160
admit they're gay in the gaming scene than

2571
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:49,780
there used to be.

2572
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:52,300
I don't know if it's just me, but what do you think?

2573
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,740
I just think that over time has passed, people have just

2574
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,940
been more accepting about it, because they

2575
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:59,060
can't hide it anymore.

2576
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:00,820
It's just there and it's out there.

2577
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,060
It's either you got with the times or you

2578
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:03,140
just got left behind.

2579
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:05,460
So in other words, if you've put it on your MySpace profile

2580
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:08,180
somewhere, somebody's going to find it, and they know.

2581
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:08,700
Very much.

2582
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:11,380
If you put it on MySpace, it's on the internet.

2583
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:12,940
It's like trying to get pee out of a pool.

2584
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:21,980
Do you think that it might be a mirror of society, where

2585
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:25,660
maybe there's been a more general acceptance of gay

2586
01:43:25,660 --> 01:43:28,140
lifestyle and gay culture in society?

2587
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:29,460
Yeah, for sure.

2588
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,300
I think that might have a little bit to do with it, too.

2589
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,620
Because when I was in high school, you didn't dare tell

2590
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:35,700
anybody you were gay in high school, because you'd get

2591
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:36,620
killed, practically.

2592
01:43:36,620 --> 01:43:38,260
I mean, not necessarily killed, but just beaten half

2593
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:38,820
to death.

2594
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:42,740
But now in this day and age, God, I talk to my mom used to

2595
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,020
work for the choir teacher.

2596
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:47,020
And obviously, I'm not saying this about all guys, but there

2597
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,740
are a lot of guys that join choir that have homosexual

2598
01:43:49,740 --> 01:43:50,380
tendencies.

2599
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:52,820
And the choir teacher tells my mom that these days, the gay

2600
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:55,220
guys are the most popular ones in school.

2601
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:57,500
And it's because of those shows on TV, like Queer Eye,

2602
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,300
even though it's not my kind of show.

2603
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,580
It just kind of gives visibility.

2604
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:02,020
So I don't know.

2605
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:03,580
I guess we're talking about something a lot bigger than

2606
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:06,140
gaming, so I should probably hang up on you now.

2607
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:06,900
Only if you want.

2608
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:07,500
All right.

2609
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,420
You're the one to stop the rest of your life.

2610
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:09,900
All right.

2611
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:14,260
Well, take care, JVmon, and yeah, thanks for calling.

2612
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:14,860
No problem.

2613
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:16,620
You'll be getting CDs from me in like two weeks.

2614
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,100
Sweet.

2615
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:18,780
I love CDs.

2616
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:22,140
All right, I'll let you have more important calls.

2617
01:44:22,140 --> 01:44:23,020
All right.

2618
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:24,980
It's just more calls, JVmon.

2619
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:27,020
No one call is more important than the other.

2620
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:27,540
All right.

2621
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:27,940
All right.

2622
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:28,860
Take care.

2623
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:29,380
You, too.

2624
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:30,500
Bye-bye.

2625
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:34,980
Now we have people in chat that are like, I'm in choir.

2626
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:35,460
I'm not gay.

2627
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:37,020
I didn't say all.

2628
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:38,620
I just said a lot.

2629
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:42,540
Not even a lot, but you have to admit that there are, I

2630
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:45,660
don't know, at least when I was in high school, at least

2631
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,580
half the guys in choir were a little bit fruity.

2632
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:49,580
And I would think it's still that way, too.

2633
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:51,620
I'm not saying they all are.

2634
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:52,220
Back off.

2635
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:55,340
God, now we're going to get emails and everything, too.

2636
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:58,300
Dark soccer, weren't you in choir?

2637
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:01,060
I was until they made me sing with the boys,

2638
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:03,140
because I had a low voice.

2639
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,860
Gay boys or straight boys?

2640
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:07,260
This was church.

2641
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,420
Oh, never mind.

2642
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:09,020
That's different.

2643
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:10,700
Well, no, I did chorus for two weeks,

2644
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,940
but I was supposed to be in band.

2645
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:13,900
That's a whole other can of worms.

2646
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:14,500
Yeah, I know.

2647
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,340
All right.

2648
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:17,420
Let's go to another call.

2649
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,820
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2650
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:19,500
Who's this?

2651
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,020
Hey, this is Black Devil or X.

2652
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,900
Hi, Black Devil or X. You're a little bit quiet.

2653
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,020
Make sure you're talking right in the mic.

2654
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:25,020
What's on your mind?

2655
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,260
Um, not much.

2656
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:32,220
Gosh, I'm hearing a ringing in the background, but that's OK.

2657
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:32,780
I hear that.

2658
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,220
That's weird.

2659
01:45:33,220 --> 01:45:33,820
We hear it, too.

2660
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:34,300
That's OK.

2661
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:34,940
Keep trying.

2662
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:37,820
What's on your mind?

2663
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:40,940
I don't know if you called in last week,

2664
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:43,780
or if you remember, I called in a couple of weeks ago.

2665
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:47,260
I was trying to get a wee, and I finally got one.

2666
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:48,340
You finally got a wee?

2667
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:51,340
It sounds like someone's drinking a Slurpee over there

2668
01:45:51,340 --> 01:45:52,380
or something, doesn't it?

2669
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,420
I can't figure that.

2670
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:53,920
I'm sorry.

2671
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,500
I'm playing with something else here.

2672
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,420
I'll pop it away.

2673
01:45:56,420 --> 01:45:57,140
That's why we hear it.

2674
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,860
I swear to God, it's like we hear a Slurpee

2675
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:00,900
or in the background or something, or like a bong.

2676
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:01,900
Are you smoking weed?

2677
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:03,380
No, I am not smoking weed.

2678
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:04,220
All right, OK.

2679
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:05,300
Are you smoking crack?

2680
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:05,800
All right.

2681
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:06,300
Oh.

2682
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,420
All right.

2683
01:46:07,420 --> 01:46:08,220
We're just kidding.

2684
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,660
You don't smoke crack in a bong, nor did I.

2685
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:14,420
Anyway, not that I'd know.

2686
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,380
So you finally got a wee?

2687
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:17,140
I did.

2688
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:18,020
Congratulations.

2689
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:19,540
How did you manage to do it?

2690
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:24,620
I actually had to buy it in a bundle with two other games

2691
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:28,940
and another re-remote.

2692
01:46:28,940 --> 01:46:31,220
And where did you get this bundle at?

2693
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:34,260
I got this bundle at the Virgin Megastore.

2694
01:46:34,260 --> 01:46:35,620
So a forced bundle.

2695
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:37,540
What do you think about forced bundles?

2696
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:39,100
I don't like them.

2697
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,020
But you bought one anyway.

2698
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:43,300
I just really don't like them, especially

2699
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:46,700
when the game selections suck.

2700
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:49,860
Rob D says he had to buy it in a bundle with a phone that

2701
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:50,740
wouldn't stop ringing.

2702
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:59,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2703
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:00,460
What?

2704
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:02,100
You probably can't hear it on your end,

2705
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:05,340
but we keep hearing this little, it's like a Slurpee or a ring

2706
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,860
or something, like every two seconds.

2707
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:07,980
It's so funny.

2708
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,660
Anyway, so are you happy now that you got a wee?

2709
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:13,980
Have you actually been playing it?

2710
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:15,540
Well, the two games that I had to get

2711
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:20,420
were Power Ultimate Alliance and Spider-Man 3.

2712
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:20,940
Very good.

2713
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:24,620
And you didn't opt for Zelda or Trauma Center and that stuff?

2714
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:25,580
They didn't have Zelda.

2715
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:26,920
They didn't have Trauma Center.

2716
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:31,540
I mean, their game selection just sucked.

2717
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:33,140
They had Cooking Mama.

2718
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:35,300
Well, Cooking Mama's a little bit better on the DS

2719
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:39,140
than it is on the Wii, to be honest.

2720
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:42,220
OK, so the main thing I wanted to do tonight

2721
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,980
while I was calling in was back when I was listening,

2722
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:47,220
I think a couple of years ago before I had kind of the Sunday

2723
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:50,740
night commitment, and I dropped out and I'm sorry,

2724
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:56,420
was to open a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.

2725
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:01,500
And here I am opening a pint of chocolate cookie dough ice

2726
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,500
cream.

2727
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:04,660
In your honor, this is like my little toast.

2728
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:05,700
Here we go.

2729
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,700
All right, five beers.

2730
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,220
Here, I'm clanking my empty champagne glass

2731
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:11,140
to your cookie dough ice cream.

2732
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:12,220
There you go.

2733
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:15,660
My stomach is digesting in honor of your ice cream.

2734
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,060
All right.

2735
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:18,220
We got to let you go, buddy.

2736
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,660
That ringing is driving me nuts.

2737
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,780
But thank you very much for the call.

2738
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,620
And listen to the playback on the podcast,

2739
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:24,740
because it's hilarious.

2740
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,300
Banana phone.

2741
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:26,800
Bye.

2742
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,300
Bye.

2743
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,300
Jamie.

2744
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:35,980
Oh, well, all of a sudden, all the calls disappeared.

2745
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:37,100
Oh, here they come again.

2746
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:37,600
Oh, good.

2747
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,100
Oh, damn.

2748
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:38,600
I mean, hi.

2749
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:42,100
Dark Sakura, here you go.

2750
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:43,500
Hey, this is Jonathan Fields.

2751
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,260
How you doing?

2752
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:45,140
Hi.

2753
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,420
Who?

2754
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:47,300
John Fields.

2755
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,380
Oh, hi.

2756
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:50,340
You were on the show like a long-ass time ago.

2757
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:53,020
He's the guy that flew out here like all the way from,

2758
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:54,780
like, what, Connecticut you're at?

2759
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:55,740
Yeah, Connecticut.

2760
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:57,420
I'm in New Jersey now.

2761
01:48:57,420 --> 01:48:59,980
But I was there back when Tech TV was still around.

2762
01:48:59,980 --> 01:49:00,860
I remember that.

2763
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:02,380
I remember you came to the show.

2764
01:49:02,380 --> 01:49:04,340
Do you remember what episode number that was?

2765
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:06,580
I don't remember off the top of my head,

2766
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:12,540
but it was like the year before G4 bought him out.

2767
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,900
OK, so it was probably in the low 100s, right,

2768
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:16,380
about the time you were there?

2769
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,060
Maybe 469.

2770
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:19,020
I'm trying to remember.

2771
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:19,520
Wow.

2772
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,900
OK, but you came to the show a long time ago.

2773
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:24,020
And yeah, you toured Tech TV.

2774
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:26,220
I remember, because that was one of the big things

2775
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,700
we were talking to you about on that show.

2776
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,260
I remember you, and I remember the show.

2777
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:31,560
And I remember we were talking about the whole Tech TV.

2778
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:34,420
So goddamn, a lot's changed since then, huh?

2779
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:35,380
I know.

2780
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:36,460
Everything's changed.

2781
01:49:36,460 --> 01:49:38,020
I mean, your format has changed.

2782
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:43,300
I mean, Magus has changed his name, all that sort of stuff.

2783
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:45,740
And to be totally honest, you guys

2784
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:49,140
are lucky that the anniversary is happening today,

2785
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:50,060
and not yesterday.

2786
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:52,140
Because otherwise, you'd be facing against a big hedge

2787
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:53,300
hard.

2788
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:55,300
Wait, what's yesterday?

2789
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,620
Sonic's birthday.

2790
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:01,220
Well, you know, technically, the show started on June 23rd.

2791
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:03,940
So yesterday was our birthday, but we celebrate it tonight

2792
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,620
because it's Sunday.

2793
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:07,380
Exactly.

2794
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:09,940
So there you go.

2795
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:13,180
I was wondering, actually, Rob, did you ever

2796
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:16,140
watch any of the big gaming cartoons way,

2797
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:17,340
way back in the 80s?

2798
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:20,620
I watched the Super Mario Brothers Super Show religiously

2799
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,980
every day after school, and would also

2800
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:24,820
watch the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.

2801
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:25,660
That was my show.

2802
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:28,160
I didn't really watch Captain Anne or any of the other ones,

2803
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,980
but that was the one.

2804
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:31,780
Did you know that the stuff is on DVD now?

2805
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:33,540
Yes, I have the second season on DVD.

2806
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,400
I need to find the first.

2807
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,020
You could probably find it on Amazon.

2808
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:38,780
I really need to get the Zelda DVD, too.

2809
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:40,100
For some reason, I just never bought it.

2810
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,980
I've been busy watching all these other shows,

2811
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:44,620
but I definitely want the Zelda DVD package as well.

2812
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:46,980
I keep seeing that one every time I go on Amazon,

2813
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:49,340
so they keep recommending it to me.

2814
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:52,700
So you can probably find it easy.

2815
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:54,900
You kind of brought up the whole tech TV thing,

2816
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,940
and you've been talking a lot about television.

2817
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:00,820
I'm kind of curious because it's funny, a lot has changed there.

2818
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,180
Tell us really quick again, what would you say some

2819
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:06,620
of your experiences at the tech TV studios when you went?

2820
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:08,300
What kind of stuff did you observe?

2821
01:51:08,300 --> 01:51:11,140
Do people seem to be enjoying themselves?

2822
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:13,860
How was the tour when you went?

2823
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:17,420
Well, basically what it was like was I basically

2824
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:22,980
went into the headquarters where the main shows were developed there.

2825
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:26,220
I got to meet Adam Sessler.

2826
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:29,660
I pretty much walked around where everybody's office space was,

2827
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:33,540
and I've still got a few tech TV schwag stuff.

2828
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:34,740
That's pretty rad.

2829
01:51:34,740 --> 01:51:36,660
Those are collector's things now.

2830
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:37,340
I know.

2831
01:51:37,340 --> 01:51:42,100
And then after that, I took a little shuttle over to the studio,

2832
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:47,180
and I sat in on an episode of The Screensavers.

2833
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,860
Wow, that's great.

2834
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:50,380
That's cool.

2835
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:53,220
And it's kind of sad now that that show's gone.

2836
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:56,260
My dad loved The Screensavers too, and it was a really great show.

2837
01:51:56,260 --> 01:51:59,100
It's just kind of sad to see what happened in the end, all that stuff.

2838
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:02,300
But Leo and the gang, they're also around.

2839
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:05,700
They're just doing a show now called This Week in Tech.

2840
01:52:05,700 --> 01:52:06,820
Oh, yeah.

2841
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:09,740
If you're in the podcasting biz, you know This Week in Tech.

2842
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:12,620
It's huge.

2843
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:13,620
It's a huge show.

2844
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:16,780
Leo also has a KFI show in California.

2845
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:20,060
I'm glad to see he's still kicking, because folks like him

2846
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:22,620
are the kind of folks that inspire us.

2847
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:23,140
I know.

2848
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:27,020
And if G4 hadn't bought out tech TV, I'd probably be working there now.

2849
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:29,420
I know, it's kind of weird, because I kind of start to think,

2850
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:31,500
wow, tech TV was just right over in San Francisco.

2851
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:32,900
We all know which building.

2852
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:36,020
We go to San Francisco at least once a month, if not more.

2853
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:36,780
I don't know.

2854
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:37,860
But it's kind of weird.

2855
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:40,020
It's like I feel like I would have toured the building by now,

2856
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:42,380
and who knows what could have happened.

2857
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:43,900
This is weird.

2858
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:46,220
All right, well, hey, thanks so much for the call.

2859
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,100
And anything else you want to say to the listeners tonight?

2860
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:51,500
Happy fifth anniversary, and a happy 5-4.

2861
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,660
And it's so good to hear from call, because I

2862
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:54,860
know you haven't been listening.

2863
01:52:54,860 --> 01:52:56,900
At least you haven't been in chat for a long time.

2864
01:52:56,900 --> 01:53:00,380
It's really refreshing tonight to hear from folks blast from the past

2865
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:00,860
as well.

2866
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:02,180
So thank you so much for listening tonight.

2867
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:03,500
Yeah, I've tried to catch them.

2868
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,700
I just keep forgetting to catch it on Saturday.

2869
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:07,060
But I'm glad I caught it tonight.

2870
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:07,780
It's all good.

2871
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:09,660
We know that things change.

2872
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:11,260
So have a good one, buddy.

2873
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:11,900
Yeah, you too.

2874
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:12,400
Bye-bye.

2875
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:17,180
We've hit the two-hour mark.

2876
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:19,060
But of course, that counts the bonus segment,

2877
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:22,260
which was a good 10 minutes long, which the podcasters don't get to hear.

2878
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:24,340
So we're going to take a few more calls?

2879
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:25,020
A few more?

2880
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:25,580
OK.

2881
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,300
All right, let's keep going.

2882
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,540
Are you guys OK on time and everything?

2883
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:28,860
Is anybody trying to get a pumpkin?

2884
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:29,900
Yeah, I've only got to work overtime.

2885
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:30,460
Oh, I'm sorry.

2886
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:30,740
No, it's OK.

2887
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:31,180
It's cool.

2888
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:31,940
I'm joking.

2889
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:33,060
Tonight's a special night.

2890
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:35,780
All right, Loki, your call.

2891
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:38,960
Hello, who is this?

2892
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:39,460
Hello.

2893
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:40,300
Hello.

2894
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:42,700
This is Dr. Patzco City.

2895
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,220
How's it going?

2896
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:46,060
Ah, just great.

2897
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:48,140
Hooray, more international listeners.

2898
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:49,900
We love hearing from the international folks.

2899
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:54,140
Let you know that I just love the show the last, Journey to Health.

2900
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:55,540
Well, we really appreciate that.

2901
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:58,380
Thank you very much for listening to us for the past year and a half.

2902
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:00,660
Any highlights from our show?

2903
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:04,820
Actually, what I do have is a question.

2904
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:07,180
Oh, what's that?

2905
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:08,540
What's with the name?

2906
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:12,940
I assume you did have an orange lounge.

2907
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:14,380
No.

2908
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,500
Where did that come from?

2909
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:18,620
You know what, very famous question we often get asked a lot,

2910
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:21,780
especially since we've started getting more listeners since we

2911
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:23,740
moved into the general gaming chat.

2912
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:26,260
Because anybody that played the Monty games probably

2913
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:27,980
knows where the name comes from.

2914
01:54:27,980 --> 01:54:31,500
But Jamie, I'll let you take this one because you helped come up

2915
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:32,540
with the name.

2916
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:35,460
Oh, yeah, where we got our name from.

2917
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:40,300
We were like on the train coming into San Francisco for something

2918
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,060
or the other.

2919
01:54:41,060 --> 01:54:43,260
We were going to the Metreon that day, right?

2920
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:47,560
And we had been trying to think of all day a name for the station.

2921
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:51,380
And when we came back, I was like, we should call it Orange Lounge Radio

2922
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:54,940
because it's Orange Lounge music.

2923
01:54:54,940 --> 01:54:57,900
I seem to remember suggesting that we should name it

2924
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:59,220
after something Bamani related.

2925
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:00,300
After one of the groups.

2926
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:04,860
Like a Beatles tribute band would be named Yellow Submarine or something

2927
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:05,900
like that, right?

2928
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:09,260
So Orange Lounge is actually a band that's in Bamani.

2929
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:11,060
And they do some of the songs.

2930
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:15,340
Their most famous song is probably Mobo Moga from BeatMania 2DX6 style.

2931
01:55:15,340 --> 01:55:19,700
And it's actually, you kind of hear the song remixed in our podcast

2932
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:21,940
as incidental music.

2933
01:55:21,940 --> 01:55:24,860
And we're very thankful to Konami for not suing us for using the name.

2934
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:27,540
But I think they realized we gave them free advertising

2935
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:29,260
and still continue to do so for a long time.

2936
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:32,260
So an Orange Lounge radio is different from Orange Lounge.

2937
01:55:32,260 --> 01:55:33,820
So there you go.

2938
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:37,700
Well, that just goes to show you that I have absolutely not

2939
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,380
a care for music games.

2940
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:40,460
It's all good.

2941
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:41,660
Some of our listeners don't.

2942
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,780
And that's just fine.

2943
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:49,620
So we try to, we, sorry, Jamie was showing me a private message.

2944
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:50,300
Don't do that.

2945
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:52,180
You distract me during the show.

2946
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:55,740
Yeah, but it just goes to show we love the fact

2947
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:58,700
that since we have done the merge, even though not everybody was supportive

2948
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:00,860
when we kind of did away with talking about Bamani,

2949
01:56:00,860 --> 01:56:02,620
only talking about general gaming, I really

2950
01:56:02,620 --> 01:56:05,540
love that we've kind of opened it up to a whole new audience as well.

2951
01:56:05,540 --> 01:56:08,740
And it's not just about the music games.

2952
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,100
OK, then.

2953
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:12,740
Probably I'll give you a call the next time I get to Santa Cruz.

2954
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:14,340
I have a present for you guys.

2955
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:15,100
Ah, sweet.

2956
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:15,620
Thank you.

2957
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,500
And I love Santa Cruz.

2958
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,940
I love the boardwalk there.

2959
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:19,380
We'll have to go to the arcades.

2960
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:19,940
Awesome.

2961
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:20,820
I love the arcades.

2962
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,620
They are awesome.

2963
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:23,140
They have Discs of Tron.

2964
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:23,740
Sweet.

2965
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:24,380
They do.

2966
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,260
That they do.

2967
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:25,580
All right.

2968
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,660
Well, thank you very much for your call.

2969
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:27,900
We appreciate it, buddy.

2970
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:28,400
No worries.

2971
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:29,020
See you later.

2972
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:30,620
Bye bye.

2973
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:32,860
So refreshing to hear from the folks around the world.

2974
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:33,780
It's so great.

2975
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:36,260
How come we haven't had any Canadians tonight?

2976
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:37,140
That's very strange.

2977
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:38,380
We want Canadians to call next.

2978
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:39,420
We want Canadians.

2979
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:40,140
All right.

2980
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:41,620
I declare there must be Canadians.

2981
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:45,380
Not that we don't love the Argentina, the Mexico, the US, you know.

2982
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:48,820
But Europe might be asking a bit much because it's probably like what now?

2983
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:50,940
It's like the sun's starting to rise over there.

2984
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:52,180
But what about some Canadians?

2985
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:53,700
I know there's got to be a few listening.

2986
01:56:53,700 --> 01:56:53,860
All right.

2987
01:56:53,860 --> 01:56:54,980
Let's go to another call.

2988
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:56,360
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2989
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,460
Who's this?

2990
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:59,220
Hello, this is Jayden.

2991
01:56:59,220 --> 01:57:01,380
I'm sorry, who?

2992
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:02,420
Jayden.

2993
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:04,300
Hi, what's on your mind?

2994
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:04,860
Nothing much.

2995
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:08,500
I just wanted to congratulate you on your fifth.

2996
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,580
Well, thank you very much.

2997
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:12,220
I have my fifth beer.

2998
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:12,900
Pardon?

2999
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:13,500
Nothing.

3000
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,460
I was saying my fifth beer.

3001
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,060
I do that all the time.

3002
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:18,900
I know.

3003
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:23,740
Well, thank you very much.

3004
01:57:23,740 --> 01:57:28,300
Is there a particular something something that you want to share with listeners tonight?

3005
01:57:28,300 --> 01:57:32,420
Like, how long have you been listening to this show?

3006
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:33,100
Let's see.

3007
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:35,780
I think this is going on my third beer.

3008
01:57:35,780 --> 01:57:36,380
Awesome.

3009
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:40,260
Well, what do you think has been a big, big game story that you really enjoyed our coverage

3010
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:44,180
on in the past three years?

3011
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:48,780
The anticipation of the Xbox 360.

3012
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:51,780
Ah, the anticipation of the Xbox 360.

3013
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:54,420
You know, I wasn't sold on the Xbox 360 at first.

3014
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,700
I really wasn't.

3015
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:00,620
And also the introduction of new systems in general.

3016
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:05,460
Oh, kind of like being able to kind of be watching this new wave of the whole next gen

3017
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:09,620
systems, kind of watch this unfold because, you know, all these systems didn't exist,

3018
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,180
the PS3, the Wii, the 360 back when we started.

3019
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:16,100
Hell, I don't even think the Xbox existed when we first started, or maybe it had just

3020
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:17,100
come out.

3021
01:58:17,100 --> 01:58:18,100
I don't know.

3022
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:19,100
I think it was out.

3023
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,100
When did the Xbox come out?

3024
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:21,100
2001?

3025
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:22,100
So maybe it was just out.

3026
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:24,260
So, but anyway, yeah, we kind of got to watch this all unfold.

3027
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:25,260
I don't know.

3028
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:28,820
Loki, what, you bought a 360 the day they came out, right?

3029
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:29,820
No.

3030
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:30,820
You bought a bidded one.

3031
01:58:30,820 --> 01:58:31,820
You eBay'd one or something.

3032
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:33,820
I bought it off of Craigslist for like twice as what it's worth.

3033
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:36,460
Oh, I remember getting so mad at you about that.

3034
01:58:36,460 --> 01:58:37,660
But why did you do it?

3035
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:38,660
Was it the hype?

3036
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:39,660
Was it the games?

3037
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:45,220
I just wanted to talk about it, and I'm crazy, very crazy when it comes to talking about

3038
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:46,220
games and stuff.

3039
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:47,220
I don't know.

3040
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:50,860
I just felt like I wanted one.

3041
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:51,860
It was big.

3042
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:56,340
I got to keep my edge at work, you know?

3043
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:59,580
You know what sold me on Xbox 360, sad but true?

3044
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:03,260
Geometry Wars, and Xbox Live Arcade in general.

3045
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:07,340
I just was so, I was like, this is the coolest thing ever, and that's really what, so it

3046
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:11,060
wasn't even any of the launch games that I really cared, although I did buy like Cameo

3047
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:15,500
and I don't know what even else I bought at launch, but it was Xbox Live Arcade.

3048
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:19,580
I bought Cameo, Ridge Racer 6, actually I pretty much bought almost everything that

3049
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:27,660
came out at launch between launch and like March, because I bought, I remember, I think

3050
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:35,620
one of the big ones I bought was Call of Duty 2, and then I bought Project Gotham Racing

3051
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:45,020
3, also Cameo, and then Perfect Dark Zero, and I bought almost everything that came out

3052
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:46,020
at launch.

3053
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:47,020
Addict.

3054
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:50,700
No, caller, did you get in on the Xbox 360, Grace?

3055
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,980
No, I didn't.

3056
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:54,300
You didn't buy one until way later, huh?

3057
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:56,020
Or did you, do you even have one?

3058
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,220
No, I don't have one.

3059
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:58,220
Oh, wow.

3060
01:59:58,220 --> 02:00:00,220
Because I'm not an Xbox person.

3061
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:01,220
Huh.

3062
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:02,780
Well, you know, not everybody is.

3063
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:03,780
Well, then what are you?

3064
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,780
Are you a Nintendo person?

3065
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:07,100
I'm a Nintendo person.

3066
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:09,740
Ah, so did you camp out for a Wii?

3067
02:00:09,740 --> 02:00:10,740
No.

3068
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:12,740
You're not that crazy.

3069
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:15,500
No, I'm not that crazy.

3070
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,820
I thought about it at one point in time, but.

3071
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:20,820
I thought it was fun when we went to the Wii lines with cookies.

3072
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:25,060
I had a lot of fun listening, and actually I wanted to.

3073
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:26,740
We did Donuts and Coffee, me and Kristen.

3074
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:30,460
Yeah, I know, and we were doing Orange Soda, and then you guys one-upped us with the Donuts

3075
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:31,460
and Coffee.

3076
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:33,420
But they also let us skip up the line.

3077
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:34,420
That was awesome.

3078
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:38,580
And I still remember the line at the Target Great Land over on Sunrise.

3079
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:39,980
That's where we were.

3080
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:40,980
That was awesome.

3081
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:43,700
And we had a listener of the show on the line.

3082
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:44,700
A couple.

3083
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:46,360
I want to know if any of them are still listening.

3084
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:47,620
For the love of God, email us.

3085
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:48,620
Let's get together and play Wii sometime.

3086
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:51,920
I want to know who the girl who got the Wii hat was.

3087
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:52,920
I want to say hi to her.

3088
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:53,920
Somebody saw her later.

3089
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,460
I saw her at GameStop a while back.

3090
02:00:55,460 --> 02:00:56,460
You saw her, that's right.

3091
02:00:56,460 --> 02:00:58,300
If you guys are still listening, email us.

3092
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:03,060
Rob, Jamie, mailbag at orangedollasradio.com, any of that, and let's have you guys on the

3093
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:04,060
show at some point.

3094
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:06,820
We want to talk like the Wii six months later or whatever it is.

3095
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:07,820
Anyway, sorry, caller.

3096
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:08,820
I've been ignoring you.

3097
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:10,940
Is there anything else you want to share with our listeners?

3098
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:11,940
Let's see.

3099
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:14,940
DS's reaction to the DS.

3100
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:17,140
Funny enough.

3101
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:18,940
Dark Soccer's reaction to the DS.

3102
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:20,700
Something that shares your namesake.

3103
02:01:20,700 --> 02:01:22,260
Do you approve?

3104
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:23,300
I guess.

3105
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:25,100
It's almost as cool as me.

3106
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:28,380
Do you remember when we went and bought our DS?

3107
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:33,680
We went to Best Buy, bought them there, and then we also went to Benihana's afterwards

3108
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:35,780
for lunch.

3109
02:01:35,780 --> 02:01:37,620
Most money I've ever spent in a single day, probably.

3110
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:42,260
I found Dan's box for his DS, because they all got theirs at GameStop before launch date,

3111
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:43,260
of course.

3112
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,620
It said, this DS is reserved for Dan.

3113
02:01:45,620 --> 02:01:47,020
If you touch it, you die.

3114
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:48,020
I won't forget the first time.

3115
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:49,140
The post-it's still on the box.

3116
02:01:49,140 --> 02:01:53,100
The first PSP I bought, I bought it, and then I...

3117
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:54,100
What happened?

3118
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:58,140
Oh, I got a car accident that day, because I don't know.

3119
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:00,240
A slow moving car accident, by the way.

3120
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:03,260
I was moving under five miles an hour.

3121
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:04,260
That's amazing.

3122
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:05,260
It did.

3123
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:07,020
It dented up my fender, and that's about it.

3124
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:10,380
You know the DS is the only other system I've ever bought at launch, besides a Wii?

3125
02:02:10,380 --> 02:02:13,940
So, I bought the PSP a week after it came out.

3126
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:14,940
All right, sorry, caller.

3127
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:18,780
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

3128
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:19,780
Nope.

3129
02:02:19,780 --> 02:02:21,940
Other than the fact that I...

3130
02:02:21,940 --> 02:02:28,380
The one episode that really sticks out to me, because I have a recording of it, is 120.

3131
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:29,780
What's so special about 120?

3132
02:02:29,780 --> 02:02:32,340
You'll have to forgive us, but they all start to blend together when you've been doing it

3133
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:34,860
for five years.

3134
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:42,100
Because one of the big things is that Loki mis-called the Xbox the Xbox Two at the time.

3135
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:43,100
Did he?

3136
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:46,940
Well, they probably didn't have a name then.

3137
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:50,260
Did it have a name, or was he just being dumb?

3138
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:54,860
He didn't have a name for it, but he mentioned it several times.

3139
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:55,860
Interesting.

3140
02:02:55,860 --> 02:03:00,620
Well, I mean, if they don't have a name for it yet, obviously it's going to be the Xbox

3141
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:01,620
Two.

3142
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:04,940
But we need to go back and listen to what we thought about things before they actually

3143
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:05,940
came out.

3144
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:10,780
I wouldn't go like, I think they're going to be stupid and name it 360, because it'll

3145
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:11,780
be circular.

3146
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:12,780
I don't know.

3147
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:13,780
All right.

3148
02:03:13,780 --> 02:03:14,780
You called the PS3 name, right?

3149
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:18,780
Well, yeah, because they didn't innovate on their name.

3150
02:03:18,780 --> 02:03:20,660
We're going to put a three on there.

3151
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:21,660
Yeah.

3152
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:22,660
All right.

3153
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:25,300
Caller, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling.

3154
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:26,300
Yep, sure.

3155
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:27,300
You're done.

3156
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:28,300
All right, later.

3157
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:29,300
All right.

3158
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:30,300
Bye.

3159
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:31,300
Bye.

3160
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:32,300
We've got to let you go to get some more calls.

3161
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:33,300
Now it's starting to trickle up a little bit.

3162
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:36,680
We still have some people hammering us that have been since the beginning, so we'll get

3163
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:37,680
to everybody.

3164
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:41,300
We're going to keep calling until the calls stop coming in or we pass out tired, whichever

3165
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:42,300
happens first.

3166
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:44,060
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3167
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:45,060
Who's this?

3168
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:47,180
A token Canadian calling in.

3169
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:50,900
Hi, what's your name for those who don't know?

3170
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:51,900
It's Tochen.

3171
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:52,900
What's up, guys?

3172
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:53,900
Tochen, what's up?

3173
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:54,900
See?

3174
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:56,140
Ask and you shall receive.

3175
02:03:56,140 --> 02:03:57,660
We got a Canadian on the line.

3176
02:03:57,660 --> 02:03:59,540
Yay, thank you.

3177
02:03:59,540 --> 02:04:00,540
What else can I do?

3178
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:01,540
I don't know.

3179
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:02,540
Do a cartwheel.

3180
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:03,540
Say a boot.

3181
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:04,540
No, I'm kidding.

3182
02:04:04,540 --> 02:04:05,540
I'm totally kidding.

3183
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:06,540
I'll bring pizza or something.

3184
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:07,540
I don't know.

3185
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:10,540
Tochen, dude, anything you want to say?

3186
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:12,860
Are you only calling in because we forced you to, or is there anything you want to say

3187
02:04:12,860 --> 02:04:13,860
or ask or what?

3188
02:04:13,860 --> 02:04:14,860
No, no, no.

3189
02:04:14,860 --> 02:04:17,900
I want to be like everybody else and congratulate you on the five years.

3190
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:23,660
I'm probably not the longest listener, but I've been around for a while and I just haven't

3191
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:28,140
had the nerve to jump in the chat room as much as I should.

3192
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:31,340
Because you were on DDR Freak several years ago.

3193
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:32,780
You've been posting there a while, right?

3194
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:36,980
Yeah, we've got a small little thread for our DDR people.

3195
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:37,980
Sweet.

3196
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,560
The reason why I mention that is because obviously when our show first started, a large, large

3197
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,780
contingent of our listeners were all DDR Freak members and people from that community.

3198
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:50,180
So I do remember seeing your face around there back in the day, so.

3199
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:54,740
Yeah, the small little Nova Scotia thread for anybody who wants to go check it out.

3200
02:04:54,740 --> 02:04:56,740
We still got some life.

3201
02:04:56,740 --> 02:05:00,580
And the machines have not frozen over, contrary to popular belief.

3202
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:01,580
No they're not.

3203
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:07,020
But we've got to deal with some of the machine's issues because they're in bad shape.

3204
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:10,620
You know what my favorite thread on DDR Freak was always?

3205
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,620
Was the Antarctica thread.

3206
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:15,740
Yeah, that was pretty funny.

3207
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:20,200
Because nobody lives in Antarctica, of course there's not a DDR machine there.

3208
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:24,380
But it was funny because I guess J-Dog or whoever built the forums, in one of the forums

3209
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:28,760
it says, rest of the world DDR scene, and it just kind of throws all these kind of countries

3210
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:33,340
that weren't accounted for other places in one, and it says, what is this, South America

3211
02:05:33,340 --> 02:05:36,320
and then Antarctica.

3212
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:39,540
And somebody always makes this post like, dude, let's get together in Antarctica and

3213
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:41,300
play DDR.

3214
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:43,660
Stay warm.

3215
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:44,940
Try to keep moving.

3216
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:45,940
Exactly.

3217
02:05:45,940 --> 02:05:48,340
Well, Tochen, thanks for answering the call.

3218
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,500
We appreciate it.

3219
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:52,620
Any other last things you want to say?

3220
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:57,900
I want to just, how are you doing with, I know you played DDR and B-Money for a while.

3221
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:00,180
What's your favorite game that you've played throughout the years?

3222
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:04,000
Is it just B-Money or DDR stepping?

3223
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,740
My favorite music game that I've played in the past five years?

3224
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:08,740
Yeah.

3225
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:12,300
Absolutely, without a doubt, BeatMania 2DX8 style in the arcade.

3226
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:13,880
Oh, sexy.

3227
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:19,740
Because technically my favorite, favorite mix, music and all, would probably be sixth

3228
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:20,740
or seventh style.

3229
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:24,620
But the thing about eighth style is it had all those songs in it, and that was the machine

3230
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:30,540
that we had here locally for the little time we did, and such community events.

3231
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:34,400
And those that know me well know what a big ham I am.

3232
02:06:34,400 --> 02:06:36,740
One of my favorite things to do is host.

3233
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:39,720
When I was young, I always wanted to be a game show host, if it's not completely obvious

3234
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:43,180
through some of the things that happen on the show.

3235
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:47,420
That's part of the reason I continue to be an emcee-ish sort of role on this show.

3236
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:52,180
I love doing that kind of stuff at tournaments, and running the BeatMania 2DX tournament,

3237
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:55,700
one of the very few that's ever been run, being able to run that tournament on that

3238
02:06:55,700 --> 02:06:57,540
eighth style machine at Scandi was a dream.

3239
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:59,660
And the mix itself was awesome.

3240
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:05,620
The music that was in it and everything, just really the peak of the 2DX series for me.

3241
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:09,740
So are you planning to get distorted and stuff in the coming weeks?

3242
02:07:09,740 --> 02:07:13,540
Like I said, eighth was kind of the peak, and my interest in the series is kind of weighing

3243
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:14,540
since then.

3244
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:19,500
But I will always love the game, and I can't justify spending $80 on it.

3245
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:20,500
Not now, not right now.

3246
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:21,500
You can always...

3247
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:24,220
No, but I don't go there, you know.

3248
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:25,220
Maybe.

3249
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:26,220
I don't know.

3250
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:27,220
Import, man.

3251
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:28,220
Come on.

3252
02:07:28,220 --> 02:07:29,220
Well, let's see.

3253
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:30,220
I import from the internet.

3254
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:31,540
Straight to my hard drive.

3255
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:36,300
The Rob D says, from Bob Barker to Rob Roberts, dude, that would be my dream.

3256
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:40,600
I actually, secretly in the back of my mind, I secretly wish that they would do an American

3257
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:44,420
Idol style show to replace him, because I would so go there.

3258
02:07:44,420 --> 02:07:45,420
You know what we have to hear now?

3259
02:07:45,420 --> 02:07:48,340
We have to hear that song.

3260
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:49,340
Come on down?

3261
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:50,340
Yes.

3262
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:53,680
Maybe later in the show, because I don't have it queued up right now.

3263
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:56,740
You never have anything queued up at this time, though.

3264
02:07:56,740 --> 02:07:57,740
It's getting late.

3265
02:07:57,740 --> 02:07:58,740
Give me a break.

3266
02:07:58,740 --> 02:07:59,740
You need more pizza.

3267
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,740
All right.

3268
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:01,740
Take care.

3269
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:02,740
We ate it all.

3270
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:03,740
It's all gone.

3271
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:04,740
The three of us ate the whole damn pizza.

3272
02:08:04,740 --> 02:08:05,740
What?

3273
02:08:05,740 --> 02:08:06,740
A large.

3274
02:08:06,740 --> 02:08:07,740
A large?

3275
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:08,740
Oh, my God.

3276
02:08:08,740 --> 02:08:09,740
All right.

3277
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:10,740
Bye, Tosha.

3278
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:11,740
Thanks so much for the call.

3279
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,740
We appreciate it.

3280
02:08:12,740 --> 02:08:13,740
Yeah.

3281
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:14,740
Love that.

3282
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:18,740
Ask for a Canadian, and ye shall receive a Canadian.

3283
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:19,740
All right.

3284
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:25,180
We're well past the two-hour mark now, so we're going to go into the two-minute lightning

3285
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:28,500
round, and now all our calls are going to be wrapped up in two minutes or less.

3286
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,500
Here we go.

3287
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:30,500
Starting off.

3288
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:31,500
Jamie, your call.

3289
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:32,500
What?

3290
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:33,500
Hello?

3291
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:34,500
Hello.

3292
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:35,500
Hi.

3293
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:36,500
Hi.

3294
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:37,500
It's the Afro guy.

3295
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:38,500
Hi.

3296
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:39,500
Hi.

3297
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:40,500
What's on your mind?

3298
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:41,500
Afro guy.

3299
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:44,500
Hi.

3300
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:48,500
Turn down your speakers, buddy.

3301
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:49,500
Sorry.

3302
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:50,500
That's okay.

3303
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:51,500
That's okay.

3304
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,500
Are you calling us from the UK?

3305
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:53,500
Yeah.

3306
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,500
Ah, I knew it.

3307
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,500
I could tell from the accent.

3308
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:56,500
That's amazing.

3309
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:57,500
And I recognize your name, too.

3310
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:58,500
Wow.

3311
02:08:58,500 --> 02:08:59,500
So you're like, it's early morning.

3312
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:00,500
It's almost six in the morning, yeah.

3313
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,500
You are hard.

3314
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:02,500
What are you doing awake?

3315
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:03,500
We're listening to the fifth anniversary show.

3316
02:09:03,500 --> 02:09:12,980
Well, we appreciate you tuning in.

3317
02:09:12,980 --> 02:09:16,740
You are a hardcore fan, sir.

3318
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:19,380
I wish we weren't in the two-minute lightning round at this point.

3319
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:20,380
What do you want to say?

3320
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:24,380
I just want to say thanks for doing the show for five years.

3321
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:27,620
I mean, I've only been listening for about two years since starting the podcast.

3322
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:28,620
Well, you're welcome.

3323
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:32,620
I mean, we do this for folks like you that continue to listen in.

3324
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:37,380
And especially around the world, that blows my mind how the Internet brings us that closer

3325
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:39,380
together as gaming fans.

3326
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:40,380
Great.

3327
02:09:40,380 --> 02:09:44,620
Well, now I've cooled in, I think I'm going to go to bed.

3328
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:45,620
I'm so tired.

3329
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:46,620
All right.

3330
02:09:46,620 --> 02:09:47,620
I say that's a good call.

3331
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:48,620
Sleep in today.

3332
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:49,620
Sleep well.

3333
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:50,620
You've earned it, my friend.

3334
02:09:50,620 --> 02:09:51,620
Thank you.

3335
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:52,620
All right.

3336
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:53,620
Have a good one, buddy.

3337
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:54,620
All right.

3338
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:55,620
See you.

3339
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:56,620
See you.

3340
02:09:56,620 --> 02:09:57,620
Bye-bye.

3341
02:09:57,620 --> 02:10:00,860
Poor neighbors, because you must be blasting the show at 6 a.m. over there, because we're

3342
02:10:00,860 --> 02:10:01,860
hearing it on the speakers.

3343
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:04,740
Unless we had a room with an echo.

3344
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:05,740
Could be.

3345
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,740
That's right.

3346
02:10:06,740 --> 02:10:07,740
Yeah, it could be.

3347
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:08,740
It could be.

3348
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:09,740
Or he's trying to keep it down.

3349
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:10,740
I don't know.

3350
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:11,740
Who knows?

3351
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:12,740
All right.

3352
02:10:12,740 --> 02:10:13,740
Two-minute lighting around.

3353
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:14,740
Let's take some more calls.

3354
02:10:14,740 --> 02:10:15,740
Hi.

3355
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:16,740
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

3356
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:17,740
Who's this?

3357
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:18,740
Hello?

3358
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:19,740
Hi.

3359
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:20,740
You got through, finally.

3360
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:21,740
Who is this?

3361
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:22,740
Nintendo Maniac 64.

3362
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:23,740
Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.

3363
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:24,740
What's on your mind?

3364
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:25,740
I don't know.

3365
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:26,740
Not much.

3366
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:28,740
I guess I'm on the opposite side of the spectrum.

3367
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:29,740
It's not really morning.

3368
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:30,740
It's early.

3369
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:34,500
It's kind of late night, 1253 a.m. here.

3370
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:41,140
It's about 10 p.m. here, so we're getting pretty late, even for California time, but

3371
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:42,140
that's okay.

3372
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,140
What's on your mind?

3373
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:51,420
One thing I remember is something someone said, about your first game and stuff that

3374
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:52,420
you played.

3375
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:58,260
In all honesty, my very first game, I was like three or four something, was Mortal Kombat.

3376
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:01,220
Your first game was Mortal Kombat?

3377
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:03,780
I didn't even know what it was.

3378
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:06,820
Was it the version where they replaced the blood with the sweat, though, because that

3379
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:07,820
doesn't count?

3380
02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:08,820
It was the Genesis version.

3381
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:10,460
Oh, it was the Genesis version.

3382
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:12,020
So did you put in the blood code?

3383
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:15,340
I don't know.

3384
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:16,340
Only three or four.

3385
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:23,140
I didn't have my own game system until I was nine or something, or talking six when I got

3386
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:24,140
my mom's.

3387
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:25,140
I tried 2600.

3388
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:26,140
That didn't count.

3389
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:27,500
Quick question for you, because our time is limited.

3390
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:31,300
Have you ever killed anybody or beat anybody up to the point that they were bleeding and

3391
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:32,900
had to go to the hospital?

3392
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:33,900
I have no idea.

3393
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:35,620
I was way too young to remember anything.

3394
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:36,620
No, I mean, but now.

3395
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:37,620
I was Mortal Kombat.

3396
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:41,860
But as of now, have you ever killed anyone or sent anyone to the hospital in real life?

3397
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:42,860
No.

3398
02:11:42,860 --> 02:11:49,180
Well, I'm just trying to say that exposing kids to violent games doesn't necessarily

3399
02:11:49,180 --> 02:11:50,180
make them murderers.

3400
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:51,180
That's all.

3401
02:11:51,180 --> 02:11:52,180
All right.

3402
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:55,100
Anything else you want to share with listeners?

3403
02:11:55,100 --> 02:12:01,740
Oh, I finally got my own pretty good computer rake now, not like a 533 megahertz PC.

3404
02:12:01,740 --> 02:12:06,060
God, I thought he was going to say I got my own podcast.

3405
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:08,340
I don't have a podcast.

3406
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:09,340
That's all right.

3407
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:10,340
Two minutes is up, buddy.

3408
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:12,340
But thanks so much for the call, and take care, okay?

3409
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:13,340
Okay.

3410
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:14,340
All right.

3411
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:15,340
Bye-bye.

3412
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:16,340
Bye.

3413
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:17,340
All right.

3414
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:18,340
Let's go to another call.

3415
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:19,340
These poor people have been trying to get in all night long.

3416
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:20,340
We've got to get their calls.

3417
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,340
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

3418
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:22,340
Who's this?

3419
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:23,340
It's Dark Knight.

3420
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:25,260
It's Dark Knight.

3421
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:26,860
We can barely, barely hear you.

3422
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:27,860
Get a little closer to your night.

3423
02:12:27,860 --> 02:12:28,860
Is that Dark Knight?

3424
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:29,860
Yes, it's Dark Knight, but we can barely hear him.

3425
02:12:29,860 --> 02:12:30,860
Hello?

3426
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:31,860
Hey.

3427
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:32,860
Hey, what's on your mind?

3428
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:33,860
Quick shout out.

3429
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:34,860
What?

3430
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:43,180
Congratulations, y'all guys, on five years, and hope that y'all do five more years while

3431
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:45,780
y'all still around and everything like that.

3432
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:54,660
And to back-talk the gaming thing, my first game assistant was an Atari 2600.

3433
02:12:54,660 --> 02:12:55,660
Mine too.

3434
02:12:55,660 --> 02:12:56,660
Preach on.

3435
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:57,660
Atari 2600 was awesome.

3436
02:12:57,660 --> 02:13:00,460
And we'll try to do another five years if we can.

3437
02:13:00,460 --> 02:13:09,900
We're going to keep going until we're out of gas, but we'll do our best.

3438
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:15,020
So what was the first game you ever played on Atari 2600, do you remember?

3439
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:16,020
Asteroids.

3440
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:17,140
Good time.

3441
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:19,780
I was just playing that the other day on the PC.

3442
02:13:19,780 --> 02:13:21,260
Good times.

3443
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:22,740
It was a gift from my aunt.

3444
02:13:22,740 --> 02:13:24,820
My aunt bought me an Atari 2600.

3445
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:25,820
That was a Christmas gift.

3446
02:13:25,820 --> 02:13:26,820
Awesome.

3447
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:27,820
Yeah.

3448
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:28,820
I had it for years.

3449
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:34,180
But then after that, it was Sega Master System, Sega, everything else, till PlayStation.

3450
02:13:34,180 --> 02:13:38,340
Well Dark Knight, our time is halfway up, but I got to ask you real quickly, is there

3451
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:39,900
anything that you want to share?

3452
02:13:39,900 --> 02:13:42,020
Because I know you've been a long-time listener of Orange Andrea.

3453
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:44,780
I recognize your name from chat from years ago.

3454
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:47,660
Is there a favorite moment?

3455
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:51,500
Loki getting drunk and parents calling the show.

3456
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,220
When our parents have called in?

3457
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:56,220
Yeah, and Loki was the best one.

3458
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:57,980
Loki had the best parent call.

3459
02:13:57,980 --> 02:14:00,300
Yeah, because it was sister.

3460
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:02,580
Oh, it was sister.

3461
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:06,220
And then next thing you know, it was the parents behind her.

3462
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:07,220
I remember that.

3463
02:14:07,220 --> 02:14:08,220
Parents and grandparents.

3464
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:09,220
That was good.

3465
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:10,220
That was good.

3466
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:11,220
Dark Knight, our time is almost up.

3467
02:14:11,220 --> 02:14:12,220
Quick, any last minute thoughts?

3468
02:14:12,220 --> 02:14:17,900
No, just want to say I'm happy five years old and keep it rocking guys.

3469
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:19,180
All right, we will do it buddy.

3470
02:14:19,180 --> 02:14:20,940
Thanks so much for your support over the past five years.

3471
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:21,940
We appreciate it.

3472
02:14:21,940 --> 02:14:22,940
Thank you.

3473
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:23,940
Bye-bye.

3474
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:25,660
He got progressively louder as the call went on.

3475
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:26,660
Very nice job.

3476
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:27,660
Appreciate that.

3477
02:14:27,660 --> 02:14:29,300
He started to turn the volume up or something.

3478
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:30,700
Loki, your call.

3479
02:14:30,700 --> 02:14:32,660
Hello, this is Orange Launch Radio.

3480
02:14:32,660 --> 02:14:33,660
Who is this?

3481
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:34,660
Hey, it's S.S.

3482
02:14:34,660 --> 02:14:35,660
D.H.

3483
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:36,660
Martin.

3484
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:37,660
Hey, how's it going?

3485
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:49,140
I just want to wish you guys a happy fifth birthday, I guess.

3486
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:54,300
And I also want to thank Rob for coming out to New York and having a great time with us.

3487
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:55,680
I had an awesome time.

3488
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:59,060
It was so much better this year than last year and no offense against last year.

3489
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:03,180
We did our thing and had fun, but that was more of a me thing because I had more time

3490
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:05,500
this year to actually go around and do stuff.

3491
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:08,180
And the stuff we did this year was going to Dave and Buster's and going to that video

3492
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:09,180
game shop.

3493
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,180
It was good.

3494
02:15:10,180 --> 02:15:11,180
It was just like we were buds hanging out.

3495
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:12,180
It was a good time.

3496
02:15:12,180 --> 02:15:13,180
I had a really good time.

3497
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:14,180
Yeah.

3498
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:15,180
It was great.

3499
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:16,180
And you know, that's how gamers should be.

3500
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:21,580
And this is, and you know, or we're just one big family and that's how we should always

3501
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:22,580
be.

3502
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:23,580
Awesome.

3503
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:27,500
Well, hey, since you're in New York or at least the New York area, if a gamer is thinking

3504
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:31,500
of visiting the area because New York is a huge tourist spot, where are some places they

3505
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:37,060
must go in New York?

3506
02:15:37,060 --> 02:15:43,860
I just moved back here, but you know, big New York places, I would say go to the forums

3507
02:15:43,860 --> 02:15:47,980
because the locals really know where the good places are.

3508
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:53,340
You know, there's a lot of bad places, you know, there are basically cracks in the wall.

3509
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:58,000
You can't, you would never be able to find an event if you tried, but I would just like

3510
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,540
hit the forum, I would just say hit the forums, ask everyone.

3511
02:16:01,540 --> 02:16:06,340
There's plenty of places, you know, in Midtown, but you know, outside in the other boroughs,

3512
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:09,840
like Queens or Brooklyn, you know, there's plenty of great places.

3513
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:11,340
What about Nintendo World Store?

3514
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:13,980
Well, yeah, Nintendo World Store is great.

3515
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:17,860
I mean, I thought you meant like arcades type stuff.

3516
02:16:17,860 --> 02:16:18,860
No, that's true.

3517
02:16:18,860 --> 02:16:19,860
That's true.

3518
02:16:19,860 --> 02:16:22,820
And those are good stuff to point out too because you know, certain people when they

3519
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:27,060
try, you know, they want to find that local fighting game or dance game community or whatever

3520
02:16:27,060 --> 02:16:28,060
it is.

3521
02:16:28,060 --> 02:16:29,300
SJ100, Matt, our time is up.

3522
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:31,780
Any, real, real quickly, any last minute thoughts?

3523
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:34,700
Well, no, I, you know, I've been trying to call in all night.

3524
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:36,180
I wanted to ask this one question.

3525
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:42,220
You know, you guys have been on for five years and what would be the one thing you would

3526
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:48,700
like to accomplish within the next five years?

3527
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:50,580
Big question, so I'm going to let someone else start off.

3528
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:53,980
What would be the one thing you'd like to accomplish in the next five years?

3529
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:54,980
With the show?

3530
02:16:54,980 --> 02:16:59,820
Or with the show or in general or what?

3531
02:16:59,820 --> 02:17:03,740
With the show?

3532
02:17:03,740 --> 02:17:11,500
I would really call this ambitious, but I would really like to not only do this internet

3533
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:13,780
based but do it satellite based as well.

3534
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:14,780
Yeah.

3535
02:17:14,780 --> 02:17:15,780
Loki?

3536
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:22,220
To have my wife approve of the show.

3537
02:17:22,220 --> 02:17:23,220
That's a big one, right?

3538
02:17:23,220 --> 02:17:26,500
That's a very Blocked Eagle right there.

3539
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:30,580
I'm going to be a little bit controversial because I know how Jamie feels about this

3540
02:17:30,580 --> 02:17:32,540
idea but I'm going to say video.

3541
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:38,860
See, that would be cool, you know, and I think you know, Rob, that, you know, I'm kind of

3542
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:39,860
in that business.

3543
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:44,420
You know, if you guys ever need someone to shoot it or direct it, I'm here.

3544
02:17:44,420 --> 02:17:45,700
Help me talk Jamie into it.

3545
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:47,260
That's what you got to help me do.

3546
02:17:47,260 --> 02:17:49,660
All right, we really got to let you go.

3547
02:17:49,660 --> 02:17:51,460
We're over time, but take care, buddy.

3548
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:52,460
Okay.

3549
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:53,460
Take it easy, guys.

3550
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:54,460
Bye bye.

3551
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:56,140
All right, I think it's slowing down.

3552
02:17:56,140 --> 02:17:58,900
I think we've only got a couple calls left, but I really want to give a chance for everybody

3553
02:17:58,900 --> 02:17:59,900
to get through.

3554
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:01,900
Jamie, how about you?

3555
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:02,900
Hello.

3556
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:03,900
Hello.

3557
02:18:03,900 --> 02:18:04,900
Who be?

3558
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:09,900
This is Wonder Dog Harold.

3559
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:10,900
Hi.

3560
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:11,900
Hello.

3561
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:15,900
What do you have to say to us?

3562
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:19,020
What do you have to say for yourself?

3563
02:18:19,020 --> 02:18:21,460
Congratulations on your fifth anniversary.

3564
02:18:21,460 --> 02:18:23,020
Thank you.

3565
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:25,020
Did you get us a present?

3566
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:30,260
No, like the customary gift for the first anniversary is this one.

3567
02:18:30,260 --> 02:18:31,260
Is what?

3568
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:32,260
It's wood.

3569
02:18:32,260 --> 02:18:33,260
It's wood.

3570
02:18:33,260 --> 02:18:34,260
I got wood.

3571
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:35,260
I have no wood.

3572
02:18:35,260 --> 02:18:36,260
There you go.

3573
02:18:36,260 --> 02:18:37,260
No gift needed.

3574
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:44,460
Will you try to get some wood for our fifth anniversary?

3575
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:45,700
Maybe.

3576
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:48,540
All right.

3577
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:52,340
Is there a game out there that gives you wood?

3578
02:18:52,340 --> 02:18:53,820
No.

3579
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:55,940
No?

3580
02:18:55,940 --> 02:19:00,380
That's good because that would be maybe crossing the line.

3581
02:19:00,380 --> 02:19:04,180
Really, there's been no game character ever that might give you a little wood?

3582
02:19:04,180 --> 02:19:05,180
No.

3583
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:06,180
All right.

3584
02:19:06,180 --> 02:19:10,760
Well, has anybody in here ever been a video game character that gave you a little wood

3585
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:13,000
or the lady equivalent?

3586
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:20,500
My first video game crush was Ryu from Street Fighter II.

3587
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,820
Tingle?

3588
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:23,260
Who?

3589
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:24,700
What?

3590
02:19:24,700 --> 02:19:26,580
What caller?

3591
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:27,580
You said what?

3592
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:32,620
No, I tried to like stick in Tingle in there real quick.

3593
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:33,620
Oh, Tingle.

3594
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:34,620
Tingle.

3595
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:35,620
No.

3596
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:36,620
This was when I was in high school.

3597
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:38,180
I got you.

3598
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:40,580
Loki, any character ever given you wood?

3599
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:41,580
No.

3600
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:42,580
No Dead or Alive?

3601
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:43,580
No.

3602
02:19:43,580 --> 02:19:48,140
Somebody in our chat room was trying to start a petition for Dead or Alive Xtreme Volleyball

3603
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:49,140
with men.

3604
02:19:49,140 --> 02:19:52,540
I don't know about that one.

3605
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:54,020
Any last minute thoughts caller?

3606
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:55,020
Nope.

3607
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:56,020
All right.

3608
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:59,020
Well, you're a man of many words, Wonder Dog Harold.

3609
02:19:59,020 --> 02:20:00,020
As usual.

3610
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:01,020
Thanks so much for the call.

3611
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:02,020
Take care, buddy.

3612
02:20:02,020 --> 02:20:03,020
Bye-bye.

3613
02:20:03,020 --> 02:20:04,020
Bye.

3614
02:20:04,020 --> 02:20:08,540
Remember when he called in the match game a few weeks ago and was giving all one word

3615
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:09,540
answers?

3616
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:11,820
I think the phone lines may have stopped.

3617
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:13,180
There's no calls coming in right now.

3618
02:20:13,180 --> 02:20:16,420
Let me give it just a few more minutes to make sure and then we're going to call up.

3619
02:20:16,420 --> 02:20:17,420
There it is.

3620
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:18,420
Here's one more.

3621
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:19,420
This is going to be the last.

3622
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:20,420
You had to encourage them, Rob.

3623
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:21,420
This is the last call.

3624
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:22,420
Last call.

3625
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:23,420
Sorry, guys.

3626
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:26,060
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio and this is the last call of the night.

3627
02:20:26,060 --> 02:20:27,060
Who's this?

3628
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:28,060
Oh, my God.

3629
02:20:28,060 --> 02:20:29,060
Who is this?

3630
02:20:29,060 --> 02:20:30,060
This is CT.

3631
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:31,060
Hey.

3632
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:36,140
Hey, you were there from the first episode, dude.

3633
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:37,140
What a good...

3634
02:20:37,140 --> 02:20:38,140
Absolutely.

3635
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:40,860
What a good call to end on tonight because you were one of the...

3636
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:41,860
Oh, my God.

3637
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:44,940
You were one of the 15 people there for episode one.

3638
02:20:44,940 --> 02:20:45,940
Yeah.

3639
02:20:45,940 --> 02:20:49,300
Here's an amazing call to kind of bookend the shows tonight with.

3640
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:52,660
Shit, I don't even know what to ask you, Dark Tetsuya.

3641
02:20:52,660 --> 02:20:54,500
Do you have anything for us tonight?

3642
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:58,620
Well, oh, God.

3643
02:20:58,620 --> 02:21:00,980
I didn't even know where to begin.

3644
02:21:00,980 --> 02:21:03,460
I mean, I'm sorry.

3645
02:21:03,460 --> 02:21:04,460
I'm speechless.

3646
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:15,020
I'm the biggest fangirl of the show that's interested in me and, well, you know, oh,

3647
02:21:15,020 --> 02:21:16,020
my God.

3648
02:21:16,020 --> 02:21:17,020
I forgot.

3649
02:21:17,020 --> 02:21:24,300
This show has helped facilitate a few OL relationships, which has been very interesting how that community,

3650
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:27,980
just communities in general, can have that effect.

3651
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:30,820
I've met a few people I've dated through live journals in that community.

3652
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:36,340
I can't say I've ever met anyone in a gaming-related community, but it's just interesting the way

3653
02:21:36,340 --> 02:21:37,340
that works.

3654
02:21:37,340 --> 02:21:41,020
But, DT, you've been here for the whole thing.

3655
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:43,620
What would you say was the highlight of the past five years?

3656
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:44,620
Oh, my God.

3657
02:21:44,620 --> 02:21:45,620
I don't know.

3658
02:21:45,620 --> 02:21:53,860
Aside from that thing on 230, I'd probably have to go with Loki singing.

3659
02:21:53,860 --> 02:21:58,360
Isn't it amazing that after all these years, they still say that's their favorite moment?

3660
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:59,360
That was awful.

3661
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:01,620
I'm never doing it again.

3662
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:04,260
So like it.

3663
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:05,980
Live it up while it lasts.

3664
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:17,220
I'm calling in, I want the host to know, I was like very shocked, because I asked out.

3665
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:18,220
Whatever.

3666
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:21,460
Oh, Dark Tetsuya, thank you for making it all worth it.

3667
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:22,460
That was wonderful.

3668
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:27,060
I do have a quick few, though.

3669
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:28,060
All right.

3670
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:32,420
I don't know, DT, because that's like the perfect note to end on, but if you must, go

3671
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:33,420
for it.

3672
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:34,420
F you.

3673
02:22:34,420 --> 02:22:38,100
F you to Burger King, because Missy has to work tonight.

3674
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:40,460
F you to work in general.

3675
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:43,300
Let's quit our jobs and move into the Fort.

3676
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:45,100
Yeah.

3677
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:47,580
The O-L-R Fort.

3678
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:49,820
Dark Tetsuya, thank you so much for the call.

3679
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:50,820
We appreciate it.

3680
02:22:50,820 --> 02:22:52,420
And you fucking won, by the way.

3681
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:54,580
Out of all the callers tonight, you won.

3682
02:22:54,580 --> 02:22:55,580
Congratulations.

3683
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:56,580
Thank you.

3684
02:22:56,580 --> 02:22:57,580
Take care.

3685
02:22:57,580 --> 02:22:58,580
Bye.

3686
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:03,580
I'm calling in.

3687
02:23:03,580 --> 02:23:10,020
I now demand that all future call-ins begin with that.

3688
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:16,060
Well guys, the calls have finally slowed down, but if we didn't get to you, we're so sorry

3689
02:23:16,060 --> 02:23:22,220
that we didn't make your phone call, but obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, and even to the podcast

3690
02:23:22,220 --> 02:23:25,460
listeners and those that weren't able to tune in live tonight and listen to us and be a

3691
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:26,860
part of the show.

3692
02:23:26,860 --> 02:23:30,460
We just really want to thank you guys once again for your support over the past five

3693
02:23:30,460 --> 02:23:35,940
years and for tuning in and just inviting us onto your iPods or onto your speakers or

3694
02:23:35,940 --> 02:23:40,100
what have you, and for the enthusiasm that so many of you guys have for the show.

3695
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:42,040
You guys have made it all worth it.

3696
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:47,220
Anything that you guys want to share, Dark Sakura?

3697
02:23:47,220 --> 02:23:50,900
I would like to share with people's bank accounts so that they give me money.

3698
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:53,460
No, really.

3699
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:54,500
I just like doing this.

3700
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:57,260
I'm going to keep doing it, so fuck everything.

3701
02:23:57,260 --> 02:23:58,900
I'm just going to do the show.

3702
02:23:58,900 --> 02:23:59,900
I'll try.

3703
02:23:59,900 --> 02:24:05,900
Thank you guys, and thank you for the five people who've sent me a dollar, by the way.

3704
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:08,180
There's not going to be a pump up the volume, though, on Tuesday.

3705
02:24:08,180 --> 02:24:14,900
This is very important because Live 365 is doing a day of broadcasting silence to protest

3706
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:18,580
whoever those fuckheads are that are doing all this bullshit to internet radio.

3707
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:19,580
The government.

3708
02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:20,580
Yeah.

3709
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:21,580
Like I said, fuckheads.

3710
02:24:21,580 --> 02:24:26,300
No pump up the volume on Tuesday, no nothing on Tuesday.

3711
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:31,540
However, you best hold onto your pants on Wednesday because Rob's going to be on, right?

3712
02:24:31,540 --> 02:24:32,540
That's right.

3713
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:35,900
The door is always open for you, Dark Sakura, if you want to come in and get a little revenge

3714
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:37,900
on Wednesday since you can have a Tuesday show.

3715
02:24:37,900 --> 02:24:39,100
I don't know what you've got going on.

3716
02:24:39,100 --> 02:24:40,100
We'll see.

3717
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:41,100
Oh, wait.

3718
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:42,100
No, there is no show Wednesday.

3719
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:43,100
I'm in Malibu Wednesday.

3720
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:44,100
I can't go.

3721
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:45,100
Bitch.

3722
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,100
So maybe you could do your show Wednesday.

3723
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:47,100
I don't know.

3724
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:48,100
Hit me.

3725
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:49,100
We'll talk.

3726
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:50,100
And then drop me off in L.A. so I can go to some land.

3727
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:51,100
We'll talk offline.

3728
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:52,100
Yeah.

3729
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:53,100
Yeah.

3730
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:54,100
Jamie reminded me.

3731
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:57,580
There are some thank yous that are badly, badly needed because there's like specific

3732
02:24:57,580 --> 02:25:01,260
individuals we have to thank because they've really made the five years with it.

3733
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,860
And please, you know, God, it's just like an Oscar speech.

3734
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:04,860
We're afraid we're going to forget somebody.

3735
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:08,380
But if you guys think, think of anybody I'm forgetting, please let me know.

3736
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:15,140
I want to first, foremost, most importantly, absolutely thank VX Jason XV who has been our

3737
02:25:15,140 --> 02:25:19,300
web host almost at least for like the past two and a half years we've been doing this

3738
02:25:19,300 --> 02:25:20,300
almost since the beginning.

3739
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:23,100
It is an absolutely thankless job.

3740
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:24,980
He asked for nothing for it.

3741
02:25:24,980 --> 02:25:32,660
He built us a podcast feed from scratch and the man just, he just does this because he

3742
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:36,660
wants to and he loves what we're doing and without him we would not be able to accomplish

3743
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:37,900
half of what we have.

3744
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:40,540
So VX Jason XV, you are the man.

3745
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:42,300
Thank you so much for all of your help.

3746
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:45,420
He's like, he's, you know, even though we joke that the chat room is the invisible fourth

3747
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:49,840
host of Orange Laundredo, Jason is like this invisible thing that you don't always see

3748
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:51,620
on the air that's really holding the show up.

3749
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:54,500
So thank you so much to Jason first and foremost.

3750
02:25:54,500 --> 02:26:02,040
I also want to say a big thank you to Travis Donovan of Travis Donovan Live because he

3751
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:06,940
kind of got me into the whole internet broadcasting thing and Jamie to some extent because obviously

3752
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:09,820
Under Station Live was the show we were doing before Orange Laundredo.

3753
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:11,340
I was the number one guest.

3754
02:26:11,340 --> 02:26:16,020
And I see, I don't think Travis really approved of this side project in the beginning because

3755
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:20,700
he saw it as maybe taking away from Under Station Live or what have you but, you know,

3756
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:24,800
nevertheless, I learned a lot from my experiences on Under Station Live and just about like,

3757
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:29,060
you know, kind of how an internet radio show should be and Travis never took any shit from

3758
02:26:29,060 --> 02:26:31,020
anyone and I always love that attitude.

3759
02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:35,020
So I want to say a big thank you to Travis for everything.

3760
02:26:35,020 --> 02:26:39,840
I want to say a big thank you as well to Bobby Blackwolf and Scott and Lawrence and everybody

3761
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:45,880
over AllGames.com for enabling our show to a whole new audience because obviously signing

3762
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:49,580
up with AllGames.com was one of the best moves we ever made in trying to grab ourselves some

3763
02:26:49,580 --> 02:26:50,580
rabid fans.

3764
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:54,700
We just love the fact that our fan bases have kind of clicked in that way and while not

3765
02:26:54,700 --> 02:26:59,460
everybody on AllGames may like our show, those that have, we're very lucky to have over

3766
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:04,340
here listening to OLR as well and we want to thank you guys for helping us get on board

3767
02:27:04,340 --> 02:27:07,700
with this indication over there and opening everything up over there.

3768
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:13,580
God, I don't need, God, so many, I mean, obviously each and every person that's ever

3769
02:27:13,580 --> 02:27:17,540
listened to a live show, ever downloaded a podcast, everybody that's authored stories

3770
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:24,740
for the website, Mel B, Dark Tetsuya, Jimmy, DMN, anybody that's been a part of OLR staff,

3771
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:29,820
I want to thank Chris for a lot over the past few years.

3772
02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:32,140
God, who am I forgetting?

3773
02:27:32,140 --> 02:27:33,140
Anybody?

3774
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:34,140
Anything?

3775
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:35,140
Eh.

3776
02:27:35,140 --> 02:27:36,460
And viewers like you.

3777
02:27:36,460 --> 02:27:37,980
I mean, listeners.

3778
02:27:37,980 --> 02:27:38,980
All right.

3779
02:27:38,980 --> 02:27:42,620
And if I left you out, I'm very, very sorry, but it was kind of like a last minute thing

3780
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:43,620
I wanted to bring up.

3781
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:47,780
Loki, do you have anything you want to say?

3782
02:27:47,780 --> 02:27:49,100
Not until the after birth.

3783
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:51,900
Okay, we'll leave it at that.

3784
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:56,420
Loki, by the way, was not an official host of Orange Launch Radio for the first 20 episodes,

3785
02:27:56,420 --> 02:28:00,940
but you know what, he never missed a show and had that dedication and it's very interesting.

3786
02:28:00,940 --> 02:28:06,180
I didn't even freaking know Loki really before this show started, but now it's just,

3787
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,180
you know.

3788
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:09,060
I drove you down to golf land, dude.

3789
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:12,700
Like, but that was like, but it wasn't like we didn't, you know, we didn't really know

3790
02:28:12,700 --> 02:28:16,140
know each other, like at that point, you know, I feel like I didn't really get to know you

3791
02:28:16,140 --> 02:28:17,140
until this show.

3792
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:20,660
Like, I know who you were and obviously you did a lot of nice things.

3793
02:28:20,660 --> 02:28:23,900
That's what I want to say about Loki is that I know a lot of you think he's a total dick

3794
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:27,120
based on the things that he says about Max and stuff, but he's actually one of the nicest

3795
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:32,180
guys you'll ever meet offline and I'm sorry for ruining your internet persona and whatever,

3796
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:33,180
he really is.

3797
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:34,420
I don't have a persona.

3798
02:28:34,420 --> 02:28:39,300
And Jamie too, because I know, um, you know, she has sometimes the internet persona of

3799
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:45,500
being the queen bee on orange, but she's really got a softy heart too.

3800
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:47,020
You just don't always see it on the show.

3801
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:48,020
You do.

3802
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:49,020
It's, it's made of sponge.

3803
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:50,420
No, it's not.

3804
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:52,300
So it's, it's, it's plasmoid.

3805
02:28:52,300 --> 02:28:56,740
It's, it's a plasma, which means the electrons are charged and it's fiery.

3806
02:28:56,740 --> 02:29:05,660
I have a fiery heart.

3807
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:09,540
Not everybody got to get through on the Skype line tonight, but this was the interesting

3808
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:14,860
thing is that I logged into Skype today and there were voicemails waiting for us, congratulating

3809
02:29:14,860 --> 02:29:17,860
us on the fifth anniversary from people who wouldn't necessarily be able to be here on

3810
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:19,180
the show tonight.

3811
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:22,500
And so I hopped into chat and I said, well, it looks like we have some voicemails.

3812
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:23,640
Anyone want to add some?

3813
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:25,060
And we had some folks call in.

3814
02:29:25,060 --> 02:29:29,420
And so we're going to end it on this sound clip and then we're going to kind of wrap

3815
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:30,420
it up and be out of here.

3816
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:31,420
Oh wait, I'm sorry.

3817
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:33,620
Do you want to do some last minute game stories before we get to that?

3818
02:29:33,620 --> 02:29:34,620
No.

3819
02:29:34,620 --> 02:29:35,620
Oh, oh, oh.

3820
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:36,620
Yeah.

3821
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:37,620
Real quick, just real quick.

3822
02:29:37,620 --> 02:29:47,020
There's a brand new hack in the PSP world that allows homebrew on any firmware so far

3823
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:49,020
all the way up to 3.5.

3824
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:54,300
And funny enough, it does not use Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, but it uses Luminous

3825
02:29:54,300 --> 02:30:00,340
and it's a luminati work around or whatever, exploit I guess they're calling it.

3826
02:30:00,340 --> 02:30:07,340
But very interesting to see that after all this time, Luminous can now allow you to run

3827
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:08,340
homebrew.

3828
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:09,340
Hmm.

3829
02:30:09,340 --> 02:30:10,600
It was there the whole time.

3830
02:30:10,600 --> 02:30:12,580
It's almost like a mystery novel.

3831
02:30:12,580 --> 02:30:13,580
Yeah.

3832
02:30:13,580 --> 02:30:17,260
Ah, Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail.

3833
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:18,260
Is that it?

3834
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:20,660
That's, yeah, that's pretty much it.

3835
02:30:20,660 --> 02:30:22,540
All right, until the after birth.

3836
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:24,540
Let's get to the voicemails, folks.

3837
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:37,540
Hello, I'm Lawrence Londreo, fifth anniversary show.

3838
02:30:37,540 --> 02:30:43,620
I am Insanus, the guy who does the show on Thursday.

3839
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:49,260
I want to call you guys, wish you all a happy, happy, happy fifth anniversary from everybody

3840
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:53,540
here at the Insanus Tower, which right now is me and four listeners.

3841
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:56,700
So yeah.

3842
02:30:56,700 --> 02:31:01,860
But on behalf of everybody in the chat room right now, everyone is wanting to call you

3843
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:09,380
guys and wish you a happy O of R fifth anniversary, Rob, Jamie, Matt, thanks for letting me have

3844
02:31:09,380 --> 02:31:18,140
an evening on the station where I can say as many curse words as I like and enjoy myself.

3845
02:31:18,140 --> 02:31:19,740
You guys are the reason I love doing this.

3846
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:24,020
I got started because you guys, you probably have heard this shit some of the times before,

3847
02:31:24,020 --> 02:31:25,020
but it's true.

3848
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:26,020
You guys are awesome.

3849
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:34,860
Hopefully soon here, I'll be in Sacramento and we will all have a good, good time, but

3850
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:37,180
let's just hope Rob keeps his pants on.

3851
02:31:37,180 --> 02:31:43,660
Jamie doesn't beat me with a Barrett and Matt doesn't throw an iPhone in my hand.

3852
02:31:43,660 --> 02:31:52,180
Anyways, guys, this is a long voice mail and I think I should stop talking like this because

3853
02:31:52,180 --> 02:31:54,620
I think I'm pissing you all off.

3854
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:58,980
Also, Rob, your mom called and she still disappointed in you.

3855
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:02,340
And my mom called and she still disappointed in you.

3856
02:32:02,340 --> 02:32:03,340
Okay.

3857
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:04,340
I'm done.

3858
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:05,340
Bye.

3859
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:16,220
I don't remember what my screen name is on L.O.L.R., hi Rob, hi Jamie, I'm Rob, well I

3860
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:24,380

3866
02:33:01,380 --> 02:33:07,140
I had to call in tonight, it'd be into the fifth year in a version and all, get to work

3868
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:21,700
three years and three months already, oh, that was on Wednesday too, wasn't it vanilla

3869
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:29,140
sky that was the one she showed in, anyway, congrats on five years, yeah, I'll be thinking

3870
02:33:29,140 --> 02:33:34,980
about you when the minute works, bye, it's never long, why do you want to take my baby,

3871
02:33:34,980 --> 02:33:40,660
oh, I can't take my baby, happy this, hey, what's up, this is Tigerclaw, I would like

3872
02:33:40,660 --> 02:33:45,940
to wish Orange Launch Radio a happy five-year anniversary, I've been a long time listener

3873
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:51,780
of the show since I first heard on AllGames.com and here hoping for five more years, take

3874
02:33:51,780 --> 02:34:01,700
care, hey, this is, uh, Mr. Gohan, congratulations on five years of podcasting, I guess, I have

3875
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:08,100
a question about, um, I saw Sky on Xbox Live with the HD DVD player, I was wondering if

3876
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:12,340
it's worth the buy because my brother kind of wants it and he's wondering if you should

3877
02:34:12,340 --> 02:34:20,180
get a PS3 instead just for Blu-ray and yeah, you guys have been doing an awesome job podcasting,

3878
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:25,940
I've been listening for about two years now and you guys are just awesome, keep doing

3879
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:35,220
what you're doing, bye, you gotta love that even on the last congratulatory message there's

3880
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:41,540
a question there about the Blu-ray players, the HD DVD player, if you're buying, um, uh,

3881
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:48,740
something just to watch movies, um, really either one, I mean, they say Blu-ray is winning

3882
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:52,260
but I don't know if that's just marketing smoke and mirrors, I think it's too early

3883
02:34:52,260 --> 02:34:55,380
to tell, honestly, your safest bet is to not take the plunge yet, well, the reason why

3884
02:34:55,380 --> 02:34:59,620
they're saying it's winning is because there's more Blu-ray players out there because each

3885
02:34:59,620 --> 02:35:03,860
one of the PlayStation 3s is a Blu-ray player, so they're counting those in the numbers whether

3886
02:35:03,860 --> 02:35:09,220
people use them as a Blu-ray player or not, all right, so there's your answer, short and

3887
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:14,580
sweet, all right, we're almost to the end, let's go around and get everybody's final

3888
02:35:14,580 --> 02:35:19,620
thought, Loki, I'm out of root beer, Dark Sakura,

3889
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:34,020
uh, my final thought is, um, thank you, to those that care, thank you, you keep it going,

3890
02:35:34,020 --> 02:35:40,180
you keep it awesome, and we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 237,

3891
02:35:40,180 --> 02:35:46,980
5th, 5th, it's 5 years and 1 week anniversary next week, we'll do it all again, see ya.
