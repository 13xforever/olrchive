00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,082

2
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:24,919
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this part B of episode number 236.

3
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:28,920
[SPEAKER_16]: And this, of course, is our fifth year anniversary show.

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,420
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:41,562
[SPEAKER_16]: On June 23rd, 2002, we went live for the very first time with Orange Lounge Radio live episode number one, where some of the topics included... God, what were we talking about that week?

6
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:42,122
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't even remember.

7
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:43,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was kind of more like an intro to the show.

8
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,883
[SPEAKER_16]: We were talking about our experiences playing various...

9
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:47,383
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

10
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:17,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:41,221
[SPEAKER_23]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

12
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,001
[SPEAKER_23]: Join us every Sunday night from 7 o'clock until 9 o'clock.

13
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:24,387
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, God.

14
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:28,713
[SPEAKER_34]: I've never... No, you know, in fact, today I have a modification to that.

15
00:02:29,494 --> 00:02:33,720
[SPEAKER_34]: If you won't take care of your child, I will have someone kill you.

16
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,964
[SPEAKER_34]: Because I'm not going to take care of your child.

17
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:38,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, I don't know about that.

18
00:02:39,557 --> 00:02:40,978
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll have you shot in the head.

19
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,719
[SPEAKER_34]: Headshot for the win.

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Press A. Some users in chat are commenting on the quality of that clip.

21
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:48,124
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

22
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:51,386
[SPEAKER_16]: When Orange Launch Radio started, we were on a dial-up friendly stream.

23
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:55,249
[SPEAKER_16]: So the stream you could hear was usable on 56k modems.

24
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Because five years ago, a lot of people still were on those.

25
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:01,694
[SPEAKER_34]: By the way, do you still own the drive that you have that saved on?

26
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,770
[SPEAKER_34]: if you can find it, I may have a way to extract it

27
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:21,618
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28
00:03:50,544 --> 00:04:14,982
[SPEAKER_16]: and apparently it's come down the wire that the doctors from the AMA have backed away from their decision they're now recommending that the American Psychiatric Association who kind of would be the final judge and jury in this anyway do a little more research quote there is nothing here to suggest that this is a complex psychological disease state akin to alcoholism or other substance abuse disorders and it doesn't get to have the word addiction attached to it

29
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:16,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's addiction.

30
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,583
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's OCD.

31
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:17,944
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

32
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:43,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, anyhow, as we promised here in Part B, we have a pizza on the way.

33
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:46,516
[SPEAKER_34]: We're just going to... Our bread and cheese to go with our wine.

34
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:55,240
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to just kind of kick back and relax, because as we've said a lot this evening, Orange Launch Radio is about you guys, and we get asked all the time.

35
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

36
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:44,590
[SPEAKER_16]: but funny enough we started while they were on hiatus because of G4 and everything and Scott working at G4 and now it's kind of funny that we work together but regardless of all that I just say that because I know we've gained a lot of listeners thanks to our partnership with All Games but just there wasn't a lot like us when we started at least that we knew about so it's kind of interesting because now that podcasting is so huge and essentially any idiot with a microphone can have a podcast which really any idiot with a microphone before could do an internet radio show it's just you know

37
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:45,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

38
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:01,157
[SPEAKER_16]: We have true live interaction.

39
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:07,438
[SPEAKER_16]: We like to pretend we're sitting around at a big table with our listeners and just talking about the latest in gaming.

40
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:15,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes we break stories, although we probably won't be breaking them too much more in the future, but we're not usually thought of as a source for breaking news.

41
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:19,001
[SPEAKER_16]: There's plenty of other game blogs who are paid to bring you breaking news.

42
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,962
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't get paid for this.

43
00:06:20,342 --> 00:06:25,503
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's kind of what distinguishes us from everybody else is the listeners, the chatters, the live interaction that we have.

44
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:27,785
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

45
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

46
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:14,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi guys, this is FootyMonster from Argentina.

47
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I got the first call.

48
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,615
[SPEAKER_16]: You did, you got the first call, FootyMonster.

49
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:19,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Good for you.

50
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:19,755
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

51
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:23,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, guys, I just wanted to say happy fifth birthday.

52
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:29,337
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been with me at least for the last two years when I've actually found you guys right before you went into iTunes.

53
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:32,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a great two years, dude.

54
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:34,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's amazing.

55
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been there every Sunday, give or take.

56
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:41,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty cool to have that kind of your voice go with you all the time.

57
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,090
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

58
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:14,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we don't always get to see that here.

59
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:16,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I called before about it once.

60
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:17,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

61
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:17,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

62
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:19,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, there's no official gaming market here.

63
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:22,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything is a great market.

64
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a 360 costs $700 and a PS3 costs $1,400.

65
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you get a lot of gaming fans down there?

66
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,011
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot.

67
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:34,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, here there's still an arcade scene, so to speak.

68
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:41,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will see a lot of pumped-up DDR, maybe some guitar freaks, maybe, just maybe, because there's like a few machines.

69
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:48,339
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, you know, the King of Firescrout is still there, they go to the arcades, because those things are still affordable, so to speak.

70
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I get that, that's cool.

71
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:56,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I mean, here, the PS2 is still, like, full-blown, like, there's no next-gen here yet.

72
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because you can seriously go buy a backup of a PS2 game for five bucks.

73
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:03,963
[SPEAKER_16]: You got any questions for us tonight or anything you wanted to say?

74
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:06,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if you don't have anything for us, we'll grill you.

75
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, I actually have one question.

76
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:20,534
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you have to say to, I mean, as you know, after iTunes and after all these gaming podcasts came out, many of us, of the listeners, actually started our own ventures into the thing.

77
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:24,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself, I don't know if you guys remember, I have my own show, The Ultimate Quest.

78
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an RPG exclusive show.

79
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We just started that like a few months ago.

80
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:28,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Good plug, good plug.

81
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:28,399
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.

82
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I tried to mention it there.

83
00:09:33,665 --> 00:09:35,906
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do you say to us that actually are starting out?

84
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,427
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you tell us?

85
00:09:38,007 --> 00:09:47,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a good advice or something that helps us keep at it when you're like life sucks and you don't want to edit the show that day and you just want to not do that thing that week.

86
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:50,593
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your advice to all of us who are starting out?

87
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:54,895
[SPEAKER_34]: I say the sooner you get it done, the sooner you don't have to do it again.

88
00:09:57,516 --> 00:09:59,277
[SPEAKER_34]: Get it out of the way out of spite.

89
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:05,303
[SPEAKER_34]: I told you, everything I do practically is motivated by spite.

90
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:06,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And porn.

91
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:08,644
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, not so much the porn.

92
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:11,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Life is things to go.

93
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:14,666
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why my show kind of stopped twice.

94
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's my advice, Footy Monster.

95
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:20,508
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're doing the show, and I'm just saying this in general.

96
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:24,430
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying this at you, but in general to anybody who's thinking about starting a podcast or doing this.

97
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,971
[SPEAKER_16]: If you are doing this program or if you're doing a program

98
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:38,498
[SPEAKER_16]: to try and get more listeners than anyone else or try to get a listener count that's through the roof or to try and get a listener base that's the biggest one you've ever seen.

99
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,023
[SPEAKER_16]: You're doing this for the wrong reasons.

100
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,811
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't even start if that was the reason.

101
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:44,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Goodbye.

102
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no listeners.

103
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:50,312
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to know, though, there are people out there that that is their sole motivation is attention.

104
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:50,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And don't get me wrong.

105
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Attention is lovely.

106
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:56,274
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the attention whore side of me is what keeps me motivated for the past five years.

107
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:57,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Attention can be bad sometimes.

108
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:00,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Attention can be bad, as we learned a couple months ago.

109
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:08,977
[SPEAKER_16]: But regardless, you've got to do this because, especially in these panel-based shows, you've got to really like the people that you're hanging out with.

110
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,138
[SPEAKER_16]: You've really got to love the topic that you're talking about.

111
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:15,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Or be able to fake it.

112
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:20,521
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sure there's been those weeks where I've wanted to come in here and choke a bitch, namely Jamie.

113
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:20,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

114
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,384
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm nice, Ron!

115
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:43,485
[SPEAKER_16]: No, for real.

116
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:53,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not saying that, you know, that's very rare that that kind of thing ever happens where like, you know, I'm like, oh, I'm mad at somebody tonight or I'm mad at the world and I'm going to take it out on Jamie tonight or Loki or whatever.

117
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:54,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, baby.

118
00:11:55,853 --> 00:12:01,776
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's like an opportunity for us to get together and just kind of like, this is kind of how I hang out with Jamie.

119
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:04,798
[SPEAKER_16]: And these days, I used to live with Matt, but now this is how I hang out with him.

120
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,059
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's kind of through this show.

121
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,720
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, you never call, you never write.

122
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,060
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not true.

123
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,640
[SPEAKER_16]: What am I supposed to think?

124
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,461
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not true.

125
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:12,635
[SPEAKER_34]: Rob has left me.

126
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:19,182
[SPEAKER_03]: To us listeners, it seems like you guys are hanging out like 24-7 because the chemistry that you guys have on air is just amazing.

127
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:22,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like brothers and sisters.

128
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:24,767
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to poke them in the eye just because you're annoyed at them.

129
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:27,810
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what it is.

130
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie's my gaming sister.

131
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:29,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Matt's my gaming brother.

132
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:31,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Poking in the eye.

133
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:32,795
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never thought of that.

134
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,236
[SPEAKER_15]: She has glasses, though.

135
00:12:34,276 --> 00:12:34,977
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't do that.

136
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:38,510
[SPEAKER_16]: I have protective eyewear.

137
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,411
[SPEAKER_16]: Roar.

138
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:42,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Footy Monster, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling in.

139
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:43,757
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it, okay?

140
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:48,403
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, you guys keep it up, and happy fifth anniversary, and let's hope there's another five more.

141
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:49,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Appreciate it.

142
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:50,166
[SPEAKER_16]: And hey, quick question for you.

143
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:53,791
[SPEAKER_16]: How long have you and the girl in your icon, who I believe was Canadian, how long have you two been together now?

144
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:58,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been together three years and a half, and I'm actually going to see her in a month.

145
00:12:58,795 --> 00:12:59,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, yay me.

146
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:00,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Congrats, you two.

147
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:04,137
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to point out to Loki and Jamie, look at that cute little icon there.

148
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:04,717
[SPEAKER_16]: They're kissing.

149
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:05,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, get a room.

150
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,479
[SPEAKER_34]: Get a room.

151
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:09,980
[SPEAKER_34]: I can't see through your big fat shoulder.

152
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

153
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,881
[SPEAKER_16]: It keeps clicking away because other calls are dropping in.

154
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:13,861
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, that is cute.

155
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:14,522
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

156
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:15,522
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

157
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:16,042
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, guys.

158
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll let you guys go so you can take more calls.

159
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:18,723
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

160
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:19,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to embarrass you on air, Footy.

161
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:20,484
[SPEAKER_03]: My turn.

162
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:21,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, Footy.

163
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:21,485
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

164
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:22,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

165
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:22,545
[SPEAKER_16]: See you all.

166
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:25,364
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

167
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:53,275
[SPEAKER_21]: Do it for the love.

168
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:55,627
[SPEAKER_16]: I do it for drugs.

169
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:58,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Raven Stolfen

170
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,030
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a bunch of love for this community and video gaming.

171
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,751
[SPEAKER_21]: I really do.

172
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:31,331
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been gaming since I was three.

173
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Three!

174
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:33,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Amen.

175
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,073
[SPEAKER_16]: You got me beat.

176
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I started when I was four or five, I think.

177
00:14:37,314 --> 00:14:37,794
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember.

178
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,554
[SPEAKER_16]: How old were you when you started gaming, DarkSakura?

179
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:41,795
[SPEAKER_34]: Do you really want to know?

180
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:42,235
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

181
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:46,137
[SPEAKER_34]: I think I was three when the Odyssey 2 came out.

182
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:52,204
[SPEAKER_34]: Ozzy 2, I believe, came out in 1979, which I turned 3 in 1970.

183
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,905
[SPEAKER_34]: I know that dates me.

184
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:55,285
[SPEAKER_34]: I turned 3 in 1979.

185
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:00,607
[SPEAKER_34]: So, if that shows, that was my first gaming system.

186
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:01,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what about you?

187
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:03,627
[SPEAKER_15]: I played the ColecoVision.

188
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:06,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I don't remember.

189
00:15:06,568 --> 00:15:08,169
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like round 4.

190
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:11,150
[SPEAKER_34]: My mom was playing Pac-Man when she was pregnant with me.

191
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, so it runs in the family.

192
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,631
[SPEAKER_34]: Or Pong, sorry.

193
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:15,411
[SPEAKER_16]: It runs in the family.

194
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,331
[SPEAKER_34]: And pinball.

195
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:18,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

196
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

197
00:15:19,721 --> 00:15:21,162
[SPEAKER_16]: What was your first game, Raven's Dolphin?

198
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,845
[SPEAKER_21]: Believe it or not, it was Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo.

199
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:26,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, you kids.

200
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:28,626
[SPEAKER_16]: You were three when that came out?

201
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:30,348
[SPEAKER_21]: I was three.

202
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:31,068
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god.

203
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:32,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

204
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,191
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, you just reminded me how old I am.

205
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,271
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no worries, no worries.

206
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:37,272
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all good.

207
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:42,656
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry I missed out to all the 8-bit action, but it's not my fault.

208
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:44,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Smurfs and Bump and Jump.

209
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:48,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, I hella remember Smurfs and the Atari Smurfs.

210
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:49,816
[SPEAKER_34]: Our game was Mousetrap.

211
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:53,198
[SPEAKER_34]: And we had Turbo.

212
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,059
[SPEAKER_34]: But we had a setup for Turbo.

213
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,202
[SPEAKER_34]: We would grab a chair and a TV tray and put the driving wheel on top of it.

214
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:01,564
[SPEAKER_34]: That was where my addiction to peripherals came.

215
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:02,784
[SPEAKER_15]: And Donkey Kong Jr.

216
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:03,605
[SPEAKER_15]: and Kongo Bongo.

217
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the other ones.

218
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:06,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

219
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:07,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Two more things for you, Rob.

220
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:08,868
[SPEAKER_34]: Venture.

221
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:09,369
[SPEAKER_21]: What was that?

222
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Two more things, Rob.

223
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:11,430
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

224
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:15,169
[SPEAKER_21]: What was it you didn't like about the show, out of curiosity?

225
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:30,527
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have puppies.

226
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:31,668
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, my Nintendogs!

227
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:33,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, the five seconds I played that game.

228
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:49,288
[SPEAKER_16]: The Rob D in chat says Nintendog still sells a ton.

229
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:49,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Go figure.

230
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,619
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

231
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:34,564
[SPEAKER_21]: With all the love in my heart, I love you now.

232
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:40,949
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you do these live shows all the time, and I'm starting to do live and failing at it a little bit.

233
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,011
[SPEAKER_16]: But how do you not fail at it like you normally do?

234
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:43,891
[SPEAKER_16]: You keep doing it.

235
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,071
[SPEAKER_17]: We do fail at it, you just don't notice.

236
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,473
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, this is my opinion, and this is from doing my show in this too.

237
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:13,556
[SPEAKER_34]: I think I'm fucking up every episode, okay, but after a while, you know, people are like, oh, that was fun, that was fun.

238
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:14,477
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm like, it was?

239
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:17,738
[SPEAKER_34]: And so you just keep doing it until enough people tell you that it's fine.

240
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:33,656
[SPEAKER_16]: for me and this might be a weird thing to bring up but some people go to church every Sunday night and they make it a habit and they do it every single week and I'm not a religious person and really my religion is not the listeners business anyway but you know this in a way is kind of

241
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:34,457
[SPEAKER_16]: I did.

242
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:35,237
[SPEAKER_16]: I missed episode two.

243
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,581
[SPEAKER_16]: You make a lot of shows.

244
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,602
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'll tell you this.

245
00:18:55,642 --> 00:18:58,564
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been listening since you did the part A, part B thing.

246
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Follow me.

247
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we really appreciate it, Raven Stauffen.

248
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:24,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, oh.

249
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:25,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah?

250
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,444
[SPEAKER_21]: They want me to say this line.

251
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:28,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Should I say it?

252
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:29,225
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, go for it.

253
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

254
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:32,706
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay.

255
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,066
[SPEAKER_16]: It's an inside joke.

256
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:34,906
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thanks, Raven Stauffen.

257
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:35,727
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got to let you go, buddy.

258
00:19:35,747 --> 00:19:35,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

259
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:36,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

260
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:39,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we've got to keep each call to like five minutes.

261
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:39,648
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Loki's turn.

262
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:40,468
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got a lot of calls tonight.

263
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:42,009
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Loki, you get to answer this call.

264
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:42,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

265
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:43,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Who am I going to let you answer?

266
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:43,689
[SPEAKER_16]: How about this one?

267
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:46,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, who is this?

268
00:19:49,718 --> 00:19:50,278
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Airman.

269
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,299
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a crank call.

270
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,360
[SPEAKER_16]: Is somebody there?

271
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:56,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

272
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:58,122
[SPEAKER_16]: Frickin' crank calls.

273
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:00,183
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Loki, you don't get out of it that easy.

274
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:00,883
[SPEAKER_16]: You get another call.

275
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:01,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Here you go, Loki.

276
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:03,525
[SPEAKER_16]: You get this call instead.

277
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:04,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah!

278
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:06,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you get this one.

279
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:08,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I get three calls.

280
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:09,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, this is Orange Lunch Radio.

281
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:10,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is this?

282
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:11,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, what's up, guys?

283
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:13,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Rob D. Hey, how's it going?

284
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:14,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too shabby.

285
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta congratulate you on the 500th episode, obviously.

286
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:18,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

287
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:19,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done.

288
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:23,424
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the most disturbing trends you've seen in gaming, and what is the best trend you've seen in gaming?

289
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:26,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I have an answer for this, but I'll let you guys go first, or if you want to think, I'll...

290
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:51,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Most disturbing trends in gaming?

291
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:52,922
[SPEAKER_34]: The baby stage of Parappa?

292
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:56,102
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I haven't played that, so I don't know.

293
00:20:56,862 --> 00:21:09,125
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I would say probably the most disturbing trend in game is this, like, I don't know, focus on, I guess, a lot of the games seem to be repeating themselves.

294
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:09,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Sequels.

295
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:16,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Too many sequels, or even better, too many fucking spin-off games, like Square, let's see.

296
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:21,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect example, Final Fantasy VII should only be one game.

297
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,771
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Final Fantasy VII.

298
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:27,232
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need Final Fantasy VII, A, B, C, D, E, so on.

299
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:28,392
[SPEAKER_15]: That's annoying.

300
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:39,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, this whole thing with violent video games and people targeting stuff, I don't think video games are that much more violent than they were years ago.

301
00:21:39,676 --> 00:21:41,076
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the technology has gotten better.

302
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,717
[SPEAKER_34]: The way that they're displayed is more graphic.

303
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:47,484
[SPEAKER_02]: and more mainstream.

304
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:50,566
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got people finally realizing that games aren't just for kids.

305
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,588
[SPEAKER_34]: I attribute it to society getting wimpier.

306
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,492
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that people are getting more coddled.

307
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:07,519
[SPEAKER_34]: For example, when we were kids, who played tetherball and who had metal jungle gyms at school?

308
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we had that.

309
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:09,961
[SPEAKER_34]: Now what are they?

310
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:11,722
[SPEAKER_34]: Plastic and no tetherball.

311
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:12,323
[SPEAKER_34]: What the hell?

312
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

313
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:31,952
[SPEAKER_34]: We were sort of raised in the, oh, well, kids got to take their bumps, right?

314
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:38,778
[SPEAKER_34]: You're not going to learn not to fall off the swing set if you don't fall off the swing set once to find out that the ground is hard, you know?

315
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,443
[SPEAKER_34]: And now parents are like, oh, we need to protect them from all this and blah, blah, blah.

316
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:46,684
[SPEAKER_34]: Let's raise a society of wimpy asses.

317
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:47,885
[SPEAKER_34]: You know what?

318
00:22:48,126 --> 00:22:49,747
[SPEAKER_34]: Part of being a child is learning.

319
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:51,008
[SPEAKER_34]: Is learning.

320
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:51,388
[SPEAKER_34]: That's it.

321
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:52,029
[SPEAKER_34]: Is learning.

322
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,211
[SPEAKER_34]: Part of being, you know...

323
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:55,574
[SPEAKER_34]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

324
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:20,737
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, that was kind of deep.

325
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:25,459
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to say, my most disturbing trend is bad ports.

326
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Ubisoft, Wii, end of case.

327
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,862
[SPEAKER_16]: EA, first generation 360 games.

328
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:35,323
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

329
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:38,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Bad fucking ports is the most disturbing trend in gaming.

330
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Most Wii games?

331
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:42,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Best trend in gaming real quick, then we'll let Rob D. give his answers.

332
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:43,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Best trend in gaming.

333
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:48,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Best trend in gaming, I would say multiplayer and downloadable content.

334
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:51,881
[SPEAKER_34]: I have to say bizarre indie games.

335
00:23:53,987 --> 00:23:55,412
[SPEAKER_34]: With the exception of Irritating Stick.

336
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to give the big three each one, because I do like that the big three each have something going for them.

337
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:05,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Nintendo, innovation and control style.

338
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:08,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Say what you will about the Wii being a one-stop shop.

339
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,263
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really turned a lot of people on to gaming who weren't there before, so yay Nintendo.

340
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:16,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Microsoft, Xbox Live, king of online gaming, undisputed champion.

341
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:20,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Sony, hard to say so far, but home...

342
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:23,634
[SPEAKER_16]: looks very innovative as well and could be very cool.

343
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:30,836
[SPEAKER_16]: So, depending on that, but certainly not the brown-eyed judgment, which also would be my runner-up for worst trend in gaming is cameras.

344
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:35,017
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's a brilliant idea, but nobody's used it well yet.

345
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:35,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody.

346
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:37,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob D., what do you think?

347
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:42,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my best trend in gaming, I'm going to have to agree with Loki and Sky on this one, definitely.

348
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Xbox Live and the rise of online gaming on consoles.

349
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:49,442
[SPEAKER_02]: With the online community I've seen and taken part in and

350
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,439
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Xbox 360.

351
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a wonderful thing.

352
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,540
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no two ways about it.

353
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I swear to God I'll be there for Hold'em eventually.

354
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hold you to that.

355
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:01,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Worst trend in gaming?

356
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:17,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have to go the opposite route of DarkSakura because I really think that a lot of publishers are being pushed in a direction to squash some games that may or may not sell well or that people these analysts may think won't sell well.

357
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:24,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the DS, there are more independent games and there are some companies more willing to take a chance.

358
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:33,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you see these development costs rising and rising so much on these next-gen systems, a lot of games don't necessarily get to be released.

359
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:35,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a shame.

360
00:25:37,276 --> 00:25:37,536
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

361
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, there you have it.

362
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,377
[SPEAKER_16]: So rising development costs.

363
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember when games were made by one dude?

364
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:49,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of those Atari 2600 games were made by one dude.

365
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:52,858
[SPEAKER_16]: And now they're like multi-million dollar productions.

366
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:53,938
[SPEAKER_15]: But they don't have to be.

367
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:57,719
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they don't really have to be to be successful games.

368
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,159
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the thing.

369
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:07,742
[SPEAKER_15]: People, especially publishers and developers, are kind of under this impression that they need to really push the envelope as far as realism in games, and that's not necessarily the case.

370
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:11,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you don't need to be realistic in order to be a good game.

371
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:27,652
[SPEAKER_16]: BlackWolfInChat, excellent point Ultima was made by one dude now the original Ultima is for me not that incredible of a game but the trend that it started huge so anyway Remember Adventure on the 2600?

372
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Made by one guy Isn't that phenomenal?

373
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that phenomenal?

374
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:33,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Adventure?

375
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:41,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Think about how many hours you spend on a game like Adventure Just phenomenal RobD we gotta wrap it up and let some more people through but any last thoughts?

376
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

377
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,847
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got for you guys.

378
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:49,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking my call, and I hope you guys go for another, well, five years if you want to, I should say that.

379
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,351
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll try our best.

380
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:52,732
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to, then you've got to stop at that point.

381
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:56,394
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you want to hear more of the Rob D, as you should, he's a great radio host.

382
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,476
[SPEAKER_16]: You really do have a voice for radio, Rob D. It's amazing.

383
00:26:58,796 --> 00:27:00,457
[SPEAKER_16]: tdig.allgames.com.

384
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:01,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Check it out.

385
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:01,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:02,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stay in gaming.

387
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,639
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm done with pimping, enjoy the rest of your show.

388
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,019
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

389
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good one, Rob D. Appreciate it.

390
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:09,228
[SPEAKER_16]: My turn to take a call.

391
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go.

392
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:13,351
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to go to a telephone call and see how that one turns out.

393
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:13,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do this one.

394
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:15,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

395
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:15,833
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

396
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:18,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, this is Scott.

397
00:27:18,535 --> 00:27:19,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this is Yuri Lover.

398
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:21,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Yuri Lover.

399
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:22,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, good.

400
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:22,819
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you?

401
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:24,200
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm good.

402
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, DarkSakura.

403
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:26,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Loki.

404
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:30,284
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to say congrats on a big five.

405
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:31,105
[SPEAKER_18]: All right?

406
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:31,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

407
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,327
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll be starting kindergarten soon.

408
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,393
[SPEAKER_34]: We were in preschool already, and now we're this many.

409
00:27:43,874 --> 00:27:49,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, Olar, did Uncle touch you in the no-no area at all?

410
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:50,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Did they?

411
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:51,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Did he?

412
00:27:51,497 --> 00:27:59,840
[SPEAKER_16]: No, but Loki's been kind of messing with my mind over the past couple years, so I guess there's that.

413
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:04,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Talk about games for Christ's sake.

414
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:05,917
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you want to say about games?

415
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:07,558
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to get to that.

416
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:11,422
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to get to some great gaming affairs.

417
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:16,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Some great gaming affairs that I know of.

418
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:22,874
[SPEAKER_18]: EA and Westwood, Maxis, and every other goddamn company bought out by EA.

419
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,924
[SPEAKER_18]: Me and your mom last night.

420
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:33,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Microsoft and Namco.

421
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,651
[SPEAKER_18]: Apple and Nintendo.

422
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:37,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And OR and GameTap.

423
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:39,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Why you gotta cheat on me?

424
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:40,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

425
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Why you gotta cheat on me with GameTap?

426
00:28:43,635 --> 00:28:46,617
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think has been a great partnership and what do you think has been a bad partnership?

427
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:47,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Does anybody want to try and answer this one?

428
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:48,298
[SPEAKER_16]: EA and anybody?

429
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:49,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Has it been a bad partnership?

430
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:49,559
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

431
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:49,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

432
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,481
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's a bad partnership, yes.

433
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,162
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they just ruined the Command & Conquer series.

434
00:29:19,242 --> 00:29:19,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, why?

435
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:21,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, is it because they ruined Command & Conquer?

436
00:29:21,623 --> 00:29:26,905
[SPEAKER_34]: I think the He Who Shall Not Be Named and Law is a bad combination.

437
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Lord Voldemort and the Study of Law?

438
00:29:28,986 --> 00:29:30,246
[SPEAKER_34]: No, He Who Shall Not Be Named.

439
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:31,067
[SPEAKER_16]: No, not Voldemort!

440
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:31,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Not Voldemort!

441
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:32,387
[SPEAKER_16]: No!

442
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:36,649
[SPEAKER_34]: Just... No, I'm not going to say it on air.

443
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:40,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I would say a bad partnership...

444
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:44,276
[SPEAKER_16]: was Nintendo and Sony.

445
00:29:45,656 --> 00:29:47,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, no, that might have been a good partnership.

446
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:49,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my God, the PlayStation one on the net?

447
00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:51,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the whole PlayStation one.

448
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:52,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, wow.

449
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:59,260
[SPEAKER_16]: If you think about it, though, I mean, maybe not, because maybe that was actually a good partnership, because if that hadn't happened, maybe the PlayStation would have never come out.

450
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:04,650
[SPEAKER_16]: So, and that way, you know, the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 certainly have changed the face of gaming.

451
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,372
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe that was actually a good partnership.

452
00:30:06,412 --> 00:30:08,033
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe that's not fair for me to say.

453
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:08,873
[SPEAKER_16]: How about this?

454
00:30:09,414 --> 00:30:10,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Bad partnership.

455
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:11,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

456
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:13,396
[SPEAKER_16]: What the fuck were you thinking of partnership?

457
00:30:14,137 --> 00:30:15,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Philips, CD-i, and Nintendo.

458
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,200
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

459
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody can agree that was bad.

460
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:24,064
[SPEAKER_34]: Or what was it that, no, it was the CD-i that was playing Sega CD games, wasn't it?

461
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:38,282
[SPEAKER_16]: I can tell you one, I think, if it ever happened.

462
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:41,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Sega and Microsoft with the original Xbox.

463
00:30:42,263 --> 00:30:48,044
[SPEAKER_18]: How there were rumors going around that the Dreamcast was going to be on the Xbox, or the Dreamcast games were going to be playable.

464
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:50,505
[SPEAKER_34]: Some of them made it, well, in different ways.

465
00:30:53,389 --> 00:31:19,508
[SPEAKER_16]: I would have loved to have like guitar here or popping music on my Xbox or something I would say a good partnership has been Square and Enix I think a lot of people had a lot to fear from that merger but you know the momentum hasn't really stopped and there's been a lot of really good games that have come out of those companies Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest VIII you know we still see a lot of good stuff granted Loki's problem with sequels they do have that problem the laser active that's what it was sorry

466
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Bad Partnerships, so far at least.

467
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Konami and Hudson, actually.

468
00:31:26,142 --> 00:31:30,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Because to be honest, Hudson, everything from that division has really sucked lately.

469
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Bomberman, you know, Act Zero.

470
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:37,268
[SPEAKER_34]: That game doesn't exist in my universe.

471
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,729
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I don't know.

472
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:46,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Hudson, I mean, they've got some good things going for them, but I know they love Bomberman.

473
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:47,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, great.

474
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:49,654
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's get past Bomberman.

475
00:31:49,954 --> 00:31:50,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Let that series...

476
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:53,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Take a rest for a few years, you know.

477
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,733
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't need to release a new Bomberman title every fucking year.

478
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the Xbox Live Arcade one looks pretty good.

479
00:31:59,094 --> 00:31:59,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let him have that.

480
00:31:59,675 --> 00:32:01,876
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, hey, how about positivity?

481
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,456
[SPEAKER_34]: What about the good partnerships?

482
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:04,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Square Enix!

483
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:05,357
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, yeah.

484
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:13,481
[SPEAKER_34]: I actually was going to say, this is an old one, but Bleem and Sega.

485
00:32:14,361 --> 00:32:16,722
[SPEAKER_34]: Even though Sega didn't really have any authority over it.

486
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,023
[SPEAKER_34]: Bleemcast.

487
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:20,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Good times.

488
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:22,535
[SPEAKER_16]: You got playing the PlayStation games on the Dreamcast?

489
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:33,402
[SPEAKER_34]: It was only certain ones, but keep in mind, I am the biggest Tekken fangirl ever, and Tekken 3 on Bleemcast was better than the arcade.

490
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:34,182
[SPEAKER_34]: It was beautiful.

491
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:36,324
[SPEAKER_34]: I was like, hell yeah, take me now.

492
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:41,507
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Yuri Lever, what about you?

493
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:42,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything you want to add to this?

494
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:49,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really, but I just want to say congrats again.

495
00:32:50,191 --> 00:32:57,983
[SPEAKER_18]: My parents are sort of getting pissed off right now because I'm talking on the phone to total strangers, is what they think.

496
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:59,345
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't get much stranger than Rob.

497
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:00,184
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

498
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're sorry, Mom, and we're sorry, Dad.

499
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,508
[SPEAKER_16]: And, yeah, so we'll have a good one.

500
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:04,888
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll hang out.

501
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:05,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, don't worry.

502
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:06,189
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my dad's birthday.

503
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,971
[SPEAKER_18]: He'll just get pissed off tomorrow.

504
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:09,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, he's got a good birthday then.

505
00:33:09,172 --> 00:33:09,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy birthday.

506
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:10,393
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

507
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:11,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

508
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:11,534
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

509
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:12,815
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see you later, you're a lover.

510
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:14,536
[SPEAKER_16]: One more thing.

511
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Do your parents know you're a yearly lover?

512
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,981
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't know what it means.

513
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:20,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I get it.

514
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:21,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, never mind then.

515
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:21,803
[SPEAKER_16]: One more thing, yes.

516
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:23,404
[SPEAKER_34]: It just means that you like snow.

517
00:33:23,964 --> 00:33:25,185
[SPEAKER_34]: No, not snow.

518
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:26,987
[SPEAKER_34]: You like lilies.

519
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:28,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Let him have his one more thing, yes.

520
00:33:30,532 --> 00:33:31,432
[SPEAKER_16]: ResTrans Vibrator.

521
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:36,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Best peripheral ever, ResTrans Vibrator.

522
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:38,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it is.

523
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:39,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Until 3Feel comes out, yes.

524
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:39,995
[SPEAKER_16]: All through.

525
00:33:41,055 --> 00:33:41,396
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

526
00:33:42,056 --> 00:33:42,936
[SPEAKER_16]: See you later, Yuri Lever.

527
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:43,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for the call.

528
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:44,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good one.

529
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:50,639
[SPEAKER_34]: Hey, Rob, before we take a call, I have to tell you about something that someone reminded me of in the chat room.

530
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:50,959
[SPEAKER_34]: What's that?

531
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:57,601
[SPEAKER_34]: Dan found a YouTube video of someone using the Mugen emulator to put the R-Type ship into Super Mario Bros.,

532
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,446
[SPEAKER_34]: and played through the first level of Super Mario Bros.

533
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:01,266
[SPEAKER_34]: with the ship from R-Type.

534
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,007
[SPEAKER_34]: That's awesome.

535
00:34:02,347 --> 00:34:03,848
[SPEAKER_34]: Anyway, I'm going to answer this one.

536
00:34:04,048 --> 00:34:04,849
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do some more calls.

537
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:06,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you going to do email bag tonight?

538
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I am, but I need to answer this.

539
00:34:07,872 --> 00:34:08,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do some more calls.

540
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:09,833
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we'll let you take a call here.

541
00:34:10,794 --> 00:34:11,154
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

542
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:14,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

543
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:16,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

544
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,060
[SPEAKER_17]: I fear the Jamie.

545
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,920
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Junami.

546
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:21,803
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

547
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:21,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

548
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:23,904
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

549
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:24,925
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't sound like yourself.

550
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe because you screamed in his ear.

551
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:28,168
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

552
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:30,183
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think that was it.

553
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:32,184
[SPEAKER_34]: What do you want?

554
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:35,846
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just saying hi and happy fucking birthday.

555
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:38,188
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, we're going to Sack Anime, right?

556
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:39,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we are.

557
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:40,329
[SPEAKER_34]: When is that again?

558
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,771
[SPEAKER_17]: That is middle of July.

559
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,792
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it's July 14th and 15th.

560
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:45,892
[SPEAKER_17]: We are so there.

561
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:47,313
[SPEAKER_17]: On SackAnime.com.

562
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:48,494
[SPEAKER_34]: You're going to cosplay with me, right?

563
00:34:49,615 --> 00:34:51,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I might if I can, uh... Nerds!

564
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:53,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking nerds!

565
00:34:53,517 --> 00:34:54,898
[SPEAKER_34]: Rob, you know what?

566
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:55,598
[SPEAKER_34]: Ah!

567
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Did we ever get a panel on that?

568
00:34:58,644 --> 00:34:59,024
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

569
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:00,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Explicit was looking into it for us.

570
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,187
[SPEAKER_16]: To do a panel at SAK Anime.

571
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:04,989
[SPEAKER_34]: So what do you want?

572
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:06,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Somewhere in the basement of the Scottish Rite.

573
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,731
[SPEAKER_34]: You've got to have a topic.

574
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:09,452
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll give you a topic.

575
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:12,214
[SPEAKER_34]: Gothic architecture is neither gothic nor architecture.

576
00:35:12,294 --> 00:35:13,034
[SPEAKER_34]: Discuss.

577
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,077
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have any arches.

578
00:35:16,137 --> 00:35:16,897
[SPEAKER_17]: I have flat feet.

579
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Drew, you've been a long time listener of Orange Lounge Radio.

580
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Best thing that ever happened on this program?

581
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd have to say episode 69.

582
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:31,486
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel bad because Jamie wasn't there for that.

583
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:33,487
[SPEAKER_34]: Is that the weekend I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room?

584
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do you think it was the best moment?

585
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:35,829
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

586
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:36,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you hear what Drew said?

587
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,191
[SPEAKER_16]: He said, why do you think it was the best one?

588
00:35:39,532 --> 00:35:41,013
[SPEAKER_34]: I know where you live.

589
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:42,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, you do.

590
00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:43,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe you could give me a ride home.

591
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:47,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here's the story behind episode 69.

592
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:53,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie was gone for a week and our friend Janae came on the program.

593
00:35:53,462 --> 00:35:56,785
[SPEAKER_16]: And Janae was having fun with it because she thought... The mistress.

594
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:58,466
[SPEAKER_16]: She thought it was a phone sex line.

595
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:02,088
[SPEAKER_16]: So, and the fact that it was episode number 69 didn't help any.

596
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:07,752
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was episode 69, and that's when Karaoke Revolution, the very first one, was brand new.

597
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:12,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And back in the day, we used to fuck off so bad on the program.

598
00:36:12,895 --> 00:36:14,336
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, we didn't have these set topics.

599
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:17,318
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, every program was kind of like tonight, in a way.

600
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:19,299
[SPEAKER_16]: It was the three-hour tour.

601
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

602
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,381
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's so weird how we've become organized since then.

603
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:24,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, we're organized?

604
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:25,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

605
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:25,503
[SPEAKER_16]: and someone.

606
00:36:26,223 --> 00:36:27,144
[SPEAKER_16]: When did this come about?

607
00:36:27,244 --> 00:36:29,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Karaoke Revolution got broken out.

608
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:34,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki gave his most infamous performance that in some ways has scared him off from ever doing karaoke again.

609
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:38,388
[SPEAKER_16]: So I ask Loki, is episode 69 to blame for your fear of karaoke?

610
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:40,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I just hate karaoke and I don't know why I did it.

611
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:42,269
[SPEAKER_16]: You made me do it last time.

612
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:44,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Karaoke hates you.

613
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,791
[SPEAKER_16]: I told him he was kicked out of the apartment if you wouldn't do karaoke or something.

614
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,452
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember what it was.

615
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:51,732
[SPEAKER_16]: I did it twice.

616
00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:53,913
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to pick the song at random.

617
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:55,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

618
00:36:56,274 --> 00:37:00,295
[SPEAKER_16]: And then of course he changed the lyrics to I'm coming out to I'm staying in.

619
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:02,216
[SPEAKER_16]: I like the pussy or something like that.

620
00:37:02,236 --> 00:37:03,436
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so freaking funny.

621
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:05,357
[SPEAKER_16]: We were peeing ourselves laughing.

622
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:08,137
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure there's a bootleg clip floating around somewhere.

623
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:11,678
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I need to send to Scott for the all-game soundboard.

624
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,339
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got the MP3s.

625
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:14,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you?

626
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,440
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm not sharing.

627
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,941
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Drew.

628
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:21,281
[SPEAKER_17]: We had milkshakes.

629
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:27,326
[SPEAKER_17]: and I believe that was the episode that Milkshake won the cage match.

630
00:37:27,727 --> 00:37:29,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I gotta run for just a minute because the food's here.

631
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt, please take over, Jamie.

632
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,229
[SPEAKER_34]: Food!

633
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:33,610
[SPEAKER_34]: I know, God.

634
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,431
[SPEAKER_34]: I could really use some pizza right now.

635
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:37,112
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got pizza.

636
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:39,293
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't get any pizza because I'm on the floor.

637
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:40,594
[SPEAKER_34]: Ha ha!

638
00:37:41,114 --> 00:37:41,975
[SPEAKER_34]: Floor for you.

639
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:43,136
[SPEAKER_34]: No pizza.

640
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:45,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, it was Loki on the floor that time.

641
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:46,738
[SPEAKER_34]: Dude, okay.

642
00:37:47,878 --> 00:37:50,520
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that we should have the official Orange Lounge Radio barbecue.

643
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:54,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, good idea.

644
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:55,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Glad I thought of it.

645
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,561
[SPEAKER_17]: I am not high.

646
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,022
[SPEAKER_34]: No, you're drunk.

647
00:37:59,042 --> 00:37:59,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn, I am not high.

648
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:00,803
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just me.

649
00:38:01,643 --> 00:38:02,164
[SPEAKER_34]: You're drunk.

650
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:04,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, fine, I'm drunk.

651
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:05,226
[SPEAKER_17]: You got me.

652
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:08,568
[SPEAKER_34]: Just because I have corrupted you.

653
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:09,929
[SPEAKER_17]: I have good beer this time.

654
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,209
[SPEAKER_34]: What do you have?

655
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:12,010
[SPEAKER_34]: Tell me what you're drinking.

656
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I have Arrogant Bastard IPA.

657
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:18,954
[SPEAKER_34]: Not bad, however, I can do you better.

658
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:20,275
[SPEAKER_34]: I've got Guinness in the fridge at home.

659
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:23,815
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm never buying cheap champagne again.

660
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,397
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh my god, this stuff went right to my head.

661
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:28,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Should I mail you some waffles?

662
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:31,224
[SPEAKER_34]: No, dammit, I don't need waffles.

663
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Waffles, waffles.

664
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:34,948
[SPEAKER_34]: I paid you back your waffles, didn't I?

665
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, a long time ago.

666
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,071
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, I forgot.

667
00:38:39,132 --> 00:38:40,514
[SPEAKER_34]: Rob needs to bring us our pizza!

668
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:42,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Waffles.

669
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:48,417
[SPEAKER_34]: Dude, I could actually go for waffles instead.

670
00:38:48,817 --> 00:38:50,458
[SPEAKER_34]: I could go for pancakes right now, okay?

671
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,500
[SPEAKER_34]: So, okay, tell us something relevant.

672
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:01,946
[SPEAKER_34]: Like, talk about what do you think in the past five years of our show you think the best game released has been?

673
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:05,068
[SPEAKER_34]: The most innovative game of the year type game.

674
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Katamari Damacy.

675
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:08,851
[SPEAKER_34]: Why do you feel this way?

676
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:09,712
[SPEAKER_17]: No contest.

677
00:39:10,772 --> 00:39:11,173
[SPEAKER_34]: Food!

678
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:13,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, food.

679
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:15,296
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, I'm not talking to you anymore.

680
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:15,816
[SPEAKER_34]: There's food here.

681
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:17,677
[SPEAKER_16]: I see how it is.

682
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:18,818
[SPEAKER_16]: I see where your priorities are.

683
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:32,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Watch it be the wrong pizza.

684
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:33,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, they give you coupons.

685
00:39:33,682 --> 00:39:34,742
[SPEAKER_15]: They never give me coupons.

686
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:34,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

687
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:35,683
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm special.

688
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:38,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Now everyone is on the floor for pizza that reminds me of number 29.

689
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:39,564
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

690
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:42,746
[SPEAKER_17]: Drew, we got to let you go because we have a bunch of other calls coming in.

691
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:43,766
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

692
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:44,206
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

693
00:39:44,346 --> 00:39:44,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

694
00:39:44,806 --> 00:39:45,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no.

695
00:39:45,207 --> 00:39:45,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Vagina puppies.

696
00:39:46,647 --> 00:39:47,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut up.

697
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:47,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

698
00:39:48,048 --> 00:39:48,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Objection.

699
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:51,149
[SPEAKER_16]: What a nerd.

700
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:51,929
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

701
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:52,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's answering this call?

702
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,690
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, it's your turn, right?

703
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:54,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

704
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,131
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

705
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:55,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Then answer this one.

706
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:56,171
[SPEAKER_16]: This one.

707
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:00,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Vacuum Cleaner, how's it going?

708
00:40:00,977 --> 00:40:02,458
[SPEAKER_34]: Holy shit, what's that?

709
00:40:02,478 --> 00:40:06,779
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't want to know.

710
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:07,700
[SPEAKER_15]: That was not good.

711
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to know what they're doing.

712
00:40:10,101 --> 00:40:13,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Whoever just called us, please give us a call back a little later.

713
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:20,385
[SPEAKER_16]: When you've called, Echo123 is what you want to call to always make sure that your internet connection is working.

714
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,026
[SPEAKER_16]: And cleaned up.

715
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,546
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't sound like Vacuum Cleaner.

716
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,367
[SPEAKER_16]: No problem, it happens, dude.

717
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:24,987
[SPEAKER_16]: No problem.

718
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,128
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Loki, how about you try this one instead?

719
00:40:28,249 --> 00:40:28,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

720
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:28,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

721
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:29,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, who is this?

722
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,878
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, this is Insanus reporting live from Duck Island.

723
00:40:35,658 --> 00:40:36,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Duck Island?

724
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:38,840
[SPEAKER_15]: How's it going?

725
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,601
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going well.

726
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:43,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Congratulations on five years, guys.

727
00:40:44,283 --> 00:40:44,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

728
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:47,885
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to celebrate by taking pizza.

729
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:49,646
[SPEAKER_15]: What the crap is Duck Island?

730
00:40:50,727 --> 00:40:51,647
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't remember that?

731
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:52,268
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

732
00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:54,109
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

733
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:54,209
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

734
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember the show where I was absolutely on a drunken rampage in the chat room?

735
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:00,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.

736
00:41:01,165 --> 00:41:02,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, now I remember.

737
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:02,587
[SPEAKER_16]: I do.

738
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:11,334
[SPEAKER_24]: And a certain individual, who will not be named Rob, asked if I've ever been to Duck Island.

739
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:16,939
[SPEAKER_24]: And I responded with, your mom goes to Duck Island.

740
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,361
[SPEAKER_24]: And Rob laughed like a silly little girl.

741
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:20,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know.

742
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:20,823
[SPEAKER_16]: I do that sometimes.

743
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,144
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, what do you want to talk to us about?

744
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:28,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you guys were talking about good ideas like with companies merging or working together.

745
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:35,724
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys missed a really obvious one, Harmonix and Red Octane with the whole Guitar Hero thing.

746
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:40,869
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, honestly, that's probably been one of the biggest game franchises in the past two years.

747
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:41,909
[SPEAKER_16]: You're getting a little quieter.

748
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:43,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Put your mouth closer to the microphone.

749
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,532
[SPEAKER_16]: But yes, dude, you're right.

750
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:49,235
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really been kind of one of the first partnerships to give Konami a run for its money too.

751
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:50,036
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what?

752
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:52,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Competition in some ways is a good thing, honestly.

753
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Is this better?

754
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:56,181
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, much better.

755
00:41:56,741 --> 00:41:57,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

756
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:02,883
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just calling to say congratulations on five years.

757
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:04,123
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's to five more.

758
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,745
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope my show lasts five months.

759
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:14,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, how long has your show been going?

760
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, you're starting this new show, right?

761
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:18,668
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on.

762
00:42:18,728 --> 00:42:20,929
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be episode four this week.

763
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:22,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Good job.

764
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:24,420
[SPEAKER_24]: And what do you talk about on your show?

765
00:42:24,821 --> 00:42:30,964
[SPEAKER_24]: We talk about absolutely nothing, so it's pretty much like your show was back in the day, I would take it.

766
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:31,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Good times.

767
00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:32,986
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad somebody's picking up the slack.

768
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:38,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I have to because, you know, I'm the big retarded kid of Orange Lounge Radio.

769
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:40,910
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

770
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:43,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

771
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:46,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Not anything that would get me fired.

772
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:49,295
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

773
00:42:49,496 --> 00:42:49,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Good times.

774
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:51,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, I love you guys.

775
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:53,543
[SPEAKER_16]: I love you too, DMN.

776
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:54,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't get too drunk.

777
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:55,464
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll try.

778
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:56,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, later.

779
00:42:56,964 --> 00:42:57,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, have a good one, DMN.

780
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:03,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of, DMN brings up a good point I want to ask you guys about really quick.

781
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,768
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think have been some of the best guests we've ever had on Orange Lounge Radio?

782
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, DMN was here once.

783
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:11,470
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had a lot of people in and out of this house.

784
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,831
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you guys think were some of the best guests we've ever had on the program?

785
00:43:16,312 --> 00:43:16,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Abe Lincoln.

786
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:19,613
[SPEAKER_34]: Me.

787
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:19,673
[SPEAKER_34]: Me.

788
00:43:20,461 --> 00:43:21,162
[SPEAKER_34]: and my ego.

789
00:43:22,863 --> 00:43:25,145
[SPEAKER_34]: My favorite guest ever has been Sauce.

790
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:27,327
[SPEAKER_34]: And the lesbians.

791
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:30,069
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the lesbians have been some of the best guests we've ever had.

792
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:31,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Sauce is the best guest.

793
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,452
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a lot of good women that come on the show.

794
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:34,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing against the men.

795
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:39,897
[SPEAKER_34]: I'd have to say the top three have been Tiara and Kristen and Megzi.

796
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome times.

797
00:43:41,974 --> 00:43:42,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, this is Scott.

798
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:43,075
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you guys doing?

799
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:44,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations on five years.

800
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,196
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Scott from All Games?

801
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:11,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I've been listening to the show, and I've been hearing a lot of people who seem to just be calling in to wishing you congratulations just to plug their podcast.

802
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:13,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to mention where I'm from.

803
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make this about you.

804
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Every call, it's like, hey, I do a podcast.

805
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:21,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I want to give a shout-out on my podcast.

806
00:44:21,271 --> 00:44:21,612
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

807
00:44:21,632 --> 00:44:27,453
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about you three and this show, and it doesn't matter what I do or where I come from, okay?

808
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:30,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that, but isn't it funny?

809
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:32,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, there's the best guest on our show right there.

810
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:42,452
[SPEAKER_16]: I only got two letters from attorneys after that appearance so apparently Orange Lounge Radio not only feeds information about games not released but it feeds information to legal counsel over at G4 I would know nothing about that sir

811
00:45:02,147 --> 00:45:13,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I'm asking you because we're just kind of talking about, you know, random stuff in gaming and kind of the gaming scene is that, you know, you kind of bring up a good point that everybody and their brother and sister have a podcast in this day and age.

812
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:16,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you're right, a lot of people have been calling in and plugging their stuff, which is fine.

813
00:45:16,653 --> 00:45:20,634
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all about promoting the indie podcast and I know you guys at All Games are really big on that.

814
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:28,117
[SPEAKER_16]: But what do you think can really help a podcast kind of like distinguish itself amongst all the rest out there?

815
00:45:29,281 --> 00:45:34,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do something that no one else is doing and usually that'll work when you're doing something that you're passionate about.

816
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:56,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you guys hit it on the head when you started out being about Benami because that was what you were passionate about but as you got more comfortable doing your shows, you kind of showed everyone that, hey, not only are we passionate about that but we're passionate about a lot of other things and that's how you kind of expand your show and you get to talk about more varied things but I think to start out,

817
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to start out with something that you're passionate about and something that no one else is talking about.

818
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:08,172
[SPEAKER_05]: If you happen to be into the same stuff that everybody else is into, you can still do it, but try and come at it from a different angle.

819
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Do something different with it.

820
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:11,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

821
00:46:11,513 --> 00:46:11,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead.

822
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I had a couple of toasts I wanted to give to you guys.

823
00:46:23,986 --> 00:46:25,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you want me to wait for that?

824
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:26,407
[SPEAKER_05]: No, go for it.

825
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:28,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got my champagne glass in my hand.

826
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:28,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.

827
00:46:28,588 --> 00:46:30,429
[SPEAKER_34]: I drank all my booze already, so here's some Coke.

828
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:30,910
[SPEAKER_34]: All right.

829
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,050
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the toast?

830
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:35,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, do a line up of guys back if you're doing Coke.

831
00:46:35,232 --> 00:46:36,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

832
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:46,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Being a podcaster, I know that you guys, just like we, don't always get respect from people in the industry, so this first toast addresses that.

833
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:48,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's to the game developers we love.

834
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:51,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's to the game developers who love us.

835
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:56,374
[SPEAKER_05]: The developers we love will never love us, so fuck those developers, and here's to us.

836
00:46:56,794 --> 00:46:58,095
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, good call.

837
00:46:58,155 --> 00:46:58,875
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that one.

838
00:46:59,015 --> 00:46:59,656
[SPEAKER_05]: That is great.

839
00:47:00,536 --> 00:47:04,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and then I have a little haiku, because I know how much you love haikus.

840
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,200
[SPEAKER_28]: I do love haikus.

841
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here we go.

842
00:47:08,522 --> 00:47:12,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope I don't screw this up, because usually Sky corrects my... It's 575, Sky, 575.

843
00:47:12,985 --> 00:47:13,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

844
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:24,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, Jamie, Sky, A Sunday Night Tradition, Lesbians Are Hot.

845
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:28,929
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll drink to that.

846
00:47:28,989 --> 00:47:30,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Lesbians are indeed hot.

847
00:47:30,531 --> 00:47:32,333
[SPEAKER_16]: I might be gay, but I love my lesbians.

848
00:47:32,793 --> 00:47:37,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll save my last one for right before I hang up.

849
00:47:37,098 --> 00:47:38,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you wanted to...

850
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:42,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask me or can I just give you guys some more love?

851
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:42,524
[SPEAKER_16]: I do.

852
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:43,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, really, really quick.

853
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:51,105
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to ask you a question because I know a lot of folks kind of know you as that guy that was on G4 a long time ago and all that stuff.

854
00:47:51,445 --> 00:48:02,247
[SPEAKER_16]: But I kind of rely on that experience that you've had kind of at the far end of this industry, kind of like where gaming media can go, kind of like all the way to the top, so to speak.

855
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:06,808
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of ask, is it possible that gaming can ever –

856
00:48:07,643 --> 00:48:10,264
[SPEAKER_16]: substantiate that type of media again?

857
00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:14,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Will we ever have a true gaming channel in the future, in the next five years, do you think?

858
00:48:15,466 --> 00:48:21,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the problem is that it's going to be difficult for anyone to sustain a channel.

859
00:48:21,207 --> 00:48:23,088
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter if it's games or anything else.

860
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:35,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you look at what's happening now as everything moves to the Internet, IPTV and broadband and Fios, and if you look at game trailers and IGN and GameSpot, they're essentially networks.

861
00:48:36,802 --> 00:48:37,543
[SPEAKER_05]: about games.

862
00:48:37,843 --> 00:48:42,445
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just done in a way that this, I think, audience wants to consume it.

863
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:49,650
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with a regular television channel is that people aren't watching regular television anymore, especially gamers.

864
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,311
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting all their content online.

865
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:53,232
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting it when they want it, how they want it.

866
00:48:53,672 --> 00:49:01,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And the model for reaching that audience just may not be the traditional cable TV model.

867
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:02,437
[SPEAKER_05]: If you notice what's

868
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:26,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Spike TV and what G4 has done is they're casting their net to this wider demographic because I think that once you try to just get gamers on a TV level, there's a belief, not necessarily that it's true, but there's a belief by both the ad community and the executives in television that that group, the gamer group, isn't big enough.

869
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,499
[SPEAKER_05]: You know and I know there's 150 million Americans, there's 800 million Americans,

870
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:33,147
[SPEAKER_05]: and gamers around the world.

871
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:46,897
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think when someone doesn't understand games and they don't know games and they don't play games, it's difficult for them to believe that the audience is there and that it's big enough to support a big television network.

872
00:49:47,177 --> 00:49:49,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the way it's going to happen is it's going to be online.

873
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:55,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we'll ever see a traditional television network that's ad-supported doing it because I just don't think that

874
00:49:56,283 --> 00:49:58,865
[SPEAKER_05]: within the age of 500 channels that there's enough.

875
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:16,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, subscription, maybe, like Gameplay HD and VOOM, I believe that if they're committed to keeping that channel of subscription as part of an overall, not an individual subscription, but an overall HD package, that channel should succeed because, again, it's not reliant on viewers and rating.

876
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:22,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's reliant on the overall company, Rainbow Media and VOOM,

877
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:26,720
[SPEAKER_05]: and being committed to niche programming on HD satellites.

878
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think Gameplay HD is the best chance for a major network.

879
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:32,824
[SPEAKER_05]: It just actually got picked up by Cablevision.

880
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have different networks.

881
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Cablevision is now carrying it as well.

882
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:37,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

883
00:50:37,106 --> 00:50:40,268
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's Gameplay HD or it's YouTube for the rest of us?

884
00:50:40,509 --> 00:50:41,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

885
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,330
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

886
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you wanted to share with us?

887
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:48,854
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always all games because, you know, today audio, tomorrow video.

888
00:50:48,894 --> 00:50:50,415
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on getting our own location.

889
00:50:50,916 --> 00:51:01,205
[SPEAKER_05]: and we'll be doing video every day as soon as we get that place up and running and of course I'm very excited for the day that you guys all come down to our place and christen the new location because

890
00:51:01,973 --> 00:51:07,677
[SPEAKER_05]: as the ashes of Arena fall, so will a new event rise in the heart of Hollywood with all games.

891
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:33,252
[SPEAKER_15]: It's funny seeing a station like that, not so dedicated to games, still getting invited to E3.

892
00:51:33,332 --> 00:51:35,414
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure Scott's sick of hearing about G4.

893
00:51:36,154 --> 00:51:39,636
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even about them getting invited.

894
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:46,420
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about them spending money to try and appease the few gaming audience members they have left.

895
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: They basically siphoned off all the money they were spending on games.

896
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:55,125
[SPEAKER_05]: They got it down to X-Play and a little bit of Attack of the Show and a Cinematek rip-off thing.

897
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:24,178
[SPEAKER_05]: but really it's not about E3 letting them in it's about G4 trying to keep those gamers because let's face it I know you know it the majority of people that still watch G4 even though it's a very small slice of people in the world of cable it's still the gamers nobody is showing up for cops and cheaters and all that crap I don't know I show up for cheaters it's all about the few remaining gamers who are holding out that maybe someday there will be a resurgence but

898
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:26,069
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to happen.

899
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:33,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Their E3 coverage will probably be okay because they'll have Jeff Keighley and Adam and Morgan, but that's about it.

900
00:52:33,515 --> 00:52:34,936
[SPEAKER_16]: And then lots of women in bikinis.

901
00:52:35,837 --> 00:52:38,319
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, because that's what gamers really want.

902
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:40,420
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what gamers and 12-year-old boys really want.

903
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:43,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Scott, we've got to get to some more calls.

904
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:48,626
[SPEAKER_16]: We really appreciate you calling in and everything that you do with AllGames.com and supporting the independent broadcast.

905
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

906
00:52:51,864 --> 00:52:58,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say that like you guys have already laid out for people, this is not about a money making thing.

907
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:08,921
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about trying to be the leader in podcasting because let's face it, it's a very fragmented industry and it's difficult to stand out.

908
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:12,124
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that can allow you to stand out in podcasting is your passion.

909
00:53:12,529 --> 00:53:38,270
[SPEAKER_05]: and when your passion shines through to the audience they will show up, they will reward you not with money and riches but they will reward you with the audience which is, you know, your words only work if people are there to hear them and whether it's 15 or 500 there are clearly people that love Orange Lounge Radio and they're the fuel that keep it running and it's really, it's an inspiration not only to the people that are trying to do podcasting

910
00:53:39,384 --> 00:54:04,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, but to people like me Because, you know, you are the spirit of why I started doing it in the first place And so I close with this You know, Scott, you're very opinionated All three of you all have your own opinions about gaming So I love having you on our show And I love being on your show to debate So I close with this Here's to you and here's to me Podcast friends will always be But shall we ever disagree Then fuck you all and here's to me

911
00:54:05,185 --> 00:54:06,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy anniversary, guys.

912
00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:07,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Very well said.

913
00:54:07,888 --> 00:54:08,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Scott.

914
00:54:08,908 --> 00:54:09,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care, buddy.

915
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:13,433
[SPEAKER_16]: We always enjoy having Scott on the program.

916
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:14,614
[SPEAKER_16]: He's good stuff.

917
00:54:14,754 --> 00:54:16,575
[SPEAKER_16]: That was great.

918
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:18,737
[SPEAKER_16]: You never know who you're going to hear from here on the call-ins.

919
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:20,699
[SPEAKER_16]: See, I really wish we lived closer to them.

920
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:21,160
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

921
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,362
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a six-hour drive to get down there, but we're going to go.

922
00:54:23,782 --> 00:54:26,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I've heard rumblings about what they've got planned.

923
00:54:26,424 --> 00:54:27,285
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds pretty exciting.

924
00:54:27,485 --> 00:54:28,066
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm pretty excited.

925
00:54:28,658 --> 00:54:29,138
[SPEAKER_16]: More calls?

926
00:54:29,338 --> 00:54:30,999
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still trying to work to go to E for All.

927
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:31,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

928
00:54:31,919 --> 00:54:34,600
[SPEAKER_34]: Or E for E. Or, you know, I could do something.

929
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:36,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, how about one more call?

930
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:36,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you can.

931
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:38,062
[SPEAKER_16]: So take this call, Jamie.

932
00:54:39,102 --> 00:54:39,482
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

933
00:54:41,143 --> 00:54:41,723
[SPEAKER_34]: Whoever you are.

934
00:54:41,803 --> 00:54:42,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey.

935
00:54:43,004 --> 00:54:43,404
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

936
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:45,545
[SPEAKER_34]: Dude, the Hulk is calling.

937
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:46,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

938
00:54:46,265 --> 00:54:46,465
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

939
00:54:46,505 --> 00:54:46,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

940
00:54:47,586 --> 00:54:48,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, it's Satan.

941
00:54:49,146 --> 00:54:49,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

942
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:51,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, hi, Satan.

943
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:52,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, boss.

944
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:53,668
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind, Satan?

945
00:54:54,268 --> 00:54:54,909
[SPEAKER_33]: Guess what?

946
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:55,849
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

947
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:56,209
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

948
00:54:56,729 --> 00:54:58,110
[SPEAKER_33]: Your five years are up.

949
00:54:59,878 --> 00:55:02,100
[SPEAKER_33]: Your soul is mine now, bitches.

950
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:04,462
[SPEAKER_34]: I had a full refund, sorry.

951
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:07,644
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, you signed the contract.

952
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,125
[SPEAKER_33]: Your soul is mine.

953
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:14,569
[SPEAKER_34]: You'll have to talk to your secretary about that one, because, you know, that Judas does not know how to keep his paperwork straight.

954
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:19,013
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, don't give me any of this Enron legalese bullshit.

955
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:21,134
[SPEAKER_33]: Your signature is on paper.

956
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,195
[SPEAKER_33]: It's in blood.

957
00:55:22,395 --> 00:55:26,599
[SPEAKER_33]: Didn't you read the small print?

958
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:29,521
[SPEAKER_34]: I have an addendum to that that's also signed in blood.

959
00:55:30,413 --> 00:55:31,634
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, Loki, new job, my right-hand man.

960
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:33,756
[SPEAKER_34]: I need somebody with attitude and balls who doesn't give a shit.

961
00:55:33,816 --> 00:55:34,617
[SPEAKER_34]: Good job, Loki.

962
00:55:58,467 --> 00:56:00,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but you saw the way that Namco made him cry like a little bitch.

963
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, do you really want someone like that working for you?

964
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:09,952
[SPEAKER_33]: Now with the power of the almighty evil that is me behind him, nothing will stand in his way.

965
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:12,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Not even a big ball of Katamari.

966
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:12,914
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we got you.

967
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:15,395
[SPEAKER_33]: Answer you, Jamie.

968
00:56:16,495 --> 00:56:16,895
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes?

969
00:56:17,796 --> 00:56:24,939
[SPEAKER_33]: You will be forced to watch the series finale of SG-1 over and over and over again.

970
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,861
[SPEAKER_33]: because ain't you to me, get blue balls.

971
00:56:28,881 --> 00:56:31,082
[SPEAKER_34]: There's always a start for something.

972
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:31,282
[SPEAKER_34]: And Rob.

973
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:31,863
[SPEAKER_34]: My dear, dear Rob.

974
00:56:32,163 --> 00:56:32,443
Guess what?

975
00:56:32,463 --> 00:56:34,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Pineapple up the ass for you, bitch.

976
00:56:50,706 --> 00:56:53,909
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's just the money I can make on pay-per-view by showing somebody sticking a pineapple up your ass.

977
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:54,409
[SPEAKER_16]: I will rake it in.

978
00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:55,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, that's my job.

979
00:57:17,745 --> 00:57:20,566
[SPEAKER_33]: I am here to lower the moral values of all programs I come in contact with.

980
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:22,886
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, all I have to say is thank God for custom-made earplugs.

981
00:57:47,645 --> 00:57:49,025
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of messed up, Satan.

982
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,246
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, isn't there anything on the show you enjoy?

983
00:57:51,286 --> 00:57:55,607
[SPEAKER_33]: The pain, the pain, the pain.

984
00:57:55,627 --> 00:58:00,628
[SPEAKER_33]: This whole thing is having more fun bouncing off the walls of her cell than anybody listening to you.

985
00:58:02,308 --> 00:58:04,969
[SPEAKER_16]: You're a real jerk, Satan, and I'm about to hang up on you.

986
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:06,389
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, come on.

987
00:58:06,409 --> 00:58:07,029
[SPEAKER_33]: You love me.

988
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:09,410
[SPEAKER_33]: That's why you signed the damn contract.

989
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:11,390
[SPEAKER_16]: But you promised me Dunkin' Donuts.

990
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:14,231
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything else, Satan, that you want to add tonight?

991
00:58:17,391 --> 00:58:22,775
[SPEAKER_33]: Let me think.

992
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:27,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Satan, you're a real asshole, you know that?

993
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:31,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, he hung up.

994
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:31,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Satan hung up.

995
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:37,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Satan, you're a pig fucker.

996
00:58:37,686 --> 00:58:39,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to another call.

997
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:40,028
[SPEAKER_16]: That was brilliant.

998
00:58:40,508 --> 00:58:41,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, this one's yours.

999
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:42,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

1000
00:58:43,851 --> 00:58:44,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is this?

1001
00:58:47,745 --> 00:58:48,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

1002
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

1003
00:58:51,968 --> 00:58:52,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is this?

1004
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,031
[SPEAKER_15]: How's it going?

1005
00:58:57,972 --> 00:58:59,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

1006
00:59:00,694 --> 00:59:03,116
[SPEAKER_16]: God damn, do you know how many edits I'm going to have to do on tonight's show?

1007
00:59:03,236 --> 00:59:05,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Because people can't get their phones to work or whatever it is.

1008
00:59:07,298 --> 00:59:08,499
[SPEAKER_16]: That's alright, we forgive you.

1009
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to another call instead.

1010
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:11,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, this one's yours.

1011
00:59:13,062 --> 00:59:13,823
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello, who is this?

1012
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:15,124
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello?

1013
00:59:15,204 --> 00:59:15,304
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello?

1014
00:59:16,112 --> 00:59:16,872
[SPEAKER_26]: Legend of Zaku.

1015
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:18,493
[SPEAKER_15]: How's it going, Zaku?

1016
00:59:19,713 --> 00:59:20,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, pretty good.

1017
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:20,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Where's Scott?

1018
00:59:21,114 --> 00:59:21,574
[SPEAKER_26]: Where's Scott?

1019
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:23,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott?

1020
00:59:23,234 --> 00:59:24,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Sky or Scott?

1021
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Scott hung up a while ago.

1022
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:27,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Sky's right here with a mouthful of pizza.

1023
00:59:27,996 --> 00:59:28,596
[SPEAKER_26]: No, Rob.

1024
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:29,177
[SPEAKER_14]: No, hi.

1025
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:29,997
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?

1026
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:33,138
[SPEAKER_26]: Just congratulating you on five years, that's all.

1027
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:34,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, don't just congratulate me.

1028
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:35,839
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't do that by myself.

1029
00:59:35,899 --> 00:59:37,039
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and everyone else.

1030
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:39,240
[SPEAKER_26]: The whole ORLR gang, pretty much.

1031
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:44,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'm just trying to wrestle, trying to get this broken monitor to work.

1032
00:59:44,577 --> 00:59:54,283
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, a lot of things have been going on, like that whole Manhunt 2 thing, which I don't even know why.

1033
00:59:54,303 --> 01:00:00,928
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just that Rockstar is kind of like, I kind of feel like they're actually pushing it too far.

1034
01:00:01,849 --> 01:00:03,770
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I don't know.

1035
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:08,353
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I'm all for violence and everything, but I mean... I'm really for violence.

1036
01:00:08,574 --> 01:00:10,275
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, you have to draw a line somewhere.

1037
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:14,598
[SPEAKER_26]: You can't go... You can't be that... You can't be too violent.

1038
01:00:14,738 --> 01:00:22,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but if I want to... I mean, this country was founded on freedom of speech and freedom of expression and freedom of... If I want to do it, shouldn't I be able to do it?

1039
01:00:23,264 --> 01:00:26,806
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, but you also have to understand, you can do it, but...

1040
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,811
[SPEAKER_26]: You're going to have to face, you know, whatever reaction comes back.

1041
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:33,640
[SPEAKER_26]: That's basically you have to face the consequence of your own actions.

1042
01:00:34,153 --> 01:00:36,915
[SPEAKER_15]: And that consequences people thinking you're badass.

1043
01:00:37,255 --> 01:00:44,920
[SPEAKER_26]: Like if you call somebody a racial slur, even though you have the free speech to do it, that's not going to stop you from getting your ass kicked.

1044
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:52,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, but that's different because that's when you are inflicting that upon someone else unwillingly and you're violating their rights.

1045
01:00:52,545 --> 01:00:59,650
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's more the difference between having the legal freedom to do something and having the moral freedom to do something.

1046
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:01,031
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I guess...

1047
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I guess it's kind of both are intertwined.

1048
01:01:05,213 --> 01:01:15,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Basically, even though they have the legal right to do it, it's just, you know, obviously Nintendo or Sony or no other carrier might even pick that one up.

1049
01:01:15,661 --> 01:01:18,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe on PC after the whole Del Sol only thing.

1050
01:01:18,923 --> 01:01:27,810
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, I mean, Rockstar really has to really learn how to, I don't know, just try to be violent, but

1051
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:37,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Even though you have to maintain a level of... I can't find the right word to finish it off with.

1052
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,531
[SPEAKER_26]: Decency.

1053
01:01:40,711 --> 01:01:42,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, can't we all just get along?

1054
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:47,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Can't we just kind of sit around and have some munchies and some Doritos?

1055
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:56,040
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, the important thing is that even though I got adult only, once it's toned down, this shit will sell crazy.

1056
01:01:57,819 --> 01:01:58,379
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll tell you that.

1057
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Zach, you've been a long time listener of the show.

1058
01:02:00,641 --> 01:02:04,123
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you've been listening ever since our Bomani days when we were exclusively talking about DDR.

1059
01:02:04,903 --> 01:02:08,726
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think has been the biggest story in the Bomani world that we've ever covered?

1060
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,787
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure.

1061
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:25,676
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe the... Hold on, let me... The whole... The whole Supernova thing...

1062
01:02:26,414 --> 01:02:29,516
[SPEAKER_26]: You've managed to get first dibs on it in this country.

1063
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:33,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I hear like some water boiling or some bubbles blowing in the background there?

1064
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:40,383
[SPEAKER_16]: No, anyway, yeah, definitely Supernova coming back after such a long absence of DDR Extreme.

1065
01:02:40,743 --> 01:02:41,724
[SPEAKER_16]: And then there was nothing.

1066
01:02:42,064 --> 01:02:45,547
[SPEAKER_16]: And then finally for Supernova to come back kind of really reinvigorated us all.

1067
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:49,629
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, Loki will be the first to tell you that he was one of the first five people in America to play it.

1068
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,270
[SPEAKER_26]: Right, right.

1069
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:53,712
[SPEAKER_26]: Saw you up there that day.

1070
01:02:54,613 --> 01:02:54,773
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1071
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:55,113
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1072
01:02:56,027 --> 01:02:59,309
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, yeah, five years is a long time for everything to change.

1073
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:06,214
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, people coming and going, certain things changing, losing a lot, you know, we lost a lot of people.

1074
01:03:06,234 --> 01:03:07,975
[SPEAKER_26]: Remember Captain Jack?

1075
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Bless his soul.

1076
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:10,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Bless his soul, that's right.

1077
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:12,858
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been doing this show for five years for Captain Jack.

1078
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:14,239
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1079
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,302
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, Zaku, any other last thoughts for our listeners before we move on?

1080
01:03:19,123 --> 01:03:20,023
[SPEAKER_26]: That's pretty much it.

1081
01:03:20,423 --> 01:03:20,744
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1082
01:03:21,124 --> 01:03:24,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one and smoke one for us, buddy.

1083
01:03:25,123 --> 01:03:25,663
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't smoke.

1084
01:03:25,823 --> 01:03:26,403
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

1085
01:03:26,443 --> 01:03:27,564
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm giving you a hard time.

1086
01:03:27,664 --> 01:03:28,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course you don't.

1087
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:29,764
[SPEAKER_13]: How dare I insinuate that?

1088
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:30,744
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1089
01:03:30,784 --> 01:03:31,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one, buddy.

1090
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:36,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Zaku.

1091
01:03:37,326 --> 01:03:37,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I've met him.

1092
01:03:38,326 --> 01:03:39,687
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a good kid in real life.

1093
01:03:39,707 --> 01:03:41,267
[SPEAKER_13]: We give him a hard time on this show sometimes.

1094
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:43,287
[SPEAKER_13]: That's because we do that to our listeners who've called in a bunch.

1095
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:44,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go to another call.

1096
01:03:44,928 --> 01:03:45,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lines.

1097
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we're supposed to get to your segment, huh, Jamie?

1098
01:03:47,268 --> 01:03:47,589
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1099
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:48,469
[SPEAKER_16]: I promise.

1100
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:49,989
[SPEAKER_34]: I have to answer the one call I've been telling you to.

1101
01:03:50,389 --> 01:03:50,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1102
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:51,409
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll get a couple.

1103
01:03:51,449 --> 01:03:51,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

1104
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Orange Lines Radio.

1105
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:53,330
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

1106
01:03:55,762 --> 01:03:56,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

1107
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

1108
01:03:59,805 --> 01:04:00,405
[SPEAKER_34]: It's nobody.

1109
01:04:01,806 --> 01:04:02,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-oh.

1110
01:04:02,727 --> 01:04:04,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Someone having microphone troubles.

1111
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:06,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, your five years are up.

1112
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's the Chromehounds?

1113
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:11,873
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, haha, Chromehound, haha.

1114
01:04:12,313 --> 01:04:15,055
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, whatever happened to that big Chromehounds match we were supposed to have?

1115
01:04:15,095 --> 01:04:15,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is this?

1116
01:04:16,076 --> 01:04:18,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we found out that the game sucked, and then I stopped playing.

1117
01:04:18,497 --> 01:04:20,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Identify yourself, caller, for those that may not know.

1118
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:22,380
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, I'm Bobby.

1119
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Bobby.

1120
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:24,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Bobby.

1121
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,541
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'm not going to say where I'm from because it's about you.

1122
01:04:27,402 --> 01:04:28,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that, Bobby.

1123
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:31,264
[SPEAKER_16]: You can say where you're from, we don't care.

1124
01:04:31,324 --> 01:04:31,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Back east.

1125
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:36,307
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, whatever happened to the Chromehounds match?

1126
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:37,928
[SPEAKER_16]: You just, you know, Chromehounds sucks or what?

1127
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:39,629
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just a horrible game.

1128
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:40,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I had already sold it back.

1129
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:43,351
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, we couldn't get enough people.

1130
01:04:43,371 --> 01:04:44,132
[SPEAKER_15]: He was running from me.

1131
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:45,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Running?

1132
01:04:45,873 --> 01:04:47,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Those things can't even run.

1133
01:04:47,354 --> 01:04:48,975
[SPEAKER_15]: They just slowly move away.

1134
01:04:48,995 --> 01:04:50,656
[SPEAKER_15]: You were slowly waddling away from me.

1135
01:04:51,932 --> 01:04:54,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Bobby, as I understand it, you're Loki's only friend on PlayStation 3.

1136
01:04:54,873 --> 01:04:57,914
[SPEAKER_15]: No, he was my only friend, and now I have like seven.

1137
01:04:58,655 --> 01:04:59,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well, I see.

1138
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,276
[SPEAKER_15]: You haven't added me, have you?

1139
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:03,016
[SPEAKER_16]: You're cheating on Bobby.

1140
01:05:03,256 --> 01:05:05,157
[SPEAKER_16]: No, because I don't play my PlayStation 3.

1141
01:05:05,237 --> 01:05:07,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you guys ever actually played a game together on PlayStation 3?

1142
01:05:08,138 --> 01:05:08,298
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1143
01:05:08,919 --> 01:05:09,439
[SPEAKER_16]: That's sad.

1144
01:05:09,859 --> 01:05:11,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you guys ever played a game together on Xbox?

1145
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:12,900
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't think so.

1146
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,601
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we played Texas Hold'em one time, I think.

1147
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:17,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I remember that.

1148
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:23,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, gosh, Bobby, I know you've been podcasting a long time, too, and doing your thing.

1149
01:05:23,955 --> 01:05:25,137
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think?

1150
01:05:25,257 --> 01:05:27,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Five years is a long time.

1151
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:29,661
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of stuff's happened in the game industry.

1152
01:05:30,102 --> 01:05:37,949
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think has been a real big, important news story in the world of gaming that we should take a moment to reflect on at this, our five-year mark?

1153
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:40,372
[SPEAKER_16]: It's changed the gaming world.

1154
01:05:41,908 --> 01:06:03,802
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that the final rise of rhythm games in the U.S., something that I've been really wanting for a long time because I was a big fan of Bimani games back in college and all that stuff, and finally being able to buy them legitimately for my local game system is really something that I really think is a big deal to me at least.

1155
01:06:04,947 --> 01:06:12,713
[SPEAKER_16]: So, like, how tons of us had to import that shit for years, and now we can just, you know, kind of get a lot of that stuff stateside.

1156
01:06:13,853 --> 01:06:25,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I mean, you know, I mean, that was actually one of the things I wanted to call in to see if you guys had seen about Rock Band via a, you know, Kotaku posts a scan of a magazine that shows the drum peripheral for Rock Band.

1157
01:06:25,662 --> 01:06:26,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have that magazine.

1158
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:29,485
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the drum peripheral, though, it's a concept drum.

1159
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,026
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the artist's rendition.

1160
01:06:31,146 --> 01:06:31,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1161
01:06:32,267 --> 01:06:32,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is, like,

1162
01:06:33,686 --> 01:06:35,267
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1163
01:06:55,641 --> 01:06:59,984
[SPEAKER_16]: It's basically beat the pad instead of necessarily actual drums.

1164
01:07:00,144 --> 01:07:01,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you actually play drums, correct?

1165
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:02,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1166
01:07:02,446 --> 01:07:04,347
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is a subject near and dear to your heart.

1167
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:05,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1168
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:11,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I want a good drum peripheral for the home game, which I didn't think that Drum Mania for the consoles had.

1169
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:14,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the arcade version of Drum Mania.

1170
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:20,019
[SPEAKER_11]: That was actually a Yamaha drum set that I actually considered buying myself, getting the Yamaha DT Express 3.

1171
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:22,420
[SPEAKER_34]: It will work with it, too.

1172
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,462
[SPEAKER_34]: It gives you instructions in the manual how to set it up.

1173
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:36,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but I bought a Roland one anyway, but I think Rock Band, they were saying that they would actually work with all electronic drum sets that use MIDI and stuff, so I won't have to worry about using this controller, but I feel bad for anybody else who does.

1174
01:07:38,524 --> 01:07:39,164
[SPEAKER_16]: I still don't know.

1175
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:40,805
[SPEAKER_16]: The jury's still out on Rock Band for me.

1176
01:07:40,825 --> 01:07:42,025
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see a little more about it.

1177
01:07:42,065 --> 01:07:47,947
[SPEAKER_16]: The concept sounds cool, but I'm kind of a little bit leery of spending all this money on it.

1178
01:07:48,027 --> 01:07:51,409
[SPEAKER_15]: To be honest, it looks a little too similar to Guitar Hero 3.

1179
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:52,389
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean,

1180
01:07:53,151 --> 01:07:54,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 2 Guitar Hero 3

1181
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:15,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Rock Band is actually building on the Guitar Hero code base a little bit.

1182
01:08:15,964 --> 01:08:16,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Very interesting.

1183
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:22,889
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to ask you real quick, because I know you're a fan of Beat Mania, as you've claimed is one of your favorite games of all time.

1184
01:08:23,929 --> 01:08:26,691
[SPEAKER_16]: You kind of had me thinking about the whole Japanese-US thing.

1185
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:31,875
[SPEAKER_16]: You really can't get a game like Beat Mania here in the US like you can in Japan, though, right?

1186
01:08:32,175 --> 01:08:34,636
[SPEAKER_16]: So to some need, there's still a big need to import.

1187
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:40,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, I mean, all the good songs are on 2DX that you have to import.

1188
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:47,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still importing those because I'm sorry the Britney Spears one on the US Beatmania doesn't cover it.

1189
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,140
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do like the US controller for Beatmania more than the Japanese home controller.

1190
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,160
[SPEAKER_16]: They did fix that.

1191
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:52,840
[SPEAKER_16]: They sure did.

1192
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:55,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Real quick comment in chat that I think is interesting.

1193
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:56,541
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize, chat room.

1194
01:08:56,581 --> 01:08:57,502
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't been ignoring you.

1195
01:08:57,522 --> 01:08:59,062
[SPEAKER_16]: We've just been focusing so much on the callers.

1196
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:06,404
[SPEAKER_16]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, Super hardcore Bomani fans refuse to give Rock Band a chance and are already judging it.

1197
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,791
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think about those people that are judging the game?

1198
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:12,951
[SPEAKER_16]: Do they do that just because, I don't know, they're ignorant?

1199
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:15,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Or do they do that because Guitar Hero was disappointing to them?

1200
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:28,254
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sad because I think that if Konami really took a risk and released Guitar Freak's Drum Mania over here and then later on with Karaoke Revolution we could already have something like this and they could be dominating the market.

1201
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:32,855
[SPEAKER_15]: But instead they have focus on other places.

1202
01:09:33,646 --> 01:10:01,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami's problem was that they insisted on keeping all the J-rock and the J-pop and all that stuff which is great for that segment and great for their current fans but to get the rest of the audience they needed to put in songs that people here recognized and they never did that even when hip-hop mania was tested in arcades it was still all the J-pop and all that stuff so that's where Harmonix picked it up and said hey let's do this and they put in songs people recognized and it became a big hit

1203
01:10:03,521 --> 01:10:03,962
[SPEAKER_16]: That's true.

1204
01:10:04,002 --> 01:10:19,231
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of one thing we've kind of said a lot on this show that Guitar Hero has a lot to thank for its success is the fact that they made the song list a lot smarter and they were able to take a little more risks on it whereas Konami was always playing it safe and felt that the game would sell itself which is the engine.

1205
01:10:20,232 --> 01:10:23,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Well they didn't know how they would market a guitar game over here.

1206
01:10:24,195 --> 01:10:28,357
[SPEAKER_15]: That was their exact, well my sales rep's opinion on it.

1207
01:10:28,397 --> 01:10:32,460
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't know how they would be able to market it over here which is like dumb but

1208
01:10:33,747 --> 01:10:35,449
[SPEAKER_11]: People look at it and then play it.

1209
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:42,695
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of Guitar Hero marketing is because Best Buy has it set up and people just walk up and try to play it.

1210
01:10:42,895 --> 01:10:45,757
[SPEAKER_11]: That's most of their marketing and a lot of people have bought it because of that.

1211
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:50,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Very similar to the Wii, I would say.

1212
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,523
[SPEAKER_16]: You kind of see somebody playing it and then you're like, wow, I want to try that.

1213
01:10:52,963 --> 01:10:55,345
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of different.

1214
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:58,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Bobby, we've got to get some more calls and move on, but anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1215
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:02,226
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's just congrats on the five years.

1216
01:11:02,326 --> 01:11:04,547
[SPEAKER_11]: I know how hard the first hundred was for me.

1217
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:16,973
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do want to just share this, and I promise it will only be about a minute long, is that I was scared to email the mailbag about two years ago when it was still the to-go edition and stuff.

1218
01:11:16,993 --> 01:11:21,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And I remember it took me a couple weeks to get the courage to even email Jamie asking about...

1219
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:29,045
[SPEAKER_11]: High Definition Television Lag Fearing Her Wrath Beatmania I think I was nice, wasn't I?

1220
01:11:29,245 --> 01:11:30,826
[SPEAKER_16]: She's nice to most of our emailers.

1221
01:11:31,826 --> 01:11:45,492
[SPEAKER_11]: You were, but it was just kind of like, oh, these are the guys I've been listening to for so long because I had heard of you guys and I had listened before the podcast came around and stuff and it was kind of like the whole celebrity, oh, I don't know if I want to bother them and stuff like that.

1222
01:11:46,952 --> 01:11:50,554
[SPEAKER_11]: But you guys did inspire me to do what I do and I know you've inspired a lot of other people.

1223
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:51,951
[SPEAKER_11]: and thank you for that.

1224
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:54,292
[SPEAKER_16]: That is truly the ultimate compliment.

1225
01:11:54,672 --> 01:11:56,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Compliments don't get much bigger than that, honestly.

1226
01:11:56,592 --> 01:11:57,032
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1227
01:11:58,332 --> 01:11:59,073
[SPEAKER_16]: It's amazing.

1228
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:01,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, Bobby.

1229
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:09,915
[SPEAKER_16]: We look forward to at least another 100 episodes from you and working with you to help make those a success as well as all the things we partner up to do.

1230
01:12:11,275 --> 01:12:12,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks so much and thanks for doing this.

1231
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:13,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Now talk about games.

1232
01:12:13,915 --> 01:12:14,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll try.

1233
01:12:14,716 --> 01:12:15,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Bobby.

1234
01:12:15,796 --> 01:12:16,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

1235
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:22,802
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, one more call, then we'll get to Jamie's bit, and then we'll take more calls, because we've still got some energy left in us.

1236
01:12:22,842 --> 01:12:24,383
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to do a long show tonight, that's alright.

1237
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:27,045
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi!

1238
01:12:27,805 --> 01:12:29,206
[SPEAKER_34]: We finally got to your call.

1239
01:12:29,947 --> 01:12:31,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Yo, what's up everyone?

1240
01:12:31,888 --> 01:12:32,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey!

1241
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:33,269
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi!

1242
01:12:34,269 --> 01:12:35,550
[SPEAKER_19]: What's good, people?

1243
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:39,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Amy, you know our call, you know it's official.

1244
01:12:39,613 --> 01:12:40,893
[SPEAKER_19]: The party cannot begin, I'm here.

1245
01:12:41,374 --> 01:12:41,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay!

1246
01:12:41,974 --> 01:12:43,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Toga, toga.

1247
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,002
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1248
01:13:02,731 --> 01:13:06,594
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, episode 69 is definitely the best episode ever.

1249
01:13:06,895 --> 01:13:12,259
[SPEAKER_19]: I definitely vote on that, and you guys gotta put it up on RSS people, keep the download.

1250
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:14,001
[SPEAKER_19]: They gotta hear I'm staying in.

1251
01:13:14,141 --> 01:13:14,741
[SPEAKER_19]: They got to.

1252
01:13:15,742 --> 01:13:16,583
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see what we can do.

1253
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:18,885
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about they have to hear that, but...

1254
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,081
[SPEAKER_15]: You have no say in this, man.

1255
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:21,581
[SPEAKER_16]: The fans demand it.

1256
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:21,981
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go.

1257
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:22,501
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go.

1258
01:13:22,521 --> 01:13:23,742
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I'm talking about.

1259
01:13:23,782 --> 01:13:23,882
[SPEAKER_19]: Now...

1260
01:13:47,841 --> 01:14:10,660
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I started my own podcast, and I have to say, you guys were the reason why I started doing this again, you know, because before all of this, I used to run my little two-hour music special on my friggin' cable connection, you know, like maybe every two weeks or whatever, and I just stopped doing it, and after I started listening to you guys again, I'm like, you know, I gotta get into it, you know?

1261
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,882
[SPEAKER_19]: I started listening to other podcasts about anime.

1262
01:14:13,942 --> 01:14:14,843
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't get into it.

1263
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:16,017
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1264
01:14:37,366 --> 01:14:38,306
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to get that personal.

1265
01:14:38,326 --> 01:14:40,087
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm only your friend, Ranma, that's all.

1266
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:42,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, you guys got anything for Ranma?

1267
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:44,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, you've been here to talk to Ranma all night?

1268
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:06,751
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

1269
01:15:07,432 --> 01:15:08,052
[SPEAKER_34]: Hey.

1270
01:15:08,552 --> 01:15:09,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I want to come to New York.

1271
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I want to come back out to Cali one more time.

1272
01:15:13,315 --> 01:15:13,795
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll try.

1273
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe by the end of the year, I'll bring a crew with me.

1274
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:16,256
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe.

1275
01:15:16,677 --> 01:15:17,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

1276
01:15:17,497 --> 01:15:18,278
[SPEAKER_34]: We'll have a barbecue.

1277
01:15:18,438 --> 01:15:18,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

1278
01:15:18,898 --> 01:15:19,638
[SPEAKER_16]: I got a question.

1279
01:15:20,379 --> 01:15:23,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you guys, your little banter there inspired a question here.

1280
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:31,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Ranma, what are the differences you think, because you've been to both coasts now, what do you think are the differences between the East Coast scene and the West Coast scene?

1281
01:15:32,515 --> 01:15:39,079
[SPEAKER_16]: The gaming and anime scene, because, you know, I know we have a lot of listeners of the show who are deeply, you know, who have anime as a passion as well.

1282
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:41,621
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you don't, just, you know, tune out for a couple seconds.

1283
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:45,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Ranma, what would you say is the difference between the gaming and anime scene in the East Coast and West Coast?

1284
01:15:46,023 --> 01:15:56,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I can't say too, too much, but it used to be the West Coast was all about the con, the cosplay, the time you put into making that costume.

1285
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,111
[SPEAKER_19]: The East Coast was like,

1286
01:15:58,536 --> 01:16:04,200
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't give a flying fuck if you did put 100 hours into that freaking Sephiroth costume.

1287
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,841
[SPEAKER_19]: How much alcohol can you take Saturday night?

1288
01:16:07,222 --> 01:16:08,442
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it was always about.

1289
01:16:08,803 --> 01:16:10,083
[SPEAKER_19]: West Coast was the cosplay.

1290
01:16:10,324 --> 01:16:11,544
[SPEAKER_19]: East Coast was about the party.

1291
01:16:11,764 --> 01:16:12,385
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1292
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:14,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Faname has always kind of been about who can hold their liquor.

1293
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,247
[SPEAKER_19]: It's blending now.

1294
01:16:16,287 --> 01:16:22,952
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I see on the West Coast, people over there, the West Coast is more fun, more friendly, you know?

1295
01:16:22,992 --> 01:16:23,832
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I saw.

1296
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:25,933
[SPEAKER_19]: When I was at Faname, I really had a great time.

1297
01:16:26,334 --> 01:16:26,674
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean...

1298
01:16:27,327 --> 01:16:28,708
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of props to people.

1299
01:16:28,748 --> 01:16:34,091
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see a lot of that over on the East Coast, because half the time, it's all about the fucking drama shit.

1300
01:16:34,191 --> 01:16:37,233
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, on the West Coast, I know there's drama, but they keep it on the down low.

1301
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:42,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas on the East Coast, all it takes is somebody to walk past, let the drama roll begin, you know?

1302
01:16:42,996 --> 01:16:43,857
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just too much.

1303
01:16:44,397 --> 01:16:45,438
[SPEAKER_19]: It depends on the clicks.

1304
01:16:46,218 --> 01:16:54,803
[SPEAKER_19]: That too, and it's like, and whereas me, I'm with multiple clicks, and it's like, I gotta be careful who I chill with, and I bet if I had those same clicks on the West Coast...

1305
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:56,708
[SPEAKER_19]: The drama shit wouldn't even bother.

1306
01:16:56,748 --> 01:16:58,030
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like, fine, whatever.

1307
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:58,811
[SPEAKER_19]: We're all hanging out.

1308
01:16:58,891 --> 01:16:59,832
[SPEAKER_19]: We're all going to have a good time.

1309
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:03,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, go ahead.

1310
01:17:03,996 --> 01:17:10,683
[SPEAKER_19]: As for the gaming, I would say, you know, one thing about the West Coast, the gamers know how to use deodorant.

1311
01:17:10,883 --> 01:17:11,964
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I can say.

1312
01:17:12,264 --> 01:17:12,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Definitely.

1313
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,490
[SPEAKER_34]: I didn't really catch too much fanboy funk this year, though.

1314
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

1315
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:18,831
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean,

1316
01:17:19,212 --> 01:17:25,534
[SPEAKER_19]: You go to like Otacon, which is like the big connect, you walk in, you're going to get smacked in the face with a wave of funk.

1317
01:17:25,814 --> 01:17:26,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously.

1318
01:17:28,015 --> 01:17:29,695
[SPEAKER_34]: And not the good George Clinton kind, right?

1319
01:17:30,175 --> 01:17:30,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

1320
01:17:31,296 --> 01:17:31,616
[SPEAKER_34]: Mm-hmm.

1321
01:17:33,656 --> 01:17:36,697
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's kind of funky in here because we've been, you know, smelling Rob.

1322
01:17:36,937 --> 01:17:37,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, shut up.

1323
01:17:37,717 --> 01:17:38,938
[SPEAKER_16]: I took a shower today just for you.

1324
01:17:39,558 --> 01:17:40,698
[SPEAKER_34]: Maybe some of your sneakers are on.

1325
01:17:41,459 --> 01:17:45,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I just had to run out and check on the air situation because we're burning up in here, so anyway.

1326
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:45,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1327
01:17:46,773 --> 01:17:50,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Ranma, thanks so much for the call and for being a friend.

1328
01:17:50,436 --> 01:17:51,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being a friend.

1329
01:17:52,837 --> 01:17:56,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, before I go, I have to do the same toast I did last year.

1330
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,902
[SPEAKER_19]: Even though somebody stole it, I'm going to do it.

1331
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:00,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Go for it.

1332
01:18:00,783 --> 01:18:03,725
[SPEAKER_19]: In my hand is a can of Guinness.

1333
01:18:04,025 --> 01:18:06,146
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to crack it open right now.

1334
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:08,988
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the last sip of champagne left in my glass.

1335
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:10,770
[SPEAKER_34]: I have champagne in my belly.

1336
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Then I'll toast DarkSakura's belly.

1337
01:18:13,551 --> 01:18:13,752
[SPEAKER_34]: No.

1338
01:18:13,812 --> 01:18:13,872
[SPEAKER_34]: No.

1339
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:17,074
[SPEAKER_34]: I have Guinness at home, so I'll just do it when I get home.

1340
01:18:17,094 --> 01:18:17,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, take it away, Ranma.

1341
01:18:18,335 --> 01:18:18,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go.

1342
01:18:18,996 --> 01:18:22,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's to you, here's to me, the best a friend will ever be.

1343
01:18:22,758 --> 01:18:26,701
[SPEAKER_19]: If we ever happen to disagree, well, fuck you, and here's to me.

1344
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:28,042
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm drinking this bitch down.

1345
01:18:29,283 --> 01:18:29,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Very well said.

1346
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:35,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually just tried to use the champagne glass as a microphone.

1347
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:37,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, no.

1348
01:18:39,591 --> 01:18:39,831
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1349
01:18:40,746 --> 01:18:42,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll talk to you guys.

1350
01:18:42,168 --> 01:18:44,991
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll see you guys sometime again.

1351
01:18:45,272 --> 01:18:45,772
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to happen.

1352
01:18:45,792 --> 01:18:46,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Peace.

1353
01:18:59,512 --> 01:19:00,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you not want to do mailbag tonight?

1354
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,154
[SPEAKER_34]: I could do mailbag, but no.

1355
01:19:02,214 --> 01:19:03,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do a couple emails.

1356
01:19:03,154 --> 01:19:03,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1357
01:19:03,574 --> 01:19:06,115
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, because some folks, not everybody can get in on the phone.

1358
01:19:06,696 --> 01:19:10,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And I really apologize to those of you calling on the phone like crazy.

1359
01:19:11,298 --> 01:19:15,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Some folks have been calling in seriously since we started taking calls and still haven't gotten through.

1360
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,741
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to take more calls very soon, I promise.

1361
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:25,464
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to get to the email bags and then more calls, and we'll hopefully get everybody that's trying to call in, even if we have to go to the two-minute lightning round.

1362
01:19:25,564 --> 01:19:26,245
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, here we go.

1363
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:27,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Mailbag time.

1364
01:19:32,883 --> 01:19:34,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1365
01:19:34,805 --> 01:19:37,407
[SPEAKER_16]: We always welcome your emails and DarkSakura is going to read them right now.

1366
01:19:38,288 --> 01:19:38,608
[SPEAKER_34]: I am?

1367
01:19:39,629 --> 01:19:39,849
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay.

1368
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:40,569
[SPEAKER_16]: It's you better.

1369
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:45,353
[SPEAKER_34]: First email is, Dear OLR, I have one simple question.

1370
01:19:45,393 --> 01:19:47,435
[SPEAKER_34]: What the hell happened to White Knight for the PS3?

1371
01:19:47,895 --> 01:19:51,338
[SPEAKER_34]: Keep up the great work, your Serbian listener, Alyosha.

1372
01:19:52,879 --> 01:19:55,181
[SPEAKER_34]: PS Level 5 needs to make another Dark Cloud game.

1373
01:19:55,851 --> 01:19:56,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the foggiest idea.

1374
01:19:56,871 --> 01:19:57,892
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't been following that game.

1375
01:19:57,932 --> 01:19:59,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, you know anything about this?

1376
01:19:59,032 --> 01:20:00,613
[SPEAKER_16]: This is more up your alley with the whole title.

1377
01:20:00,633 --> 01:20:01,713
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just not come out yet.

1378
01:20:02,213 --> 01:20:02,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it delayed?

1379
01:20:03,054 --> 01:20:03,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Canceled?

1380
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:04,514
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just kind of sleeping?

1381
01:20:04,894 --> 01:20:05,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably sleeping.

1382
01:20:06,175 --> 01:20:06,515
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1383
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:07,575
[SPEAKER_16]: You know where White Knight is?

1384
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:08,716
[SPEAKER_16]: It's with Africa.

1385
01:20:09,536 --> 01:20:10,356
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where White Knight went.

1386
01:20:10,376 --> 01:20:11,537
[SPEAKER_16]: The White Knight went to Africa.

1387
01:20:12,597 --> 01:20:13,077
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where it is.

1388
01:20:14,298 --> 01:20:14,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1389
01:20:14,858 --> 01:20:15,598
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't know, buddy.

1390
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:16,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, they haven't said anything.

1391
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:17,379
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the best we got.

1392
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Unless chatroom knows something, we don't.

1393
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,820
[SPEAKER_34]: What does the chatroom know that we don't?

1394
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:23,281
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just saying Africa.

1395
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,142
[SPEAKER_34]: Rob, I'll stop making hate mail.

1396
01:20:27,162 --> 01:20:31,706
[SPEAKER_34]: I've decided to make more emails begging Loki to play more Drunken Mario Kart GP.

1397
01:20:50,703 --> 01:21:00,629
[SPEAKER_34]: The annoying 12-year-old who wants a more drunken Mario Kart needs another arcade because the last one left doesn't have DDR but has initial D. But we're suing the place, and so it isn't smart to go there.

1398
01:21:00,669 --> 01:21:02,831
[SPEAKER_34]: Still youngest listener, DDR Maniac, and that's all.

1399
01:21:03,611 --> 01:21:04,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, that's a hell of a signature.

1400
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for backing off for once.

1401
01:21:07,774 --> 01:21:09,555
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, YouTube.

1402
01:21:10,075 --> 01:21:11,456
[SPEAKER_16]: We need more stuff on YouTube.

1403
01:21:12,477 --> 01:21:16,179
[SPEAKER_16]: My camera does a lot of better digital stuff now, so we need to do some craziness on YouTube.

1404
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:18,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, drink, and then we'll film you.

1405
01:21:18,881 --> 01:21:19,201
[SPEAKER_16]: It's funny.

1406
01:21:22,029 --> 01:21:25,153
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm sifting through the emails because I want to get some of them read.

1407
01:21:27,295 --> 01:21:28,617
[SPEAKER_34]: One of them is MasterKiller.

1408
01:21:29,654 --> 01:21:32,756
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, I hear that Rob bought Puzzle Quest on DS.

1409
01:21:33,156 --> 01:21:34,797
[SPEAKER_34]: I recently purchased the game on PSP.

1410
01:21:35,397 --> 01:21:37,858
[SPEAKER_34]: The game is great, but the game freezes every second.

1411
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:38,979
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not sure what it is.

1412
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:42,181
[SPEAKER_34]: I looked in all the forums, and I'm not the only one.

1413
01:21:42,381 --> 01:21:48,004
[SPEAKER_34]: Does the glitches and freezes occur only on the DS version you have?

1414
01:21:48,444 --> 01:21:50,665
[SPEAKER_34]: Did you hear anything about a recaller patch coming soon?

1415
01:21:50,765 --> 01:21:51,586
[SPEAKER_34]: PS, love the show.

1416
01:21:51,726 --> 01:21:52,206
[SPEAKER_34]: Smile face.

1417
01:21:52,762 --> 01:21:53,723
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1418
01:22:16,204 --> 01:22:17,165
[SPEAKER_16]: That sounds like a good idea.

1419
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:17,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Next email, shall I?

1420
01:22:30,715 --> 01:22:34,339
[SPEAKER_34]: Hey OLR crew, first and foremost, congratulations on your 5th anniversary.

1421
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,724
[SPEAKER_34]: OB continued to output the same level of awesomeness or higher in the future.

1422
01:22:39,225 --> 01:22:47,575
[SPEAKER_34]: I started listening to OLR last year after looking for Orange Lounge songs to put on my MySpace profile, only to stumble on the OLR MySpace page.

1423
01:22:48,215 --> 01:22:58,498
[SPEAKER_34]: My first episode, funnily enough, was the fourth anniversary episode, which kept me busy during freshman orientation at my college campus when I have nothing to do and on a road trip to Reno.

1424
01:22:58,998 --> 01:23:02,779
[SPEAKER_34]: On another note, something about the OLR after-birth cage match has been bugging me lately.

1425
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:09,141
[SPEAKER_34]: Songs that win supposedly get put in rotation on the stream, which I've listened to while playing Albatross 18.

1426
01:23:10,722 --> 01:23:14,783
[SPEAKER_34]: Yet the only cage match winner I've heard on the stream is Loki's Zodiac Don't Play Nice Mashup.

1427
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:18,531
[SPEAKER_34]: Are these songs actually being put in play, or am I just listening at the wrong times?

1428
01:23:18,671 --> 01:23:20,732
[SPEAKER_34]: Love, GS68.

1429
01:23:21,452 --> 01:23:28,054
[SPEAKER_16]: They are, but the problem is we have a 16-hour playlist on the regular station, and it only is going to come up once in that time.

1430
01:23:28,915 --> 01:23:39,178
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like you've heard it once, but the problem is it's one song in a huge rotation of music, so unfortunately it doesn't always come up.

1431
01:23:39,599 --> 01:23:43,540
[SPEAKER_16]: And sometimes it does go into rotation late in the week because I'm lazy.

1432
01:23:45,365 --> 01:23:46,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Last email.

1433
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:56,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Honestly, though, I have to admit, Cage Match Song going into rotation is the last priority behind getting the podcast out on time and all that, making sure all games gets the syndicated run and all that stuff.

1434
01:23:57,249 --> 01:23:57,749
[SPEAKER_34]: Last email.

1435
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:04,291
[SPEAKER_34]: Dear Orange Challenge Radio, collectively known as Rob, Matt, and Jamie, congratulations on five years of being a festering rash on the internet.

1436
01:24:04,591 --> 01:24:05,631
[SPEAKER_34]: JK, heart, heart, heart, heart.

1437
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,281
[SPEAKER_34]: Seriously, though, you guys are freaking awesome.

1438
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:13,425
[SPEAKER_34]: I first learned about LLR through DDR Freak Forums because someone had a link in their signature and decided to check it out.

1439
01:24:13,765 --> 01:24:18,128
[SPEAKER_34]: Unfortunately, I was an internet noob and had no idea what was going on, so I just thought it was a music station.

1440
01:24:18,449 --> 01:24:19,590
[SPEAKER_34]: That was three or four years ago.

1441
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:20,130
[SPEAKER_34]: Smalthies.

1442
01:24:20,942 --> 01:24:26,248
[SPEAKER_34]: Fall of 05 was when I rediscovered OLR and learned about your now-deceased, frowny-faced OLR to-go edition.

1443
01:24:26,468 --> 01:24:28,710
[SPEAKER_34]: Isn't this for what we're doing, like, for the whole show now?

1444
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:39,502
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, kinda, but you know, some people liked it better in its compact format, but you know, we have to make decisions based on what we think is best, and you can't please everybody, so sorry you didn't agree.

1445
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:43,914
[SPEAKER_34]: It was an hour slash hour and a half of news.

1446
01:24:44,034 --> 01:24:47,015
[SPEAKER_34]: Rob being funny, Jamie being angry, and Matt hating on Max.

1447
01:24:47,075 --> 01:24:47,495
[SPEAKER_34]: Woohoo.

1448
01:24:47,595 --> 01:24:48,595
[SPEAKER_34]: That was my freshman year.

1449
01:24:49,015 --> 01:24:49,776
[SPEAKER_34]: Now I'm a junior.

1450
01:24:50,116 --> 01:24:51,076
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, going to be one.

1451
01:24:51,436 --> 01:24:53,477
[SPEAKER_34]: P. The tongue face.

1452
01:24:53,997 --> 01:24:57,158
[SPEAKER_34]: And I've listened to every episode of OLR since you guys started the new format.

1453
01:24:57,418 --> 01:25:00,959
[SPEAKER_34]: You three are my main source of gaming information with Kotaku filling in the blanks.

1454
01:25:01,339 --> 01:25:02,839
[SPEAKER_34]: And also a big source of entertainment.

1455
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:06,941
[SPEAKER_34]: I have to say that it's mildly awkward when one of you are Rice Princess or Exifer or Casper the Gay.

1456
01:25:07,721 --> 01:25:08,321
[SPEAKER_34]: With an O face.

1457
01:25:08,883 --> 01:25:15,044
[SPEAKER_34]: or anyone else says some hilarious and I burst into laughter in the train and other public place which leads to weird stares and crap mutterings.

1458
01:25:15,084 --> 01:25:16,144
[SPEAKER_34]: That kid is crazy.

1459
01:25:16,965 --> 01:25:17,905
[SPEAKER_34]: Of course, that's half the fun.

1460
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:28,787
[SPEAKER_34]: I want to get mushy but that's too weird so I'll just leave it at that and congratulate you guys on five years of being some of the coolest people on the internet and wish you luck in the next five years.

1461
01:25:29,187 --> 01:25:31,528
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll make a shirt that says I grew up with Orange Lounge.

1462
01:25:32,208 --> 01:25:34,948
[SPEAKER_34]: Sincerely yours with hearts and love.

1463
01:25:35,228 --> 01:25:36,669
[SPEAKER_34]: Heart, heart, heart, heart.

1464
01:25:36,769 --> 01:25:37,149
[SPEAKER_34]: Sycoon.

1465
01:25:37,689 --> 01:25:37,989
[SPEAKER_34]: P.S.

1466
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:38,609
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a cute email.

1467
01:25:39,324 --> 01:25:42,606
[SPEAKER_34]: I bought Pac-Man CE and I'm not sure why, cry cry.

1468
01:25:43,326 --> 01:25:46,147
[SPEAKER_34]: PPS, shoot the whoop, charging my lasers.

1469
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:47,268
[SPEAKER_34]: What?

1470
01:25:47,488 --> 01:25:48,728
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know, but it's funny.

1471
01:25:48,748 --> 01:25:52,450
[SPEAKER_16]: They just wanted you to say that on air so they could cut that out and have that as a sound effect.

1472
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:52,790
[SPEAKER_34]: That's great.

1473
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Shoot the whoop.

1474
01:25:54,511 --> 01:25:56,612
[SPEAKER_34]: I just go around saying, charging my lasers.

1475
01:25:56,872 --> 01:25:57,413
[SPEAKER_34]: Shoot the whoop.

1476
01:25:57,433 --> 01:25:58,293
[SPEAKER_34]: That was awesome.

1477
01:25:58,513 --> 01:26:00,654
[SPEAKER_34]: You need to send emails like that again so I can say more cool stuff.

1478
01:26:00,694 --> 01:26:03,916
[SPEAKER_16]: You play Pac-Man CE for the Rayvar music, that's why.

1479
01:26:05,476 --> 01:26:06,197
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you play it.

1480
01:26:06,337 --> 01:26:06,737
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

1481
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:08,917
[SPEAKER_34]: Hey peoples of OLR, congratulations to 5 years of OLR.

1482
01:26:08,937 --> 01:26:13,120
[SPEAKER_34]: I must admit that I feel kinda old being around for most of those 5 years.

1483
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:16,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Going back to the drunk episodes and the randomness that is the 3 hour show.

1484
01:26:34,545 --> 01:26:38,947
[SPEAKER_34]: I have so much praise for you guys, Sky, DarkSakura, and Loki, and everyone else who has made this show what it is today.

1485
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:47,851
[SPEAKER_34]: So yeah, the reason I'm writing, just recently or probably already implemented the game review site that nobody gives two shits about, NoNotOneUp, GameSpot is going to change its rating systems this week.

1486
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:51,632
[SPEAKER_34]: They state that they are going to a .5 base system, no more 8.8 like scores.

1487
01:26:53,013 --> 01:26:53,833
[SPEAKER_34]: And I lost my place.

1488
01:26:54,466 --> 01:26:57,907
[SPEAKER_34]: and going to remove the sub-score system for graphics, gameplay, sound, etc.

1489
01:26:57,967 --> 01:27:07,830
[SPEAKER_34]: They are going to add medal-slash-reward-slash-achievement-slash-e-penis points for things like excellent graphics and sound to blatant overwhoring of advertisements and overall suck.

1490
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:11,010
[SPEAKER_34]: As for many listeners, including myself, we could give a shit!

1491
01:27:12,051 --> 01:27:16,672
[SPEAKER_34]: But it got me thinking, why are people so fixated with a 7 out of 10 score for an average game?

1492
01:27:17,293 --> 01:27:19,094
[SPEAKER_34]: Why, whatever happened to a 5 being averaged?

1493
01:27:19,154 --> 01:27:20,054
[SPEAKER_34]: Is it too low for people?

1494
01:27:20,295 --> 01:27:21,755
[SPEAKER_34]: Is it too close to a 3 or a 1?

1495
01:27:22,055 --> 01:27:26,097
[SPEAKER_34]: Do fanboys have a splintered... By the way, fanboys, to make it plural, you do not add an apostrophe.

1496
01:27:26,598 --> 01:27:28,659
[SPEAKER_34]: Have a splintered baseball bat stuck up their ass?

1497
01:27:28,859 --> 01:27:29,579
[SPEAKER_34]: Who the fuck knows?

1498
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:33,541
[SPEAKER_34]: I would like to ask if any of the current rating systems work, or do they need to all be revamped?

1499
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,002
[SPEAKER_34]: And Hal, thanks for your time.

1500
01:27:35,502 --> 01:27:36,323
[SPEAKER_34]: GS191.

1501
01:27:36,823 --> 01:27:37,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, heavy question.

1502
01:27:38,264 --> 01:27:41,565
[SPEAKER_34]: It's because now people... I read that like the biggest run-on sentence ever.

1503
01:27:41,745 --> 01:27:42,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously?

1504
01:27:42,186 --> 01:27:47,048
[SPEAKER_15]: If you were to look at, like, mathematically, yes, 5 would be, you know, averaged.

1505
01:27:47,483 --> 01:27:54,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Although people are looking at it like grade scores, which, you know, 50% would be failure and 70% would be average.

1506
01:27:55,025 --> 01:28:01,927
[SPEAKER_15]: So, unfortunately, everybody's sucking that school mentality, and that's why the rating system's all fucked up.

1507
01:28:02,727 --> 01:28:07,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's actually a five-point system instead of ten, because those bottom five are failures.

1508
01:28:10,569 --> 01:28:11,089
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I don't...

1509
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,340
[SPEAKER_16]: And I might rent it.

1510
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,400
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1511
01:28:58,712 --> 01:29:03,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can pretty much guarantee that they're always going to be negative because they're holding off on playing them until later on.

1512
01:29:04,236 --> 01:29:12,143
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it could be stuff that's not half bad, but they have a vendetta against certain things like, you know, for example, Fantastic Four or something.

1513
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:17,847
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll say, well, I don't like Fantastic Four, so it gets a lower review or something like that.

1514
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,817
[SPEAKER_15]: But this isn't what I remember from the comics.

1515
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:24,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Review it as a game, not as what you remember from the comics.

1516
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:30,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Some folks in chat room are talking about X-Play, and JV Mon says, I hate X-Play's Para Para Paradise review.

1517
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:34,423
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, it just goes to show you some people don't get it.

1518
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:39,265
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, but there's a lot of games out there to play, and sometimes people don't get the things that other folks are into.

1519
01:29:39,285 --> 01:29:39,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing.

1520
01:29:39,745 --> 01:29:42,447
[SPEAKER_15]: They weren't actually reviewing Para Para Paradise.

1521
01:29:42,787 --> 01:29:44,167
[SPEAKER_15]: They were doing a funny bit.

1522
01:29:44,347 --> 01:29:45,288
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all they were doing.

1523
01:29:45,308 --> 01:29:46,668
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, really, it hasn't come up.

1524
01:29:46,688 --> 01:29:47,969
[SPEAKER_15]: That's questionable if it was funny or not.

1525
01:29:48,496 --> 01:29:49,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they were doing a bit, okay?

1526
01:29:49,696 --> 01:29:50,657
[SPEAKER_15]: It hasn't come over here.

1527
01:29:51,397 --> 01:29:53,458
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a game that was released in the United States.

1528
01:29:53,978 --> 01:29:55,258
[SPEAKER_15]: So why were they reviewing it?

1529
01:29:55,619 --> 01:29:56,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, to be funny.

1530
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:57,839
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why they were doing it.

1531
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Because who doesn't like to laugh at someone playing Power of Paradise?

1532
01:30:02,341 --> 01:30:06,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's such a girly game, and people, you know, like making fun of that.

1533
01:30:07,043 --> 01:30:07,323
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1534
01:30:07,943 --> 01:30:10,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, anything else, I guess?

1535
01:30:10,124 --> 01:30:10,764
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that was the last email?

1536
01:30:10,784 --> 01:30:11,264
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's it.

1537
01:30:11,504 --> 01:30:13,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

1538
01:30:13,305 --> 01:30:16,486
[SPEAKER_16]: We're running, wow, we're about an hour and a half into this, but we're going to take some more calls.

1539
01:30:17,364 --> 01:30:18,185
[SPEAKER_16]: And keep on going.

1540
01:30:18,605 --> 01:30:19,225
[SPEAKER_16]: So here we go.

1541
01:30:19,325 --> 01:30:21,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Back to the phones.

1542
01:30:21,447 --> 01:30:24,869
[SPEAKER_16]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype.

1543
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:26,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1544
01:30:26,851 --> 01:30:27,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

1545
01:30:28,232 --> 01:30:28,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.

1546
01:30:28,672 --> 01:30:29,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

1547
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:30,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we can.

1548
01:30:30,033 --> 01:30:30,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is this?

1549
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:32,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

1550
01:30:32,355 --> 01:30:33,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.

1551
01:30:33,456 --> 01:30:34,036
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

1552
01:30:34,917 --> 01:30:35,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not much.

1553
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:41,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really wanted to call and say happy to hear you guys got 500 episodes.

1554
01:30:41,761 --> 01:30:42,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.

1555
01:30:42,762 --> 01:30:45,144
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually five years, not 500, but that's all right.

1556
01:30:46,535 --> 01:30:49,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still blitzed from today.

1557
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:51,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing a little drinking today?

1558
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:54,940
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was in the middle of the whole Pride thing.

1559
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:55,760
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nuts.

1560
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:01,643
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's strange that you're not the first person to make that 500 mistake, which is kind of strange.

1561
01:31:03,544 --> 01:31:06,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I don't feel so bad now.

1562
01:31:06,345 --> 01:31:06,866
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's cool.

1563
01:31:06,906 --> 01:31:07,346
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all good.

1564
01:31:08,406 --> 01:31:09,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about games.

1565
01:31:10,648 --> 01:31:11,888
[SPEAKER_16]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

1566
01:31:13,609 --> 01:31:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly DS stuff.

1567
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:17,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you a big fan of handhelds?

1568
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:25,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're easy for me to get into and easy for me to take on the go since I'm constantly in one place to another place to another place.

1569
01:31:26,764 --> 01:31:29,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's something big that's happened in the past five years.

1570
01:31:29,466 --> 01:31:36,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember when the DS was first announced and a lot of people were like, that's kind of weird that you're going to be using the touchscreen.

1571
01:31:36,569 --> 01:31:41,051
[SPEAKER_16]: And now the system is monstrously successful, the Nintendo DS.

1572
01:31:41,531 --> 01:31:44,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do you think Nintendo has had such success with the DS?

1573
01:31:46,073 --> 01:31:50,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were forced to actually make games instead of just rehashing some stuff, one.

1574
01:31:50,978 --> 01:32:05,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, they actually took advantage of the originality of just using touchscreen, rather than just saying, okay, here's a portable system, let's just bring some games from the other systems and just water it down for the portables.

1575
01:32:06,849 --> 01:32:07,971
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1576
01:32:21,162 --> 01:32:22,863
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, I actually really agree with that comment.

1577
01:32:22,883 --> 01:32:27,145
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's why the DS has been successful, is that really the only thing you can do on it is games.

1578
01:32:27,465 --> 01:32:32,648
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, granted, now they have the Opera browser and all that stuff, but let's face it, all that crap was an afterthought.

1579
01:32:33,068 --> 01:32:34,949
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, you know, really a game system first.

1580
01:32:35,009 --> 01:32:42,032
[SPEAKER_16]: And not to knock the PSP, because I know a lot of folks listen to this show on the PSP, and that's actually why the PSP is pretty awesome.

1581
01:32:42,453 --> 01:32:43,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's like...

1582
01:32:44,093 --> 01:32:47,594
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the red mage of portable gaming is what the PSP is.

1583
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:51,255
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little bit of everything, but it's not really strong at anything.

1584
01:32:51,575 --> 01:32:52,955
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little bit iPod.

1585
01:32:53,355 --> 01:32:54,956
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little bit web browser.

1586
01:32:55,356 --> 01:32:56,576
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little bit gaming.

1587
01:32:56,996 --> 01:32:58,297
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little bit this and that.

1588
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:02,438
[SPEAKER_16]: But it doesn't really 100% excel at any of it.

1589
01:33:02,518 --> 01:33:03,978
[SPEAKER_16]: But that doesn't necessarily make it bad.

1590
01:33:04,318 --> 01:33:04,978
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a red mage.

1591
01:33:05,498 --> 01:33:07,679
[SPEAKER_16]: That's quite possibly the best comparison I could make.

1592
01:33:08,697 --> 01:33:11,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you also get the PSP has a lot shorter battery life.

1593
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:13,441
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does a little bit of a battery life.

1594
01:33:13,901 --> 01:33:14,342
[SPEAKER_16]: That's true.

1595
01:33:14,562 --> 01:33:15,383
[SPEAKER_16]: But don't get me wrong.

1596
01:33:15,403 --> 01:33:16,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I love my PSP.

1597
01:33:16,323 --> 01:33:17,284
[SPEAKER_34]: Try playing a Nomad.

1598
01:33:18,245 --> 01:33:23,469
[SPEAKER_16]: And movies look so sharp on the PSP and so do websites.

1599
01:33:23,489 --> 01:33:25,531
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I love that little screen on the PSP.

1600
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:27,353
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish the DS had something that sharp.

1601
01:33:29,314 --> 01:33:29,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with.

1602
01:33:30,515 --> 01:33:31,016
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with.

1603
01:33:31,616 --> 01:33:34,779
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did play one other game that wasn't a handheld.

1604
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:36,120
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

1605
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtua Fighter 5 on the PS3.

1606
01:33:39,741 --> 01:33:40,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, now how was that?

1607
01:33:42,442 --> 01:33:46,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm the only fan of the Virtua Fighter series because I was in love with it.

1608
01:33:48,744 --> 01:33:50,145
[SPEAKER_16]: So you totally love the game?

1609
01:33:51,385 --> 01:33:52,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I love the series.

1610
01:33:53,426 --> 01:33:53,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah.

1611
01:33:54,102 --> 01:33:57,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know, I don't know, DarkSakura, weren't you a bit of a Virtua Fighter fan, at least in the beginning?

1612
01:33:57,983 --> 01:33:58,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Never.

1613
01:33:58,824 --> 01:33:59,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

1614
01:33:59,024 --> 01:33:59,904
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate Virtua Fighter.

1615
01:33:59,924 --> 01:34:01,325
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought you did like it.

1616
01:34:01,885 --> 01:34:03,005
[SPEAKER_34]: No, Dan loves Virtua Fighter.

1617
01:34:03,426 --> 01:34:04,846
[SPEAKER_34]: I personally thought the game was shit.

1618
01:34:05,146 --> 01:34:07,167
[SPEAKER_16]: I just made you assume that because you're a Sega fangirl.

1619
01:34:07,187 --> 01:34:12,309
[SPEAKER_34]: The only time I played any Virtua Fighter for any amount of time was playing Virtua Fighter 2 to try to knock off Kage's mask.

1620
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:16,550
[SPEAKER_34]: And people know what I'm talking about.

1621
01:34:17,211 --> 01:34:17,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1622
01:34:19,672 --> 01:34:22,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I enjoyed the fifth one, and I actually also got to play on...

1623
01:34:23,795 --> 01:34:25,216
[SPEAKER_01]: on a high-definition projector.

1624
01:34:25,716 --> 01:34:26,056
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh.

1625
01:34:27,216 --> 01:34:29,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

1626
01:34:29,317 --> 01:34:33,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even play for like five minutes just watching it.

1627
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:39,421
[SPEAKER_16]: TheRobD says, I was more obsessed with knocking off Blue Mary's shirt in Real Bout 2.

1628
01:34:41,062 --> 01:34:42,423
[SPEAKER_16]: It's always the nudity with you people.

1629
01:34:42,923 --> 01:34:44,343
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I'll say this.

1630
01:34:44,543 --> 01:34:45,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you played Xbox 360?

1631
01:34:46,384 --> 01:34:46,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Never?

1632
01:34:47,144 --> 01:34:48,165
[SPEAKER_16]: A few times, actually, yes.

1633
01:34:48,325 --> 01:34:49,926
[SPEAKER_16]: So what do you think graphics-wise?

1634
01:34:49,946 --> 01:34:52,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think a game like Virtua Fighter will look as good on the 360?

1635
01:34:54,945 --> 01:34:56,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it probably would work.

1636
01:34:56,406 --> 01:34:57,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it probably would look good.

1637
01:34:58,347 --> 01:35:06,772
[SPEAKER_01]: My only concern about the series is that as long as it moves just the same, just as smooth, because that's a game where it's a true Twitch fest.

1638
01:35:06,992 --> 01:35:08,373
[SPEAKER_01]: One frame and you're dead.

1639
01:35:09,272 --> 01:35:09,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Hmm, good point.

1640
01:35:10,213 --> 01:35:25,962
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason why I ask that, not that I'm, like, you know, dumb or anything, I just, you know, because sometimes people say, well, the PS3 has the true HD built in and all this, so I'm just kind of, you know, curious, like, you know, they kind of insinuate that it has a graphical edge on Xbox 360, so I'm just kind of curious if anyone ever notices it.

1641
01:35:26,703 --> 01:35:26,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Ever.

1642
01:35:27,763 --> 01:35:35,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would, but I think, honestly, the best way for me, to me, would actually get both of them side by side in a way and see how they look.

1643
01:35:35,808 --> 01:35:36,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1644
01:35:36,529 --> 01:35:36,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Well...

1645
01:35:37,219 --> 01:35:39,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, DDR Dollar Bill, we gotta let you go to take some more calls.

1646
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:40,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Any last minute thoughts?

1647
01:35:41,581 --> 01:35:42,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I don't have a podcast.

1648
01:35:43,782 --> 01:35:44,162
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

1649
01:35:44,522 --> 01:35:45,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, well then nothing to plug.

1650
01:35:45,903 --> 01:35:47,064
[SPEAKER_16]: So, well, that's cool.

1651
01:35:47,144 --> 01:35:48,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe you'll start one someday.

1652
01:35:49,145 --> 01:35:49,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, I doubt it.

1653
01:35:49,845 --> 01:35:50,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too busy.

1654
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:51,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, well, fair enough.

1655
01:35:51,766 --> 01:35:53,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you for choosing ours to listen to.

1656
01:35:53,306 --> 01:35:53,907
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

1657
01:35:54,407 --> 01:35:54,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, guys.

1658
01:35:55,027 --> 01:35:55,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.

1659
01:35:57,248 --> 01:35:58,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Jamie, you get this call.

1660
01:35:59,409 --> 01:36:01,150
[SPEAKER_16]: This one is your turn.

1661
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:02,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold on, I haven't picked it up yet.

1662
01:36:02,531 --> 01:36:02,931
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, okay.

1663
01:36:06,361 --> 01:36:07,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Skype's being annoying.

1664
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:08,942
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

1665
01:36:10,003 --> 01:36:10,403
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

1666
01:36:10,943 --> 01:36:11,503
[SPEAKER_34]: Who's this?

1667
01:36:12,543 --> 01:36:13,144
[SPEAKER_34]: It's Roz.

1668
01:36:13,724 --> 01:36:14,364
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi!

1669
01:36:15,565 --> 01:36:16,165
[SPEAKER_34]: It's Roz!

1670
01:36:16,845 --> 01:36:18,446
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh my god, hi!

1671
01:36:19,586 --> 01:36:19,966
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

1672
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:22,127
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind, Roz?

1673
01:36:23,708 --> 01:36:26,509
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I mostly wanted to talk to Jamie.

1674
01:36:27,149 --> 01:36:28,810
[SPEAKER_16]: OMG, a girl called in.

1675
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:31,131
[SPEAKER_16]: OMG, a girl, a real life girl.

1676
01:36:33,832 --> 01:36:34,772
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you want to say to Jamie?

1677
01:36:36,367 --> 01:36:38,989
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to say I'm so sorry for disappearing.

1678
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:40,410
[SPEAKER_34]: That's okay.

1679
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:41,411
[SPEAKER_34]: I forgive you, I think.

1680
01:36:42,471 --> 01:36:43,252
[SPEAKER_35]: I do it all the time.

1681
01:36:43,272 --> 01:36:45,393
[SPEAKER_34]: You have to make up for it with bleached zombie butts.

1682
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:47,835
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1683
01:36:47,895 --> 01:36:50,457
[SPEAKER_16]: What are you turning our fifth anniversary show into, you two?

1684
01:36:50,637 --> 01:36:51,498
[SPEAKER_34]: It's an in-joke.

1685
01:36:51,638 --> 01:36:52,478
[SPEAKER_34]: I see that.

1686
01:36:52,919 --> 01:36:56,081
[SPEAKER_34]: It's on the other site that I hang out on, Gorillas Unofficial.

1687
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:56,861
[SPEAKER_34]: Ah, I get you.

1688
01:36:58,776 --> 01:37:02,398
[SPEAKER_34]: You remember when we were all in studio playing with that word rearranger thing?

1689
01:37:02,798 --> 01:37:03,499
[SPEAKER_34]: In the chat here.

1690
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:09,102
[SPEAKER_34]: And she made one that said, Orange Lounge Radio owns everything including bleached zombie butts.

1691
01:37:09,142 --> 01:37:09,502
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember that.

1692
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:12,064
[SPEAKER_16]: It was one of those fridge magnet site things where you can make your own stuff.

1693
01:37:12,084 --> 01:37:14,806
[SPEAKER_34]: That's part of my signature on Gorillas Unofficial.

1694
01:37:14,926 --> 01:37:15,486
[SPEAKER_34]: Good times.

1695
01:37:16,267 --> 01:37:16,687
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

1696
01:37:17,588 --> 01:37:18,828
[SPEAKER_34]: I totally stole it from Roz.

1697
01:37:19,609 --> 01:37:21,570
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah, except I disappeared from there, too.

1698
01:37:22,091 --> 01:37:23,571
[SPEAKER_34]: I noticed that, too, Missy.

1699
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:25,653
[SPEAKER_34]: So you're going to hang out more, right?

1700
01:37:26,923 --> 01:37:28,444
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, you've been busy with school, though, right?

1701
01:37:30,585 --> 01:37:31,065
[SPEAKER_35]: Not really.

1702
01:37:31,085 --> 01:37:33,706
[SPEAKER_35]: Actually, I've been busy with medical problems.

1703
01:37:34,206 --> 01:37:35,067
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, sorry to hear that.

1704
01:37:36,467 --> 01:37:37,888
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, it's not any different from usual.

1705
01:37:37,928 --> 01:37:39,069
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm pretty much used to it.

1706
01:37:40,409 --> 01:37:41,950
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, you shouldn't have to be used to that.

1707
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:44,011
[SPEAKER_34]: It happens.

1708
01:37:44,371 --> 01:37:45,752
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

1709
01:37:45,872 --> 01:37:46,652
[SPEAKER_34]: I can sympathize.

1710
01:37:46,712 --> 01:37:47,953
[SPEAKER_34]: I had my problems last year.

1711
01:37:49,293 --> 01:37:49,834
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, yeah.

1712
01:37:50,834 --> 01:37:52,155
[SPEAKER_34]: I have drugs for that now.

1713
01:37:52,175 --> 01:37:52,275
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

1714
01:37:53,709 --> 01:37:57,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Luckily, the video game addiction thing didn't go through or I might have a medical problem as well.

1715
01:37:58,213 --> 01:37:59,214
[SPEAKER_34]: I've got a medical problem.

1716
01:37:59,234 --> 01:38:03,358
[SPEAKER_34]: It's called Rob-itis, which would technically mean inflammation of the Rob.

1717
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:03,418
[SPEAKER_34]: Ew.

1718
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,741
[SPEAKER_34]: Rob, are you inflamed?

1719
01:38:08,542 --> 01:38:10,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Girl, are you trying to say I'm flaming?

1720
01:38:10,804 --> 01:38:13,447
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what you're trying to say, girl, but you're making me mad.

1721
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:17,891
[SPEAKER_34]: Rob's inflamed.

1722
01:38:18,797 --> 01:38:19,738
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh my.

1723
01:38:19,758 --> 01:38:19,958
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh my.

1724
01:38:19,978 --> 01:38:20,098
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh my.

1725
01:38:20,118 --> 01:38:20,478
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh my.

1726
01:38:49,778 --> 01:38:53,040
[SPEAKER_35]: and happy little anniversary, Chindig.

1727
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:58,422
[SPEAKER_35]: I thought I'd, you know, get back to the planet to join you for this.

1728
01:38:58,842 --> 01:39:00,143
[SPEAKER_34]: Ground control to Major Tom.

1729
01:39:01,964 --> 01:39:02,664
[SPEAKER_34]: Something like that.

1730
01:39:03,084 --> 01:39:05,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we appreciate you and you're a very down-to-earth phone call.

1731
01:39:06,026 --> 01:39:06,986
[SPEAKER_16]: We really appreciate that.

1732
01:39:07,126 --> 01:39:08,267
[SPEAKER_34]: Thanks for calling, Roz.

1733
01:39:08,287 --> 01:39:08,927
[SPEAKER_34]: We missed you.

1734
01:39:09,807 --> 01:39:10,368
[SPEAKER_35]: I know you did.

1735
01:39:10,388 --> 01:39:11,668
[SPEAKER_34]: But my aim's improving.

1736
01:39:12,689 --> 01:39:13,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye, Roz.

1737
01:39:13,689 --> 01:39:14,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

1738
01:39:14,309 --> 01:39:14,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

1739
01:39:15,130 --> 01:39:15,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

1740
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,551
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice to hear from a girl.

1741
01:39:18,407 --> 01:39:19,588
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1742
01:39:48,137 --> 01:39:49,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, this is Orange Lines Radio.

1743
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:51,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is this?

1744
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:51,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

1745
01:39:51,741 --> 01:39:52,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

1746
01:39:52,802 --> 01:39:53,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, it's Shaveymon.

1747
01:39:53,963 --> 01:39:54,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, how's it going?

1748
01:39:55,224 --> 01:39:55,724
Hi!

1749
01:39:56,025 --> 01:39:56,305
[SPEAKER_08]: You?

1750
01:39:57,406 --> 01:39:58,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually got through.

1751
01:39:58,227 --> 01:39:59,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think this would ever happen.

1752
01:40:00,389 --> 01:40:01,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question's for Rob.

1753
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:02,631
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, sir.

1754
01:40:04,433 --> 01:40:06,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Would Flaming Finger ever work on the DS?

1755
01:40:08,397 --> 01:40:12,801
[SPEAKER_16]: Only if it has a soundtrack with the quality of the original Flaming Finger.

1756
01:40:13,476 --> 01:40:20,525
[SPEAKER_16]: For those that have never played Flaming Finger, because I have to give background now, Flaming Finger is one of those ticket-spitter games, and I've only seen them ever in two places.

1757
01:40:21,005 --> 01:40:27,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave & Buster's, just about every Dave & Buster's I've ever walked into has one of these machines, and randomly Sunnyvale Golf Land had one.

1758
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:38,925
[SPEAKER_16]: and you basically, you use your finger to navigate through this maze and the game totally cheats because as you get like three-fourths of the way through the maze, the clock starts counting down much faster.

1759
01:40:39,386 --> 01:40:42,207
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's got this very distinctive rave beat to the game.

1760
01:40:42,928 --> 01:40:44,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Flaming finger!

1761
01:40:44,209 --> 01:40:46,930
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, you know, all the homosexual jokes you can make with it.

1762
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:49,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Tee hee gay, tee hee flaming, ha ha ha.

1763
01:40:49,692 --> 01:40:50,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Get your flame on.

1764
01:40:50,632 --> 01:40:51,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Get your flame on!

1765
01:40:54,523 --> 01:40:58,945
[SPEAKER_08]: and, uh, yeah, I kind of froze up and don't know what to say now.

1766
01:40:58,965 --> 01:40:59,405
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it?

1767
01:40:59,485 --> 01:41:00,325
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all you wanted to say?

1768
01:41:00,765 --> 01:41:02,305
[SPEAKER_16]: You wanted to ask if I gave my phone?

1769
01:41:02,446 --> 01:41:03,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been trying to get through all night and I finally did.

1770
01:41:04,446 --> 01:41:08,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to ask if I enjoy Flaming Finger or if it should come out on the DS.

1771
01:41:08,907 --> 01:41:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I also wanted to congratulate you guys for five years.

1772
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:13,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1773
01:41:13,488 --> 01:41:15,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember listening to the first episode and, uh,

1774
01:41:15,745 --> 01:41:17,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a complete douchebag back then.

1775
01:41:17,145 --> 01:41:21,266
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys actually banned me from the chat room.

1776
01:41:21,547 --> 01:41:24,247
[SPEAKER_16]: We banned JVmon from chat during the first episode.

1777
01:41:24,627 --> 01:41:25,368
[SPEAKER_16]: That's amazing.

1778
01:41:25,388 --> 01:41:26,808
[SPEAKER_34]: He's since proven himself.

1779
01:41:27,448 --> 01:41:27,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1780
01:41:28,108 --> 01:41:29,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Rehab works.

1781
01:41:30,109 --> 01:41:31,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1782
01:41:31,929 --> 01:41:32,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Crying and moaning.

1783
01:41:32,609 --> 01:41:33,350
[SPEAKER_08]: OLR rehab.

1784
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:39,431
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about that, but I'd also like to thank Jamie for introducing me to Doctor Who, my new form of crack.

1785
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:40,291
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

1786
01:41:40,892 --> 01:41:42,172
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm getting people addicted.

1787
01:41:43,169 --> 01:41:46,572
[SPEAKER_34]: He's also one of the people I talk to every day online, too, now.

1788
01:41:47,313 --> 01:41:48,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Jamie's my new online BFF.

1789
01:41:52,538 --> 01:41:54,780
[SPEAKER_16]: And thanks for lunch in New York City, Jamie Mon.

1790
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,681
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that.

1791
01:41:55,941 --> 01:41:57,903
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wasn't the one that banned you from chat, was I?

1792
01:41:59,244 --> 01:42:00,065
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think it was Jamie.

1793
01:42:00,225 --> 01:42:00,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

1794
01:42:00,705 --> 01:42:01,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know she does that.

1795
01:42:01,646 --> 01:42:03,388
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, I do that all the time.

1796
01:42:03,408 --> 01:42:04,869
[SPEAKER_08]: With her enormous panhammer.

1797
01:42:06,889 --> 01:42:09,352
[SPEAKER_16]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1798
01:42:25,638 --> 01:42:27,519
[SPEAKER_16]: for us in gaming in the past five years.

1799
01:42:27,559 --> 01:42:30,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, you know how, like, you know, especially five years ago, he signed on to Xbox Live.

1800
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:34,503
[SPEAKER_16]: It's fag, fag, fag, fag, you know, gay, gay, that's gay.

1801
01:42:34,823 --> 01:42:36,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think there's been any progress?

1802
01:42:36,884 --> 01:42:43,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, I noticed the visibility of, like, you know, the gaygamer.net and, like, a lot of those, like, gay gaming communities.

1803
01:42:43,687 --> 01:42:49,670
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like there's an awful lot more people out there now that will admit they're gay in the gaming scene than there used to be.

1804
01:42:49,710 --> 01:42:51,171
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it's just me, but what do you think?

1805
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:54,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that over time has passed.

1806
01:42:54,109 --> 01:42:58,934
[SPEAKER_08]: People have just been more accepting about it because it can't hide it anymore.

1807
01:42:59,014 --> 01:43:00,395
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just there and it's out there.

1808
01:43:00,736 --> 01:43:02,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It's either you got with the times or you just got left behind.

1809
01:43:03,138 --> 01:43:07,342
[SPEAKER_16]: So in other words, if you put it on your MySpace profile somewhere, somebody is going to find it and they know.

1810
01:43:07,362 --> 01:43:08,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much.

1811
01:43:08,664 --> 01:43:11,287
[SPEAKER_08]: If you put it on MySpace, it's on the Internet.

1812
01:43:11,307 --> 01:43:12,748
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like trying to get pee out of a pool.

1813
01:43:12,948 --> 01:43:13,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you –

1814
01:43:17,577 --> 01:43:27,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you think that it might be a mirror of society where maybe there's been a more general acceptance of gay lifestyle and gay culture in society?

1815
01:43:28,116 --> 01:43:28,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1816
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,067
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1817
01:43:55,194 --> 01:43:57,335
[SPEAKER_16]: and it's because of those shows on TV like Queer Eye.

1818
01:43:57,355 --> 01:44:00,457
[SPEAKER_16]: So even though not my kind of show, like, you know, it just kind of gives visibility.

1819
01:44:00,577 --> 01:44:01,218
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know.

1820
01:44:02,038 --> 01:44:03,839
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess we're talking about something a lot bigger than gaming.

1821
01:44:03,879 --> 01:44:05,000
[SPEAKER_16]: So I should probably hang up on you now.

1822
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:06,721
[SPEAKER_08]: If only if you want.

1823
01:44:06,961 --> 01:44:08,382
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1824
01:44:09,423 --> 01:44:09,683
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1825
01:44:09,903 --> 01:44:11,404
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, take care, JV Mon.

1826
01:44:11,544 --> 01:44:13,845
[SPEAKER_16]: And and yeah, thanks for calling.

1827
01:44:14,346 --> 01:44:16,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And next week for me, like two weeks.

1828
01:44:16,707 --> 01:44:17,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweet.

1829
01:44:17,067 --> 01:44:17,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I love CDs.

1830
01:44:18,788 --> 01:44:18,968
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1831
01:44:18,988 --> 01:44:21,550
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll let you have more important.

1832
01:44:22,136 --> 01:44:22,356
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1833
01:44:23,057 --> 01:44:24,538
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just more calls, JV Ma.

1834
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:26,339
[SPEAKER_16]: No one call is more important than the other.

1835
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:27,300
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1836
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:27,800
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1837
01:44:27,940 --> 01:44:28,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

1838
01:44:28,801 --> 01:44:29,081
[SPEAKER_16]: You too.

1839
01:44:29,221 --> 01:44:29,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

1840
01:44:29,382 --> 01:44:29,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

1841
01:44:30,482 --> 01:44:34,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Now we have people in chat that are like, I'm in choir.

1842
01:44:34,926 --> 01:44:35,366
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not gay.

1843
01:44:35,446 --> 01:44:36,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't say all.

1844
01:44:37,027 --> 01:44:38,829
[SPEAKER_16]: I just said a lot.

1845
01:44:38,909 --> 01:44:42,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Not even a lot, but you have to admit that there – I don't know.

1846
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:47,495
[SPEAKER_16]: At least when I was in high school, like at least half the guys in choir were a little bit fruity.

1847
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:49,497
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe it's – I would think it's still that way today.

1848
01:44:49,517 --> 01:44:50,778
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not saying they all are.

1849
01:44:51,567 --> 01:44:52,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Back off.

1850
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:53,848
[SPEAKER_16]: God, now we're going to get emails and everything, too.

1851
01:44:55,348 --> 01:44:56,628
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, weren't you in choir?

1852
01:44:58,389 --> 01:45:02,750
[SPEAKER_34]: I was until they made me sing with the boys because I had a low voice.

1853
01:45:03,110 --> 01:45:04,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Gay boys or straight boys?

1854
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:06,571
[SPEAKER_34]: This was church.

1855
01:45:07,491 --> 01:45:08,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, never mind.

1856
01:45:08,391 --> 01:45:08,931
[SPEAKER_16]: That's different.

1857
01:45:08,951 --> 01:45:11,872
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, no, I did chorus for two weeks, but I was supposed to be in band.

1858
01:45:11,912 --> 01:45:13,832
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a whole other can of worms.

1859
01:45:13,852 --> 01:45:14,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know.

1860
01:45:14,452 --> 01:45:14,733
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1861
01:45:15,313 --> 01:45:16,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to another call.

1862
01:45:17,393 --> 01:45:18,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1863
01:45:18,533 --> 01:45:18,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

1864
01:45:19,514 --> 01:45:20,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is FLorex.

1865
01:45:21,335 --> 01:45:22,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, BlackDevilerX.

1866
01:45:22,056 --> 01:45:22,816
[SPEAKER_16]: You're a little bit quiet.

1867
01:45:22,876 --> 01:45:23,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Make sure you're talking right in the mic.

1868
01:45:23,997 --> 01:45:24,437
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

1869
01:45:24,457 --> 01:45:25,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much.

1870
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, I'm hearing a ringing in the background, but that's okay.

1871
01:45:30,821 --> 01:45:32,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that.

1872
01:45:32,782 --> 01:45:33,183
[SPEAKER_16]: That's weird.

1873
01:45:33,203 --> 01:45:33,783
[SPEAKER_16]: We hear it, too.

1874
01:45:33,843 --> 01:45:34,283
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay.

1875
01:45:34,303 --> 01:45:34,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep trying.

1876
01:45:34,924 --> 01:45:35,444
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

1877
01:45:38,626 --> 01:45:45,991
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you called in last week, or if you remember I called in a couple weeks ago, and I was trying to get a Wii, and I finally got one.

1878
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,990
[SPEAKER_16]: You finally got a weed?

1879
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:52,311
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds like someone's drinking a Slurpee over there or something, doesn't it?

1880
01:45:52,371 --> 01:45:55,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't figure that... I'm sorry, I'm playing with something else here, I'll pump it away.

1881
01:45:56,192 --> 01:46:00,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, that's why we hear... I swear to God, it's like we hear a Slurpee or in the background or something, or like a bong.

1882
01:46:00,553 --> 01:46:01,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you smoking weed?

1883
01:46:01,913 --> 01:46:03,313
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I am not smoking weed.

1884
01:46:03,373 --> 01:46:03,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, okay.

1885
01:46:04,054 --> 01:46:05,054
[SPEAKER_34]: Are you smoking crack?

1886
01:46:05,274 --> 01:46:06,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1887
01:46:06,354 --> 01:46:06,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh.

1888
01:46:07,374 --> 01:46:08,134
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just kidding.

1889
01:46:08,194 --> 01:46:09,955
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't smoke crack in a bong.

1890
01:46:09,975 --> 01:46:10,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

1891
01:46:12,815 --> 01:46:13,415
[SPEAKER_16]: Not that I'd know.

1892
01:46:14,816 --> 01:46:15,976
[SPEAKER_16]: So you finally got a Wii.

1893
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:16,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I did.

1894
01:46:17,117 --> 01:46:17,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

1895
01:46:17,997 --> 01:46:18,997
[SPEAKER_16]: How did you manage to do it?

1896
01:46:19,578 --> 01:46:27,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had to buy it in a bundle with two other games and another Wii remote.

1897
01:46:28,942 --> 01:46:30,282
[SPEAKER_16]: And where did you get this bundle at?

1898
01:46:31,263 --> 01:46:33,224
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this bundle at the Virgin Mega Store.

1899
01:46:34,084 --> 01:46:35,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, so a forced bundle.

1900
01:46:35,685 --> 01:46:37,426
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you think about forced bundles?

1901
01:46:37,666 --> 01:46:38,526
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like them.

1902
01:46:39,146 --> 01:46:40,267
[SPEAKER_16]: But you bought one anyway.

1903
01:46:41,007 --> 01:46:42,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really don't like them.

1904
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:44,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when the game selections suck.

1905
01:47:00,821 --> 01:47:06,705
[SPEAKER_16]: You probably can't hear it on your end, but we keep hearing this little... It's like a slurpee or a ring or something every two seconds.

1906
01:47:06,806 --> 01:47:07,406
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so funny.

1907
01:47:07,967 --> 01:47:10,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, so are you happy now that you got a Wii?

1908
01:47:10,629 --> 01:47:11,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you actually been playing it?

1909
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:12,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1910
01:47:12,971 --> 01:47:19,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got... Well, the two games that I had to get were Marvel Ultimate Alliance and Spider-Man 3.

1911
01:47:20,457 --> 01:47:20,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1912
01:47:21,798 --> 01:47:24,600
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't opt for Zelda or Trauma Center or any of that stuff?

1913
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:25,521
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have Zelda.

1914
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:26,502
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have Trauma Center.

1915
01:47:26,842 --> 01:47:28,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, their game selection just sucked.

1916
01:47:31,466 --> 01:47:32,406
[SPEAKER_00]: They had Cooking Mama.

1917
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:36,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Cooking Mama's a little bit better on the DS than it is on the Wii, to be honest.

1918
01:47:39,127 --> 01:47:54,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the main thing I wanted to do tonight while I was calling in was back when I was listening, I think a couple of years ago before I had kind of the Sunday night commitment and I dropped out and I'm sorry, was to open a pint of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.

1919
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:59,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am opening a pint of

1920
01:47:59,818 --> 01:48:02,959
[SPEAKER_00]: of Chocolate Cookie Dough Ice Cream in your honor.

1921
01:48:02,999 --> 01:48:03,979
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like my little toast.

1922
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:05,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

1923
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:05,860
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

1924
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:10,221
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm clanking my empty champagne glass to your cookie dough ice cream.

1925
01:48:11,121 --> 01:48:11,541
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

1926
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:15,543
[SPEAKER_34]: My stomach is digesting in honor of your ice cream.

1927
01:48:15,663 --> 01:48:15,963
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1928
01:48:17,063 --> 01:48:18,183
[SPEAKER_16]: We got to let you go, buddy.

1929
01:48:18,203 --> 01:48:19,464
[SPEAKER_16]: That ringing is driving me nuts.

1930
01:48:19,684 --> 01:48:23,965
[SPEAKER_16]: But thank you very much for the call and listen to the playback on the podcast because it's hilarious.

1931
01:48:24,765 --> 01:48:25,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Banana phone.

1932
01:48:25,826 --> 01:48:26,066
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

1933
01:48:26,326 --> 01:48:26,626
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

1934
01:48:31,455 --> 01:48:34,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, this is Jonathan Fields, how you doing?

1935
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:34,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, who?

1936
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:47,040
[SPEAKER_09]: John Fields.

1937
01:48:47,321 --> 01:48:47,881
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, hi!

1938
01:48:48,361 --> 01:48:50,222
[SPEAKER_34]: You were on the show like a long-ass time ago.

1939
01:48:50,302 --> 01:48:54,665
[SPEAKER_16]: He's the guy that flew out here like all the way from like, what, Connecticut you're at?

1940
01:48:54,785 --> 01:48:55,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Connecticut.

1941
01:48:55,685 --> 01:48:56,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in New Jersey now.

1942
01:48:57,086 --> 01:48:57,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

1943
01:48:57,406 --> 01:48:59,788
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was there back when Tech TV was still around.

1944
01:49:00,028 --> 01:49:00,848
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember that.

1945
01:49:00,908 --> 01:49:02,329
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember you came to the show.

1946
01:49:02,349 --> 01:49:03,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you remember what episode number that was?

1947
01:49:04,651 --> 01:49:11,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember off the top of my head, but it was like the year before G4 bought him out.

1948
01:49:12,535 --> 01:49:14,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so it was probably in the low 100s, right?

1949
01:49:14,877 --> 01:49:15,557
[SPEAKER_16]: About the time you were there?

1950
01:49:15,577 --> 01:49:15,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1951
01:49:16,405 --> 01:49:17,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe 4.69, I'm trying to remember.

1952
01:49:17,686 --> 01:49:18,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, everything's changed.

1953
01:49:18,427 --> 01:49:20,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, your format has changed.

1954
01:49:20,088 --> 01:49:23,311
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, Megas has changed his name, all that sort of stuff.

1955
01:49:23,331 --> 01:49:23,391
[SPEAKER_16]: And...

1956
01:49:44,235 --> 01:49:52,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be totally honest, you guys are lucky that the anniversary is happening today and not yesterday, because otherwise you'd be facing against a big hedgehog.

1957
01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:54,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, what's yesterday?

1958
01:49:55,301 --> 01:49:55,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Sonic's birthday.

1959
01:49:57,622 --> 01:50:04,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you know, technically the show started on June 23rd, so yesterday was our birthday, but we celebrate it tonight because it's Sunday.

1960
01:50:05,687 --> 01:50:06,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

1961
01:50:07,448 --> 01:50:08,028
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you go.

1962
01:50:10,029 --> 01:50:11,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering, actually, Rob.

1963
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:11,610
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1964
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:16,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you ever watch any of the big gaming cartoons way, way back in the 80s?

1965
01:50:17,454 --> 01:50:19,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I watched the Super Mario Bros.

1966
01:50:19,075 --> 01:50:24,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Super Show religiously every day after school and would also watch the Zelda cartoon on Fridays.

1967
01:50:24,839 --> 01:50:25,579
[SPEAKER_16]: That was my show.

1968
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,981
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't really watch Captain Anne or any of the other ones, but that was the one.

1969
01:50:29,962 --> 01:50:31,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that stuff is on DVD now?

1970
01:50:31,803 --> 01:50:33,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I have the second season on DVD.

1971
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:34,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I need to find the first.

1972
01:50:35,424 --> 01:50:36,786
[SPEAKER_09]: You can probably find it on Amazon.

1973
01:50:37,086 --> 01:50:38,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I really need to get the Zelda DVD too.

1974
01:50:38,808 --> 01:50:40,050
[SPEAKER_16]: For some reason I just never bought it.

1975
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:44,035
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been busy watching all these other shows but I definitely want the Zelda DVD package as well.

1976
01:50:44,659 --> 01:50:50,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep seeing that one every time I go on Amazon, so they keep recommending it to me, so you can probably find it easy.

1977
01:50:51,503 --> 01:50:57,927
[SPEAKER_16]: You kind of brought up the whole tech TV thing, and you've been talking a lot about television.

1978
01:50:57,947 --> 01:51:00,469
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm kind of curious, because it's funny, a lot has changed there.

1979
01:51:00,869 --> 01:51:06,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell us really quick again, what would you say some of your experiences at the tech TV studios when you went?

1980
01:51:06,613 --> 01:51:07,954
[SPEAKER_16]: What kind of stuff did you observe?

1981
01:51:08,294 --> 01:51:10,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Did people seem to be enjoying themselves?

1982
01:51:10,876 --> 01:51:13,037
[SPEAKER_16]: How was the tour when you went?

1983
01:51:13,914 --> 01:51:21,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically what it was like was I basically went into the headquarters where the main shows were developed there.

1984
01:51:22,997 --> 01:51:24,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to meet Adam Sessler.

1985
01:51:26,658 --> 01:51:32,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I pretty much walked around where everybody's office space was, and I've still got a few Tech TV swag stuff.

1986
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:34,641
[SPEAKER_16]: That's pretty rad, man.

1987
01:51:34,741 --> 01:51:35,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are collector's things now.

1988
01:51:36,696 --> 01:51:37,076
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1989
01:51:37,337 --> 01:51:46,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And then after that, I took a little shuttle over to the studio, and I sat in on an episode of The Screensavers.

1990
01:51:47,144 --> 01:51:48,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, that's great.

1991
01:51:49,846 --> 01:51:50,407
[SPEAKER_16]: That's cool.

1992
01:51:50,527 --> 01:51:53,029
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's kind of sad now that that show's gone.

1993
01:51:53,229 --> 01:51:56,211
[SPEAKER_16]: My dad loved The Screensavers, too, and it was a really great show.

1994
01:51:56,251 --> 01:51:58,813
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just kind of sad to see what happened in the end to all that stuff.

1995
01:51:58,833 --> 01:52:01,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Leo and the gang, they're all still around.

1996
01:52:02,316 --> 01:52:05,658
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just doing a show now called This Week in Tech.

1997
01:52:05,798 --> 01:52:06,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1998
01:52:07,001 --> 01:52:09,684
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're in the podcasting biz, you know This Week in Tech.

1999
01:52:09,744 --> 01:52:10,164
[SPEAKER_16]: It's huge.

2000
01:52:10,184 --> 01:52:13,367
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a huge show.

2001
01:52:13,627 --> 01:52:16,370
[SPEAKER_09]: VO also has a KFI show in California.

2002
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:21,774
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad to see he's still kicking because, you know, folks like him are the kind of folks that inspire us.

2003
01:52:22,655 --> 01:52:23,216
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, and if...

2004
01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:26,620
[SPEAKER_09]: G4 hadn't brought out Tech TV, I'd probably be working there now.

2005
01:52:49,082 --> 01:52:51,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy 5th anniversary and a happy 5 more.

2006
01:52:51,643 --> 01:52:52,363
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all good.

2007
01:52:52,383 --> 01:52:53,103
[SPEAKER_16]: We know that things change.

2008
01:52:53,123 --> 01:52:53,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good one, buddy.

2009
01:52:53,564 --> 01:52:53,704
[SPEAKER_16]: You too.

2010
01:52:53,724 --> 01:52:53,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

2011
01:53:16,030 --> 01:53:21,895
[SPEAKER_16]: We've hit the two-hour mark, but of course that counts the bonus segment, which was a good ten minutes long, which the podcasters don't get to hear.

2012
01:53:21,915 --> 01:53:23,336
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to take a few more calls?

2013
01:53:24,337 --> 01:53:24,737
[SPEAKER_16]: A few more?

2014
01:53:25,057 --> 01:53:25,317
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay.

2015
01:53:25,578 --> 01:53:26,278
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's keep going.

2016
01:53:26,298 --> 01:53:27,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you guys okay on time and everything?

2017
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,621
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, I've only got to work overtime.

2018
01:53:29,921 --> 01:53:30,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2019
01:53:30,481 --> 01:53:31,062
[SPEAKER_34]: No, it's cool.

2020
01:53:31,142 --> 01:53:31,502
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm joking.

2021
01:53:31,963 --> 01:53:32,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight's a special night.

2022
01:53:33,023 --> 01:53:34,004
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Loki, your call.

2023
01:53:35,746 --> 01:53:36,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, who is this?

2024
01:53:38,908 --> 01:53:39,188
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello.

2025
01:53:39,428 --> 01:53:39,849
[SPEAKER_31]: Hello.

2026
01:53:40,249 --> 01:53:41,950
[SPEAKER_31]: This is Dr. Papatskou City.

2027
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:43,231
[SPEAKER_31]: How's it going?

2028
01:53:44,673 --> 01:53:45,133
[SPEAKER_31]: Just great.

2029
01:53:46,071 --> 01:53:46,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Hooray!

2030
01:53:46,552 --> 01:53:48,033
[SPEAKER_16]: More international listeners.

2031
01:53:48,113 --> 01:53:49,294
[SPEAKER_16]: We love hearing from the international folks.

2032
01:53:49,414 --> 01:53:53,137
[SPEAKER_31]: Let you know that I just love the show for the last year and a half.

2033
01:53:54,117 --> 01:53:55,318
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we really appreciate that.

2034
01:53:55,518 --> 01:53:58,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for listening to us for the past year and a half.

2035
01:53:58,621 --> 01:54:00,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Any highlights from our show?

2036
01:54:00,282 --> 01:54:02,924
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, actually what I do have is a question.

2037
01:54:04,805 --> 01:54:05,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, what's that?

2038
01:54:07,127 --> 01:54:08,108
[SPEAKER_31]: What's with the name?

2039
01:54:08,568 --> 01:54:11,791
[SPEAKER_31]: I assume you did have an orange lounge?

2040
01:54:13,032 --> 01:54:13,192
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2041
01:54:14,373 --> 01:54:14,713
[SPEAKER_31]: Where did that

2042
01:54:15,511 --> 01:54:15,911
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

2043
01:54:15,971 --> 01:54:27,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Very famous question we often get asked a lot, especially since we've started getting more listeners, since we moved into the general gaming chat, because anybody that played Mamani Games probably knows where the name comes from.

2044
01:54:27,938 --> 01:54:31,780
[SPEAKER_16]: But Jamie, I'll let you take this one, because you helped come up with the name.

2045
01:54:32,681 --> 01:54:34,001
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh, yeah, where we got our name from.

2046
01:54:35,482 --> 01:54:40,225
[SPEAKER_34]: We were on the train coming into San Francisco for something.

2047
01:54:40,665 --> 01:54:42,246
[SPEAKER_34]: We were going to the Metreon that day, right?

2048
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:52,695
[SPEAKER_34]: and we've been trying to think of all day a name for the station and when we came back, I was like, we should call it Orange Lounge Radio because it's Orange Lounge.

2049
01:54:53,672 --> 01:54:54,633
[SPEAKER_34]: Music, Radio

2050
01:55:21,918 --> 01:55:29,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're very thankful to Konami for not suing us for using the name, but I think they realized we gave them free advertising and still continue to do so for a long time.

2051
01:55:30,340 --> 01:55:32,841
[SPEAKER_16]: And Orange Lounge Radio is different from Orange Lounge, so there you go.

2052
01:55:33,761 --> 01:55:39,062
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, that just goes to show you that I have absolutely not a care for music games.

2053
01:55:39,402 --> 01:55:40,342
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all good.

2054
01:55:40,422 --> 01:55:42,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of our listeners don't, and that's just fine.

2055
01:55:42,763 --> 01:55:44,443
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, we try to...

2056
01:55:47,822 --> 01:55:49,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, Jamie was showing me a private message.

2057
01:55:49,803 --> 01:55:50,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't do that.

2058
01:55:50,283 --> 01:55:51,364
[SPEAKER_16]: You distract me during the show.

2059
01:55:51,384 --> 01:56:07,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, but it just goes to show, you know, we love, you know, the fact that since we have done the merge, even though not everybody was supportive when we kind of did away with talking about Bomani, only talking about general gaming, I really love that we've kind of opened it up to a whole new audience as well, you know, and it's not just about the music games.

2060
01:56:08,791 --> 01:56:09,271
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, then.

2061
01:56:10,092 --> 01:56:13,934
[SPEAKER_31]: Probably I'll give you a call the next time I get Santa Cruz and have a present for you guys.

2062
01:56:14,474 --> 01:56:15,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sweet.

2063
01:56:15,114 --> 01:56:15,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2064
01:56:15,554 --> 01:56:16,375
[SPEAKER_16]: And I love Santa Cruz.

2065
01:56:16,455 --> 01:56:17,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the boardwalk there.

2066
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:19,130
[SPEAKER_31]: We'll have to go to the arcades.

2067
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:20,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

2068
01:56:20,131 --> 01:56:21,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the arcades there are awesome.

2069
01:56:21,611 --> 01:56:22,751
[SPEAKER_16]: They have discs of Tron.

2070
01:56:23,231 --> 01:56:23,631
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweet.

2071
01:56:23,711 --> 01:56:24,151
[SPEAKER_16]: They do.

2072
01:56:24,351 --> 01:56:24,912
[SPEAKER_16]: They do.

2073
01:56:25,252 --> 01:56:25,532
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2074
01:56:25,552 --> 01:56:26,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you very much for your call.

2075
01:56:26,632 --> 01:56:27,272
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it, buddy.

2076
01:56:27,892 --> 01:56:28,272
[SPEAKER_31]: No worries.

2077
01:56:28,292 --> 01:56:28,792
[SPEAKER_31]: See you later.

2078
01:56:28,913 --> 01:56:29,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

2079
01:56:30,993 --> 01:56:32,773
[SPEAKER_16]: So refreshing to hear from the folks around the world.

2080
01:56:32,833 --> 01:56:33,334
[SPEAKER_16]: It's so great.

2081
01:56:33,754 --> 01:56:35,374
[SPEAKER_16]: How come we haven't had any Canadians tonight?

2082
01:56:36,174 --> 01:56:36,994
[SPEAKER_16]: That's very strange.

2083
01:56:37,034 --> 01:56:38,135
[SPEAKER_34]: We want Canadians to call next.

2084
01:56:38,155 --> 01:56:38,695
[SPEAKER_16]: We want Canadians.

2085
01:56:39,415 --> 01:56:39,675
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2086
01:56:40,174 --> 01:56:41,515
[SPEAKER_34]: I declare there must be Canadians.

2087
01:56:41,675 --> 01:56:48,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Not that we don't love the Argentina, the Mexico, the U.S., you know, but Europe might be asking a bit much because it's probably like what now?

2088
01:56:48,798 --> 01:56:50,579
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like the sun's starting to rise over there.

2089
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:52,000
[SPEAKER_16]: But what about some Canadians?

2090
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there's got to be a few listening.

2091
01:56:53,661 --> 01:56:54,601
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's go to another call.

2092
01:56:54,982 --> 01:56:55,982
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2093
01:56:56,002 --> 01:56:56,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

2094
01:56:57,423 --> 01:56:58,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, this is Jaden.

2095
01:56:59,484 --> 01:57:00,004
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, who?

2096
01:57:01,325 --> 01:57:01,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Jaden.

2097
01:57:02,405 --> 01:57:03,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, what's on your mind?

2098
01:57:04,286 --> 01:57:04,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing much.

2099
01:57:04,847 --> 01:57:07,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to congratulate you on your fifth.

2100
01:57:08,516 --> 01:57:09,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you very much.

2101
01:57:09,436 --> 01:57:09,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

2102
01:57:09,737 --> 01:57:10,457
[SPEAKER_34]: Are you my fifth beer?

2103
01:57:12,198 --> 01:57:12,478
[SPEAKER_34]: Pardon?

2104
01:57:12,918 --> 01:57:13,318
[SPEAKER_34]: Nothing.

2105
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:14,418
[SPEAKER_34]: I was saying my fifth beer.

2106
01:57:16,439 --> 01:57:17,840
[SPEAKER_16]: I do that all the time.

2107
01:57:21,841 --> 01:57:23,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you very much.

2108
01:57:23,702 --> 01:57:28,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a particular something something that you want to share with the listeners tonight?

2109
01:57:29,244 --> 01:57:30,685
[SPEAKER_16]: How long have you been listening to this show?

2110
01:57:32,157 --> 01:57:41,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, let's see, I think this is going on my third Ah, awesome Well, what do you think has been a big, big game story that you really enjoyed our coverage on in the past three years?

2111
01:57:42,625 --> 01:57:59,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the anticipation of the Xbox 360 Ah, the anticipation of the Xbox 360 You know, I wasn't sold on the Xbox 360 at first I really wasn't And also the introduction of new systems in general

2112
01:58:00,618 --> 01:58:09,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, kind of like being able to kind of be watching this new wave of the whole next-gen systems, kind of watch this unfold, because, you know, all these systems didn't exist.

2113
01:58:09,607 --> 01:58:12,129
[SPEAKER_16]: The PS3, the Wii, the 360 back when we started.

2114
01:58:12,169 --> 01:58:14,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Hell, I don't even think the Xbox existed when we first started.

2115
01:58:15,192 --> 01:58:16,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Or maybe it had just come out.

2116
01:58:16,533 --> 01:58:16,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2117
01:58:17,194 --> 01:58:18,235
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was out.

2118
01:58:18,495 --> 01:58:19,696
[SPEAKER_16]: When did the Xbox come out?

2119
01:58:19,716 --> 01:58:19,696
2001?

2120
01:58:19,736 --> 01:58:21,538
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe it was just out.

2121
01:58:22,158 --> 01:58:24,080
[SPEAKER_16]: But anyway, yeah, we kind of got to watch this all unfold.

2122
01:58:24,641 --> 01:58:25,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, what...

2123
01:58:26,442 --> 01:58:28,724
[SPEAKER_16]: You bought a 360 the day they came out, right?

2124
01:58:28,744 --> 01:58:28,824
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2125
01:58:29,404 --> 01:58:30,645
[SPEAKER_16]: You bought a bidded one.

2126
01:58:30,685 --> 01:58:32,146
[SPEAKER_16]: You eBayed one or something, didn't you?

2127
01:58:32,186 --> 01:58:33,107
[SPEAKER_16]: I bought it off Craigslist.

2128
01:58:33,447 --> 01:58:35,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I remember getting so mad at you about that.

2129
01:58:36,349 --> 01:58:37,450
[SPEAKER_15]: But why did you do it?

2130
01:58:37,530 --> 01:58:38,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it the hype?

2131
01:58:38,371 --> 01:58:39,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it the games?

2132
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:40,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to talk about it.

2133
01:58:41,453 --> 01:58:42,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm crazy.

2134
01:58:43,314 --> 01:58:45,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Very crazy when it comes to talking about games and stuff.

2135
01:58:45,816 --> 01:58:46,996
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2136
01:58:47,056 --> 01:58:49,258
[SPEAKER_15]: I just felt like I wanted one.

2137
01:58:50,819 --> 01:58:51,620
[SPEAKER_15]: It was big.

2138
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:55,202
[SPEAKER_15]: I got to keep my edge at work, you know?

2139
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,782
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what sold me on Xbox 360, sad but true?

2140
01:58:59,583 --> 01:59:00,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Geometry Wars.

2141
01:59:01,564 --> 01:59:03,166
[SPEAKER_16]: And Xbox Live Arcade in general.

2142
01:59:03,326 --> 01:59:06,528
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, this is the coolest thing ever.

2143
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:09,711
[SPEAKER_16]: It wasn't even any of the launch games that I really cared about.

2144
01:59:09,731 --> 01:59:13,334
[SPEAKER_16]: Although I did buy Cameo and I don't know what else I bought at launch.

2145
01:59:13,774 --> 01:59:15,296
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was Xbox Live Arcade.

2146
01:59:15,516 --> 01:59:16,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I bought Cameo, Ridge Racer 6.

2147
01:59:17,758 --> 01:59:24,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I pretty much bought almost everything that came out at launch between launch and March.

2148
01:59:24,813 --> 01:59:45,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I think one of the big ones I bought was Call of Duty 2, and then I bought Project Gotham Racing 3, also Cameo, and then Perfect Dark Zero, and I bought almost everything that came out at launch.

2149
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:50,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Caller, did you get in on the Xbox 360 craze?

2150
01:59:51,225 --> 01:59:51,885
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I didn't.

2151
01:59:52,865 --> 01:59:54,046
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't buy one until way later, huh?

2152
01:59:54,485 --> 02:00:02,212
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I don't have one Because I'm not an Xbox person I'm a Nintendo person No No, I'm not that crazy I thought about it at one point in time, but

2153
02:00:17,844 --> 02:00:18,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

2154
02:00:37,499 --> 02:00:38,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Over on Sunrise.

2155
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:39,861
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where we were.

2156
02:00:39,901 --> 02:00:41,121
[SPEAKER_16]: That was awesome.

2157
02:00:41,141 --> 02:00:42,822
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had a listener of the show on the line.

2158
02:00:43,342 --> 02:00:44,083
[SPEAKER_16]: A couple.

2159
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:46,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to know if any of them are still listening.

2160
02:00:46,324 --> 02:00:47,485
[SPEAKER_16]: For the love of God, email us.

2161
02:00:47,525 --> 02:00:48,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get together and play Wii sometime.

2162
02:00:48,665 --> 02:00:51,247
[SPEAKER_34]: I want to know who the girl who got the Wii hat was.

2163
02:00:52,029 --> 02:00:55,170
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura's reaction to the DS, something that shares your namesake.

2164
02:00:55,190 --> 02:00:55,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you approve?

2165
02:01:22,418 --> 02:01:23,098
[SPEAKER_34]: I guess.

2166
02:01:23,238 --> 02:01:24,599
[SPEAKER_34]: It's almost as cool as me.

2167
02:01:25,059 --> 02:01:27,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you remember when we went and bought our DS?

2168
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:34,263
[SPEAKER_15]: We went to Best Buy, bought them there, and then we also went to Benihana's afterwards for lunch.

2169
02:01:34,983 --> 02:01:37,484
[SPEAKER_15]: That is the most money I've ever spent in a single day, probably.

2170
02:01:37,704 --> 02:01:42,586
[SPEAKER_34]: I found Dan's box for his DS, because they all got theirs at GameStop before launch date, of course.

2171
02:01:43,106 --> 02:01:45,487
[SPEAKER_34]: And it said, this DS is reserved for Dan.

2172
02:01:45,607 --> 02:01:46,768
[SPEAKER_34]: If you touch it, you die.

2173
02:01:47,308 --> 02:01:49,009
[SPEAKER_34]: I won't forget the first time... The post-it's still on the box.

2174
02:01:49,129 --> 02:01:51,850
[SPEAKER_15]: The first PSP I bought, I bought it, and then I...

2175
02:01:53,052 --> 02:01:53,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

2176
02:01:53,172 --> 02:01:54,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than... Other than the...

2177
02:02:21,309 --> 02:02:26,991
[SPEAKER_06]: The one episode that really sticks out to me because I have a recording of it is 120.

2178
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:29,071
[SPEAKER_16]: What's so special about 120?

2179
02:02:29,611 --> 02:02:32,912
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll have to forgive us, but they all start to blend together when you've been doing it for five years.

2180
02:02:34,553 --> 02:02:41,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Because one of the big things is that Loki was called the Xbox 2 at the time.

2181
02:02:43,335 --> 02:02:43,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Did he?

2182
02:02:44,436 --> 02:02:46,036
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, he probably didn't have a name then.

2183
02:02:46,576 --> 02:02:48,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Did it have a name or was he just being dumb?

2184
02:02:50,216 --> 02:02:54,418
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have a name for it, but he mentioned it several times.

2185
02:02:55,098 --> 02:02:55,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

2186
02:02:55,999 --> 02:02:56,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, shit.

2187
02:02:57,059 --> 02:03:00,681
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if they don't have a name for it yet, obviously it's going to be the Xbox 2.

2188
02:03:01,061 --> 02:03:05,484
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's funny to go back and listen to what we thought about things before they actually came out.

2189
02:03:05,644 --> 02:03:11,507
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're going to be stupid and name it 360 because it'll be circular.

2190
02:03:11,567 --> 02:03:11,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2191
02:03:13,341 --> 02:03:14,841
[SPEAKER_06]: You called the PS3 name, right?

2192
02:03:15,362 --> 02:03:17,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, because they didn't innovate on their name.

2193
02:03:18,682 --> 02:03:20,403
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to put a 3 on there.

2194
02:03:20,743 --> 02:03:21,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2195
02:03:21,763 --> 02:03:22,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2196
02:03:22,483 --> 02:03:25,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Caller, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but thanks so much for calling.

2197
02:03:25,924 --> 02:03:26,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, sure, anytime.

2198
02:03:26,784 --> 02:03:27,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, later.

2199
02:03:28,285 --> 02:03:28,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, bye.

2200
02:03:29,085 --> 02:03:29,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

2201
02:03:30,345 --> 02:03:31,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's do a few more calls.

2202
02:03:32,026 --> 02:03:33,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's starting to trickle up a little bit.

2203
02:03:33,266 --> 02:03:37,167
[SPEAKER_16]: We still have some people hammering us that have been since the beginning, so we'll get to everybody.

2204
02:03:37,207 --> 02:03:38,947
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to keep calling until the calls stop coming in.

2205
02:03:40,008 --> 02:03:41,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Or we pass out tired, whichever happens first.

2206
02:03:42,881 --> 02:03:44,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2207
02:03:45,567 --> 02:03:47,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Token Canadian calling in.

2208
02:03:47,852 --> 02:03:50,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, what's your name for those who don't know?

2209
02:03:50,818 --> 02:03:51,860
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Toshin, what's up guys?

2210
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Toshin, what's up?

2211
02:03:53,644 --> 02:03:53,825
[SPEAKER_16]: See?

2212
02:03:54,682 --> 02:03:56,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Ask and ye shall receive.

2213
02:03:56,083 --> 02:03:57,323
[SPEAKER_16]: We got a Canadian on the line.

2214
02:03:57,423 --> 02:03:58,263
[SPEAKER_34]: Yay, thank you.

2215
02:03:59,404 --> 02:04:00,184
[SPEAKER_16]: What else can I do?

2216
02:04:00,204 --> 02:04:01,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2217
02:04:01,665 --> 02:04:03,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Do a cartwheel or say a boot.

2218
02:04:03,905 --> 02:04:04,365
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm kidding.

2219
02:04:04,786 --> 02:04:05,406
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm totally kidding.

2220
02:04:05,426 --> 02:04:06,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll bring pizza or something.

2221
02:04:06,186 --> 02:04:06,486
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2222
02:04:07,727 --> 02:04:10,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Toshin, dude, anything you want to say?

2223
02:04:10,528 --> 02:04:13,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you only calling in because we forced you to or is there anything you want to say or ask or what?

2224
02:04:14,449 --> 02:04:14,869
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

2225
02:04:14,909 --> 02:04:17,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be like everybody else and congratulate you on the five years.

2226
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:18,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

2227
02:04:18,851 --> 02:04:22,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not the longest call or listener, but I've been around for a while and

2228
02:04:23,243 --> 02:04:27,004
[SPEAKER_10]: I just haven't had the nerve to jump in the chat room as much as I should.

2229
02:04:28,245 --> 02:04:31,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you were on DDR Freak like several years ago.

2230
02:04:31,265 --> 02:04:32,626
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been posting there a while, right?

2231
02:04:33,306 --> 02:04:36,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we've got a small little thread for our DDR people.

2232
02:04:36,787 --> 02:04:37,087
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweet.

2233
02:04:37,427 --> 02:04:46,650
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason why I mention that is because obviously when our show first started, a large, large contingent of our listeners were all DDR Freak members and people from that community.

2234
02:04:46,730 --> 02:04:49,411
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I do remember seeing your face around there back in the day, so.

2235
02:04:50,285 --> 02:04:54,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the small little Nova Scotia thread for anybody who wants to go check it out.

2236
02:04:54,689 --> 02:04:55,570
[SPEAKER_16]: We still got some life.

2237
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:59,653
[SPEAKER_16]: And the machines have not frozen over, contrary to popular belief.

2238
02:05:00,554 --> 02:05:01,355
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're not.

2239
02:05:01,815 --> 02:05:06,460
[SPEAKER_10]: But we gotta deal with some of the machines' issues, because they're in bad, bad shape.

2240
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:09,843
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what my favorite thread on DDR Freak was always?

2241
02:05:10,523 --> 02:05:10,703
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2242
02:05:10,723 --> 02:05:12,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Was the Antarctica thread.

2243
02:05:13,526 --> 02:05:14,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was pretty funny.

2244
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:16,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

2245
02:05:45,248 --> 02:05:45,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

2246
02:05:46,068 --> 02:05:48,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Toshin, thanks for answering the call.

2247
02:05:48,309 --> 02:05:48,889
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

2248
02:05:49,449 --> 02:05:50,789
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other last things you want to say?

2249
02:05:50,809 --> 02:05:57,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to just... How are you doing with... I know you've played DDR and B-Money for a while.

2250
02:05:57,771 --> 02:06:00,031
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your favorite game that you've played throughout the years?

2251
02:06:00,151 --> 02:06:03,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it just like B-Money or DDR Stepping?

2252
02:06:03,992 --> 02:06:07,193
[SPEAKER_16]: My favorite music game that I've played in the past five years?

2253
02:06:07,693 --> 02:06:07,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2254
02:06:08,473 --> 02:06:11,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely, without a doubt, Beatmania 2DX8 style in the arcade.

2255
02:06:12,461 --> 02:06:13,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, sexy.

2256
02:06:30,425 --> 02:06:33,726
[SPEAKER_16]: and those that know me well know what a big ham I am.

2257
02:06:34,366 --> 02:06:36,667
[SPEAKER_16]: One of my favorite things to do is host.

2258
02:06:36,687 --> 02:06:41,789
[SPEAKER_16]: When I was young, I always wanted to be a game show host, if it's not completely obvious through some of the things that happen on this show.

2259
02:06:43,049 --> 02:06:47,090
[SPEAKER_16]: That's part of the reason I continue to be an MC-ish sort of role on this show.

2260
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:49,351
[SPEAKER_16]: I love doing that kind of stuff at tournaments.

2261
02:06:49,791 --> 02:06:57,395
[SPEAKER_16]: and running the Beatmania 2DX tournament, one of the very few that's ever been run, being able to run that tournament on that 8-style machine at Scandia was a dream.

2262
02:06:57,495 --> 02:06:59,596
[SPEAKER_16]: And the mix itself was awesome.

2263
02:06:59,636 --> 02:07:04,578
[SPEAKER_16]: The music that was in it and everything, just really the peak of the 2DX series for me.

2264
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:09,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So are you planning to get distorted and stuff in the coming weeks?

2265
02:07:09,444 --> 02:07:13,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, like I said, 8th was kind of the peak, and my interest in the series has kind of waned since then.

2266
02:07:14,249 --> 02:07:19,314
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I will always love the game, and I can't justify spending $80 on it.

2267
02:07:19,354 --> 02:07:20,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Not now, not right now.

2268
02:07:20,355 --> 02:07:23,838
[SPEAKER_16]: You can always... No, but I don't go there, you know.

2269
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:25,640
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2270
02:07:26,301 --> 02:07:27,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Import, man, come on.

2271
02:07:28,355 --> 02:07:32,458
[SPEAKER_16]: I import straight to my hard drive.

2272
02:07:32,658 --> 02:07:35,200
[SPEAKER_16]: The Rob D says from Bob Barker to Rob Roberts.

2273
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:36,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, that would be my dream.

2274
02:07:36,401 --> 02:07:43,486
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually secretly in the back of my mind, I secretly wish that they would do like an American Idol style show to replace him because I would so go there.

2275
02:07:44,347 --> 02:07:45,288
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what we have to hear now?

2276
02:07:45,808 --> 02:07:46,709
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to hear that song.

2277
02:07:47,869 --> 02:07:48,890
[SPEAKER_16]: The Come On Down?

2278
02:07:49,491 --> 02:07:49,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2279
02:07:50,551 --> 02:07:52,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe later in the show because I don't have it queued up right now.

2280
02:07:53,614 --> 02:07:55,435
[SPEAKER_10]: You never have it queued up at this time though.

2281
02:07:56,638 --> 02:07:57,358
[SPEAKER_16]: It's getting late.

2282
02:07:57,378 --> 02:07:57,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me a break.

2283
02:07:58,779 --> 02:07:59,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I need more pizza.

2284
02:07:59,600 --> 02:07:59,880
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2285
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:01,100
[SPEAKER_16]: We ate it all.

2286
02:08:01,160 --> 02:08:01,721
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all gone.

2287
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:03,221
[SPEAKER_16]: The three of us ate the whole damn pizza.

2288
02:08:03,922 --> 02:08:04,382
[SPEAKER_16]: A large.

2289
02:08:04,642 --> 02:08:05,563
[SPEAKER_10]: We're piggies.

2290
02:08:06,663 --> 02:08:07,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

2291
02:08:07,304 --> 02:08:07,564
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2292
02:08:08,544 --> 02:08:09,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye, Tosha.

2293
02:08:09,084 --> 02:08:09,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks so much for the call.

2294
02:08:09,805 --> 02:08:10,365
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

2295
02:08:10,425 --> 02:08:10,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2296
02:08:11,186 --> 02:08:11,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy 5th, guys.

2297
02:08:11,946 --> 02:08:12,166
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2298
02:08:12,206 --> 02:08:12,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2299
02:08:13,027 --> 02:08:13,467
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care, buddy.

2300
02:08:15,208 --> 02:08:15,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Love that.

2301
02:08:16,249 --> 02:08:18,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Ask for a Canadian and you shall receive a Canadian.

2302
02:08:19,171 --> 02:08:28,178
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we're well past the two-hour mark now, so we're going to go into the two-minute lightning round, and now all our calls are going to be wrapped up in two minutes or less.

2303
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:31,220
[SPEAKER_16]: So here we go, starting off, and Jamie, your call.

2304
02:08:31,980 --> 02:08:32,281
[SPEAKER_34]: What?

2305
02:08:34,522 --> 02:08:34,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2306
02:08:35,523 --> 02:08:35,883
[SPEAKER_34]: Hello.

2307
02:08:35,963 --> 02:08:36,304
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

2308
02:08:37,044 --> 02:08:38,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, it's the Afro guy.

2309
02:08:38,725 --> 02:08:39,086
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

2310
02:08:39,106 --> 02:08:39,146
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi.

2311
02:08:39,646 --> 02:08:40,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

2312
02:08:41,809 --> 02:08:44,411
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind, Afro guy?

2313
02:08:44,811 --> 02:08:45,812
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

2314
02:08:45,892 --> 02:08:47,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Turn down your speakers, buddy.

2315
02:08:48,754 --> 02:08:49,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah, sorry.

2316
02:08:49,574 --> 02:08:51,236
[SPEAKER_16]: That's okay.

2317
02:08:52,476 --> 02:08:53,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you calling us from the UK?

2318
02:08:54,258 --> 02:08:54,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2319
02:08:54,998 --> 02:08:55,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, I knew it.

2320
02:08:55,839 --> 02:08:56,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I could tell from the accent.

2321
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:57,780
[SPEAKER_16]: That's amazing.

2322
02:08:58,801 --> 02:08:59,982
[SPEAKER_16]: And I recognize your name, too.

2323
02:09:00,282 --> 02:09:02,563
[SPEAKER_34]: Wow, so you're like, it's early morning.

2324
02:09:03,424 --> 02:09:04,845
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost six in the morning, yeah.

2325
02:09:04,865 --> 02:09:05,305
[SPEAKER_04]: You are hard.

2326
02:09:05,385 --> 02:09:06,746
[SPEAKER_34]: What are you doing awake?

2327
02:09:08,768 --> 02:09:10,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Listening to the fifth anniversary show.

2328
02:09:11,195 --> 02:09:12,836
[SPEAKER_34]: Well, we appreciate you tuning in.

2329
02:09:13,056 --> 02:09:15,096
[SPEAKER_16]: You are a hardcore fan, sir.

2330
02:09:16,817 --> 02:09:19,238
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish we weren't in the two-minute lightning round at this point.

2331
02:09:19,278 --> 02:09:20,058
[SPEAKER_16]: What do you want to say?

2332
02:09:21,058 --> 02:09:23,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say thanks for doing the show for five years.

2333
02:09:24,419 --> 02:09:27,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've only been listening for about two years since you started the podcast.

2334
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:28,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you're welcome.

2335
02:09:28,781 --> 02:09:34,623
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we do this for folks like you that continue to listen in, and especially around the world.

2336
02:09:34,683 --> 02:09:38,324
[SPEAKER_16]: That blows my mind how the Internet brings us that closer together as gaming fans.

2337
02:09:40,655 --> 02:09:40,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

2338
02:09:41,075 --> 02:09:43,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now I've cooled in, I think I'm going to go to bed.

2339
02:09:44,437 --> 02:09:45,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so tired.

2340
02:09:45,918 --> 02:09:47,039
[SPEAKER_34]: I say that's a good call.

2341
02:09:47,059 --> 02:09:47,719
[SPEAKER_34]: Sleep in today.

2342
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:48,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Sleep well.

2343
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:49,421
[SPEAKER_16]: You've earned it, my friend.

2344
02:09:50,401 --> 02:09:50,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2345
02:09:51,022 --> 02:09:51,242
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2346
02:09:51,262 --> 02:09:51,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Have a good one, buddy.

2347
02:09:52,562 --> 02:09:53,123
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2348
02:09:53,323 --> 02:09:53,903
[SPEAKER_16]: See you.

2349
02:09:53,923 --> 02:09:54,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

2350
02:09:56,485 --> 02:09:59,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Poor neighbors, because you must be blasting the show at 6 a.m.

2351
02:09:59,387 --> 02:09:59,687
[SPEAKER_16]: over there.

2352
02:10:00,506 --> 02:10:01,906
[SPEAKER_16]: because we're hearing it on the speakers.

2353
02:10:02,326 --> 02:10:04,987
[SPEAKER_34]: Unless he had a room with an echo, could be.

2354
02:10:05,487 --> 02:10:06,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it could be.

2355
02:10:06,728 --> 02:10:07,488
[SPEAKER_16]: He's trying to keep it down.

2356
02:10:07,528 --> 02:10:07,788
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

2357
02:10:07,808 --> 02:10:08,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Who knows?

2358
02:10:08,348 --> 02:10:09,388
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, two-minute lightning round.

2359
02:10:09,408 --> 02:10:10,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's take some more calls.

2360
02:10:10,469 --> 02:10:11,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2361
02:10:11,469 --> 02:10:11,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

2362
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:14,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

2363
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:15,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

2364
02:10:15,770 --> 02:10:16,650
[SPEAKER_16]: You got through finally.

2365
02:10:16,670 --> 02:10:17,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is this?

2366
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:18,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Nintendo Maniac 64.

2367
02:10:19,491 --> 02:10:21,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, Nintendo Maniac 64.

2368
02:10:21,172 --> 02:10:21,772
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

2369
02:10:24,773 --> 02:10:26,233
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2370
02:10:26,613 --> 02:10:27,833
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I'm on the opposite.

2371
02:10:27,973 --> 02:10:29,034
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not early morning.

2372
02:10:29,134 --> 02:10:29,794
[SPEAKER_25]: It's early...

2373
02:10:30,487 --> 02:10:33,688
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of late night, 1253 AM here.

2374
02:10:34,408 --> 02:10:41,771
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about 10 PM here, so we're getting pretty late even for California time, but that's okay.

2375
02:10:41,831 --> 02:10:42,391
[SPEAKER_16]: What's on your mind?

2376
02:10:44,312 --> 02:10:48,993
[SPEAKER_25]: One thing I remember is something someone said.

2377
02:10:49,393 --> 02:10:51,914
[SPEAKER_25]: It was about like your first game and stuff that you played.

2378
02:10:52,775 --> 02:10:57,076
[SPEAKER_25]: In all honesty, my very first game, I was like three or four something, was Mortal Kombat.

2379
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:00,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Your first game was Mortal Kombat?

2380
02:11:01,141 --> 02:11:02,502
[SPEAKER_16]: And I didn't even know what it was.

2381
02:11:03,683 --> 02:11:06,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Was it the version where they replaced the blood with the sweat, though?

2382
02:11:06,504 --> 02:11:07,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that doesn't count.

2383
02:11:07,244 --> 02:11:08,625
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it was the Genesis version.

2384
02:11:09,145 --> 02:11:10,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it was the Genesis version.

2385
02:11:10,406 --> 02:11:11,606
[SPEAKER_16]: So did you put in the blood code?

2386
02:11:13,547 --> 02:11:14,008
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2387
02:11:15,228 --> 02:11:16,069
[SPEAKER_25]: Only like three or four.

2388
02:11:16,369 --> 02:11:18,930
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't have my own game system until I was like...

2389
02:11:19,810 --> 02:11:22,913
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2390
02:11:42,482 --> 02:11:43,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, no.

2391
02:11:43,763 --> 02:11:49,968
[SPEAKER_16]: So, well, I'm just trying to say that, you know, exposing, you know, kids to violent games doesn't necessarily make them murderers.

2392
02:11:51,268 --> 02:11:51,629
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

2393
02:11:52,609 --> 02:11:53,930
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, anything else you want to share with listeners?

2394
02:11:55,091 --> 02:12:02,256
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, oh, I finally got my own pretty good computer rig now, not like a 533 megahertz PC.

2395
02:12:02,556 --> 02:12:06,059
[SPEAKER_16]: God, I thought he was going to say I got my own podcast.

2396
02:12:06,139 --> 02:12:07,100
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have a podcast.

2397
02:12:07,460 --> 02:12:08,641
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, that's all right.

2398
02:12:08,961 --> 02:12:11,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Two minutes is up, buddy, but thanks so much for the call and take care, okay?

2399
02:12:12,423 --> 02:12:12,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2400
02:12:12,903 --> 02:12:13,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, bye-bye.

2401
02:12:14,244 --> 02:12:14,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

2402
02:12:15,285 --> 02:12:16,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's go to another call.

2403
02:12:17,166 --> 02:12:19,488
[SPEAKER_16]: These poor people have been trying to get in all night long.

2404
02:12:19,528 --> 02:12:20,328
[SPEAKER_16]: We gotta get their calls.

2405
02:12:20,348 --> 02:12:21,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2406
02:12:21,209 --> 02:12:21,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

2407
02:12:22,530 --> 02:12:23,310
I don't know.

2408
02:12:23,891 --> 02:12:24,531
It's Dark Knight.

2409
02:12:25,132 --> 02:12:26,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, we can barely, barely hear you.

2410
02:12:26,753 --> 02:12:27,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Get a little closer to your night.

2411
02:12:27,974 --> 02:12:29,535
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Dark Knight, but we can barely hear him.

2412
02:12:30,255 --> 02:12:30,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello?

2413
02:12:31,316 --> 02:12:31,556
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey.

2414
02:12:32,137 --> 02:12:32,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, what's on your mind?

2415
02:12:34,258 --> 02:12:36,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, quick, um, quick shout-out.

2416
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:37,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, what?

2417
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:40,062
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, congratulate y'all guys on five years.

2418
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:45,043
[SPEAKER_20]: and hopefully y'all do five more years while y'all still around and everything like that.

2419
02:12:45,684 --> 02:12:52,770
[SPEAKER_20]: And to back talk the gaming thing, my first gaming system was the Atari 2600.

2420
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:55,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, mine too.

2421
02:12:55,512 --> 02:12:55,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Preach on.

2422
02:12:56,152 --> 02:12:57,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Atari 2600 was awesome.

2423
02:12:57,934 --> 02:13:00,295
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll try to do another five years if we can.

2424
02:13:00,355 --> 02:13:02,137
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to keep going until we're out of gas.

2425
02:13:04,091 --> 02:13:06,413
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2426
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:39,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Dark Knight, our time is halfway up, but I've got to ask you real quickly, is there anything that you want to share?

2427
02:13:39,863 --> 02:13:42,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know you've been a long-time listener of Orange Laundry.

2428
02:13:42,045 --> 02:13:44,066
[SPEAKER_16]: I recognize your name from chat from years ago.

2429
02:13:44,726 --> 02:13:45,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a favorite moment?

2430
02:13:47,428 --> 02:13:51,111
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki getting drunk and parents calling the show.

2431
02:13:51,131 --> 02:13:52,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, when our parents have called in?

2432
02:13:53,552 --> 02:13:55,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and Loki's was the best one.

2433
02:13:55,934 --> 02:13:57,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki had the best parent call.

2434
02:13:58,396 --> 02:14:00,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because it was sister that called.

2435
02:14:01,258 --> 02:14:01,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Mm-hmm.

2436
02:14:02,483 --> 02:14:04,824
[SPEAKER_20]: and then next thing you know it was the parents behind her.

2437
02:14:06,365 --> 02:14:07,165
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember that.

2438
02:14:07,185 --> 02:14:08,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Parents and grandparents, yeah.

2439
02:14:08,366 --> 02:14:09,026
[SPEAKER_16]: That was good.

2440
02:14:09,607 --> 02:14:10,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Dark Knight, our time's almost up.

2441
02:14:10,867 --> 02:14:11,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Quick, any last minute thoughts?

2442
02:14:13,269 --> 02:14:17,871
[SPEAKER_20]: No, just want to say happy five years, OLR, and keep it rocking, guys.

2443
02:14:18,031 --> 02:14:19,031
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we will do, buddy.

2444
02:14:19,051 --> 02:14:20,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks so much for your support over the past five years.

2445
02:14:20,912 --> 02:14:21,473
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

2446
02:14:21,853 --> 02:14:22,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2447
02:14:22,373 --> 02:14:22,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

2448
02:14:23,834 --> 02:14:25,515
[SPEAKER_16]: He got progressively louder as the call went on.

2449
02:14:25,575 --> 02:14:26,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Very nice job.

2450
02:14:26,355 --> 02:14:26,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Appreciate that.

2451
02:14:27,015 --> 02:14:28,776
[SPEAKER_16]: He started to turn the volume up or something.

2452
02:14:29,337 --> 02:14:29,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your call.

2453
02:14:31,158 --> 02:14:32,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, this is Orange Launch Radio.

2454
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:33,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is this?

2455
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:35,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, it's SSJ1.

2456
02:14:36,762 --> 02:14:37,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, how's it going?

2457
02:14:38,624 --> 02:14:40,025
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really got in, it looks like.

2458
02:14:43,007 --> 02:14:46,730
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to wish you guys a happy fifth birthday, I guess.

2459
02:14:49,092 --> 02:14:53,575
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also want to thank Rob for coming out to New York and having a great time with us.

2460
02:14:54,355 --> 02:14:55,356
[SPEAKER_16]: I had an awesome time.

2461
02:14:55,676 --> 02:14:57,657
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so much better this year than last year.

2462
02:14:57,697 --> 02:14:58,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And no offense against last year.

2463
02:14:58,958 --> 02:15:04,922
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we did our thing and had fun, but that was more of a me thing because I had more time this year to actually go around and do stuff.

2464
02:15:05,383 --> 02:15:08,705
[SPEAKER_16]: And the stuff we did this year was going to Dave & Buster's and going to that video game shop.

2465
02:15:08,745 --> 02:15:10,526
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just like we were buds hanging out.

2466
02:15:10,626 --> 02:15:11,087
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a good time.

2467
02:15:11,107 --> 02:15:11,927
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a really good time.

2468
02:15:12,528 --> 02:15:13,088
[SPEAKER_12]: It was great.

2469
02:15:13,188 --> 02:15:14,949
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, that's how gamers should be.

2470
02:15:15,209 --> 02:15:19,973
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, OR, we're just one big family.

2471
02:15:20,293 --> 02:15:21,854
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's how we should always be.

2472
02:15:22,589 --> 02:15:22,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

2473
02:15:22,849 --> 02:15:32,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, hey, since you're in New York, or at least the New York area, if a gamer is thinking of visiting the area, because New York is a huge tourist spot, where are some places they must go in New York?

2474
02:15:35,117 --> 02:15:47,964
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I've just moved back here, but, you know, big New York places, I would say go to the forums, because, you know, the locals really know where the good places are.

2475
02:15:47,984 --> 02:15:49,806
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's a lot of places...

2476
02:15:51,107 --> 02:15:51,847
[SPEAKER_12]: what about Nintendo World Store

2477
02:16:12,503 --> 02:16:13,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, Nintendo World Store is great.

2478
02:16:14,044 --> 02:16:17,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I thought you meant, like, arcades type stuff.

2479
02:16:18,046 --> 02:16:18,606
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's true.

2480
02:16:18,646 --> 02:16:19,066
[SPEAKER_16]: That's true.

2481
02:16:19,386 --> 02:16:27,370
[SPEAKER_16]: And those are good stuff to point out, too, because, you know, certain people, when they try, you know, they want to find that local fighting game or dance game community or whatever it is.

2482
02:16:27,850 --> 02:16:29,131
[SPEAKER_16]: SJ100, Matt, our time is up.

2483
02:16:29,791 --> 02:16:31,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Real, real quickly, last minute thoughts.

2484
02:16:32,353 --> 02:16:34,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, I, you know, I've been trying to call in all night.

2485
02:16:34,754 --> 02:16:36,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to ask this one question.

2486
02:16:36,755 --> 02:16:39,376
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you guys have been on for five years, and

2487
02:16:40,123 --> 02:16:45,547
[SPEAKER_12]: What would be the one thing you would like to accomplish within the next five years?

2488
02:16:48,589 --> 02:16:50,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Big question, so I'm going to let someone else start off.

2489
02:16:50,670 --> 02:16:52,992
[SPEAKER_16]: What would be the one thing you'd like to accomplish in the next five years?

2490
02:16:53,873 --> 02:16:54,413
[SPEAKER_16]: With the show?

2491
02:16:57,195 --> 02:16:58,796
[SPEAKER_16]: With the show or in general or what?

2492
02:16:59,737 --> 02:17:02,078
[SPEAKER_16]: With the show.

2493
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,862
[SPEAKER_34]: I would really call this ambitious.

2494
02:17:07,762 --> 02:17:13,167
[SPEAKER_34]: But I would really like to not only do this internet-based, but do it satellite-based as well.

2495
02:17:15,589 --> 02:17:15,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki?

2496
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:21,113
[SPEAKER_15]: To have my wife approve of the show.

2497
02:17:21,994 --> 02:17:23,075
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a big one, right?

2498
02:17:23,095 --> 02:17:24,656
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a very lofty goal right there.

2499
02:17:25,437 --> 02:17:32,203
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to be a little bit controversial because I know how Jamie feels about this idea, but I'm going to say video.

2500
02:17:34,384 --> 02:17:35,906
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be cool, you know.

2501
02:17:36,753 --> 02:17:39,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you know, Rob, that I'm kind of in that business.

2502
02:17:40,194 --> 02:17:43,356
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys ever need someone to shoot it or direct it, I'm here.

2503
02:17:44,296 --> 02:17:45,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Help me talk Jamie into it.

2504
02:17:45,577 --> 02:17:46,457
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what you've got to help me do.

2505
02:17:48,418 --> 02:17:49,518
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we've really got to let you go.

2506
02:17:49,598 --> 02:17:50,219
[SPEAKER_16]: We're over time.

2507
02:17:50,259 --> 02:17:51,559
[SPEAKER_16]: But take care, buddy.

2508
02:17:51,719 --> 02:17:52,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks so much.

2509
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:53,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Take it easy, guys.

2510
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:53,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

2511
02:17:55,141 --> 02:17:56,241
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, I think it's slowing down.

2512
02:17:56,281 --> 02:17:57,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we've only got a couple calls left.

2513
02:17:57,502 --> 02:17:59,383
[SPEAKER_16]: But I really want to give a chance for everybody to get through.

2514
02:18:00,423 --> 02:18:01,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, how about you?

2515
02:18:02,004 --> 02:18:02,944
[SPEAKER_34]: Hello.

2516
02:18:02,964 --> 02:18:05,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

2517
02:18:06,121 --> 02:18:06,581
[SPEAKER_34]: Who be?

2518
02:18:08,423 --> 02:18:09,744
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Wonder Dog Harold.

2519
02:18:10,164 --> 02:18:10,804
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi!

2520
02:18:10,824 --> 02:18:13,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

2521
02:18:13,786 --> 02:18:15,107
[SPEAKER_34]: What do you have to say to us?

2522
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:16,988
[SPEAKER_34]: What do you have to say for yourself?

2523
02:18:18,910 --> 02:18:21,171
[SPEAKER_25]: Congratulations on your 5th anniversary.

2524
02:18:21,452 --> 02:18:22,332
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2525
02:18:22,933 --> 02:18:23,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you get us a present?

2526
02:18:25,875 --> 02:18:29,197
[SPEAKER_25]: No, like the customary gift for the 5th anniversary is this.

2527
02:18:29,217 --> 02:18:29,477
[SPEAKER_25]: Is what?

2528
02:18:30,258 --> 02:18:30,678
[SPEAKER_16]: It's wood.

2529
02:18:32,079 --> 02:18:32,579
[SPEAKER_25]: It's wood.

2530
02:18:32,979 --> 02:18:33,640
[SPEAKER_16]: It's wood.

2531
02:18:35,239 --> 02:18:35,859
[SPEAKER_16]: I got wood.

2532
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:38,360
[SPEAKER_34]: I have no wood.

2533
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:39,061
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.

2534
02:18:40,001 --> 02:18:40,782
[SPEAKER_25]: No gift needed.

2535
02:18:40,882 --> 02:18:43,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Will you try to get some wood for our fifth anniversary?

2536
02:18:46,264 --> 02:18:46,644
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe.

2537
02:18:46,864 --> 02:18:47,285
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2538
02:18:48,205 --> 02:18:51,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a game out there that gives you wood?

2539
02:18:53,968 --> 02:18:54,248
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2540
02:18:54,568 --> 02:18:54,748
[SPEAKER_16]: No?

2541
02:18:55,788 --> 02:19:00,411
[SPEAKER_16]: That's good because, you know, that would be maybe crossing the line a bit.

2542
02:19:00,651 --> 02:19:00,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

2543
02:19:00,871 --> 02:19:03,492
[SPEAKER_16]: There's been no game character ever that might give you a little wood?

2544
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:05,440
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2545
02:19:05,761 --> 02:19:07,782
[SPEAKER_16]: My first video game crush was Ryu from Street Fighter 2.

2546
02:19:07,882 --> 02:19:08,022
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

2547
02:19:08,042 --> 02:19:08,743
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I tried to, like, like...

2548
02:19:30,509 --> 02:19:32,169
[SPEAKER_25]: Dick and Tingle in there real quick.

2549
02:19:32,189 --> 02:19:33,370
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, Tingle, Tingle.

2550
02:19:33,390 --> 02:19:35,110
[SPEAKER_34]: No, this was when I was in high school.

2551
02:19:37,071 --> 02:19:37,591
[SPEAKER_16]: I gotcha.

2552
02:19:37,971 --> 02:19:40,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, any character ever given you wood?

2553
02:19:41,132 --> 02:19:41,312
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2554
02:19:41,732 --> 02:19:42,432
[SPEAKER_16]: No Dead or Alive?

2555
02:19:42,452 --> 02:19:43,212
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2556
02:19:44,412 --> 02:19:48,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody in our chat room is trying to start a petition for Dead or Alive Extreme Volleyball with men.

2557
02:19:49,253 --> 02:19:51,074
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I don't know about that one.

2558
02:19:51,454 --> 02:19:53,634
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, any last minute thoughts, caller?

2559
02:19:55,515 --> 02:19:55,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Nope.

2560
02:19:56,275 --> 02:19:58,876
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, you're a man of many words, Wonder Dog Carol.

2561
02:19:59,096 --> 02:19:59,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks so much for the call.

2562
02:19:59,936 --> 02:20:00,116
[SPEAKER_16]: As usual.

2563
02:20:00,723 --> 02:20:01,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care, buddy.

2564
02:20:02,784 --> 02:20:03,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye-bye.

2565
02:20:03,324 --> 02:20:03,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

2566
02:20:05,945 --> 02:20:08,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember when he called in the match game a few weeks ago and was giving all one word answers?

2567
02:20:09,326 --> 02:20:11,427
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the phone lines may have stopped.

2568
02:20:11,687 --> 02:20:13,088
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no calls coming in right now.

2569
02:20:13,148 --> 02:20:15,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me give it just a few more minutes to make sure.

2570
02:20:15,048 --> 02:20:16,069
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we're going to call.

2571
02:20:16,089 --> 02:20:16,649
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there it is.

2572
02:20:16,729 --> 02:20:17,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's one more.

2573
02:20:17,909 --> 02:20:18,570
[SPEAKER_16]: This is going to be the last.

2574
02:20:18,590 --> 02:20:19,910
[SPEAKER_34]: You had to encourage them, Rob.

2575
02:20:19,930 --> 02:20:20,791
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the last call.

2576
02:20:20,831 --> 02:20:21,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Last call.

2577
02:20:21,591 --> 02:20:22,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, guys.

2578
02:20:23,071 --> 02:20:25,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and this is the last call of the night.

2579
02:20:25,992 --> 02:20:26,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's this?

2580
02:20:27,053 --> 02:20:28,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, my God.

2581
02:20:29,374 --> 02:20:29,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Who is this?

2582
02:20:30,905 --> 02:20:33,766
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2583
02:21:01,081 --> 02:21:13,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm sorry, I'm speechless, you know, I'm the biggest fangirl of the show is interested in me and well, you know.

2584
02:21:14,855 --> 02:21:15,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

2585
02:21:15,815 --> 02:21:26,779
[SPEAKER_16]: I forgot, this show has helped facilitate a few OL relationships, which has been very interesting how that community, just communities in general, can have that effect.

2586
02:21:27,079 --> 02:21:30,840
[SPEAKER_16]: I've met a few people I've dated through live journals in that community.

2587
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:36,982
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't say I've ever met anyone in a gaming-related community, but it's just interesting the way that works.

2588
02:21:37,382 --> 02:21:40,283
[SPEAKER_16]: But DT, you've been here for the whole thing.

2589
02:21:40,943 --> 02:21:43,344
[SPEAKER_16]: What would you say was the highlight of the past five years?

2590
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:45,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I don't know.

2591
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:52,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from that thing on 230, I'd probably have to go with Loki singing.

2592
02:21:53,842 --> 02:21:57,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't it amazing that after all these years, they still say that's their favorite moment?

2593
02:21:58,243 --> 02:21:59,423
[SPEAKER_16]: That was awful!

2594
02:22:00,103 --> 02:22:02,384
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm never doing it again, so like it.

2595
02:22:04,124 --> 02:22:05,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Live it up while it lasts.

2596
02:22:06,205 --> 02:22:08,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm calling in.

2597
02:22:08,265 --> 02:22:12,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the host to know I like their show.

2598
02:22:16,881 --> 02:22:17,342
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

2599
02:22:18,742 --> 02:22:21,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, DarkTetsuya, thank you for making it all worth it.

2600
02:22:21,363 --> 02:22:22,224
[SPEAKER_16]: That was wonderful.

2601
02:22:23,924 --> 02:22:26,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a quick FU, though.

2602
02:22:27,326 --> 02:22:27,646
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2603
02:22:28,166 --> 02:22:31,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know, DT, because that's like the perfect note to end on.

2604
02:22:31,107 --> 02:22:32,848
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you must, go for it.

2605
02:22:33,048 --> 02:22:33,308
[SPEAKER_16]: FU.

2606
02:22:34,569 --> 02:22:39,051
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to Burger King, because Missy has to work tonight.

2607
02:22:39,291 --> 02:22:40,311
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to work in general.

2608
02:22:40,351 --> 02:22:42,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's quit our jobs and move into the fort.

2609
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:43,950
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

2610
02:22:45,071 --> 02:22:46,091
[SPEAKER_16]: The OLR Fort.

2611
02:22:47,611 --> 02:22:49,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Dark Tetsuya, thank you so much for the call.

2612
02:22:49,812 --> 02:22:50,512
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate it.

2613
02:22:50,872 --> 02:22:52,313
[SPEAKER_16]: And you fucking won, by the way.

2614
02:22:52,373 --> 02:22:53,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Out of all the callers tonight, you won.

2615
02:22:54,073 --> 02:22:54,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

2616
02:22:55,574 --> 02:22:55,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2617
02:22:56,234 --> 02:22:56,694
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

2618
02:23:01,075 --> 02:23:02,116
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm calling in.

2619
02:23:03,616 --> 02:23:06,657
[SPEAKER_16]: I now demand that all future call-ins begin with that.

2620
02:23:09,875 --> 02:23:17,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Well guys, the calls have finally slowed down, but if we didn't get to you, we're so sorry that we didn't make your phone call.

2621
02:23:20,205 --> 02:23:26,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, Orange Lounge Radio, and even to the podcast listeners and those that weren't able to tune in live tonight and listen to us and be a part of this show.

2622
02:23:26,591 --> 02:23:27,291
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2623
02:23:56,786 --> 02:23:57,367
[SPEAKER_34]: Fuck everything.

2624
02:23:57,767 --> 02:23:58,508
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm just going to do the show.

2625
02:23:58,848 --> 02:23:59,328
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll try.

2626
02:23:59,669 --> 02:24:00,610
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, guys.

2627
02:24:01,871 --> 02:24:04,673
[SPEAKER_34]: And thank you for the five people who've sent me a dollar, by the way.

2628
02:24:05,774 --> 02:24:08,076
[SPEAKER_34]: There's not going to be a pump up the volume, though, on Tuesday.

2629
02:24:08,116 --> 02:24:18,406
[SPEAKER_34]: This is very important because Live 365 is doing a day of broadcasting silence to protest whoever those fuckheads are that are doing all this bullshit to internet radio.

2630
02:24:18,586 --> 02:24:19,046
[SPEAKER_16]: The government.

2631
02:24:19,167 --> 02:24:19,487
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

2632
02:24:19,647 --> 02:24:20,608
[SPEAKER_34]: Like I said, fuckheads.

2633
02:24:21,207 --> 02:24:25,316
[SPEAKER_34]: So no Pump Up the Volume on Tuesday, no nothing on Tuesday.

2634
02:24:26,298 --> 02:24:26,758
[SPEAKER_34]: However...

2635
02:24:27,543 --> 02:24:31,225
[SPEAKER_34]: You best hold on to your pants on Wednesday because Rob's going to be on, right?

2636
02:24:31,425 --> 02:24:32,746
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

2637
02:24:32,826 --> 02:24:37,909
[SPEAKER_16]: The door is always open for you, DarkSakura, if you want to come in and get a little revenge on Wednesday since you can have a Tuesday show.

2638
02:24:37,989 --> 02:24:38,969
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what you've got going on.

2639
02:24:38,989 --> 02:24:39,430
[SPEAKER_34]: We'll see.

2640
02:24:39,570 --> 02:24:40,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh wait, no, there is no show Wednesday.

2641
02:24:40,871 --> 02:24:41,731
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in Malibu Wednesday.

2642
02:24:41,891 --> 02:24:42,291
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't go.

2643
02:24:42,351 --> 02:24:42,631
[SPEAKER_16]: Bitch!

2644
02:24:43,232 --> 02:24:44,332
[SPEAKER_16]: So maybe you can do your show Wednesday.

2645
02:24:44,453 --> 02:24:45,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep me.

2646
02:24:45,293 --> 02:24:47,614
[SPEAKER_34]: And then drop me off in LA so I can go to Disneyland.

2647
02:24:47,634 --> 02:24:48,115
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll talk offline.

2648
02:24:48,135 --> 02:24:49,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm seeing Transformers on Wednesday.

2649
02:24:52,697 --> 02:25:01,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie reminded me, there are some thank yous that are badly, badly needed because there's like specific individuals we have to thank because they've really made the five years worth it.

2650
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,721
[SPEAKER_16]: And please, you know, God, it's just like an Oscar speech.

2651
02:25:03,761 --> 02:25:04,922
[SPEAKER_16]: We're afraid we're going to forget somebody.

2652
02:25:04,942 --> 02:25:05,622
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you guys think...

2653
02:25:06,403 --> 02:25:06,923
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2654
02:25:29,612 --> 02:25:34,455
[SPEAKER_16]: The man just does this because he wants to and he loves what we're doing.

2655
02:25:34,555 --> 02:25:37,456
[SPEAKER_16]: And without him, we would not be able to accomplish half of what we have.

2656
02:25:37,857 --> 02:25:40,118
[SPEAKER_16]: So VXJasonXV, you are the man.

2657
02:25:40,418 --> 02:25:41,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for all of your help.

2658
02:25:42,299 --> 02:25:51,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Even though we joke that the chat room is the invisible fourth host of Orange Lingerie, Jason is like this invisible thing that you don't always see on the air that's really holding this show up.

2659
02:25:51,604 --> 02:25:53,905
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you so much to Jason, first and foremost.

2660
02:25:54,605 --> 02:25:55,366
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to say...

2661
02:25:56,374 --> 02:26:10,027
[SPEAKER_16]: A big thank you to Travis Donovan of Travis Donovan Live because he kind of got me into the whole internet broadcasting thing and Jamie to some extent because obviously Under Station Live was the show we were doing before Orange Lounge Radio.

2662
02:26:10,107 --> 02:26:11,188
[SPEAKER_34]: I was the number one guest.

2663
02:26:11,609 --> 02:26:19,477
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think Travis really approved of this side project in the beginning because he saw it as maybe taking away from Under Station Live or what have you, but...

2664
02:26:20,037 --> 02:26:20,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

2665
02:26:35,072 --> 02:26:50,425
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to say a big thank you as well to Bobby Blackwolf and Scott and Lawrence and everybody over at allgames.com for enabling our show to a whole new audience because obviously signing up with allgames.com was one of the best moves we ever made in trying to grab ourselves some rabid fans.

2666
02:26:50,565 --> 02:26:53,808
[SPEAKER_16]: We just love the fact that our fan bases have kind of clicked in that way.

2667
02:26:54,188 --> 02:27:01,195
[SPEAKER_16]: And while not everybody on All Games May Like Our Show, those that have, we're very lucky to have over here listening to OLR as well.

2668
02:27:01,556 --> 02:27:06,901
[SPEAKER_16]: And we want to thank you guys for helping us get on board with the syndication over there and opening everything up over there.

2669
02:27:09,324 --> 02:27:10,545
[SPEAKER_16]: God, I don't even...

2670
02:27:11,408 --> 02:27:24,558
[SPEAKER_16]: So many, I mean, obviously each and every person that's ever listened to a live show, ever downloaded a podcast, everybody that's authored stories for the website, Mel B, Dark Tetsuya, Jimmy, DMN, anybody that's been a part of like OLR staff.

2671
02:27:24,918 --> 02:27:29,762
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank Chris for a lot over the past few years.

2672
02:27:29,822 --> 02:27:30,742
[SPEAKER_16]: God, who am I forgetting?

2673
02:27:31,063 --> 02:27:31,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Anybody?

2674
02:27:33,605 --> 02:27:34,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything?

2675
02:27:35,186 --> 02:27:36,187
[SPEAKER_34]: And viewers like you.

2676
02:27:37,427 --> 02:27:37,988
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean listeners.

2677
02:27:38,354 --> 02:27:43,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, and if I left you out, I'm very, very sorry, but it was kind of like a last minute thing I wanted to bring up.

2678
02:27:45,601 --> 02:27:47,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, do you have anything you want to say?

2679
02:27:47,603 --> 02:27:48,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Not until the afterbirth.

2680
02:27:49,826 --> 02:27:50,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we'll leave it at that.

2681
02:27:52,125 --> 02:27:57,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, by the way, was not an official host of Orange Launch Radio for the first 20 episodes, but you know what?

2682
02:27:57,507 --> 02:28:00,848
[SPEAKER_16]: He never missed a show and had that dedication, and it's very interesting.

2683
02:28:01,228 --> 02:28:09,310
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't even freaking know Loki, really, before this show started, but now it's just, you know... I drove you down to Golf Land, dude!

2684
02:28:09,370 --> 02:28:14,532
[SPEAKER_16]: But that was like... But it wasn't... Like, we didn't... You know, we didn't really know each other, like, at that point.

2685
02:28:14,572 --> 02:28:16,852
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I feel like I didn't really get to know you until this show.

2686
02:28:16,892 --> 02:28:19,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I know who you were, and obviously you did a lot of nice things...

2687
02:28:20,485 --> 02:28:30,491
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I want to say about Loki is that I know a lot of you think he's a total dick based on the things that he says about Max and stuff, but he's actually one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet offline, and I'm sorry for ruining your internet persona.

2688
02:28:30,511 --> 02:28:31,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

2689
02:28:31,832 --> 02:28:32,552
[SPEAKER_16]: But he really is.

2690
02:28:32,572 --> 02:28:33,433
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have a persona.

2691
02:28:34,293 --> 02:28:41,618
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jamie, too, because I know she has sometimes the internet persona of being the Queen Bee on Orange Light Radio.

2692
02:28:41,778 --> 02:28:42,298
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

2693
02:28:43,079 --> 02:28:45,420
[SPEAKER_16]: But she's really got a softy heart, too.

2694
02:28:45,460 --> 02:28:46,821
[SPEAKER_16]: You just don't always see it on the show.

2695
02:28:46,981 --> 02:28:47,281
[SPEAKER_16]: You do.

2696
02:28:47,341 --> 02:28:48,562
[SPEAKER_16]: It's made of sponge.

2697
02:28:49,062 --> 02:28:49,883
[SPEAKER_34]: No, it's not.

2698
02:28:51,557 --> 02:28:52,578
[SPEAKER_34]: It's plasmoid.

2699
02:28:52,878 --> 02:28:56,441
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a plasma, which means the electrons are charged and it's fiery.

2700
02:28:57,321 --> 02:28:58,422
[SPEAKER_34]: I have a fiery heart.

2701
02:29:01,284 --> 02:29:02,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2702
02:29:03,666 --> 02:29:04,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, one more thing.

2703
02:29:05,517 --> 02:29:18,484
[SPEAKER_16]: Not everybody got to get through on the Skype line tonight, but this was the interesting thing is that I logged into Skype today and there were voicemails waiting for us congratulating us on the fifth anniversary from people who wouldn't necessarily be able to be here on the show tonight.

2704
02:29:19,024 --> 02:29:22,226
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I hopped into chat and I said, well, looks like we have some voicemails.

2705
02:29:22,266 --> 02:29:23,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone want to add some?

2706
02:29:23,527 --> 02:29:24,728
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had some folks call in.

2707
02:29:25,068 --> 02:29:30,231
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're going to end it on this sound clip and then we're going to kind of wrap it up and be out of here.

2708
02:29:30,511 --> 02:29:31,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

2709
02:29:31,231 --> 02:29:32,892
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to do some last minute game stories before we get to that?

2710
02:29:33,690 --> 02:29:36,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, real quick, just real quick.

2711
02:29:37,453 --> 02:29:48,200
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a brand new hack in the PSP world that allows homebrew on any firmware so far, all the way up to 3.5.

2712
02:29:48,941 --> 02:29:54,084
[SPEAKER_15]: And funny enough, it does not use Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories, but it uses Luminous.

2713
02:29:54,504 --> 02:29:59,768
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a Luminati workaround or whatever, exploit, I guess they're calling it.

2714
02:30:00,228 --> 02:30:02,710
[SPEAKER_15]: But very interesting to see that.

2715
02:30:03,092 --> 02:30:07,878
[SPEAKER_15]: After all this time, Luminous can now allow you to run homebrew.

2716
02:30:09,099 --> 02:30:10,501
[SPEAKER_15]: It was there the whole time.

2717
02:30:10,541 --> 02:30:11,802
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost like a mystery novel.

2718
02:30:13,884 --> 02:30:16,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail.

2719
02:30:17,248 --> 02:30:17,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that it?

2720
02:30:17,689 --> 02:30:21,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

2721
02:30:21,193 --> 02:30:22,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Until the afterbirth.

2722
02:30:22,414 --> 02:30:23,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's get to the voicemails, folks.

2723
02:30:33,604 --> 02:30:37,526
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio, 5th Anniversary Show.

2724
02:30:37,726 --> 02:30:42,008
[SPEAKER_24]: I am Insanus, the guy who does the show on Thursday.

2725
02:30:42,028 --> 02:30:52,493
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to call you guys, wish you all a happy, happy, happy 5th Anniversary from everybody here at the Insanus Hour, which right now is me and four listeners.

2726
02:30:53,453 --> 02:30:54,634
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah.

2727
02:30:56,515 --> 02:30:57,055
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um...

2728
02:30:58,306 --> 02:31:05,128
[SPEAKER_24]: On behalf of everybody in the chat room right now, everyone is wanting to call you guys and wish you a happy OLR 5th anniversary.

2729
02:31:06,788 --> 02:31:18,072
[SPEAKER_24]: Rob, Jamie, Matt, thanks for letting me have an evening on the station where I can say as many curse words as I like and enjoy myself.

2730
02:31:18,092 --> 02:31:19,652
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys are the reason I love doing this.

2731
02:31:19,812 --> 02:31:21,373
[SPEAKER_24]: I got started because of you guys.

2732
02:31:21,413 --> 02:31:24,674
[SPEAKER_24]: You probably have heard this shit sometimes before, but it's true.

2733
02:31:25,234 --> 02:31:26,114
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys are awesome.

2734
02:31:26,579 --> 02:31:34,223
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully soon here I'll be in Sacramento and we will all have a good, good time.

2735
02:31:34,744 --> 02:31:36,785
[SPEAKER_24]: But let's just hope Rob keeps his pants on.

2736
02:31:37,205 --> 02:31:42,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Jamie doesn't beat me with a ferret and Matt doesn't throw an iPhone at me.

2737
02:31:43,369 --> 02:31:54,095
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways guys, this is a long voice mail and I think I should stop talking like this because I think I'm pissing you all off.

2738
02:31:55,106 --> 02:31:56,986
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, Rob, your mom called.

2739
02:31:57,246 --> 02:31:58,567
[SPEAKER_24]: She's still just as lonely as you.

2740
02:31:58,847 --> 02:32:02,467
[SPEAKER_24]: And my mom called, and she's still as lonely as you.

2741
02:32:02,487 --> 02:32:03,067
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I'm done.

2742
02:32:03,087 --> 02:32:04,908
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye.

2743
02:32:06,328 --> 02:32:08,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, Iron Clones Radio folks.

2744
02:32:08,668 --> 02:32:09,929
[SPEAKER_22]: It's, uh, Scott.

2745
02:32:09,969 --> 02:32:13,009
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I don't remember what my screen name is on the LLR.

2746
02:32:13,469 --> 02:32:13,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Rob.

2747
02:32:14,229 --> 02:32:14,689
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Jamie.

2748
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:18,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I talk to people all the time on MySpace and Xbox Live.

2749
02:32:19,170 --> 02:32:19,770
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob, it's me.

2750
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:20,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, anyway.

2751
02:32:23,854 --> 02:32:24,975
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, five years.

2752
02:32:25,115 --> 02:32:26,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Happy anniversary!

2753
02:32:26,596 --> 02:32:30,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, oh my, you know, the worst half, better half.

2754
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:33,101
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, well, I got to listen to you people.

2755
02:32:33,722 --> 02:32:37,184
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, yeah, uh, well, we wanted to say hello.

2756
02:32:37,204 --> 02:32:38,005
[SPEAKER_22]: Say hello.

2757
02:32:38,025 --> 02:32:39,386
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

2758
02:32:39,426 --> 02:32:41,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that would be good.

2759
02:32:42,148 --> 02:32:44,390
[SPEAKER_22]: He's more lesbian than the official lesbian.

2760
02:32:45,171 --> 02:32:46,252
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, more girl.

2761
02:32:46,332 --> 02:32:53,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, um, wow, five years of gaming goodness and listening to Loki bitch about women drivers.

2762
02:32:53,978 --> 02:32:54,518
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all good.

2763
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:56,800
[SPEAKER_22]: Two, five more years at least.

2764
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:58,901
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright, bye.

2765
02:32:59,341 --> 02:33:00,221
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, it's Missy.

2766
02:33:00,942 --> 02:33:02,583
[SPEAKER_30]: So, you know I had to call in, right?

2767
02:33:03,643 --> 02:33:05,364
[SPEAKER_30]: It'd be a 15th anniversary and all.

2768
02:33:06,545 --> 02:33:08,065
[SPEAKER_30]: Keep the work going.

2769
02:33:08,285 --> 02:33:09,286
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright, call in live.

2770
02:33:10,506 --> 02:33:11,367
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, let's see.

2771
02:33:11,387 --> 02:33:12,227
[SPEAKER_30]: 4-7-0-4.

2772
02:33:12,508 --> 02:33:17,490
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's been three years and three months already.

2773
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:20,952
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, that was a Wednesday too.

2774
02:33:20,972 --> 02:33:23,253
[SPEAKER_30]: Wasn't it Vanilla Sky that was the Wednesday show then?

2775
02:33:24,812 --> 02:33:26,894
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyway, congrats on five years.

2776
02:33:27,934 --> 02:33:33,918
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'll be thinking about you when the number works.

2777
02:33:34,098 --> 02:33:34,659
[SPEAKER_30]: Bye.

2778
02:33:35,039 --> 02:33:37,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what's up?

2779
02:33:38,621 --> 02:33:40,362
[SPEAKER_32]: This is Tiger Claw.

2780
02:33:40,382 --> 02:33:44,285
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to wish Orange Lounge Radio a happy five-year anniversary.

2781
02:33:44,685 --> 02:33:49,048
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been a long-time listener of the show since I first heard on allgames.com.

2782
02:33:49,608 --> 02:33:51,389
[SPEAKER_32]: And here's hoping for five more years.

2783
02:33:51,630 --> 02:33:52,050
[SPEAKER_32]: Take care.

2784
02:33:53,154 --> 02:33:55,316
[SPEAKER_27]: Hey all alive, this is Mystic Gohan.

2785
02:33:56,076 --> 02:34:00,780
[SPEAKER_27]: Congratulations on five years of podcasting, I guess.

2786
02:34:00,800 --> 02:34:06,825
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a question about, I saw Sky on Xbox Live with the HD DVD player.

2787
02:34:07,485 --> 02:34:10,508
[SPEAKER_27]: I was wondering if it's worth the buy because my brother kind of wants it.

2788
02:34:11,208 --> 02:34:14,451
[SPEAKER_27]: And he's wondering if you could get a PS3 instead just for Blu-ray.

2789
02:34:15,852 --> 02:34:18,694
[SPEAKER_27]: And yeah, you guys have been doing an awesome job.

2790
02:34:19,685 --> 02:34:22,646
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been listening for about two years now.

2791
02:34:22,906 --> 02:34:25,646
[SPEAKER_27]: You guys are just awesome.

2792
02:34:25,666 --> 02:34:27,727
[SPEAKER_27]: Keep doing what you're doing.

2793
02:34:27,747 --> 02:34:32,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

2794
02:34:45,811 --> 02:34:46,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Really either one.

2795
02:34:46,732 --> 02:34:51,055
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, they say Blu-ray is winning, but I don't know if that's just marketing smoke and mirrors.

2796
02:34:51,516 --> 02:34:52,757
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's too early to tell.

2797
02:34:52,877 --> 02:34:54,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Honestly, your safest bet is to not take the plunge yet.

2798
02:34:54,738 --> 02:35:01,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the reason why they're saying it's winning is because there's more Blu-ray players out there because each one of the PlayStation 3s is a Blu-ray player.

2799
02:35:02,084 --> 02:35:05,887
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're counting those in the numbers, whether people use them as a Blu-ray player or not.

2800
02:35:07,228 --> 02:35:07,428
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2801
02:35:07,649 --> 02:35:08,349
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's your answer.

2802
02:35:09,010 --> 02:35:09,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Short and sweet.

2803
02:35:10,371 --> 02:35:10,671
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2804
02:35:11,352 --> 02:35:12,192
[SPEAKER_16]: We're almost to the end.

2805
02:35:12,412 --> 02:35:15,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, Loki.

2806
02:35:16,826 --> 02:35:17,647
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm out of root beer.

2807
02:35:18,987 --> 02:35:19,648
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura.

2808
02:35:28,233 --> 02:35:30,595
[SPEAKER_16]: My final thought is thank you.

2809
02:35:30,975 --> 02:35:32,436
[SPEAKER_16]: To those that care, thank you.

2810
02:35:32,796 --> 02:35:33,637
[SPEAKER_16]: You keep it going.

2811
02:35:34,217 --> 02:35:35,098
