0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	26000	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, the 17th of June, 2007.
26000	29000	Happy Father's Day again to those of you folks that are gamer daddies.
29000	31000	We're going to get back into the gaming news.
31000	33000	Remember Orange Lounge Radio is released in two parts.
33000	35000	And if you haven't listened to part A, you missed a lot tonight.
35000	39000	So please go back to wherever you got this show and make sure you've tuned in to part A.
39000	41000	Let's continue on with tonight's program.
41000	44000	And I'm going to start us off with some more gaming news in this segment.
44000	48000	We talked a lot about PlayStation 3 and a little bit about computer games.
48000	51000	Started to dip into Xbox a little bit in the last segment.
51000	52000	We didn't really mention the Wii a whole lot.
52000	55000	But I do want to talk about Madden 2008.
55000	62000	And we don't talk a whole lot about sports games on this program because everybody likes their different genres.
62000	64000	Some of them are role-playing games.
64000	66000	We don't play a lot of sports games.
66000	70000	But some of these interesting new features in Madden 2008 are worth mentioning.
70000	77000	And I want to talk about the friend codes system and kind of one of the bummers about Madden 2008.
77000	82000	IGN recently interviewed the associate producer of Madden 08, Damien Zur.
82000	86000	And he's talked about that the game is not actually going to be using the friend codes.
86000	90000	You know how you've been collecting the Wii friend codes so you can trade Miis across the internet and stuff like that?
90000	92000	Madden 08 is not going to use that.
92000	96000	Quote, Madden Wii doesn't support the Wii's friend system during online play.
96000	99000	This is something we're still working on with Nintendo.
99000	105000	For now, our online play uses your EA Nation persona to search and manage your EA Messenger account.
105000	108000	So now you're going to have to balance this whole other thing.
108000	109000	But what?
109000	112000	What if this is something that they're going to support through all their EA games?
112000	115000	Which is fine then if they're going to do that.
115000	117000	As long as it's not...
117000	119000	I mean, you can call their friend code whatever you want.
119000	121000	If you've got to enter one in for each game, who gives a shit?
121000	122000	I mean...
122000	126000	I just kind of wish Nintendo would just wake up and say...
126000	129000	Because they're saying that we're having problems with Nintendo.
129000	131000	Why is Nintendo holding back on this stuff?
131000	133000	That's obviously what's going on here.
133000	135000	Nintendo's done this with the DS.
135000	138000	They held back on so much of what the DS actually had in it.
138000	142000	They didn't launch DS online until a year and a half after the system was out.
142000	147000	And then there was also the whole microphone and the voice chatting is just now happening.
147000	154000	I don't know if Nintendo likes to time release the features of their system to make it last longer or what the deal is.
154000	155000	But it's weird.
155000	156000	I thought it was more technical issues.
156000	157000	What's that? Explicit?
157000	159000	I thought it was more technical issues.
159000	163000	I don't know, but it just seems to me like you're not seeing any online games.
163000	164000	I don't think it's because no one wants to do it.
164000	170000	I think it's because Nintendo's kind of keeping some secrets down or something like that.
170000	172000	Bandit in the chatroom says,
172000	178000	Online play doesn't start until Nintendo says so and the next gen doesn't start until Sony says so.
178000	180000	SSJ100Matt being very random in our chatroom.
180000	182000	chat.orangelandradio.com
182000	186000	Dear Nintendo, bring back the Game Boy printer.
186000	189000	Well, knowing Nintendo, maybe there will be something to attach it to later.
189000	192000	To print out your Mii or something like that.
192000	194000	RossdielUT brings up a good point.
194000	196000	EA could easily just say,
196000	200000	No Madden for the Wii unless you stop with the friend codes.
200000	201000	I don't know though.
201000	207000	Wii is selling pretty good to an audience that may not necessarily have a 360.
207000	210000	So I think you still want to get Madden out to that audience somehow.
210000	212000	I don't know.
212000	216000	Well Madden Wii is going to get some other funny features in there as well.
216000	221000	Including some mini games, Mii integration, and the ability to draw on the screen.
221000	225000	Unless you two can be just like John Madden and draw on the screen.
225000	228000	With the brand new Wii Illustrator.
228000	230000	So that's kind of funny.
230000	234000	And of course like FIFA and some of the other games that are coming out.
234000	236000	You will be able to integrate your Mii in there.
236000	238000	There are going to have a whole set of mini games.
238000	241000	Kind of similar I'm guessing to Madden 07.
241000	244000	You know, just field training and what not.
244000	249000	Okay, so you can sketch all over the board like it was real football and everything.
249000	256000	But the $64,000 question is, will you be able to write out boobs on the prompt on the little thing?
256000	257000	I think you can.
257000	259000	How very un-Nintendo like.
259000	262000	What's that explicit?
262000	267000	Then again, Nintendo is supposed to be releasing a child porn game for the DS.
267000	268000	What?
268000	269000	No, no, no.
269000	270000	That is Namco.
270000	271000	Or SNK.
271000	272000	I'm sorry.
272000	273000	SNK.
273000	278000	The only new game that they're putting out was that stupid touch the witches thing to
278000	281000	see if they're witches and you flick their boobs and shit.
281000	283000	What in the fuck are you talking about?
283000	286000	Maybe you should read some more Kotaku or something.
286000	289000	There's at least one story about this damn game.
289000	290000	Give me a break.
290000	294000	There's like 50,000 game blogs out there I'm trying to juggle.
294000	297000	It's a Japanese game where you have to find witches.
297000	301000	And the only way to find witches are to poke and prod at them on their body.
301000	304000	And one of the witches happens to be a little boy.
304000	310000	Wasn't there like a cat or something too?
310000	311000	I don't know.
311000	312000	It's just weird.
312000	315660	But yes, at one point you do touch little boys in that game, so that's weird.
315660	319000	But there's a lot of touching of women and you flick their boobs and stuff.
319000	322000	I'm poking Jamie to see if she's a witch right now, actually.
322000	327600	She's about ready to break her bottle.
327600	328600	I beard you.
328600	329600	I beard you.
329600	330600	Wow.
330600	334600	Jamie does not like to be poked and declared a witch.
334600	335600	And Madden 08 will be online.
335600	336600	We found a witch.
336600	337600	May we burn her?
337600	338600	Of course.
338600	339600	Burn the witch.
339600	345800	They're going to have a two-on-two versus mode as well for the mini-games, so that's
345800	346800	kind of cool.
346800	351320	Madden 2008, featuring hot two-on-two action.
351320	356440	So I have some happy news, like none of us didn't see this coming.
356440	361680	The Wii and the DS are outselling their Sony counterparts with a vengeance.
361680	370960	There have been 338,000 units sold in May, which is more than both the 155,000 Xbox 360s
370960	372960	and 82,000 PS3s put together.
372960	375680	Isn't that cool?
375680	377160	Not if you're a Sony fanboy.
377160	378600	You're kind of mad at this right now.
378600	382900	I mean, again, I try to be as impartial as possible, but let me say this news does not
382900	384680	surprise me.
384680	392080	Well, the top-selling game right now is Pokemon Diamond, and it actually was followed by Mario
392080	396960	Party 8 and, dear God, why anyone would want the Spider-Man 3 game, because it wasn't all
396960	400160	that good, and Pokemon Pearl.
400160	403360	And Wii Play was on number five, so isn't that cool?
403360	405360	Not really, because the game kind of blows.
405360	406360	So guess what?
406360	407360	What?
407360	411280	The same thing is happening in Japan, like any of us are surprised.
411280	418160	So dear Sony, bite our asses, not love me.
418160	420540	Someone's a little bitter over Sony right now.
420540	421540	What's up with this?
421540	423380	Why all of a sudden Sony angst?
423380	427320	You weren't swayed by anything you heard about the agency in Part A or-
427320	428320	No.
428320	429320	Okay.
429320	430320	Parappa?
430320	431320	No?
431320	432320	Silent Hill 5?
432320	433320	Parappa!
433320	436280	Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction is going to be awesome.
436280	442200	Well, one thing that apparently is not so awesome is Project Hammer, or Project H-A-M-M-E-R,
442200	443200	if you will.
443200	447120	You might remember that this game was being shown actually at last year's E3 when they
447120	448280	originally debuted the Wii.
448280	451320	In fact, they had it playable on some workstations.
451320	457080	However, some sources are reporting that Project Hammer has been canceled.
457080	459480	IGN was reporting it a little earlier this week.
459480	466520	The team has moved on supposedly to look at some more expanded audience projects, whatever
466520	469680	that is supposed to mean.
469680	472920	Hopefully it's something original no matter what it is, but there it is.
472920	476480	Nintendo, by the way, has not released an official statement, but some folks have kind
476480	480760	of seen this coming for a little while because Project Hammer went into this mysterious T-B-A
480760	486160	status on its website, and it has yet to move from that status.
486160	487160	So there you go.
487160	491920	It was supposed to be a very interesting plot where you had a hammer-wielding cyborg and
491920	495360	you're protecting the U.S. from killer robots.
495360	500160	However, as silly as it might sound, it looked like the game was actually supposed to be
500160	501160	kind of fun.
501160	503960	I watched some people play it at E3, and it definitely didn't look like anything else
503960	507200	on Nintendo's system, so it's kind of weird that they would just kind of up and up cancel
507200	511800	this game, but I guess if it sucked, good for them for pulling the plug on it before
511800	514520	they actually released it and got all the bad press, I guess.
514520	518920	I think you should have had MC Hammer do the voice for Project Hammer, because that would
518920	519920	have been so appropriate.
519920	522280	Yeah, well, you can't touch this game now.
522280	523280	It's been canceled, actually.
523280	526240	Hammer, don't let him hurt you.
526240	529400	Did either of you guys see this at E3 last year when we were all there?
529400	530400	Yeah, I remember Project Hammer.
530400	531400	You remember that?
531400	533400	I think they still had it on the website, on Nintendo's website.
533400	534400	Well, it's just a rumor.
534400	537360	It's not officially canceled, but all signs point to...
537360	538360	I don't know.
538360	543720	I know just working in the retail and distribution side, there's a lot of things that go canceled
543720	545280	for a while and come back.
545280	549760	It's just because they're not working on it right now, kind of shelving it for a while.
549760	554080	Maybe they'll just decide to release it as a downloadable title on Nintendo Live Arcade.
554080	555080	Oh, wait.
555080	556080	They don't have that.
556080	560200	Okay, the game I was talking about earlier was Doki Doki Majo Shimpan, and there's a
560200	563280	perfect example of the things that you poke in the game.
563280	564280	Pompoms?
564280	565280	Yeah, pom-poms.
565280	566280	Anyways.
566280	567280	Interesting.
567280	568280	So...
568280	573480	Thank you, Loki, for bringing down the maturity level of this show to a whole new low.
573480	574480	Appreciate it.
574480	575480	No problem.
575480	577920	Just real quick, some chat comments from chat room.
577920	581480	Rama says, Project Hammer was designed to show how much of a powerhouse the Wii is.
581480	583320	Did you see the graphics on it?
583320	584320	Interesting.
584320	589420	Yeah, it didn't look that bad, considering that the Wii just simply isn't as powerful
589420	591400	as the other systems.
591400	595040	Well, there you go.
595040	607480	Another interesting game coming out to the DS is going to have these two little kind
607480	612080	of cute stylus drum things, I guess, for it, so you're going to be able to beat the screen
612080	614480	like a taiko drum.
614480	616480	Aren't the styluses kind of already drumsticks?
616480	617480	I mean, how...
617480	622360	Yeah, but it's two of them now, so you have two of them that you can drum the screen with.
622360	624920	But your DS actually comes with two styluses.
624920	628960	They give you a spare in there, and yet you still lose these little bastards everywhere.
628960	634760	Maybe if, yeah, maybe if you're like my wife and lost, you know, the stylus, you know.
634760	635760	Whatever, who cares?
635760	638200	You get another, you get two free styluses with it.
638200	639200	That's awesome.
639200	642840	So you can play this game once, because that's what always happens with these type of games,
642840	644600	with the special peripherals and stuff.
644600	648560	Very rare, well, I guess that's not true, because DDR I've played to death, but some
648560	651000	of these other music games I play once and I'm done.
651000	656440	If you're going to be buying this in Japan, have you know the styluses aren't free.
656440	660960	They actually drove the cost of the game up about a thousand more yen, so.
660960	661960	Which is what?
661960	662960	Ten more dollars?
662960	667980	Basically is what that translates to, about ten more dollars for two extra stylus things
667980	669680	that are drumsticks, but not...
669680	670680	You just figure.
670680	671680	Yeah.
671680	672680	I know.
672680	673680	Why can't you just use your fingernails?
673680	674680	Maybe that's not good for a screen.
674680	677040	Or why can't you just use one stylus?
677040	679320	Or why not just play a real drum?
679320	683240	No, just, actually Taiko no Tatachin is kind of fun.
683240	684880	Taiko Drum Master, whatever you want to call it.
684880	688800	I don't know, but it's fun when you actually have the big old drum on it.
688800	692120	But then again, just like Donkey Konga, I played it once and then I was kind of done
692120	693120	with it.
693120	694120	So, whatever.
694120	699000	Well, you know, there is something that a bunch of us have played several times, I'm
699000	704100	sure, if we had any real video game taste, which those of us in this room do.
704100	714800	So wonderfully, it is now Europe's Virtual Console's 100th game, F-Zero X, which is like
714800	715800	freaking rad.
715800	718960	I remember playing a ton of F-Zero X.
718960	719960	You know what's funny?
719960	722600	F-Zero X is the one F-Zero game I didn't play.
722600	723600	What?
723600	724600	I know.
724600	728320	I played the one on the Super Nintendo, definitely the GameCube one, which was so underrated.
728320	729720	F-Zero X was like hotness.
729720	731240	Well, maybe they'll release it here.
731240	732560	Maybe that's a good sign that it's coming here.
732560	734840	I can come to my house and play it on my Nintendo 64.
734840	737080	You're actually going to hook that shit up just so we can play F-Zero X?
737080	738080	If I can find it, I will.
738080	739080	All right, it's a date.
739080	740320	I'll hook it up on my Nintendo 64.
740320	745000	Oh, that's right, I threw mine away in a dumpster.
745000	747080	I still have my Nintendo 64 in a box somewhere.
747080	748320	I can't find my Dreamcast, though.
748320	750800	I have all the accessories for the Dreamcast.
750800	752080	I think I'm missing a box.
752080	756480	I also have a Dreamcast sitting in a box over there that's not being used.
756480	760160	I want to use it as a Nintendo emulator.
760160	762680	Play some Guardian Legend again.
762680	765920	But of course, maybe I don't need to be using my Dreamcast as an emulator much longer.
765920	767420	Not if I get one of these.
767420	772320	You may have read about this, but there is a new Power Pack compact flash system.
772320	776120	This is pretty rad because it looks just like an old-school Nintendo cartridge, but it's
776120	778240	red and it's see-through.
778240	780500	What it is, it's a flash cartridge.
780500	785480	What you can do, you can actually store multiple ROMs on a compact flash card and then actually
785480	791240	put them on this cartridge and play pirated old-school Nintendo games to your heart's
791240	792240	content.
792240	797960	And it will only cost you $135 if you get one of these things.
797960	798960	But that's not bad.
798960	801840	I mean, for some people, that's how much they're going to spend on virtual console games when
801840	802840	you add it all up.
802840	806840	But what I love about this is they actually gave it the very retro look here.
806840	808480	They actually kind of put a little...
808480	811560	It looks like an old-school Nintendo game, if you see a picture of the box.
811560	814640	And even with this little rip-off Nintendo seal of approval there.
814640	816680	Well, it better for $135!
816680	817680	Shit!
817680	824840	Well, I mean, compact flash readers are not exactly cheap pieces of equipment and the
824840	825840	whole thing.
825840	830600	We were joking, myself and my wife were joking, because we saw another one of those iPhone
830600	832720	commercials that they have on TV.
832720	836360	This isn't just the internet for phone.
836360	838400	This isn't scaled down internet.
838400	839400	This is the real internet.
839400	843480	I'm like, it better be the fucking real internet for $600!
843480	845960	And then she's like, you should say that about every feature on it.
845960	848960	I'm like, yeah, it better fucking be for $600!
848960	850840	There's lots of people waiting for their iPhones.
850840	851840	I know this.
851840	852840	Well, shit!
852840	858760	It better be everything that they promise it will be because it's $600!
858760	870320	So apparently the AMA is debating on whether to recognize game addiction as a real addiction.
870320	872840	So yeah, they're going to be debating about it.
872840	878400	And looking at all the facts and sooner or later we will have something for someone to
878400	883620	talk about saying, hey, game addiction's real, see?
883620	885040	It's just like alcoholism.
885040	886820	It's a disease.
886820	891160	How exactly does one go about debating game addiction?
891160	893120	Fucking fine though.
893120	895120	I don't know.
895120	898880	Exploring the possible dangers of excessive video game playing that's over two hours
898880	899880	a day.
899880	901880	Would you like to have a debate?
901880	903580	Oops!
903580	910260	Would you like to have a debate about gaming addiction right now?
910260	914200	Okay, who would like to take the point there is no such thing as gaming addiction?
914200	917120	Would anyone like to take the anti-point, there is no such thing as gaming addiction?
917120	919600	Would anyone like to do that?
919600	923480	Okay, Jamie will take the anti-point, there is no such thing as gaming addiction.
923480	928980	Okay, who would like to take the pro-point, there is such thing as gaming addiction?
928980	930120	Fine.
930120	931120	You will?
931120	933120	Alright, that'll be interesting.
933120	937120	Alright, Loki will take the point that there is a such thing as gaming addiction.
937120	938120	Okay, here we go.
938120	940120	Loki, opening statement.
940120	944120	Korea, World of Warcraft, dead babies.
944120	947120	Alright, that was a very nice opening statement, thank you.
947120	949120	Dark Sakura, rebuttal to the opening statement.
949120	952120	Obsessive compulsive disorder.
952120	954120	Where are you going with this, exactly?
954120	958120	These people don't have addiction to gaming, they're obsessive compulsive.
958120	962120	And gaming just happens to be the object of their disorder.
962120	964120	Loki, rebuttal.
964120	969120	Okay, well still though, that's technically game addiction, they're addicted to games.
969120	975120	I mean, with OCD or whatever, they're not like, you know, drinking tons of alcohol.
975120	978120	They're not, you know, gambling or anything like that.
978120	981120	Gambling is also obsessive compulsive.
981120	991120	True, these are all, okay, well, I can have lung cancer or I can have cancer but it doesn't mean it's necessarily lung cancer or not necessarily, you know, from smoking or something.
991120	993120	Are you saying games give you cancer?
993120	999120	Addiction, I think, requires ingestion of a particular substance that your body eventually becomes dependent upon.
999120	1009120	Having a physical thing that you are obsessively compulsive to participate in is not the same as a physical addiction.
1009120	1017120	It's just that by doing this task over and over again, your brain chemicals are saying, hey, I like this and I want to keep doing this.
1017120	1029120	As opposed to you actually having a physical addiction to a substance that your body is starting to need to maintain a particular level of normalcy, I guess.
1029120	1033120	So you're basically saying World of Warcraft is not an injectable substance.
1033120	1034120	Right.
1034120	1035120	Rebuttal.
1035120	1041120	How many weekends have you skipped going out with friends and stuff to play World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI?
1041120	1044120	You're pointing at me and like maybe one.
1044120	1046120	Because he knows that I haven't done it.
1046120	1048120	When I was sad and fat.
1048120	1050120	If you're going to point at me or like, you know.
1050120	1053120	You're not sad anymore.
1053120	1056120	You just lost the debate, bitch, you insulted the ref.
1056120	1059120	Loki is the winner, ladies and gentlemen.
1059120	1062120	I leave it to the chat room to vote.
1062120	1063120	Chat room vote.
1063120	1065120	Remember, our opinions don't matter.
1065120	1068120	It's the chat room's vote.
1068120	1070120	Loki, anything else you wish to add, in all seriousness?
1070120	1079120	No, seriously, you know, gaming addiction as something that needs to be treated or something, that's retarded.
1079120	1083120	Fucking parents need to step in and just fucking say, stop playing your damn games.
1083120	1087120	Or if you're older, just have your girlfriend say, stop playing your damn games.
1087120	1088120	Which is what you have.
1088120	1091120	I put them on drugs for OCD.
1091120	1096120	That's how Loki curbed his gaming addiction, is he married a woman that will pull the plug on.
1096120	1099120	I still play two hours of games a day, if that, more than that.
1099120	1102120	Okay, then what's my excuse?
1102120	1111120	I was a massive gamer, married my husband, and now at heart I don't really play that much anymore except for pinball.
1111120	1113120	He still plays more than I do.
1113120	1117120	I don't care, he's welcome to as long as he leaves me alone.
1117120	1120120	Well, there's going to be another kiss with Jack Thompson about this.
1120120	1122120	Eh, eh, eh, eh, no.
1122120	1124120	He who shall not be named.
1124120	1127120	Oh, explicit hasn't been here in a year.
1127120	1129120	He doesn't know about some of our banning topics.
1129120	1132120	We do not mention his name in these circles.
1132120	1137120	That's right, it's actually codenamed Lord Voldemort, is actually what we refer to him as on the show.
1137120	1141120	So whenever you hear Lord Voldemort, that's JT, okay?
1141120	1142120	Alright, you got it.
1142120	1143120	Oh, we got explicit.
1143120	1146120	It's okay, G4 was banned too, but somebody else brought it up earlier.
1146120	1148120	Leave it to Loki to bring that up, so there you go.
1148120	1153120	There you go, GS191 sums it up.
1153120	1154120	Well, there's your cure.
1154120	1156120	Marriage cures gaming addiction.
1156120	1157120	Examples, Loki and Dark Soccer.
1157120	1158120	No, it doesn't.
1158120	1159120	I still play.
1159120	1160120	I was never addicted.
1160120	1163120	Because there's no such thing as gaming addiction.
1163120	1165120	I'm not addicted to games.
1165120	1166120	It's like this, okay?
1166120	1174120	My wife doesn't like the fact that I talk about games a lot because, well, I work in the games industry,
1174120	1183120	I play games, I do this show, so I'm talking about work, my outside stuff, what I'm doing,
1183120	1188120	and unfortunately that all comes back to games because it all has something to do with games, usually.
1188120	1191120	I talk about movies though, a lot about movies and Transformers.
1191120	1199120	But still though, it's just, I think people have addictive behavior,
1199120	1202120	but these people, if games weren't around, they'd be addicted to something else.
1202120	1208120	So whatever, just fucking be responsible people.
1208120	1210120	That's what people need to do.
1210120	1211120	All right.
1211120	1212120	It's all done.
1212120	1213120	The debate's over.
1213120	1215120	Jamie already lost because she made fun of the ref.
1215120	1219120	Rob, I do that all the time.
1219120	1220120	It's because I love you.
1220120	1221120	Yeah, yeah, whatever.
1221120	1225120	Well, here's the segment I love most of all, and it's the one where we get to hear from our listeners,
1225120	1229120	and I'm sure we've collected quite a bit of mail over the past two weeks because we had no live show last week.
1229120	1232120	So we're going to open up the mailbag, and whenever you want to email us,
1232120	1235120	you can always send an email to mailbag at orangehonestradio.com.
1235120	1239120	Dark Sakura will dive into the mailbag head first, wearing some latex gloves though,
1239120	1241120	so she doesn't get anthrax or anything,
1241120	1244120	and pull out some of her favorite emails to share with us here on the show.
1244120	1246120	We call it the OLR mailbag.
1246120	1250120	Dark Sakura, who emailed us this week?
1250120	1257120	Some people, a bunch of people, and I'm not reading all these fucking emails, so I'll just start here.
1257120	1260120	This one comes from Ospher.
1260120	1261120	Hey, it's Ospher again.
1261120	1263120	I swear I wasn't drunk, Ospher.
1263120	1265120	Hey, shush.
1265120	1271120	Since I lack a high-speed connection, I always have to go to a friend's house and wirelessly download your podcast to my PSP.
1271120	1275120	It's been a few weeks since I last listened to this show, so I downloaded all that I could up to the current podcast.
1275120	1279120	In an episode a few weeks ago, I found it hilarious that Rob called his mom.
1279120	1284120	We got to find out some things that we never knew about him, like how he dressed up as Courtney Love and lip synced.
1284120	1285120	Do we really have to bring that up again?
1285120	1289120	Good lord, you guys should find a video and upload it to the site if you can.
1289120	1292120	We are not retelling the story for your benefit explicitly.
1292120	1294120	Go download the podcast. There's still others.
1294120	1298120	One week there should be a Parents of OLR show where you all call your parents or bring them on the show.
1298120	1302120	I'm sure some more interesting things should be revealed about you guys.
1302120	1304120	Anyway, thanks for reading.
1304120	1309120	If we got my mom out here, that would be great because I want to get my mom to California.
1309120	1311120	For me, it was kind of like a one-time joke.
1311120	1313120	Sequels are never as good as the original.
1313120	1314120	It was kind of like a one-time joke.
1314120	1317120	That was the Mother's Day show, by the way, where that happened.
1317120	1319120	There you have it.
1319120	1320120	No, but that was good.
1320120	1326120	My mom did great on the show, considering she had no idea we were calling her live.
1326120	1328120	She did a great job, so I was very proud of her.
1328120	1330120	So the next email.
1330120	1332120	Dun, dun, dun.
1332120	1334120	If you're ready.
1334120	1337120	Hey, you noticed that person again, but this is great.
1337120	1342120	And now I give you ten random questions spurred from my void of boredom.
1342120	1344120	This is Ocifer again.
1344120	1346120	I still am not drunk, Ocifer, I swear.
1346120	1347120	One, freeze.
1347120	1349120	What are you all doing right now at this moment?
1349120	1350120	The fucking show?
1350120	1351120	Yeah, we're doing a radio show.
1351120	1353120	Actually, Loki is not doing a radio show.
1353120	1358120	I can clearly see, plain as day, Loki is playing on some Transformers-related website
1358120	1359120	and not paying attention to the mailbag.
1359120	1361120	Now, now, this is game-related.
1361120	1363120	This is the opening cinematic for Transformers the game.
1363120	1365120	So, huh.
1365120	1366120	And I'm paying attention.
1366120	1367120	I just got served.
1367120	1368120	Two.
1368120	1369120	Okay, you can move now.
1369120	1372120	What is the drink that helps you get up and go?
1372120	1373120	Coffee.
1373120	1374120	Tea.
1374120	1379120	Loki stacking Pepsi cans over there.
1379120	1380120	Honestly, water.
1380120	1381120	Or coffee.
1381120	1383120	If I need caffeine, coffee.
1383120	1385120	Otherwise, I drink a crap load of water.
1385120	1388120	But tonight, it's Malibu and root beer.
1388120	1391120	Which isn't as bad of a combination as you might think.
1391120	1392120	How many questions?
1392120	1394120	Wait, this is ten random questions you said?
1394120	1396120	Alright, oh boy, it's only a three-hour show.
1396120	1397120	Let's keep it moving.
1397120	1402120	What is the capital of Germany?
1402120	1403120	Wiener schnitzel.
1403120	1404120	Four.
1404120	1408120	What is your favorite song on either BeatMania 2DX or DDR?
1408120	1410120	No, the Germany question still bugging me.
1410120	1413120	It was the city that was separated for so long.
1413120	1414120	Berlin.
1414120	1415120	Berlin?
1415120	1416120	Yes, it was Berlin.
1416120	1417120	I like Berlin, the band.
1417120	1418120	On the metro.
1418120	1421120	I like Wiener schnitzel, by the way.
1421120	1422120	That's it for the questions.
1422120	1423120	Oh, that's it?
1423120	1424120	No more questions?
1424120	1425120	I'm not going to read anymore.
1425120	1429120	Dear Orange Lounge Radio, there needs to be an Oregon Trail for the DS, dammit.
1429120	1434120	I'd prefer it be based on Oregon Trail 2 engine, but considering the chances of it coming out,
1434120	1435120	I'd be happy anyways.
1435120	1437120	What are other things y'all wish for?
1437120	1440120	Perhaps even more ActRaiser for Sky, if he insists.
1440120	1444120	Also, though not related to gaming, there should be a Deadpool movie.
1444120	1445120	Yes!
1445120	1448120	Unless they royally screw it up like X-Men 3, then I'd cry forever.
1448120	1450120	That's Tim Tsurugi.
1450120	1454120	Sorry, I had to look up on Wikipedia what the capital of Germany was,
1454120	1458120	because I didn't want to look like a dumb shit anymore than I already do on the entire internet.
1458120	1459120	It is Berlin, by the way.
1459120	1462120	If they did a Deadpool movie, they'd have to get the guy that does his voice in the game,
1462120	1464120	because he was the cryptkeeper.
1466120	1468120	Sorry, what was our emailer emailing us about?
1468120	1469120	I was too busy on Wikipedia.
1469120	1472120	What else would I like to see on DS that was old-school gaming?
1472120	1475120	Besides the mandatory Guardian legend answer,
1475120	1478120	no, you know what, I don't want to see retro games on the DS.
1478120	1483120	I want to see retro games on consoles I can play on my TV, just like the old retro games.
1483120	1486120	Zero, there's nothing I want to see on DS that's retro.
1486120	1487120	MDK.
1489120	1490120	That's pretty old-school.
1491120	1494120	I think that would be fun, because I like me some MDK.
1494120	1496120	Did they ever make a sequel to MDK?
1496120	1497120	Yes, they did, unfortunately.
1497120	1499120	Insanest is yelling in chat room,
1499120	1502120	Arcon, Arcon, Arcon, over and over again.
1502120	1504120	That was a pretty awesome game, I'll give you that.
1505120	1506120	Or StarCon.
1506120	1507120	I say nothing.
1507120	1508120	Nothing.
1510120	1511120	Let's see.
1512120	1516120	This one's too long, and I'm just going to end up posting it on the forums anyway.
1517120	1518120	Okay.
1519120	1524120	I also got an email from one of the people who emailed me in French.
1525120	1528120	It says, thank you for replying to my email.
1528120	1530120	I felt like such a star when you read my letter.
1531120	1532120	I'm not used to all this.
1532120	1535120	By the way, you guys are talking about Sony a whole lot.
1535120	1538120	Thanks for making the effort, and I might have to go and pick up a Pokémon game or two.
1538120	1540120	You guys seem to really love them.
1541120	1542120	I have to be honest.
1542120	1545120	We didn't really change anything in the creation of the show.
1545120	1549120	It's just that, I guess, the weeks you were listening previous, there just was a lot of Xbox heavy news.
1549120	1555120	But right now, there's not a lot of, you know, there seems to be actually more Sony and PC news this week.
1555120	1557120	So, you know, it just depends on the flow of news.
1558120	1559120	What we cover.
1559120	1562120	By the way, that was Spamoflauge.
1563120	1564120	I love that name.
1564120	1565120	That's a pretty rad name.
1565120	1567120	And then I'm not going to read any more emails.
1568120	1570120	Are the emailers being punished?
1570120	1571120	Alright, I'll read one.
1571120	1572120	One more. Alright.
1572120	1573120	From AZHP.
1573120	1574120	Okay.
1574120	1576120	Hi guys, I was listening to your podcast on the way to class today,
1576120	1580120	and I noticed you guys talking about how Mario Party 8 backups don't work on the Wii.
1580120	1585120	As I am a college student and I back up my games so that I don't have to lug around DVD cases back and forth,
1585120	1589120	mentioning this so I don't get you guys in trouble for talking piracy.
1589120	1593120	In fact, I've also contributed to the design of a Wii mod chip for this purpose.
1593120	1596120	Anyway, I can confirm that Mario Party 8 backups work fine.
1596120	1599120	As I backed up mine, and I'm playing it as I type this.
1599120	1601120	Wow, you're talented.
1601120	1608120	What is likely the case of the misinformation on your last show is that the game does not work on PAL territory systems,
1608120	1611120	which is a relatively common problem due to the incompatible video issues.
1611120	1613120	Just wanted to clear that up, and while we're on the topic,
1613120	1617120	Nintendo has been cracking down on piracy in other ways, if not through software.
1617120	1619120	If you've gotten by a Wii now,
1619120	1624120	there's a chance that you'll get a Wii that inside has three pins on its DVD controller chip cut off.
1624120	1630120	These pins serve absolutely no purpose except to allow hackers like myself a backdoor into the system.
1630120	1632120	They're always talking about a backdoor.
1632120	1638120	I don't want to get into too much detail, but cutting the pins makes it extremely difficult to modify the console.
1638120	1641120	However, it's not going to stop anything other than casual modding
1641120	1645120	because you can find professional modders anywhere who will still take the job for 20 bucks.
1645120	1647120	That brings me to my question for you guys.
1647120	1649120	Is it possible for a company to stop piracy in its tracks?
1649120	1650120	Fuck no.
1650120	1652120	That was me, by the way.
1652120	1658120	Do you think that the funds invested in stopping piracy is greater than the potential loss incurred from allowing it to run rampant?
1658120	1661120	I'm not asking if the monetary value of the pirated goods is significant.
1661120	1663120	Obviously, it is.
1663120	1670120	However, most people who pirate wouldn't buy nearly the same amount of games as they are pirating.
1670120	1672120	So do you think it's a company's best interest to stop modding,
1672120	1676120	or do you think it's something that they do in order to appease uneducated shareholders?
1676120	1677120	That's a good question.
1677120	1681120	I think it is not in their interest, but I want to hear your two cents.
1681120	1682120	Sorry for the long email.
1682120	1683120	Hope you guys enjoyed it.
1683120	1684120	AZHB.
1684120	1685120	Okay.
1685120	1687120	I think that that's part of it, too.
1687120	1698120	The average boardroom suit and tie person is only going to look at numbers.
1698120	1705120	They're only going to look at face value good idea because, remember, once you get into upper management, you turn into a moron.
1705120	1708120	Wow, someone's jaded.
1708120	1709120	That's all right.
1709120	1710120	I understand.
1710120	1715120	I think that some of it is for, you know, face.
1715120	1722120	Some of it is, I think, they want to discourage the casual pirate.
1722120	1727120	Like, these people said, oh, I can just clip this on the back of my PlayStation, and I can play whatever, blah, blah, blah.
1727120	1730120	They want to discourage those people who don't know what the fuck they're doing.
1730120	1735120	For those of us who know what we're doing, there's not going to be any way that they can stop us if we try hard enough.
1735120	1737120	If we care enough.
1737120	1747120	Here's my thing is that, with no disrespect to the emailer, you go to all this trouble to back up games because you don't want to haul DVD cases around.
1747120	1753120	Am I really supposed to believe that?
1753120	1754120	I mean, I guess.
1754120	1755120	I guess it's possible.
1755120	1763120	It seems to me like that's, it's not that I'm saying like, oh, you're a thief or whatever, I'm just like, that seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to.
1763120	1767120	Just to not have to carry around DVD cases, which aren't that big a deal.
1767120	1779120	Better yet, if you're backing up a game, say, onto another DVD to play it on your system, aren't you still carrying around that DVD?
1779120	1782120	It's just now it's a backed up one instead of the real one?
1782120	1784120	I don't understand how that's cutting down on DVDs.
1784120	1787120	Of course, our chat room is chiming in here at chat.orangelaundry.com.
1787120	1795120	Black Wolf, our old buddy who just turned 100 today, said, we tried to stop them, but they always get by what we do.
1795120	1801120	It sounds better than, well, we won't do anything because they'll get around it anyway.
1801120	1804120	I guess that's a good point, kind of going back to the boardroom things going on in there.
1804120	1814120	NintendoManiac64 says, backing up DS and GBA games is very helpful, though, in regards to bulk and carrying things around and stuff like that.
1814120	1817120	So, there you go, some chat room feedback.
1817120	1820120	All right, any other emails?
1820120	1822120	No, well, there were, but I didn't read them.
1822120	1824120	All right, fair enough.
1824120	1832120	If you would like your emails to be judged by DarkSakura, she's judged the rest of the mailbag this week, mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
1832120	1841120	Back into some gaming news, let's talk about Halo 3, because I'm sure we're not going to be able to get from now until November and not bring up Halo 3 at least once.
1841120	1844120	This is just a really big game.
1844120	1854120	There are going to be some limited edition Halo 3 controllers and headsets coming out, and this is going to be coming out from GameStop.
1854120	1856120	At least GameStop is now listing them.
1856120	1857120	Everyone's going to have them.
1857120	1859120	Everyone's going to have them, but GameStop has kind of spilled the beans on it.
1859120	1866120	This is $59.99 for the wireless controllers, because you're going to pay $10 more because they have pretty pictures on them.
1866120	1873120	One has the Spartan, one has the Covenant, and then there is also a green headset that's going to be coming out.
1873120	1874120	I don't see the price for this one.
1874120	1877120	Oh, it's also $59.99, the wireless headset.
1877120	1885120	All it really is, it's green, and the button is orange, and it has a teeny little Halo 3 logo on it, which seems like a real waste of money.
1885120	1889120	Those are all designed by Todd McFarlane, and they also come with figurines.
1889120	1892120	Yeah, but do they really? This doesn't say anything about this.
1892120	1894120	They do come with figurines.
1894120	1897120	Oh, well that makes it a little more worth it. I don't see anything like that in here.
1897120	1898120	Is that something unsaid?
1898120	1903120	No, the controllers come with figurines. In fact, they've had a picture of the Halo 3.
1903120	1908120	I don't know if Master Chief has come in with both of them, but one of them has Master Chief.
1908120	1914120	Now, of course, even though these are limited edition, you know they're going to be everywhere when the game comes out, and they'll probably be trying to sell them when you buy the game.
1914120	1919120	You want to get a matching controller or a matching headset with your game? You want the strategy guide?
1919120	1922120	Because that's what they do. That's how they make their money.
1922120	1924120	They'll be limited, so, you know.
1924120	1926120	How limited, though? Come on.
1926120	1927120	Pretty limited.
1927120	1928120	You think?
1928120	1929120	Eh, I think so.
1929120	1936120	I got a Halo Xbox, and I'm not even that big a Halo fan. I just bought it because that's when I finally decided to buy an Xbox.
1936120	1938120	And it probably came with a free game, didn't it?
1938120	1939120	Halo, actually.
1939120	1940120	Yeah.
1940120	1942120	Hence the Halo Xbox.
1942120	1949120	Anyways, I'm not a big fan of Halo, but I am a big fan of this game.
1949120	1955120	Grand Theft Auto IV is going to be coming. They're getting a new trailer coming out on June 28th.
1955120	1958120	Yes, once again teasing us with another game trailer.
1958120	1966120	This trailer is called Looking for That Someone Special, and it's going to be released on June 28th.
1966120	1974120	So if you're itching to get some more Grand Theft Auto footage, that's when you'll be able to find some.
1974120	1977120	So, awesome! I cannot wait.
1977120	1981120	You're really excited about this Grand Theft Auto, huh?
1981120	1982120	Fuck yeah.
1982120	1986120	I'll check it out, but I don't get excited about trailers.
1986120	1989120	You're really that excited over a trailer?
1989120	1997120	Yes, because it's just like the Transformers movie. I watch every bit of stuff I can on it.
1997120	2000120	Of course now I'm going to start slowing down because I don't want to spoil anything.
2000120	2003120	Although I've already spoiled too much.
2003120	2005120	Fair enough, I suppose.
2005120	2015120	Well, something that I guess people will care about is that track and field is going to be closer to release on Xbox Live Arcade,
2015120	2019120	probably in, quote, the next month or two.
2019120	2024120	Yeah, it's track and field.
2024120	2031120	Not one of the best old school Konami games that exist, but they've had some pretty good ones lately.
2031120	2036120	Like, I like Time Pilot, Rush and Attack was kind of fun, but track and field was just like, you just would slam the-
2036120	2037120	It's making my thumbs hurt, the game.
2037120	2042120	Yeah, it's like all those old school Mario Party games where you just hit the button over and over and over again.
2042120	2043120	That's all track and field was.
2043120	2046120	One auto-fire controller will fix that.
2046120	2047120	Hell yeah.
2047120	2052120	That's why we had the turbo button on the turbo graphics. Hi.
2052120	2057120	I needed to find one of those easy achievement points. Hell yeah.
2057120	2061120	Well, maybe there'll be something to kind of get around the auto-fire or something.
2061120	2064120	You'd think they'd put something into place, but we'll see I guess.
2064120	2068120	Oh, they won't? Come on, these people are lazy when it comes to making these games.
2068120	2069120	They're just pouring it straight over.
2069120	2074120	Maybe that'll be a title that comes out. Like, you know how some weeks they've been doing two games a week lately?
2074120	2078120	Maybe that'll be kind of the B-side for the week, will be track and field.
2078120	2085120	Anyhow, Halo 2 and Shadowrun, of course, both recently came out in the new games for Windows collection.
2085120	2089120	That's Vista only, or is it?
2089120	2096120	Falling Leaf Studios has actually gone to extents to make the games XP compatible.
2096120	2101120	What the company is saying is that if you buy the games from Amazon through their links,
2101120	2105120	because you know how Amazon has that referral program where you can get money back or whatever?
2105120	2113120	Then what they will do, they will send you for free the initial release of this compatibility software that will let you run them on XP.
2113120	2118120	Here's a quote from the CEO Brian Thomason that says,
2118120	2130120	First, Microsoft claimed that it was impossible to implement DirectX 10 compatibility atop Windows XP, and now they also want us to believe that they couldn't successfully launch two DirectX 9-based titles on XP either.
2130120	2134120	We plan to expose both theories as patently false.
2134120	2140120	But now they haven't really, you know, they haven't showed this to be true yet.
2140120	2142120	This software doesn't already exist.
2142120	2146120	Supposedly this is going to come out within a few months.
2146120	2149120	So we shall see if they can expose that to work.
2149120	2151120	I would laugh if it was a huge scam.
2151120	2155120	But is it a scam? I mean, you're still getting the game for the regular price.
2155120	2159120	It's just that, you know, they got a cut of it from Amazon, so I don't know.
2159120	2161120	We'll see. Anyways.
2161120	2164120	Bandit in chat is very adamant here. He says,
2164120	2169120	It's a fake. He's 19 and is lying. He makes 10% on that shiznit.
2169120	2171120	That's true. There's really nothing they can do about it.
2171120	2174120	Somebody complained to Amazon, maybe. I don't know.
2174120	2181120	Well, I guess our usual plug for GameTap.
2181120	2183120	But anyways, this is news.
2183120	2188120	Brand new. They're a free service that they launched, I believe, last month.
2188120	2193120	They're actually now going to be expanding it, which was currently 30 games, to 40 games now.
2193120	2197120	So I guess they've got a few more people backing it.
2197120	2202120	And they've also, I guess, for the regular subscription service, they've added Psychonauts,
2202120	2207120	King of Fighters 97, Golden Axe the Duel, Art of Fighting 3, and Metal Slug 3.
2207120	2209120	Dude, Golden Axe the Duel.
2209120	2211120	I think that's pretty awesome that Psychonauts is on it.
2211120	2214120	Those are some pretty awesome games they put on there for free.
2214120	2216120	Dude, I love Golden Axe.
2216120	2221120	I don't like the first Genesis one. It makes me miss the arcade.
2221120	2225120	Golden Axe the Duel was actually one of the first Saturn games I ever played.
2225120	2227120	I keep forgetting games have a Saturn.
2227120	2231120	When I lived in Alabama, my friend wanted a Saturn so badly he imported it.
2231120	2233120	It was like the world's biggest Sega fanboy.
2233120	2234120	So he imported a Saturn.
2234120	2238120	So the first games I got to play was King of Fighters 95.
2238120	2240120	I learned the RAM cart switch.
2240120	2245120	And Golden Axe the Duel and some Gundam game that was okay.
2245120	2247120	Act deft, and our chat room is getting very excited.
2247120	2249120	King of Fighters 97 for free.
2249120	2251120	No, it's for paid accounts.
2251120	2253120	Oh, only the paid accounts for King of Fighters 97?
2253120	2254120	Those are your games for the paid accounts.
2254120	2257120	Although it may cycle through into the free games.
2257120	2258120	You never know.
2258120	2261120	There's 40 games to choose from right now for free.
2261120	2262120	Interesting.
2262120	2265120	That would suck though if you were getting really attached to a title and then they pulled
2265120	2266120	the plug on it.
2266120	2267120	But I guess that's how they make their money.
2267120	2268120	Dude, it's-
2268120	2270120	I mean, they're not in business to just give things away.
2270120	2271120	Exactly.
2271120	2273120	I guess that's true.
2273120	2280120	Well, one thing that I think our Second Life friends will enjoy, another thing to keep
2280120	2286120	you ingrained in unreality is that they are adding voice.
2286120	2296120	It's actually, from what I understand, it's at Warhead, one of the places in Second Life.
2296120	2299120	I don't play Second Life, so I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.
2299120	2300120	Me neither.
2300120	2308120	You are greeted by dancing and flying sperm and gunfire.
2308120	2309120	That sounds like Second Life.
2309120	2311120	This is even better than the flying cocks.
2311120	2315120	That is something that they should turn into a TV show.
2315120	2321120	But apparently now that's not happening anymore because they have voice chat.
2321120	2327120	So people, you can download a special version of the client and in certain places, and one
2327120	2331120	of the places is Waterhead, you can hang out and just chat with people.
2331120	2332120	Dude, you know what I can do?
2332120	2336120	I can pick up my phone and call people and chat with them if I wanted to fucking talk
2336120	2337120	to people.
2337120	2339120	I'm online for a reason.
2339120	2345120	Drewnami in chat says, it's about fucking time Second Life there has had voice for fucking
2345120	2346120	ever.
2346120	2352120	Well, there is like a competing type of thing that has had voice chat for a while.
2352120	2353120	I've heard of there before.
2353120	2355120	You remember DDR Angel when she's come on this program?
2355120	2356120	She was really into there.
2356120	2358120	It was that game she was really into.
2358120	2359120	So, huh.
2359120	2360120	Well, there you go.
2360120	2365120	I did find the Final Fantasy VII thing that they made in Second Life.
2365120	2367120	It was pretty cool.
2367120	2374120	I've always wanted to check out Second Life, but I always go back to World of Warcraft
2374120	2376120	because I have no First Life.
2376120	2379120	And I was like, oh my god, this sucks, and then deleted it.
2379120	2384120	I'm afraid that with Second Life, it would be like me and the Sims where no good can
2384120	2386120	come of this.
2386120	2388120	Can't you start a little OLR club or something?
2388120	2389120	I don't want to do that.
2389120	2393120	I guess there used to be a little all games room, but then somebody stopped paying rent
2393120	2395120	on it or whatever, so it got imploded.
2395120	2399120	Because I remember somebody sent us a picture of our little OLR logo somewhere in Second
2399120	2403120	Life, and I was like, oh, that's kind of neat.
2403120	2405120	There you have it.
2405120	2407120	So much for Second Life.
2407120	2413120	While I was bored during my first life, I was surfing on Dig, and this story was dug,
2413120	2414120	which I thought was interesting.
2414120	2419120	It's from the website toold2play.com, and the topic is about, it says, childhood gaming,
2419120	2422120	what games would you like remade?
2422120	2425120	And it just basically goes on to say, hey, we remember these games from when we were
2425120	2429120	older, from the Nintendo Entertainment System to Genesis and 3DO.
2429120	2431120	Apparently, this author remembers the 3DO.
2431120	2434120	I do not remember the 3DO.
2434120	2439120	However, this guy made a list of the top 15 games that he would like to see.
2439120	2443120	It's by Code Monkey is the guy's name who wrote this.
2443120	2444120	It's 15 games.
2444120	2449120	It goes all the way from Red Baron on the PC, Shadow Gate was number two, WWF Wrestling
2449120	2454120	the arcade game number three, River City Ransom number four, and number five was Maniac Mansion
2454120	2460120	all the way down through Ikari Warriors, number 15 on the NES, just talking about how he would
2460120	2462120	like to see these kind of redesigned.
2462120	2465120	Well, Maniac Mansion has a sequel.
2465120	2470120	I thought it did, but these games, all these series kind of died a long time ago.
2470120	2472120	I guess.
2472120	2476120	And he says he remembers Zelda, but he can't really say Zelda because Zelda's not really
2476120	2477120	dead.
2477120	2481120	I'm just kidding, but these series are all kind of dead.
2481120	2484120	Ross Steel UT in chat says Crystalis.
2484120	2485120	That's a good pick.
2485120	2486120	That was a good game.
2486120	2488120	I also like from this list 11 RC program.
2488120	2492120	You know I can't get through this segment without saying Guardian Legend.
2492120	2494120	It's a must.
2494120	2495120	What other old school game?
2495120	2496120	How about Star Tropics?
2496120	2498120	What the hell ever happened to Star Tropics?
2498120	2500120	I'm surprised I haven't made it to Virtual Console yet.
2500120	2506120	I'm surprised too, and I'm surprised that the, what was the kid's name in Star Tropics?
2506120	2509120	There is a perfect character for Smash Brothers at some point.
2509120	2511120	If I can remember, God, why can't I remember the kid's name?
2511120	2515120	The only bad thing though about that is going to be the fact that you have to dip that manual
2515120	2516120	in water.
2516120	2517120	Was it Mikey?
2517120	2519120	I think it was Mikey or Mike or something.
2519120	2520120	Mikey I think was Goonies too.
2520120	2521120	He had a really generic name.
2521120	2526120	Mikey was Goonies too, and it was Zeb or Zeke or something that was a bad guy.
2526120	2529120	There you go.
2529120	2533120	Anyways, so we talked a little bit about MAME earlier.
2533120	2542120	Now, one of the boards for, actually the Capcom CPS3 arcade board has slightly been cracked.
2542120	2546120	They've gotten some of the code to run from the boards, and sooner or later they're going
2546120	2551120	to have the whole board emulated, and of course, that means that some games that you might
2551120	2558120	like will be able to be played, such as Jojo's Venture, Street Fighter III, and Red Earth.
2558120	2560120	I thought you said games I like would be playable.
2560120	2562120	Well, Street Fighter III is not bad.
2562120	2563120	It isn't.
2563120	2566120	It wasn't that bad.
2566120	2571120	It was no Street Fighter II or, I never really got into Street Fighter III.
2571120	2574120	Maybe I'm not giving you enough credit, but I didn't care for it.
2574120	2577120	I had my one moment of glory in Street Fighter III.
2577120	2578120	Yeah, I had a moment.
2578120	2579120	Maybe not a moment of glory.
2579120	2581120	No, I played it a lot, but I had my moment of glory.
2581120	2586120	Street Fighter III and I went out on a date, but we just didn't get along, and it wouldn't
2586120	2589120	put out, so I had to say goodbye.
2589120	2591120	There you have it.
2591120	2592120	But I guess that's cool.
2592120	2597120	For all you folks that like to pirate tons and tons of arcade games and play them on
2597120	2601120	MAME, that's great news for you guys, so congratulations.
2601120	2610120	Well, here's an interesting thing that's being advertised for GameStop.com, is a Wii Blaster
2610120	2619120	available June 27th, like pew, pew, pew lasers, I guess, but it's on one of their flyers that
2619120	2623120	it will be available, like I said, on the 27th.
2623120	2625120	I guess to go out with...
2625120	2630120	What game's coming out on Wii that's going to require a gun, maybe?
2630120	2632120	Well, there's Chicken Shoot.
2632120	2633120	Oh, yay!
2633120	2634120	Chicken Shoot!
2634120	2640120	Hey, I guess you may be able to use it for maybe Resident Evil 4.
2640120	2648120	Well, later on, back when we get into the fall, Chronicles and Ghost Squad, I don't know.
2648120	2649120	But why do we need this yet?
2649120	2651120	Maybe Duck Hunt on Virtual Console.
2651120	2652120	Duck Hunt!
2652120	2656120	Or better yet, this is just a piece of useless crap that they're trying to push on you.
2656120	2661120	Or how about this, better yet, why don't Nintendo do what Nintendo does best and hold out on
2661120	2668120	the good stuff, so instead of giving us Duck Hunt, why don't you give us Wild Gunman, which
2668120	2670120	if you've ever played Wild Gunman...
2670120	2672120	Maybe we'll get Blastress.
2672120	2674120	There was seriously nothing to Wild Gunman.
2674120	2677120	It was who can pull the trigger faster when the thing says go.
2677120	2683120	They made an entire video game and sold this for a lot of money, an entire game out of
2683120	2687120	who can push the button first was the game.
2687120	2692120	So you'll probably see that on Virtual Console, and then you'll get such brilliant classics
2692120	2693120	like Hogan's Alley.
2693120	2698120	But then, and only then, will Nintendo finally deliver the Duck Hunt.
2698120	2704120	Well, what this basically does is just allows you to attach your remote and nunchuck to
2704120	2706120	one device to turn into a shotgun thing.
2706120	2710120	Although the Wii Blaster is not going to be the only device to come out, actually at the
2710120	2716120	same time, Joytech is going to be releasing the Wii Sharpshooter, not quite as orange
2716120	2719120	as the other one, but accomplishes the same thing.
2719120	2725120	Basically puts your Wii nunchuck kind of in the pistol grip area and then the remote on
2725120	2726120	top.
2726120	2729120	To be honest, both of these are completely useless.
2729120	2734120	It's not the Wii kind of shotgun thing that you saw at E3.
2734120	2736120	This is something completely different.
2736120	2739120	It does not enhance your gameplay at all.
2739120	2743120	Frisbee in Chad reminds us about something related to Wild Gunman.
2743120	2746120	Frisbee says, a Wild Gunman was good on WarioWare Game Boy Advance.
2746120	2748120	I totally forgot that it was in that game.
2748120	2751120	But yeah, there was many references to Wild Gunman in there.
2751120	2752120	Interesting.
2752120	2755120	I don't know, is this a peripheral you're interested in getting, Jamie?
2755120	2757120	I know you like to collect everything related to games.
2757120	2759120	That's how I thought.
2759120	2760120	Me too.
2760120	2761120	Me too.
2761120	2762120	Maybe if we get a point blank.
2762120	2765120	Seriously though, there was one- Point blank Wii might sell me on it.
2765120	2769120	I don't remember what it was called, but there is one peripheral out there that looks
2769120	2771120	like it might actually be some good.
2771120	2775120	It was a thing that looked kind of like a pistol and you actually put your remote into
2775120	2778120	the pistol and the trigger on the pistol would hit the B button.
2778120	2783120	So that does change it a little bit and then that way the nunchuck's just kind of independent
2783120	2785120	from that and you just hold that in your other hand.
2785120	2787120	So that's more of something that you would probably be looking for.
2787120	2792120	This thing is just attaching the remote and nunchuck together, which will probably allow
2792120	2795120	you not to play certain games if you were to actually do that.
2795120	2796120	So it's a waste of money.
2796120	2799120	It's just like those fucking sports attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.
2799120	2803120	Have you ever seen the attachments, and I see the surprise all the time, that look like
2803120	2805120	a tennis racket and a baseball bat?
2805120	2806120	Exactly what I was talking about.
2806120	2808120	Boy, does that stuff look crappy.
2808120	2813120	Seriously, somebody is selling shaped plastic for lots of money.
2813120	2815120	Yeah, because people are dumb and will buy it.
2815120	2817120	Yeah, exactly.
2817120	2821120	I was like, dude, remember the consumer market?
2821120	2822120	Stupid.
2822120	2824120	Make stuff stupid people will want.
2824120	2829120	Maybe having one of these plastic things shaped like a tennis racket will help you win the
2829120	2833120	first organized Wii tennis tournament that any of us know of.
2833120	2835120	It's called Wimbledon.
2835120	2836120	Get it?
2836120	2837120	Instead of Wimbledon.
2837120	2839120	Wimbledon.
2839120	2843120	It's being held June 23rd at Barcade, which is in Brooklyn.
2843120	2844120	I was just there.
2844120	2845120	It's pretty awesome.
2845120	2846120	Barcade is pretty cool.
2846120	2849120	I should have gone to Barcade.
2849120	2850120	I knew of that place.
2850120	2852120	I knew it was in Brooklyn.
2852120	2854120	I was fucking in Brooklyn just a week ago.
2854120	2856120	I didn't even think to go to this place.
2856120	2857120	Oh well.
2857120	2860120	Here's a quote from the official site for Wimbledon.
2860120	2864120	Wimbledon is a Wii tennis tournament being held on June 23rd, that's next Saturday,
2864120	2869120	from noon until 5 p.m. at Barcade in Brooklyn, specifically Williamsburg.
2869120	2874120	There will be singles and doubles tournaments, prizes and beer, maybe even some strawberries
2874120	2875120	and cream.
2875120	2877120	Oh, and cucumber sandwiches.
2877120	2878120	Okay.
2878120	2881120	I guess that's a joke about Wimbledon that I don't get.
2881120	2882120	I don't know.
2882120	2883120	Okay.
2883120	2887120	I don't watch tennis on TV or anything, but I like Wii tennis.
2887120	2888120	It's kind of fun.
2888120	2889120	Yeah.
2889120	2891120	I know it's not real tennis, but there you go.
2891120	2895120	I was just thinking those plastic attachments for the Wii and stuff.
2895120	2898120	You know people have trouble as it is holding onto the Wiimote.
2898120	2902120	Can you imagine that with the chunk of plastic flying towards your TV?
2902120	2906120	Talk about some serious damage right there.
2906120	2908120	Wow.
2908120	2910120	Anywho.
2910120	2912120	So yeah, you want to get scared?
2912120	2914120	Well, here's your chance.
2914120	2918120	WifeSwap is looking for gamers to be on their show.
2918120	2920120	Wait, like the TV show?
2920120	2921120	Yes, like the TV show.
2921120	2924120	Wasn't that the one that had my favorite lady ever?
2924120	2926120	Yes, the God Warrior.
2926120	2927120	I fucking love her.
2927120	2929120	She's the best thing ever.
2929120	2936120	So yeah, so apparently you can possibly, if you're picked, you and another family will
2936120	2942120	swap wives and have the chance to earn $20,000.
2942120	2946120	I'm guessing you're going to get someone that hates video games coming to your family
2946120	2947120	if you're a gamer.
2947120	2950120	Oh my God, Nellie would be perfect for this program.
2950120	2952120	Yeah, but we don't have a kid.
2952120	2957120	They said two parents and at least one child, six or older.
2957120	2961120	So unless we can adopt someone really quick, I don't think that's going to happen.
2961120	2964120	Can you imagine if Jamie went on this program?
2964120	2966120	I want no money.
2966120	2967120	I want nothing.
2967120	2969120	I want my God and I want my family.
2969120	2972120	She's tampering and doubts that it's stuff.
2972120	2974120	She's not a Christian.
2974120	2977120	Yes, you could have that in your house, Jamie.
2977120	2979120	Wouldn't that be exciting?
2979120	2983120	I'll kill whoever.
2983120	2990120	I'll kill them to death with a spork.
2990120	2995120	Rama in chat says, you know, if Dark Sakura had a kid, this would be perfect.
2995120	2999120	I think Loki would be a good candidate for this show too.
2999120	3001120	I don't plan on breeding.
3001120	3004120	Anyways, I thought you were going to have a kid named Error.
3004120	3005120	No.
3005120	3012120	If you are interested and you qualify, you know, have a child that's six years or older,
3012120	3019120	if you're interested, you want to email jodyfriedman at rdfusa.com.
3019120	3021120	You know, just send her a letter to say hello.
3021120	3025120	Why don't you send her an email and say, hi, what's up, babe?
3025120	3031120	Or just go to abc.go.com slash primetime slash wife swap.
3031120	3035120	I hope one of our listeners gets to do this, that would be far too exciting.
3035120	3037120	You should borrow a kid.
3037120	3038120	I wish I could.
3038120	3041120	Rama says that was actually trading spouses.
3041120	3045120	The Fox version of the show was the God Warrior lady.
3045120	3047120	The clip that I played was trading spouses.
3047120	3051120	Wife Swap is the ABC version of the same fucking show.
3051120	3052120	Yeah.
3052120	3053120	Okay.
3053120	3055120	Kind of like Super Nanny and Nanny 911.
3055120	3057120	Same fucking show, two different networks.
3057120	3060120	You should rent a child.
3060120	3064120	Yeah, you could borrow a child for like two weeks.
3064120	3067120	I might see if a coworker has one you can borrow.
3067120	3068120	No.
3068120	3072120	Besides, I'd get some crazy bitch in my house throwing my shit away.
3072120	3076120	I don't need anyone to be doing that shit.
3076120	3080120	Or actually, no, that's right, I would be there.
3080120	3083120	So I would be able to monitor where she throws shit away.
3083120	3084120	No more playing games.
3084120	3089120	Fine, I can do that, you stupid whore.
3089120	3092120	And you know they're going to get some World of Warcraft addict on the show.
3092120	3095120	And you get some smart ass kid that obviously it's not your kid or whatever.
3095120	3097120	Yeah, that's my eight-year-old child.
3097120	3102120	They're going to get some fucking World of Warcraft addict who's going to start twitching
3102120	3104120	the minute they're missing a Tuesday night raid.
3104120	3107120	They're going to start going into, like, and they're going to put him in like an Amish
3107120	3110120	house and he's going to go, oh, actually no, wait, it's Wife Swap, huh?
3110120	3113120	They're not going to put him, yeah, he's just going to stay there.
3113120	3115120	They should get a wife that's more addicted than him.
3115120	3119440	Yeah, they should get it well or whatever never mind. I guess it's not husband swap
3119840	3122200	I'm just gonna shut up and let the callers do the
3122720	3125800	Doing now if you want to be funny if you want to yeah
3125800	3130640	Please be more funny than I am if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAMEOLR
3130640	3134040	Let you sleep with the new wife unless she's ugly in which case you wouldn't want to touch that shit
3134040	3135400	You're horrible
3135400	3141280	1-877-GAMEOLR let's go to the phones or orange launch radio on Skype. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
3141280	3147040	Luke it's a Nintendo maniac 64. Hello Nintendo. Hi 64. What's on your mind?
3149600	3153720	Oh right now I just gotta ask one little random question
3153880	3161040	Do you know of anyone who actually doesn't use Windows XP or Vista other than like Mac and Linux and stuff?
3162280	3169920	Like who uses something older if you will use any I mean like someone like me who's like a diehard Windows 2k addict
3169920	3173600	I like fanboy. Yes. I know people who use a
3175400	3176760	Palm OS
3176760	3179360	I know people who still are on Windows 98
3179640	3185960	Because they just don't feel like upgrading because all they use is the internet like my people who are still on Windows 3.11
3186360	3192640	My my dad uses Windows ME, and I have no idea why but he does I know I'm compare downstairs
3192640	3198520	It still works with 3.11. That's PC. I'm on right now is 98. How do you out of curiosity? Why do you ask?
3198520	3204240	Yeah, I was just wondering since I don't know I never like people say like on the internet
3204240	3209280	how like Vista was fucking like stick with XP. I always commented and saying like
3210240	3218240	2k woohoo, let's bloat. I had to have my computer replaced because my husband decided he was gonna be nice and upgrade my
3218280	3220280	computer from
3220680	3222680	Windows 2000 to
3222680	3226920	Um XP and my computer upgrading I
3227720	3233320	Like I said he thought that he was upgrading and it turned out that it completely fucked over my system
3233320	3238080	I ended up having to have it anyway because I bought a vio now my vio is starting to die
3238080	3242040	And I'm just so sad about the day that I would have to get a new computer with Vista on it
3242720	3248560	Well, I have to ask another question. Okay. Well, it was in the first part of maybe was like wait second
3248560	3254640	I mean when you guys like start talking like it was something like there was a bunch of anime coming to something and then look you
3254640	3259400	Started going raving about how awesome Akira was. Okay. Well, what's the anime for?
3259400	3263360	Like is it coming to something Xbox Live Arcade their movies?
3263360	3269800	Oh Xbox Live Mark video marketplace like well same fucking thing. We the Xbox Live. I don't 360
3269800	3275480	Yeah, it's actually already there right now. So okay and third off. Okay. I gotta have a mini rant
3275480	3280280	All right, make it quick distance ball, man. I played it at friend's house
3280840	3283940	They had cut the custom controls. It's like
3284640	3289480	Half you can't map the weapon cycle to X or O
3289880	3294040	what the crap and you can't map it so that you can have turning and
3294520	3298320	Moving forward and back on the same analog stick since I grew up in Goldeneye and stuff
3298320	3302440	That was the folk control scene and it's drilled in my head. I gotta do that and
3302440	3305960	It won't even let me change the individual axes
3305960	3312460	But what the heck boo in general the games that don't let you change the button configuration or whatever you like no matter what it
3312460	3316080	Is well, the thing is it did let me change the buttons themselves
3316600	3321380	Except that it wouldn't let me put weapon cycle on to X or O
3321720	3327240	That's strange ones all over the place. I haven't played resistance. You guys have played it more than I have
3327240	3331840	Is there's only one button for weapon cycle and it's I think because?
3332800	3336520	Well, all the buttons are analog I guess but for whatever reason
3336520	3341080	I don't know the it's the r2 button is the one you do for weapon cycle you tap it
3341080	3344720	Then I'll switch to the next one or you hold it down and it'll allow you to switch which one you want
3344720	3350060	I don't know. I love the it seemed pretty straightforward to me. I just kept it on the default stuff
3350060	3355220	So I like them actually Oh kind of like we're it'd be like on the a button like the GameCube in 64
3355220	3361900	Like going after example, where's the next one? Just keep hitting a it's like eventually find whatever weapon you're looking for
3361900	3366760	I suppose it's similar to like when I go when it well a couple years ago when I would go back and forth between
3366940	3369060	fantasy star and Final Fantasy 11
3369100	3371540	They had the camera on completely different
3371860	3374820	Axises so that like when I went up and down and stuff
3374820	3378720	He would like totally mess with my head because it was all messed up there
3379660	3381820	All right. Well Nintendo mini x64
3381820	3386560	Thanks so much for the call and hope you can get used to the controls in the game the way they are
3386700	3392060	Yeah, well, I don't the ps3 so that's perfectly fine. Well more incentive for me not to get one
3392060	3394060	You got it. So never mind then have fun
3394380	3396380	Three Sony back by
3396780	3399700	All right, if you would like to give us a call, it's a
3400820	3408540	Orange lounge radio on skype or one eight seven seven game. Oh LR more phone calls. Hi. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
3408540	3414700	Ravens dolphin. Well, hello Ravens dolphin. What's on your mind my friend? Why do you sound analog?
3414700	3418820	I hate Skype 2.5. You sound like you're on like an old-fashioned phone
3418820	3423500	I'm sorry you you kind of sound a little weird too, but whatever. We'll just have to deal what's on your mind
3423660	3429100	It's the 2.5 thing. I'm sorry. It's all right. At least you're not breaking up or whatever. What's on your mind?
3429580	3436660	Yeah, it's much clearer, but that sucks. Oh, sorry for going on that little rant Mortal Kombat for we I was so tempted to buy
3436660	3438660	This the other day, but I didn't what about it. I
3439460	3443580	Played it and I got to tell you something. It's a good Mortal Kombat game
3443580	3448200	I was actually surprised that they did the wiimote thing very well
3448500	3455500	Is it easy to control because that's the thing that holds me back. Oh, yeah. Oh hell yeah, really super easy
3456220	3458300	It is a little one here. How easy yeah
3459380	3463860	B you press on the B button and you like move it like a half moon up and down
3463860	3469740	left and right and you do like the scorpion get over here real easy you get to do and
3470340	3476940	Fatalities are just super easy. You know what I do with set fatalities. You just hold the button and swing it all around see what happens
3477860	3479460	Something like that you swing it
3479460	3483380	I could kind of like you're you have you have your you swing it and then you press the little
3483780	3486780	Directional pad and it will do a fatality. That's how easy it is
3488540	3492460	That sounds pretty funny, how do you move the guy around the screen you just use the control pad on the wiimote
3492460	3496580	Yeah, you just use the little nunchuck and it just moves around
3497380	3500900	Durr you have the nunchuck. I may say I guess I will check it out at some point
3500900	3506280	I'm just a little bummed. It doesn't have online play because Nintendo is holding out for whatever reason so
3506900	3508860	jerks
3508860	3510980	Can I just rant about the new Skype on?
3511780	3513460	the new Skype
3513460	3520320	Yeah, 2.5. It has this really annoying ring thing and it gets in your ear. It's like this is Rob ring this sucks
3520320	3527520	Yeah, that's just my voice that you're hearing that has nothing to do with Skype back to games back to games one more thing
3528280	3532960	Yes, one more thing. You got a black DS. I sure did a black DS light
3532960	3537520	I was so close to getting the pink one, but then I decided that next time I go to New York
3537520	3543040	Hopefully the engraving machine will be working and I can get an engraved and engraving show up much better on the black DS than
3543040	3544320	It does on any of the other colors
3544320	3546320	So I in the end I went for the black DS
3546320	3552540	What I do want to get though is I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get the little pink case with the sparkling little bling on it
3552540	3554540	that's what I'm gonna get to have my
3554760	3556760	princess peach homage
3557160	3560520	I'm so happy for you. I got a black one too, and I love it
3561480	3564400	Yes, and I actually hear the black ones are usually bigger
3565960	3569240	So I hear yeah, all right, but that's just a rumor all right
3569800	3575560	Anything else you anything else you want to add Raven Sullivan don't download 2.5. It sucks all right
3575560	3579060	I won't I'll hold out on the current Skype. I have see you later, Raven Sullivan. Bye
3579760	3585960	If you'd like to give us a call the username is the orange launch radio on Skype or one eight seven seven game. Ol are
3588020	3590020	Hello you're on orange launch radio, who's this
3595160	3600520	It sounds like do you like put this on auto dial or something and then when we finally pick up you like jump for
3600520	3602520	The microphone like oh shit
3602520	3608840	Don't you I just I just use brute force. I just say you know hammer the line guilty of that. Yeah, that's all right
3608840	3611600	What's on your mind? It was good to see you this weekend Zaku by the way. Thanks for coming out
3612080	3616220	Yeah, you missed our trip. You missed our trip to Astor place in the video game store
3616220	3620880	That's what we did after I know I had to play distorted. You know oh, yeah, just came out then I
3621400	3624000	Had him out there. It's all good buddy. What's on your mind?
3625000	3627000	Let me see you already know that
3627000	3634760	Rock star is basically you know shifting more on to the Microsoft side now that they confirmed exclusive stuff for granted title for
3635560	3639760	Basically dispelling all this you know any chances of it showing up on the ps3 at all
3641320	3647400	Yeah, I've heard right and they and they had the Gulf to say that the ps3 version would move consoles
3647400	3654800	Which is just a load of it's a load of bullshit because if there's nothing beyond the regular game that the ps3 folks could
3654800	3659120	Okay, you know can can attain then what's the point of actually playing it?
3659600	3662280	Well actually was it this is granted thought of for
3662800	3668240	Yeah, rock star confirmed it in there in the shareholders meeting it will move consoles because well
3668240	3671440	Oh wait, they don't have the episodic content either. Yes there we go
3671680	3675760	That's exactly and Microsoft paid a good 50 million dollars to keep it on their side
3675760	3679060	I think I'll just move consoles both for 360 and ps3
3679060	3684320	How could you how could you move consoles when one side doesn't have anything beyond the gameplay?
3684320	3688000	That's what that's what that's what I'm trying to get across to you
3688200	3692600	We have the 360 which has the ability to go beyond the regular game
3692600	3698040	You know in terms of multiplayer and exclusive content and the ps3 can't even do that yet
3698360	3703160	So you will you weigh both of them and you see the 360 has more value
3703440	3710740	Than the than the ps3 for the same price or maybe we should just take this literally and this is gonna reveal a brand new
3710740	3717220	Console rumble feature, you know, that'll actually rumble the console when the games played, you know, well, that's that
3717780	3723500	As yet to be seen but the bottom line is this rock stars basically leaning towards the side of you know
3723500	3729720	It's basically the carrot in the stick the carrot, you know the stick being Microsoft the carrot being the money
3730100	3733860	So you have to they're looking at the numbers right now, and they're trying to get to you know
3733860	3740740	What's this about a stick and a carrot? I've seen the 360 is something that you know, they'll make a lot more money than
3741260	3745580	The ps3 they just you know, I guess that's how the way it goes. I
3746980	3750640	Guess so, I guess that's the way it goes. I just heard stick and a carrot
3751660	3755060	Well, yeah, because you know Microsoft being the you know
3756540	3761220	Microsoft being the the stick and then the carrot being the money. Hey dark Sakura
3761220	3764600	What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?
3766740	3768460	My ass
3768460	3769860	All right
3769860	3771300	What?
3771300	3776380	Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference. I haven't seen you are a loser. All right. Sorry Zaku. I'm sorry
3776380	3780620	I couldn't keep everybody on topic. But mm-hmm granted. I just I'm yeah
3780620	3783900	I don't want to debate the Sony Microsoft thing anymore, you know
3783900	3786540	You have to look at but you have to look at the writing on the wall
3786540	3792540	The rock stars basically is gonna start you're just gonna have to start leaning towards one one side over another
3793700	3797020	Regardless of you know, regardless of what's already been done in the past
3797020	3801900	It's and by extending the game beyond beyond the disc Zaku
3802300	3804300	It's just a crazy cycle
3804300	3808540	The companies are gonna release the game on the console that has the most
3808840	3813540	Number of machines in the market but the company's console that's gonna have the most number of machines in the market
3813540	3817320	It's gonna be the one that has the good games on it. So it all comes down to first-party games
3817540	3819540	It all comes down to the first-party games
3820220	3824460	Exactly. Rockstar knows that 360 has a bigger install base in the ps3
3824980	3828620	that it granted that the the 360 had a one-year head start and
3829260	3832060	You know, they didn't they didn't blow they didn't take it for granted
3832980	3836500	So yeah, this is good. You know, it's just that they're saying, you know
3836500	3842860	Rockstar is just bullshitting when they're saying that their version their ps3 version of GTA 4 is actually going to move consoles
3842860	3849740	We shall see what happens. It's just it it doesn't make sense. All right. Well, thank you very much for the call Zaku
3849740	3852340	We gotta get some more calls. Mm-hmm. Bye. Bye. All right
3853820	3856560	Orange launch radio on Skype one eight seven seven game
3856780	3863060	Olr some comments from chat room GS 191 says shit at the end of the day take to interactive is gonna make a shit ton
3863060	3866620	Of money anyway, you know to buy their stock before grand theft auto for release
3866620	3870900	I hope the game tanks just to piss you all off. I don't care of it tanks
3870900	3876580	I don't give a shit about their stocks. It's gonna be awesome. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this? Hello. This is dr. Nah
3876740	3878780	Hi, dr. Nah, what's on your mind?
3878780	3885460	I just wanted to prove to all the other guys listening that you can actually get a call in if you try hard enough
3885460	3889700	That's right. You just gotta hammering the line and you can get in. Well, I'm glad I'm glad you got it
3889700	3891700	You have you called her show before?
3891780	3893220	No
3893220	3900260	Never. Well, I just thought this is my second show listening live from Mexico City. Oh, well, welcome
3900260	3905260	We like the world listeners. That's always fun house house house things going in Mexico City
3905260	3907780	How's the gaming scene in a place like Mexico City?
3908380	3913940	well, it's pretty much like Southern California which where I've been a ton of times and
3915020	3921500	Pretty much. All you have to do is get a lot of games and there's really not that many people playing live
3921500	3924660	I'd have to play with a bunch of guys from the u.s. So
3925740	3927300	That's why I'm here
3927300	3931340	There you go. Well, hey you meet a lot of a lot of folks here like to play with folks around the world
3931340	3935540	It's good times. What what type of games have you been playing recently? Oh
3936900	3943660	Sadly not the kind of game that I like. I like role-playing games, but there's not that many more out there
3944380	3949820	So right now I'm pretty much playing shoot-em-ups. So the shadow runs in my latest failure
3950420	3955100	You like me must be more excited about eternal Sonata than Halo 3
3955100	3959660	Very much. So yeah, exactly right. What else did you want to comment on tonight, buddy?
3960020	3967300	Well, just letting all the other listeners know for life that I just would not trade my spouse on any
3968220	3970220	on any TV show
3971900	3973900	Are you actually married I
3974220	3977540	Married, I have a couple of kids. So it's a pretty interesting gaming scene
3977540	3981300	Well, I fortunately I don't think you could apply for the show because the whole you know
3981300	3984260	You're in another country and I think that that brings a whole nother issue into it
3984260	3986260	But you're saying you wouldn't trade your right wife for anything
3987500	3989060	No, and
3989060	3991260	That's already given since
3991940	3998020	Both my kids are starting into video games and there are only three and five. So what kind of games are you letting the kids play?
3999020	4002140	Mostly we I got him a we and I have a bunch of games
4002780	4008220	For kids basically anything rated E. I have Shrek I have
4008220	4014700	Monster Saint that kind of games, you know, um, there was this guy I ran into at Fry's the other day
4014700	4019620	And he was looking he was looking at the Wii games and he overheard myself and I think Shane talking to each other
4019780	4023420	About the different games and he could tell that we kind of you know knew stuff about games
4023460	4028300	So he actually came up and asked me he's like what would be a good Wii game for me to get for the family
4028300	4032660	I'm like, well who's playing the Wii you or the kids and he said kind of something for all of us
4032700	4037860	So I recommended Ella bits and worry aware. Was that a good suggestion? I don't know
4037860	4040660	I couldn't think because at first I said well Zelda's the best game on the Wii
4040660	4046260	But I don't know if young kids would really get into that so much. So I said Ella bits and worry aware
4047060	4048820	Warrior where is good?
4048820	4050820	Excite truck. Yeah
4051580	4052740	Yeah
4052740	4058340	By cities, that's your suggestion right Loki. I don't know what they don't have by city on the Wii
4059700	4061700	It's our face Godfather
4061700	4066700	No, Scarfy no trauma center get them started on the path to surgery early
4066700	4069380	I said trauma centers a really fun game, but I don't think kids
4069380	4072620	I like I just like watching the patients bleed because I'm no good at it
4073620	4078180	But you know, it's funny. You said you wouldn't trade your wife for anything. I wouldn't inflict my husband on anyone else
4080020	4084780	That's nice, there you go. Well, dr. Nard thanks so much for calling in
4084780	4089220	We appreciate hearing from you and I don't know if they celebrated in Mexico, but Happy Father's Day. Nonetheless
4089220	4091460	Thank you. That's it. All right
4092460	4097100	All right. See you later. Take care. Thanks for calling. Bye. Bye. Bye
4098100	4101300	JV Mon's yelling at me in chat 1 8 7 7 game. Oh LR
4101300	4104340	We have time for a couple more calls JV Mon's yelling at me in chat saying
4105460	4107460	awesome in JV, huh
4110700	4116500	Zelda is so not the best game on the Wii. Zelda was so boring boring ass gameplay and JV Mon says sky
4116500	4121020	I'm always yelling at you, which is true, but he bought me dinner in New York. So all is forgiven
4121780	4125580	If you go meet the listeners, they'll buy you things. It's awesome
4126380	4128380	I don't think they can spend that much money
4130500	4133580	No, I can't what do I do I look like I'm made of money you make more than I do
4133580	4138520	I can bear whatever I can barely afford my own plenty. I've debt make your make your work pay for me to go
4139780	4144100	Sure, I'll do that. I'll do just that. Let's go to the phones and take at least one more call here
4144100	4150220	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this? Hey guys, it's insane. Hello
4151660	4155300	I'm going insane. Just be thinking about you. What's on your mind, buddy?
4156940	4164620	Nothing you may all notice that I found a lot like and then when I'm not DMN, okay, so the very output
4165620	4169700	Jamie took a ps3 and wasn't him to death. It was a horrible funeral
4169700	4178220	So you have officially retired or killed off DMN and now we have insane us. That's dead. Okay. Yes, I have I
4179340	4183180	That's your prerogative. You know Madonna wants everybody to call her Esther
4184340	4187400	You have every right and Prince wanted everybody to call him. I'd symbols
4191180	4193460	In Prince's a defense
4193460	4200820	And it was had to do with the fact that his previous label owned the name Prince so use the symbol in terms of protest
4200820	4205580	Until the contract goes up and could get his thing again. Has this show really come to discussing Prince?
4206780	4208780	That's a new album
4209860	4216100	Crocheted assless pants and that's bravery. This is what it sounds like when I cry anyways
4217580	4220420	Rob you need to explain something to your listeners, okay?
4220420	4225860	That you're not doing orange on his radio anymore. I'm looking at this press release from CBS right here
4226860	4229340	And apparently you're the new host of the price is right. I
4231500	4238300	Freaking wish but unfortunately, I was here. No, no, let me let me let me read let me read this
4239820	4241820	according to two years of
4242860	4248220	Auditions tryouts and everything we have selected Rob Roberts as to be the new host of the price is right
4248220	4252980	His audition tape said it all he showed so much emotion when doing his tapes audition
4252980	4258260	In fact half of the five-minute tape was him crying because he was so nervous of doing this
4258500	4265100	we think that this emotion will show will show perfectly or the new host of the price is right and
4267020	4273700	We will have somebody more feminine than marker duties, I I don't know what to say insanest but
4273700	4278700	A Plinko just moves me to tears. I'm
4280860	4286740	Actually calling to raise some beef over the Church of England versus Sony
4288140	4290660	Sorry, I'm just a little bit of a price is right
4291860	4293860	bastard religion
4295020	4297020	Wait, let's get into the music you listen
4297020	4299020	See
4303140	4308500	I wanted to turn the price is right into a gay rave. That's why I was not allowed to host it sadly
4309500	4312940	I thought you just wanted you just wanted the sparkling jackets
4314220	4316620	Dude rod Roddy was the man don't make fun of rod ready
4317980	4323300	Anyway, sorry about that. I was actually gonna call the CBS executive. I'm just too fucking tired
4323300	4325300	But
4325460	4330500	I am up in arms over the Sony versus Church of England thing and how Sony is taking
4331380	4332980	whole thing
4332980	4340140	Initially, they weren't taking it seriously at all. They're saying oh, we're talking to the Church of England and Church of England was like, um, no
4342020	4349460	No one's talking I think the Church of England's demands are a little bit harsh they want resistance fall man to be
4349460	4356260	Completely removed from the shelves and for them to completely redesign the level that the Church of Manchester then. Mm-hmm
4356820	4358820	I don't agree with that
4359340	4362940	As much as I would love Sony to burn out
4363940	4365940	I
4367060	4370940	Would it's kind of a it's a it's a height of man
4370940	4379340	I understand it's only the business and they're saying oh like the building whatever
4379940	4388300	Last I checked. I don't think buildings have lightness, right? Yeah, and you know, isn't it kind of common to see famous landmarks in video games
4388300	4392940	I mean how many games are out there that involve the White House, you know that you know
4392940	4397980	Like in that alien shooting game was destroy all humans. You could blow up the White House, you know
4397980	4403500	Or how about all the movies out there that have you know, New York City real story?
4403500	4408180	Well, but usually though in a lot of those you're getting the permits to shoot at those locations
4408180	4411820	But I guess not always because sometimes they shoot in Canada and make it look like the u.s
4412540	4418180	Certain landmarks they do that channel game. It takes place in a fictional future that I
4419540	4425180	Agreed there the church has somewhat of their panties in a bunch, but you know, it wouldn't pain Sony to go
4425180	4428900	Look, sorry, we pissed you off our bad, but we're not going to recall the game bill
4428900	4431220	Sorry that you're offended by this fuck off
4434260	4437380	What would you like to see happen as a resolution insanest
4438700	4442060	I would I would just like to see you know
4442580	4444100	the church of England saying oh
4444100	4449320	You should donate some money to a gun control education fund because those of you who aren't aware
4449320	4455520	Where Manchester England is a horrible horrible gun problem. Um, I want to say a month and a half two months ago
4455520	4462200	A 15 year old kid was killed taken identity. It was a gun crime. The kid got killed execution style. It was
4463000	4465440	Not something you like reading well then that
4465960	4469640	That's very unfortunate and that sounds like a very fair resolution as well
4469640	4474080	You know that Sony donates a little money to charity all as well kiss and make up
4475320	4477320	Yes
4477320	4483840	But that's about it on that. Um, I would like to plug the insaneest hour. It's not STFU
4484400	4488440	It's me making fun of stuff and swearing for an hour and playing music
4488640	4492760	and there you go Ashley and we should say it here on the show this all kind of went down while I
4493080	4498880	Was out of town and while the rest of us were on vacation, but STFU finally did
4499600	4503680	Unfortunately, so we're sad to see it go, but that's all right
4503680	4508960	It was over things with my employer who as I've been adamant will remain nameless. Yep
4509080	4513320	So they're so I'm sorry. I'm sorry to see the STFU finally had to but hey, it was a good run
4513320	4518080	You know, you still had some bigger names on STFU than we have in the five years of Orange Lounge radio
4518720	4523680	And we're not we're not having anybody on like people think we're gonna have like these big surprise guests on next week
4523680	4527880	There are no guests next week. Actually, there's nobody come out next week. I
4527880	4533880	Was actually gonna come next week. I had things come down where the checkbook said no
4533880	4537200	I know it's it's you know money happens. No, it's okay
4537200	4540680	I think we're at a point now where we're actually gonna have no guests and that's kind of how we're gonna do it
4540680	4541980	It's just gonna be the three of us next week
4541980	4546160	But I'll tell you more about what's gonna happen next week a little later in the show. So well fine
4546160	4550040	Why don't you just act like you're better than everybody and clamp yourself in your stupid?
4550400	4555800	Orange Lounge room and do your own radio show for your fifth year anniversary and not share it with anybody else
4555800	4562680	Oh, wait, you're radio. Yeah, I'll do that actually and you know how else I can assert that I'm better than you insaneist

4600740	4604420	Alright, well then I guess that's it since no more calls are coming in. We'll go ahead and close up the skype line
4604420	4608180	We had a lot of calls tonight. Anyway, I just thought I saw some other numbers popping up, but they must have stopped trying
4608380	4610660	So that's about it. We're gonna wrap things up
4610660	4617820	Let's go around and first ask if there's any last-minute stories anything last-minute that wants to be brought up tonight
4618540	4620540	Loki usually have something. Yes, I do
4623660	4628640	Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out Diablo is getting the movie
4631100	4633100	Apparently
4633140	4638260	Legendary pictures their website is listing Diablo movie as in development as
4638260	4642580	As well as a clash of the Titans remake. Oh lord
4642860	4647040	And they will they have the really bad dubbing like the world warcraft film. So, uh
4648780	4650780	Excellent
4651540	4655140	Let's see what else then again legendary pictures did the new Batman didn't they?
4655940	4660980	Yeah, it's like a pretty fucking rad movie. So I you know, this may not be the end of the world
4661020	4666140	Well with the halo 3 beta ending something else had to take its place, right?
4666140	4672020	well going outside halo 3's viral marketing campaign has taken its place and
4674260	4677620	Hello or move over I love bees and welcome
4678300	4684540	Adjundant reflex and it's apparently this weird viral marketing campaign that they have going on clean people
4684540	4686540	you know staying in the street with signs and
4687260	4691780	Websites with calendars and whatnot. So if you want more info on that
4691780	4698780	See, why are they standing in the street with signs the people that are waiting for halo 3 are playing Gears of War while they're waiting
4698780	4703860	Well, they're not outside. This is part of the viral marketing campaign. So yeah
4704260	4706820	Ace combat 6 is getting a limited edition
4707580	4713180	Flightsick bundle that's gonna be coming out their team Bandai and Hori are teaming up to release
4713180	4720820	It's gonna have this really elaborate flight stick, which I'm unaware of works for any other game other than Ace combat 6. So
4720820	4725420	I might be looking at a what was it? Another mecha not mecha saw them
4726460	4728260	Jamie help me here
4728260	4730260	stupid game with a very large
4730500	4732100	control stick

4734820	4737100	So but yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you
4737700	4740660	And then this rumor just won't die
4741420	4743640	apparently Matt Casamani from
4743640	4750080	IGN posted a while back about halo on the DS. Well, apparently in their latest podcast
4750080	4757640	They said it's a real game. We're gonna lay down some ownage next week or soon afterwards showing you guys that it's a real game. So
4758600	4761560	IGN will probably have info about halo DS
4762400	4764400	Soon what the hell?
4765720	4767720	And I thoughts exactly
4768320	4770960	Yeah, that's all I have is cares. I
4770960	4772760	I
4772760	4777320	Mean like they're they're like, I don't know to me the way you read that and I don't know if that's the way you poster
4777320	4779920	If you bell short, but it sounds like they're like kind of just like they're like
4780240	4786640	We've got a big cock cuz we knew that halo was really on the DS and we're gonna prove it
4786640	4789640	I mean who cares if the game never came out. I
4790320	4794280	Mean why I'm supposed to look at like oh look how this game was almost like completely bad
4794280	4801040	Well, in other news, there's a video of Diablo for the Game Boy online. So I heard about that, you know, whatever all
4801280	4802840	right
4802840	4804840	Dar sucker you have anything last minute?
4807240	4810520	I'm sorry, is this show not living up to your expectations tonight?
4810520	4814080	I had a headache most of the show is this just oh, I'm sorry to hear that
4814440	4820940	Because your body screamed in my ear both of you take two of these on neupron little you know different
4820940	4824740	I needed the Wayne's World reference version
4825420	4829840	Because the other one was little yellow different better was the real commercial anyhow
4830580	4835620	And what happened to new print now? I think I was reading up on it on Wikipedia once
4835620	4838260	I think they got bought by somebody else, but I don't care anymore. I don't care enough
4838580	4841820	Anyhow, let's talk about next week since we're at the end of the show
4841820	4845940	I'm next week is our fifth anniversary show and for the fifth anniversary show
4845940	4850340	It's just going to be Loki dark soccer and myself. We're not gonna have any special guests this week
4850340	4855020	We're gonna kind of celebrate our fifth year anniversary by doing nothing because it's what we do best
4855740	4856900	beer
4856900	4859240	There might be a little bit of liquid celebration
4859240	4861880	But no actually the other thing we're gonna do is that you know
4861880	4866540	We were actually bouncing some ideas around we were gonna use some of our ties to try and get some big names on the show
4866540	4871240	But we figure now why not? Well, we'll save that for later on down the line and through the summer and stuff. So
4872100	4876780	what we're gonna do next week is that for part a we're gonna do our normal gaming show and do the
4876780	4878780	The
4878940	4882800	Usual gaming news and everything that we usually do but part B
4882940	4888880	What we're gonna do next week is we're gonna open up the skype line for all of part B because orange lounge radio
4889180	4895320	You know when we started we were all about interaction remember kind of like the way we always talked about our show
4895320	4898880	Is that if we'll remember like when we used to go play DDR?
4898880	4903780	We would go to Brookfield's after and sit around and talk shit and talk about games and such games cool that
4904060	4906060	Orange lounge radio is but on the radio
4906060	4910700	So for part B, we're gonna get out the dinner table. Like we're at Denny's or whatever diner
4911220	4917140	We'll just order some pizza pizza and we're gonna open up the skype line and we're gonna have you guys call in and just talk
4917140	4922700	Shit with us for a few hours about games and everything. And if you guys want to pass on your congratulations, that's cool, too
4922700	4926980	Whatever you want to do for, you know, it's gonna be your man. I remember the first show though
4926980	4929540	I know some good times. I was in this chair
4929540	4937360	Uh-huh passed out with a migraine and the second show man, that was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room
4938140	4942720	And patrese is in chat and says yay. We can hear the same three people for an hour
4942860	4944860	Well, we're hoping that that won't happen
4944860	4950860	We're actually kind of hoping that maybe some folks might drive drop in on the skype line that you wouldn't expect
4950940	4955980	So who knows we're hoping to get some callers. We may not usually get on the program. That's
4955980	4960860	What we're looking at for next week to get this guy from the sky. That'd be funny possibly
4960860	4963180	I mean who knows who's gonna call in next week, so
4963660	4964860	We'll see
4964860	4966500	We're gonna put the call out there
4966500	4970360	But we do want our listeners to get in on it too because even those folks that have
4970660	4974400	Even the same three people that always call in definitely make this show a part of what it is
4974660	4980040	So if you've never listened live before and you want to get in next week is an excellent chance to do that again
4980040	4985860	We tape live at six o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our life 365 station more information can be found at orange lounge
4985860	4993220	Radio calm I do I do know that next week's discussion will be quite interesting after all we are getting close to e3
4993700	4998840	Are you saying that even though you got slapped on the wrist about something a while ago?
4999380	5005260	Possibly next week. You're gonna spill some big-ass beans. I don't know. Maybe maybe thinking about it
5005860	5010340	It's cross my mind across your mind. Stay tuned. That could be fun. All right
5011220	5012900	anyhow
5012900	5018140	We're gonna wrap it up for this week. Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and listening to orange lounge radio
5018140	5020140	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts
5020740	5024580	Explicit sorry, we didn't have like a fourth mic or something to get in on the action more often
5024580	5027220	well, we appreciate you being here as always it's all good and
5028180	5030180	Again, keep it up with the Wii cosplay and whatever
5030980	5032980	Creative cosplays you come up with
5033300	5040300	It'll show up an anime Expo and sack anime as well. Awesome. When is sack anime? It's July 13th through 15th
5040300	5046460	We want to make an appearance somehow. So I'm gonna be there. Yeah, I want to be staff there now
5046460	5049680	Can we do a panel or something? Yeah, get us panel. I'll see what I can do
5049680	5053380	I'll tell you to um, I'll talk to the management and tell me no internet celebrities
5053860	5059700	I'll put it up about I think don't lie. They trust me, but they trust me a lot now. So, all right, sounds good
5062300	5064520	Exactly you want to ruin your rep real fast
5065140	5069420	I'm a good rep. I'm a good rep with this is really really disgusting. All right, I know
5069420	5070540	uh
5070540	5075700	Loki your final thought it smells bad. Stay tuned for the afterbirth
5077020	5081140	That's my final thought if you're listening live. Otherwise, you're seeing live dark soccer
5081140	5087140	I feel really stupid because I deleted almost everything out of my FTP including in the banner for my live journals
5087140	5088860	I have to go home and re-upload it
5088860	5092120	It's like the via was dying. So in three days I get in my
5093380	5099300	Computer that was given to me by vandalism is going to be up and running and I need to think of a clever name for
5099300	5100300	it
5100300	5102700	um, my final thought is
5104260	5109700	Now I want ice cream I didn't want ice cream a couple hours ago, but now I have chocolate mint pudding at home
5110220	5112220	Mmm, sounds good
