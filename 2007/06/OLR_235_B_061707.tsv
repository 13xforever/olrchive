5888	14730	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15451	19132	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20132	24693	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, the 17th of June, 2007.
25793	29194	Happy Father's Day again to those of you folks that are gamer daddies.
29653	31013	We're gonna get back into the gaming news.
31073	33134	Remember, Orange Launch Radio is released in two parts.
33234	35374	And if you haven't listened to Part A, you missed a lot tonight.
35435	41696	So please, go back to wherever you got this show and make sure you've tuned in to Part A. Let's continue on with tonight's program.
41716	44237	And I'm gonna start us off with some more gaming news in this segment.
44637	48578	We talked a lot about PlayStation 3 and a little bit about computer games.
48958	50899	Started to dip into Xbox a little bit in the last segment.
50919	52519	We didn't really mention the Wii a whole lot.
52899	53039	Madden 2008
72165	72846	Thanks for watching!
90758	91939	Madden 08 is not going to use that.
92179	96422	Quote, Madden Wii doesn't support the Wii's friend system during online play.
96762	98904	This is something we're still working on with Nintendo.
99204	105568	For now, our online play uses your EA Nation persona to search and manage your EA Messenger account.
106109	108310	So now you're going to have to balance this whole other thing.
108350	108710	But what?
109231	112433	What if this is something that they're going to support through all their EA games?
112533	115335	Which is fine, then, if they're going to do that.
115788	118634	as long as it's not... I mean, you can call their friend code wherever you want.
118654	121259	If you gotta enter one in for each game, who gives a shit?
121359	121600	I mean...
122728	125951	I just kind of wish Nintendo would just wake up.
126271	128973	Because they're saying we're having problems with Nintendo.
129033	131155	Why is Nintendo holding back on this stuff?
131235	133157	That's obviously what's going on here.
133197	134698	Nintendo's done this with the DS.
135058	138121	They held back on so much of what the DS actually had in it.
138441	141824	They didn't launch DS online until like a year and a half after the system was out.
142264	147448	And then there was also the whole microphone and the voice chatting is just now happening.
147808	151832	I don't know if Nintendo likes to time release the features of their system to...
152532	155373	Make it last longer or what the deal is, but it's weird.
155893	156193	What's that?
156433	156773	Explicit?
157234	158494	I thought it was more technical issues.
159754	162855	I don't know, but it just seems to me like, you know, you're not seeing any online games.
162875	164336	I don't think it's because no one wants to do it.
164376	168737	I think it's because Nintendo's kind of keeping some secrets down or something like that.
170157	176479	Bandit in chatroom says, Online play doesn't start until Nintendo says so, and the next gen doesn't start until Sony says so.
178240	181481	SSJ100 Matt being very random in our chatroom, chat.orangellonsradio.com
181854	183975	Dear Nintendo, bring back the Game Boy printer.
186236	190839	Well, knowing Nintendo, maybe there'll be something to attach it to later, to, like, print out your me or something like that.
192400	193800	RossDLUT brings up a good point.
194180	198523	EA could easily just say, no Madden for the Wii unless you stop with the friend codes.
200124	200804	I don't know, though.
200844	209829	I mean, that's, you know, still... Wii's selling pretty good to an audience that, you know, may not necessarily have a 360, so I think you still want to get Madden out to that audience somehow.
210169	210489	I don't know.
212234	220759	Well, Madden Wii is going to get some other funny features in there as well, including some minigames, Mii integration, and the ability to draw on the screen.
220879	227904	Yes, you too can be just like John Madden and draw on the screen with the brand new Wii Telestrator.
228104	229044	So that's kind of funny.
230836	236197	and, of course, like FIFA and some of the other games that are coming out, you will be able to integrate your Mii in there.
236397	243619	They're going to have a whole set of Mii games, kind of similar, I'm guessing, to Madden 07, you know, just field training and whatnot.
244539	256361	Okay, so you can sketch all over the board like it was, you know, real football and everything, but the $64,000 question is, will you be able to write out boobs on the prompt, on the little thing?
256381	256881	I think you can.
257341	258682	How very un-Nintendo-like.
259442	260042	Amen.
261212	261892	What's that on there?
263173	266934	Then again, Nintendo's supposed to be releasing a child porn game for the DS.
268314	268614	What?
268674	269354	No, no, no.
269434	270435	That is Namco.
271255	272255	Or SNK, I'm sorry.
272555	272915	SNK.
273295	280737	The only new game that they're putting out was that stupid, you know, touch the, you know, witches thing to see if they're witches and you flick their boobs and shit.
281698	283058	What in the fuck are you talking about?
283078	285679	Maybe you should read some more Kotaku, okay?
285899	286599	Or something.
286659	288759	There's at least one story a day about this damn game.
288840	289580	Give me a break.
289600	290340	Give me a break.
291690	294311	There's like 50,000 game blogs out there I'm trying to juggle.
315583	318865	But there's a lot of touching of, you know, women, and you flick their boobs and stuff.
318885	321788	I'm poking Jamie to see if she's a witch right now, actually.
324410	325791	She's about ready to break her bottle.
327672	328392	I beard you.
328693	329333	I beard you.
330294	330594	Wow.
331855	333997	Jamie does not like to be poked and declared a witch.
334497	335858	And Matt in 08 will be online.
335878	336418	I found a witch.
336478	337159	May we burn her?
337199	337559	Of course.
338060	338680	Burn the witch.
338740	341262	You know, they're going to have a two-on-two, um...
342062	346863	versus Mode as well for the minigames, so that's kind of cool.
347003	349624	Madden 2008 featuring hot two-on-two action.
351264	355905	So I have some happy news, like none of us didn't see this coming.
356406	361367	The Wii and the DS are outselling their Sony counterparts with a vengeance.
362467	363647	There have been 338,000 units sold in May.
367287	368048	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
393647	398652	and, dear God, why anyone would want the Spider-Man 3 game, because it wasn't all that good, and Pokemon Pearl.
400054	402756	And Wii Play was on number five, so isn't that cool?
403237	404819	Not really, because the game kind of blows.
405299	405880	So guess what?
406320	406520	What?
406861	408442	The same thing is happening in Japan.
409043	409223	Oh, really?
409243	410584	Like any of us are surprised.
411245	416871	So, dear Sony, bite our asses, not love me.
417921	420083	Someone's a little bitter over Sony right now.
420423	420964	What's up with this?
421004	422786	Why all of a sudden Sony angst?
423346	426930	You weren't swayed by anything you heard about the agency in Part A?
428031	428291	Okay.
429192	429692	Parappa?
430493	430673	No?
431234	431835	Silent Hill 5?
431875	432495	Parappa!
432956	435278	Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction is going to be awesome.
436440	437541	Project Hammer has been cancelled.
437561	440663	IGN has moved on to look at some more expanded audience projects.
466277	467678	Whatever that is supposed to mean.
469539	472100	Hopefully it's something original no matter what it is.
472260	472781	But there it is.
472841	475142	Nintendo, by the way, has not released an official statement.
475742	482506	But some folks have kind of seen this coming for a little while because Project Hammer went into this mysterious TBA status on its website.
483046	485188	And it has yet to move from that status.
486088	486829	So there you go.
487449	493272	It was supposed to be a very interesting plot where you had a hammer-wielding cyborg and you're protecting the U.S.
493332	494433	from killer robots.
495340	497061	MC Hammer do the voice for Project Hammer.
518558	519919	That would have been so appropriate.
520759	522180	Well, you can't touch this game now.
522220	523481	It's been cancelled, actually.
523721	524782	Hammer, don't let them hurt you.
526183	529245	Did either of you guys see this at E3 last year when we were all there?
529265	530506	Yeah, I remember Project Hammer.
530746	533548	I think they still had it on the website, on Nintendo's website.
533568	534348	Well, this is a rumor.
534368	537891	It's not officially cancelled, but all signs point to... I don't know.
538251	545135	I know, just working in the retail and distribution side, there's a lot of things that go cancelled for a while and then come back.
545216	545776	It's just because...
546257	546998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
569333	573195	Thank you, Loki, for bringing down the maturity level of this show to a whole new low.
573455	573715	Appreciate it.
573735	574755	No problem.
574775	578357	Just real quick, some chat comments from chat room.
578437	583939	Ranma says, Interesting.
585120	586200	Yeah, it didn't look that bad.
586260	590502	I mean, you know, considering that the Wii just simply isn't as powerful as the other systems.
592043	592483	Well, there you go.
592863	593143	All right.
594175	601578	So, another interesting game coming out to the DS is going to be Taika No Touch in DS.
602158	610601	And Taika No Touch in DS is going to have these two little kind of cute stylus drum things, I guess, for it.
610901	613202	So you're going to be able to beat the screen like a taiko drum.
614335	616716	Aren't the styluses kind of already drumsticks?
616916	622259	Yeah, but it's two of them now, so you have two of them that you can drum the screen with.
622399	624840	But your DS actually comes with two styluses.
624880	628622	They give you a spare in there, and yet you still lose these little bastards everywhere.
628742	634025	Maybe if my wife lost the stylus.
634845	636186	Whatever, who cares?
636326	637787	You get two free styluses with it.
638047	638467	That's awesome.
638487	639788	So you can play this game once.
640643	641023	You just figured.
671974	672935	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
694557	703043	Well, you know, there is something that a bunch of us have played several times, I'm sure, if we had any real video game taste, which those of us in this room do.
704044	715713	So, wonderfully, it is now Europe's virtual console's 100th game, F-Zero X, which is like freaking rad.
715793	719616	I remember playing a ton of F-Zero X. You know what's funny?
720116	722178	F-Zero X is the one F-Zero game I didn't play.
723399	728163	I know, I played the one on the Super Nintendo, definitely the GameCube one, which was so underrated.
728283	729865	F-Zero X was like hotness.
730045	731146	Well, maybe they'll release it here.
731506	732647	Maybe that's a good sign that it's coming here.
732667	734309	Or you can come to my house and play it on my Nintendo 64.
734789	736951	You're actually going to hook that shit up just so we can play F-Zero X?
737051	737892	If I can find it, I will.
738032	738733	All right, it's a date.
739053	740414	I'll hook it up on my Nintendo 64.
740494	742316	Oh, that's right, I threw mine away in a dumpster.
745079	747160	I still have my Nintendo 64 in a box somewhere.
747200	748342	I can't find my Dreamcast, though.
748382	748662	I have...
749341	761274	all the accessories for the Dreamcast I think I'm missing a box I also have a Dreamcast sitting in a box over there that's not being used I want to use it as a Nintendo emulator and play some Guardian Legend again
762571	763331	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
787210	791536	Put them on this cartridge and play pirated old school Nintendo games to your heart's content.
791917	794260	And it will only cost you $135 if you get one of these things.
797941	798742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
820663	825407	Well, I mean, compact flash readers are not exactly cheap pieces of equipment and the whole thing.
825507	832092	We were joking, myself and my wife were joking, because we saw another one of those iPhone commercials that they have on TV.
832112	836275	They're all, this isn't just, you know, the internet for phone.
836296	838337	This isn't, you know, scaled down internet.
838357	839118	This is the real internet.
839138	840839	I'm like, it better be the fucking real internet for $600.
841179	845783	And then she's like, you should say that about every feature on it.
845803	847424	I'm like, yeah, it better fucking be for $600.
848826	850627	There's lots of people waiting for their iPhones.
850967	851427	I know this.
851467	852007	Well, shit.
852287	856109	It better be everything that they promise it will be because it's $600.
861331	867494	Apparently the AMA is debating on whether to recognize game addiction as a real addiction.
870268	881718	So yeah, they're going to be debating about it and looking at all the facts and sooner or later we will have something for someone to talk about saying, hey, game addiction's real, see?
883579	884900	It's just like alcoholism.
884980	885801	It's a disease.
886802	890365	How exactly does one go about debating game addiction?
890945	891726	Fucking fine, though.
893227	893587	I don't know.
895008	899052	Exploring the possible dangers of excessive video game playing that's over two hours a day.
899813	903035	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
929232	932094	DarkSakura, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
953207	954528	Where are you going with this exactly?
954868	956248	These people don't have addiction to gaming.
956268	961689	They're obsessive-compulsive, and gaming just happens to be the object of their disorder.
962710	963470	Loki, rebuttal.
964290	967971	Okay, well, still though, that's technically game addiction.
968011	969011	They're addicted to games.
969351	975053	I mean, with OCD or whatever, they're not drinking tons of alcohol.
975133	978434	They're not gambling or anything like that.
978494	979974	Gambling is also obsessive-compulsive.
981403	991608	True, these are all... Okay, well, I can have lung cancer or I can have cancer, but it doesn't mean it's necessarily lung cancer or not necessarily from smoking or something.
991628	992868	Are you saying games give you cancer?
993589	998971	Addiction, I think, requires ingestion of a particular substance that your body eventually becomes dependent upon.
999831	1003233	Having a physical thing that you are...
1003974	1009197	Obsessively Compulsed to Participate in is not the same as a physical addiction.
1009277	1029807	It's just that by doing this task over and over again, your brain chemicals are saying, hey, I like this and I want to keep doing this, as opposed to you actually having a physical addiction to a substance that your body is starting to need to maintain a particular level of normalcy, I guess.
1029827	1032849	So you're basically saying World of Warcraft is not an injectable substance.
1033389	1033569	Right.
1034212	1034612	Rebuttal.
1035733	1041538	How many weekends have you skipped going out with friends and stuff to play World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI?
1041558	1044580	You're pointing at me and like maybe one.
1044640	1046322	Because he knows that I haven't done it.
1046402	1047843	When I was sad and fat.
1048487	1049368	If you're going to point at me.
1049688	1052409	You're not sad anymore.
1053430	1054911	You just lost the debate, bitch.
1054931	1056111	You insulted the ref.
1056451	1058753	Loki is the winner, ladies and gentlemen.
1059673	1061274	I leave it to the chatroom to vote.
1062194	1063375	Chatroom vote.
1063395	1065616	Remember, our opinions don't matter.
1065656	1066977	It's the chatroom's vote.
1068438	1070239	Loki, anything else you wish to add in all seriousness?
1070339	1078063	No, seriously, gaming addiction as something that needs to be treated or something...
1078953	1079533	That's retarded.
1080094	1083595	Fucking parents need to step in and just fucking say, Stop playing your damn games!
1083855	1087297	Or if you're older, just have your girlfriend say, Stop playing your damn games!
1087537	1088377	Which is what you have.
1088557	1090138	I'm putting my drugs for OCD.
1091779	1096421	That's how Loki curbed his gaming addiction, is he married a woman that will pull the plug on him.
1096441	1098562	I still play two hours of games a day, if that.
1098862	1099502	More than that.
1099662	1102123	Okay, then what's my excuse?
1102263	1107886	I was a massive gamer, married my husband, and now I don't really play that much anymore, except for pinball.
1111397	1112458	He still plays more than I do.
1112918	1113399	I don't care.
1113439	1115060	He's welcome to as long as he leaves me alone.
1117362	1120025	Well, there's going to be another kiss with Jack Thompson about this.
1120585	1122146	Ah, ah, ah, ah, no.
1122747	1124569	He who shall not be named.
1125856	1127157	Explicit hasn't been here in a year.
1127217	1129038	He doesn't know about some of our banning topics.
1129058	1133601	We do not mention his name in these circles.
1134242	1137884	It's code name Lord Voldemort is actually what we refer to him as on the show.
1137924	1141947	So whenever you hear Lord Voldemort, that's JT.
1144049	1146110	G4 was banned too, but somebody else brought it up earlier.
1146650	1147651	Leave it to Loki to bring that up.
1147691	1148111	So there you go.
1151054	1153195	GS191 sums it up.
1153255	1154275	Well, there's your cure.
1154435	1156056	Marriage cures gaming addiction.
1156116	1157577	Examples, Loki and DarkSakura.
1157597	1158197	No, it doesn't.
1158597	1159337	I still play.
1159497	1160358	I was never addicted.
1160938	1163799	Because there's no such thing as gaming addiction.
1164159	1165299	I'm not addicted to games.
1165419	1166280	It's like this.
1167480	1171402	My wife doesn't like the fact that I talk about games a lot.
1171462	1174843	Because, well, I work in the games industry.
1175023	1176163	I play games.
1176523	1177604	I do this show.
1178337	1188002	So I'm, you know, talking about work, you know, my outside stuff, what I'm doing, and unfortunately that all comes back to games, because it all has something to do with games, usually.
1188682	1189483	I think about movies, though.
1189763	1190403	A lot about movies.
1190823	1191404	And Transformers.
1191824	1202669	But, um... Still, though, it's just... There... I don't think... I think there's, you know, people have addictive behavior, but these people, if games weren't around, they'd be addicted to something else.
1202749	1205391	So... Whatever.
1205431	1206111	Just fucking...
1207256	1208638	Be responsible people.
1208698	1209859	That's what people need to do.
1210841	1211081	Alright.
1211802	1212302	It's all done.
1212363	1213104	The debate's over.
1213284	1215026	Jamie already lost because she made fun of the ref.
1215246	1215507	Alright.
1216227	1219231	Let's... But Rob, I do that all the time.
1219291	1220092	It's because I love you.
1220493	1221194	Yeah, yeah, whatever.
1221832	1222852	DarkSakura, who emailed us this week?
1222872	1223372	Some people.
1252313	1255994	A bunch of people, and I'm not reading all these fucking emails, so I'll just, like, start here.
1257194	1259635	Um, this one comes from Osfer.
1260555	1261535	Hey, it's Osfer again.
1261575	1263136	I swear I wasn't drunk, Osfer.
1263876	1264576	Hey, shush.
1264916	1265196	Okay.
1265797	1270658	Since I lack a high-speed connection, I always have to go to a friend's house and wirelessly download your podcast to my PSP.
1271298	1275039	It's been a few weeks since I last listened to this show, so I downloaded all that I could up to the current podcast.
1275459	1278600	An episode a few weeks ago, I found hilarious that Rob called his mom...
1279178	1281219	We got to find out some things that we never knew about him.
1281519	1283639	Like how he dressed up as Courtney Love in lip syncs.
1283799	1285300	Do we really have to bring that up again?
1285460	1289381	Good lord, you guys should find a video and upload it to the site if you can.
1289661	1291982	We are not retelling the story for your benefit explicitly.
1292002	1292982	Go download the podcast.
1293022	1297784	There's still a... One week there should be a Parents of OLR show where you all call your parents or bring them on the show.
1298344	1301405	I'm sure some more interesting things could be revealed about you guys.
1302085	1302965	Anyway, thanks for reading.
1304406	1307667	You know, if we got my mom out here, that would be great because I want to get my mom to California.
1308952	1336234	and for me it was kind of like a one time joke like you know sequels aren't ever as good as the original it was kind of like a one time joke it happened that was the Mother's Day show by the way where that happened so there you have it no but that was good my mom did great on the show considering she really did have no idea we have considering she had no idea we were calling her live she did a great job so I was very proud of her so the next email dun dun dun if you're ready hey you know it's that person again but this is great
1337071	1341014	And now I give you ten random questions spurred from my void of boredom.
1341094	1343055	This is Ossifer again?
1343175	1343415	Yes.
1343676	1345357	I still am not drunk, Ossifer, I swear.
1345577	1346197	One, freeze.
1346517	1348399	What are you all doing right now at this moment?
1348899	1349640	The fucking show?
1350100	1351161	Yeah, we're doing a radio show.
1351261	1352822	Actually, Loki is not doing a radio show.
1352862	1358986	I can clearly see, plain as day, Loki is playing on some Transformers-related website and not paying attention to the mailbag.
1359286	1360947	Now, now, this is game-related.
1360967	1362928	This is the opening cinematic for Transformers the game.
1363009	1363529	So, huh!
1364818	1365538	And I'm paying attention.
1365718	1366619	I just got served.
1366739	1367019	Two.
1367299	1368219	Okay, you can move now.
1368359	1370320	What is your favorite drink that helps you get up and go?
1372041	1372481	Coffee.
1373761	1374062	Tea.
1376042	1377863	Loki's stacking Pepsi cans over there.
1379143	1379964	Honestly, water.
1380944	1381524	Or coffee.
1381744	1382865	If I need caffeine, coffee.
1383165	1385026	Otherwise, I drink a crap load of water.
1385566	1387106	But tonight, it's Malibu and root beer.
1388327	1390628	Which isn't as bad of a combination as you might think.
1391568	1392088	How many questions?
1392108	1393649	Wait, this is ten random questions you said?
1394304	1396645	Oh boy, it's only a three-hour show.
1396685	1397546	Let's keep it moving.
1397706	1398806	What is the capital of Germany?
1402048	1402768	Wienerschnitzel.
1404209	1404549	Four.
1404649	1407391	What is your favorite song on either Beatmania 2DX or DDR?
1408131	1410372	No, the Germany question is still bugging me.
1410472	1413394	It was the city that was separated for so long.
1413834	1414174	Berlin.
1414194	1414394	Berlin?
1414794	1415575	Yes, it was Berlin.
1415595	1416575	I like Berlin, the band.
1417436	1417976	On the metro.
1419376	1420897	I like Wienerschnitzel, though.
1421438	1422298	That's it for the questions.
1423075	1423495	Oh, that's it?
1423535	1423976	No more questions?
1423996	1424656	I'm not going to read any more.
1425376	1428578	Dear Orange Lounge Radio, there needs to be an Oregon Trail for the DS, dammit.
1429339	1435322	I'd prefer it be based on Oregon Trail 2 engine, but considering the chances of it coming out, I'd be happy anyways.
1435942	1437303	What are other things y'all wish for?
1437343	1439724	Perhaps even more Actraiser for Sky if he insists.
1440765	1443707	Also, though not related to gaming, there should be a Deadpool movie.
1443827	1444207	Yes!
1445127	1447929	Unless they royally screw it up like X-Men 3, then I'd cry forever.
1448749	1449690	That's Tim Surugi.
1451758	1458140	Sorry, I had to look up on Wikipedia what the capital of Germany was because I didn't want to look like a dumb shit any more than I already do on the entire internet.
1458240	1459141	It is Berlin, by the way.
1459181	1463322	If they did a Deadpool movie, they'd have to get the guy that does his voice in the game because he was the Crypt Keeper.
1466283	1468324	Sorry, what was our emailer emailing us about?
1468344	1469264	I was too busy on Wikipedia.
1469284	1471325	What else would I see on DS that was old school gaming?
1472594	1474796	Besides the mandatory Guardian Legend answer.
1475897	1476337	No, you know what?
1476377	1478239	I don't want to see retro games on the DS.
1478319	1482822	I want to see retro games on consoles I can play on my TV just like the old retro games.
1483603	1483943	Zero.
1483983	1486325	There's nothing I want to see on DS that's retro.
1486865	1487406	MDK.
1489447	1490308	That's pretty old school.
1491309	1491989	I think that would be fun.
1492610	1493991	Because I like me some MDK.
1494792	1496073	Did they ever make a sequel to MDK?
1496093	1496673	I thought they had one.
1496713	1497474	Yes, they did, unfortunately.
1498087	1502211	Insanest is yelling in chatroom, Archon, Archon, Archon, over and over again.
1502231	1503312	That was a pretty awesome game.
1503452	1503912	I'll give you that.
1505233	1506374	Or Starcon.
1506795	1507395	I say nothing.
1510077	1510638	Let's see.
1512900	1516183	This one's too long, and I'm just going to end up posting it on the forums anyway.
1516203	1517444	Okay.
1517464	1517724	Okay.
1519796	1524120	I also got an email from one of the people who emailed me in French.
1525821	1527943	It says, thank you for replying to my email.
1528423	1530245	I felt like such a star when you read my letter.
1531866	1532807	I'm not used to all this.
1532867	1535029	By the way, you guys are talking about Sony a whole lot.
1535069	1536190	Thanks for making the effort.
1536610	1538792	And I might have to go and pick up a Pokemon game or two.
1538812	1540193	You guys seem to really love them.
1541465	1545646	I have to be honest, we didn't really change anything in the creation of the show.
1545726	1549707	It's just that I guess the weeks you were listening previous, there just was a lot of Xbox-heavy news.
1550127	1554949	But right now, there seems to be actually more Sony and PC news this week.
1555329	1558950	So it just depends on the flow of news, what we cover.
1559590	1562351	By the way, that was Spamouflage.
1563511	1564011	I love that name.
1564111	1564831	That's a pretty rad name.
1565472	1566692	And then I'm not going to read any more e-mails.
1568554	1569775	Are the emailers being punished?
1570195	1570755	I'll read one.
1570995	1571595	One more, alright.
1571715	1572476	From AZHP.
1572796	1572996	Okay.
1574237	1580139	Hi guys, I was listening to your podcast on the way to class today and I noticed you guys talking about how Mario Party 8 backups don't work on the Wii.
1580859	1588603	As I am a college student and I back up my games so that I don't have to lug around DVD cases back and forth, I'm mentioning this so I don't get you guys in trouble for talking of piracy.
1589483	1593325	In fact, I've also contributed to the design of a Wii mod ship for this purpose.
1593445	1596026	Anyway, I can confirm that Mario Party 8 backups work fine.
1596496	1597757	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1619179	1619659	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1645478	1646879	That brings me to my question for you guys.
1646899	1649220	Do you think it's possible for a company to stop piracy in its tracks?
1649380	1649821	Fuck no.
1651122	1651782	That was me, by the way.
1652642	1658206	Do you think that the funds invested in stopping piracy is greater than the potential loss incurred from allowing it to run rampant?
1658566	1661468	I'm not asking if the monetary value of the pirated goods is significant.
1661888	1662609	Obviously it is.
1663149	1669613	However, most people who pirate wouldn't buy nearly the same amount of games as they are pirating.
1670396	1675780	So do you think it's the company's best interest to stop modding, or do you think it's something that they do in order to appease uneducated shareholders?
1676461	1677282	That's a good question.
1677462	1681225	I think it is not in their interest, but I want to hear your two cents.
1681525	1682326	Sorry for the long email.
1682346	1683226	Hope you guys enjoyed it.
1683306	1683887	AZHB.
1685188	1688851	I think that that's part of it, too.
1688871	1697618	The average boardroom suit and tie person is only going to look at numbers.
1698342	1704725	They're only going to look at face value good idea because, remember, once you get into upper management, you turn into a moron.
1706505	1707566	Wow, someone's jaded.
1708686	1709466	That's all right, I understand.
1710787	1714748	I think that some of it is for, you know, face.
1715869	1721291	Some of it is, I think, they want to discourage the casual pirates.
1722020	1726623	These people said, oh, I can just clip this on the back of my PlayStation and I can play whatever, blah, blah, blah.
1726964	1729405	They want to discourage those people who don't know what the fuck they're doing.
1730206	1734749	For those of us who know what we're doing, there's not going to be any way that they can stop us if we try hard enough.
1735850	1736731	If we care enough.
1737491	1747158	Here's my thing, is that with no disrespect to the emailer, you go to all this trouble to back up games because you don't want to haul DVD cases around.
1748079	1749820	Am I really supposed to believe that?
1753426	1754146	I mean, I guess.
1754206	1754767	I guess it's possible.
1754787	1758908	It just seems to me like that's... It's not that I'm saying like, oh, you're a thief or whatever.
1758928	1762450	I'm just like, that seems like an awful lot of trouble to go to.
1763350	1766791	Just to not have to carry around DVD cases, which aren't that big a deal.
1766891	1778256	Better yet, if you're backing up a game, say, onto another DVD to play it on your system, aren't you still carrying around that DVD?
1778856	1781237	It's just now it's a backed up one instead of the real one.
1781772	1783433	I don't understand how that's cutting down on DVDs.
1783894	1787437	Of course, our chat room is chiming in here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1787497	1794983	Blackwolf, our old buddy who just turned 100 today, said, we tried to stop them, but they always get by what we do.
1795103	1798986	It sounds better than, well, we won't do anything because they'll get around it anyway.
1801067	1803910	I guess that's a good point, kind of going back to the boardroom things going on there.
1804710	1809234	NintendoManiac64 says, backing up DS and GBA games is very helpful, though.
1810413	1810973	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1835472	1836433	Halo 3 Controllers and Headsets
1852364	1854306	and this is going to be coming out from GameStop.
1854346	1855527	At least GameStop is now listing them.
1855567	1856467	Everyone's going to have them.
1856487	1859110	Everyone's going to have them but GameStop has kind of spilled the beans on it.
1860270	1866295	This is $59.99 for the wireless controllers because you're going to pay $10 more because they have pretty pictures on them.
1866756	1873421	One has the Spartan, one has the Covenant and then there is also a green headset that's going to be coming out.
1873441	1874842	I don't see the price for this one.
1874902	1877284	Oh, it's also $59.99, the wireless headset.
1877424	1880727	All it really is, it's green and the button is orange and it has a
1881391	1882212	Halo 3 Master Chief
1908427	1909428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1929744	1932865	I got a Halo Xbox, and I'm not even that big a Halo fan.
1932885	1936567	I just bought it because that's when I finally decided to buy an Xbox.
1936607	1938507	And it probably came with a free game, didn't it?
1938547	1939328	Halo, actually.
1940168	1941529	Hence the Halo Xbox.
1943109	1949011	Anyways, I'm not a big fan of Halo, but I am a big fan of this game.
1949472	1951872	Grand Theft Auto 4.
1952513	1955054	They're getting a new trailer coming out on June 28th.
1955114	1956174	Yes, once again, teasing us.
1956638	1958559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1987020	1989142	Are you really that excited over a trailer?
1990303	1994246	Yes, because it's just like the Transformers movie.
1994346	1996848	I watch every bit of stuff I can on it.
1997289	1999851	Of course, now I'm going to start slowing down because I don't want to spoil anything.
2001012	2002253	Although I've already spoiled too much.
2003334	2004335	Fair enough, I suppose.
2005436	2010960	Well, something that I guess people will care about is that Track and Field...
2012424	2018848	is going to be closer to release on Xbox Live Arcade probably in, quote, the next month or two.
2018868	2024352	Yeah, it's track and field.
2025313	2029035	Not one of the best old school Konami games that exist, but...
2029676	2031157	Well, they've had some pretty good ones lately.
2031217	2032297	Like, I like Time Pilot.
2032358	2033378	Russian Attack was kind of fun.
2033398	2036280	But Track and Field was just like, you just would slam the button.
2036300	2037480	It's make my thumbs hurt the game.
2038141	2042403	Yeah, it's like all those old school Mario Party games where you just hit the button over and over and over again.
2042423	2043444	That's all Track and Field was.
2044244	2045985	One auto-fire controller will fix that.
2046365	2047126	Hell yeah.
2048006	2051768	That's why we had the turbo button on the TurboGrafx.
2051808	2052089	Hi.
2052109	2054410	I needed to find one of those.
2055356	2056337	Easy Achievement Points.
2056738	2057318	Hell yeah.
2057839	2061102	Well, maybe there'll be something to kind of get around the auto-fire or something.
2061142	2064305	You'd think they'd put something into place, but we'll see, I guess.
2064325	2064966	Oh, they won't?
2065026	2065606	Come on!
2065646	2068069	These people are lazy when it comes to making these games.
2068089	2069470	They're just pouring it straight over.
2069871	2071472	Maybe that'll be a title that comes out.
2071492	2074295	Like, you know how some weeks they've been doing two games a week lately?
2074675	2078259	Maybe that'll be kind of the B-side for the week will be track and field.
2079113	2088787	Anyhow, Halo 2 and Shadowrun, of course, both recently came out in the new Games for Windows collection that's Vista only, or is it?
2090208	2096237	Falling Leaf Studios has actually gone to extents to make the games XP compatible.
2096738	2097279	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2117546	2124010	that says, first, Microsoft claimed that it was impossible to implement DirectX 10 compatibility atop Windows XP.
2124370	2129974	And now they also want us to believe that they couldn't successfully launch two DirectX 9-based titles on XP either.
2130354	2134277	We plan to expose both theories as patently false.
2135417	2140060	But now they haven't really, you know, they haven't showed this to be true yet.
2140100	2141801	The software doesn't already exist.
2142162	2145704	Supposedly, this is going to come out within a few months.
2146620	2149202	We shall see if they can expose that to work.
2149262	2152203	It's a huge scam.
2152323	2153044	Is it a scam?
2153084	2155285	You're still getting the game for the regular price.
2155345	2158146	It's just that they got a cut of it from Amazon.
2158367	2158747	I don't know.
2159847	2160308	We'll see.
2161728	2163830	Bandit in chat is very adamant here.
2163870	2165150	He says, it's a fake.
2165450	2167011	He's 19 and is lying.
2167251	2168912	He makes 10% on that shiznit.
2169613	2169913	That's true.
2169933	2171133	There's really nothing they can do about it.
2172094	2173555	Somebody complained to Amazon, maybe.
2173615	2174135	I don't know.
2174755	2175016	Well...
2176348	2181110	Yes, our usual fucking plug for GameTap.
2181150	2182511	But anyways, this is news.
2183651	2187533	Brand new, their free service that they launched, I believe, last month.
2188373	2192715	They're actually now going to be expanding it, which was currently 30 games, to 40 games now.
2192895	2196297	So I guess they've got a few more people backing it.
2197269	2206611	And they've also, I guess, for the regular subscription service, they've added Psychonauts, King of Fighters 97, Golden Axe the Duel, Art of Fighting 3, and Metal Slug 3.
2206651	2208112	Dude, Golden Axe the Duel.
2208372	2210392	I think that's pretty awesome that Psychonauts is on there.
2210412	2213193	Those are some pretty awesome games they put on there for free.
2213573	2214793	Dude, I love Golden Axe.
2216433	2218174	I don't like the first Genesis one.
2218534	2220714	It makes me miss the arcade.
2221194	2223575	The Duel was actually one of the first Saturn games I ever played.
2224645	2226327	I keep forgetting you have a Saturn.
2227268	2230692	When I lived in Alabama, my friend wanted a Saturn so badly he imported it.
2231073	2232915	He was the world's biggest Sega fanboy.
2233015	2233976	So he imported a Saturn.
2234376	2236779	So the first games I got to play was King of Fighters 95.
2237160	2239482	I learned the Ram Cart Switch.
2240624	2243447	And Golden Axe the Duel and some Gundam game that was okay.
2245226	2247127	Actdeft in our chatroom is getting very excited.
2247167	2248907	King of Fighters 97 for free.
2248987	2250788	No, it's for paid accounts.
2251148	2252168	Oh, only the paid accounts?
2252188	2254009	Those are your games for the paid accounts.
2254489	2256690	Although it may cycle through into the free games.
2257470	2257950	You never know.
2258030	2260711	There's 40 games to choose from right now for free.
2261591	2261891	Interesting.
2262031	2265552	That would suck though if you were getting really attached to a title and then they pull the plug on it.
2265773	2267613	But I guess that's how they make their money.
2267633	2269514	They're not in business to just give things away.
2269534	2270114	I guess that's true.
2270154	2270394	Well,
2274938	2284664	One thing that I think our Second Life friends will enjoy, another thing to keep you ingrained in unreality, is that they are adding voice.
2289307	2295771	It's actually, from what I understand, it's at Warhead, one of the places in Second Life.
2296472	2298673	I don't play Second Life, so I have no idea what the hell they're talking about.
2298833	2299273	Me neither.
2300034	2301095	You are greeted by...
2302671	2330051	Dancing and Flying Sperm and Gunfire That sounds like Second Life This is even better than the Flying Cocks That is something that they should turn into a TV show Second Life TV show But apparently now that's not happening anymore because they have voice chat So people, you can download a special version of the client and in certain places, and one of the places is Waterhead you can hang out and just chat with people
2331514	2332434	Dude, you know what I can do?
2332935	2336336	I can pick up my phone and call people and chat with them if I wanted to fucking talk to people.
2337216	2338576	I'm online for a reason.
2339497	2342638	Drew Nami in chat says, it's about fucking time, Second Life.
2342918	2345439	There has had voice for fucking ever.
2346499	2351701	Well, there is like a competing type of thing that has had voice chat for a while.
2351721	2352741	I've heard of there before.
2352761	2354862	Remember DDR Angel when she was coming on this program?
2354902	2355862	She was really into there.
2356542	2357803	Was that game she was really into.
2358323	2358723	So, huh.
2359566	2364630	I did find the Final Fantasy 7 thing that they made in Second Life.
2364670	2368914	It was pretty cool.
2370315	2375739	I've always wanted to check out Second Life, but I always go back to World of Warcraft because I have no First Life.
2375799	2378281	And I was like, oh my god, this sucks, and then deleted it.
2379102	2384927	I'm afraid that with Second Life, it would be like me and The Sims, where no good can come of this.
2385748	2388569	We should start, can't you start a little OLR club or something?
2388829	2389469	I don't want to do that.
2389669	2395710	Like, I just want, there used to be like a little all games room, but then somebody stopped paying rent on it or whatever, so it got imploded.
2395730	2401652	Because I remember somebody sent us a picture of our little OLR logo somewhere in Second Life, and I was like, oh, that's kind of neat.
2403112	2403552	There you have it.
2405273	2406153	So much for Second Life.
2407856	2411139	While I was bored during my first life, I was surfing on Dig.
2411659	2413982	And this story was dug, which I thought was interesting.
2414022	2416484	It's from the website TooOldToPlay.com.
2416824	2421428	And the topic is about, it says, childhood gaming, what games would you like remade?
2422009	2428775	And it just basically goes on to say, hey, you know, we remember these games from when we were older, from the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Genesis, and 3DO.
2429936	2431597	Apparently this author remembers the 3DO.
2431737	2432598	I do not remember the 3DO.
2434363	2437365	Shadowgate 2, WWF Wrestling Arcade Game 3, River City Ransom 4, Maniac Mansion 5, Akari Warriors 15
2459089	2462470	Just talking about how we would like to see these kind of redesigned.
2462490	2465270	Maniac Mansion has a sequel.
2465870	2469951	I thought it did, but all these series kind of died a long time ago.
2471751	2472111	I guess.
2472552	2476792	And he says he remembers Zelda, but he can't really say Zelda because Zelda's not really dead.
2476852	2478533	He's talking about these series are all kind of dead.
2481113	2483534	Ross Steel UT in chat says Crystallis.
2484014	2484754	That's a good pick.
2485514	2486154	That was a good game.
2486345	2488587	I also like from this list 11 RC Pro-Am.
2488888	2491310	You know I can't get through this segment without saying Guardian Legend.
2491911	2492432	It's a must.
2494214	2495295	What other old school game?
2495335	2496416	How about StarTropics?
2496456	2497978	What the hell ever happened to StarTropics?
2498038	2500240	I'm surprised it hasn't made it to Virtual Console yet.
2500360	2504465	I'm surprised too, and I'm surprised that the... What was the kid's name in StarTropics?
2505726	2508249	There is a perfect character for Smash Bros.,
2509198	2509578	at some point.
2510078	2511439	God, why can't I remember the kid's name?
2511559	2516000	The only bad thing, though, about that is going to be the fact that you have to dip that manual in water.
2516280	2518760	I think it was Mikey or Mike or something.
2518900	2520081	Mikey, I think, was Goonies, too.
2520701	2522181	He had a really generic name.
2522221	2525582	And it was Zeb or Zeke or something that was a bad guy.
2525602	2526062	Yeah.
2528483	2528963	There you go.
2529503	2532604	Anyways, so we talked a little bit about MAME earlier.
2533724	2536425	Now, one of the boards for...
2537654	2538615	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2566897	2570800	It was no Street Fighter 2 or... I never really got into Street Fighter 3.
2571040	2573402	Maybe I'm not giving you enough credit, but I didn't care for it.
2573462	2574242	It wasn't Street Fighter Alpha.
2574282	2576784	I had my one moment of glory in Street Fighter 3.
2576824	2577725	Yeah, I had a moment.
2578866	2581027	No, I played it a lot, but I had my moment of glory.
2581628	2584510	Street Fighter 3 and I went out on a date, but we just didn't get along.
2586231	2588512	And it wouldn't put out, so I had to say goodbye.
2590294	2590774	There you have it.
2591837	2597359	But I guess that's cool for all you folks that like to pirate tons and tons of arcade games and play them on MAME.
2597379	2600239	That's great news for you guys, so congratulations.
2602960	2611843	Well, here's an interesting thing that's being advertised for GameStop.com is a Wii Blaster available June 27th.
2612263	2614403	Like pew pew pew lasers, I guess.
2616084	2616164	Um...
2617142	2622344	But it's on one of their flyers that it will be available, like I said, on the 27th.
2623444	2630187	I guess to go out with... What game's coming out on Wii that's going to require a gun, maybe?
2630347	2632068	Well, there's Chicken Shoot.
2632588	2634328	Oh, yay!
2634428	2635389	Chicken Shoot!
2635569	2639370	Hey, I guess you may be able to use it for maybe Resident Evil 4.
2639410	2639710	Yeah.
2642099	2648122	Well, later on, back when we get into the Fall Umbrella Chronicles and Ghost Squad, I don't know.
2648182	2649242	But why do we need this yet?
2649483	2651563	Maybe Duck Hunt on Virtual Console.
2651583	2652364	Duck Hunt!
2653064	2656606	Or better yet, this is just a piece of useless crap that they're trying to push on you.
2656806	2662188	Or how about this, better yet, why don't Nintendo do what Nintendo does best and hold out on the good stuff?
2662589	2667251	So instead of giving us Duck Hunt, why don't you give us Wild Gunman?
2668452	2693515	which if you've ever played Wild Gunman maybe we'll get Blastress there was seriously nothing to Wild Gunman it was who can pull the trigger faster when the thing says go Wild Gunman, they made an entire video game and sold this for a lot of money an entire game out of who can push the button first was the game so you'll probably see that on Virtual Console and then you'll get such brilliant classics like Hogan's Alley
2694998	2698481	And only then will Nintendo finally deliver the duck hunt.
2716207	2719989	Not quite as orange as the other one, but accomplishes the same thing, basically.
2720069	2725991	Puts your Wii nunchuck kind of in the pistol grip area, and then, you know, the remote on top.
2726492	2728733	To be honest, both of these are completely useless.
2729073	2733635	It's not the Wii kind of shotgun thing that you saw at E3.
2734615	2736136	This is something completely different.
2736516	2738117	It does not enhance your gameplay at all.
2739824	2743265	Frisbee in chat reminds us about something related to Wild Gunman.
2743325	2746466	Frisbee says, Wild Gunman was good on WarioWare Game Boy Advance.
2746826	2748587	I totally forgot that it was in that game.
2748667	2751247	But yeah, there was many references to Wild Gunman in there.
2752448	2752888	Interesting.
2753468	2753728	I don't know.
2753748	2755629	Is this a peripheral you're interested in getting, Jamie?
2755649	2757249	I know you like to collect everything related to games.
2758270	2758970	That's what I thought.
2759010	2759330	Me too.
2760703	2762865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2785600	2786220	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2814144	2816145	Yeah, because people are dumb and will buy it.
2816186	2816786	Yeah, exactly.
2816806	2820168	I was like, dude, remember the consumer market?
2821489	2821910	Stupid.
2822470	2824171	Make stuff stupid people will want.
2824512	2833358	Maybe having one of these plastic things shaped like a tennis racket will help you win the first organized Wii tennis tournament that any of us know of.
2833738	2835179	It's called Wimbledon.
2835840	2836120	Get it?
2836200	2836780	Instead of Wimbledon.
2836821	2837201	Ha!
2837521	2838522	Wimbledon!
2839366	2843391	It's being held June 23rd at Barcade, which is in Brooklyn.
2843451	2844232	I was just there.
2844512	2845533	It's pretty awesome.
2845553	2846834	Barcade's pretty cool.
2847535	2849117	God damn it, I should have gone to Barcade.
2849497	2850398	I knew of that place.
2850879	2852000	I knew it was in Brooklyn.
2852321	2855824	I was fucking in Brooklyn just a week ago, and I didn't even think to go to this place.
2856485	2856746	Oh well.
2857266	2859849	Here's a quote from the official site for Wimbledon.
2860373	2868897	Wimbledon is a Wii Tennis tournament being held on June 23rd, that's next Saturday, from noon until 5pm at Barcade in Brooklyn, specifically Williamsburg.
2869397	2872659	There will be singles and doubles tournaments, prizes, and beer!
2873119	2874900	Maybe even some strawberries and cream.
2875060	2876441	Oh, and cucumber sandwiches.
2877902	2878282	Okay.
2878702	2880723	I guess that's a joke about Wimbledon that I don't get.
2881363	2881683	I don't know.
2882924	2887346	I don't watch tennis on TV or anything, but I like Wii Tennis.
2887406	2888087	It's kind of fun.
2888847	2889027	Yeah.
2889757	2891538	I know it's not real tennis, but there you go.
2891558	2894600	I was just thinking, you know, those plastic attachments for the Wii and stuff.
2895400	2898442	You know people have trouble as it is holding on to the Wiimote.
2898462	2902384	Can you imagine that with a chunk of plastic flying towards your TV?
2902684	2904385	Talk about some serious damage right there.
2906466	2907146	So, wow.
2908047	2908267	Anywho.
2909738	2911979	Uh, so yeah, you want to get scared?
2912219	2913500	Well, here's your chance.
2913880	2918103	Um, WifeSwap is looking for gamers to be on their show.
2918503	2919844	Wait, like the TV show?
2919984	2921285	Yes, like the TV show.
2921485	2924547	Wasn't that the one that had, like, my favorite lady ever?
2924827	2926488	Yes, the god warrior.
2926548	2927629	I fucking love her.
2927729	2928729	She's the best thing ever.
2929870	2937755	So, um, yeah, so apparently you can, or possibly if you're picked, um, you and another family will swap wives and...
2938386	2940588	Can you imagine if Jamie went on this program?
2940668	2941629	I want no money!
2966540	2970602	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2997088	2999249	I think Loki would be a good candidate for this show, too.
3000089	3004271	I don't plan on breeding, so... I thought you were going to have a kid named Error.
3004911	3005151	No.
3006471	3021436	If you are interested and you qualify, you have a child that's six years or older, if you're interested, you want to email jodyfriedman at rdfusa.com You know, just send her a letter to say hello.
3023379	3025740	Why don't you send her an email and say, hi, what's up, babe?
3025781	3031164	Or just go to abc.go.com slash primetime slash wife swap.
3032645	3034506	I hope one of our listeners gets to do this.
3034526	3035707	That would be far too exciting for me.
3035727	3036747	You should borrow a kid.
3037388	3038068	I wish I could.
3038608	3041850	Oh, Ranma says that was actually trading spouses.
3042071	3045413	The Fox version of the show was the God Warrior Lady.
3045573	3047554	The clip that I played was trading spouses.
3047994	3051336	Wife swap is the ABC version of the same fucking show.
3051676	3051877	Yeah.
3052237	3052437	Okay.
3053552	3054773	Super Nanny and Nanny 911.
3055513	3057314	Same fucking show, two different networks.
3057354	3058434	You should rent a child.
3060895	3063816	Yeah, you could borrow a child for like two weeks.
3064636	3066417	I might see if a co-worker has one you can borrow.
3066557	3066977	No.
3068498	3071659	Besides, I'd get some crazy bitches in my house throwing my shit away.
3071679	3075400	I don't need anyone to be doing that shit.
3077040	3082447	Actually, no, that's right, I would be there, so I would be able to monitor where she throws shit away.
3082907	3084149	No more playing games!
3084429	3086492	Fine, I can do that, you stupid whore!
3089210	3092031	You know they're going to get some World of Warcraft addict on the show.
3092051	3095232	Then you get some smart-ass kid that, you know, obviously, it's not your kid or whatever.
3095312	3097273	Yeah, that's my eight-year-old child.
3097493	3103776	They're going to get some fucking World of Warcraft addict who's going to start twitching the minute they're missing a Tuesday night raid.
3104137	3107198	They're going to start going into, like, and they're going to put him in, like, an Amish house.
3107578	3110440	And he's going to go, oh, actually, no, wait, it's wife swap, huh?
3111280	3113541	They're not going to put him, yeah, he's just going to stay there.
3113561	3115402	They should get a wife that's more addicted than him.
3115482	3117283	Yeah, they should get a, well, or whatever, whatever.
3117901	3125383	Nevermind, I guess it's not Husband Swap I'm just going to shut up and let the callers do the doing now Be funny!

3142466	3147087	Woot, it's Nintendo Maniac 64 Hello Nintendo Maniac 64, what's on your mind?
3148306	3153788	Um, uh, oh, right now, I just gotta ask one little random question.
3154328	3161151	Do you know of anyone who actually doesn't use Windows XP or Vista other than, like, Mac and Linux and stuff?
3162691	3164272	Like, who uses something older?
3165032	3169574	People use any... Well, I mean, like, someone like me who's, like, a diehard Windows 2K addict.
3172404	3198677	I know people who use Palm OS I know people who still are on Windows 98 because they just don't feel like upgrading because all they use is the internet I know people who are still on Windows 3.11 My dad uses Windows ME and I have no idea why but he does I have a computer downstairs that still works with 3.11 in fact the PC I'm on right now is 98 Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
3200137	3207601	I had to have my computer replaced because my husband decided he was going to be nice and upgrade my computer from Windows 2000 to XP.
3207621	3208882	That's not upgrading.
3228105	3230646	Like I said, he thought that he was upgrading.
3230986	3233367	And it turned out that it completely fucked over my system.
3234027	3236428	I ended up having to have it anyway because I bought a VAIO.
3236928	3242069	Now my VAIO is starting to die and I'm just so sad about the day that I have to get a new computer with Vista on it.
3243109	3244350	Well, I have to ask another question.
3244670	3245130	Okay.
3245670	3248551	It was in the first part of the show, maybe it was like late second.
3249371	3255173	When you guys started talking about it was something, like there was a bunch of anime coming to something and then Loki started going...
3255658	3257398	raving about how awesome Akira was.
3257498	3259659	Okay, what's the anime for?
3259919	3261199	Is it coming to something?
3261419	3263939	Xbox Live Arcade, their movie series.
3263959	3265580	No, Xbox Live Video Marketplace.
3266260	3267180	Same fucking thing.
3268100	3269260	The Xbox Live thing.
3269380	3271661	Yeah, it's actually already there right now.
3271861	3275621	Okay, and third off, okay, I gotta have a mini rant.
3276101	3278482	Alright, make it quick.
3278722	3280382	I played it at a friend's house.
3281262	3283203	They had the custom controls.
3283703	3285403	It's like hacked
3285919	3290960	You can't map the weapon cycle to X or O. What the crap?
3291100	3296981	And you can't map it so that you can have turning and moving forward and back on the same analog stick.
3297081	3301142	Since I grew up in Goldeneye and stuff, that was the default control scheme and it's drilled in my head.
3301462	3302302	I gotta use that.
3302702	3306103	And they won't even let me change the individual axes.
3306303	3307383	Like, what the heck?
3307463	3312644	Boo in general to games that don't let you change the button configuration to whatever you like, no matter what it is.
3313447	3323990	Well, the thing is, it did let me change the buttons themselves, except that it wouldn't let me put Weapon Cycle onto X or O. That's strange.
3324430	3325690	I haven't played Resistance.
3325930	3327331	You guys have played it more than I have.
3327431	3336473	There's only one button for Weapon Cycle, and it's, I think, because... Well, all the buttons are analog, I guess, but for whatever reason...
3337526	3344710	I don't know, it's the R2 button, it's the one you do for weapons, so you either tap it, then it'll switch to the next one, or you hold it down and it'll allow you to switch which one you want.
3345110	3350312	I don't know, I love the, it seemed pretty straightforward to me, I just kept it on the default stuff, so.
3350612	3357596	I like it on the X or the O, kind of like where it'd be like on the A button, like the GameCube or the N64, like Goldeneye for example.
3362271	3379286	I suppose it's similar to like when I go, well, a couple years ago when I would go back and forth between Phantasy Star and Final Fantasy XI, they had the camera on completely different axes so that like when I went up and down and stuff, it would like totally mess with my head because it was all messed up.
3380126	3385591	Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac 64, thanks so much for the call and I hope you can get used to the controls in the game.
3386195	3386675	The way they are.
3387056	3387356	Yeah.
3387556	3390217	Well, I don't have a PS3, so that's perfectly fine.
3390237	3392118	It's more incentive for me not to get one.
3392258	3392639	You got it.
3392679	3393399	So never mind, then.
3393479	3393839	Have fun.
3394720	3395360	True, Sony.
3395400	3395620	Bye.
3395800	3396041	Bye.
3397281	3397581	All right.
3398142	3405926	If you would like to give us a call, it's Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3406006	3406767	More phone calls.
3407187	3408247	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3408267	3408628	Who's this?
3409648	3410389	Raven Stolfen.
3410509	3411869	Well, hello, Raven Stolfen.
3411889	3412750	What's on your mind, my friend?
3413649	3414790	Why do you sound analog?
3414830	3416751	I hate Skype 2.5.
3416811	3419072	You sound like you're on, like, an old-fashioned phone.
3419352	3419932	I'm sorry.
3420232	3422273	You kind of sound a little weird, too, but whatever.
3422313	3423034	We'll just have to deal.
3423054	3423534	What's on your mind?
3424154	3425435	It's the 2.5 thing.
3425455	3426035	I'm sorry.
3426555	3426995	It's all right.
3427136	3428656	At least you're not breaking up or whatever.
3428696	3429136	What's on your mind?
3429977	3431498	Yeah, it's much clearer, but that sucks.
3431558	3433218	Oh, sorry for going on that little rant.
3433779	3434899	Mortal Kombat for Wii.
3435660	3437941	I was so tempted to buy this the other day, but I didn't.
3438021	3438481	What about it?
3439628	3443731	I played it, and I got to tell you something, it's a good Mortal Kombat game.
3444172	3448375	I was actually surprised that they did the Wii mode thing very well.
3449036	3450337	Is it easy to control?
3450437	3451998	Because that's the thing that holds me back.
3452118	3452579	Oh, yeah.
3453259	3454260	Oh, hell yeah.
3454340	3454580	Really?
3454620	3455721	It's super easy.
3456742	3458103	It doesn't look... You want to hear how easy?
3458223	3460105	Yeah.
3460165	3468592	You press down the B button, and you move it like a half moon, up and down, left and right, and you do the scorpion get over here real easy.
3469994	3472136	and Fatalities are just super easy.
3472376	3474539	You know what I do with Fatalities?
3474719	3476941	You just hold the button and swing it all around, see what happens?
3478122	3478843	Something like that.
3478923	3485750	You swing it, it's kind of like you swing it and then you press the little directional pad and it will do a Fatality.
3486090	3486991	That's how easy it is.
3488973	3489814	That sounds pretty fun.
3489894	3491176	How do you move the guy around the screen?
3491196	3492537	You just use the control pad on the Wiimote?
3493294	3494834	Can I just rant about the new Skype one?
3494854	3495655	The new Skype?
3495675	3499235	Yeah, 2.5, it has this really annoying ring thing, and it gets in your ear, and it's like, is this a new ring?
3499255	3499755	This sucks.
3521411	3523095	Yeah, that's just my voice that you're hearing.
3523115	3524237	That has nothing to do with Skype.
3525039	3526121	Back to games.
3526342	3526963	Back to games.
3527084	3527585	One more thing.
3528632	3530093	Yes, one more thing.
3530213	3531234	You got a black DS.
3531754	3533035	I sure did, a black DS Lite.
3533395	3540379	I was so close to getting the pink one, but then I decided that next time I go to New York, hopefully the engraving machine will be working and I can get it engraved.
3540679	3544361	And engravings show up much better on the black DS than it does on any of the other colors.
3544702	3546363	So in the end, I went for the black DS.
3546803	3552566	What I do want to get, though, is I'm going to get the little pink case with the sparkling little bling on it.
3552606	3556689	That's what I'm going to get to have my Princess Peach homage.
3557642	3558643	I'm so happy for you.
3559023	3560544	I got a black one, too, and I love it.
3561824	3564546	Yes, and I actually hear the black ones are usually bigger.
3566387	3566827	So I hear.
3567087	3568428	Yeah, all right, but that's just a rumor.
3569008	3572550	All right, anything else you want to add, Raven Stolven?
3573210	3573831	Don't download 2.5.
3574151	3575151	It sucks.
3575351	3576012	All right, I won't.
3576172	3577612	I'll hold that on the current Skype I have.
3578073	3578933	See you later, Raven Stolven.
3578973	3579233	Bye.
3580274	3583836	If you'd like to give us a call, the username is orangeentredo on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3588339	3589580	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3589620	3590040	Who's this?
3591921	3592641	You know who it is.
3592781	3593801	Static Man!
3593881	3595082	Jesus Christ.
3595582	3601104	It sounds like... Do you, like, put this on auto-dial or something, and then when we finally pick up, you, like, jump for the microphone?
3601144	3602065	Like, oh, shit.
3603205	3604806	I just use brute force.
3604926	3606747	I just, like, you know, hammer the line.
3607307	3607967	I'm guilty of that.
3608207	3608948	That's all right.
3609388	3611009	It was good to see you this weekend, Zaku, by the way.
3611029	3611629	Thanks for coming out.
3612887	3616250	You missed our trip to Astor Place in the video game store.
3616270	3617270	That's what we did after you left.
3617290	3617411	I know.
3617451	3618631	I had to play the store.
3618651	3622594	It just came out that weekend.
3622814	3623515	It's all good, buddy.
3623535	3625276	What's on your mind?
3625356	3626036	Let me see.
3626076	3634923	You already know that Rockstar is basically shifting more to the Microsoft side now that they've confirmed exclusive stuff for Grand Theft Auto 4.
3635663	3639846	Basically dispelling any chances of it showing up on the PS3 at all.
3641723	3659100	Yeah, I've heard... And they had the gall to say that the PS3 version would move consoles, which is just a load of bullshit, because if there's nothing beyond the regular game that the PS3 folks can attain, then what's the point of actually playing it?
3659941	3661923	Well, actually, this is Grand Theft Auto 4.
3661963	3662083	Yeah.
3663962	3666423	Rockstar confirmed it in their shareholders meeting.
3666683	3670605	It will move consoles because, oh wait, they don't have the episodic content either.
3670825	3671686	Yes, there we go.
3672066	3672926	That's exactly it.
3672966	3675868	Microsoft paid a good $50 million to keep it on their side.
3675888	3679370	I think it will just move consoles both for 360 and PS3.
3680310	3685012	How could you move consoles when one side doesn't have anything beyond the gameplay?
3686133	3688014	That's what I'm trying to get across to you.
3688584	3690025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3713175	3715996	That'll actually rumble the console when the game's played, you know?
3716396	3720336	Well, that has yet to be seen, but the bottom line is this.
3720796	3725037	Rockstar is basically leaning towards the side of, you know, it's basically the carrot and the stick.
3725637	3729818	The carrot, you know, the stick being Microsoft, the carrot being the money.
3730518	3735979	So they're looking at the numbers right now, and they're trying to get to, you know... What's this about a stick and a carrot?
3736439	3740940	It seems the 360 is something that, you know, they'll make a lot more money than...
3741607	3743248	and the PS3.
3744029	3745350	I guess that's the way it goes.
3747191	3747792	I guess so.
3747872	3748932	I guess that's the way it goes.
3748992	3750654	I just heard stick and a carrot.
3752035	3759500	Well, yeah, because Microsoft being the stick and then the carrot being the money.
3760321	3765044	Hey, DarkSakura, what do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?
3767145	3768066	My ass!
3768967	3769367	Alright.
3770248	3770488	What?
3771238	3771578	What?
3771618	3773019	Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference.
3773320	3774220	I haven't seen Kung Pao.
3774240	3775001	You are a loser.
3775061	3776082	All right, sorry, Zaku.
3776102	3778244	I'm sorry I couldn't keep everybody on topic.
3778304	3783528	But granted, I don't want to debate the Sony-Microsoft thing anymore.
3784048	3786670	But you have to look at the writing on the wall.
3787491	3792895	Rockstar is basically going to have to start leaning towards one side over another.
3795038	3804340	Regardless of what's already been done in the past, and by extending the game beyond the disc... It's just a crazy cycle.
3804661	3810422	The companies are going to release the game on the console that has the most number of machines in the market.
3810662	3815323	But the console that's going to have the most number of machines in the market is going to be the one that has the good games on it.
3815363	3817443	So it all comes down to first-party games.
3818044	3819484	It all comes down to the first-party games.
3820308	3820728	Exactly.
3820848	3824749	Rockstar knows that the 360 has a bigger install base than the PS3.
3825770	3828391	Granted that the 360 had a one year head start.
3829391	3832372	And, you know, they didn't blow, they didn't take it for granted.
3833432	3842935	So, yeah, this is going, you know, it's just that they're saying, you know, Rockstar is just bullshitting when they're saying that their version, their PS3 version of GTA 4 is actually going to move consoles.
3843616	3844736	We shall see what happens.
3844916	3847197	It's just, it doesn't make sense.
3847837	3848077	All right.
3848493	3849754	Well, thank you very much for the call, Zaku.
3849774	3850714	We've got to get some more calls.
3851615	3851975	Bye-bye.
3852195	3852795	All right.
3852835	3854036	See you.
3854116	3857518	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3857598	3858638	Some comments from chat room.
3858678	3863681	GS191 says, Shit, at the end of the day, Take-Two Interactive is going to make a shit ton of money anyway.
3864061	3866683	Note, buy their stock before Grand Theft Auto 4 release.
3867303	3869544	I hope the game tanks, just to piss you all off.
3869904	3870865	I don't care if it tanks.
3870925	3872206	I don't give a shit about their stock.
3872246	3873326	The game's going to be awesome.
3873346	3874287	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3874307	3874647	Who's this?
3875307	3876808	Hello, this is Dr. Gnar.
3877149	3878169	Hi, Dr. Gnar.
3878209	3879030	What's on your mind?
3879831	3885715	I just wanted to prove to all the other guys listening that you can actually get a coin if you try hard enough.
3885795	3886376	That's right.
3886396	3888498	You just got to keep hammering the line and you can get in.
3888538	3889718	Well, I'm glad you got it.
3890079	3891240	Have you called our show before?
3892180	3893902	No, I've never.
3894502	3899066	I just thought this is my second show listening live from Mexico City.
3900148	3902950	Welcome, we like the worldly listeners, that's always fun.
3902990	3905292	How's things going in Mexico City?
3905552	3907813	How's the gaming scene in a place like Mexico City?
3908754	3913417	Well, it's pretty much like Southern California, where I've been a ton of times.
3914278	3921763	And pretty much all you have to do is get a lot of games, and there's really not that many people playing live.
3922103	3926686	I have to play with a bunch of guys from the US, so that's why I'm here.
3927655	3928096	There you go.
3928136	3931419	Well, hey, you meet a lot of folks here who like to play with folks around the world.
3931479	3932039	It's good times.
3932840	3935322	What type of games have you been playing recently?
3936943	3938865	Sadly, not the kind of games that I like.
3940146	3944029	I like role-playing games, but there's not that many more out there.
3944770	3947332	So right now I'm pretty much playing shoot-'em-ups.
3947552	3950075	Shadowrun's been my latest failure.
3950775	3954839	You, like me, must be more excited about Eternal Sonata than Halo 3.
3956004	3957285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3974266	3977588	I'm married, I have a couple of kids, so it's a pretty interesting gaming scene.
3977848	3984232	Well, unfortunately, I don't think you could apply for the show because you're in another country, and I think that brings a whole other issue into it.
3984452	3986333	But you're saying you wouldn't trade your wife for anything?
3987874	3995759	No, and that's already given since both my kids are starting into video games, and they're only three and five.
3995859	3998080	Well, what kind of games are you letting the kids play?
3999141	3999841	Mostly Wii.
3999941	4002343	I got them a Wii, and I have a bunch of games.
4003109	4010807	for kids, basically anything rated E. I have Shrek, I have Monster Sync, that kind of games.
4011502	4023486	You know, there was this guy I ran into at Fry's the other day, and he was looking at the Wii games, and he overheard myself and I think Shane talking to each other about the different games, and he could tell that we kind of knew stuff about games.
4023867	4028268	So he actually came up and asked me, he's like, what would be a good Wii game for me to get for the family?
4028308	4030589	And I'm like, well, who's playing the Wii, you or the kids?
4031029	4032730	And he said kind of something for all of us.
4033110	4035991	So I recommended Elebits and WarioWare.
4036331	4037392	Was that a good suggestion?
4037512	4037892	I don't know.
4037932	4038412	I couldn't think...
4039533	4043936	Zelda is the best game on the Wii, but I don't know if young kids would really get into that so much.
4043976	4046298	So I said Elebits and WarioWare.
4047338	4048299	WarioWare is good.
4049020	4049760	Excite Truck.
4050501	4052182	Yeah.
4053123	4053783	Vice Cities.
4054463	4056965	That's your suggestion, right, Loki?
4057085	4059827	They don't have Vice City on the Wii.
4060068	4060728	Get Scarface!
4061288	4061829	Godfather!
4062669	4063270	No Scarface.
4063723	4064664	and the Trauma Center.
4064744	4066725	Get them started on the path to surgery early.
4067065	4069787	I said Trauma Center is a really fun game, but I don't think kids will play it.
4069827	4072608	I just like watching the patients bleed because I'm no good at it.
4074009	4076391	But you know, it's funny you said you wouldn't trade your wife for anything.
4076451	4078252	I wouldn't inflict my husband on anyone else.
4080373	4080953	That's nice.
4081373	4081854	There you go.
4082434	4084855	Well, Dr. Nahr, thanks so much for calling in.
4084876	4086076	We appreciate hearing from you.
4086236	4089518	And I don't know if they celebrate it in Mexico, but Happy Father's Day nonetheless.
4090139	4090499	Thank you.
4090539	4090979	That's it.
4091459	4091940	We have it too.
4094321	4094882	See you later.
4094942	4095222	Take care.
4095262	4095822	Thanks for calling.
4096362	4096562	Bye.
4097002	4097282	Bye-bye.
4122381	4123481	Hey guys, it's Insanist.
4149949	4151951	Hello, Insanus.
4152091	4154533	I'm going insane just thinking about you.
4154573	4155314	What's on your mind, buddy?
4157075	4157516	Nothing.
4157636	4161639	You may all notice that I sound a lot like DMN when I'm not DMN.
4162440	4164662	Okay, so very well put.
4165883	4167965	Jamie took a PS3 and bludgeoned him to death.
4168225	4169907	It was a horrible funeral.
4171028	4176412	So you have officially retired or killed off DMN, and now we have Insanus instead.
4177393	4178034	Yes, I have.
4179734	4180655	That's your prerogative.
4180675	4183417	You know, Madonna wants everybody to call her Esther.
4183717	4185479	So you have every right.
4185519	4187481	And Prince wanted everybody to call him by that symbol.
4187681	4190383	I've called Madonna the same thing throughout her career, and that's a whore.
4191424	4198690	In Prince's defense, it had to do with the fact that his previous label owned the name Prince.
4199270	4202893	So he used the symbol in terms of protest until the contract was up and could get his thing again.
4203074	4205636	Has this show really come to discussing Prince?
4207216	4212579	He wore crocheted assless pants, and that's bravery.
4212679	4215581	This is what it sounds like when I cry.
4215621	4219843	So anyways, Rob, you need to explain something to your listeners.
4220184	4220504	Okay.
4221685	4223466	That you're not doing Orange Lounge Radio anymore.
4223486	4229149	I'm looking at this press release from CBS right here, and apparently you're the new host of The Price is Right.
4231335	4232456	I freaking wish.
4261414	4269838	will show perfectly for the new host of The Price is Right, and we will have somebody more feminine than Marker's Duties.
4271638	4276000	I don't know what to say, Insanist, but Plinko just moves me to tears.
4279302	4286925	No, however, I'm actually calling to raise some beef over the Church of England vs. Sony...
4288470	4294575	Sorry, I'm just playing a little bit of the Price is Right dance remix that I have.
4295415	4296496	Wait, let's get into the music.
4303502	4305824	See, I wanted to turn the Price is Right into a gay rave.
4305884	4308726	That's why I was not allowed to host it, sadly.
4310247	4312969	You just wanted those sparkling jackets.
4314570	4315751	Dude, Rod Roddy was the man.
4315791	4316652	Don't make fun of Rod Roddy.
4319224	4323387	I was actually going to call out the CBS executives and I'm just too fucking tired.
4325549	4332455	But I am up in arms over the Sony versus Church of England thing and how Sony is taking the whole thing.
4333096	4334997	Initially they weren't taking it seriously at all.
4335478	4340362	They were saying, oh, we're talking to the Church of England and Church of England was like, um, no.
4342463	4343464	No one's talking to us.
4343484	4346447	I think the Church of England's demands are a little bit harsh.
4347113	4355480	They want Resistance Fall of Man to be completely removed from the shelves and for them to completely redesign the level that the Church of Manchester is in.
4357801	4363066	I don't agree with that as much as I would love Sony to burn it out.
4367269	4372613	I would... It's kind of a... It's a high demand.
4373173	4375135	The Church of England has to understand that Sony is a business.
4376096	4376236	Um...
4377055	4379557	and they're saying, oh, likeness of a building, whatever.
4380297	4383819	Last I checked, I don't think buildings have likeness rights.
4384180	4388382	Yeah, and you know, isn't it kind of common to see famous landmarks in video games?
4388402	4391504	I mean, how many games are out there that involve the White House?
4392024	4396467	You know, or like in that alien shooting game, what was it, Destroy All Humans?
4396507	4397988	You could blow up the White House, you know?
4398428	4403590	Or how about all the movies out there that have New York City being destroyed?
4403630	4408151	Well, but usually, though, in a lot of those, you're getting the permits to shoot at those locations.
4408451	4411932	But I guess not always, because sometimes they shoot in Canada and make it look like the U.S.
4412792	4413813	Certain landmarks, they do that.
4413833	4417974	It's a fictional game that takes place in a fictional future that...
4419688	4426734	I agree the church has somewhat of their panties in a bunch, but it wouldn't pain Sony to go, look, sorry we pissed you off.
4426854	4428476	Our bad, but we're not going to recall the game.
4428796	4430577	Bill, sorry that you're offended by this.
4430838	4431438	Fuck off.
4434661	4437443	What would you like to see happen as a resolution, Insanist?
4439685	4447952	I would just like to see the church of England saying, oh, well, you should donate some money to a gun control education fund, because
4448393	4452455	Those of you who aren't aware, Manchester, England had a horrible, horrible gun problem.
4453496	4458839	I want to say a month and a half, two months ago, a 15-year-old kid was killed with a mistaken identity.
4458859	4459999	It was a gun crime.
4460019	4462000	The kid got killed execution style.
4462020	4464562	It was not something you like reading.
4464962	4469745	Well, then that's very unfortunate, and that sounds like a very fair resolution as well.
4470905	4473367	Sony donates a little money to charity, all is well.
4473447	4474107	Kiss and make up.
4475668	4475788	Yeah.
4478393	4479353	That's about it on that.
4480494	4482375	I would like to plug The Insanest Hour.
4482735	4483956	It's not STFU.
4484876	4488658	It's me making fun of stuff and swearing for an hour and playing music.
4489118	4489979	And there you go, Ashley.
4490099	4491440	And we should say it here on the show.
4491480	4496462	This all kind of went down while I was out of town and while the rest of the hosts were on vacation.
4496882	4500144	But STFU finally did, unfortunately.
4500644	4503706	So we're sad to see it go, but that's all right.
4504284	4508465	It was over things with my employer, who, as I've been adamant, will remain nameless.
4508485	4510246	I was actually going to come next week.
4510306	4511706	I had things come down where the checkbook said no.
4534623	4534863	I know.
4534943	4536324	It's, you know, money happens.
4536684	4537244	No, it's okay.
4537284	4540666	I think we're at a point now where we're actually going to have no guests, and that's kind of how we're going to do it.
4540706	4541966	It's just going to be the three of us next week.
4542007	4544248	But I'll tell you more about what's going to happen next week a little later in the show.
4545528	4546288	Well, fine.
4546569	4556013	Why don't you just act like you're better than everybody and clamp yourself in your stupid orange lounge room and do your own radio show for your fifth year anniversary and not share it with anybody else?
4556373	4557814	Oh, wait, you're going to hit it with the radio.
4558034	4559535	Yeah, I'll do that, actually.
4559755	4562656	And you know how else I can assert that I'm better than you, Insanist?
4563851	4564812	You're about to hang up on me?
4564932	4565112	Yep.
4565692	4565952	All right.
4566553	4571576	If you want to give us a call, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4571596	4572537	We'll do one more call.
4572577	4573217	I'm such a dick.
4574978	4577059	But it's Insanist or DMN or whatever.
4577640	4578240	The symbol.
4578260	4580081	He should have a symbol there.
4580482	4581222	Whatever you want to call him.
4581242	4584104	From now on, his name is Swirly Polka Dots.
4584264	4585505	Swirly Polka Dots.
4585925	4587786	Sega Swirl is his new name, actually.
4588307	4588947	Sega Swirl.
4591000	4593182	We're not actually getting any more calls, it looks like.
4593642	4595584	So maybe that's it.
4595684	4597365	I got a private message from Insanus.
4597385	4598146	Oh, I got a heart.
4598266	4599107	I got less than three.
4599727	4600127	Yay.
4601028	4603190	All right, well then I guess that's it since no more calls are coming in.
4603210	4604411	We'll go ahead and close up the Skype line.
4604431	4605652	We had a lot of calls tonight anyway.
4605672	4608174	I just thought I saw some other numbers popping up, but they must have stopped trying.
4608792	4609812	So that's about it.
4609892	4610673	We're going to wrap things up.
4610753	4615354	Let's go around and first ask if there's any last minute stories.
4615454	4617995	Anything last minute that wants to be brought up tonight.
4618635	4619975	Loki, you usually have something.
4620175	4620695	Yes, I do.
4623876	4626537	Anyways, so there's some interesting news coming out.
4626877	4628657	Diablo is getting a movie.
4629678	4631078	What the hell?
4631098	4638040	Apparently, Legendary Pictures, their website is listing Diablo movie as in development.
4639574	4645638	As well as a Clash of the Titans remake Oh lord Will they have the really bad dubbing like the first one?
4645698	4655224	And the World of Warcraft film Excellent Let's see what else Then again, Legendary Pictures did the new Batman, didn't they?
4655244	4666891	Yeah, I think so That was like a pretty fucking rad movie This may not be the end of the world Well, with the Halo 3 beta ending Something else had to take its place, right?
4667091	4667812	Going outside?
4668271	4671732	Halo 3's viral marketing campaign has taken its place.
4672332	4679573	And move over, I Love Bees, and welcome Adjundant Reflex.
4680394	4689776	And it's apparently this weird viral marketing campaign that they have going on, including people staying in the street with signs and websites with calendars and whatnot.
4690256	4691976	So if you want more info on that,
4693178	4695420	Why are they standing in the street with signs?
4695700	4699924	The people that are waiting for Halo 3 are playing Gears of War while they're waiting.
4700184	4701105	They're not outside.
4701145	4703547	This is part of the viral marketing campaign.
4704828	4710112	Ace Combat 6 is getting a limited edition flight stick bundle that's going to be coming out.
4710733	4720260	Bandai and Hori are teaming up to release it's going to have this really elaborate flight stick which I'm unaware of works for any other game other than Ace Combat 6 so
4721809	4723470	Matt Cosimani from...
4745057	4748060	IGN posted a while back about Halo on the DS.
4748100	4752064	Well, apparently in their latest podcast, they said, It's a real game.
4752084	4757108	We're going to lay down some ownage next week or soon afterwards, showing you guys that it's a real game.
4757589	4763074	So IGN will probably have info about Halo DS soon.
4763254	4764595	What the hell?
4766657	4767598	My thoughts exactly.
4768839	4769159	Who cares?
4773041	4786649	I mean, like, they're, like, I don't know, to me, the way you read that, and I don't know if that's the way you post it or if you belch or whatever, but it sounds like they're, like, kind of just, like, they're, like, we've got a big cock because we knew that Halo was really on the DS and we're going to prove it.
4786689	4787449	I mean, who cares?
4788129	4794313	If the game never came out, I mean, what, I'm supposed to look at, like, oh, look how this game was almost, like, completely bastardized.
4794333	4798135	Well, in other news, there was a video of Diablo for the Game Boy online.
4798415	4799015	I heard about that.
4799276	4799936	You know, whatever.
4801497	4801777	All right.
4802772	4804533	Uh, DarkSakura, you have anything last minute?
4807695	4810737	I'm sorry, is this show not living up to your expectations tonight?
4811398	4812718	I've had a headache most of the show.
4812898	4814239	Is this just, oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
4814900	4816901	Somebody screamed in my ear, both of you.
4817061	4817882	Take two of these.
4818622	4819142	Ah, Nuprin.
4819342	4819583	Little.
4819983	4820383	Yellow.
4820623	4820923	Different.
4821484	4825226	You did the Wayne's World reference version, didn't you?
4825746	4827868	Because the other one was Little Yellow Different Better.
4828548	4829188	Was the real commercial.
4829629	4829869	Anyhow.
4830887	4831168	Beer
4857210	4857770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4878767	4880429	and DarkSakura.com
4906616	4910920	So for part B, we're going to get out the dinner table like we're at Denny's or whatever diner.
4911701	4912461	Let's order some pizza.
4912481	4913062	Let's order pizza.
4913262	4919848	And we're going to open up the Skype line and we're going to have you guys call in and just talk shit with us for a few hours about games and everything.
4920148	4922810	And if you guys want to pass on your congratulations, that's cool too.
4922870	4925653	Whatever you want to do for, you know, it's going to be your show.
4925673	4927094	Man, I remember the first show though.
4927555	4928375	I know, some good times.
4928515	4933700	I was in this chair, passed out with a migraine.
4934482	4937424	And the second show, man, that was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room.
4938385	4942908	And Pat Charisse was in chat and says, yay, we can hear the same three people for an hour.
4943249	4945070	Well, we're hoping that that won't happen.
4945110	4950935	We're actually kind of hoping that maybe some folks might drop in on the Skype line that you wouldn't expect.
4951355	4951975	So who knows?
4952115	4955858	We're hoping to get some callers we may not usually get on the program.
4955898	4958120	That's what we're looking at for next week.
4958180	4959601	We should get Scott on the Skype.
4959621	4960282	That would be funny.
4960342	4960942	Possibly.
4961022	4962864	I mean, who knows who's going to call in next week.
4963064	4963224	So...
4964042	4964442	We'll see.
4965282	4974485	We're going to put the call out there, but we do want our listeners to get in on it, too, because even those folks that have, even the same three people that always call in, definitely make this show a part of what it is.
4975085	4979586	So if you've never listened live before and you want to get in, next week is an excellent chance to do that.
4979866	4984308	Again, we tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on our live 365 station.
4984348	4987748	More information can be found at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4987969	4991029	I do know that next week's discussion will be quite interesting.
4991489	4992890	After all, we are getting close to E3.
4994238	5002385	Are you saying that even though you got slapped on the wrist about something a while ago, possibly next week, you're going to spill some big-ass beans?
5003385	5003686	I don't know.
5003786	5003986	Maybe.
5004326	5004606	Maybe?
5004746	5005247	Thinking about it?
5006368	5007068	It's crossed my mind.
5007248	5007829	Crossed your mind?
5008189	5008669	Stay tuned.
5008689	5009310	That could be fun.
5010111	5010431	All right.
5011472	5014454	Anyhow, we're going to wrap it up for this week.
5014494	5018157	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
5018527	5020168	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
5020789	5026153	Explicit, sorry we didn't have a fourth mic or something so you can get in on the action more often, but we appreciate you being here as always.
5026173	5027093	It's all good.
5027353	5032537	And again, keep it up with the Wii cosplay and whatever other creative cosplays you come up with.
5033658	5036180	It'll show up on Anime Expo and SAC Anime as well.
5036780	5037301	Awesome.
5037321	5038121	When is SAC Anime?
5038642	5039902	It's July 13th through the 15th.
5041391	5042852	We want to make an appearance somehow.
5043232	5044413	I'm going to be there.
5045094	5046555	I'm actually staffed there now.
5046595	5047676	Can we do a panel or something?
5047916	5048616	Yeah, get us a panel.
5049016	5049717	I'll see what I can do.
5049737	5051838	I'll talk to the management.
5052099	5053440	Tell them you know internet celebrities.
5054320	5055361	I'll talk to them about it.
5055541	5056121	Don't lie.
5056322	5058483	They trust me a lot now.
5059124	5059764	Alright, sounds good.
5060324	5060945	Don't abuse it.
5062206	5062826	Exactly.
5063347	5064627	Want to ruin your rep real fast?
5064768	5065488	No, no, no.
5065588	5066148	I have a good rep.
5066189	5067029	I have a good rep with people.
5067049	5068470	This is really, really disgusting.
5068710	5069531	Alright, I know.
5069551	5070391	Loki.
5070732	5071012	Loki.
5071724	5072324	Your final thought.
5072524	5073285	And it smells bad.
5073585	5075826	Stay tuned for the afterbirth.
5077387	5078387	That's my final thought.
5078487	5080428	If you're listening live, otherwise you're screwed.
5080708	5081248	DarkSakura?
5082049	5088212	I feel really stupid because I deleted almost everything out of my FTP, including the banner for my live journal, so I have to go home and re-upload it.
5089873	5099337	The via was dying, so in three days my computer that was given to me by Vandalus is going to be up and running, and I need to think of a clever name for it.
5101603	5105845	My final thought is now I want ice cream.
5106426	5108347	I didn't want ice cream a couple hours ago, but now I do.
5108367	5109808	I have chocolate mint pudding at home.
5110828	5111208	Sounds good.
5112609	5112910	All right.
