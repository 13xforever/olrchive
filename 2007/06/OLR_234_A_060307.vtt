Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Molochi

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, June 3rd, 2007, rumors surfaced about Mario Kart Wii,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
lizard strikes against gold farmers for WoW,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
and a famous 80's movie is about to be made into a PC game.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
You should know by now that we're that podcast dedicated to video games,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
We'll be here with you for the next few hours in two parts of a show

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
to talk about the latest and what's going on in the gaming world.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Say hello also to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Beer!

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Beer! It's what's tasty.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
That was my weekend, was beer.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Actually, I don't really care for much beer,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
except for Guinness, which isn't a beer, it's stout.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
No, no, you need to have Newcastle.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I've had Newcastle, I like Newcastle. Newcastle is permissible.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
I actually got my husband to like a beer.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
What's that?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
He likes Killian's Red.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
See, if I'm gonna drink, I'm gonna drink something that's actually going to get me drunk,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
therefore beer doesn't work.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Depends on what you drink.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, I mean Guinness.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Chimay.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Well, maybe.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Chimay.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Anyhow, suddenly we've become the food and beverage podcast.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Over there chomping on some food is the one and only Loki.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
It's dinner, that's what it is.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
And Loki's mic needs to be on.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
You think after five years he'd know this?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
I expected it to be on for me.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Is it beef?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
That's what I have servants for, is a turn on the mic.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh yes, let's forget the OLR interns, of which we have none.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Is it beef?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
It is beefy.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
So it's for dinner.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
Great, so we have beer, beef sandwiches from Quiznos, toasty...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
It smells very good.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
It does.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I had a burrito.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I had a fish burrito.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
I had a burger from Chili's.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
I did a massage today and got paid with fish.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Alright, we'll let the listeners take that however they want.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
Speaking of listeners, if you're listening live here on this Sunday evening, because

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
we do record live every Sunday night at OrangeloungeRadio.com, you can join our chatroom.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
OrangeloungeRadio.com is the place to be, it'll take you right into our chatroom thanks

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
to Java.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
But if you need the information about IRC, it's all on there as well.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
You just connect to Game Surge and Channel Orange Lounge.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Anyhow, let's get into the show.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
We always like to start it off with a little bit of how is your gaming week?

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
So we'll start it off with Dark Sakura.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
How was your gaming week?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
More Marvel Ultimate Alliance and more Pinball, same as usual.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Haven't you beat the damn game yet?

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
No, because I keep taking my time playing it, and then I go back and start over to do

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
the levels with other characters to try to figure out all the funny crap they're saying,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
but usually I just play with Deadpool and Iron Man.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Gotcha.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, I actually need to completely redo the Mandarin level with Iron Man because I had

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
him in the Ultimate outfit, so it's like, dude, you're a different universe, I don't

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
know who you are.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
I was actually tempted to buy Marvel Ultimate Alliance the other day.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Get it on Xbox 360, because I am.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
But see, I was also tempted to buy Dead or Alive Extreme 2, so therefore something's

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
obviously wrong with me.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Boobies.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I need to save money.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Video games are expensive.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Boobies!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Video games are really expensive.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I know.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
We don't talk about that enough on this show, but they are freaking expensive.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I have my Pokemans.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
I've been going to the gym, I'm back to going to the gym now that my doctor's

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
giving me the okay, so I get on the recumbent bike and play with my Pokemans.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
What's a recumbent bike?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
The recumbent bike is where you sit down like you're in a chair.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Sounds dirty.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, you know a standard stationary bike has you upright.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Recumbent means leaning back.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, okay.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
So I go on the recumbent bike.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
So it's like one of those boats that you pedal like.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Or those lame-ass bikes that you see people pedaling.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
They're sitting back and it looks stupid and unstable.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Oh, on the streets and stuff.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
It actually works out your legs, though, a different way.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Because I have to work back into my whole routine, I'm doing the recumbent bike so

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I can sit down and play with my Pokemans, because you cannot play Pokemans on the elliptical.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, that would be kind of tough.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
You can't even freaking read on the elliptical.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's like, I've got to move my arms, too.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Shit.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
But you could listen to great podcasts such as this one you're listening to right now.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Why would I want to listen to us?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I don't know.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I listen to us every Sunday.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I don't know.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Maybe you want to listen to the playback to see what you can do better.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
I do everything perfect.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I don't know.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
There might be some emailers out there that beg to differ.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Our emailers say that I'm fabulous.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
We haven't gotten a good Dark Sakura hate mail in a long time.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
This is because they know I'll kill them.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Get on that.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Hey!

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
All right.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Anyhow, have I pinged out of chat?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Chat room hasn't moved for me in a few minutes.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
That's concerning.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
I'll check on that while Loki talks about his gaming week.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Which, did it involve going to the gym?

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
I don't remember if I did go to the gym this week or not.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I think I did one day.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh, okay.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
One day.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I don't like to, so I don't do it.

05:09.000 --> 05:15.000
Anyways, so this week I played a lot of weird stuff, other than the usual stuff.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I played more Super Paper Mario.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
And to be honest, it's getting very repetitive towards the end of the game.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Almost like they've ran out of ideas what to do.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
It's like, well, let's just throw a hundred of these towards you.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
And how about let's make you replay levels again.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And, oh, that's fun.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
So I'll be very glad to see this game over.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
And I'll be very glad to return it for some store credit.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Because it's not worth playing again.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Even with all the side crap, not worth it.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Um, let's see.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Then I played my PlayStation 3.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Yes, dusted that thing off.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And then did a nice old firmware update.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
And then created myself a Japanese account to download folklore.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And I played it, and it's pretty fun.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
Although, since it's in Japanese, I have no idea what the storyline is.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
What is this game all about? Because I know nothing about it.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Well, I'm not really sure.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Like I said, because it's all in Japanese.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
But there's two different characters you get to play as.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
I played through as the guy in the game.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
And what you're doing is kind of stealing the souls of these critters that you kill.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
Like different enemies, almost like in Final Fantasy.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
And you gain abilities that they have.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
And you use those as your attacks throughout the game.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
So, once you've gotten some abilities and stuff,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
you can go and kill larger things and gain their abilities.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
But what's kind of neat about it is, once you've killed it,

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
you actually have to use the six axis tilt stuff in there

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
to actually physically rip the soul out of whatever it is that you're doing.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
So, it's kind of neat.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
But then again, there's this one that I couldn't figure out how to do.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I could get it for about five minutes before it finally ripped out of its body.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
But I'm sure there's something that I'm just not getting in the translation of the game.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Speaking of all this shaking and body parts and stuff,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
what do you know about the Mortal Kombat Armageddon on the Wii?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Because I'm really tempted to get it.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
It looks awesome and apparently it's pretty easy to play because of the controls.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Really?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yeah.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I'm tempted to play.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Plus it has motor combat and you can use your...

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
That's true.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
But I guess it's supposed to be sort of controlled almost like...

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Not necessarily...

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
I guess like a little bit.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
I played the one on PlayStation 2 and it was decent.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
There was a lot of stuff they crammed into one,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
considering it was on the current gen consoles or whatever.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
They really crammed a lot into it.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
So, I'm interested in checking out the one on the Wii.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I hear it's pretty cool though.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
Just some of the descriptions and they have a little gameplay video there

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
showing how you would play the game and stuff.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
It looked very simple.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Even I would be able to pick it up.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I was looking at that list of fatalities that went out to the internet this week.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
For some reason, we get Midway press releases all the time,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
which is pretty much the same things you end up seeing

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
because game blogs just copy paste what they're sending out in the press release.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
So, we get those same things, but we never get free games from Midway.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Ever.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Right?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I do.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Oh, well, lucky you.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I mean, yeah.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I got, let's see, what, Spy Hunter?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Whoo!

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Rampage!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Whoo!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Actually, I take that back.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
I did get free games from Midway once

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
because there's this very sweet gal that worked there that I met at some trade show

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
and she hooked me up with the classic game archives, which I really like.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Midway put out some of my favorite stuff in the 80s.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
So, the only thing that I complain about, about those classic compilations,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
is that I have yet to see Journey, the arcade game, show up in one of them,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
even though it ran on the same hardware as Timber and all that other stuff.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, you've got the licensing rights and stuff.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Who cares?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Anyways.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
If they can get Tron on Xbox Live, I can get Journey on Xbox Live.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Stop.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Don't stop believing.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I will hold on to that feeling.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You do that, sir.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
So, then I also played, well, I downloaded a bunch of Japanese demos.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
I downloaded the Hot Shots Golf 5 demo, so I haven't played that,

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
or, I guess, Mino no Golf 5.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
And then I also downloaded some weird, I don't even know what the fuck it is.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
It's kind of like their mascot in Japan, like some cat thing that you have.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
You basically raise it and it reads you Japanese news or something.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Is that the white cat with the face that was the...

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
I know what you're talking about.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
The only problem is, in order to play that game,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I had to download some update or something, and it took, like, an hour to download.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
So, I got very bored with that real quick.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
That cat was actually based off of old text emoticons.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I can imagine.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
Then, there was also, I played on the PSP.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Of course, Grand Theft Auto by City Stories.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That's not getting old yet.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
And I actually tried out B-Boy, which is a game that's been out in Europe for a while now.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And it's just like it sounds.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
It's basically a breakdancing game.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Not exactly like Bust-A-Mover or anything like that, but it's pretty cool.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It takes a lot to get used to the game, though,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
because there's a lot of transitioning and stuff,

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
a lot of rhythm stuff in there as well.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But it's pretty fun.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
So, I've got that.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
And then, what else have I been trying to play?

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I have the full version of LocoRoco.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I haven't touched that yet.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
And then, also, Puzzle Quest.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I've got that on the PSP.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And then, I got Nellie, the DS one.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
So, she's been playing that a little bit.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
But she doesn't really get the game, but she's been playing it.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
And then, of course, Earth Defense Force 2017.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I've been trying to finish that game up.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
We're almost done.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
We almost got all the weapons on it.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm just trying to finish some of these harder levels.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
And, let's see.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
Other than that, I think I haven't really been playing too much else on the PS3.

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
I did happen to dump, though, a copy of Kung Pao to my PlayStation 3 hard drive,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
just to test out, you know, putting movies on there.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
And it's a bitch to figure out how to do it,

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
because it requires you, and I didn't realize this until, you know, after lots of reading,

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
but apparently, in order for the PlayStation 3 to see your movies,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
you have to have a folder on whatever drive you're using,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
like a jump drive or something that's named Video, or Videos, I believe.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And you have to put the file in there.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
So, I didn't know that, and so I've been kind of banging my head against the wall

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
trying to figure out how to get this thing to work,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
because I'm like, well, I converted it, right?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So, finally, I figured out that's what I needed to do.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
It works like a charm now, so.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But, pretty awesome.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Awesome.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
So, lots of hacking and stuff in your wake, it sounds like.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
Lots, yes, and this is only going to be a gateway to putting porn on the PS3 now, so.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
All right, I'm glad you, at least you have a goal in mind.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
That's good to have goals.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
You've got to have goals.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Looking at the chat room for some feedback here, SSJ100Matt says,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
That's not a surprise, Loki. It's the same with the PSP.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
But, see, that's the thing with the PSP is I put it in the video folder for the PSP,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
because the PSP is even worse than the PS3 as far as how strict, you know,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
what folders and the file names and stuff like that.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
So, I thought, okay, well, I'll just throw it in there and see if that works.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Nope, that didn't work either.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
So, I actually had to use, it was funny, my camcorder that I have,

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
because the batteries don't work in it anymore.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
So, I just plugged that in, and now it's a 20 gig jump drive.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
TheRobD in chat says, The PS3 is a gateway for porn.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
And, by the way, the PS3 is fucking easy to download demos of the Japanese accounts.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It's so easy to create one.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
There's no restrictions whatsoever, and you can download all your games.

12:40.000 --> 12:46.000
Just like the Xbox 360, anything you download on the Japanese accounts is playable on all accounts.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Nice.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
It's easy.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
All right, good tip.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
My gaming week was pretty short. There wasn't a lot to it.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
I've been playing a lot more World of Warcraft.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
I hit level 55. I've been grinding a lot this week, trying to get to Outlands.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I want to get to 58 very bad, because a lot of the guild, which, by the way,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
our guild blew up in the past couple of weeks.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
We have tons more people on the guild, though.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I played.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
I know, I saw you on the other night.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah, I forgot to say that I played.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, for like half a second, though, because then Shane kicked me off my computer,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
because he wanted to get on and kick people out of the guild or whatever,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
because Shane is actually the guild leader.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
I didn't get kicked.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
So, he was a tyrant.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
He booted three people one night, but it was a joke.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
It was funny.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
It was funny.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
So, yeah, I've been working on that, because a lot of the guild is in Shane,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
and some of them are in Outlands now, and they won't shut up about how awesome

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
the Outlands are and how they're never going back to the old world.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
So, I'm working on it, trying to get there.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
You went to Outworld?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Is that Mortal Kombat or Outlands?

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Sorry, I got my Mortal Kombat mixed up with my...

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
No, you said Outlands.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Did I?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I said Outworld.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I wouldn't surprise me if I screwed something up.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I usually do.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
But then, besides World of Warcraft, I've been spending a whole lot of gaming time

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
playing something on the Wii.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Anybody?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Actraiser?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
That's right.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I've been playing Actraiser all freaking week.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I love Actraiser.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm so happy the game finally came out on Memorial Day,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
because Actraiser needed its own holiday.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
It's that freaking good.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
So, I was very happy.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
So, for those that were wondering if I was happy that finally Actraiser came

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
to the Virtual Console, yes, I'm very pleased.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Perfect translation of the Super Nintendo game.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Same music I love.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
Same easy-ass game I remember that's not challenging one bit.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
You can kind of play through it in one sitting if you have some time.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
But I love it.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
I love it.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
All right.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
So, why don't we get into some housekeeping, then we'll get into some news.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
First off, excuse me, in housekeeping, June 10th, which is next week,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
there's no show.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
There will be no live show, and there will be no podcast.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
We mentioned this at the end of our show that we taped live last week at Fanime,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
but just a reminder, there is no show next week.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Very sorry to the live listeners and the podcasters,

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
but since I'm traveling, it's going to kind of screw up the rhythm of everything,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
and I'm gone for so long that we can't pre-taper anything as well.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
So, that's that.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
But I will be in New York City for some of the East Coasters that want to meet up,

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
and we're looking at doing something on Sunday afternoon-ish.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
So, check the forums for more details or the live journal.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
So, sorry to the live listeners, because I know the live listeners kind of got

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
screwed last week because we did our thing live at Fanime,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
but yeah, unfortunately, we won't have a show next week.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
But we will be back on June 17th, and that should be a fun show.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
And then June 24th is the fifth anniversary show of Orange Lounge Radio,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
the official fifth anniversary.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
But I should mention that the live station,

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
which went up a little bit earlier than we actually did a live show,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
because remember, our station was up for a little while to promote that we were

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
going to be doing a live show back in 2002.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Our live station turned five years old this week on May 30th,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
so happy birthday to the live station.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
But we'll be officially celebrating on the 24th.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
How? I don't know.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
But I should say about the live station,

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
in a nod to how we kind of launched ourselves,

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
the old playlist from 2002 with the dance mania music and all that

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
is back in rotation.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
So that's kind of fun for those folks that listened to OLR a long time ago

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
or wanted to know what it used to sound like,

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
except you have to remember it was on a dial-up stream when it first started.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
The audio quality was horrible.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
So you're actually getting the old playlist with the new quality,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
so it's kind of cool.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
So that's that.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Visit ORANGELONITARADY.COM if you want more information.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
And of course everybody in chat is kind of crying.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Chainsaw Juggling says boo.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Shadow Charlie says since I'm traveling also,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I won't have to worry about it.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
There you go.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Sorry guys, but surely you understand.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
We need vacations too.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
All right, so let's get into some gaming news.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
And there's some interesting news, not surprising at all.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
But according to the website Jute France,

16:47.000 --> 16:51.000
they have run into a credible rumor, they say,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
that says that Nintendo's going to drop the bomb at EA,

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
or not EA, E3, mini E3 I guess,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
that they're going to be announcing a brand new Mario Kart game for the Wii.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
I mean, come on, it's only a matter of time

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
before a Mario Kart game comes out for the Wii.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Hopefully it's not part of the arcade game, but who knows.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
The other rumor is that there's going to be some new hardware news as well.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Whether this be like a revision to the current Wii hardware,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
something altogether new,

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
or possibly, you know, I'm thinking maybe it's a DVD playback,

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
something like that, but no idea.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
I mean, obviously there's going to be some announcements at E3,

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
but, you know, Mario Kart if that happens, I'm not too surprised.

17:35.000 --> 17:43.000
Besides, this is why I buy every damn system that Nintendo puts out for Mario Kart.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I mean, it seems like a foregone conclusion to me.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
I mean, obviously this game is coming out on the Wii at some point, right?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
It's just a matter of time.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
That's like saying a Mario game is coming out on a Nintendo system.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And then the, uh, okay? Yeah.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Of course there's a Mario game coming out.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Alright, you guys heard it here first.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
There's going to be a new Zelda game coming out on the Wii at some point.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
We don't know much more about it, but there will be another Zelda game on the Wii.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So Mario beat that to that, I think.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
God damn it.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Alright, you heard it here first.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
Final Fantasy XIV will be coming out to some console at some point.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Absolutely definitive news.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Wouldn't it be funny if that was a PC game?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
That wouldn't be a console.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Stop trying to screw our exclusive news, you bastard.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
Alright, speaking of the, you know what's funny about,

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
I was trying to figure out if that was the same site that a long time ago,

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
it was like in 2005, I got an email from some French website about E3,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
but they actually didn't mean to send it to me.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
They meant to send it to some staffer that had a very similar name to me,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
like it was a missent email to my Gmail box.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
It was the weirdest thing ever.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
But I ended up writing the guy back, and he spoke English luckily,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
and I ended up giving the site pictures from E3.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
I don't know if it was the same site.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
I know it was like a French Nintendo only site,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
because they only used the pictures from the Nintendo booth

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
that I took that year.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
It was so interesting.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Anyway, not that anybody cares,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
but this whole thing kind of made me think about that.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Well, that's special.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Stop looking at me funny.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I hate you.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I'm not looking at you funny.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Yes, you are.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
No, I'm not.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Alright.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
You are too.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
No.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Alright.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
I thought you were going to say Wee Wee.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
What did you say?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
No, it would be Mae Wee.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
The French site is not Wee Wee.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Oh my God.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
Anyhow, also talking about Nintendo and Virtual Console,

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
obviously I was very happy that Actraiser was like the 99th Virtual Console title to be released,

19:36.000 --> 19:41.000
but that means that this Monday the 100th Virtual Console title will be released,

19:41.000 --> 19:46.000
and they've already announced it's going to be Zelda II The Adventure of Link.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
So there you have it.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
So that is coming out on, I believe, what, June 4th?

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Am I one of the only people that doesn't like that game?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Yes.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Well, you know what?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
No, you're not, because I've been reading game blogs,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
and a lot of people have been kind of saying like,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
oh, it's one of the weaker Zelda games in the franchise.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
No, that was the CDI.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
It was just different, but if you think about it,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
weren't all the sequels on Nintendo really different?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
Super Mario Bros. 2, very different from 1, yes?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Super Mario Bros. 2 was not Super Mario Bros.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Right, it was the whole...

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
There was a Super Mario 2 in Japan.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Doki Doki Panic or whatever.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Right.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
That was just like the first one.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I didn't say all that international garbage.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I said here in the U.S.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
But the Zelda game was released in Japan as a Zelda sequel.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Okay, how about this?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Simon's Quest.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Completely different from the first Castlevania.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
That is true, but you can...

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
And completely better.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
True.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
I have to agree with that.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
It was better than the first, you know,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Demon Castle Dracula.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Oh, whatever, Miss Prim and Proper.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Whatever.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Miss, I play nothing but import games my entire life.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
I do not play nothing but import games.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
All right, so there you go.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, the Rob D says, well, excuse me, Dark Sakura.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
I want to make that a sound file.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I need to find that old clip from the old 80s Zelda.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Just replace Princess with Dark Sakura.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Or leave it at Princess.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It would be appropriate.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
That's right.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
Pay me my respect.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
So there you go.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Nintendo is putting out Zelda 2, the Adventure Link,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
and blah, blah, blah.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
They're bragging that the internet connection range is 40%.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
They're more happy, though, for our friends in the U.K.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
For the European Virtual Console, I should guess I should say Europe.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
But there are going to be some pretty fun stuff coming out over on the Virtual Console.

21:27.000 --> 21:32.000
You get Streets of Rage 2, which I love the Streets of Rage games.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
They're really fun.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
That's because Dark Sakura has Rage.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I do.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Well, you're unlucky.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
You can actually play it over here.

21:39.000 --> 21:45.000
Also, another Mega Drive game to be out is ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Yeah, I like ToeJam & Earl, too.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
That game was really fun.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Boy, they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for Genesis games, aren't they?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
No, it was a good game.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
And then Kid Chameleon was actually a game that I played partly through, anyway.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
And then coming from the TurboGrafx-16,

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
it looks like there's World of Sports Competition,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
which is a little shit.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
And that's about it.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Are you saying that just because it's a sports game?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Because there's some pretty awesome old-school sports games I'm waiting for.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I did not like World of Sports Competition.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It ranked right there below Keith Courage.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
However, now that I have Act Racer,

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
now what Virtual Console game will I complain about?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Well, obviously, there's The Guardian Legend,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
which I will be complaining about forever.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
But since that doesn't seem as realistic as this one,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
I want Blades of Steel on Virtual Console.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Hecka bad, Blades of Steel.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
If you're listening, Konami, Nintendo, make it happen.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Thank you.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Let's see, also looking in the chat room,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
they're still talking about Zelda II.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Jack Ransom says,

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
Remember when Zelda II came out on the European Virtual Console in January?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, they got it a long time ago, so did Japan.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
We've been having to wait this whole time.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
Rama says Zelda II was underrated and by far was one of the better titles.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
No, it wasn't.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
No, it wasn't.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Yes, it was!

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
It was not one of the better titles.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
It was okay, but it was like...

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I will say it was pretty good.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
His sword looked like a fucking dagger throughout the whole game.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
It was weird.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't know.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
I have found some fun hacks for that game, though.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Hmm.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
Like the penis hack.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
I remember I got stuck on like the fifth part of the game

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
where I couldn't figure out jumping down the...

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
What was it, the chimney?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Where you had to climb up on top of the house,

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
but you had to get the double jump to do it.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I think, yeah.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Yeah.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I actually ended up...

23:41.000 --> 23:49.000
I don't know how, but I skipped random levels on that.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I'll probably download it.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
I need to burn through this last 1200, you know, points.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Yes, I said penis.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Shut up.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
I was looking on a virtual console and there's like nothing I want.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
I need like Paper Mario or maybe Super Mario RPG.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Preferably Super Mario RPG.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
Hey, you never know if Squeenix put Actraiser on there finally.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
There's always a chance.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
There's a chance.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
What about the regular Mario Kart, not Mario Kart 64?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
That needs to come on there.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Well, if it's true there's a Mario Kart Wii in the future,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I would think they would time that around the release of Mario Kart Wii, right?

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, I guess I gotta wait until August, too, for all the Metroid games.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
GS68, by the way, stop doing the freaking color over your text,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
but you do make a good point.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
I did have the best ending thing when you died.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Game over, Return of Ganon.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
That's right, when you died it would say,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Game over, Return of Ganon, he's killed everybody,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
he's murdered the children, he's raped the babies,

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
and it's all because of you.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
And next time you do the colored, you know, text like that,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm gonna kick you.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Wonder Dog Harold wants to know

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
when the heck Zombie Ate My Neighbors is coming to the virtual console.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Oh my God, that was the best game ever.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Hostile One wants RC Pro-Am.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
That's a good choice, but that's a rare game, right?

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I want Fester's Quest.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
That's the most random title to me.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Hey, it was good, Blaster Master.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
No it wasn't.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
We need Blaster Master.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
Oh, fuck Blades of Steel, I want Blaster Master.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Never mind, scratch my earlier comment.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Blades of Steel can fucking wait, I want Blaster Master.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
And, Blaster Master has to have the grenade trick.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Every time, yeah, yeah, the way you pause it,

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
over and over on the big jellyfish guy and some of the other bosses.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
And it explodes him faster.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Okay, here's the thing though,

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
is that like every time the virtual console comes up,

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
we keep bitching and whining about the games we want to see.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
So, let's move on, shall we?

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
They also need to change the way I can find the games on the virtual console

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
because this ghetto JavaScript shit is lame.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Why don't you tell Fire Bulma to go to hell?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
He said Blades of Steel is better than Blaster Master.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Go to hell.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, go to hell.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Go to hell and burn there.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And roast some marshmallows too.

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
Well, R has got to be one of the only video game podcasts out there

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
that just totally tells their listeners to go to hell

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
when we disagree with them.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
That's because we're friends.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
I know.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
And everybody else is telling them to go to hell too.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Yay, mom mentality.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
We also need to get yo-noid because I was like,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
oh, you know what else was cool?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Mutant erasers.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Cool spot.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
We'll just get a whole bunch,

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
we'll just have one week where it's all product placement.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Can we talk about new games, please?

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
No, let's talk about Ubisoft because they like to port over crappy games.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Go to hell.

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
So Ubisoft admits that they were over-porting some of their GameCube games

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
to the Wii, or not necessarily GameCube games, but Xbox and you name it.

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
I mean, with such wonderful games as Far Cry Vengeance,

26:47.000 --> 26:53.000
which, two-player multiplayer deathmatch, that's uber lame.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
Okay, uber lame.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
Prince of Persia Rival Swords, which is just two thrones all over again.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I thought you were going to say Rival Schools, and I'm like,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
that would be great.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
No, not Rival Schools.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
And then, of course, they may apologize now,

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
but Driver Parallel Lines is coming out later on in June,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
so they're still not done that.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
And then, of course, there's also the Monster 4x4 World Circuit,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
which is a crappy Xbox game.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
Then there was also that GT game, which was also a GameCube game,

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
that also sucked.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Just stop porting over crappy games.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Seriously, make some new stuff, and make it better than Red Steel.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
I mean, was anyone really surprised by this news that Ubisoft kind of admitted,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
yeah, we just ported over some of our old shit.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
We were in a hurry to capitalize on all this stuff.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Ubisoft, thank you for sucking.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean, these games were bad for even GameCube games.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
They were crappy.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
But Wii Remote Control, Wii.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah, I liked Far Cry, you know, on the Xbox 360.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
On the Wii, it was a whole different game.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
It was just ew.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
All right, well, boo to you Ubisoft,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
and usually you'd think we'd put the FUs of the Week right here,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
but we saved it for later.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
I'm looking in chat.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
They're still talking about Virtual Console, but I love this comment.

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
The Rob D says, we need Miss World 96 Nude on the Virtual Console,

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
which is one of the greatest MAME games you could possibly play on that emulator.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
It's fabulous.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Is that the one where it's like kicks, but then at random points?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
That's Gals Panic.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
No, but there's one, and then it flips over to the real demon face

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
with the blood pouring down his face.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Everybody move your body.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
It's like this really horrible techno song.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah, that's the game.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
That's my favorite game on that MAME emulator ever,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
because it's so random.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
You have all these pictures of MAME, MAME, whatever, right?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Well, the E stands for emulator.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Whatever, so I'm being redundant.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
It's like ordering a cheese quesadilla. Deal with it.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Right?

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
So anyway, this is the best game ever.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
Please, ask your parent's permission, though, if you're under 18,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
because you do see titties in it.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Or sneak.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
I hope that I didn't say that.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
All right, yeah, the chat room's going to look for the link there.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
See? Kind of love the chat.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
But I want to say Rob D also says this.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
He says, Skye, if you yell Dark Sakura at some point soon,

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
I'll have the Excuse Me Dark Sakura clip made in 10 minutes or so.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
So we're going to see this unfold live while we're taping here.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
So let me give you my best Dark Sakura.

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
Well, excuse me, Dark Sakura.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
That was awful.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
That was awful. You want one more?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I don't care.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Excuse me, Dark Sakura.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Dark Sakura.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
How about my foot?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
You know, kicking you in the head.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Hopefully that gave Rob D something to work with.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
There you go.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
By the way.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Yes.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Shut up.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
We'll talk about Mario Party 8.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Has anyone played Mario Party 8 yet?

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
No.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I've heard mixed reviews on it.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
I've heard some people say it was good

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
and some people, like reviewers, saying it sucked.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
But the real people I talked to said it was good.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So I'm not sure what to believe.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
I haven't played it yet.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
But there it is. Mario Party 8 is out on the street.

30:23.000 --> 30:26.000
But the reason why we're bringing this up, that's not newsworthy.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
We've already talked about that.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
What is newsworthy is that folks are trying to make

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
backup copies, quote unquote, they're making backup copies of the game

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
as they've made backup copies of other games.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
But their backup copies of Mario Party 8 aren't working.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
They're not working with the modded Wii units.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
So has it been possible that Nintendo has come up with a workaround for this?

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I don't know.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Or perhaps the Wii has realized that it's such a crappy game that it doesn't want to play it.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
It's like, I've become smarter thanks to modding.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
What is this shit that you're trying to insert into me?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Begone!

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
Let's see, JVMon says, I have it, Sky, it's fun.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Gerardimo says, but really boring to play by yourself.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Well, yeah, I mean, that's just Mario Party. It's a party game.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
It's just like, I don't know, Rayman's Raven Rapids is kind of boring to play by yourself.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
Fireboma says, because it's Mario Party, it's the same game being rehashed

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
over three different platforms and only remotely changes when it moves to another system.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
Yeah, but the Wii, Wii-bo, Wii.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I don't know, we'll see.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
And BlackDevilerX asks, Sky, are you going to be Princess Peach?

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
Hell yeah, I always play Princess Peach in the games because Peach is the winner.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
She says so herself.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Well, then it must be true.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Right, it must be true.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Let's talk about some other games that are going to be coming out soon

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
besides Mario Party 8, which is already out.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
Let's talk about upcoming games. We'll start over in Europe.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
Your mom, the game, is coming out. No, seriously.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
Actually, Loki is coming out on PC on the 4th, which has already passed.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Sorry.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
No, wait, that's tomorrow, isn't it?

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
Well, it's already passed by the time you guys get it.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
That's also Nellie's birthday, by the way.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I know. I was going to tell her happy birthday because my live journal told me.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Also coming out, though, on the 8th is Brothers in Arms DS,

32:17.000 --> 32:23.000
Forza Motorsport 2, Halo 2 Vista Edition for PC, of course,

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
because Vista, you know, gives people headaches,

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
Mercury Meltdown Revolution on Wii, Pac-Man Rally,

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
Pangaea Golf with Style on Wii,

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
Trion Cube, and Wartec Senko Noronde.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
Why is it coming out with the Japanese name in Europe?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Because that's actually, no,

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Senko Noronde was the name that it was in Japan,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
but they added that Wartec to the front of it because that makes people want it more

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
because it's got the word war in it.

32:53.000 --> 32:59.000
Like, ooh, Wartec! Well, in that case, that must be a war game or something.

32:59.000 --> 33:05.000
I guess. Maybe it's just that people like to have something.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
It beats their last. I forget what the name before it was

33:08.000 --> 33:13.000
because there was, like, Battlescape Senko Noronde was, at one time,

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
a name possibility for it.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
How does it feel that you have a game named after you coming out?

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
I've seen screenshots of it. It's just like fucking Ragnarok.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Oh, goody.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Well, it's...

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
It's definitely not about me because you wouldn't be able to contain such awesomeness in the game like that.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
I can understand MMO, but, you know.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
SSJ100Matt says there is a code in the Loki game to unlock a Tingle costume.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
So, be on the lookout.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
That's reason enough to get it, I think.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
One of these days, Loki, you watch. We're going to drug you and put you in the costume.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Yeah, whatever.

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
Anyways, so, this week we see the release in the United States

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
for Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition on the PlayStation 2 and PC.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Also on PC and coming to the 360, Call of Juarez,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
which is pretty awesome.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
First-person shooter Western game.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Hospital Tycoon for the PC.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
Dragon Ball Z Haru Kannaru...

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
That's like a tongue-quister right there.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Haru Kannaru, I guess.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Densetsu DS.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
And basically just, you know, Dragon Ball Z RPG on the DS.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Or is it a fighting game? Can't remember.

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
Anyways, Planet Puzzle League coming to the DS.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
Another, what was that, one game?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Ah, whatever. Another rip-off of another puzzle game.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
PuzzleScape coming to the PSP.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
And then, of course, the Sims 2 H&M stuff.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
It would have been funny if it was S&M stuff.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
More Sims 2 stuff?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
Yeah.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
More? What is this, their 11th expansion? Geez.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Alright.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
Yeah, the H&M fashion stuff.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
Alright, well, moving on to Japan.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
What's coming out over there?

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
On June 7th, Harvest Moon for the Wii comes out.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
Because, you know, you just can't have a Nintendo system without a Harvest Moon game on it.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
So there you go.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End, the Japanese version of that,

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
coming out on June 7th as well, also on the Wii.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, not much until the 14th,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
but that's when Ninja Gaiden Sigma comes out, so look for that.

35:31.000 --> 35:38.000
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, the Magician's Academy, also Wizardry X2.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
The Wonder Price, I guess, is coming out there.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
Or maybe that's just called Wonder Price because it's discounted.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That would make a lot more sense, wouldn't it?

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
Also coming out, because I first read it, I thought it said Wonder Prince, but I guess not.

35:50.000 --> 35:57.000
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, you have Kabu Trader Shun is coming out from Capcom.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
Kazujin Taisen coming out from Nintendo.

36:00.000 --> 36:06.000
And also another version of Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End coming out on the Nintendo DS.

36:06.000 --> 36:12.000
Also Yoshi's Island pouches for your DS are coming out if you like Yoshi Island.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Not a game, but accessories.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
You really want to insert your DS into Yoshi.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
That's right.

36:19.000 --> 36:24.000
And on the Sony PSP, Dragon Ball Z Shin Burukai 2 is coming out.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
And probably the game most of you really, really care about above all this other stuff I've mentioned,

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
Final Fantasy II, the Anniversary Edition, comes out in Japan.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000
Which I have to say, I was horribly mistaken when selling stuff like that to my customers

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
because I thought it was just a port.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
It looks pretty sexy, actually.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
Oh, the new Final Fantasy games? Oh my god, they look hot.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
No, they're definitely not a port.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
They've redone it for the widescreen and all the graphics and everything.

36:49.000 --> 36:56.000
They're not even ports of the ones that were on the Advance which were based off the Wonderswan ones.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
They've upgraded it beyond that.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Again, this would be their third upgrade.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Looks nice. At least they're upgrading it.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Take note, SNK.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Alright, so that's going to do it for release dates.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
Well, there's actually some really cool news for people who are fans of Second Life.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
Is that this upcoming...

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
Actually, I think that it's already passed given the date of...

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Yeah, it was on June 1st at 7pm.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
But BBC2 was broadcasting on Second Life.

37:32.000 --> 37:38.000
They were doing The Money Program, which is a business show

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
that shows how big business affects everyday life.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
Apparently, this looks like it might become a standard thing, I hope.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Did somebody throw cocks at them?

37:53.000 --> 38:01.000
Well, for anyone in Second Life, the only place that you could go to watch it was the Red Run Red Cinema in Second Life.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I think it's kind of cool.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
I totally have never played Second Life. This stuff is all foreign to me.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
I tried once and thought it was crap, so I stopped playing.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
All I ever could think about was Second Life with the flying penises.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I saw that one YouTube video.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
I have real life. I have a first life.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
It would be fun just to roam around Second Life and do stuff to annoy people.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
Although the cool thing is that someone actually built the inside of the TARDIS

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
and built Daleks and all that. I thought it was cool.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Nerds, all of you.

38:32.000 --> 38:40.000
I would want to make a giant stickman that's 500 stories tall that stomps around and smashes everything.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
I know. Can we have monsters in Second Life? Can I make Godzilla?

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
Well, people made weapons of mass destruction and blown stuff up, so...

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
That's lovely.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
So why not?

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
Giant Mario. Have him get the starter thing, turn in the pixelated Mario. Smash, smash, smash.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
People will find humor in that, I would think.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
I saw a really funny picture speaking of Mario Smash.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
It was someone's signature on our forums, on the Dark Sakura forums,

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
because that's where our World of Warcraft guild has their forums headquartered.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Willplay.darksacra.com

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
There you have it.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Somebody made this little graphic or found it somewhere.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
You remember in Super Mario Bros. 3, Mario could get the Hammer Brothers costume?

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
You see him throw a hammer into this hole. It goes boop.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Then you see the hammer fly in the hole.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
It zooms out and it's the Death Star.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And it just flips upside down and says a million points.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
And it falls down like the monsters used to do.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
They just would flip upside down.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
I'll have to find that picture and link it in chat while we do our next story.

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
Anyways, if you want some other awesome news,

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
you may want to try this brand new beta that's come out for a new MMO.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
It's going to be a game called Fury, and it's a third-person slasher game, I guess.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
Or a third-person combat game that you're going to be running around

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
as knights or whatever and killing each other.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
So who wouldn't like that?

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
But they're having a beta for it right now,

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
so if you're very interested in this, check out the Fury beta sign-up page

40:14.000 --> 40:19.000
at www.unleashthefury.com

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and slash beta.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And you can check out that.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Looks pretty neat.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
There's some other game out there.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
I can't remember the name of it, but it was a Korean MMO

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
that compared it to The Matrix.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
A lot of running on walls in gunfights and stuff like that.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
But this looks kind of neat.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Love the title.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
That's so great.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Oh, you saw the picture?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
I was just watching it because Junami linked it.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Yeah, I didn't even see a Junami beat me to it.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
You bastard!

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Good job, though.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Chat room.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Meanwhile, I'm looking it up.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
But I got distracted by a post because somebody was spamming the forums,

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
again, advertising Viagra, and I was really curious.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
No, I'm kidding.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Nobody reads those posts on any forum.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I don't understand.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
You're just now seeing the low-key Tingle graphic?

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
One of our listeners did that last week and put it on my All Games blog.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Anyway, sorry.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
This is not good radio.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Fail.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
What is good, though, is a Gods and Heroes Rome Rising beta.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
The beta test sign-ups are going on right now.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Perpetual Entertainment opened up the sign-ups.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
It's going to be a closed beta, though, so you have to be lucky and get picked.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.000
But it's for Gods and Heroes Rome Rising.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
The sign-up started, it looks like, on May 31st, and I don't see a closed date.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
Of course, this is going to be an MMO from Perpetual Entertainment,

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
and you get to be the son or daughter of an Olympus god.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
So you get to conquer enemies of Rome, you get to battle the iconic enemies

41:52.000 --> 41:57.000
such as the Cyclops, Minotaur, Hydra, so on, Medusa, etc.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
So check that out.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
If you're into MMOs and you like Greek mythology, it would be a good time.

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
The graphics from the game look very pretty.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
Sometimes screenshots don't show you that the game is very fluid,

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
so I'm hoping it runs as good as it looks.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
It might be fun.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
What's also fun is DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
and left and right every week

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
and find her favorite website to share with you guys.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
We're going to share that with you guys right now.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
It's the Website of the Week.

42:35.000 --> 42:41.000
Today's Website of the Week actually is brought to me by my amazing sauce

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
who is wonderful and full of internet nerdness and greatness.

42:45.000 --> 42:50.000
It's lolbots.com, and this basically takes Caturday

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
and just macros every freaking nerdy thing ever in existence.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
I'll have you know that my wife looked at this and she didn't get it,

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
as did I. I didn't get it.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
I LOLed a couple times.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
You do not have the geek vibe in you, obviously.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
I do. I understand why it's supposed to be funny.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
I just don't care anymore.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
It's just like, it's old.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
Give it up. Okay, yeah, we get it. Okay.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
There's been games that have been translated literally from their Japanese stuff,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
and it was funny because it was English.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Ooh, funny! Ha ha!

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
You know, get over it! That was years ago! Come on!

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
You know, literacy is not a jokey matter.

43:31.000 --> 43:37.000
I don't even know where the hell to go after that.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Prozac. You should get some.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Valium, maybe.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
lolbots.com. Valium.com for Loki.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Maybe you need to be reading some of those forum posts

43:51.000 --> 43:57.000
that advertise the, you know, anti-depressants from the interwebs.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
Remember, if you have trouble keeping it up, read the Viagra spam.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
Well, doing our weekly part in promoting GameTap, or not...

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Swear to God we're not on their payroll, I swear!

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Yeah, we are. We're not getting paid.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
They fixed the glitch in accounting.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
Anyways, they're doing, on top of their normal subscription service,

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
they're doing a free kind of ad-supported service that's coming out.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
They're going to be rotating 30 games every so often.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
And starting off, you're going to get to play for free

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
Panzer Dragon, Metal Slug 2, Art of Fighting, The King of Fighters 95,

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
and the upcoming Tomb Raider Legend.

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
You know, kind of tying in with the whole Tomb Raider Anniversary stuff.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Also, they were saying that there's Bust to Move, Bubble Bobble, and Rampage

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
and all sorts of stuff like that.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
So, that's kind of neat.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
I mean, free games. Who can knock that?

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
But they're ad-supported, so they're not totally free.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
You're paying for them with your soul.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Hey, I get free games.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
Hey, well it beats fucking playing like, you know, an EA game,

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
say like Need for Speed or something, having advertisements in the background.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I already bought that game. Where's my money?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Well, you know what?

45:18.000 --> 45:24.000
All these games are old, and a lot of people probably already have them.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
I mean, it is the internet. There are ways to get stuff free.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Did GameTap open that up for those folks that are playing those?

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Can they still play them online?

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
Do they have access to the head-to-head service on there?

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Yeah. I think some of them will have online co-op.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
That's kind of cool.

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
So maybe now I can play with some of the cheapskates and won't pay for GameTap.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
I can play some games with them online.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
Rob, I will pay so we can play real Metal Slug.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Or you could just come to my house.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Or you could just wait until, I don't know,

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
Metal Slug eventually comes to Xbox Live Arcade because, you know,

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
SNK loves re-releasing that damn game.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
Ravenstahl often confirms it does have online multiplayer. Interesting.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
All right. Well, there you have it.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Also, I wanted to mention briefly,

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
I saw in some interview somewhere that GameTap is still being worked on for the Mac.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
And it could be coming out very soon.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
I don't know if they had a date on that.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Which makes Loki very happy.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
But no, I'll make many Mac fans out there very happy.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
I think that would be very cool.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
I was going to say, why would it make me happy? I don't own a Mac.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
It's a joke. That's what we call in the industry a joke.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Oh, because the Mac will have the ability to play old-ass games?

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
Well, I'm curious if the PC games are going to play on the Mac.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
That's kind of interesting, these games that were developed for the PC.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
I don't see why they wouldn't.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Yeah, it's just interesting to me.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
It's kind of like when you see Sega making games for a Nintendo system.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
It's still kind of weird.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Same thing.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
The first Sega games that I played, Rob, were on the ColecoVision.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
I love the ColecoVision.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
I'm so sad that I sold my ColecoVision to get a Super Nintendo.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
I have another one if you want one.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I had 70 games at one time.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
I used to go to flea markets and buy that shit for a buck each.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
If I can find my second one, would you like it?

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
No, because that time is long past.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
I was thinking about hooking up the Atari 5200 the other day, just for kicks.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
All right.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
Well, just for kicks, gold farmers like to annoy the shit out of me in World of Warcraft.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Seriously, I know not all our listeners play World of Warcraft,

47:27.000 --> 47:32.000
but if you've been playing in the past month, huge problems with spammers on there.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
Gold farmers just going crazy in the game, sending tells.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
Well, the cool thing is that with the latest patch, Blizzard really put the smackdown on it.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
What they did is that now you can just right-click on a name and report them for spam automatically.

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
If you have a trial account, you can't send a tell to somebody unless they're on your friends list

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
or they sent you a tell first.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Because that's what was happening is that they were getting all these trial accounts,

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
the gold spammers, and just spamming the hell out of everybody.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
Blizzard did put the smackdown on them and got pretty pissed.

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
In fact, they went a step further and said this.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Blizzard has filed a federal lawsuit against the operators of Peons for Hire,

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
which is a popular gold-selling organization which many of you have no doubt seen advertised

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
because they were the ones that were really spamming in the game.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
As part of the lawsuit, the operators of Peons for Hire have been asked to immediately cease all in-game spamming efforts

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
by all entities and websites under their control.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
So Blizzard is now putting the smackdown in court.

48:28.000 --> 48:35.000
By the way, it hasn't stopped because now what they do, they'll send you party invites and then send you the spam.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
So I automatically decline party invites. I'm not expecting.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
Why do you think I don't party with anybody but who I know?

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Well, yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying.

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
But it's annoying because when you get a party invite, it goes boom and the little thing pops up on the screen.

48:48.000 --> 48:57.000
Like the TGFRCVHGI has invited you to a party, which is just some spammer who hit their keyboard.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
It's just annoying because you're trying to kill somebody and then boom.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
Yes, and Blizzard has partnered up with Capcom to get Phoenix Wright on the case.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
He'll get those spammers.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
I hope so. He'll get them.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
Phoenix Wright 5 versus the gold spammers.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
All right.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
You can see it now.

49:15.000 --> 49:24.000
Anyway, well, if anybody is interested, because you know Activision is just, well, we hear things now and again.

49:24.000 --> 49:33.000
But according to their financial report, they're stating that enemy territory quake wars will be out by the end of summer.

49:33.000 --> 49:39.000
It actually was on paper to be due during the second quarter of the fiscal 2008.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
So I don't know.

49:43.000 --> 49:49.000
However, all they're saying is that it's still just going to be done when it's done.

49:49.000 --> 49:53.000
Hmm. Let me consult my magic eight ball here.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Hmm. Signs point to end of August.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
That's what everybody else is saying.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Oh, your magic eight ball, huh?

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Invisible eight ball.

50:03.000 --> 50:09.000
The eight ball we don't speak about ever, especially when Namco's in the room.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
La la la.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
It's eight ball, not a katamari.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Oh, I see.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Rob.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
What?

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Rob.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
What?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Rob.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
What?

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Tell us some other stuff.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Well, excuse me.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Dark Sakura.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Oh, my God, you didn't do it right.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Okay.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
I don't want Rob to say anything else.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Rob's not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Thank you, Rob D. I heart you.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Rob is not allowed to talk for the rest of the show.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.000
Loki, you're taking over as our mediator here.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Lord help us.

50:42.000 --> 50:48.000
Whoa.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
I'm going to throw something.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Where's the ferret?

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Is that Kirby?

50:52.000 --> 50:53.000
No, it's a Jigglypuff.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Let me see Jigglypuff.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
I'll throw it at Rob.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
I can't reach Jigglypuff.

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
The best part is he sent me two.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Well, excuse me again.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
Dark Sakura.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
I hit Rob in the shoulder with a Jigglypuff.

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
We have the best fucking listeners of any radio program on anywhere.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
No, you don't.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
You suck.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Go to hell.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Anyways.

51:18.000 --> 51:21.000
So, surprise.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Final Fantasy XIII is hit.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
Well, probably not the first, but one of the many delays, this being Final Fantasy XIII

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Versus, has been put on hold.

51:31.000 --> 51:39.000
According to an interview with Dengeki PlayStation of Japan, Final Fantasy main man Tetsuya Nomura

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
has revealed that he likes to only work on one project at a time.

51:43.000 --> 51:50.000
And, obviously, right now, his focus is a mobile game called Monotone, and that means

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
that Final Fantasy XIII is on hold.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
But, you know, not a big surprise, also, I mean, because it's not just a port of XIII,

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
it is an entirely new game itself.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
So, yeah, you'll just have to deal with one Final Fantasy XIII game.

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
And, my God, release only one Final Fantasy game at a time.

52:12.000 --> 52:20.000
Don't make XIII-1, XIII-2, XIII-B, XIII-I mean, you got a little happy with VII because

52:20.000 --> 52:26.000
VII was so popular and it sold well, then you started doing this shit with XII.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Fucking money hungry bitches.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
Just make one game only.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
And then, if people like the game, they'll say, hey, I want more.

52:34.000 --> 52:41.000
Instead of saying, hey, we have 13 games coming out for Final Fantasy XIII, collect them all.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
Final Fantasy XIII.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
Fabulous Kristin Novellas.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Kristin Novellas.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
You know what that sounds like at one of those Telemundo shows or whatever?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Kristin Novellas.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Telemundo, Telemundo.

53:01.000 --> 53:10.000
Tonight on Sabado Higante, Fabulous Kristin Novella.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
Seems like none of this other news even matters anymore.

53:14.000 --> 53:21.000
However, Electronic Arts out of Canada recently lifted the embargo going on for the upcoming

53:21.000 --> 53:30.000
PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 racer, Need for Speed Pro Street.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
It is a new game coming out a little later this year.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
It's not quite the same underground street racing you're used to with the Need for Speed.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It's something a little bit new.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
Now you're going to go to Raceways and show your muscle there.

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
Basically, you race in a little bit of a different way than you have in the underground ones before.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
It's race wars.

53:50.000 --> 53:59.000
Real cars, including the Mazda RX-7, the Aston Martin DB9, Audi S4, Dodge Challenger from 71.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Good times.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
And, of course, some screenshots were released as well.

54:03.000 --> 54:07.000
Some of the new modes in the game, Tandem Drift, Drag Grip, and Speed Challenge.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
It's coming out in fall of 2007.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
You can totally see in one of these screenshots here a drag race kind of mode.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Pretty cool.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
You know what I really would love to see EA make?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
What's that?

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
A Cannonball Run game.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
They've got the graphics.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
They've got the engine.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Let's get Burt Reynolds on this thing.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Good times.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
So, we're going to get into the mailbag, but...

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
What?

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
I have to play this.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
No!

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
Give me Julie Puff again.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
No, no, no.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
It's nothing to do with you, DarkSakura, but it's something else that was brought up earlier in the show.

54:41.000 --> 54:46.000
Ready?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
That's right.

54:47.000 --> 54:53.000
It's the soundtrack to Miss World, Nude 96.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Come on.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
All right.

54:58.000 --> 55:03.000
Keep it up.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
This makes for great radio, doesn't it?

55:05.000 --> 55:14.000
But this is the soundtrack I'm going to look forward to.

55:14.000 --> 55:17.000
Dude, this is great.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I remember.

55:19.000 --> 55:31.000
It just looped that same thing over and over again.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Now I'm ready for the mailbag.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
DarkSakura reads them.

55:39.000 --> 55:46.000
Here she goes.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Hey, Rob.

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Yes?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Die in a plague.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
Well, excuse me, DarkSakura.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
Whatever.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
Turn off the damn music.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Oh, my God.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
You're trying to...

56:04.000 --> 56:11.000
You know, I was just over my PMS and you made it worse.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
I single-handedly brought it back.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
All right, read an email.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
We got one from VoteForDan, I guess.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
I'm not voting for him.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Oh, Dr. Burst, I'm sorry.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
Do you think WoW will come to the Xbox 360?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Did I answer this one already?

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Yeah, didn't we do that one last week?

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Sorry, I already answered this last week.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Download the old podcast.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
I don't think it will anyways.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Next email.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Hi, everyone at OLR.

56:37.000 --> 56:43.000
I just wanted to write a quick email to let you know that I listen to your podcasts every time a new one comes out

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
and I have access to download it to my MP3 player.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
I listen to all your podcasts multiple times while I'm working.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Each opinion from the OLR staff is extremely appreciated.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
I am a member on GameTrailers.com with the username NarutoCastle.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
I will be giving OLR a plug on my blog when I get a spare moment to write one on there.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
We'll let you know when it's up.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I've been playing Final Fantasy III and enjoying it a lot.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
Cannot wait for Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy V to come out on Nintendo DS.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Well, thanks for reading my email.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
Take care, Gregory in Australia.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Thank you for the plug in your blog because that's like word-of-mouth advertising, which is so essential for us.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
Well, speaking of which, he also writes back and says,

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
Hi guys, Greg here again updating on my blog that lets GameTrailer members know about OLR.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Feel free to take a look at the blog.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
Go to GameTrailers.com and search for user NarutoCastle and you'll see blogs.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
The most recent should be the OLR blog.

57:36.000 --> 57:41.000
I was doing my best to spread the word to as many people as I can who either listen to podcasts or into video games.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
Thank you so much for a great podcast and keep up the great work.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Aw, thank you.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
Wasn't there a question there amongst all the lovey-dovey stuff?

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I don't know.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
Oh, I thought there was a question at the beginning of his first email.

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
Well, we have another one from Xenoore, I guess how it's spelled, X-E-N-O-O-R-E.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Hey guys, love the show.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I've been listening for a few episodes here and there.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
Your group dynamic always brings smiles to my cheeks.

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
It reminds me of my squad of geek gamers from times long past.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Keep up the awesome work.

58:13.000 --> 58:19.000
Recently, during some banter amongst the group, you commented on the combat system of Final Fantasy XII.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Your discussion intrigued me enough to give the game a shot.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
Hubsqueenix sends you a big check for your promotion skills.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
Best to look to you guys in the future as Xenoore.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
I haven't heard that expression before, bring a smile to my cheeks.

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
I just hope you're not talking about your ass cheeks, because that's not a compliment.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
You can't smile on your ass, dammit.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
What the hell is wrong with you?

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
It's sideways.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
Forget it.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Well, we have another-

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
That doesn't make any sense.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
It totally doesn't.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Most of my jokes don't.

58:48.000 --> 58:56.000
I'm going to actually download the image so that I can put it on my PhotoCrapIt account and show everybody in the chat room.

58:56.000 --> 59:01.000
But we got one from RobWithTwoBees.

59:01.000 --> 59:07.000
This attaches a couple hours of work on how to decorate my first Forza 2 car.

59:07.000 --> 59:13.000
It's mostly based on the pixel motif of the homepage, and he did an OL Army Audi.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Can we see the picture in studio again?

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
It's very pretty.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
That's an awesome car.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
I'm very impressed.

59:19.000 --> 59:23.000
Rob Way gets 50 points for Gryffindor.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
I don't know.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
What can we give the listeners to do cool stuff like this?

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
I don't know.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Mad props, I suppose.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
But that's not-

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
A dollar.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
The cars that people have been-

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
That's right.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Rob, if you send us-

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Okay, here you go.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Yes, we will do that.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Rob, if you will send us your PayPal, assuming-

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
I don't know if it's your regular email, if you have a silver email.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.000
I'll PayPal you $1, courtesy of Orange Launch Radio for your awesomeness for this car.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
You should frame it, too.

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
Also coming from Rob's favorite person, SakuraMaxx.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
Oh, yeah, this guy.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
How old is he?

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Eleven?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Twelve.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
Oh, big difference.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Quick email to say happy birthday.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Jamie rules.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Loki is cool.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Sky sucks.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It had lots of dots after it.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But the Bimani music is cool.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I'm so sad because some 12-year-old on the internet hates me.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Boo hoo, what am I going to do?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I think it's kind of funny.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I asked for dark Sakura hate mail, not Sky hate mail.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Why don't you people listening-

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Signed, SakuraMaxx, 12-year-old listener, one with the best email closings once a pet

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
grew and loves Pokey.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Why do you even read his emails?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
They bring nothing to the show.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Because they're funny.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
They bring nothing to the show.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Why is it so awful?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
They're funny.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I'm supposed to get this game later this week, Forza 2, by the way.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I have no interest in Forza 2 whatsoever.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I don't either, but-

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Hey, last email.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Microsoft hooks me up sometimes.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Hey, OLR crew, it's GS68.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I enjoyed the OLR panel at Fanime and I'm looking forward to seeing it again next year.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
How is Fanime anyhow?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Any good stories to share?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
That was from GS68.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Yeah, there was me deciding that my costume wasn't going to work and going in the dealer's

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:02.000
room and dropping $120 to buy the stuff for my Iruka costume and I ended up doing chick

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
style.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Can I have a loan?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Shit.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I don't know.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I bought a-

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I got yelled at by my husband.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It was great.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Over breakfast.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I'm sorry.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I bought a bit generation game called Colorist and I have no idea how to play it.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
You got a porn star's autograph too, didn't you?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I got a porn star's autograph for my wife and she loved that.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I also got two Harry Potter pictures for my wife.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
She liked that as well.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
There's one other thing I thought I got her as well.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I can't remember.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I bought one shirt.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
That's the only thing I bought.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I got him the Goomba that makes noise.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Oh, that thing was cool.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
The thing you hit and it goes oink oink oink.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And then you hit it one more time and it does the You're Dead music.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I went back looking for the coin box and they didn't have it.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You keep hitting the coin box and every tenth one it gives you a one up.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
This isn't intended as a plug but you can order them from Wizzy Wig.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Oh, alright.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
That's where I got my Goomba from.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I also got a shirt that said Grand Theft Amish, Penn State Dutch.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Yeah, from the same booth that he got that shirt, I got one.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I actually posted a picture of the shirt in my All Games blog.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
If you want to see that, it's community.allgames.com.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
How the hell do you get there?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Green Sky is my username on there.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Just find me on there.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I posted a picture of the shirt I got.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It says, this is Zelda.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Basically, they took a picture of the guy from 300.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
They took a picture of his face and put the Zelda hat on him.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It's really funny if you see it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
That's great. I've seen that one, yeah.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I didn't even see 300 and I get the joke so I thought it was great.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
How was that? That was the shirt I got.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Oh, I didn't mention during my gaming week, though,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
since he asked about how was the rest of Fonimate.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Because I got there right before our panel started,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I didn't get to spend much time there.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
But I went to the game room afterwards.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I went the day after.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And I played some Papa music on a Melo 2.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And I got the high score on the machine.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I forgot how to get high speed.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And my dumbass picked the Galaxy Express 3.9 TV theme.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Which is fucking slow.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I don't think you can put high speed on that one.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
At least I don't know how.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I couldn't figure it out either.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Because I was like, dude, I can play Papa music better than this.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
I did, however, play a crap ton of Dance Maniacs.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And we had Para Para Shadowing going on.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Oh my god, nerds.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
With people who could do it. It was good.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Wow.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
All right, so there you go.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Yeah, we'll be back.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
If they'll have us, we'll be back next year.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And the best part was hanging out with DJ Ronma S.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
The best part was the mini-disc player recorded the show this time.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
That's right.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Sort of.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
The show didn't come out too bad.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It did weird shit, and I don't know why.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Probably has something to do with the fact that the battery is slowly eating itself away.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Oh, and the other great part, we found out that Loki's Mac Heckler lives in town.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
So we're going to have him on a future show.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I found something cool, too.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And I'm going to, actually, next week's side of the week is probably going to be a plug for this guy's site.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I hung out a lot in Artist Alley.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Because me being an artist and having a bunch of my friends in there,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I had to go and hang out with the artsy fartsy people.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And it turned out that I got more photos taken of me wearing my Tron shirt with my Dolphie than in costume.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Which was sort of sad.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000
But I also bought this great print of Iron Man for Sauce.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And this guy drew me Deadpool, and he said that he'd do a full-color print for me.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
And he actually lives in the Sacramento area.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So I'm going to plug his site next week.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Oh, I know which guy you're talking about.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
The guy that does all the comic stuff and he's at every single anime convention.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I think he's even at the Sacramento one sometime.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I think he was supposed to be here, yeah.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I was going to give him a call about the commission for the picture because he did a really freaking good job.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
There's a SAC anime convention coming up this weekend.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I can't go because I'm in New York.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
It's not this weekend, is it?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Yeah, I think it's coming up this next weekend.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Well, next weekend, yeah.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Well, I'll go to the mall anyways.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
No, I think it's the one at the temple.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Anyway, forget it.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
We'll talk about it offline.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
But hey, if you run an anime convention, you want us to come do a live panel, we're open to suggestions.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Dude, sweet, the Rob D.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
We're kind of broke and can't travel too much, but we're certainly open to hearing suggestions,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
especially anything that goes on in Northern California or Southern California or Northern Nevada, someplace we can drive to.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
No, to the Rob D, they said that they did an anime hell at Asen.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I didn't know that they put the full Sega Tashanshiro video in that, which is like, anyone who's a Sega fan has to have seen that.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Hmm.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
It's like the epitome of the Sega Saturn advertising era.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
All right, we're going to get back into some news though.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Enough talk about conventions.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Where shall we go for another story?

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Let's go to me.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Let's talk about the PSP.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Sony releases its uncrackable firmware 3.5.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It adds a bunch of new features, including remote play, so you have the ability to play anything that's on your PS3,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
well, movies and whatnot over the internet on your PSP.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Also, let's see here, yeah, also it enhances some of the RSS feeds and stuff like that.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Interesting.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:30.000
One other feature that they forgot to mention, it is actually very crackable and got cracked almost, actually I think a day before it came out, if that's possible.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:43.000
But yeah, so now they're working on a new custom firmware for 3.5 and it was kind of funny because they actually used the tools from 3.3 to crack it and apparently it wasn't that hard.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So, way to go Sony.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Was that their unhackable firmware?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Yeah, their unhackable firmware.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Each firmware is unhackable, you understand.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Well, of course.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Of course.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Can't do it, just can't.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
It's impossible.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Sad.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Oh, speaking of unhacking PSPs, it was very interesting.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I fixed, I've been taking apart PSPs to fix them.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000
My friend's analog stick was broken and I actually took apart the entire analog stick and fixed it.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Which is amazing because anybody knows me, normally when I take stuff apart it works less than when I first took it apart.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
So, yeah, I'm not very good at that.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
But PSP, it's magic.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Well, speaking of hacking...

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Is it your mutant power?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I guess it is my mutant power to be able to fix PSPs.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Speaking of hacking things and changing them and making them your own of sorts, this was a very interesting statement made by Activision in a conference call they had with investors this week.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
This is something else.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Now, keep in mind, Activision acquired the Guitar Hero franchise when they bought out Red Octane, essentially, or their acquisition of Red Octane, whatever you want to call it.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
They got the Guitar Hero franchise.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
What's interesting is they have now said about Rock Band, which is coming out,

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It wasn't surprising that Guitar Hero has attracted imitators.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Okay, so basically you're saying Rock Band is an imitation of Guitar Hero, except you may remember Harmonix originally made Guitar Hero for Red Octane before you bought it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000
So that comment made no sense at all.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And when you consider Guitar Freaks came first anyway, by Konami, you all suck.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Just make your games, make them good, and SDF you?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And technically they're all rip-off of Amplitude anyways, Amplitude and Frequency.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Well, the interface of Guitar Hero, that and Karaoke Revolution, too, a little bit.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Yeah, they really pay that guy the big bucks, apparently. He's real on top of everything.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Have you seen the gameplay footage of Guitar Hero 3 that's on the internet right now?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It looks pretty sexy, but it doesn't look that different.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Yeah, I think this is the game that'll finally jump the shark for everybody else.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I think the series jumped the shark already for me with this 80's edition thing, but I think Guitar Hero 3 people are finally going to go, okay, enough.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:17.000
But I think that's good that Harmonix, instead of trying to do the same thing over again, is trying to...

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I give them a lot of credit. They're a pretty badass company in many ways.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
And I think the fact that they are trying to evolve with the marketplace, with this whole rock band thing, it's a huge risk.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
But then again, so is Guitar Hero.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm sorry, but I think Activision is going to get left behind with the Guitar Hero franchise.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:41.000
It's going to be kind of like Guitar Freaks was. Look at Guitar Freaks.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
How many versions of that game have come out and really they haven't innovated on each other?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Yet for some reason they're still doing well in Japan, so that's kind of funky.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
So you can either have one or two things.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Either it's going to still do very well, or it's just going to tank.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I think people are going to start figuring out, hey, maybe spending all this money on this guitar game each time around is not a good idea.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It's kind of like why DDR is starting to dip down a little bit in popularity, especially when it's coming out on all these new platforms.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Buy all new hardware for this shit.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Actually, we haven't heard a lot about what's going on in the DDR world in a while.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I guess maybe by the time E3 or whatever the hell it is.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Honestly though, come on. Think of all the things that we probably would have expected with the 360 version.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Really, the 360 version is just a prettied up version of the Xbox One.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And the one for the Nintendo Wii when it comes out is pretty much just a PlayStation 2 version of Supernova with Wiimote crap thrown on there.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I was going to say, I guess we have Wii DDR. That's kind of something we know so far.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Very, I don't know, very non-innovative.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Granted, yeah, great you're doing stuff with the Wiimote, but I don't think you really need to do stuff with the Wiimote.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It's just like the iToy.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Yeah, the iToy support was there. It was ridiculous.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Not even remotely fun. It made you look like a complete ass.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I don't know.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Anyway, sorry, we've definitely beat this story into the ground, but just a dumb comment made by that guy at Activision.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Just a dumb comment.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
When have we heard much smart from that guy at Activision? I swear, doesn't he hang out with Kudaragi?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Don't know. Maybe they all have a secret bar they drink at all day.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
You mean crayon juice?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Anyway, something that's pretty cool, at least if you're into it, is that SNK Playmore is to be releasing...

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
A new game?

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Sort of.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
They're doing Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1, which is Fatal Fury, Fatal Fury 2, Fatal Fury 3, and Fatal Fury Special.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Aw, so close!

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But hey, we get old school my booty.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Are you going to be redoing any of the graphics whatsoever?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
No.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Okay.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Would that be arcade quality?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Whoopee!

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Didn't those games come out ten years ago?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Seriously, Fatal Fury Special came out in 1995.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000
To give them credit, their Art of Fighting collection was only $14.99 for the Playstation 2.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You know the one thing I liked about the Fatal Fury games that I thought was innovative for old 2D fighters was having the multiplane.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
You couldn't really tell which plane they were on, but you had the front and back.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Oh, I love Fatal Fury, don't get me wrong.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
It was my favorite, like, obviously Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat were kind of up on this path.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Actually, Street Fighter was up on a frickin' pedestal.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Mortal Kombat was close behind, and then you had all these other knockoff fighting games below, right?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
In the 90s, right?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I would say Fatal Fury was my favorite of that bunch.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
More so than anything else SNK put out.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Fatal Fury paved the way for King of Fighters, and that makes me happy.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
No, here's what SNK needs to do.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
I mean, great re-releasing games and stuff.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Just re-release Neo Geo collections.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Have Magical Lord, have the Fatal Fury games, Metal Slug, all this stuff together.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Instead of just, here's two games that you've bought before, here's Metal Slug yet again, here's this stuff.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Yeah, but who really bought that stuff?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Those cartridges were like $500.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Exactly. But still, though, they've re-

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
You are a crazy bitch. You're in your own category.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
But still, though, they've re-released these games numerous times.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
To be honest, a lot of them we got through trade.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
The only one that we paid over $300 for was King of Fighters 2000.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Only? I see a $60 Xbox 360 game and I cry.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000
But yeah, but we have a lot more bills now, so we don't do that anymore.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Except I really want Samurai Shodown 5.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Really? It was the last Neo Geo-

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
You will play it once. You will play it once.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
The fuck I will!

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And then put it in a glass case and say, I own it, and you don't.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000
The fuck I will? No. Are we rated M today? Yeah.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Kinda.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Rated M?

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Yeah, we're rated M.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Yeah, ooh, watch out, that ESRB's on our ass.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
We're rated I for-

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Wait, we're not a game, dumbass. You can't play through us.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
We're rated I for immature. Thanks to Loki.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Something's telling me we need a little bit of a break.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
No.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I think now's a good time. We're gonna break you.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Break you back.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I will break you.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I will break you.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this break.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000
