WEBVTT

00:13.927 --> 00:19.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, June 24th, 2007, our introduction takes a little trip down memory lane.

00:20.849 --> 00:22.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, where are we going?

00:30.511 --> 00:35.892
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

00:59.213 --> 01:25.747
[SPEAKER_04]: and now for our feature presentation Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content so you probably shouldn't let your children listen

01:26.901 --> 01:35.124
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!

01:36.544 --> 01:40.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

01:44.906 --> 01:49.668
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

01:49.928 --> 01:52.549
[SPEAKER_05]: Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, sir.

01:52.969 --> 01:56.470
[SPEAKER_05]: He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

01:57.381 --> 02:00.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

02:00.564 --> 02:01.365
[SPEAKER_05]: Sandburgers!

02:02.105 --> 02:04.247
[SPEAKER_05]: The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.248
[SPEAKER_05]: That was huge.

02:06.810 --> 02:07.430
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

02:07.770 --> 02:10.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

02:11.814 --> 02:13.616
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

02:13.656 --> 02:15.537
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing you're gonna be riding is me.

02:15.998 --> 02:17.779
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen my... Lena?

02:18.160 --> 02:21.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

02:22.023 --> 02:22.764
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was you.

02:23.721 --> 02:25.883
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Sky, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio,

02:46.588 --> 02:51.849
[SPEAKER_06]: We are live on this June the 24th of 2007.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Good God, that was a bloated ass intro.

02:55.130 --> 02:58.351
[SPEAKER_06]: That was actually... That was one of our old intros.

02:58.391 --> 03:00.212
[SPEAKER_06]: That intro was like two minutes long.

03:00.752 --> 03:01.392
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

03:02.912 --> 03:04.613
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually used that for like a year.

03:05.153 --> 03:09.774
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, hi and welcome to that show dedicated not just to Bomani now, but after...

03:10.365 --> 03:16.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Several years on the air, we evolved to talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.

03:16.068 --> 03:17.129
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

03:17.529 --> 03:21.371
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

03:21.851 --> 03:22.172
Hi.

03:25.493 --> 03:27.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Five years, and that's all you have to say is, ah.

03:28.235 --> 03:28.595
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

03:28.635 --> 03:30.016
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I'd sum it up, too, really.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.762
[SPEAKER_06]: and also say hello as always to Tech Master Loki.

03:33.902 --> 03:34.182
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

03:34.742 --> 03:35.403
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Loki?

03:35.863 --> 03:36.683
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.

03:36.964 --> 03:37.264
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:37.324 --> 03:37.824
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

03:38.204 --> 03:39.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you have it.

03:39.245 --> 03:42.107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the three of us tonight because tonight is a special night.

03:42.167 --> 03:43.728
[SPEAKER_06]: It is our fifth anniversary show.

03:44.228 --> 03:52.754
[SPEAKER_06]: And hello to those of you in our chat room, the always present fourth guest in our program, chat.orangeloungerator.com, the biggest our chat room has ever been.

03:52.794 --> 03:53.774
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much.

03:54.235 --> 03:59.138
[SPEAKER_06]: And a big thank you to allgames.com as well, who's simulcasting our live broadcast tonight to a

03:59.638 --> 04:00.718
[SPEAKER_06]: I played World of Warcraft.

04:00.738 --> 04:01.038
[SPEAKER_06]: You were there.

04:01.058 --> 04:03.039
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I signed off to go talk to people.

04:24.355 --> 04:25.356
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:45.484 --> 04:50.467
[SPEAKER_07]: and WTF for Work Time Fun, I guess, for the PSP.

04:50.667 --> 04:51.528
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty awesome.

04:51.828 --> 04:52.908
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little weird.

04:53.229 --> 04:54.589
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the games are very mundane.

04:54.609 --> 04:55.530
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like working.

04:55.710 --> 04:58.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Like one of them that you put caps on pens.

04:59.412 --> 05:00.213
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

05:00.653 --> 05:06.716
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another one that's pretty funny, though, where you are a drunken mayor and you have to stumble your way over to a ribbon to cut it.

05:08.397 --> 05:10.518
[SPEAKER_07]: So you basically earn money to...

05:12.606 --> 05:13.806
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:32.546 --> 05:36.188
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank God they leaked it on the internet, because I would not have wanted to buy this game.

05:36.528 --> 05:38.548
[SPEAKER_07]: It is horrible.

05:39.109 --> 05:40.329
[SPEAKER_07]: It's short, for one.

05:40.809 --> 05:44.751
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I beat the game under an hour, so that's pretty bad.

05:45.551 --> 05:54.715
[SPEAKER_07]: The second thing is, the guy behind it, this French guy who does this podcast, I believe it's called, was it Street Smart Cool Cat?

05:55.715 --> 05:56.816
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a fucking retard.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.478
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate him.

05:58.679 --> 06:00.899
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate him even more after playing this game.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.740
[SPEAKER_07]: He is a complete douche.

06:02.780 --> 06:12.024
[SPEAKER_07]: He is on, like, the beginning of each level that you play, he's doing something stupid to make himself look really cool, and he's not.

06:12.104 --> 06:18.547
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like a cross between fucking Bill Nye the Science Guy and Screech, except not smart and nerdier.

06:19.687 --> 06:23.709
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, I also played, let's see, Transformers, the game on the PSP.

06:24.653 --> 06:26.475
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God I'm not buying the PSP one.

06:27.556 --> 06:29.778
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I will be playing the 360 one later this week.

06:29.978 --> 06:33.361
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to see what the PSP one looked like, and it's not very good.

06:34.082 --> 06:37.485
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you only have a PSP, then maybe it's worth picking up.

06:38.528 --> 07:01.754
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, I actually played some of the single player part of that so that was kind of interesting, pretty good storyline so far of course multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and let's see, off of the PSP, also played Zelda 2, The Adventures of Link still hate that game but I'm still playing it Earth Defense Force 2, I actually tried that on the PlayStation 2

07:04.494 --> 07:05.294
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

07:05.334 --> 07:06.595
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like the controls too much.

07:06.995 --> 07:12.036
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if there's a way to configure it so it's exactly like the Xbox 360, because I think that would really help.

07:12.056 --> 07:19.238
[SPEAKER_07]: Because right now, the way they have it set up, your look and movement are the same analog sticks, so that kind of sucks.

07:19.558 --> 07:20.558
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, it looks pretty cool.

07:20.798 --> 07:22.579
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to destroy Big Ben in the first level.

07:24.952 --> 07:25.853
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, what else?

07:26.113 --> 07:33.841
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I also played, of course, more Earth Defense Force 2017, finished the game on Hard now, and now we're going through Hardest and Inferno.

07:33.861 --> 07:37.624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about time you beat that damn game, because I swear, for like the past ten weeks of this program...

07:44.943 --> 07:45.383
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

08:04.830 --> 08:05.670
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:34.224 --> 08:38.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Our guild is really growing on there, and it's been a lot of fun.

08:38.528 --> 08:42.713
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Ventrilo and all that fun stuff, so it's a fun time waster.

08:43.214 --> 08:45.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, not a whole lot.

08:45.636 --> 08:49.781
[SPEAKER_06]: I checked out the new Xbox Live Arcade titled The Band of Bugs game.

08:49.801 --> 08:50.682
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you check that out at all?

08:51.218 --> 08:52.559
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

09:18.818 --> 09:19.238
[SPEAKER_06]: So much for that.

09:20.139 --> 09:25.104
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I did also, I got on the GameTap for some strange reason.

09:25.144 --> 09:26.325
[SPEAKER_06]: I decided, oh, I'm paying for this.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.807
[SPEAKER_06]: I should probably check it out again.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.929
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just started, I had like a marathon the other day.

09:29.949 --> 09:32.011
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing all these old school Atari 2600 games.

09:32.331 --> 09:34.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was playing Kaboom for like an hour and a half.

09:35.114 --> 09:35.835
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of sad.

09:36.491 --> 09:41.915
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that game, like, you remember on the old school 2600 with the little paddle, except now you use your mouse and you catch the bombs?

09:42.316 --> 09:43.136
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't know what it is.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.358
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, some people can sit there and play Bejeweled for hours.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.259
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing Kaboom.

09:46.699 --> 09:49.001
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I played Pitfall, the old school Pitfall.

09:49.401 --> 09:51.323
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a lot better at it now than I was when I was seven.

09:51.363 --> 09:51.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.631
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually played through quite a ways in the game.

09:55.171 --> 10:00.512
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like how GameTap is really taking a lot of good ideas from Xbox Live and incorporating into their service.

10:00.852 --> 10:04.793
[SPEAKER_06]: Like now you have a profile page that shows the last games that you've played and all that.

10:05.073 --> 10:05.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Where have I seen this before?

10:06.314 --> 10:09.495
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have your leaderboards on the actual service itself.

10:09.735 --> 10:10.935
[SPEAKER_06]: So, pretty cool.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.776
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, hey, if it's a good idea, why not borrow it?

10:15.096 --> 10:17.117
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say rip it off, but I guess it would be borrow it.

10:17.477 --> 10:17.597
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

10:18.437 --> 10:26.959
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like how GameTap's growing and it'll be interesting when it comes over to the Macs and more people that I know have been holding out on GameTap because it's not out on Mac will be able to come over.

10:27.519 --> 10:28.739
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that was really it.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, a little bit of Puzzle Quest and that was pretty much it.

10:31.659 --> 10:33.520
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play a lot of console games this week, funny enough.

10:33.820 --> 10:36.400
[SPEAKER_07]: I got Season 1 of Sam & Max.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.441
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't installed it yet, though, but I'm planning on playing it.

10:40.881 --> 10:43.141
[SPEAKER_07]: My computer's kind of on the fritz right now.

10:43.741 --> 10:46.922
[SPEAKER_07]: Something's going out in it because it randomly shuts off

10:47.492 --> 10:51.775
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm thinking either the power supply, hard drive, or motherboard is going out.

10:51.856 --> 10:53.457
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, I need to upgrade the damn thing.

10:53.937 --> 10:54.758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been like years.

10:56.379 --> 11:03.065
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to the chat room, the always present chat.orangeonestradio.com, always the fourth guest, always has been for the past five years, always will be.

11:03.745 --> 11:05.406
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start out with this lovely comment tonight.

11:05.466 --> 11:09.870
[SPEAKER_06]: RossDLUT in chat says, Sky, God, stop sucking GameTac's cock.

11:11.111 --> 11:11.591
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I...

11:13.064 --> 11:14.485
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd think I'm on their payroll or something.

11:14.525 --> 11:15.265
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God I'm not.

11:15.566 --> 11:18.227
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a pretty good thing.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.648
[SPEAKER_06]: It's relatively cheap.

11:19.688 --> 11:20.688
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a lot of games.

11:20.749 --> 11:21.969
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a bad deal.

11:22.069 --> 11:24.050
[SPEAKER_06]: If I like something, I'm going to tell you I like it.

11:24.110 --> 11:25.591
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about Xbox Live all the time.

11:25.611 --> 11:26.532
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not on their payroll.

11:26.672 --> 11:28.213
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not on anybody's payroll.

11:29.033 --> 11:32.575
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of wish I was getting some nookie from all these people.

11:33.336 --> 11:35.337
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to hire me to rub them while they're naked.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.380
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to give a little massage-lovin' to GameTap?

11:39.680 --> 11:43.962
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I would love to go to the video game companies and be their massage therapist.

11:44.442 --> 11:45.543
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you give out some happy endings?

11:45.583 --> 11:46.744
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you give Reggie a happy ending?

11:47.264 --> 11:47.504
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob?

11:49.205 --> 11:50.766
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's funny in any way.

11:51.186 --> 11:54.768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and Blackboy in the chatroom says, Loki should buy a new MacBook.

11:55.069 --> 12:00.992
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh, that's funny, because see, the next computer I'm buying, my benchmark is it's going to be able to run Crysis very well.

12:01.472 --> 12:05.715
[SPEAKER_07]: So, unfortunately, a MacBook would just, like, explode by...

12:06.755 --> 12:08.993
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, even thinking about running Crysis, so...

12:09.890 --> 12:10.430
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

12:10.511 --> 12:10.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

12:10.991 --> 12:14.333
[SPEAKER_06]: What wasn't so negative that was said in chat here that we could also read?

12:14.593 --> 12:19.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitstun says, I like GameTap so far, but I don't have the disk space or clock speed for any of the newer stuff.

12:20.237 --> 12:20.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

12:20.737 --> 12:27.402
[SPEAKER_06]: I replaced my computer about a year and a half ago, so it's a little bit newer, so it can run some of these more higher-end stuff.

12:27.902 --> 12:32.105
[SPEAKER_06]: And some folks who haven't replaced their computer in a few years are probably struggling a little more.

12:32.305 --> 12:33.566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the process of rebuilding.

12:33.826 --> 12:37.209
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not necessarily rebuilding, but I'm adding in stuff to the one that was given to me.

12:38.109 --> 12:38.410
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

12:38.710 --> 12:39.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

12:39.417 --> 12:40.298
[SPEAKER_06]: I redownloaded MAME today, and...

12:50.930 --> 12:51.631
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Freak's Fifth Mix

13:14.977 --> 13:15.237
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

13:15.357 --> 13:17.478
[SPEAKER_07]: They also have 3rd Korean on there, which I thought was kind of funny.

13:17.658 --> 13:19.639
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually have DDR games playable in MAME?

13:19.679 --> 13:20.159
[SPEAKER_07]: I never knew that.

13:20.259 --> 13:20.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

13:20.439 --> 13:21.020
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of weird.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.021
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're playable well, like audio problems, but I don't know.

13:25.501 --> 13:29.343
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you, have they actually enabled the new Capcom board?

13:29.383 --> 13:31.684
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember last week we reported that like Street Fighter 3 and stuff.

13:31.764 --> 13:32.544
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's now in there?

13:33.145 --> 13:34.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think so.

13:34.545 --> 13:35.746
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember seeing some.

13:37.066 --> 13:37.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

13:37.686 --> 13:41.068
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see the Sega boards emulated.

13:41.748 --> 13:43.469
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I want Planet Harrier.

13:45.140 --> 13:45.881
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:02.560 --> 14:04.501
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, that was our gaming week.

14:04.601 --> 14:08.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get on to some other stuff before we get into the news, like some housekeeping.

14:09.463 --> 14:12.424
[SPEAKER_06]: We just wanted to say tonight, of course, you know, it's our fifth anniversary show.

14:12.804 --> 14:14.445
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a whole lot, you know, I don't know.

14:14.565 --> 14:20.507
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you guys feel, but I wasn't really all about kind of like tooting our own horns tonight.

14:20.828 --> 14:21.708
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is more like...

14:22.128 --> 14:22.528
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.745
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's get on to the gaming news!

15:03.365 --> 15:04.085
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:28.599 --> 15:30.241
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:48.036 --> 15:57.784
[SPEAKER_06]: They should rate it AO in America, and it turns out, oh, the game has been rated AO here in America, adults only, which is a rating that's been reserved for very, very few games.

15:57.984 --> 16:03.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of very under-the-radar type of, like, sex games have gotten this type of rating.

16:03.148 --> 16:04.249
[SPEAKER_07]: All on PC, by the way.

16:04.309 --> 16:05.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're all PC.

16:05.069 --> 16:14.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, because, and then the next part of this was, if the game has continued to stay rated AO, the Nintendo will not endorse it, Sony will not endorse it, and Microsoft will not allow it.

16:14.637 --> 16:14.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is fucked up.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.718
[SPEAKER_07]: They will all not allow the product to come on the systems.

16:16.858 --> 16:17.499
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucked up.

16:18.537 --> 16:22.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the first question I'm going to ask, and maybe somebody's already asked this.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.321
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you know the answer.

16:23.961 --> 16:25.362
[SPEAKER_06]: What about a Renegade release?

16:25.803 --> 16:28.365
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember back in the day, remember on Nintendo?

16:28.825 --> 16:33.428
[SPEAKER_06]: There were companies that would make games without the official Nintendo CO quality, like Color Dreams.

16:33.809 --> 16:39.233
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember those ugly-ass blue cartridges and the really horrible games that came out from them?

16:39.713 --> 16:40.654
[SPEAKER_06]: They could do it.

16:42.034 --> 16:45.076
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking maybe it's because Take-Two is a big, big publisher.

16:45.096 --> 16:46.097
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to burn their bridges.

16:46.177 --> 16:57.264
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not only that, but they could still release everything Renegade or whatever, but I think now that they actually do have to get everything licensed in order to be able to actually press this.

16:57.284 --> 17:02.947
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why everything has to go through certification before it can actually go gold and get disc-pressed on it.

17:03.127 --> 17:05.469
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

17:05.868 --> 17:22.818
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why they... I wish... The whole thing between AO and Mature is retarded anyways, because what you're saying is this game is not suitable for 17-year-olds, which, I don't know, Hustle 2 out there, it's all about torture and people's limbs getting chopped off and rape and stuff.

17:22.838 --> 17:24.099
[SPEAKER_07]: Naked chicks dancing in blood.

17:24.299 --> 17:32.564
[SPEAKER_07]: And naked chicks dancing in blood, and that's suitable for 17-year-olds, but, oh, a pixelated video game, oh, okay, well that's way...

17:33.434 --> 17:37.015
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-year-olds that go, oh, wait, this is teaching me how to commit murder.

17:37.115 --> 17:39.056
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm going to go murder somebody now.

17:39.136 --> 17:39.656
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

17:39.696 --> 17:41.497
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, grow the fuck up.

17:41.957 --> 17:45.118
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're all, well, this is to keep it out of our children's hands.

17:46.439 --> 17:48.120
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not supposed to be in children's hands.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.620
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking 17 and over.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick comments from chat room.

17:52.501 --> 17:53.001
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

17:53.161 --> 17:55.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Corey31 says, but no stores will sell it.

17:55.562 --> 17:56.503
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the main problem.

17:56.723 --> 18:00.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex Silvara follows up, Walmart, Target, Blockbuster wouldn't sell it.

18:00.564 --> 18:00.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

18:00.984 --> 18:02.485
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a selling point for the independents.

18:03.363 --> 18:04.925
[SPEAKER_07]: No, independent stores would carry that shit.

18:04.965 --> 18:09.211
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, when they heard that it was going to be adults only and that Blockbuster, Gamefly...

18:09.941 --> 18:12.683
[SPEAKER_07]: and Walmart weren't going to be carrying it, they're like, I'll double my order.

18:13.163 --> 18:15.465
[SPEAKER_07]: So that shit would still sell.

18:15.665 --> 18:18.247
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not sell as fast, but it would still sell.

18:19.027 --> 18:20.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a comment from Take-Two.

18:21.329 --> 18:25.291
[SPEAKER_06]: This actually comes from, I'm not sure who at Take-Two.

18:25.331 --> 18:26.772
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a general comment from Take-Two.

18:26.852 --> 18:31.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, the ESRB has issued an initial rating of AO, adults only, for Manhunt 2.

18:32.176 --> 18:34.197
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is an actual statement they made.

18:34.717 --> 18:39.780
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe the process of rating video games is to help people make informed entertainment choices and not to limit them.

18:40.120 --> 18:47.523
[SPEAKER_06]: Manhunt 2 is created for mature audiences, and we strongly believe it should receive an M rating, aligning it with similar content created in other forms of media.

18:47.823 --> 18:51.125
[SPEAKER_06]: We are exploring other options with regards to Manhunt 2.

18:51.525 --> 18:54.046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I do think that they're unfairly being targeted.

18:54.606 --> 19:01.950
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always, you know, Take-Two is always the target of, you know, both advocates for, like, you know...

19:03.092 --> 19:03.973
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

19:30.470 --> 19:31.770
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:56.377 --> 19:57.378
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the wrong person to ask.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.180
[SPEAKER_07]: I could have that too.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.481
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't have the Wii mode.

20:13.541 --> 20:16.843
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't actually pretend I am chopping Wiemers off and whatever.

20:16.923 --> 20:20.245
[SPEAKER_02]: I can slice people across their abdomen in Trauma Center and that's rewarding.

20:21.326 --> 20:21.826
[SPEAKER_07]: Good point.

20:21.986 --> 20:23.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's the thing.

20:23.927 --> 20:28.209
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's rated AO for the Wii because you're simulating murder in that.

20:28.730 --> 20:31.091
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is the PlayStation 2 one rated AO as well?

20:31.747 --> 20:32.468
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

20:58.670 --> 21:00.111
[SPEAKER_06]: Afterplay to Black Devil Rx

21:24.218 --> 21:28.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Next can have orifices if you have a tracheotomy or you cut someone's head off.

21:28.599 --> 21:29.379
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the comment?

21:30.960 --> 21:32.880
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a comment about neck rape on there.

21:33.260 --> 21:33.900
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

21:34.240 --> 21:36.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I also want to read another comment from BlackDevilRx.

21:36.801 --> 21:38.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Adults only is a stupid rating.

21:38.561 --> 21:39.541
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no need for it.

21:39.822 --> 21:45.763
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be more like an NC-17 thing because right now they're saying that adults aren't mature, which is the rating below AO, so...

21:46.741 --> 21:47.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

22:06.420 --> 22:07.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

22:24.432 --> 22:27.914
[SPEAKER_06]: and Hostel or Hostel Part 2, which had a lower rating.

22:28.294 --> 22:29.155
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a little sex.

22:29.195 --> 22:32.457
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, that might not be a fair comparison because we're talking about sex versus violence.

22:32.737 --> 22:33.557
[SPEAKER_06]: We're here with Manhunt.

22:33.597 --> 22:34.218
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all violence.

22:34.618 --> 22:41.922
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's just like, you know, with a lot of the ratings on these games and stuff, Grand Theft Auto, there's a perfect example.

22:41.942 --> 22:49.706
[SPEAKER_07]: San Andreas, that game had a bunch of murdering and killing of people and stuff, but oh my God, show a little bit of digital boobie and boom, A-O.

22:50.927 --> 22:52.688
[SPEAKER_07]: See, double fucking standards right there.

22:52.708 --> 22:52.908
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

22:54.105 --> 22:57.267
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just so... I don't even know what the problem is with these people.

22:57.827 --> 23:00.569
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, granted, it is an adult-only game.

23:00.829 --> 23:04.931
[SPEAKER_07]: And mature, I would think, pretty much satisfies that.

23:05.252 --> 23:11.715
[SPEAKER_07]: Because 17 and older, 18 and older, I think between 17 and 18, for the most part, people aren't maturing that much.

23:12.236 --> 23:17.379
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think at 17, you probably know right and wrong about as much as you do when you're 18.

23:17.419 --> 23:19.040
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the level of the...

23:19.810 --> 23:22.854
[SPEAKER_02]: The dividing line of maturity is when you start paying your own bills.

23:23.655 --> 23:25.016
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually a really good point.

23:25.297 --> 23:25.877
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.483
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people in their 20s that live with mommy and daddy that aren't as mature as some people I know that moved out at 17.

23:30.563 --> 23:35.689
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand why they don't just have M as the cap off for that, you know, or...

23:36.624 --> 23:37.565
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

23:55.045 --> 24:23.335
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think to an extent that's what they kind of tried to do with the ESRB is I think they tried to copy the movie ratings without copying them so I think like an M rating is supposed to be like R no one under 17 admitted without parent or guardian and same thing they would sell you a game as long as your mommy or daddy is there with you and the clerk says what's in the game but AO is like NC-17 no one under 17 admitted period parents or not this is just not an acceptable thing

24:23.994 --> 24:26.935
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, and that would be, I think, the thing with the AO rating.

24:26.955 --> 24:29.415
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this game has not sold to anyone over 80.

24:29.736 --> 24:30.536
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like cigarettes.

24:30.616 --> 24:31.876
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not sell it under any circumstance.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like, you know, the M-rated games.

24:34.237 --> 24:37.157
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are not intended to be played by kids that are under 17.

24:38.798 --> 24:43.079
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it is, in a sense, like the, you know, NC-17.

24:43.499 --> 24:45.460
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just people don't treat it that way.

24:45.500 --> 24:49.741
[SPEAKER_07]: And then until someone goes and murders somebody, then they're all, oh, my God, it was the game's fault.

24:49.901 --> 24:50.821
[SPEAKER_07]: I had no idea.

24:50.841 --> 24:50.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

24:52.455 --> 24:53.917
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:10.113 --> 25:11.174
[SPEAKER_07]: Some interesting stuff.

25:11.615 --> 25:20.603
[SPEAKER_07]: This has kind of been a trend with Microsoft right now, securing a lot of exclusive rights to things, one of which being Grand Theft Auto 4 episodic content.

25:21.003 --> 25:33.174
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they've spent $50 million in securing this episodic content, which to me, that seems like an awful lot of money to spend to secure content for a game that's downloadable.

25:34.094 --> 25:35.656
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be very interested if...

25:37.406 --> 25:39.486
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some announcements at E3 or something.

25:39.686 --> 25:47.728
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking that maybe they're going to announce that it's going to be an Xbox 360 exclusive for the game because that's quite a bit of money that they're throwing at them.

25:47.828 --> 25:49.168
[SPEAKER_07]: But whatever, either way.

25:50.928 --> 26:02.110
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, so if you own the 360, you're going to be able to download, I guess, the episodic content in about two batches, one of which is supposed to hit mid-next year and then the rest at the end of next year.

26:02.931 --> 26:03.871
[SPEAKER_07]: So $25 million for each.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.561
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26:26.656 --> 26:32.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say they sell 5 million copies of the game, at least, on Xbox 360.

26:32.581 --> 26:35.804
[SPEAKER_06]: They sell 5 million copies of the game, and people are going to download this.

26:35.824 --> 26:38.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say they charge $10 for the episodic content.

26:39.127 --> 26:40.909
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to make their $50 million back right there.

26:41.029 --> 26:47.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, granted, I'm assuming that everybody's going to buy it, which isn't going to happen, but I'm only considering one piece of downloadable content for $10.

26:48.135 --> 26:52.579
[SPEAKER_06]: If they release three pieces of downloadable content for $10, they'll more than make their money back, and then some.

26:53.143 --> 26:57.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, they have something that Sony doesn't, which in the end might move some consoles and so on and so on.

26:57.787 --> 27:00.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know people that are holding out for this game.

27:00.248 --> 27:05.893
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, gamer picks and themes and all sorts of crap that they can market using Grand Theft Auto.

27:08.415 --> 27:08.895
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

27:11.397 --> 27:11.957
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

27:12.017 --> 27:15.500
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, I'm not too surprised that they're actually doing this.

27:15.560 --> 27:21.885
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the PlayStation Network so far, downloadable content for games has been almost non-existent.

27:22.789 --> 27:34.659
[SPEAKER_06]: So now just to clear this up, because I'm still a little unsure on this, because I seem to remember when this game was first announced, they said, okay, the PlayStation 3 is going to have this downloadable content, and the Xbox 360 will have this different downloadable content.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft is basically paid to stop the PlayStation 3 exclusive content from coming out at all.

27:40.825 --> 27:41.265
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

27:42.026 --> 27:42.406
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

27:44.233 --> 27:51.579
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's why they did it, to try and move some more systems and get people, because the game will be that much more on the 360.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.503
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this isn't the first game that they were doing this.

27:55.523 --> 28:00.707
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, now they're saying that Beautiful Katamari is going to be a 360 exclusive as well.

28:01.167 --> 28:01.808
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows about that?

28:02.629 --> 28:04.430
[SPEAKER_06]: GS191 says something interesting.

28:04.470 --> 28:07.613
[SPEAKER_06]: The three items for download, a gun, a car, and a sex minigame.

28:08.976 --> 28:10.838
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be stupid shit like that.

28:10.898 --> 28:15.662
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be actual episodic, brand new storylines and stuff like that.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.723
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like you get a brand new gun.

28:18.744 --> 28:22.907
[SPEAKER_06]: Blackboy says Take-Two is actually talking about selling 10 million units by the end of 2008.

28:24.141 --> 28:24.381
[SPEAKER_06]: We shall see.

28:44.693 --> 29:01.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of downloadable content, Eidos UK has said that the Tomb Raider Anniversary for Xbox 360 is, well, going to be available as a series of downloads in conjunction with Tomb Raider Legend.

29:02.446 --> 29:14.314
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, you're downloading each of them as different, I guess, different parts of the game, with free downloads being available

29:14.767 --> 29:17.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura's Manor, all that type of stuff.

29:17.890 --> 29:22.935
[SPEAKER_02]: However, each of these episodes are going to be about $30 a piece, 2,400 Microsoft points.

29:23.575 --> 29:28.560
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't suppose there will be a downloadable topless Laura patch like there was on the PC versions.

29:29.400 --> 29:29.541
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

29:30.281 --> 29:31.422
[SPEAKER_06]: That's most unfortunate.

29:33.424 --> 29:35.466
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that the first two are going to be available in September.

29:36.287 --> 29:36.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

29:36.877 --> 29:39.638
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know though, I kind of don't care about Tomb Raider anymore.

29:39.678 --> 29:47.160
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I played that Tomb Raider game on 360, didn't really, like the full, I don't even remember what it was called, the retail release that came out a few months ago, didn't really dig it.

29:47.340 --> 29:49.060
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of over Lara Croft.

29:49.420 --> 29:56.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't really cared about her since you could throw her off the balcony in Tomb Raider 2 and break her neck and do the exploding code.

29:56.422 --> 29:57.603
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of fun to kill her off.

29:57.843 --> 30:00.363
[SPEAKER_02]: And lock her up, butler in the lock-in freezer.

30:01.204 --> 30:01.804
[SPEAKER_02]: The lock-in freezer.

30:02.084 --> 30:02.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you really do that?

30:03.064 --> 30:03.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you could.

30:03.464 --> 30:05.325
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way you could keep them from following you.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.225
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

30:07.072 --> 30:08.594
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

30:32.574 --> 30:38.259
[SPEAKER_06]: A Donkey Kong Bongo Blast and Tarou Jet Race is coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June 28th.

30:38.319 --> 30:42.243
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that is the bongoless bongo game because you have the Wiimotes.

30:43.322 --> 30:43.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Baroque

31:02.181 --> 31:07.342
[SPEAKER_06]: from Sting, a special edition of Devil May Cry 3, but that's just a price reduction, really.

31:08.323 --> 31:12.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, an earlier version of Dragon Quest goes into the Ultimate Hits Collection.

31:12.303 --> 31:14.904
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe this is one of the side quest stories.

31:15.424 --> 31:27.687
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, a special edition thing for Devil May Cry 3, I believe is the one that they released over here, where it was the greatest hits, but they also added an additional playable character and additional difficulties.

31:28.499 --> 31:32.081
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a reduction for a Dragon Quest VIII spinoff story that was on the PlayStation 2.

31:32.322 --> 31:33.682
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't remember this game being here.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.524
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they ever ported this over here.

31:35.564 --> 31:38.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps somebody else in our chatroom knows a little more about that game.

31:38.706 --> 31:39.926
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think that game ever came out here.

31:39.946 --> 31:43.128
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's because the game is way bigger over in Japan.

31:43.549 --> 31:47.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out, Metal Slug on the PlayStation 2.

31:47.711 --> 31:48.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

31:48.652 --> 31:49.533
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving into the best hits.

31:49.573 --> 31:49.753
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

31:49.793 --> 31:50.013
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

31:50.173 --> 31:50.513
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

31:51.494 --> 31:51.934
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

31:54.496 --> 31:55.597
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Metal Slug.

31:55.737 --> 31:56.257
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll kill you.

31:58.129 --> 31:58.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

31:58.849 --> 32:05.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out on June 28th in Japan, Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra.

32:05.531 --> 32:05.811
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

32:06.531 --> 32:07.151
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

32:07.371 --> 32:07.631
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

32:08.591 --> 32:13.032
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they keep putting out games for that anime that's been, what, 10 years gone now?

32:13.092 --> 32:14.113
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people buy them.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.233
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones on Saturn sucked.

32:16.253 --> 32:18.254
[SPEAKER_02]: The one on Nintendo 64 sucked.

32:18.794 --> 32:19.814
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do they keep doing it?

32:20.382 --> 32:21.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Tales of Fandom Vol.

32:22.444 --> 32:26.367
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 coming out from Namco Bandai on June 28th, also on the PlayStation 2.

32:26.767 --> 32:31.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Taito Memories, also known as Eternal Hits, coming out in two versions.

32:31.711 --> 32:33.352
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Gekkan and Jukkan.

32:33.632 --> 32:39.837
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that's very similar to what we have over here is the Taito Greatest Hits Collection, the comparable thing we have here already in America.

32:40.653 --> 32:41.654
[SPEAKER_06]: also coming out in Japan.

32:41.694 --> 32:45.757
[SPEAKER_06]: The King of Fighters 11 moving into the Best Hits collection on the 28th.

32:45.917 --> 32:48.719
[SPEAKER_06]: SNK is moving a lot of stuff into Best Hits on PlayStation 2.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.322
[SPEAKER_06]: We're quickly checking the handheld systems.

32:53.062 --> 32:56.185
[SPEAKER_06]: Kurikuri DS is coming out on June 28th.

32:56.525 --> 32:57.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Otasuke Island.

32:58.246 --> 33:01.528
[SPEAKER_06]: This looks like one of those cute little chibi games.

33:01.909 --> 33:02.990
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's an action game.

33:03.790 --> 33:04.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like with bunnies.

33:05.131 --> 33:07.113
[SPEAKER_06]: And an angry pink bunny sailing a ship.

33:07.193 --> 33:07.413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's...

33:08.390 --> 33:09.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Otona no Joryoku Kentai

33:35.695 --> 33:37.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of releases here on June 28th.

33:37.436 --> 33:41.458
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratchet & Clank gets its BSP release on June 28th.

33:42.019 --> 33:50.083
[SPEAKER_06]: And just for Jamie, Secret of Evangelion Portable coming out on the 28th.

33:51.784 --> 33:52.144
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

33:55.266 --> 33:58.248
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish it was all Neon Genesis over here, too.

33:58.268 --> 33:58.828
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be funny.

34:00.011 --> 34:00.451
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not.

34:01.092 --> 34:03.733
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyways, next week there's a ton of releases.

34:03.993 --> 34:06.354
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them coming out based on movies.

34:06.995 --> 34:09.336
[SPEAKER_07]: One of which is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.657
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be coming out on almost everything.

34:11.857 --> 34:17.960
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 2, PSP, 360, PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

34:18.020 --> 34:20.301
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP and I believe DS also.

34:22.082 --> 34:24.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, of course, Ratatouille.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.064
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be coming out on almost everything.

34:26.204 --> 34:27.505
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 2, GameCube.

34:28.474 --> 34:32.177
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii, DS, and PSP.

34:34.840 --> 34:40.904
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Transformers, that's going to be coming out on all the console systems, so that'll be pretty cool.

34:41.905 --> 34:48.090
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the Wii, we've got Pokemon Battle Revolution, so that's pretty slick.

34:48.991 --> 34:57.338
[SPEAKER_07]: The Biggs is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PlayStation 3, and 360, kind of like an arcade-style baseball game.

34:58.281 --> 35:00.583
[SPEAKER_07]: Grim Grimoire is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

35:01.143 --> 35:02.284
[SPEAKER_07]: That one's supposed to be pretty good.

35:03.485 --> 35:10.109
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, PSP, just this small little game called Final Fantasy is going to be coming out as well.

35:10.870 --> 35:12.311
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that game about?

35:12.351 --> 35:13.051
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard of it.

35:13.432 --> 35:16.674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I hear it's kind of a Japanese-style game.

35:16.834 --> 35:17.634
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, then never mind.

35:17.855 --> 35:19.636
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I'll be playing that.

35:20.276 --> 35:23.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, of course, this is actually something I'm interested in, TraxPad.

35:24.039 --> 35:27.001
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of a portable...

35:28.260 --> 35:29.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Music Studio type thing.

35:29.641 --> 35:31.142
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to be picking that up.

35:31.323 --> 35:32.424
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe make some music with that.

35:33.765 --> 35:37.648
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on 360 also we had Hour of Victory coming out.

35:37.828 --> 35:39.769
[SPEAKER_07]: Overlord is making its way out here.

35:40.410 --> 35:44.613
[SPEAKER_07]: And on PlayStation 3, hopefully, Rainbow Six Vegas.

35:45.294 --> 35:48.537
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that thing's been delayed so many freaking times.

35:50.498 --> 35:51.339
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that's it.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.157
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some stuff.

35:53.677 --> 35:54.057
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

35:54.698 --> 35:55.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose release dates do you have?

35:56.019 --> 35:57.620
[SPEAKER_02]: These are UK release dates.

35:58.020 --> 36:03.023
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 26th, we have Cosmic Family for Wii and Harry Potter and the Odor of Phoenix.

36:03.724 --> 36:04.124
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Odor.

36:04.144 --> 36:04.344
[SPEAKER_07]: Odor.

36:05.865 --> 36:07.587
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a bunch of crap on the 29th.

36:07.687 --> 36:11.749
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars on PSP.

36:12.230 --> 36:13.190
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Crazy Taxi.

36:13.711 --> 36:14.872
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy Taxi.

36:15.192 --> 36:19.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Driver Parallel Lines, Final Fantasy VI Advance, which I already have in my purse.

36:20.503 --> 36:29.527
[SPEAKER_02]: Hour of Victory, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition, More Brain Training from Dr. Kalashima, How Old is Your Brain, Project Silphid, I want Project Silphid!

36:29.867 --> 36:30.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

36:30.747 --> 36:31.488
[SPEAKER_07]: A few more weeks.

36:31.888 --> 36:33.629
[SPEAKER_02]: A few more weeks.

36:34.429 --> 36:35.509
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you have no idea.

36:35.770 --> 36:38.571
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the shit out of Silphid on the Sega CD.

36:38.651 --> 36:39.771
[SPEAKER_07]: Second week in July.

36:40.592 --> 36:43.613
[SPEAKER_02]: When I saw the thing for Project Silphid, I about...

36:44.349 --> 36:47.491
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37:10.865 --> 37:12.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a bad fanfiction.

37:13.467 --> 37:15.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter 2.

37:16.470 --> 37:18.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Vegas.

37:19.653 --> 37:19.893
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

37:20.293 --> 37:21.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Vampire Reign.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Agon, Lost Swords of Toledo.

37:24.917 --> 37:25.678
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like Ohio?

37:26.338 --> 37:26.979
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this Toledo?

37:27.539 --> 37:28.280
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that Ohio?

37:29.401 --> 37:31.603
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're going to Ohio to look for the sword.

37:32.143 --> 37:34.886
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eye of Shit, I mean Eye of Judgment.

37:36.127 --> 37:37.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, Eye of Judgment?

37:37.188 --> 37:37.968
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, no, no, no.

37:38.028 --> 37:38.429
[SPEAKER_00]: PlayStation 3.

37:39.536 --> 37:40.157
[SPEAKER_06]: and Steel Horizons.

37:47.550 --> 37:50.833
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, there's a few that I missed for the US.

37:50.893 --> 37:54.755
[SPEAKER_07]: Darkness, which isn't just a fan fiction, I hope you know.

37:55.216 --> 37:57.978
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a Top Cow comic, I believe.

37:58.618 --> 38:00.580
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was published by Image as well.

38:00.880 --> 38:08.405
[SPEAKER_07]: Being made into a live action movie as well, it's kind of like a cross between demonic possession and a mafia story type thing.

38:08.445 --> 38:10.326
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically rip people apart with demons.

38:11.627 --> 38:11.807
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

38:12.864 --> 38:13.364
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the other one?

38:13.444 --> 38:15.185
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Driver Parallel Lines for the Wii.

38:15.305 --> 38:17.786
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, you probably don't want to pick that one up anyways, so.

38:18.606 --> 38:19.346
[SPEAKER_07]: Darkness.

38:21.607 --> 38:24.568
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that a cliche thing to call your game or whatever?

38:24.688 --> 38:25.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Darkness?

38:25.348 --> 38:25.668
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

38:25.808 --> 38:27.649
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the name of the comic book series.

38:27.869 --> 38:28.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, fine.

38:28.229 --> 38:28.829
[SPEAKER_07]: The Darkness.

38:29.049 --> 38:30.090
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

38:30.310 --> 38:32.370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the demonic thing that possessed him.

38:32.390 --> 38:34.891
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anything else, DarkSakura for our UK listeners?

38:35.171 --> 38:35.852
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mom.

38:36.372 --> 38:36.692
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

38:36.832 --> 38:38.332
[SPEAKER_06]: What platform is she coming out on?

38:38.532 --> 38:39.673
[SPEAKER_02]: The Last Night platform.

38:39.693 --> 38:40.013
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.481
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

39:04.634 --> 39:08.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you'll notice that the Wii, now people don't really know what this is.

39:08.315 --> 39:13.537
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is like a typo, if they just meant to put Dr. Mario and they put like the Wii or whatever is in there.

39:13.797 --> 39:16.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if this is actually like a whole new game.

39:17.199 --> 39:18.839
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, wouldn't that be something?

39:18.919 --> 39:21.740
[SPEAKER_06]: A whole new game based on Dr. Mario.

39:22.381 --> 39:23.501
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like fun to me.

39:23.561 --> 39:31.424
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be really impressed if it were SNK, but unfortunately... I don't think it would be, seeing as Dr. Mario is a Nintendo license.

39:32.734 --> 39:34.635
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm talking about the whole new game part.

39:34.995 --> 39:35.375
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

39:36.796 --> 39:39.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well that's pretty much it, so be on the lookout for that.

39:39.717 --> 39:42.458
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully that Dr. Mario Wii thing is a new thing.

39:42.498 --> 39:48.821
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in my mind, if that is something new, that would be the perfect thing to release the week of E3.

39:49.441 --> 39:49.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark my words.

39:50.661 --> 39:51.782
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Mario Wii.

39:52.421 --> 39:53.121
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a start.

39:53.341 --> 39:58.323
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, you know, probably a game that a lot of us are going to get super-duper excited about, but it's a start.

39:58.423 --> 40:00.044
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something we don't have yet.

40:00.384 --> 40:00.824
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

40:00.864 --> 40:03.505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something new being made for the Wii, if that makes any sense.

40:04.586 --> 40:06.526
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better than Everybody Votes Channel, okay?

40:06.586 --> 40:07.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just leave it at that.

40:08.567 --> 40:10.208
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody Votes Channel!

40:11.788 --> 40:13.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody votes to change this channel.

40:14.109 --> 40:15.610
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate that channel, by the way.

40:16.110 --> 40:17.951
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, completely useless.

40:19.131 --> 40:19.431
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

40:19.451 --> 40:20.072
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

40:21.613 --> 40:24.595
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting rumor, kind of also associated with Nintendo here.

40:25.696 --> 40:34.321
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be that they will be licensing their properties to be made into games onto the Apple iPhone.

40:37.843 --> 40:46.148
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone remembers that back in the day there was a certain platform which they licensed their games to be made onto.

40:48.910 --> 40:51.291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, CDI games didn't turn out very well.

40:52.369 --> 40:58.095
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently they're supposed to be coming out on the iPhone priced at about $29 each.

40:58.535 --> 41:06.783
[SPEAKER_07]: So is $29 worth paying for a downloadable game that's going to be probably a remake of Mario Bros.?

41:07.984 --> 41:08.384
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

41:08.645 --> 41:09.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds more like a rumor to me.

41:11.016 --> 41:14.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the most interesting thing about this story, like I could kind of care less about the game.

41:14.678 --> 41:20.400
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally am not interested in the iPhone, but I have a lot of friends who are like doing the campout thing and all that crap to get this stupid phone.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my thing, but I don't have $600 to burn.

41:24.322 --> 41:26.142
[SPEAKER_06]: But for those that want it, hey, good for you.

41:26.222 --> 41:26.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have a loan?

41:27.603 --> 41:32.545
[SPEAKER_06]: But the point behind this story, Yuri Lover in chat sums it up perfectly.

41:32.705 --> 41:34.646
[SPEAKER_06]: OMG, Nintendo and Apple are in bed together.

41:35.446 --> 41:38.927
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what the fanboys wanted years ago.

41:39.247 --> 41:42.588
[SPEAKER_06]: They kept saying, gee, Nintendo likes to put cute things out.

41:42.988 --> 41:45.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Apple likes to put cute things out in different colors, just like Nintendo.

41:46.108 --> 41:47.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Why aren't these companies in bed together?

41:48.189 --> 41:49.449
[SPEAKER_06]: And here they go.

41:49.829 --> 41:52.770
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a little foreplay going on here with this story, right?

41:53.770 --> 41:54.530
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this foreplay?

41:54.970 --> 41:56.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a rumor, to be honest.

41:57.310 --> 41:58.591
[SPEAKER_07]: You think this is just bullshit?

41:58.611 --> 41:59.891
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is bullshit, but...

42:00.796 --> 42:03.458
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it wouldn't surprise me that they're going to try to whore themselves out.

42:03.578 --> 42:10.763
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wouldn't surprise me that stupid morons that pay $600 for a fucking phone would pay $30 for downloadable content on said phone.

42:11.523 --> 42:13.224
[SPEAKER_07]: Geniuses that buy this shit.

42:13.404 --> 42:14.885
[SPEAKER_07]: So, way to go.

42:15.566 --> 42:16.006
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

42:16.066 --> 42:20.729
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you should go purchase a PlayStation 3 while you're at it since you have all this excess money to throw around.

42:22.330 --> 42:23.431
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you just mad because you're poor?

42:23.971 --> 42:25.632
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't want this fucking phone.

42:25.792 --> 42:27.093
[SPEAKER_07]: I would not pay $600 for a goddamn phone.

42:28.800 --> 42:34.563
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, for anyone who is one of our friends in the UK, they just got a big treat on the virtual console.

42:35.363 --> 42:35.943
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what's out?

42:36.964 --> 42:37.984
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man!

42:38.104 --> 42:38.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Your mom, oh.

42:39.205 --> 42:41.566
[SPEAKER_02]: No, my mom doesn't put out for anything.

42:41.586 --> 42:42.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Mom.

42:43.547 --> 42:50.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man just made it out for 500 Wii points, and from TurboGrafx-16, China Warriors is another new one on there.

42:51.250 --> 42:52.771
[SPEAKER_02]: They are both games from 1989.

42:52.811 --> 42:52.871
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

42:57.245 --> 43:01.867
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'm just excited about Mega Man because, you know, all the Mega Man 2, though, was really the better game.

43:01.887 --> 43:03.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man, though, was really cool.

43:04.348 --> 43:05.649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the ones that has beaten.

43:05.669 --> 43:12.992
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Mega Man and all, but what about, you know, the whole Mega Man collection that was on GameCube and the Wii's backwards compatible, you know?

43:13.012 --> 43:13.512
[SPEAKER_02]: Do people care?

43:13.792 --> 43:14.213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me.

43:14.633 --> 43:17.574
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to spend money on the virtual console Mega Man when that game's out there.

43:17.634 --> 43:20.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, neither am I. I mean, I have the freaking cartridge.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.996
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I can't lend you one of my Nintendos, but that's another story.

43:25.618 --> 43:26.518
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know...

43:27.600 --> 43:32.822
[SPEAKER_02]: But for people who may not have bought the collection or may just say, oh, well, that's pretty cool, Mega Man.

43:32.862 --> 43:34.042
[SPEAKER_02]: They might want to get it.

43:34.282 --> 43:37.203
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, for lazy people who are one-click shoppers.

43:37.743 --> 43:37.923
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

43:38.123 --> 43:38.363
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

43:38.403 --> 43:38.743
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

43:38.803 --> 43:39.203
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

43:39.603 --> 43:39.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

43:39.884 --> 43:40.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Then carry on.

43:40.664 --> 43:41.744
[SPEAKER_02]: And talk to me later about the Nintendo.

43:41.984 --> 43:42.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Carry on.

43:42.724 --> 43:43.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say you can?

43:43.505 --> 43:44.705
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like three.

43:44.745 --> 43:45.305
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow one.

43:45.405 --> 43:45.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

43:45.725 --> 43:46.665
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you said you can't.

43:46.946 --> 43:47.026
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

43:47.046 --> 43:47.666
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, oh, okay.

43:47.806 --> 43:48.146
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, ma'am.

43:48.526 --> 43:49.406
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow one of our older ones.

43:49.486 --> 43:49.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Swell.

43:50.286 --> 43:52.347
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally going to get a copy of Guardian Legend for myself.

43:52.667 --> 43:53.687
[SPEAKER_02]: You can borrow mine, too, if you want.

43:54.408 --> 43:54.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesomeness.

43:54.968 --> 43:55.588
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not playing it.

43:56.469 --> 43:58.611
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can only tear myself away from World of Warcraft.

43:58.632 --> 44:05.779
[SPEAKER_07]: There are free, easier methods to obtain Guardian Legends to play it on a console.

44:05.819 --> 44:06.840
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same.

44:07.180 --> 44:07.961
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same.

44:08.041 --> 44:08.782
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't explain it.

44:08.862 --> 44:09.523
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same.

44:09.583 --> 44:11.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Those little imperfections bug me.

44:11.865 --> 44:17.290
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something rewarding about blowing on the cartridge and putting it in the machine and it'll finally work at some point.

44:17.311 --> 44:18.552
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

44:18.572 --> 44:19.693
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something rewarding about that.

44:20.578 --> 44:29.826
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully there's a lot of rewards from this game as well, or else there's going to be a lot of people that are pissed off because Spore, which you might remember was my favorite game I saw at last year's E3.

44:30.146 --> 44:38.052
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm going to be waiting a long freaking time to play this game, as are all of you, because this game has been pushed back to the fiscal year 2009.

44:40.354 --> 44:44.618
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that it will, at earliest, come out in April of 2008.

44:46.379 --> 44:50.022
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, some folks were, you know, this game was already supposed to be out.

44:50.905 --> 44:52.505
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it got pushed back to this fiscal year.

44:52.866 --> 44:54.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it got pushed back to next fiscal year.

44:54.326 --> 44:56.306
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it was like, oh, it's going to come out by the Christmas.

44:56.747 --> 44:57.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's going to come out first quarter 2008.

44:58.727 --> 44:59.607
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go again.

44:59.647 --> 45:04.069
[SPEAKER_06]: It just got delayed to April 2008 at the earliest.

45:04.589 --> 45:09.710
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's so weird because when we saw the demo, I was like, this game looks like it's almost done.

45:10.390 --> 45:11.330
[SPEAKER_06]: The game looks great.

45:11.390 --> 45:15.171
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe that's why they only showed us one element of the game.

45:15.211 --> 45:16.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe looks can be deceiving.

45:16.832 --> 45:17.032
[SPEAKER_06]: But

45:17.793 --> 45:18.213
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

45:18.693 --> 45:21.176
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that it's a massive game and they want to make sure they get it right.

45:21.436 --> 45:21.777
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

45:22.057 --> 45:22.938
[SPEAKER_02]: For a change!

45:23.078 --> 45:23.458
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

45:24.940 --> 45:28.163
[SPEAKER_06]: Gerardimo calls this game in our chatroom Spore Forever.

45:28.664 --> 45:30.105
[SPEAKER_06]: A little play on Duke Nukem Forever.

45:30.186 --> 45:30.446
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

45:31.149 --> 45:47.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but at least we've actually seen screenshots and like, you know, playable sport, like, you know, because they show, I mean, even though you weren't able to play the demo yourself, they did kind of like a, you know, a user-assisted tutorial type thing at E3 and it looked pretty awesome.

45:47.246 --> 45:51.931
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was awesome enough to get me the most excited over any other game I saw at E3 last year.

45:51.951 --> 45:52.912
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked awesome.

45:53.843 --> 45:56.966
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, I am pissed off about the fact that this game is delayed.

45:57.006 --> 46:04.672
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how Loki and DarkSakura feel, but since I'm at the soundboard and I'm angry enough, I push the button and out come the FUs.

46:15.441 --> 46:16.722
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, start us off.

46:17.963 --> 46:18.603
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to life.

46:20.345 --> 46:21.146
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to hear that.

46:21.786 --> 46:22.026
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it?

46:22.046 --> 46:22.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

46:23.191 --> 46:23.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

46:24.151 --> 46:26.752
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a good blanket FU to kind of encompass everything.

46:27.332 --> 46:29.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, because there's a whole bunch of shit going on, so FU to all of it.

46:30.393 --> 46:30.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to hear that.

46:31.013 --> 46:31.293
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

46:33.374 --> 46:38.595
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, I would like to repeat my distaste for Street Smart Cool Cat.

46:38.815 --> 46:46.097
[SPEAKER_07]: That fucking idiot can die in a fire, and I hope your game sucks balls and does not sell one piece.

46:46.537 --> 46:49.098
[SPEAKER_07]: It is horrible, and you need to stop.

46:51.187 --> 46:59.857
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to say F you to Bobby Blackwolf for correcting me in chat saying Duke Nukem Forever was playable at E3 1998 on the Quake 2 engine.

47:01.619 --> 47:02.259
[SPEAKER_06]: F you, Bobby.

47:03.341 --> 47:05.884
[SPEAKER_06]: And your old show, 100 Weeks, whatever.

47:06.464 --> 47:06.524
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

47:07.702 --> 47:08.683
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding, I heart Bobby.

47:09.323 --> 47:14.606
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to say a big F you to the DMV.

47:15.026 --> 47:17.688
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have to go there tomorrow and nobody likes going to the DMV.

47:17.908 --> 47:24.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have to get my license renewed because my birthday is coming up and I got to get that all taken care of before my birthday or else I won't have a driver's license.

47:24.832 --> 47:26.833
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the possibility I may not have a driver's license.

47:30.595 --> 47:30.895
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

47:31.656 --> 47:41.441
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so there's something actually pretty cool coming out of the homebrew scene, and that is a sequel, a homebrew sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog.

47:42.162 --> 47:43.382
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually looks pretty cool.

47:43.702 --> 47:56.969
[SPEAKER_07]: The name of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog XG, or Extended Genesis, and pretty much captures the original Sonic the Hedgehog game series very accurately.

47:57.029 --> 47:58.290
[SPEAKER_07]: It's scheduled to have

47:58.920 --> 48:28.244
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 unique zones, 18 acts along with his secret zone after Chaos Central and no word though on what it's coming out on I would assume PC but pretty awesome they have a video on Destructoid if you want to check it out really cool looking game I'm not really a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog series so hopefully it gets released and you can download it before Sega's lawyers get on them that would be nice

48:28.891 --> 48:36.814
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, other Sonic news that I think is actually kind of cool is Bioware is doing a Sonic RPG that's going to be on the Nintendo DS.

48:37.214 --> 48:38.815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be out in 2008.

48:39.495 --> 48:49.680
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a whole bunch out on it, but it's just saying that Sega is standing behind what Bioware has planned doing and Bioware wants to do it, blah, blah, blah.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.260
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I hope it's good.

48:51.820 --> 48:52.181
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.

48:52.981 --> 48:57.603
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they did good stuff for... Didn't they do Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic?

48:57.703 --> 48:57.843
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

49:00.440 --> 49:05.244
[SPEAKER_07]: and the upcoming Mass Effect game, which is going to be like one of the best role-playing games for the 360.

49:05.524 --> 49:05.984
[SPEAKER_06]: You hope.

49:06.765 --> 49:09.146
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks... It does look pretty freaking amazing.

49:09.166 --> 49:09.486
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.

49:11.788 --> 49:16.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I hear about this, I think about the Mario RPG for some sick reason.

49:16.071 --> 49:29.260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because, you know, Squeenix helped make, well, it was just Square back then, but Squaresoft made the, you know, Mario RPG game and that was like a top-of-the-line developer, especially back at that time at the, you know, I remember Final Fantasy was like all the rage at that point, you know.

49:29.670 --> 49:36.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of interesting that now you have this Bioware who's kind of like, you know, also an A-list developer kind of making this Sonic RPG.

49:36.392 --> 49:40.274
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope it doesn't blow chunks like all the other Sonic games that have come out in the past three years.

49:42.035 --> 49:42.755
[SPEAKER_06]: My thoughts exactly.

49:43.115 --> 49:49.217
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me also pissed off because remember there was, I think, Square Enix was saying that they wanted to dedicate themselves to the Nintendo platforms.

49:49.517 --> 49:51.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Make me another goddamn Super Mario RPG!

49:52.138 --> 49:56.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Since you've dedicated yourself to the Nintendo platforms, why don't you make yourself useful?

49:57.546 --> 50:00.530
[SPEAKER_07]: Do that instead of making another fucking sequel to Final Fantasy 7.

50:02.572 --> 50:05.775
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a BlackDevilerX in chat says, Sega and Bioware are in bed.

50:06.616 --> 50:08.198
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of in bed stories tonight.

50:08.218 --> 50:08.799
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with that?

50:09.419 --> 50:09.860
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

50:10.438 --> 50:10.978
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

50:35.430 --> 50:36.050
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:00.633 --> 51:03.655
[SPEAKER_06]: says, quote, there seems to be some misinformation flying around.

51:04.036 --> 51:11.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing's changed since our call on May 8th, where John Riccatello specifically said that we were removing Spore from fiscal 08 to early fiscal 09.

51:13.482 --> 51:16.524
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe that Spore thing wasn't news after all.

51:16.544 --> 51:17.445
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm still angsty about it.

51:17.465 --> 51:18.405
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a long time to wait.

51:18.826 --> 51:21.027
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually still was thinking it was coming out Christmas this year.

51:21.067 --> 51:22.588
[SPEAKER_06]: I somehow missed the boat on that story.

51:23.009 --> 51:23.449
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

51:24.127 --> 51:25.588
[SPEAKER_06]: But nevertheless, thanks for the corrections.

51:25.829 --> 51:30.633
[SPEAKER_06]: We report on what's big on the gaming blogs out there and what catches our eye.

51:31.254 --> 51:33.936
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not always going to be 100% on target.

51:34.577 --> 51:35.337
[SPEAKER_06]: But we try to get close.

51:35.898 --> 51:39.021
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully this is accurate because this is something trying to foresee things a little bit.

51:39.381 --> 51:45.607
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be the list of Halo 3 achievements coming to you thanks to Xbox360achievements.org.

51:45.947 --> 51:50.031
[SPEAKER_06]: So for those of you that are achievement point whores, Loki, bye in the game.

51:50.782 --> 51:52.703
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:20.536 --> 52:25.273
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, some hidden skulls looking like they claim some different achievements throughout the game.

52:25.720 --> 52:29.282
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course there's some various player versus player achievements.

52:29.943 --> 52:35.987
[SPEAKER_06]: Awards being given for triple kill, overkill, headshots and then some achievements.

52:36.287 --> 52:37.388
[SPEAKER_00]: Headshots are the best.

52:37.528 --> 52:51.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Some achievements still in question because you actually see the achievement says score over X amount of points in the campaign made a game on the second mission for some various achievements named such thing as Demon, Gorilla, Vanguard, Reclaimer.

52:52.298 --> 52:55.360
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like about nine different achievements there so kind of interesting.

52:56.127 --> 52:59.048
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what the achievements look like for Halo 3.

53:00.288 --> 53:03.590
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone was asking me in chat room what my favorite all-time first-person shooter is.

53:04.170 --> 53:05.070
[SPEAKER_07]: TimeSplitters 2.

53:06.431 --> 53:07.611
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking awesome game.

53:08.631 --> 53:11.612
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, let's see here.

53:12.293 --> 53:18.415
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's some interesting developments in the whole immersion thing.

53:18.435 --> 53:24.197
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember back, immersion, of course, sued Sony over the rumble technology in their controllers.

53:25.362 --> 53:27.784
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now we've got Microsoft suing Immersion.

53:28.344 --> 53:40.714
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason is, is because apparently because of the whole Sony lawsuit, and since they settled on that, that violates some sort of agreement that Microsoft had with Immersion when they were licensing the technology.

53:41.094 --> 53:44.197
[SPEAKER_07]: And according to Microsoft, Microsoft licenses technology in both

53:44.597 --> 53:44.877
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor babies.

53:44.957 --> 53:45.037
[SPEAKER_07]: Aww.

54:14.409 --> 54:15.570
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's pout and sue.

54:15.830 --> 54:20.972
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly... Somebody remind me, because I haven't really been following the details of all these stories.

54:20.992 --> 54:23.473
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just see the headlines and I go, oh, lawsuit, lawsuit.

54:23.813 --> 54:25.854
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly has Immersion done for gaming?

54:26.894 --> 54:29.095
[SPEAKER_06]: They developed, apparently, Rumble technology.

54:29.335 --> 54:32.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, they developed Rumble technology.

54:32.237 --> 54:39.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have trademarks, so... But was it one of those things where, like... Because I remember, did they develop the first... What is it?

54:39.520 --> 54:42.161
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak was the first thing that had Rumble, right?

54:42.181 --> 54:42.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

54:43.132 --> 54:43.933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.

54:44.253 --> 54:45.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they develop that?

54:45.514 --> 54:46.675
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

54:47.316 --> 54:54.042
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those companies that makes a patent or patents something and then sits on it until someone makes it and then they go and sue them.

54:55.303 --> 54:55.784
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

54:57.085 --> 55:01.649
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm like, what exactly has a merchant done besides sue people and get sued?

55:02.430 --> 55:03.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, have they ever made a game?

55:03.711 --> 55:05.213
[SPEAKER_06]: Have they ever made a third-party product?

55:05.873 --> 55:06.113
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

55:06.914 --> 55:07.415
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

55:08.115 --> 55:08.396
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

55:09.315 --> 55:12.356
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

55:37.850 --> 55:42.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's website of the week is one that should be nearing dear to the hearts of anyone who has ever gotten married.

55:44.455 --> 55:46.436
[SPEAKER_02]: It's UglyDress.com.

55:47.396 --> 55:52.780
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows the worst bridesmaids' dresses ever with photographs.

55:53.821 --> 55:54.942
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are really awful.

55:56.202 --> 56:00.866
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one on here that looks like a flag.

56:02.287 --> 56:04.208
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even joking, it's really nasty.

56:06.178 --> 56:15.340
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's, it's not just weddings either, it's, it's like ugly cakes and, uh, like ugly shoes and tuxedos and shit.

56:15.420 --> 56:18.661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just awful, awful stuff.

56:19.021 --> 56:27.563
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some show that they all watch on Ventrilo in World of Warcraft, the guild, and it's something, it's very similar to what you're talking about.

56:27.603 --> 56:28.503
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's like, um,

56:29.431 --> 56:29.811
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

56:54.245 --> 56:58.447
[SPEAKER_06]: It picks up, so we just hear this random laughing, and we're like, what the hell is so goddamn funny?

56:58.807 --> 57:04.609
[SPEAKER_06]: And she says, oh, I'm watching this show that's like some type of like, I don't know what it is, emergency makeover show.

57:07.030 --> 57:09.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, I shouldn't have opened my mouth unless I could think of the name of the show.

57:09.571 --> 57:13.873
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I was kind of hoping that somebody in chat would know what it's about.

57:16.229 --> 57:20.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I looked up Immersion Corporation, by the way, on Wikipedia.

57:20.974 --> 57:25.700
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf in chat came to save the day, because BlackWolf knows more about gaming than I do, apparently.

57:26.440 --> 57:28.943
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf said, And I'm looking at Wikipedia here.

57:34.875 --> 57:38.716
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion Corporation of San Jose, California is a developer of Haptic Technology.

57:39.036 --> 57:39.936
[SPEAKER_06]: The company was founded in 1993.

57:40.336 --> 57:49.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion's technology is employed in automotive, entertainment, medical training, mobility, personal computing, and three-dimensional simulation applications.

57:49.838 --> 57:54.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion's patent portfolio includes over 500 issues or pending patents in the U.S.

57:54.218 --> 57:54.918
[SPEAKER_06]: and other countries.

57:55.439 --> 58:00.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Immersion was used as an example in an article on patent trolls by Game Daily Biz.

58:00.719 --> 58:03.220
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess we're not the first people to say something about that.

58:04.212 --> 58:05.553
[SPEAKER_06]: Kudos to Game Daily Biz.

58:05.893 --> 58:07.694
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad they have something called Patent Trolls.

58:07.734 --> 58:08.355
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of funny.

58:08.615 --> 58:10.336
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, WonderDog, Harold, and Chat.

58:10.396 --> 58:12.677
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called What Not to Wear is the name of the show.

58:12.998 --> 58:13.978
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called What Not to Wear.

58:14.158 --> 58:15.759
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should check out that show, DarkSakura.

58:15.799 --> 58:16.640
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that on TV?

58:16.660 --> 58:17.701
[SPEAKER_02]: That requires watching television.

58:17.741 --> 58:18.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that on style?

58:18.901 --> 58:19.402
[SPEAKER_06]: Use a torrent.

58:19.522 --> 58:19.822
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

58:20.302 --> 58:21.503
[SPEAKER_06]: That's on Style Network.

58:21.683 --> 58:22.183
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

58:22.263 --> 58:22.924
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do I know this?

58:22.944 --> 58:23.844
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have that.

58:23.864 --> 58:25.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Because your wife probably watches it.

58:26.926 --> 58:29.128
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally sounds like something your wife probably watches.

58:29.808 --> 58:30.068
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

58:30.809 --> 58:31.069
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

58:33.335 --> 58:37.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Just trying to get caught up on some other chatroom comments here.

58:39.885 --> 58:46.134
[SPEAKER_06]: Saikun says, stop using us, Rob, because I guess I'm using the chatroom to do research tonight.

58:48.055 --> 58:49.715
[SPEAKER_06]: Video Game Addiction could possibly be a new diagnosis.

59:15.522 --> 59:18.623
[SPEAKER_06]: This is somewhat a bit of a follow-up to the article we were talking about last week.

59:19.264 --> 59:34.611
[SPEAKER_06]: The AMA is going to be having this meeting, and it already started in Chicago, and the council is going to be asking the group to lobby for the disorder to be included in a widely used mental illness manual created and published by the American Psychiatric Association, Video Game Addiction.

59:34.971 --> 59:40.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if this were actually happening, this could mean that possibly your insurance company

59:40.413 --> 59:44.234
[SPEAKER_06]: would cover this as any other type of mental disorder like alcoholism.

01:00:10.579 --> 01:00:12.619
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ask me how I know so much about insurance, but I do.

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:19.261
[SPEAKER_06]: Insurance companies don't cover marijuana because it's not a federally recognized drug.

01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:21.201
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only recognized in certain states.

01:00:21.541 --> 01:00:24.482
[SPEAKER_06]: So your insurance company typically won't cover marijuana.

01:00:24.842 --> 01:00:26.362
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can get a prescription for it.

01:00:26.402 --> 01:00:27.722
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, in certain states.

01:00:27.882 --> 01:00:30.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and there's only certain farms that are allowed to grow it.

01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:34.523
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, how did we get from video game diagnosis story to pot growing?

01:00:34.883 --> 01:00:37.144
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we give our listeners what they want to know.

01:00:37.284 --> 01:00:37.564
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

01:00:39.139 --> 01:00:42.182
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, from the story here, I want to point this out.

01:00:42.342 --> 01:00:48.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Joyce Protopapas of Frisco, Texas said her 17-year-old son, Michael, was a video game addict.

01:00:48.327 --> 01:00:49.928
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, the story says a video addict.

01:00:50.568 --> 01:01:03.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Over nearly two years, video and internet games transformed him from an outgoing, academically gifted team into a reclusive manipulator who flunked two 10th grade classes and spent several hours a day and night playing a popular online video game called World of Warcraft.

01:01:04.013 --> 01:01:08.537
[SPEAKER_06]: My father was an alcoholic and I saw exactly the same thing in Michael, said Protopappas.

01:01:08.977 --> 01:01:11.139
[SPEAKER_06]: We battled him until October of last year.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:12.400
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to therapists.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.701
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried taking the game away.

01:01:14.021 --> 01:01:15.182
[SPEAKER_06]: He would threaten us physically.

01:01:15.262 --> 01:01:17.284
[SPEAKER_06]: He would curse and call us every name imaginable.

01:01:17.344 --> 01:01:18.625
[SPEAKER_06]: It was as if he was possessed.

01:01:19.295 --> 01:01:23.418
[SPEAKER_06]: and when she suggested the therapist that Michael had a video game addiction nobody was familiar with it.

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:24.318
[SPEAKER_06]: They all poo-pooed it.

01:01:25.019 --> 01:01:33.625
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally they found a therapist and they sent Michael to a therapeutic boarding school $5,000 a month that the insurance didn't cover to get him kicked off the video games.

01:01:33.865 --> 01:01:36.967
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what my mom would have done if I flunked a class over video games?

01:01:37.367 --> 01:01:46.353
[SPEAKER_06]: She would have like thrown the TV out a window or she would have taken she actually did this once she took the power cord to the Nintendo so I couldn't hook it up to the TV for like

01:01:47.205 --> 01:01:49.106
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm powerless to do anything about these video games

01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:17.152
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking bullshit is what it is.

01:02:17.452 --> 01:02:21.975
[SPEAKER_07]: She needs to get off her fucking drunken ass and take care of her damn kids is what she needs to do.

01:02:22.595 --> 01:02:24.136
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I don't know.

01:02:24.216 --> 01:02:27.398
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's stupid that she couldn't just take away the game system.

01:02:27.438 --> 01:02:28.818
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he's a 14-year-old.

01:02:29.239 --> 01:02:30.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Beat the crap out of him.

01:02:30.579 --> 01:02:31.560
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's easy.

01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:39.704
[SPEAKER_06]: If she can't do it... I don't know if I would go that far, but... She should put him in one of those deprivation tanks.

01:02:39.764 --> 01:02:44.647
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like he had a lot of problems besides just video games and maybe he should have gone to the boarding school already.

01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:45.899
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.880
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you, Rob.

01:02:48.461 --> 01:02:53.763
[SPEAKER_07]: Once again, you know, other problems, and then because he's playing video games, obviously the video games are the problem.

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:55.324
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking hate people.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:55.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

01:02:56.084 --> 01:02:58.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Jamie say she agreed with me?

01:02:59.795 --> 01:03:01.537
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob

01:03:25.293 --> 01:03:27.900
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, all of our Eddie Izzard fans, I bought jammy Dodgers.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.686
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you Dodger that jammy when I shove it up your ass?

01:03:31.428 --> 01:03:34.315
[SPEAKER_02]: Then fine, you don't get any of the stuff I bought for Part B.

01:03:35.487 --> 01:03:39.831
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I want the stuff you brought from Part B. I know, the stuff I brought from Part B is great.

01:03:39.971 --> 01:03:45.316
[SPEAKER_06]: So, some news comes from apparently a... Oh wait, I'm sorry, can I read chat comments?

01:03:45.576 --> 01:03:48.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was ignoring the chat and that was a big story, so I'm sorry.

01:03:48.739 --> 01:03:51.381
[SPEAKER_06]: I was too busy fighting with Jamie, I hope you all will understand.

01:03:52.682 --> 01:03:58.227
[SPEAKER_06]: RawSteelUT says, it's a symptom of a larger problem that is ignored because the video games are a scapegoat.

01:03:58.908 --> 01:04:01.530
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good word for what's going on there, scapegoat.

01:04:03.217 --> 01:04:09.262
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold Banjo says, I have so much video game systems and stuff that I always have stuff to do when my parents take away something.

01:04:10.363 --> 01:04:13.425
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe they need to lock you in a room with fluffy walls then.

01:04:13.465 --> 01:04:13.785
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:04:14.386 --> 01:04:16.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Blaze says, I don't buy this addiction thing.

01:04:16.288 --> 01:04:19.510
[SPEAKER_06]: Those types of doctors are the same that buy into the whole truth serum thing.

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:20.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Yikes.

01:04:21.332 --> 01:04:21.532
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:04:21.612 --> 01:04:21.792
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

01:04:23.636 --> 01:04:35.254
[SPEAKER_07]: So, apparently, it was coming from a GameSpot forum poster that said they took part in a recent survey about an unannounced PlayStation Network episodic game called 9 to 5.

01:04:37.021 --> 01:04:47.047
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently the game is supposed to be kind of like an interactive sitcom where you're basically kissing the boss's butt to avoid being fired.

01:04:47.627 --> 01:04:51.590
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, all sorts of weird stuff like that, kind of like The Office or something.

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:59.755
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, they're saying that it's supposed to have four episodes which introduce you to Megacorp, I guess a...

01:05:00.755 --> 01:05:01.596
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:30.692
[SPEAKER_07]: Written and I guess voice acted by people that have been on Comedy Central, Saturday Night Live, Daily Show, Chappelle's Show, Conan O'Brien, etc.

01:05:32.812 --> 01:05:33.293
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

01:05:33.713 --> 01:05:38.714
[SPEAKER_07]: And the game's supposed to run about $5 for an episode or $14 for all four.

01:05:39.474 --> 01:05:42.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonder Dog Harold says 9 to 5 should be based on the movie.

01:05:43.615 --> 01:05:44.375
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yes!

01:05:46.296 --> 01:05:47.016
[SPEAKER_06]: Dolly Parton!

01:05:47.436 --> 01:05:48.136
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah!

01:05:49.562 --> 01:05:50.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Working 9 to 5.

01:05:52.064 --> 01:05:54.866
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost watched that the other night because I was feeling a little gay.

01:05:54.926 --> 01:05:56.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is Pride weekend after all.

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:59.409
[SPEAKER_06]: So I felt like I had to do something really gay this weekend.

01:05:59.429 --> 01:06:02.010
[SPEAKER_06]: So I almost watched 9 to 5 last night.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.671
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I opted to go to bed instead.

01:06:04.252 --> 01:06:10.876
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do any Pride festivities this weekend because I'm not into that whole parade and running around shirtless thing.

01:06:11.076 --> 01:06:11.556
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

01:06:12.037 --> 01:06:12.497
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my thing.

01:06:13.518 --> 01:06:16.840
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's go on to the next story.

01:06:18.297 --> 01:06:19.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Next story.

01:06:19.538 --> 01:06:28.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for all of us who are fans of Hudson Soft, Rising Star Games has a deal to bring seven titles to Europe.

01:06:29.603 --> 01:06:36.086
[SPEAKER_02]: This is taking place between September and March 2008 for PSPDS and Wii.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:41.789
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not really a list of what those are, except for possibly Harvest Moon and Rainbow Islands.

01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:44.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Bomberman!

01:06:46.399 --> 01:06:53.662
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so, hooray, another Harvest Moon game on the Wii.

01:06:53.682 --> 01:06:54.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that really a surprise to anybody?

01:06:56.283 --> 01:06:56.543
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

01:06:57.164 --> 01:06:58.024
[SPEAKER_07]: Chirp, chirp, chirp.

01:06:58.104 --> 01:07:06.367
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, there's like two more Harvest Moon games coming out this summer on PSP and DS.

01:07:07.568 --> 01:07:09.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Shock and awe, I'm so surprised.

01:07:09.028 --> 01:07:10.669
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what, they're all the same!

01:07:10.809 --> 01:07:12.770
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're still not as good as Animal Crossing.

01:07:14.807 --> 01:07:16.989
[SPEAKER_07]: All the fucking same, and you people still buy them.

01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:46.137
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's going on here is that Sony, who is the director of PlayStation Network Operations, Eric Lempel, said that the PlayStation Network may not always be free.

01:07:46.877 --> 01:07:54.300
[SPEAKER_06]: He said basically that the PlayStation Network's only real difference over Xbox Live is the price, which, you know, interesting.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.882
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, of course, then this other exec kind of stepped in and then said, well, it may not always be free.

01:07:58.962 --> 01:08:00.082
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of interesting.

01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:29.789
[SPEAKER_06]: and I wouldn't say that's the only difference between the two well yeah that and the Xbox Live Marketplace has a lot of content whereas the PlayStation Network as I understand it has very little content now granted PlayStation Network has some very good content like that Tekken game good start and you know there's a lot of promising things about some of these originals they're making on PlayStation Network they look a heck of a lot more promising than some of the rehashed stuff we get on Xbox Live but you know is it going to be too little too late that's you know all I worry about so

01:08:32.112 --> 01:08:36.174
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of something a little too late, Dead or Alive the movie.

01:08:37.215 --> 01:08:39.376
[SPEAKER_07]: Delayed forever and then finally came out.

01:08:40.096 --> 01:08:41.157
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did it do?

01:08:41.537 --> 01:08:42.718
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it sucked.

01:08:43.538 --> 01:08:47.821
[SPEAKER_07]: It stinks, as Jay would say from the critic.

01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:55.345
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently opened on 505 screens across the country and pulled in a whopping $232,000 worth.

01:08:58.001 --> 01:08:59.281
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is crappy.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.482
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about $460 per screen.

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:03.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, that's atrocious.

01:09:03.842 --> 01:09:06.583
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like what movies at discount theaters make.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:10.004
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when a movie is almost on video, what it's supposed to make.

01:09:10.124 --> 01:09:12.164
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really bad.

01:09:12.464 --> 01:09:13.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that because piracy ruined it?

01:09:14.244 --> 01:09:18.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that because... I never saw a single ad for this game outside of the internet anywhere.

01:09:19.266 --> 01:09:20.546
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just lack of promotion?

01:09:20.766 --> 01:09:25.907
[SPEAKER_07]: Lack of promotion, but it also opened up against... What the hell did it open up against?

01:09:26.454 --> 01:09:28.315
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that was a lot better than it was

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:43.246
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want to see it.

01:09:43.266 --> 01:09:43.466
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:01.457
[SPEAKER_06]: RawSteelUT says, Sky, it's because it sucked.

01:10:01.977 --> 01:10:04.539
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what Sycoon says too, it's because it fucking sucked.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.283
[SPEAKER_06]: The AfroGuy said, why isn't the Dead or Alive movie on DVD?

01:10:09.463 --> 01:10:11.825
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why didn't it go straight to DVD?

01:10:12.385 --> 01:10:13.186
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question.

01:10:13.586 --> 01:10:19.271
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I don't know, you used to do, before you were doing games distribution, you did movie distribution, so any insight on that?

01:10:19.311 --> 01:10:21.512
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of movies tend to go directly to DVD?

01:10:23.634 --> 01:10:23.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

01:10:25.194 --> 01:10:27.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides the Disney sequels like Cinderella 3.

01:10:28.496 --> 01:10:30.958
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of Disney sequels that go straight to DVD.

01:10:31.639 --> 01:10:37.322
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually movies that they don't want to spend money on advertising because it costs a lot of money to advertise a movie.

01:10:37.402 --> 01:10:42.546
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they feel it's not going to do that well in theaters, they'll release it straight to DVD.

01:10:43.547 --> 01:10:44.587
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's a whole set of...

01:10:47.967 --> 01:10:48.347
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Gobots!

01:11:09.799 --> 01:11:12.882
[SPEAKER_07]: and also they have, was it Snakes on a Train?

01:11:13.282 --> 01:11:13.763
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff like that.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:14.904
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of that goes through.

01:11:14.924 --> 01:11:16.965
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Cheese just said that, Snakes on a Train.

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:17.386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:11:17.986 --> 01:11:22.570
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, what was that movie we all watched, Cheerleading Ninjas or whatever that was?

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:23.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheerleader Ninjas.

01:11:23.351 --> 01:11:24.412
[SPEAKER_06]: That movie was incredible.

01:11:24.452 --> 01:11:26.073
[SPEAKER_07]: That was not.

01:11:27.114 --> 01:11:28.255
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some good ones, though.

01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:29.997
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got some good ones that are coming out.

01:11:31.017 --> 01:11:33.520
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Dead Clowns about zombie clowns?

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.581
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be cool.

01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:37.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, is it Clowns from Outer Space?

01:11:37.864 --> 01:11:39.846
[SPEAKER_07]: Killer Clowns from Outer Space, that's going to be awesome.

01:11:40.246 --> 01:11:42.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that already came out years ago, and it sucked.

01:11:42.508 --> 01:11:43.448
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, and it was awesome.

01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:45.990
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to have a whole clown horror night.

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:52.636
[SPEAKER_06]: People are raving about the DVD sequels in chat, even though this isn't game-related.

01:11:53.056 --> 01:11:53.957
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it is a little bit.

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:57.039
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, I mean, really, Bambi 2, WTF?

01:11:57.059 --> 01:11:59.441
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, what the hell, Bambi 2?

01:12:00.022 --> 01:12:01.943
[SPEAKER_06]: Bambi 2, my mom is still dead.

01:12:02.023 --> 01:12:05.346
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Bambi 2, Bambi was grown up, and it's his kids now, so...

01:12:06.414 --> 01:12:07.254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that makes it okay.

01:12:07.314 --> 01:12:08.315
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big Disney cop-out.

01:12:08.815 --> 01:12:15.098
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the only Bambi 2 I was ever interested in was there was Godzilla vs. Bambi, and then Godzilla vs. Bambi 2, Bambi's Revenge.

01:12:18.279 --> 01:12:20.460
[SPEAKER_02]: Godzilla vs. Bambi was just... Alone in the Dark 2.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.742
[SPEAKER_06]: The Afro guy says, isn't there a Lion King 4?

01:12:24.222 --> 01:12:29.204
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's a Lion King 4, but if I remember right, there was a Lion King, like, two and a half.

01:12:29.685 --> 01:12:30.225
[SPEAKER_06]: One and a half.

01:12:30.845 --> 01:12:34.947
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of these movies, I don't know if it was one and a half or Lion King 3, one of these movies was...

01:12:36.108 --> 01:12:37.309
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

01:13:01.119 --> 01:13:03.141
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there's a lot that goes straight to DVD.

01:13:03.442 --> 01:13:05.283
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just look at your video store.

01:13:05.323 --> 01:13:07.165
[SPEAKER_07]: So why not Dead or Alive?

01:13:07.205 --> 01:13:08.767
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a prime candidate to go straight to DVD.

01:13:08.787 --> 01:13:15.053
[SPEAKER_07]: It was supposed to go straight to DVD at one time, but they decided, hey, we're going to release it to the theaters because people are going to go see it.

01:13:15.703 --> 01:13:16.484
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, were they wrong.

01:13:16.824 --> 01:13:19.546
[SPEAKER_06]: But how much money does it cost to put a movie in theaters?

01:13:19.906 --> 01:13:22.728
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they didn't spend any money on promotion, did they really lose anything?

01:13:23.348 --> 01:13:23.948
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a whole lot.

01:13:23.989 --> 01:13:25.089
[SPEAKER_07]: They probably wouldn't lose anything.

01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:30.073
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually probably would help the film a little bit, especially if they leave it in there long enough to do a few million dollars.

01:13:30.193 --> 01:13:32.234
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they'll be able to get that one critic.

01:13:32.254 --> 01:13:36.517
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the thing about putting your movie in theaters is that the critics will review it.

01:13:37.077 --> 01:13:45.845
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll get that one critic who will give the movie an amazing review just because he wants to have his name in all the papers and the advertisement.

01:13:46.246 --> 01:13:51.070
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Dead or Alive is a, what's a quote you could say?

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:52.451
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy action thriller!

01:13:52.572 --> 01:13:57.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead or Alive is a very tantalizing action movie, you know?

01:13:58.697 --> 01:13:59.258
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sucks.

01:13:59.318 --> 01:14:01.640
[SPEAKER_06]: But they wouldn't say that, you know, they'd leave that part out.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dot dot dot.

01:14:04.329 --> 01:14:19.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy Action If you were to call this movie Great and Awesome you would be horribly wrong Great and Awesome DJ Morpheus in chat room makes a local joke Those of you folks from Sacramento will love this joke And it's always Mark S. Allen

01:14:23.969 --> 01:14:30.654
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw says there's a Starship Troopers 3 in the works that's going straight to video and Casper Van Dien is reprising the role he did in the first movie.

01:14:30.974 --> 01:14:33.576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because Casper Van Dien hasn't really done anything in the series.

01:14:33.596 --> 01:14:35.077
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he has done a lot of things.

01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:35.357
[SPEAKER_07]: Has he?

01:14:35.377 --> 01:14:36.598
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all straight to DVD.

01:14:37.078 --> 01:14:38.739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a heck of a career.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.963
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people that, that's how you know they've kind of lost it.

01:14:44.783 --> 01:14:49.066
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Jean-Claude Van Damme and fucking Steven Seagal, man?

01:14:49.086 --> 01:14:50.227
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still making stuff.

01:14:51.067 --> 01:14:51.767
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of things.

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.788
[SPEAKER_07]: People actually buy that shit up.

01:14:54.008 --> 01:14:56.609
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing with Chuck Norris, dude.

01:14:56.649 --> 01:14:57.829
[SPEAKER_07]: Chuck Norris hasn't made too much.

01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:02.111
[SPEAKER_07]: I still say they need to do Chuck Norris versus the world, you know, because I would say that.

01:15:02.271 --> 01:15:04.992
[SPEAKER_07]: I say Freddy versus Jason versus Walker, Texas Ranger.

01:15:05.472 --> 01:15:06.012
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?

01:15:07.673 --> 01:15:10.494
[SPEAKER_07]: Chuck Norris versus Michael Myers.

01:15:11.855 --> 01:15:12.855
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we're crazy.

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:15.116
[SPEAKER_07]: Versus the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:15.616
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're crazy.

01:15:16.198 --> 01:15:16.918
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway.

01:15:17.298 --> 01:15:23.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody also made a point much earlier, and I apologize because your comment scrolled way off the screen, but somebody said, porn goes direct to DVD.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:23.960
[SPEAKER_06]: All of it.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:24.860
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.160
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.701
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really keep tabs of the porno theaters around here.

01:15:28.721 --> 01:15:30.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, theaters weren't really what they used to be for porn.

01:15:31.721 --> 01:15:32.301
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know what I mean.

01:15:34.102 --> 01:15:37.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew Nami would like to point out that Orange Lounge is not Baron's chat.

01:15:38.142 --> 01:15:39.223
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a World of Warcraft joke.

01:15:40.183 --> 01:15:41.143
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, alright.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:43.604
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're going to bring this segment to a close here.

01:15:43.624 --> 01:15:45.004
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to finish off Part A here.

01:15:45.344 --> 01:15:45.724
[SPEAKER_06]: However...

01:15:46.607 --> 01:15:51.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Part B is coming up, and we're actually going to put the news away tonight for Part B. We're all done with the news.

01:15:52.413 --> 01:15:55.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I should ask real quick, Loki, do you have any last-minute things you want to add?

01:15:55.957 --> 01:15:56.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know you had a few stories.

01:15:57.378 --> 01:15:57.778
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

01:15:58.419 --> 01:15:59.040
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, go ahead.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:15:59.320
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

01:15:59.775 --> 01:16:01.056
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:16:19.714 --> 01:16:31.401
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that have listened every week, that have stuck with Orange Lounge Radio for the past five years, and really helped make this show what it is, and quite honestly, given us the motivation to continue to do this show.

01:16:31.882 --> 01:16:38.686
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never really been about the number of people that are listening, because to put it in perspective, we don't talk about the number of people we have listen to our show very often.

01:16:39.346 --> 01:16:41.287
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that's private information.

01:16:41.728 --> 01:16:44.209
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our business, and we don't really need to brag.

01:16:44.489 --> 01:16:48.332
[SPEAKER_06]: But for real, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio had...

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:49.332
[SPEAKER_06]: And I couldn't.

01:17:01.438 --> 01:17:01.938
[SPEAKER_02]: and I couldn't.

01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:03.159
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, because you were in a weird place.

01:17:03.179 --> 01:17:05.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was in direct competition at the time of DDR Freak Radio.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:18.484
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can admit now, five years later, that a whole lot of this, this is the weirdest thing happened here is that Iguana Girl and I used to be BFF, but then we had like a major falling out and Iguana Girl and I didn't speak for like three years.

01:17:18.524 --> 01:17:19.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, it was pretty dirty.

01:17:20.405 --> 01:17:21.928
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:17:33.624 --> 01:17:34.865
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a peace treaty signature.

01:17:35.045 --> 01:17:42.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, but the weirdest thing happened is that DDR Freak Radio started, like, and Orange Lounge Radio, like, both of us had the plans to do an online radio station.

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:43.632
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say anything.

01:17:43.832 --> 01:17:46.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and nobody, neither one of us kind of knew what the other was doing.

01:17:46.354 --> 01:17:47.094
And I knew on both ends.

01:17:47.775 --> 01:17:49.176
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was just kind of weird the way that happened.

01:17:49.496 --> 01:17:51.057
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, why did we bring that up?

01:17:51.097 --> 01:17:58.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, because we, I tried to promote a lot on DDR Freak and some of the other, I can't remember if Bomani Style even existed at the time, but some of the other DDR sites.

01:17:58.283 --> 01:17:59.003
[SPEAKER_01]: Bomani Style was around.

01:17:59.023 --> 01:17:59.384
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they?

01:17:59.404 --> 01:17:59.544
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:18:00.214 --> 01:18:04.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the other sites that were around at that time, we tried to promote the show, and we had a whopping 15 listeners for the first episode.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:15.700
[SPEAKER_06]: And pretty much, honestly, guys, for about the first three years of Orange Lingerie, for about the first three years of Orange Lingerie, I would say we were lucky if we pulled 40 listeners in the third year.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.041
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just the way live radio is, boys and girls.

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:24.143
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of folks don't – live through CC5 kind of limits us a little bit, and the fact that it's live –

01:18:25.578 --> 01:18:29.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other people have better things to do Sunday night, which is understandable.

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:33.803
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, podcasting, audio blogging, whatever you want to call it, it really opened doors for us.

01:18:34.223 --> 01:18:41.568
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we were really fortunate to jump on that train before it really took off when iTunes incorporated podcasting in June of 2005.

01:18:42.248 --> 01:18:44.170
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was just really awesome for us.

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:48.072
[SPEAKER_06]: And now our listenership is, I can say it's in the thousands.

01:18:48.352 --> 01:18:50.253
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not talking like 9,000, more like 2,000 or 3,000 people that we have.

01:18:50.273 --> 01:18:51.174
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the 4,000 a week.

01:18:55.074 --> 01:18:56.995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, but, you know, it doesn't... You know, whatever.

01:18:57.255 --> 01:19:01.256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just interesting that it's blown up so much thanks to this podcasting thing.

01:19:01.576 --> 01:19:03.697
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me, really, not a lot's changed.

01:19:03.777 --> 01:19:07.958
[SPEAKER_06]: The motivation continues to be... Because we don't hear from all 4,000 of you.

01:19:08.018 --> 01:19:11.019
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate the fact that you guys are listening to the show.

01:19:11.219 --> 01:19:12.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear God, not all 4,000 people email me.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.600
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate that you're listening.

01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.280
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should.

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.741
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we don't... We can check the email.

01:19:16.781 --> 01:19:17.161
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?

01:19:17.341 --> 01:19:18.221
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me say this, too.

01:19:18.281 --> 01:19:20.482
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to try to wrap this up because I don't want... But...

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:23.511
[SPEAKER_06]: We speculate we have about 1,800 real actual people subscribing to the show.

01:19:23.531 --> 01:19:24.432
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, that's regardless.

01:19:36.728 --> 01:19:39.370
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we don't hear from all those people on a real regular basis.

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:40.311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the chatters.

01:19:40.451 --> 01:19:41.292
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the callers.

01:19:41.472 --> 01:19:43.753
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the folks that send us emails.

01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:47.776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the people that reach out that really have kind of given us that motivation to keep going for the past five years.

01:19:47.796 --> 01:19:48.597
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's how I feel.

01:19:48.677 --> 01:19:51.479
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about you guys, but that's really been what it is.

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I personally want to dedicate our success to the powers of the underworld.

01:20:00.345 --> 01:20:02.347
[SPEAKER_06]: And that demonic pact you signed one day?

01:20:03.127 --> 01:20:05.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they offended me, my soul.

01:20:07.448 --> 01:20:08.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, anything you want to add?

01:20:08.509 --> 01:20:08.809
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:11.270
[SPEAKER_06]: What keeps you motivated week after week to do this program?

01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:13.031
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm motivated.

01:20:14.191 --> 01:20:14.671
[SPEAKER_06]: You're an asshole.

01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:15.372
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm motivated.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:19.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on my live journal, it says I'm motivated by spite and porn.

01:20:20.314 --> 01:20:23.435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm motivated by my non-video game addiction.

01:20:23.996 --> 01:20:25.077
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like turns!

01:20:25.117 --> 01:20:25.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad.

01:20:53.101 --> 01:20:55.403
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be back, and who knows what could happen.

01:20:55.443 --> 01:20:58.165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a very interesting Part B on this, our five-year anniversary.

01:20:58.205 --> 01:21:01.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to and supporting Independent Radio.

01:21:01.847 --> 01:21:03.788
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome, and you're the reason we're here.

01:21:04.089 --> 01:21:05.350
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back after this with more.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:11.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:21:11.654 --> 01:21:15.957
