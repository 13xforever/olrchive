WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.440
Today, June 24th, 2007, our introduction takes a little trip down memory lane.

00:19.440 --> 00:30.400
Hey, where are we going?

00:30.400 --> 00:59.360
The Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

00:59.360 --> 01:11.600
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

01:11.600 --> 01:22.480
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things

01:22.480 --> 01:29.760
that are evil.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.640
So you probably shouldn't let your children listen.

01:32.640 --> 01:37.200
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
demons from hell.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
Oh, wait.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.200
Most children already are evil little demons from hell.

01:40.200 --> 01:49.840
Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.880
In fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.560
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

01:56.560 --> 02:01.120
Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.120
Samburgers!

02:02.120 --> 02:04.480
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

02:04.480 --> 02:05.480
That was huge.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.480
Cool.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.480
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

02:10.480 --> 02:11.480
Yeah, that's right.

02:11.480 --> 02:15.480
The only thing you're going to be riding is me.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.480
Have you seen Malcolm?

02:17.480 --> 02:18.480
Lena?

02:18.480 --> 02:21.600
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.600
So it was you.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.840
I was going to expose you.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.840
I know.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.480
So I choose to expose myself.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.800
Please, there are ladies present.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.480
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.480
Dark Sakura.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.640
Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

02:35.640 --> 02:36.640
Sky.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.640
Anytime, anyplace, baby.

02:37.640 --> 02:38.640
Loki.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.640
Ow, my foot!

02:39.640 --> 02:42.800
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

02:42.800 --> 02:46.680
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46.680 --> 02:53.120
We are live on this June the 24th of 2007.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.240
Good god that was a bloated ass intro.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.480
That was actually, that was one of our old intros.

02:58.480 --> 03:00.600
That intro's like two minutes long.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.320
Go figure.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.040
We actually used that for like a year.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.960
Anyway, hi and welcome to that show dedicated not just to Bomani now but after several years

03:10.960 --> 03:16.120
on the air we evolved to talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gaming lifestyle.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.520
My name is Rob Roberts.

03:17.520 --> 03:22.040
Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.040
Hi.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.880
Five years, and that's all you have to say is, ah.

03:27.880 --> 03:28.880
Hi.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.520
That's how I'd sum it up too, really.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.920
And also say hello, as always, to Tech Master Loki.

03:33.920 --> 03:34.920
Hello.

03:34.920 --> 03:35.920
How you doing, Loki?

03:35.920 --> 03:36.920
I'm doing fine.

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
All right.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.920
Sounds good.

03:38.920 --> 03:39.920
Well, there you have it.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.200
It's just the three of us tonight because tonight is a special night.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.600
It is our fifth anniversary show, and hello to those of you in our chat room, the always

03:46.600 --> 03:52.920
present fourth guest in our program, chat.orangelaungerator.com, the biggest our chat room has ever been.

03:52.920 --> 03:57.200
Thank you guys so much, and a big thank you to allgames.com as well, who's simulcasting

03:57.200 --> 04:01.720
our live broadcast tonight to accommodate everybody that wanted to listen to us live.

04:01.720 --> 04:02.960
That's so awesome.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.720
Anyway, here we are all these years later, and we're still talking about the latest and

04:07.720 --> 04:11.880
what's going on in the news and gaming culture, but most importantly, us.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.800
We start the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, so let's kick it over

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
to Dark Sakura.

04:16.800 --> 04:17.800
How was your gaming week?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.480
I played World of Warcraft.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
You were there.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.840
I was there.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.480
And then I signed off to go talk to people because I like living.

04:25.480 --> 04:28.120
Wait, you mean you signed off for real life?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.120
Sort of.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.120
That's no fun.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.120
I've been working overtime all week, so.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.120
Ew, that's no fun at all.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.120
Money is good.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.120
Money is good.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.120
Yeah.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.120
Appreciate that.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.120
All right.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.920
Say hello as well to Loki, and how was your gaming week?

04:38.920 --> 04:43.200
I played a bunch of things, actually.

04:43.200 --> 04:50.780
I tried WTF, or Work Time Fun, I guess, for the PSB.

04:50.780 --> 04:51.920
It's pretty awesome.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.920
It's a little weird.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.640
A lot of the games are very mundane.

04:54.640 --> 04:59.680
It's just working, like one of them that you put caps on pens.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.800
That's it.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.240
There's another one that's pretty funny, though, where you are a drunken mayor and you have

05:04.240 --> 05:08.440
to stumble your way over to a ribbon to cut it.

05:08.440 --> 05:16.680
So you basically earn money to use in these little gumball vending machines to get little

05:16.680 --> 05:19.960
trinkets and useless crap.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.260
And that's the whole game.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.600
So that's kind of interesting.

05:23.600 --> 05:30.220
The other game I played this week was Hot Pixel for the PSP, thanks to somebody leaking

05:30.220 --> 05:32.600
it on the internet.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.120
And thank God they leaked it on the internet, because I would not have wanted to buy this

05:36.120 --> 05:37.120
game.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.200
It was horrible.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.760
It's short, for one.

05:40.760 --> 05:45.560
I mean, I beat the game under an hour, so that's pretty bad.

05:45.560 --> 05:50.720
The second thing is, the guy behind it, this French guy who does this podcast, I believe

05:50.720 --> 05:57.440
it's called Street Smart Cool Cat, he's a fucking retard.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.600
I fucking hate him.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.440
I hate him even more after playing this game.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.800
He is a complete douche.

06:02.800 --> 06:08.840
He is, like, the beginning of each level that you play, he's doing something stupid to make

06:08.840 --> 06:12.220
himself look really cool, and he's not.

06:12.220 --> 06:16.740
He's like a cross between fucking Bill Nye the Science Guy and Screech, except not smart

06:16.740 --> 06:19.960
and nerdier.

06:19.960 --> 06:24.800
Then I also played, let's see, Transformers, the game on the PSP.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.920
Thank God I'm not buying the PSP one, although I will be playing the 361 later this week.

06:29.920 --> 06:34.160
I just wanted to see what the PSP one looked like, and it's not very good.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.600
But if you only have a PSP, then, I don't know, maybe it's worth picking up.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.760
Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, I actually played some of the single player part of that,

06:42.760 --> 06:44.160
so that was kind of interesting.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.760
Pretty good storyline so far.

06:45.760 --> 06:50.520
Of course, multiplayer in Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, and, let's see, off of

06:50.520 --> 06:54.880
the PSP, I also played Zelda 2, the Adventures of Link.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.880
Still hate that game, but I'm still playing it.

06:57.880 --> 07:04.600
Earth Defense Force 2, I actually tried that on the PlayStation 2.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.600
It's interesting.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.920
I don't like the controls too much.

07:06.920 --> 07:10.760
I'm not sure if there's a way to configure it so it's exactly like the Xbox 360, because

07:10.760 --> 07:14.840
I think that would really help, because right now, the way they have it set up, your look

07:14.840 --> 07:19.320
and movement are the same analog six, so that kind of sucks.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.600
But otherwise, it looks pretty cool.

07:20.600 --> 07:25.040
You get the Destroy Big Ben in the first level.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.040
Let's see, what else?

07:26.040 --> 07:30.200
Oh, I also played, of course, more Earth Defense Force 2017.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.480
Finished the game on hard now, and now we're going through hardest and Inferno.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.280
It's about time you beat that damn game, because I swear, for like the past ten weeks I've

07:37.280 --> 07:42.680
beat the game on easy, normal, and now hard.

07:42.680 --> 07:46.820
It's just I have to play through it all the time until we get the genocide gun.

07:46.820 --> 07:49.240
Is this something about trying to get all 1000 achievement points?

07:49.240 --> 07:52.320
Well, I just want the genocide gun, and unfortunately I have to beat the whole game.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.920
The genocide gun.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.560
Does a million damage per shot, and blows up everything.

07:59.560 --> 08:04.040
And then, yeah, that's actually I think about it for the week.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.840
All right, well you've got a lot of playing done.

08:06.840 --> 08:10.400
I had a pretty mellow gaming week, kind of like Dark Sakura.

08:10.400 --> 08:15.360
I pretty much spent all my time on World of Warcraft, because I'm a sad, sad little addict,

08:15.360 --> 08:18.560
but I reached a real milestone in World of Warcraft this week.

08:18.560 --> 08:24.440
I hit level 60 today, hooray, which now is kind of dwarfed by the fact that you can actually

08:24.440 --> 08:28.960
go to 70 in Burning Crusade, so I'm just waiting for the people in chat to go, I'm level 70.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.240
But I still think 60 is kind of a bit of a landmark, and just goes to show you what a

08:32.240 --> 08:34.080
sad little addict I really am.

08:34.080 --> 08:39.180
But our guild is really growing on there, and it's been a lot of fun, and we have Ventrilo

08:39.180 --> 08:43.320
and all that fun stuff, so it's a fun time waster.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.600
Other than that, not a whole lot.

08:45.600 --> 08:50.240
I checked out the new Xbox Live Arcade titled the Band of Bugs game, did you check that

08:50.240 --> 08:51.240
out at all?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.240
No.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.640
I know usually you check out the arcade releases.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.360
It's kind of like a Final Fantasy Tactics-ish game, it's your tactical type of game.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.760
That I definitely won't be playing it.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.640
Yeah, I know, it's not really, well I don't know, because I really dug Final Fantasy Tactics,

09:02.640 --> 09:05.960
but I didn't play enough of Band of Bugs to give it a fair review, I didn't even purchase

09:05.960 --> 09:10.880
the retail one, but I did check it out, and it was a little bit of my gaming week, and

09:10.880 --> 09:14.120
I was like, oh, I don't know if I could, it was kind of one of those things where I'm

09:14.120 --> 09:18.400
playing so much freaking WoW that I don't really have time for another tactical game.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.080
So much for that.

09:20.080 --> 09:26.040
However, I did also, I got onto GameTap for some strange reason, I decided, oh, I'm paying

09:26.040 --> 09:29.520
for this, I should probably check it out again, and I just started, I had like a marathon

09:29.520 --> 09:34.040
the other day, I was playing all these old-school Atari 2600 games, like I was playing Kaboom

09:34.040 --> 09:36.640
for like an hour and a half, it was kind of sad.

09:36.640 --> 09:40.240
That's that game, like you remember on the old-school 2600 with the little paddle, except

09:40.240 --> 09:43.800
now you use your mouse and you catch the bombs, like I don't know what it is, like some people

09:43.800 --> 09:46.780
can sit there and play Bejeweled for hours, I was playing Kaboom.

09:46.780 --> 09:50.480
And then I played Pitfall, the old-school Pitfall, and I'm a lot better at it now than

09:50.480 --> 09:52.280
I was when I was seven, go figure.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.640
So I actually played through quite a ways in the game.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.840
And I like how GameTap is really taking a lot of good ideas from Xbox Live and incorporating

09:59.840 --> 10:03.640
into their service, like now you have a profile page that shows the last games that you've

10:03.640 --> 10:06.400
played, and all that stuff, where have I seen this before?

10:06.400 --> 10:11.440
And then you have your leaderboards on the actual service itself, so pretty cool.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.840
You know, hey, if it's a good idea, why not borrow it?

10:14.840 --> 10:17.540
I was going to say rip it off, but I guess it would be borrow it.

10:17.540 --> 10:22.640
So I do like how GameTap's growing, and it'll be interesting when it comes over to the Macs,

10:22.640 --> 10:26.000
and more people that I know have been holding out on GameTap because it's not out on Mac,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.560
will be able to come over.

10:27.560 --> 10:31.600
So that was really it, otherwise a little bit of Puzzle Quest, and that was pretty much

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
it.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
I didn't play a lot of console games this week, funny enough.

10:33.600 --> 10:40.400
I got Season 1 of Sam & Max, I haven't installed it yet though, but I'm planning on playing

10:40.400 --> 10:41.400
it.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.640
I'm just kind of on the fritz right now, something's going out in it, because it randomly shuts

10:46.640 --> 10:51.400
off completely, so I'm thinking either the power supply, hard drive, or motherboard's

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
going out.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.000
Either way, I need to upgrade the damn thing.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.660
It's been like years.

10:56.660 --> 11:01.080
Going to the chat room, the always present, chat.orangemanjr.com, always the fourth guest,

11:01.080 --> 11:03.800
always has been for the past five years, always will be.

11:03.800 --> 11:08.720
We'll start out with this lovely comment tonight, rostielut in chat says, Sky, god, stop sucking

11:08.720 --> 11:11.140
GameTap's cock.

11:11.140 --> 11:15.480
You know, you'd think I'm on their payroll or something, I swear to god I'm not.

11:15.480 --> 11:18.520
I think it's just a pretty good thing.

11:18.520 --> 11:22.080
It's relatively cheap, you get a lot of games, it's not a bad deal.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.200
If I like something, I'm going to tell you I like it.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.400
Talk about Xbox Live all the time, we're not in their payroll.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.400
I do, yeah.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.400
I'm not sucking their cock.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.400
We're not in anybody's payroll, which sucks.

11:29.400 --> 11:33.240
I kind of wish I was getting some nookie from all these people, that would be a lot of fun.

11:33.240 --> 11:36.800
I want them to hire me to rub them while they're naked.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.480
You want to give a little massage loving to GameTap?

11:39.480 --> 11:43.840
Dude, I would love to go to the video game companies and be their massage therapist.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.480
Would you give out some happy endings?

11:45.480 --> 11:47.440
Would you give Reggie a happy ending?

11:47.440 --> 11:50.520
Rob, I don't think that's funny.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.360
Oh, and black boy in the chat room says, Loki should buy a new MacBook.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.040
That's funny, because see, the next computer I'm buying, my benchmark is it's going to

11:59.040 --> 12:01.760
be able to run Crysis very well.

12:01.760 --> 12:08.440
Unfortunately, a MacBook would just explode by, I don't know, even thinking about running

12:08.440 --> 12:09.440
Crysis.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.440
No.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.440
Ah, let's see.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.640
What wasn't so negative that was said in chat here that we could also read?

12:14.640 --> 12:18.560
Hitstun says, I like GameTap so far, but I don't have the disk space or clock speed for

12:18.560 --> 12:20.320
any of the newer stuff.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.320
Fair enough.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.800
I suppose my computer, I replaced my computer about a year and a half ago, so it's a little

12:24.800 --> 12:27.960
bit newer, so it can run some of these more higher end stuff.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.680
And some folks who haven't replaced their computer in a few years are probably struggling

12:31.680 --> 12:32.680
a little more.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.680
I'm in the process of rebuilding.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.960
Well, not necessarily rebuilding, but I'm adding in stuff to the one that was given

12:36.960 --> 12:37.960
to me.

12:37.960 --> 12:38.960
All right.

12:38.960 --> 12:39.960
Cool.

12:39.960 --> 12:47.880
Yeah, I like to build my own computer as opposed to having the whole Dell-in-a-box type thing.

12:47.880 --> 12:53.560
I re-downloaded MAME today, and along with it, of course, the first ROMs I re-downloaded

12:53.560 --> 12:55.400
were all the Gals Panic series.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
Good job.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.220
How about Miss World 96?

12:58.220 --> 13:01.960
I think I might have grabbed that, just because I knew you would laugh.

13:01.960 --> 13:07.280
What I was trying to do was install Guitar Freak's 5th Mix on my laptop to be able to

13:07.280 --> 13:13.360
play with the Guitar Hero controller, unfortunately 5th Mix at the moment I don't think is compatible

13:13.360 --> 13:14.360
with MAME.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.360
I don't know.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.700
They also have 3rd Korean on there, which I thought was kind of funny.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.680
They actually have DDR games playable in MAME?

13:19.680 --> 13:20.680
I never knew that.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.680
Yeah.

13:21.680 --> 13:22.680
It's kind of weird.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.640
I don't think they're playable well, like audio problems, but I don't know.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.400
Have they actually enabled the new Capcom board?

13:29.400 --> 13:33.000
I remember last week we reported Street Fighter 3 and stuff, so that's now in there?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.440
Yes, I think so.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.000
I remember seeing some.

13:37.000 --> 13:45.680
I want to see the Sega boards emulated, because I want Planet Harrier.

13:45.680 --> 13:50.760
You know, I sometimes will go without playing MAME for a long time, and then I go back and

13:50.760 --> 13:53.040
I kind of check on it, and they have all this crazy stuff playable.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
Planet Harrier.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.040
It might be there.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
You should check.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.040
I don't know.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.040
We haven't been able to emulate the board.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.040
Don't.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.040
Does anybody in chat room know if they're ever going to get that?

14:01.040 --> 14:02.040
Who knows?

14:02.040 --> 14:03.040
All right.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.720
Well, that was our gaming week.

14:04.720 --> 14:09.520
Let's get on to some other stuff before we get into the news, like some housekeeping.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.920
We just wanted to say tonight, of course, it's our fifth anniversary show.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.040
Not a whole lot.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.480
I don't know.

14:16.480 --> 14:21.120
I don't know how you guys feel, but I wasn't really all about tooting our own horns tonight.

14:21.120 --> 14:25.840
This is more like fan service for the listeners tonight with the different intro and the fact

14:25.840 --> 14:29.780
that we are dedicating all of Part B tonight to our listeners, so we're going to invite

14:29.780 --> 14:35.640
you guys later on to call in, chat with us, just talk about what's going on in gaming,

14:35.640 --> 14:37.100
and that'll be that.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.480
That's kind of our special plan for the fifth anniversary show.

14:39.480 --> 14:48.680
No A-list celebrities, no surprise major gaming celebrity guests or anything like that, but

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
you never know.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.680
I don't know.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.360
I tried to send email to some people that do other shows and stuff, like, hey, we're

14:53.360 --> 14:54.360
going to be taking calls.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.360
Who knows?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.920
We might get surprises as folks might call in.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.720
That would be pretty rad, so we'll see what happens.

14:59.720 --> 15:05.680
Anyhow, let's get onto the gaming news, because we do it every week.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.040
We do it every other week, so why not?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.120
We'll talk about it this week as well.

15:09.120 --> 15:13.140
Of course, unless you've been living in a cave in the gaming world this week, you probably

15:13.140 --> 15:18.680
have heard about this, but Manhunt 2, controversy, controversy, controversy, okay, God, how do

15:18.680 --> 15:20.680
I sum this all up?

15:20.680 --> 15:24.500
I realize most people have probably read this all online already, so how do I sum this up?

15:24.500 --> 15:31.520
The game was effectively banned in Britain, not so much that they banned it, but basically

15:31.520 --> 15:35.240
they said, we're not going to rate it, and when the game doesn't have a rating, then

15:35.240 --> 15:37.680
you can't sell it.

15:37.680 --> 15:41.520
In a roundabout way, it was banned, if that makes sense.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.680
They're not going to be able to sell this game in Britain.

15:43.680 --> 15:48.040
Then people are saying, oh, well, this game is so horrible.

15:48.040 --> 15:52.880
They should rate it AO in America, and it turns out, oh, the game has been rated AO

15:52.880 --> 15:58.120
here in America, adults only, which is a rating that's been reserved for very, very few games,

15:58.120 --> 16:03.280
lots of very under the radar type of sex games have gotten this type of rating.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.280
All on PC, by the way.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.280
Yeah, they're all PC.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.160
Well, because, and then the next part of this was, if the game has continued to stay rated

16:09.160 --> 16:14.240
AO, the Nintendo will not endorse it, Sony will not endorse it, and Microsoft will not

16:14.240 --> 16:15.240
allow it.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
Which is fucked up.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
They will all not allow the product to come out on the systems.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.240
That's fucked up.

16:18.240 --> 16:21.420
Okay, here's the first place, or here's the first question I'm going to ask, and maybe

16:21.420 --> 16:24.080
somebody's already asked this, I don't know if you know the answer.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.040
What about a Renegade release?

16:26.040 --> 16:29.620
Because I remember back in the day, I remember on Nintendo, like there were companies that

16:29.620 --> 16:34.060
would make games without the official Nintendo seal of equality, like Color Dreams, remember

16:34.060 --> 16:39.120
those like ugly-ass blue cartridges and the really horrible games that came out from them?

16:39.120 --> 16:45.120
Like they could do it, but I'm thinking maybe it's because Take-Two is a big, big publisher,

16:45.120 --> 16:46.320
they don't want to burn their bridges.

16:46.320 --> 16:50.880
Well, not only that, but I mean, they could still release everything Renegade or whatever,

16:50.880 --> 16:55.240
but I think now that they actually do have to get everything licensed in order to be

16:55.240 --> 17:00.120
able to actually press this, that's why everything has to go through certification before it

17:00.120 --> 17:05.800
can actually go gold and get this press on it, so I don't know.

17:05.800 --> 17:11.440
I don't know why they, I wish, the whole thing between AO and mature-retarded anyways, because

17:11.440 --> 17:17.320
what you're saying is this game is not suitable for 17-year-olds, which I don't know, hostile

17:17.320 --> 17:22.360
too out there, it's all about torture and people's limbs getting chopped off and like

17:22.360 --> 17:23.360
rape and stuff.

17:23.360 --> 17:24.360
Naked chicks dancing in blood.

17:24.360 --> 17:30.320
And naked chicks dancing in blood, and that's a suitable for 17-year-olds, but oh, a pixelated

17:30.320 --> 17:36.880
video game, oh okay, well that's way, 17-year-olds go, oh wait, this is teaching me how to commit

17:36.880 --> 17:41.080
murder, okay, I'm going to go murder somebody now, come on, I mean seriously, grow the fuck

17:41.080 --> 17:46.520
up, and they're all, well this is to keep it out of our children's hands.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.600
It's not supposed to be in children's hands, it's fucking 17 and over.

17:50.600 --> 17:55.720
Quick comments from chat room, let's see, Corey 31 says, but no stores will sell it,

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
that's the main problem.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
Oh, but it will.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.600
Like, Sylvara follows up, Walmart, Target, Blockbuster wouldn't sell it.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.640
Who cares, that's a selling point for the independents.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.640
Internet!

18:03.640 --> 18:06.400
No, independent stores would carry that shit, in fact, when they heard that it was going

18:06.400 --> 18:11.480
to be adults only, and that Blockbuster, Gamefly, and Walmart weren't going to be carrying it,

18:11.480 --> 18:15.960
they're like, I'll double my order, you know, so that shit would still sell, it may not

18:15.960 --> 18:19.120
sell as fast, but it would still sell.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.400
Here's a comment from Take Two.

18:21.400 --> 18:26.280
This actually comes from, I'm not sure who at Take Two, this is a general comment from

18:26.280 --> 18:31.640
Take Two, quote, the ESRB has issued an initial rating of AO, adults only, for Manhunt 2.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.760
Oh, this is an actual statement they made.

18:34.760 --> 18:38.440
We believe the process of rating video games is to help people make informed entertainment

18:38.440 --> 18:40.280
choices and not to limit them.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.600
Manhunt 2 is created for mature audiences and we strongly believe it should receive

18:43.600 --> 18:47.880
an M rating, aligning it with similar content created in other forms of media.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.400
We are exploring other options with regards to Manhunt 2.

18:51.400 --> 18:54.680
Yeah, and I do think that they're unfairly being targeted.

18:54.680 --> 19:01.680
It's always, you know, Take Two is always the target of both advocates for like, you

19:01.680 --> 19:05.840
know, family games and stuff like that.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.960
Here's the thing though, I mean, from what I've heard about this game, and granted, I've

19:09.960 --> 19:13.560
never played the original Manhunt, it wasn't really on my radar, I never played it.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.800
Although, I have to admit, when I heard that this game was coming out for the Wii, I was

19:17.800 --> 19:22.080
very interested, because yes, there is a sadistic side of me that thinks it would be kind of

19:22.080 --> 19:26.720
fun to chop people up in many gruesome ways with the Wiimote and the nunchuck.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.440
Come on, you all were thinking it, right?

19:28.440 --> 19:30.340
You already had it pre-ordered.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.400
Who wasn't like Dark Soccer, weren't you looking forward to taking out your aggressions with

19:33.400 --> 19:36.200
the Wii, like chainsaw people's faces off or whatever you can do in the game?

19:36.200 --> 19:37.760
I don't know, I'm making stuff up.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.760
No.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.760
No?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.320
I didn't really care about this game, I didn't like the first one.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.160
Oh, you actually played the first one?

19:43.160 --> 19:44.640
Yeah, I had it on Dreamcast.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.640
Oh, how was it?

19:45.640 --> 19:46.640
Kind of crappy?

19:46.640 --> 19:47.640
Oh, okay.

19:47.640 --> 19:50.080
Well, Dan liked it.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.880
It was an okay game, it just wasn't my type of game, so I didn't...

19:52.880 --> 19:53.880
Was it on Dreamcast?

19:53.880 --> 19:56.240
Yeah, it only came out in Europe.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.720
I didn't give two shits about it, so...

19:57.720 --> 19:58.720
Alright, well fair enough.

19:58.720 --> 19:59.720
Okay, so...

19:59.720 --> 20:01.240
So, I mean, I'm the wrong person to ask.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.240
Alright, fine.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.880
So you didn't give a shit about the game, and so Loki and I, I'm assuming you never

20:04.880 --> 20:05.880
played the first Manhunt.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.080
I never really played the first Manhunt.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.680
I've got it on PlayStation, PS2, if you ever want to borrow it.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.200
No, I could have that too.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.480
It doesn't have the Wii-mote.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.400
I can't actually pretend I am chopping wieners off and whatever.

20:16.400 --> 20:20.400
I can slice people across their abdomen in Trauma Center and that's rewarding.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.840
Okay, good point.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.320
Okay, here's the thing.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.320
Here's the thing.

20:24.320 --> 20:28.800
Okay, so it's rated AO for the Wii, because you're simulating murder in that.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.860
Why is the PlayStation 2 unrated AO as well?

20:31.860 --> 20:33.260
That makes no sense to me.

20:33.260 --> 20:38.680
You're not simulating murder with the Wii-mote, so that factors out of it, and that was their

20:38.680 --> 20:43.700
reasoning behind it, saying, oh, this is why it deserves an AO rating instead of mature.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.520
So now you're just kind of went completely against that and said, oh, well, actually

20:47.520 --> 20:51.960
because we hate Take-Two and Rockstar, and we want to make an example of them.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.440
That's what it really is.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.440
Chat comments.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.160
We have a shitload of people in chat tonight.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.960
Thank you guys for making our chat room a huge success tonight.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.880
Morrie says, would this have been made into as much of a big deal if it was being developed

21:02.880 --> 21:07.000
by someone besides Take-Two who didn't have to deal with the whole hot coffee thing?

21:07.000 --> 21:10.120
I say yes, because I don't think this has anything to do with Take-Two, but the gaming

21:10.120 --> 21:12.160
industry in general, personally.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.400
I think it does have to do with Take-Two.

21:14.400 --> 21:15.400
Look at it.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.400
Look at Bully.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.400
Look at Manhunt 2.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.800
People were protesting that game before they even saw screenshots of it.

21:20.800 --> 21:27.640
After applied to Black Devil RX, necks can have orifices if you have a tracheotomy or

21:27.640 --> 21:28.720
you cut someone's head off.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.080
What was the comment?

21:31.080 --> 21:33.240
There was a comment about neck rape on there.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.240
Oh, interesting.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.080
I also want to read another comment from Black Devil RX.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.680
Adults only is a stupid rating.

21:38.680 --> 21:39.840
There's no need for it.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.600
It should be more like an NC-17 thing, because right now they're saying that adults aren't

21:43.600 --> 21:47.600
mature, which is the rating below AO.

21:47.600 --> 21:51.480
That's my whole problem with it, is that I actually don't have a problem with this game

21:51.480 --> 21:52.600
being rated AO.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.200
It probably should be, as should some other games that are out there on the market that

21:56.200 --> 21:57.400
came out with an M rating.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.300
I don't have a problem with these games being rated AO.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.300
They are for adults only.

22:02.300 --> 22:03.300
Kids should not be playing these games.

22:03.300 --> 22:08.200
I have a problem with society's response to the AO rating.

22:08.200 --> 22:11.160
It's the same thing with the NC-17 rating.

22:11.160 --> 22:17.560
The NC-17 rating in movies is like the kiss of death, whereas personally, if I had a kid,

22:17.560 --> 22:22.020
I would much rather they see a movie like Showgirls that has a little nudity and sex

22:22.020 --> 22:28.080
in it than a movie like Hostel or Hostel Part 2, which had a lower rating.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.880
It's just a little sex, but then again, that might not be a fair comparison, because we're

22:30.880 --> 22:32.860
talking about sex versus violence.

22:32.860 --> 22:33.860
We're here with Manhunt.

22:33.860 --> 22:34.860
It's all violence.

22:34.860 --> 22:41.240
Well, it's just like with a lot of the ratings on these games and stuff, Grand Theft Auto.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.240
There's a perfect example.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.240
San Andreas.

22:43.240 --> 22:47.200
That game had a bunch of murdering and killing of people and stuff, but oh my god, show a

22:47.200 --> 22:50.980
little bit of digital booby and boom, AO.

22:50.980 --> 22:55.360
See double fucking standards right there.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.520
I don't even know what the problem is with these people.

22:57.520 --> 23:03.840
Okay, granted, it is an adult-only game, and mature I would think pretty much satisfies

23:03.840 --> 23:10.680
that, because 17 and older, 18 and older, I think between 17 and 18, for the most part,

23:10.680 --> 23:12.960
people are maturing that much.

23:12.960 --> 23:17.520
I think at 17, you probably know right and wrong about as much as you do when you're

23:17.520 --> 23:18.520
18.

23:18.520 --> 23:23.000
I think the dividing line of maturity is when you start paying your own bills.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.400
That's actually a really good point.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.400
That's a good point.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.280
I know a lot of people in their 20s that live with mommy and daddy that aren't as mature

23:29.280 --> 23:30.480
as some people I know that would be out at 17.

23:30.480 --> 23:37.400
I don't understand why they don't just have M as the cap off for that, or you just leave

23:37.400 --> 23:38.400
it at M.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
Here's the thing.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.720
I don't want to drag this topic on too long, because it's been debated to death all week,

23:41.720 --> 23:46.480
but I do want to get one other thought out here, and that would be about how, and I'm

23:46.480 --> 23:51.200
getting a private message from Brad from Pod Culture saying, actually, games should use

23:51.200 --> 23:54.240
the same rating system as movies that would make things easier to understand.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.840
It's how they did in Europe.

23:55.840 --> 23:59.520
I think to an extent that's what they kind of tried to do with the ESRB is I think they

23:59.520 --> 24:03.080
tried to copy the movie ratings without copying them.

24:03.080 --> 24:08.480
So I think an M rating is supposed to be like R, no one under 17 admitted without parent

24:08.480 --> 24:10.960
or guardian, and same thing.

24:10.960 --> 24:15.200
They would sell you a game as long as your mommy or daddy is there with you and the clerk

24:15.200 --> 24:16.480
says what's in the game.

24:16.480 --> 24:21.920
But AO is like NC17, no one under 17 admitted period, parents or not.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.760
This is just not an acceptable thing.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.640
That would be, I think, the thing with the AO rating.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.800
This game is not sold to anyone over 18.

24:29.800 --> 24:30.800
It's like cigarettes.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.800
You do not sell it under any circumstances.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.420
Well, it's just like the M-rated games.

24:34.420 --> 24:39.600
Those are not intended to be played by kids that are under 17.

24:39.600 --> 24:43.560
So it is, in a sense, like the NC17.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.600
It's just people don't treat it that way and then until someone goes and murders somebody

24:47.600 --> 24:49.720
then they're all, oh my God, it was the game's fault.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.560
I had no idea.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.200
All right.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.480
Well I guess that's that.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.140
If you'd like to comment on this, Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com would be the place

24:58.140 --> 25:02.040
to send those emails and we've got to move on though because there was actually other

25:02.040 --> 25:03.820
stuff that happened in the gaming world this week.

25:03.820 --> 25:07.700
It was hard to find it amongst all the Manhunt 2 news but there was some other stuff going

25:07.700 --> 25:08.700
on, right, Loki?

25:08.700 --> 25:09.700
Yes.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.700
In fact, some interesting stuff.

25:11.700 --> 25:15.480
This has kind of been a trend with Microsoft right now, securing a lot of exclusive rights

25:15.480 --> 25:21.000
of things, one of which being Grand Theft Auto 4 episodic content.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.420
Apparently they've spent $50 million in securing this episodic content, which to me that seems

25:27.420 --> 25:34.000
like an awful lot of money to spend to secure content for a game that's downloadable.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.560
I would be very interested if there are some announcements at E3 or something.

25:39.560 --> 25:43.800
I was thinking that maybe they're going to announce that it's going to be an Xbox 360

25:43.800 --> 25:47.940
exclusive for the game because that's quite a bit of money that they're throwing at them,

25:47.940 --> 25:50.980
but whatever, either way.

25:50.980 --> 25:56.100
So if you own the 360, you're going to be able to download the episodic content in about

25:56.100 --> 26:00.900
two batches, one of which is supposed to hit mid next year and then the rest at the end

26:00.900 --> 26:06.340
of next year, so $25 million for each.

26:06.340 --> 26:10.080
I think honestly though, I heard this broken down brilliantly.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.480
I can't remember where I heard it.

26:11.480 --> 26:15.440
I want to say our buddies at All Games Interactive, when I was listening to them on Monday waiting

26:15.440 --> 26:19.920
to go on the air, I heard something like this and that would be that they're going to make

26:19.920 --> 26:23.900
money on this, they're going to make a lot of money on this because Grand Theft Auto

26:23.900 --> 26:26.800
4 will sell millions of copies.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.960
Let's say they sell, what is it?

26:28.960 --> 26:32.640
Let's say they sell 5 million copies of the game, at least, on Xbox 360.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.000
They sell 5 million copies of the game and people are going to download this, let's say

26:36.000 --> 26:40.340
they charge $10 for the episodic content, they're going to make their $50 million back

26:40.340 --> 26:41.340
right there.

26:41.340 --> 26:44.320
Now granted, I'm assuming that everybody's going to buy it, which isn't going to happen,

26:44.320 --> 26:48.140
but I'm only considering one piece of downloadable content for $10.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.280
If they release three pieces of downloadable content for $10, they'll more than make their

26:51.280 --> 26:53.240
money back and then some.

26:53.240 --> 26:57.080
Plus, they have something that Sony doesn't, which in the end might move some consoles

26:57.080 --> 27:00.720
and so on and so on because I know people that are holding out for this game, Game 360.

27:00.720 --> 27:05.560
Plus, gamer picks and themes and all sorts of crap that they can market using Grand Theft

27:05.560 --> 27:06.560
Auto.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.560
There you go.

27:08.560 --> 27:16.520
You know what, to be honest, I'm not too surprised that they're actually doing this because the

27:16.520 --> 27:23.680
PlayStation Network so far, downloadable content for games has been almost nonexistent.

27:23.680 --> 27:26.800
Just to clear this up, because I'm still a little unsure on this, because I seem to remember

27:26.800 --> 27:30.600
when this game was first announced, they said, okay, the PlayStation 3 is going to have this

27:30.600 --> 27:35.000
downloadable content and the Xbox 360 will have this different downloadable content.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.720
Microsoft is basically paid to stop the PlayStation 3 exclusive content from coming out at all.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.720
I think so.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.160
Interesting.

27:44.160 --> 27:49.640
I guess that's why they did it, to try and move some more systems and get people, because

27:49.640 --> 27:53.200
the game will be that much more on the 360.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.520
This isn't the first game that they were doing this.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.640
In fact, now they're saying that a beautiful Katamari is going to be a 360 exclusive as

27:59.640 --> 28:00.640
well.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.600
No, who knows about that.

28:02.600 --> 28:07.140
GS191 says something interesting, the three items for download, a gun, a car, and a sex

28:07.140 --> 28:09.060
mini game.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.980
It's not going to be stupid shit like that.

28:10.980 --> 28:15.880
It's going to be actual episodic, brand new storylines and stuff like that.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.760
Not like you get a brand new gun.

28:18.760 --> 28:22.800
Black Boy says Take Two is actually talking about selling 10 million units by the end

28:22.800 --> 28:23.800
of 2008.

28:23.800 --> 28:28.120
I don't know amongst what systems, because you're going to have your Sony fanboys and

28:28.120 --> 28:32.600
people that bought the PlayStation 3 over the Xbox 360 during last year's Christmas

28:32.600 --> 28:36.120
craze that don't really give a shit about the downloadable content.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.320
They just want the game and all that.

28:38.320 --> 28:43.320
I think there's a chunk of that 10 million that's going to stay on Sony's side.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.320
We shall see.

28:44.320 --> 28:51.880
Well, speaking of downloadable content, Eidos UK has said that the Tomb Raider anniversary

28:51.880 --> 29:00.520
for Xbox 360 is going to be available as a series of downloads in conjunction with Tomb

29:00.520 --> 29:02.960
Raider Legend.

29:02.960 --> 29:12.240
Basically you're downloading each of them as different parts of the game, with free

29:12.240 --> 29:17.920
downloads being Lara's Manor, all that type of stuff.

29:17.920 --> 29:23.480
However, each of these episodes are going to be about $30 apiece, 2,400 Microsoft points.

29:23.480 --> 29:28.280
I wouldn't suppose there will be a downloadable topless Lara patch like there was on the PC

29:28.280 --> 29:29.280
versions.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.280
No.

29:30.280 --> 29:33.560
That's most unfortunate.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.240
They're saying that the first two are going to be available in September.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.240
Wow.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.840
I don't know though, I kind of don't care about Tomb Raider anymore.

29:39.840 --> 29:44.720
I played that Tomb Raider game on the 360, I don't even remember what it was called,

29:44.720 --> 29:48.400
the retail release that came out a few months ago, I didn't really dig it, kind of over

29:48.400 --> 29:49.400
Lara Croft.

29:49.400 --> 29:53.520
Yeah, I haven't really cared about her since you could throw her off the balcony in Tomb

29:53.520 --> 29:56.440
Raider II and break her neck and do the exploding code.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.940
It was kind of fun to kill her off.

29:57.940 --> 30:02.200
And lock her butler in the lock-in freezer.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.200
Could you really do that?

30:03.200 --> 30:04.200
Yes, you could.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.000
That's the only way you could keep him from following you.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
All right.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.120
Well, while those downloadable contents will be out in September, there's plenty of games

30:11.120 --> 30:12.240
coming out before then.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.080
We're going to travel around the world and cover some upcoming release dates.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.960
And what better way to start it off than listen to me horribly butcher some Japanese game

30:19.960 --> 30:22.160
names of the stuff that's coming out soon.

30:22.160 --> 30:26.720
On the Xbox 360 on June 28th, Project Silpheed is coming out.

30:26.720 --> 30:32.320
It's actually going to the Asian regions, not just Japan.

30:32.320 --> 30:37.760
A Donkey Kong Bongo Blast and Taru Jet Race is coming out on the Nintendo Wii on June

30:37.760 --> 30:38.760
28th.

30:38.760 --> 30:43.480
I believe that is the Bongo-less Bongo game because you have the Wiimotes.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.440
Kind of fun, interesting.

30:45.440 --> 30:51.500
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Marvel Ultimate Alliance finally hits Japan on June 28th.

30:51.500 --> 30:55.600
And also you can get Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas in the Japanese region on that same

30:55.600 --> 30:58.480
day, all coming out on June 28th.

30:58.480 --> 31:03.160
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, a game called Baroque from Sting.

31:03.160 --> 31:08.520
A special edition of Devil May Cry 3, but that's just a price reduction really.

31:08.520 --> 31:12.280
Also an earlier version of Dragon Quest goes into the Ultimate Hits collection.

31:12.280 --> 31:15.680
I believe this is one of the side quest stories.

31:15.680 --> 31:21.120
Actually a special edition thing for Devil May Cry 3, I believe is the one that they

31:21.120 --> 31:25.560
released over here where it was the greatest hits, but they also added an additional playable

31:25.560 --> 31:28.600
character and additional difficulties.

31:28.600 --> 31:32.720
This is a reduction for a Dragon Quest 8 spin-off story that was on the PlayStation 2, and I

31:32.720 --> 31:33.720
don't remember this game being here.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.860
I don't know if they have reported this over here, perhaps somebody else in our chatroom

31:36.860 --> 31:38.560
knows a little more about that game.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.560
No.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.120
Now I don't think that game ever came out here, because that's because the game is way

31:42.120 --> 31:43.740
bigger over in Japan.

31:43.740 --> 31:49.960
Also coming out, Metal Slug on the PlayStation 2, yes, moving into the best hits.

31:49.960 --> 31:50.960
What?

31:50.960 --> 31:51.960
What?

31:51.960 --> 31:52.960
What?

31:52.960 --> 31:53.960
What?

31:53.960 --> 31:55.680
I love Metal Slug.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.240
I'll kill you.

31:58.240 --> 32:05.560
Let's see, also coming out on June 28th in Japan, Neon Genesis Evangelion Battle Orchestra.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.560
What?

32:06.560 --> 32:08.600
Excuse me, what?

32:08.600 --> 32:13.400
Why do they keep putting out games for that anime that's been, what, 10 years gone now?

32:13.400 --> 32:14.400
Because people buy them.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.280
The ones on Saturn sucked.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.840
The one on Nintendo 64 sucked.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.440
Why do they keep doing it?

32:20.440 --> 32:26.240
Tales of Fandom Volume 2 coming out from Namco Bandai on June 28th, also on the PlayStation

32:26.240 --> 32:27.240
2.

32:27.240 --> 32:31.880
Taito Memories, also known as Eternal Hits, coming out in two versions.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.960
That's Gekkan and Jukkan, and I believe that's very similar to what we have over here as

32:35.960 --> 32:40.800
the Taito Greatest Hits collection, the comparable thing we have here already in America.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.200
Also coming out in Japan, The King of Fighters XI moving into the best hits collection on

32:45.200 --> 32:46.200
the 28th.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.320
That's in case moving a lot of stuff into best hits on PlayStation 2.

32:50.320 --> 32:56.520
Quickly checking the handheld systems, Kuri Kuri DS is coming out on June 28th.

32:56.520 --> 32:58.320
Otasuke Island.

32:58.320 --> 33:03.880
This looks like one of those cute little chibi games, I don't know, it's an action game.

33:03.880 --> 33:08.560
Looks like with bunnies and an angry pink bunny sailing a ship.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.940
That's what I can tell from the box art, because I don't bother to read up on what these games

33:11.940 --> 33:13.240
are really about.

33:13.240 --> 33:18.840
Konami is releasing a game over in Japan on the DS called Otona no Joryoku Kentai, which

33:18.840 --> 33:21.880
looks like a game with sexy ladies.

33:21.880 --> 33:26.680
Looks like another dating sim type game, I'm not sure what this is.

33:26.680 --> 33:29.560
Looks like another dating sim type game, we'll just call it that.

33:29.560 --> 33:33.880
And let's see, also coming out, I'm just checking real quick to see what's coming out on the

33:33.880 --> 33:35.840
PSP.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.480
Lots of releases here on June 28th.

33:37.480 --> 33:46.080
Ratchet & Clank gets its PSP release on June 28th, and just for Jamie, Secret of Evangelion

33:46.080 --> 33:51.960
Portable coming out on the 28th.

33:51.960 --> 33:52.960
That's it!

33:52.960 --> 34:01.200
I wish it was all Neon Genesis over here too, that would have been funny, but it's not.

34:01.200 --> 34:07.040
So anyways, next week there's a ton of releases, a lot of them coming out based on movies,

34:07.040 --> 34:10.360
one of which is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, that's going to be coming

34:10.360 --> 34:18.800
out on almost everything, PlayStation 2, PSP, 360, PlayStation 3, and the Wii, PSP, and

34:18.800 --> 34:22.240
I believe DS also.

34:22.240 --> 34:26.720
Then of course Ratatouille, that's going to be coming out on almost everything, PlayStation

34:26.720 --> 34:34.880
2, GameCube, PlayStation 3, 360, and the Wii, DS, and PSP.

34:34.880 --> 34:40.400
Now Transformers, that's going to be coming out on all the console systems, so that'll

34:40.400 --> 34:42.040
be pretty cool.

34:42.040 --> 34:49.000
And then on the Wii, we've got Pokemon Battle Revolution, so that's pretty slick.

34:49.000 --> 34:55.080
The Biggs is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Wii, PlayStation 3, and 360, kind of like

34:55.080 --> 34:58.320
an arcade style baseball game.

34:58.320 --> 35:02.040
Grim Grimoire is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, that one's supposed to be pretty

35:02.040 --> 35:03.680
good.

35:03.680 --> 35:09.760
Also on PSP, just this small little game called Final Fantasy is going to be coming out as

35:09.760 --> 35:10.760
well.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.320
What's that game about?

35:12.320 --> 35:13.320
I've never heard of it.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.800
I don't know, but I hear it's kind of a Japanese style game.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.800
Oh, then never mind.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.440
I don't know if I'll be playing that, but never mind.

35:20.440 --> 35:25.320
Then of course, this is actually something I'm interested in, TracksPad, it's kind

35:25.320 --> 35:31.600
of a portable music studio type thing, so I'm going to be picking that up, maybe make

35:31.600 --> 35:33.960
some music with that.

35:33.960 --> 35:39.280
And then on 360 also, we had Hour of Victory coming out, Overlord, it's making its way

35:39.280 --> 35:45.960
out here, and on PlayStation 3, hopefully, Rainbow Six Vegas, because that thing's

35:45.960 --> 35:50.520
been delayed so many freaking times.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.160
And I believe that's it.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.480
I have some stuff.

35:53.480 --> 35:56.120
Alright, who's release dates do you have?

35:56.120 --> 35:57.720
These are the UK release dates.

35:57.720 --> 36:03.480
On the 26th, we have Cosmic Family for Wii, and Harry Potter and the Odor of Phoenix.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.920
Sorry, Odor.

36:05.920 --> 36:12.680
And then a bunch of crap on the 29th, we have Crazy Taxi, Fair Wars on PSP, I love Crazy

36:12.680 --> 36:20.600
Taxi, Driver Parallel Lines, Final Fantasy 6 Advance, which I already have in my purse,

36:20.600 --> 36:25.660
Hour of Victory, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition, more brain training from Dr. Kalashima, How

36:25.660 --> 36:29.880
Old is Your Brain?, Project Silpheed, I want Project Silpheed!

36:29.880 --> 36:30.880
Sorry.

36:30.880 --> 36:31.880
Few more weeks.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.880
Few more weeks.

36:33.880 --> 36:38.960
No, you have no idea, I played the shit out of Silpheed on the Sega CD.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.680
Second week in July.

36:40.680 --> 36:46.520
When I saw the thing for Project Silpheed, I about crapped my pants or something, I don't

36:46.520 --> 36:47.520
care.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.520
Oops, I crapped my pants.

36:48.520 --> 36:49.520
Oops, I crapped my pants.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.160
I was all like, Silpheed, pretty.

36:51.160 --> 36:54.360
Did you make that little moaning noise that you made earlier?

36:54.360 --> 36:57.080
That made the chat room go, oh really?

36:57.080 --> 37:03.240
Anyway, Puzzle League DS, Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition, which I hear is absolutely really

37:03.240 --> 37:11.920
awesome, Super Stardust HD on Playstation 3, Tenchu Z, The Darkness, sounds like a bad

37:11.920 --> 37:20.320
fan fiction, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas,

37:20.320 --> 37:26.360
Vampire Reign, Agon Lost Swords of Toledo, is that like Ohio?

37:26.360 --> 37:27.360
Is this Toledo?

37:27.360 --> 37:28.360
Is that Ohio?

37:28.360 --> 37:34.840
Okay, we're going to Ohio to look for the sword, and Eye of Shit, I mean Eye of Judgment.

37:34.840 --> 37:35.840
What the?

37:35.840 --> 37:36.840
Wait, Eye of Judgment?

37:36.840 --> 37:37.840
Wait, no, no, no.

37:37.840 --> 37:38.840
PlayStation 3.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.840
Aw, something's gotta be screwed up with that calendar.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.840
29th.

37:41.840 --> 37:42.840
Really?

37:42.840 --> 37:43.840
Yep.

37:43.840 --> 37:44.840
What?

37:44.840 --> 37:45.840
That's a bit early, it seems.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.840
It does.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.840
And Steel Horizons.

37:47.840 --> 37:52.640
I was going to say, there's a few that I missed for the U.S. Darkness, which isn't just a

37:52.640 --> 37:55.320
fan fiction, I hope you know.

37:55.320 --> 38:00.880
It's actually a Top Cow comic, I believe, I thought it was published by Image as well,

38:00.880 --> 38:02.880
being made into a live action movie as well.

38:02.880 --> 38:08.840
It's kind of like a cross between demonic possession and a mafia story type thing, basically

38:08.840 --> 38:11.800
rip people apart with demons.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.520
And what was the other one?

38:13.520 --> 38:16.400
Oh, Driver Parallel Lines for the Wii, but you know, you probably don't want to pick

38:16.400 --> 38:19.200
that one up anyways, so.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.200
Darkness.

38:20.200 --> 38:25.880
Isn't that a cliche thing to call your game or whatever, Darkness, I don't know.

38:25.880 --> 38:30.400
But that's the name of the comic book series, the Darkness.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.600
It's the demonic thing that possessed him.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.280
Alright, anything else, Dark Sakura for our UK listeners?

38:35.280 --> 38:36.280
Your mom!

38:36.280 --> 38:37.280
Really?

38:37.280 --> 38:38.560
What platform is she coming out on?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.640
The Last Knight platform.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.480
I hate you.

38:42.480 --> 38:45.680
Going over to the Virtual Console, I know a lot of you kids like to download the old

38:45.680 --> 38:50.160
school classics on the Wii Virtual Console, and leave it to the ESRB to blow some more

38:50.160 --> 38:52.440
ideas on titles that are coming out.

38:52.440 --> 38:56.560
Shining Force is coming out for the Sega Genesis soon.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.080
Super Turrican and Super Turrican 2 soon.

39:00.080 --> 39:04.640
But most interesting of all, a game called Dr. Mario Wii.

39:04.640 --> 39:08.640
Now you'll notice that the Wii, now people don't really know what this is, if this is

39:08.640 --> 39:13.120
like a typo, if they just meant to put Dr. Mario and they put like the Wii or whatever

39:13.120 --> 39:18.840
is in there, or if this is actually like a whole new game, hmm, wouldn't that be something,

39:18.840 --> 39:22.520
a whole new game based on Dr. Mario?

39:22.520 --> 39:23.520
That sounds like fun to me.

39:23.520 --> 39:27.000
I would be really impressed if it were SNK, but unfortunately...

39:27.000 --> 39:31.480
I don't think it would be, seeing as Dr. Mario is a Nintendo license.

39:31.480 --> 39:35.280
No, I'm talking about the whole new game part.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.280
Alright.

39:36.280 --> 39:40.260
Alright, well that's pretty much it, so be on the lookout for that, and hopefully that

39:40.260 --> 39:42.520
Dr. Mario Wii thing is a new thing.

39:42.520 --> 39:47.840
You know, in my mind, if that is something new, that would be the perfect thing to release

39:47.840 --> 39:49.560
the week of E3.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.560
Mark my words.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.500
Dr. Mario Wii.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.740
It's a start.

39:53.740 --> 39:57.240
It's not, you know, probably a game that a lot of us are going to get super duper excited

39:57.240 --> 39:58.520
about, but it's a start.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.440
It's something we don't have yet.

40:00.440 --> 40:01.440
You know what I mean?

40:01.440 --> 40:04.640
It's something new being made for the Wii, if that makes any sense.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.680
It's better than everybody votes channel, okay?

40:06.680 --> 40:08.940
Let's just leave it at that.

40:08.940 --> 40:12.100
Everybody votes channel!

40:12.100 --> 40:13.960
Everybody votes to change this channel.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.360
I fucking hate that channel, by the way.

40:16.360 --> 40:19.120
Just completely useless.

40:19.120 --> 40:25.800
Anyways, so, interesting rumor, kind of also associated with Nintendo here.

40:25.800 --> 40:33.160
That would be that they will be licensing their properties to be made into games onto

40:33.160 --> 40:37.720
the Apple iPhone.

40:37.720 --> 40:42.160
I don't know if anyone remembers, back in the day, there was a certain platform which

40:42.160 --> 40:46.640
they licensed their games to be made onto.

40:46.640 --> 40:52.480
Yeah, CDI games didn't turn out very well.

40:52.480 --> 40:58.600
But apparently, they're supposed to be coming out on the iPhone, priced at about $29 each.

40:58.600 --> 41:05.860
So is $29 worth paying for a downloadable game that's going to be probably a remake

41:05.860 --> 41:07.840
of Mario Brothers?

41:07.840 --> 41:08.840
I don't know.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.480
Sounds more like a rumor to me.

41:10.480 --> 41:14.040
Okay, the most interesting thing about this story, like, I could kind of care less about

41:14.040 --> 41:15.040
the game.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.920
I personally am not interested in the iPhone, but I have a lot of friends who are, like,

41:17.920 --> 41:21.400
doing the campout thing and all that crap to get this stupid phone.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.760
Not my thing, but I don't have $600 to burn.

41:24.760 --> 41:26.300
For those that want it, hey, good for you.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.320
Can I have a loan?

41:28.320 --> 41:33.520
But the point behind this story, Yuri Lover in chat sums it up perfectly, OMG, Nintendo

41:33.520 --> 41:35.120
and Apple are in bed together.

41:35.120 --> 41:39.280
I mean, this is what the fanboys wanted, like, years ago.

41:39.280 --> 41:44.200
They kept saying, gee, Nintendo likes to put cute things out, Apple likes to put cute things

41:44.200 --> 41:48.320
out in different colors, just like Nintendo, why aren't these companies in bed together?

41:48.320 --> 41:53.780
And here they go, there's a little foreplay going on here with this story, right?

41:53.780 --> 41:54.780
Is this foreplay?

41:54.780 --> 41:57.320
I think it's just a rumor, to be honest.

41:57.320 --> 41:58.480
You think this is just bullshit?

41:58.480 --> 42:02.720
I think this is bullshit, but it wouldn't surprise me that they're going to try to

42:02.720 --> 42:06.680
whore themselves out and it wouldn't surprise me that stupid morons that pay $600 for a

42:06.680 --> 42:11.400
fucking phone would pay $30 for downloadable content on said phone.

42:11.400 --> 42:15.620
Geniuses that buy this shit, so, way to go.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.440
You know what, maybe you should go purchase a Playstation 3 while you're at it, since

42:18.440 --> 42:22.360
you didn't have all this excess money to throw around.

42:22.360 --> 42:23.800
Are you just mad because you're poor?

42:23.800 --> 42:25.680
No, I don't want this fucking phone.

42:25.680 --> 42:28.840
I would not pay $600 for a goddamn phone.

42:28.840 --> 42:33.600
So anyway, for anyone who is one of our friends in the UK, they just got a big treat on the

42:33.600 --> 42:35.480
Virtual Console.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
Guess what's out?

42:36.480 --> 42:37.480
Mega Man!

42:37.480 --> 42:39.240
Um, your mom, oh.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.560
No, my mom doesn't put out for me.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.560
Mega Mom.

42:43.560 --> 42:50.020
Mega Man just made it out for 500 Wii points, and from Turbografx-16 China Warriors is another

42:50.020 --> 42:51.320
new one on there.

42:51.320 --> 42:59.440
They are both games from 1989, but, um, dude, I'm just excited about Mega Man, because,

42:59.440 --> 43:01.920
you know, all the Mega Man 2, though, was really the better game.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.360
Mega Man, though, was really cool.

43:04.360 --> 43:05.960
Is one of the ones that has beaten.

43:05.960 --> 43:10.640
I like Mega Man and all, but what about, you know, the whole Mega Man collection that was

43:10.640 --> 43:13.080
on GameCube and the Wii's backwards compatible, you know?

43:13.080 --> 43:14.080
Do people care?

43:14.080 --> 43:15.080
Yeah, me.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.720
I'm not gonna spend money on the Virtual Console Mega Man when that game's out there.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.500
Well, neither am I. I mean, I have the freaking cartridge.

43:20.500 --> 43:24.760
By the way, I can't lend you one of my Nintendos, but that's another story.

43:24.760 --> 43:30.480
Um, but, you know, but for people who may not have bought the collection or may just

43:30.480 --> 43:34.960
say, oh, well, that's pretty cool, Mega Man, they might want to get it, so.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.320
So in other words, for lazy people who are one-click shoppers.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.320
Yeah.

43:38.320 --> 43:39.320
Alright, there you go.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.320
Very good.

43:40.320 --> 43:41.320
Very good.

43:41.320 --> 43:42.320
Then carry on.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.320
And talk to me later about the Nintendo.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.320
Carry on one-click.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.320
Did you say you can borrow it?

43:45.320 --> 43:46.320
I have, like, three.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.320
You can borrow one.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.320
Sweet!

43:48.320 --> 43:49.320
I thought you said you can't.

43:49.320 --> 43:50.320
No.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.720
I'm totally gonna get a copy of Guardian Legend for myself.

43:52.720 --> 43:54.720
You can borrow mine, too, if you want.

43:54.720 --> 43:55.720
Awesomeness.

43:55.720 --> 43:56.720
I'm not playing it.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.720
I can only tear myself away from World of Warcraft.

43:58.720 --> 44:05.920
There are free, easier methods to, you know, obtain Guardian Legends to play it on a console.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.240
It's not the same.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.240
It's not the same.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.240
I can't explain it.

44:09.240 --> 44:10.240
It's not the same.

44:10.240 --> 44:12.000
Those little imperfections bug me.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
There's something rewarding about blowing on the cartridge and putting it in the machine

44:16.000 --> 44:18.300
and it'll finally work at some point.

44:18.300 --> 44:19.300
I don't know.

44:19.300 --> 44:20.880
I'm not talking about that.

44:20.880 --> 44:24.180
Hopefully there's a lot of rewards from this game as well or else there's gonna be a lot

44:24.180 --> 44:28.360
of people that are pissed off because Spore, which you might remember was my favorite game

44:28.360 --> 44:32.400
I saw at last year's E3, well, I'm gonna be waiting a long frickin' time to play this

44:32.400 --> 44:40.500
game, as are all of you, because this game has been pushed back to the fiscal year 2009.

44:40.500 --> 44:46.400
That means that it will, at earliest, come out in April of 2008.

44:46.400 --> 44:51.480
Now some folks were, you know, this game was already supposed to be out, then it got pushed

44:51.480 --> 44:54.880
back to this fiscal year, then it got pushed back to next fiscal year, then it was like,

44:54.880 --> 44:58.840
oh, it's gonna come out by the Christmas, oh, it's gonna come out first quarter 2008,

44:58.840 --> 45:04.680
here we go again, it just got delayed to April 2008 at the earliest.

45:04.680 --> 45:08.520
And it's so weird because when, you know, when we saw the demo, I was like, this game

45:08.520 --> 45:10.400
looks like it's almost done.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.400
The game looks great.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.360
I mean, maybe that's why they only showed us one element of the game, you know, maybe

45:15.360 --> 45:18.760
looks can be deceiving, but I don't know.

45:18.760 --> 45:22.120
It's just it's a massive game and they want to make sure they get it right, that's all.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.880
For a change, yay!

45:24.880 --> 45:29.840
Gerardimo calls this game in our chat room Spore Forever, a little play on Duke Nukem

45:29.840 --> 45:30.840
Forever, get it?

45:30.840 --> 45:36.360
Yeah, but at least we've actually seen screenshots and like, you know, playable Spore, like,

45:36.360 --> 45:39.940
you know, because they show, I mean, even though you weren't able to play the demo yourself,

45:39.940 --> 45:46.240
they did kind of like a, you know, a user-assisted tutorial type thing at E3 and it looked, it

45:46.240 --> 45:47.240
looked pretty awesome.

45:47.240 --> 45:51.360
I mean, it was awesome enough to get me the most excited over any other game I saw at

45:51.360 --> 45:52.360
E3 last year.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.960
It looked awesome.

45:53.960 --> 45:57.040
But nevertheless, I am pissed off about the fact that this game is delayed.

45:57.040 --> 46:02.120
I don't know how Loki and Dark Sakura feel, but since I'm at the soundboard and I'm angry

46:02.120 --> 46:15.600
enough, I push the button and out come the FUs.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.160
Dark Sakura, start us off.

46:17.160 --> 46:20.320
Um, FU to life.

46:20.320 --> 46:21.320
I'm sorry to hear that.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.320
That's it?

46:22.320 --> 46:23.320
Yeah.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.720
But that's a good blanket FU to kind of encompass everything.

46:26.720 --> 46:30.560
Oh yeah, because there's a whole bunch of shit going on, so FU to all of it.

46:30.560 --> 46:31.560
Sorry to hear that.

46:31.560 --> 46:38.960
Uh, once again, I would like to repeat my distaste for street smart cool cat.

46:38.960 --> 46:45.320
That fucking idiot can die in a fire and I hope your game sucks balls and does not sell

46:45.320 --> 46:46.560
one piece.

46:46.560 --> 46:50.640
It is horrible and you need to stop.

46:50.640 --> 46:56.320
I would like to say FU to Bobby Blackwell for correcting me in chat saying dude knew

46:56.320 --> 47:01.600
them forever was playable at E3 1998 on the Quake 2 engine.

47:01.600 --> 47:07.840
FU Bobby and your old show 100 weeks, whatever.

47:07.840 --> 47:08.840
Just kidding.

47:08.840 --> 47:09.840
I heart Bobby.

47:09.840 --> 47:16.720
I also want to say a big FU to the DMV because I have to go there tomorrow and nobody likes

47:16.720 --> 47:20.040
going to the DMV because I have to get my license renewed because my birthday is coming

47:20.040 --> 47:23.880
up and I got to get that all taken care of before my birthday or else I won't have a

47:23.880 --> 47:24.880
driver's license.

47:24.880 --> 47:30.720
FU to the possibility I may not have a driver's license.

47:30.720 --> 47:31.720
That's it.

47:31.720 --> 47:36.840
Anyways, so there's something actually pretty cool coming out of the homebrew scene and

47:36.840 --> 47:43.000
that is a sequel, a homebrew sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog and it actually looks pretty

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
cool.

47:44.000 --> 47:52.200
The name of the game is Sonic the Hedgehog XG or Extended Genesis and pretty much captures

47:52.200 --> 47:57.100
the original Sonic the Hedgehog game series very accurately.

47:57.100 --> 48:03.080
It's scheduled to have 10 unique zones, 18 acts along with his secret zone after Chaos

48:03.080 --> 48:11.600
Central and no word though on what it's coming out on, I would assume PC, but pretty

48:11.600 --> 48:12.600
awesome.

48:12.600 --> 48:16.320
They have a video on Destructoid if you want to check it out.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
Really cool looking game.

48:17.320 --> 48:21.320
Not even really a fan of the Sonic the Hedgehog series.

48:21.320 --> 48:26.480
Hopefully it gets released and you can download it before Sega's lawyers get on them.

48:26.480 --> 48:28.920
Oh, that would be nice.

48:28.920 --> 48:35.240
Well, other Sonic news that I think is actually kind of cool is BioWare is doing a Sonic RPG

48:35.240 --> 48:36.720
that's going to be on the Nintendo DS.

48:36.720 --> 48:39.600
It's supposed to be out in 2008.

48:39.600 --> 48:46.120
There's not a whole bunch out on it, but it's just saying that Sega is standing behind

48:46.120 --> 48:50.080
what BioWare has planned doing and BioWare wants to do it, blah, blah, blah.

48:50.080 --> 48:51.800
So I hope it's good.

48:51.800 --> 48:52.800
It could be.

48:52.800 --> 48:57.720
You know, they did good stuff for what, didn't they do Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic,

48:57.720 --> 48:58.720
so...

48:58.720 --> 49:04.040
And the upcoming Mass Effect game, which is going to be like one of the best role playing

49:04.040 --> 49:05.560
games for the 360.

49:05.560 --> 49:06.760
You hope.

49:06.760 --> 49:07.760
It looks...

49:07.760 --> 49:08.760
It does look pretty frickin' amazing.

49:08.760 --> 49:09.760
Amazing.

49:09.760 --> 49:10.760
Look at that.

49:10.760 --> 49:16.000
Every time I hear about this, I think about the Mario RPG for some sick reason.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.320
I mean, because you know, Squeenix helped to make, well, it was just Square back then,

49:19.320 --> 49:23.880
but Squaresoft made the Mario RPG game, and that was like a top of the line developer,

49:23.880 --> 49:27.960
especially back at that time at the... I remember Final Fantasy was like all the rage

49:27.960 --> 49:29.800
at that point.

49:29.800 --> 49:34.240
Just kind of interesting that now you have this BioWare who's kind of like also an A-list

49:34.240 --> 49:36.160
developer kind of making this Sonic RPG.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.600
I just hope it doesn't blow chunks like all the other Sonic games that have come out in

49:39.600 --> 49:40.600
the past three years.

49:40.600 --> 49:41.600
My thoughts exactly.

49:41.600 --> 49:46.240
And you know, that makes me also pissed off because remember there was, I think, Square

49:46.240 --> 49:49.640
Enix was saying that they wanted to dedicate themselves to the Nintendo platforms.

49:49.640 --> 49:52.280
Make me another goddamn Super Mario RPG.

49:52.280 --> 49:56.660
Since you've dedicated yourself to the Nintendo platforms, why don't you make yourself useful

49:56.660 --> 50:02.680
and do that instead of making another fuckin' sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

50:02.680 --> 50:03.960
It's a BlackDevilRX in chat.

50:03.960 --> 50:08.320
It says, Sega and BioWare are in bed... We have a lot of in bed stories tonight.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.320
What's up with that?

50:09.320 --> 50:10.320
Go figure.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.480
Before we get to the next story, I actually want to share this comment.

50:13.480 --> 50:17.160
BlackBoy, thank you buddy, who actually was featured on GayGamer.net this week, by the

50:17.160 --> 50:18.160
way, I noticed.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.160
Congratulations to you, BlackBoy.

50:19.160 --> 50:24.680
He actually sent me a link that contests the whole Spore is Delayed story that we just

50:24.680 --> 50:25.680
reported on.

50:25.680 --> 50:30.600
Apparently, another website picked this up, NextGen.biz, a pretty popular site for gaming

50:30.600 --> 50:35.620
news, picked up that actually there's a little bit of misinformation going on with that story.

50:35.620 --> 50:39.320
They already announced a long time ago that the game was going to be delayed to the next

50:39.320 --> 50:43.920
fiscal year, but some people were picking up this story, and for some reason saying

50:43.920 --> 50:48.460
that the fiscal year 2009 meant April 2009, which isn't the case.

50:48.460 --> 50:54.120
We did say that meant April 2008, but EA wants to tell you that's not nothing new.

50:54.120 --> 51:01.600
There's a quote here from... This comes from John Riccitello, CEO, says, quote, there seems

51:01.600 --> 51:04.280
to be some misinformation flying around.

51:04.280 --> 51:08.420
Nothing's changed since our call on May 8th, where John Riccitello specifically said that

51:08.420 --> 51:14.660
we were moving Spore from fiscal 08 to early fiscal 09.

51:14.660 --> 51:17.520
Maybe that Spore thing wasn't news after all, but I'm still angsty about it.

51:17.520 --> 51:18.680
That's a long time to wait.

51:18.680 --> 51:21.000
I actually still was thinking it was coming out Christmas this year.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.040
I somehow missed the boat on that story.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.040
Go figure.

51:24.040 --> 51:26.280
Nevertheless, thanks for the corrections.

51:26.280 --> 51:31.560
We report on what's big on the gaming blogs out there and what catches our eye, and we're

51:31.560 --> 51:35.840
not always going to be 100% on target, but we try to get close.

51:35.840 --> 51:38.800
Hopefully, this is accurate, because this is something trying to foresee things a little

51:38.800 --> 51:39.800
bit.

51:39.800 --> 51:46.120
This would be the list of Halo 3 achievements coming to you, thanks to Xbox360achievements.org.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.800
For those of you that are achievement point whores, Loki...

51:48.800 --> 51:50.840
I'm buying the game.

51:50.840 --> 51:51.840
You're not buying it?

51:51.840 --> 51:52.840
No.

51:52.840 --> 51:55.120
You're not really a first-person shooter fan, right?

51:55.120 --> 51:56.280
Not really a Halo fan.

51:56.280 --> 52:00.160
If I bought it, would you want to borrow it to try and get some of the achievements?

52:00.160 --> 52:01.160
No.

52:01.160 --> 52:02.160
All right.

52:02.160 --> 52:05.420
Well, for those of you that like to get your achievements and you like your Halo, you can

52:05.420 --> 52:09.960
be looking forward to some various achievements, including basically it looks like every chapter

52:09.960 --> 52:14.240
in the game gets its own achievement, up to nine chapters, the ninth chapter being called

52:14.240 --> 52:20.520
Return, some achievements for when you complete the campaign on Normal, Heroic, and Legendary,

52:20.520 --> 52:24.840
also some Hidden Skulls, looking like they claim some different achievements throughout

52:24.840 --> 52:25.840
the game.

52:25.840 --> 52:30.600
Then, of course, there are some various player versus player achievements, awards being given

52:30.600 --> 52:39.780
for Triple Kill, Overkill, Headshots, and then some achievements still in question because

52:39.780 --> 52:44.880
you actually see the achievement says score over X amount of points in the campaign meta

52:44.880 --> 52:50.480
game on the second mission for some various achievements named such thing as Demon, Gorilla,

52:50.480 --> 52:56.160
Vanguard, Reclaimer, so looks like about nine different achievements there, so kind of interesting.

52:56.160 --> 53:00.400
So that's what the achievements look like for Halo 3.

53:00.400 --> 53:04.400
Someone was asking me in chat room what my favorite all-time first-person shooter is.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.720
TimeSplitters 2, fucking awesome game.

53:08.720 --> 53:15.040
Anyways, let's see here.

53:15.040 --> 53:18.320
There's some interesting developments in the whole Immersion thing.

53:18.320 --> 53:25.440
Remember back, Immersion, of course, sued Sony over the rumble technology in their controllers.

53:25.440 --> 53:31.520
So now we've got Microsoft suing Immersion, and the reason is apparently because the whole

53:31.520 --> 53:37.320
Sony lawsuit, and since they settled on that, that violates some sort of agreement that

53:37.320 --> 53:40.920
Microsoft had with Immersion when they were licensing the technology.

53:40.920 --> 53:46.320
According to Microsoft, Microsoft licenses technology in both in and out and relies on

53:46.320 --> 53:49.820
these agreements to be honored and enforced.

53:49.820 --> 53:53.840
Our request to the court is that all companies and industry partners should play by the same

53:53.840 --> 53:57.920
rules and that the binding agreement we signed with Immersion be honored.

53:57.920 --> 54:03.740
In other words, they're suing because they settled with Sony, and basically that would

54:03.740 --> 54:09.320
kind of say that Sony is not playing by the same rules, so I don't know.

54:09.320 --> 54:11.320
Poor babies.

54:11.320 --> 54:15.960
Let's pout and sue.

54:15.960 --> 54:20.240
What exactly, somebody remind me, because I haven't really been following the details

54:20.240 --> 54:21.240
of all these stories.

54:21.240 --> 54:23.920
I just see the headlines and I go, oh, lawsuit, lawsuit.

54:23.920 --> 54:26.940
What exactly has Immersion done for gaming?

54:26.940 --> 54:29.840
They developed apparently rumble technology.

54:29.840 --> 54:32.040
Apparently they developed rumble technology.

54:32.040 --> 54:34.460
Well, they have trademarks, so.

54:34.460 --> 54:39.180
But was it one of those things where like, because I remember, did they develop the first,

54:39.180 --> 54:42.800
what is it, the Nintendo CC4 rumble pack was the first thing that had rumble, right?

54:42.800 --> 54:44.360
Yeah, I think so.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.720
Did they develop that?

54:45.720 --> 54:46.720
No.

54:46.720 --> 54:52.240
It's one of those companies that makes a patent or patents something and then sits on it until

54:52.240 --> 54:55.760
someone makes it and then they go and sue them.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.240
Interesting.

54:57.240 --> 55:02.480
Because I'm like, what exactly has Immersion done besides sue people and get sued?

55:02.480 --> 55:03.760
Like have they ever made a game?

55:03.760 --> 55:05.840
Have they ever made a third party product?

55:05.840 --> 55:06.840
No.

55:06.840 --> 55:07.840
Nothing.

55:07.840 --> 55:08.840
Interesting.

55:08.840 --> 55:13.340
So, what a waste of everybody's time this company seems to be, unless I'm totally missing

55:13.340 --> 55:17.280
something here, because I can't think of anything Immersion has actually done.

55:17.280 --> 55:21.520
I'll look them up on Wikipedia during this next statement, where Dark Soccer is going

55:21.520 --> 55:27.520
to surf the internet ups and down and all over and try to find her favorite website

55:27.520 --> 55:31.120
of the week, and this better be a good one, because it is a special show tonight.

55:31.120 --> 55:38.120
Dark Soccer, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?

55:38.120 --> 55:41.600
Today's website of the week is one that should be near and dear to the hearts of anyone who

55:41.600 --> 55:44.560
has ever gotten married.

55:44.560 --> 55:47.520
It's UglyDress.com.

55:47.520 --> 55:53.880
It's a dress, it shows the worst bridesmaids dresses ever with photographs.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.480
And these are really awful.

55:56.480 --> 56:06.280
There's one on here that looks like a flag, and I'm not even joking, it's really nasty.

56:06.280 --> 56:15.520
And it's not just weddings either, it's ugly cakes, and ugly shoes, and tuxedos and shit.

56:15.520 --> 56:19.160
It's really just awful, awful stuff.

56:19.160 --> 56:26.200
There's some show that they all watch on Ventrilo in World of Warcraft, the guild, and it's

56:26.200 --> 56:27.920
very similar to what you're talking about.

56:27.920 --> 56:31.040
It's like, God, now I can't remember the name of the show.

56:31.040 --> 56:35.400
It's like Fashion Emergency or something like that, or you can't wear that outside.

56:35.400 --> 56:36.880
I can't think of the name of the show.

56:36.880 --> 56:39.080
Loki, you're laughing, you know what I'm talking about?

56:39.080 --> 56:40.360
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

56:40.360 --> 57:03.700
I don't know, but when Dark

57:03.700 --> 57:15.280
War

57:15.280 --> 57:21.000
Anyway, I looked up Immersion Corporation, by the way, on Wikipedia.

57:21.000 --> 57:25.880
BlackWolf in chat came to save the day because BlackWolf knows more about gaming than I do,

57:25.880 --> 57:26.880
apparently.

57:26.880 --> 57:31.200
BlackWolf said, Sky, Immersion patented the technology behind the PlayStation and Xbox

57:31.200 --> 57:33.000
Rumble technology.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.800
And I'm looking at Wikipedia here.

57:34.800 --> 57:39.080
Immersion Corporation of San Jose, California is a developer of Haptic Technology.

57:39.080 --> 57:41.180
The company was founded in 1993.

57:41.180 --> 57:45.240
Immersion's technology is employed in automotive, entertainment, medical training, mobility,

57:45.240 --> 57:50.160
personal computing, and three-dimensional simulation applications.

57:50.160 --> 57:54.120
Immersion's patent portfolio includes over 500 issues or pending patents in the U.S.

57:54.120 --> 57:55.840
and other countries.

57:55.840 --> 58:00.780
Immersion was used as an example in an article on patent trolls by Game Daily Biz.

58:00.780 --> 58:05.200
So I guess we're not the first people to say something about that, so kudos to Game Daily

58:05.200 --> 58:06.200
Biz.

58:06.200 --> 58:07.880
I'm glad they have something called patent trolls.

58:07.880 --> 58:08.880
That's kind of funny.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.460
Thank you, Wonder Dog Herald in chat.

58:10.460 --> 58:13.040
It's called What Not to Wear, is the name of the show.

58:13.040 --> 58:14.200
It's called What Not to Wear.

58:14.200 --> 58:17.720
So you should check out that show, DarkStarter, because I know you don't watch TV.

58:17.720 --> 58:18.720
Isn't that on style?

58:18.720 --> 58:19.720
Here's a torrent.

58:19.720 --> 58:20.720
I don't know.

58:20.720 --> 58:21.720
That's on Style Network.

58:21.720 --> 58:22.720
I think so.

58:22.720 --> 58:23.720
Why do I know this?

58:23.720 --> 58:24.720
I don't even have that.

58:24.720 --> 58:26.960
Because your wife probably watches it.

58:26.960 --> 58:29.800
It totally sounds like something your wife probably watches.

58:29.800 --> 58:39.920
All right, anyhow, just trying to get caught up on some other chat room comments here.

58:39.920 --> 58:45.880
Saikun says, stop using us, Rob, because I guess I'm using the chat room to do research

58:45.880 --> 58:48.760
tonight.

58:48.760 --> 58:50.320
Let's go on to another story here.

58:50.320 --> 58:54.140
Last week we had a fun little debate on video game addiction, which you'll remember Jamie

58:54.140 --> 58:56.080
lost because she made fun of me.

58:56.080 --> 58:57.520
And when you make fun of me, you instantly lose.

58:57.520 --> 58:58.960
But I make fun of you all the time.

58:58.960 --> 58:59.960
I know.

58:59.960 --> 59:00.960
And so you lose all the time.

59:00.960 --> 59:01.960
No, just kidding.

59:01.960 --> 59:05.720
But what's interesting about this is this is a news article that was released by the

59:05.720 --> 59:06.720
Associated Press.

59:06.720 --> 59:11.080
So it was picked up on sites by Yahoo and CNN and some of those sites.

59:11.080 --> 59:15.560
Video game addiction could possibly be a new diagnosis.

59:15.560 --> 59:19.280
This is somewhat a bit of a follow-up to the article we were talking about last week.

59:19.280 --> 59:23.680
The AMA is going to be having this meeting, and it already started in Chicago.

59:23.680 --> 59:27.520
And the council is going to be asking the group to lobby for the disorder to be included

59:27.520 --> 59:32.280
in a widely used mental illness manual created and published by the American Psychiatric

59:32.280 --> 59:35.000
Association, video game addiction.

59:35.000 --> 59:40.520
Now if this were actually happening, this could mean that possibly your insurance would

59:40.520 --> 59:44.080
cover this as any other type of mental disorder like alcoholism.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.800
So would they have to cover buying more games?

59:47.800 --> 59:51.440
Because obviously I'm addicted to games, and I need that.

59:51.440 --> 59:52.440
I can't wean myself up.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.840
I don't think it works like that actually.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.920
It's like the gum or something.

59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.040
Most insurance companies don't cover this type of thing very well anyway, even if it

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.040
even covers it at all.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.680
I mean, insurance companies have to cover certain mental conditions, but I don't think

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.680
this is one of them.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.440
It's my medicinal pot because I'm stuck playing video games.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.440
Actually insurance companies don't cover, don't ask me how I know so much about insurance,

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440
but I do.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:19.760
Insurance companies don't cover marijuana because it's not a federally recognized drug.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.640
It's only recognized in certain states.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.240
So your insurance company typically won't cover marijuana, just so you know.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:26.480
But you can get a prescription for it.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.200
You can in certain states.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.200
Yes.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200
Including California.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.200
And there's only certain farms that are allowed to grow it.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.160
I'm sorry, how did we get from video game diagnosis story to pot growing?

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.200
Because we give our listeners what they want to know.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.600
I see.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.280
Anyway, from the story here, I want to point this out.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:48.280
Joyce Protopapas of Frisco, Texas said her 17-year-old son Michael was a video game addict.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.680
Actually, the story says a video addict.

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.440
Over nearly two years, video and internet games transformed him from an outgoing academically

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.520
gifted team into a reclusive manipulator who flunked two 10th grade classes and spent several

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.080
hours a day and night playing a popular online video game called World of Warcraft.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:09.040
My father was an alcoholic and I saw exactly the same thing and Michael said, Protopapas,

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.520
we battled him until October of last year.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.520
We went to therapists.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.060
We tried taking the game away.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:15.300
He would threaten us physically.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.360
He would curse and call us every name imaginable.

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.360
It was if he was possessed.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.480
And when she suggested to therapists that Michael had a video game addiction, nobody

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.520
was familiar with it.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.140
They all pooh-poohed it.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.760
And finally, they found a therapist and they sent Michael to a therapeutic boarding school,

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.960
$5,000 a month that the insurance didn't cover to get him kicked off the video game.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.480
You know what my mom would have done if I flunked a class over video games?

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.980
She would have thrown the TV out a window or she actually did this once.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:47.520
She took the power cord to the Nintendo so I couldn't hook it up to the TV for months

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.400
and I wasn't at the age where I could just run out and buy a new power cord because I

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.020
was only 14 when this happened.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:58.240
So I couldn't hook up the Nintendo for a couple months because I was doing badly in a class.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.280
And I realize the mom is saying that the kid was going off and threatening her physically

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.280
and all this other stuff.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.120
But to me, that's a whole other issue that needs dealing with.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.040
That's like just making a bad thing worse to add the whole world up thing.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.720
I'm powerless to do anything about these video games.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.540
Fucking bullshit is what it is.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:21.460
She needs to get off her fucking drunken ass and take care of her damn kids is what she

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:23.680
needs to do.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.680
I don't know.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.720
I think it's stupid that she couldn't just take away the game system.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:28.720
He's a 14-year-old.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.920
Beat the crap out of him.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.800
It's easy.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800
If she can't do it...

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.160
I don't know if I would go that far.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.780
She should put him in one of those deprivation tanks.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.400
It sounds like he had a lot of problems besides just video games and maybe he should have

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.380
gone to the boarding school already.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:46.840
That's a good idea.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.560
I agree with you, Rob.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.440
Once again, you know, other problems and then because he's playing video games, obviously

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.760
the video games have a problem.

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:55.760
Fucking hate people.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.760
Hold on.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.840
Did Jamie say she agreed with me?

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.880
Oh my God.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.800
It only took five years and finally Jamie agrees with me on something.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.360
This is a blessed holy day.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.360
I'm so excited.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.080
Jamie finally agrees with me.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.840
Is this like your present to me on this anniversary show or something?

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840
Rob?

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.840
What?

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.840
Rob.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840
What?

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.840
Rob.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.840
Rob.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.840
I will kill you in the face.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.840
Art, you're...

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.840
Have a jammy dodger.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.280
I don't want a jammy dodger.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.960
Hey, all of our Eddie Izzard fans, I bought jammy dodgers.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.600
Will you dodger that jammy when I shove it up your ass?

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.640
Then fine.

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.940
You don't get any of the, um, stuff I bought for part B.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.680
No, but I want the stuff you brought for part B.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.380
The stuff I bought for part B is great.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.380
So...

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.380
Sorry.

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.420
Some news comes from apparently a...

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.420
Oh wait.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.420
I'm sorry.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.420
Can I read chat comments?

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.480
chat that was a big story so I'm sorry I

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.360
was too busy fighting with Jamie I hope

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.480
you all will understand Ross deal UT

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.660
says it's a symptom of a larger problem

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:57.040
that is ignored because the video games

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.680
are a scapegoat that's a very good word

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.360
for what's going on there scapegoat gold

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.380
banjo says I have so much video game

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:07.000
systems and stuff that I always have

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.480
stuff to do when my parents take away

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.440
something well maybe they need to lock

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.360
you in a room with with fluffy walls and

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.360
I don't know blaze says I don't buy this

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.160
addiction thing those types of doctors

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.680
are the same to buy into the whole truth

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.040
serum thing yikes all right anyway

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.880
someone is now you can do your story so

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.720
apparently there is this is coming from a

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.560
game spot forum poster said they were

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.800
took part in a recent survey about a

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.440
unannounced PlayStation Network episodic

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.640
game called nine-to-five apparently the

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.160
game is supposed to be kind of like an

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.240
interactive sitcom where you're

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.440
basically kissing the boss's butt to

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:48.880
avoid being fired you know all sorts of

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.720
weird stuff like that kind of like the

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.520
office or something anyways they're

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.560
saying that it's supposed to have four

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:58.360
episodes which introduce you to mega

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:02.480
Corp I guess a multinational corporation

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.120
obviously fake each episode supposed to

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.560
be about three hours long with sitcom

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.760
storylines and cliffhangers about 25

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.640
characters they're going to be in the

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.680
actual thing and you can interact with

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.560
each one of them including like flirting

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.520
and whatnot apparently it's going to be

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.200
written by written and I guess voice

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.720
acted by people that have been on comedy

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.560
Central's Saturday Night Live Daily Show

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.240
spell show Conan Bryan etc interesting

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.880
and the game supposed to run about five

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.640
dollars for an episode or fourteen

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.280
dollars for all four Wonder Dog Herald

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.360
says nine-to-five should be based on the

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.600
movie fuck yes but Dolly Parton hell

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.640

and DS shock and I'm so say guess what

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.400
they're all the same and they're still

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.440
not as good as Animal Crossing fucking

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.240
same and you people still buy him we're

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.840
starting to wrap up this segment here

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.640
but not out before a couple more stories

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.640
here we want to show Sony a little love

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.720
we haven't really talked a whole lot

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.320
about them tonight we got to say this

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.240
Sony and I don't know if you would

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.600
consider this love though because this

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.320
may be an anti Sony statement I don't

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.240
know here but what's going on here is

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.800
that Sony who is the direct the director

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.120
of PlayStation Network operations Eric

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:43.600
Lempel said that the PlayStation Network

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.360
may not always be free he said basically

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.160
that the PlayStation Network's only real

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.880
difference over Xbox Live is the price

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.840
which you know mmm interesting but then

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.800
of course then this other exec kind of

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.120
stepped in and then said well it may not

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.240
always be free so kind of interesting

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.160
and I wouldn't say that's the only

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.920
difference between the two well yeah

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.400
that in the Xbox Live Marketplace has a

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.280
lot of content or as the PlayStation

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.480
Network as I understand it has very

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.480
little content now granted PlayStation

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.280
it has some very good content like that

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.040
Tekken game good start and you know

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.560
there's a lot of promising things about

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.720
some of these originals they're making

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:19.560
on PlayStation Network they look a heck

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.040
of a lot more promising than some of the

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.280
rehash stuff we get on Xbox Live but you

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.560
know is it gonna be too little too late

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.840
that's you know all I worry about so

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.880
that's nice speaking of something a

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.600
little too little too late Dead or Alive

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.400
the movie is delayed forever and it

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.680
finally came out and how did it do well

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.360
it sucked it stinks as Jay would say

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.320
from the critic apparently opened on

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.200
505 screens across the country and

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.640
pulled in a whopping two hundred and

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.280
thirty two thousand dollars which is

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.240
crappy that's about four hundred and

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.120
sixty dollars per screen oh my god

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.640
that's atrocious that's like what movies

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.800
at discount theaters make like that's

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.600
what a movie is like almost on video

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.680
what it's supposed to make that's really

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.760
bad is that because of is that because

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.800
piracy ruined it is that because I never

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.040
saw a single ad for this game outside of

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.720
the internet anywhere I don't think the

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.840
advertising motion lack of emotion but

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.080
it also opened up against what the hell

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.080
did open up against something that was a

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.400
lot better than it was well to any other

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.840
movie I think it opened up against not

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:36.520
pirates but I mean pirates came out

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.760
shortly before it but just any other

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.520
movie but Fantastic Four I think came

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.240
out the same week Silver Surfer that's

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.920
right which I don't know I'm hearing

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.720
that movie ain't all that either but I

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.200
don't I don't I still want to see it it

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.640
depends on who you ask I don't I don't

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.440
get excited about summer movies anymore

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.240
except for Transformers I really do want

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.720
to see Transformers I didn't want to see

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.040
until I saw those last few trailers let's

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.920
see Ross steel UT says sky it's because

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.040
it sucked and that's what Cy Coon says

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.560
to us because it fucking sucked the afro

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.080
guy said why isn't the dead or alive

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.600
movie on DVD I mean why didn't it go

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.840
straight to DVD that's a good question

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.000
Loki I don't know you used to do before

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.920
you were doing games distribution you

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.040
did movie distribution so any insight on

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.400
that what kind of movies tend to go

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:26.200
directly to DVD well besides the Disney

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.880
sequels like Cinderella three there are

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.400
a lot of Disney sequels they go straight

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.560
to DVD usually movies that they don't

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.120
want to spend money on advertising

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.440
because it costs a lot of money to

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.560
advertise a movie and if they feel it's

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.440
not going to do that well in theaters

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.080
they'll release it straight to DVD you

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.800
get actually there are there's a whole

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.240
you know set of was it a movie companies

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.400
that do knockoff movies in fact their

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.920
latest one happens to be spoofing I'll

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.160
really call it spoofing but having the

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.120
exact same plot line and stuff as

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:07.680
transformers is called transmorphers you

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.520
know go bot and also they have was it

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.200
snakes on a train stuff like that so a

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.880
lot of that goes I like cheese just said

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.600
that snakes on the train yeah but um I

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.400
don't know also what was that movie we

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.960
all watched cheerleading ninjas or

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.240
whatever that was cheerleader ninjas

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.080
then it was incredible that was not I've

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.800
got some good ones though I've got some

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.240
good ones that are coming out was it

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.880
dead clowns about zombie clowns that's

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.560
going to be cool oh god it's a clowns

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.000
what's your house from outer space killer

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.320
clowns from outer space that's gonna be

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.400
awesome no that already came out I know

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.840
years ago I know and it was awesome when

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.760
I have a whole clown horror night people

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.040
are raving about the DVD sequels in chat

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.840
even though this isn't game related I

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:55.200
guess it is a little bit dark Tetsuya

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.680
says I mean really Bambi to WTF I know

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:01.240
what the hell Bambi to Bambi to my mom

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.320
is still dead no Bambi to Bambi was

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.560
grown up and it's his kids now so oh

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.660
well that makes it okay that's a big

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:09.720
Disney cop-out I'm sorry the only Bambi

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.560
to I was ever interested in was there

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.640
was Godzilla vs. Bambi and then Godzilla

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:18.600
vs. Bambi to Bambi's revenge Godzilla

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.080
vs. Bambi was alone in the dark to the

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.600
afro guy says isn't there a Lion King 4

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.120
I don't think I don't know if there's a

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.680
Lion King for but if I remember right

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.840
there was a Lion King like two and a

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.200
half one in a one and a half but one of

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.280
these movies I don't know if it was one

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:33.920
and a half or Lion King three one of

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.640
these movies was where the Lion King's

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:39.840
forever Simba's friends what were his

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:42.240
friends name that's right too many

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.200
people like the side story about where

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.840
the friends are right now yeah was what

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:50.000
wall they what the hell was that no it

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
It was funny.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
It was pretty funny.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
They actually did...

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.880
It was Lion King One and a Half and it was about what was going on from their perspective

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880
and stuff.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880
And I don't know.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880
It was kind of neat.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880
It was funny.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880
But yeah.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.880
There's a lot to go straight to DVD.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.280
I mean, just look at your video store.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.280
I mean, your local video store.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.280
So why not Dead or Alive?

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.720
This was a prime candidate to go straight to DVD.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.000
It was supposed to go straight to DVD at one time, but they decided, hey, we're going to

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.280
release it to the theaters because people are going to go see it.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.940
Boy, were they wrong.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:19.760
But how much money does it cost to put a movie in theaters?

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.480
I mean, if they didn't spend any money on promotion, did they really lose anything?

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.480
Not a whole lot.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.480
They probably wouldn't lose anything.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.360
And it actually probably would help the film a little bit, especially if they leave it

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.320
in there long enough to do a few million dollars.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.360
Because they'll be able to get that one critic.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.480
Because the thing about putting your movie in theaters is that the critics will review

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480
it.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:43.560
So you'll get that one critic who will give the movie an amazing review just because he

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.960
wants to have his name in all the papers in the advertisement.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:58.760
Dead or Alive is a very tantalizing action movie.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.760
And it sucks.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.760
But they wouldn't say that.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.680
They'd leave that part out.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.680
Sexy action.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.960
If you were to call this movie great and awesome, you would be horribly wrong.

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:13.080
It's great and awesome.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:16.000
DJ Morpheus in Chat Room makes a local joke.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.420
Those of you folks from Sacramento will love this joke.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:24.000
And it's always Mark S. Allen.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.100
Tiger Claw says there's a Starship Troopers 3 in the works that's going straight to video.

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:31.120
And Casper Van Dien is reprising the role he did in the first movie.

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:33.720
That's because Casper Van Dien hasn't really done anything in the series.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.080
He has done a lot of things.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.080
Has he?

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.080
It's all straight to DVD.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.920
Well, that's a heck of a career.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.880
There's a lot of people that, that's how you know they've kind of lost it.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.160
There's a Jean-Claude Van Damme and fucking Steven Seagal, man.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.980
They're still making stuff.

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:51.980
A lot of things.

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:53.920
Because people actually buy that shit up.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.800
Same thing with Chuck Norris, dude.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.160
Chuck Norris hasn't made too much.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.080
I still say they need to do Chuck Norris vs. The World, you know, because I would say that

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.080
would totally fit.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.540
I say Freddy vs. Jason vs. Walker Texas Ranger.

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.860
How about that?

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.920
Chuck Norris vs. Michael Myers.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:12.760
Okay, now we're crazy.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:19.680
Alright, anyway, somebody also made a point much earlier, and I apologize because your

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.680
comments rolled way off the screen, but somebody said porn goes direct to DVD.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.680
All of it.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:25.680
Yeah.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:26.680
Well, I don't know.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.120
We don't really keep tabs of the porno theaters around here.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.120
Theaters weren't really what they used to be for porn, if you know what I mean.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.260
Jiranami would like to point out that Orange Lounge is not Baron's Chat.

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:39.680
That's a World of Warcraft joke.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.680
Anyhow, alright, I guess we're going to bring this segment to a close here.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:45.800
We're going to finish off part A here.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.600
However, part B is coming up, and we're actually going to put the news away tonight for part

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.400
B. We're all done with the news, and actually, I should ask real quick, Logie, do you have

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.400
any last minute things you want to add, because I know you had a few stories.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400
Maybe.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400
Alright, go ahead.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400
Go ahead.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400
Well, we'll do it later.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400
You want to do it later?

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400
Yeah, we'll do it later.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400
Alright, we'll do it later.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400
Fine.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400
We'll put it in part B. In an opportune time.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400
Alright, then perhaps we're not recording.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:19.760
The majority of part B will be your calls, and we're dedicating it to you guys, the fans,

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.160
the people that have listened every week, that have stuck with Orange Lounge Radio for

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.520
the past five years, and really helped made this show what it is, and quite honestly,

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:32.000
given us the motivation to continue to do this show.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
It's never really been about the number of people that are listening, because to put

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.120
it in perspective, we don't talk about the number of people we have listen to our show

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.840
very often, because to me, that's private information.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.600
That's not really, you know, that's our business, and we don't really need to brag.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:50.160
But for real, the very first episode of Orange Lounge Radio had 15 listeners.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:55.320
We had 15 listeners for episode one of Orange Lounge Radio, and that was after lots of hype,

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.120
lots of, you know, posting on DDR Freak, because we were a Bamani music-related show at the

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.120
time.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.120
And I couldn't.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120
Huh?

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.120
And I couldn't.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.120
That's right, because you were in a weird place.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.680
You were in a weird position at the time of DDR Freak Radio.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.240
And we can admit now, five years later, that a whole lot of this, this is the weirdest

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:15.000
thing happened here, is that Iguana Girl and I used to be BFF, but then we had like a major

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
falling out.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.240
And Iguana Girl and I didn't speak for like three years, seriously.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.480
It was pretty dirty.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.880
But the weirdest thing, and the reason why I can say that now is because we're cool now.

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:29.240
You know, we don't hang out every day, but, you know, she's got her life, I've got mine.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.680
We used to understand, we had a treaty.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:35.000
We had a peace treaty signature.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Anyway.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.120
But the weirdest thing happened is that DDR Freak Radio started, like, and Orange Launch

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.960
Radio, like both of us had the plans to do an online radio station.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.960
I didn't say anything.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.960
Yeah.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.960
And nobody, neither one of us kind of knew.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.840
And I knew both ends.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:49.600
So it was just kind of weird the way that happened.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.200
But regardless, why did we bring that up?

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:55.480
Oh yeah, because we, I tried to promote a lot on DDR Freak, and some of the other Bamani,

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.480
I can't remember if Bamani style even existed at the time, but some of the other DDR sites.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.480
Bamani style was around.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.480
Were they?

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.640
Some of the other sites that were around at that time, we tried to promote the show.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.680
We had a whopping 15 listeners for the first episode.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:10.780
And pretty much, honestly, guys, for about the first three years of Orange Launch Radio,

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.440
for about the first three years of Orange Launch Radio, I would say we were lucky if

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.960
we pulled 40 listeners in the third year.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.160
And that's just the way live radio is, boys and girls, you know.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.320
A lot of folks don't, you know, live 365 kind of limits us a little bit.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:27.680
And the fact that it's, you know, live show, you know, some other people have better things

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.560
to do Sunday night, which is understandable.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.420
But really, podcasting, audio blogging, whatever you want to call it, it really opened doors

01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:38.960
for us, because we were really fortunate to jump on that train before it really took off

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.400
when iTunes incorporated podcasting in June of 05.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.280
And that was just really awesome for us.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.400
And now our listenership is, you know, I can say it's in the thousands.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.720
It's not like, we're not talking like 9,000, more like two or three thousand people that

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.720
we have.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.720
We had the 4,000 week.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.520
Yeah, I mean, but you know, it doesn't, you know, whatever, it's just interesting that

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:01.640
it's blown up so much, thanks to this podcasting thing.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.800
But for me, really not a lot has changed.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.040
The motivation continues to be, because we don't hear from all 4,000 of you.

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.720
We appreciate the fact that you guys are listening to the show.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.640
Dear God, not all 4,000 people email me.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.640
We appreciate you guys listening.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640
I think they should.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.640
And you know, we don't...

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.640
We can check the email, how's that?

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.640
Let me say this too.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.440
I got to try to wrap this up, because I don't want to.

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:23.280
But we don't know if all 4,000 people are actually listening.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.900
There might be people that click on the file, but don't actually download it, you know.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:30.280
So we don't actually know exactly how many of those are actual, real listeners.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.460
We speculate we have about 1,800 real, actual people subscribing to the show.

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:36.760
But anyway, that's regardless.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.560
You know, we don't hear from all those people on a real, regular basis.

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.240
It's the chatters, it's the callers, it's the folks that send us emails, it's the people

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.480
that reach out that really have kind of given us that motivation to keep going for the past

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:48.480
five years.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480
At least that's how I feel.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.280
I don't know about you guys, but that's really been what it is.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:20:00.400
Well, I personally want to dedicate our success to the powers of the underworld.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.720
And that demonic pact you signed one day?

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.520
Yeah, but I got my, they refunded me my soul.

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.520
Loki, anything you want to add?

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.520
I don't know.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.320
What keeps you motivated week after week to do this program?

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.320
I'm motivated?

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.320
You're an asshole.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:16.320
I'm motivated.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:19.520
Like on my live journalism, I'm motivated by spite and porn.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.520
Alright.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.680
I'm motivated by my non-video game addiction.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.680
Alright.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:28.240
Well, anyhow, so we're dedicating part B to you guys, the listeners, tonight.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:31.640
We're going to open up the Skype lines all night long and just kind of BS with you guys

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.240
and just kind of talk about, you know, what you've been up to in gaming for the past five

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.240
years.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.440
We're going to talk about, you know, your favorite gaming memories and just whatever

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.880
question we feel like asking.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.520
Because also tonight, Dark Soccer and Loki don't know this, but usually I control the

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.520
Skype phone calls.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.520
Oh no, not tonight.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.000
We're going to take turns answering the phone tonight, so Loki you actually have to pay

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.040
attention tonight because we're all going to take turns answering the phone tonight.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.200
I don't like turns!

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.200
Too bad.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.520
So we'll be back and who knows what could happen.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.040
It's going to be a very interesting part B on this, our five-year anniversary.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.920
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent radio.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.200
You guys are awesome and you're the reason we're here.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.400
We'll be right back after this with more.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.780
