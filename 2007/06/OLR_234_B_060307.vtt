00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

00:04.760 --> 00:05.760
twice weekly.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.480
to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.480 --> 00:19.920
Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.920 --> 00:26.080
And weíre back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this our episode number 234 for June

00:26.080 --> 00:28.080
the 3rd of 2007.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.760
Weíll be celebrating our 5th anniversary on June 24th of this year if you can believe

00:32.760 --> 00:33.760
it.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.160
Thatís how weíve hit so many episodes if you wonder why 234 is a lot.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.760
Anyhow, weíre going to get back into some gaming news.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.800
Donít forget Orange Lounge Radio is in two parts every week.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.440
If you missed some, be sure to go back wherever you got this episode.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.100
Probably has part A linked as well.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.100
Be sure to grab that.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.000
Loki, why donít you start us off?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.440
Yes, and letís talk a little bit about the hacking cracking scene on the Xbox 360.

00:56.440 --> 01:04.280
Itís kind of interesting, Microsoft a couple of weeks ago took some precautions to ban

01:04.280 --> 01:06.760
modders from their live service.

01:06.760 --> 01:12.280
Well, in turn, modders have kind of fought back and theyíve created a brand new firmware

01:12.280 --> 01:21.240
upgrade for the Toshiba DVD drives for the TS-H943 that will allow you to play backup

01:21.240 --> 01:27.400
copies and legally purchase Xbox 360 tiles as well as it defeats all current and some

01:27.400 --> 01:31.880
future Xbox Live detection attempts.

01:31.880 --> 01:38.200
Because of that, itís actually allowing people to be able to use Xbox Live without them knowing

01:38.200 --> 01:42.720
that you have a modded console.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.840
Fight the fight, I guess.

01:44.840 --> 01:51.440
But Microsoft has always been really good about fixing this kind of crap the second

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
it comes out.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.440
They canít.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.440
Sorry, I shouldnít say crap.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.440
I mean, it actually is pretty smart.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.440
But you know what I mean.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.400
They put the ban hammer on this stuff ASAP.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.920
So how long is this going to last?

02:01.920 --> 02:03.520
Well, it depends.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.940
Weíll see how effective this stuff is, but thatís big business for them.

02:08.940 --> 02:16.560
If you look at Sony, theyíve tried and tried with the PSP, but thereís no luck there.

02:16.560 --> 02:21.160
I donít know how much of DVD firmware they can really detect.

02:21.160 --> 02:27.640
Thereís not really a lot that they can do, I think.

02:27.640 --> 02:32.400
And if they circumvent the few methods that they have of checking, they might be screwed.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.000
Unless they just do a whole hardware revision or something.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.840
I guess weíll see.

02:38.840 --> 02:39.840
I donít know.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.280
What do you think, DarkSakura?

02:42.280 --> 02:46.980
Do you think the hackers and crackers will win in this war, or do you think Microsoft

02:46.980 --> 02:49.320
will be able to stay on top of them?

02:49.320 --> 02:55.760
Thereís one thing that always works in favor of anyone who decides to system hack, and

02:55.760 --> 02:58.840
thatís called system becoming obsolete.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.080
Theyíre not going to care if the next oneís going to come out.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.600
Theyíll say, ìWell, screw the old one.î And everyoneís like, ìYay, we win!î Because

03:05.600 --> 03:07.480
we held out.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.760
So itís kind of like a waiting war, essentially.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.760
Yeah.

03:10.760 --> 03:11.760
Interesting.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.760
True.

03:12.760 --> 03:18.720
I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 2, they had granted the methods of doing swap

03:18.720 --> 03:23.900
disks and stuff like that, and the DVD loader and stuff, and now you have the whole running

03:23.900 --> 03:28.400
off of hard drives and stuff, and itís just like, shit, I mean, you donít have to buy

03:28.400 --> 03:31.240
anything for the PlayStation 2 anymore, you can download everything.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.120
If people want it bad enough, theyíll find a way.

03:33.120 --> 03:37.560
I remember the days of the seven swap trick for the first PlayStation.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.200
Well, look at the original Xbox.

03:39.200 --> 03:46.320
I mean, thatís, you know, modified firmware, running stuff off of hard drives, itís rampant.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.880
All right.

03:47.880 --> 03:52.120
I would say, too, if you donít want to get banned, donít take your console online, because

03:52.120 --> 03:53.120
thatís how they fix it.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.120
So, I donít know.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.320
But then again, I guess the whole hack is to have the advantage online.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.240
But I think thatís fucked up to cheat in online games.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.440
I think those type of people deserve to get banned.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.600
Well, I donít know if itís doing it for cheating in online games.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.320
I think itís just not having to buy those $60 games is what theyíre doing.

04:08.320 --> 04:09.920
Or maybe imports.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
Imports might be nice.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.160
Thatís kind of cool.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.240
Yeah, I think, I donít agree with region control.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.520
I mean, I understand why they do it, you know, so Iím not trying to say, like, oh, it makes

04:19.520 --> 04:23.480
no sense because, you know, because of licensing and all those other things for the music and

04:23.480 --> 04:27.720
what have you that they get in the games, but still, I mean, at the end of the day,

04:27.720 --> 04:33.360
it sucks for the consumer, you know what I mean?

04:33.360 --> 04:39.240
Anyhow, something else that is confusing, nevertheless, for the consumers is that Destructoid

04:39.240 --> 04:44.600
ran this article earlier this week about the Xbox 360 and the fact that Metal Gear Solid

04:44.600 --> 04:48.040
4 is confirmed for the Xbox 360.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.480
Now, the article was kind of weird.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.160
Like, you know, actually, itís funny.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.320
The guy who wrote it, Ron Workman, was actually on our year-end special, so Iím kind of wondering

04:56.320 --> 04:59.400
if we should call him up and try to figure out whatís going on, but I donít know if

04:59.400 --> 05:03.080
theyíll talk because, supposedly, Konami sent out a cease and desist.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.880
Now, Destructoid has always been a pretty respectable site in my mind, so I donít think

05:06.880 --> 05:10.160
theyíd pull these stories out of their butt, so Iím just kind of wondering, like, it was

05:10.160 --> 05:14.240
very interesting to kind of watch that happen where they had to be very vague about it and

05:14.240 --> 05:18.400
then they have this cease and desist coming from Konami, which seems to cement it, if

05:18.400 --> 05:19.600
that is legit.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.680
I mean, I donít know, could the whole thing be an elaborate prank?

05:22.680 --> 05:24.360
Who knows?

05:24.360 --> 05:28.520
But Computer Game World seems to think so because they ran a counter-story a little

05:28.520 --> 05:29.520
later on.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.520
Iím sorry, thatís Computer and Video Games.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.520
Sorry, carried it to the wrong side.

05:32.520 --> 05:37.360
Computerandvideogames.com ran a counterpoint a little later on in the week saying, ìKonamiís

05:37.360 --> 05:39.960
confirmed nothing,î is essentially what itís saying.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.640
So saying that, no, Metal Gear Solid 4 has not been confirmed for 360, Konamiís confirmed

05:43.640 --> 05:44.640
nothing.

05:44.640 --> 05:49.200
But the weird thing about this report is that theyíre basing it on the fact that theyíve

05:49.200 --> 05:53.820
talked to Konami and Konami refuses to comment on the rumors and that theyíve made no statement

05:53.820 --> 05:55.320
regarding the 360 version.

05:55.320 --> 06:00.240
And in my mind, I kind of go, ìWell, of course Konamiís not going to say anything about

06:00.240 --> 06:01.240
it.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.400
If they send a cease and desist to one site, itís because theyíre not ready to comment

06:04.400 --> 06:05.400
on this.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
Trust us.

06:06.400 --> 06:12.700
We know this very well, okay?î So it kind of doesnít mean anything.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.280
To me, that doesnít discount the story at all.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.280
So I donít know.

06:17.280 --> 06:23.000
Well, speaking of the rumor mill and Konami, wow, there actually were rumors that popped

06:23.000 --> 06:28.320
up in this monthís issue of EGM stating that Silent Hill 5 was going to be released this

06:28.320 --> 06:33.680
year and handled by Konami USA instead of in Japan.

06:33.680 --> 06:41.560
But there was also an interview with the director, Tsubuyama Masashi, who, like I said, was the

06:41.560 --> 06:45.440
chief director on the project.

06:45.440 --> 06:50.000
And he stated that they donít have anything official.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.200
There actually were looking more next-gen console, multi-platform, that he did say to

06:56.200 --> 06:59.600
keep your eyes on the upcoming press conference on July 11th.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.360
And thatís during E3, isnít it?

07:02.360 --> 07:03.360
Yep.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.360
Boom.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.240
So theyíll probably be revealing Silent Hill 5 at that time.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.240
Yeah.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.240
Interesting.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.440
Try to find my invite.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.400
Well, I donít know.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.480
As long as the series doesnít jump the shark, Iíll be okay.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.280
I think multi-platform is the way to go, though, honestly.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.280
More pea-hitty.

07:18.280 --> 07:21.720
Because, you know, Xbox 360 still hasnít really cracked the marketplace in Japan.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.520
I mean, obviously, I think most of us here would like to see it show up on 360.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.040
But over in Japan, you kind of have to put it on PlayStation 3.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.760
The Wii is just probably not going to be able to handle what theyíre going to want to do

07:30.760 --> 07:32.080
graphically with the game.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.520
You should have Silent Hill where you play as, you know, Pyramid Head.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.880
Itís Pyramid Head Adventures with Silent Hill.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.360
Well, you know, maybeÖ

07:40.360 --> 07:44.280
Watch that crazy cat as he goes and beheads people, the giant metal shark thing.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.400
No, he has to hump all the female monsters.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.360
Just the female monsters and rapes them and rips their skin off.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.120
Well, Iíll put a prediction out there.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.120
Remember that the Silent Hill is getting an arcade game.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.320
Remember we talked about that a while ago?

07:55.320 --> 07:58.260
There was some arcade expo and they showed a Silent Hill thing there.

07:58.260 --> 08:02.000
Maybe the Wii will get that because you could easily point and shoot with the controller.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
So maybe the Wiiís not on.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.880
Weíre talking Silent Hill Gun Survivor.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.520
Thatís kind of cool, though.

08:06.520 --> 08:13.000
Silent Hill Babies coming to ABC Family Saturday mornings.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.640
Underdog Harold says Pyramid Head Mysterious Dungeon would be a fun game.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
That would be great.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.440
With cutesy little music and everything.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.880
Super chibi, Pyramid Head, you know.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.520
Aww, he just beheaded the cat.

08:28.520 --> 08:33.800
That would be fantastic.

08:33.800 --> 08:38.140
Anyways, other interesting stuff.

08:38.140 --> 08:45.480
Coming out of the Halo 3 beta, thereís been people actually hacking the beta to reveal

08:45.480 --> 08:53.960
all sorts of fun stuff, including they have a brand new chopper that you can ride in the

08:53.960 --> 08:55.840
game.

08:55.840 --> 09:05.040
The sword as well as radar jamming items, player operated turrets added to the Wraiths,

09:05.040 --> 09:11.640
actually playing with the Wraith, and different modifications, including ground speed and

09:11.640 --> 09:14.200
gravity and all that sorts of stuff.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.840
And pretty cool, I guess, that you can modify the beta to do that.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.360
I canít believe people have already cracked the game and itís already in beta.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.400
Just imagine when the game actually comes out.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.600
Iím not surprised they did this because people love their Halo almost a little too much,

09:28.600 --> 09:30.600
you know what I mean?

09:30.600 --> 09:31.600
Yeah.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.600
Well, there you go.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.000
Also, something to mention about Halo 3 is that GamePro is going to be running an article

09:36.000 --> 09:40.280
talking about that there are, well actually I should say the article is going to be showing

09:40.280 --> 09:43.200
new vehicles, new maps, new weapons, and armor.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.360
Thatís right, because Halo 3 is going to have armor in it, new armor.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.560
You can create, I shouldnít say create, but you can get armor for your characters, like

09:51.560 --> 09:54.800
new shoulder pads, new helmets, so thatís kind of cool.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.560
Like I look at this one helmet on the particular scans from the site, it looks like an alien

09:59.560 --> 10:02.560
head or something on the helmet, so kind of neat.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.120
It looks like you can almost create your own character from all these custom parts, which

10:06.120 --> 10:07.120
is good.

10:07.120 --> 10:11.360
Itís kind of taking it a step further because in Halo 2 you can pretty much pick the human

10:11.360 --> 10:16.080
looking guy, the master chief, or the alien looking guy, and then you can choose the colors

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
in the emblem, thatís it.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.840
So I think that would be kind of fun if you could take it a step further.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.640
Suddenly Halo has turned Barbie, I donít know.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.480
That just seems to be a common thing.

10:25.480 --> 10:30.380
How long have games had multiple outfits and things that go on in them?

10:30.380 --> 10:33.440
Like Dead Rising, huh?

10:33.440 --> 10:41.320
Dead Rising has some new costumes and themes for Xbox Live, but the costumes are a white

10:41.320 --> 10:44.040
suit, a striped outfit, and an accountant outfit.

10:44.040 --> 10:49.560
Yeah, because I really like to look like an accountant when Iím beating up the undead.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.640
You know, I put on my suit.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.640
You could.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.120
I keep your tally.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.120
One beheading!

10:56.120 --> 10:57.120
Two beheadings!

10:57.120 --> 10:59.120
Doesnít that game keep up body kills anyway?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
Yeah, it does.

11:00.120 --> 11:04.840
So I guess you can look the part when youíre adding up the corpses.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.840
Anyway.

11:05.840 --> 11:11.040
And you can also dress up like an accountant and slam like a cash register into them.

11:11.040 --> 11:15.160
Itís like, ìKeep the change!î Office space the game.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.640
Do they have a Naked Time costume in that game?

11:17.640 --> 11:19.620
Like you know, Underoos or something?

11:19.620 --> 11:23.200
They have really tight like shorts that you can wear, little kidís shorts.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.200
I donít know about that.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.240
Thatís a little scary.

11:25.240 --> 11:30.400
You could run around as hard gay, beating up the zombies.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.400
All right.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
Good times.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.840
You know what they really need, though?

11:34.840 --> 11:40.920
They really need like the giant leafs that they have in, oh god, people that sing Yata.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.840
I canít remember the name of the band.

11:42.840 --> 11:43.840
Hapatai.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.840
Hapatai, yeah.

11:44.840 --> 11:46.440
Yeah, they need a giant leaf in that game.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.480
Thatís the only thing thatís missing.

11:49.480 --> 11:55.000
So some interesting stuff happening in New York this week, including some bills being

11:55.000 --> 12:01.960
passed regarding the ESRB ratings and selling minors M-rated games.

12:01.960 --> 12:09.720
Apparently, the law has passed and itís going to make a felony, a class E felony at least,

12:09.720 --> 12:16.360
the least severe felony in the state, if you sell a M-rated game to a minor.

12:16.360 --> 12:24.760
So better be careful before you sell those Mortal Kombat and Grand Theft Autos to kids

12:24.760 --> 12:25.760
out there.

12:25.760 --> 12:30.920
And unfortunately, you know, I guess it has been approved, so hoorah.

12:30.920 --> 12:31.920
By one part.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.200
Why by one branch or something, right?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.200
Yes.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.360
Itís been approved by the New York Assembly.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.120
This law sucks.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.640
And you know why it sucks?

12:39.640 --> 12:44.520
Because is this same rule being applied to theaters that sell tickets to underage folks

12:44.520 --> 12:46.680
trying to get an R-rated movie?

12:46.680 --> 12:48.680
Then this law is not fair.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.880
Thatís why this law sucks.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.360
Thatís all.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.880
Itís bullshit.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.280
Grand Staney is what it is.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.280
Itís stupid.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.280
Thatís right.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.280
Itís stupid.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.280
All right.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.640
Weíre going to get into, and actually Iím looking at some comments in the chat room

13:04.640 --> 13:05.640
here.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.840
Act Def says, ìLaw sucks in general.î Yes, sometimes.

13:08.840 --> 13:13.160
Rama says, ìUnless New York State does a lot of secret shopping and or undercover sting

13:13.160 --> 13:18.280
operations,î which they wonít, ìthis law will not fucking stick at all.î And Gerardimo

13:18.280 --> 13:22.340
says, ìAw, Iím a New York minor, but I only have a Wii, so Iím going to have a far hard

13:22.340 --> 13:24.160
time finding an M game.î

13:24.160 --> 13:26.960
Um, Scarface, Manhunt, Driver, um.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.440
Yeah, but donít buy Driver.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.080
Yeah, unless you want to laugh.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.080
All right.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.080
Itís the bad AI.

13:35.080 --> 13:40.780
Well, folks, itís about time that we play a little bit of our favorite game to play

13:40.780 --> 13:42.760

13:42.760 --> 13:50.400
Itís the Match Game, ladies and gentlemen, and weíre going to open up the phone lines

13:50.400 --> 13:52.040
right now to get a contestant.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.920
We have one contestant from the chat room, and we just need to get an opponent, so if

13:55.920 --> 14:01.720
youíd like to give us a call, weíll take the first call on our Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

14:01.720 --> 14:06.960
or our user name on Skype is ìOrange Lounge Radio.î You can call us either way.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.360
And first off, weíll go around and introduce the special guests that will be playing tonight.

14:10.360 --> 14:13.360
Loki, please help us introduce the guests tonight.

14:13.360 --> 14:17.840
All right, and guest number one, your name?

14:17.840 --> 14:37.240
Yes, I donít care where you came from.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.800
Where did you come from, Mielethauk?

14:39.800 --> 14:40.800
Galactica.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.800
Hold on.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.000
Weíve got a contestant call here.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Hold on.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Whoís this?

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Hi.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Itís Wonder Dog Harold.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Hi, Wonder Dog Harold.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
How are you?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Hey.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Iím fine.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
You win.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
You get to play match game tonight, okay?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Huzzah.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
All right, all right.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.720
So hold on the line while we introduce the rest of the panelists tonight, okay?

15:01.720 --> 15:05.860
By the way, tonight, speaking of panelists, tonightís edition of the match game here

15:05.860 --> 15:10.080
on Orange Lounge Radio, we had to do it tonight dedicated to Mr. Charles Nelson Reilly, who

15:10.080 --> 15:15.860
was from the 70s edition of the match game, which, you know, obviously we are blatantly

15:15.860 --> 15:17.880
ripping off the match game from the 70s.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.760
You see the reruns on game show networks.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.040
He passed away this week and was one of the main reasons to watch that show.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.040
He was awesome.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.000
So weíre dedicating this edition to him.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.080
So anyway, so yes, Rice Princess and Mielethauk are here.

15:29.080 --> 15:33.240
They are sacrificing some of their precious time away from watching Battlestar Galactica

15:33.240 --> 15:37.280
episodes back to back to back to be here, because you guys have watched, like, what,

15:37.280 --> 15:38.840
like seven episodes so far this weekend?

15:38.840 --> 15:39.840
How many?

15:39.840 --> 15:40.840
We have.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.840
Seven episodes?

15:41.840 --> 15:42.840
We have a lot.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.840
All right.

15:43.840 --> 15:44.840
We donít want to take up too much of your precious time.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.240
This is Loki.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.240
Yes.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.240
Iím here.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.120
I know, of course.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.120
And Dark Sakura.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.280
Roar.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.840
And me, because Iím awesome.

15:54.840 --> 15:55.840
All right.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.840
So you have five folks tonight.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.320
And Wonder Dog Haroldís on the phone.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.320
You still there?

15:59.320 --> 16:00.320
Yep.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.320
Good.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.520
And heís going to be playing against Hitstun from the chat room.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.440
Hitstun from the chat room won our drawing during the break.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.440
Okay.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.680
Now, Wonder Dog Harold, do you know how the game works?

16:08.680 --> 16:09.680
Yep.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
Okay.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.620
Weíre going to, for those that donít, Iíll just explain it again, weíre going to be

16:13.620 --> 16:15.320
asking some questions.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.800
And weíre going to put in the blanks, but thereís blanks at the end of them.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.580
And you are supposed to come up with what you believe belongs in the blank.

16:23.580 --> 16:27.280
And if you match with anybody in the studio, then you get a point.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.280
All right.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.840
So we only have three questions tonight, though.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.320
Itís a short game tonight.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.800
Are you ready to play?

16:33.800 --> 16:34.800
Yeah.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.800
All right.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.160
Are you ready to play, Wonder Dog Harold?

16:38.160 --> 16:39.160
Yep.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.160
All right.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.160
Here you go.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.160
Here is question number one.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.160
All right.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.320
Here it is.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.600
Rob just landed himself in big trouble.

16:48.600 --> 16:53.760
When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card

16:53.760 --> 16:55.520
was declined.

16:55.520 --> 17:00.720
Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, ìRob, we turned off your credit

17:00.720 --> 17:16.360
card because youíve been buying too much blank.î All our guests are thinking about

17:16.360 --> 17:17.360
their answers.

17:17.360 --> 17:18.640
Theyíre writing them down.

17:18.640 --> 17:24.280
ìRob, we turned off your credit card because youíve been buying too much blank.î Okay.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.840
All right.

17:26.840 --> 17:39.080
Iím waiting for the ñ okay, there we go.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.080
And all right.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.080
All right.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.560
You got an answer, Wonder Dog Harold?

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
You ready?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Heís still thinking.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.560
All right.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.560
While youíre thinking, all right.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
Here we go.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.360
Iíll read the question one more time, then weíre going to go to you for an answer.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.360
Here it is.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.840
ìRob just landed himself in big trouble.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.360
When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card

17:58.360 --> 17:59.740
was declined.

17:59.740 --> 18:02.520
Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, ìRob, we turned off your credit

18:02.520 --> 18:07.080
card because youíve been buying too much ñî What do you think, Wonder Dog Harold?

18:07.080 --> 18:08.080
Porn.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
Porn, says Wonder Dog Harold.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.480
Too much porn.

18:10.480 --> 18:16.640
Hitstun also said porn, so this isnít going to be a very exciting round because if anybody

18:16.640 --> 18:18.120
gets porn, they both get a point.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.120
Thatís all right.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.120
Letís see what our celebrity panel came up with.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.040
Weíll start with Rice Princess.

18:23.040 --> 18:30.240
Heís been buying too much ñ ìSilent, occupied Caprica.î Too much silent, occupied Caprica.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.160
Is that a match?

18:32.160 --> 18:33.560
No, that would not be a match.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.560
Is that a match?

18:34.560 --> 18:37.640
Thatís something from Battlestar Galactica, actually, and we are playing video game match

18:37.640 --> 18:38.640
game now.

18:38.640 --> 18:39.640
Oh.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.640
All right.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.640
Miklotov.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.720
Heís been buying too much ñ Because porn is such a totally video game-related

18:45.720 --> 18:46.720
thing.

18:46.720 --> 18:51.280
Heís been buying too much helo, which is like halo but helo.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.280
Helo.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.800
That would be porn for me.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.240
Another Battlestar Galactica reference.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.280
Thank you very much for that.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.280
Too much helo.

18:59.280 --> 19:03.560
Not a match, though, even if that is the object of Shaneís fantasies we donít need to hear

19:03.560 --> 19:04.560
about on the show.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.560
Loki.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.680
Heís been buying too much ñ Actraiser.

19:08.680 --> 19:09.680
Actraiser.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.680
Good guess.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.680
Good guess.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.160
Loved it so much, he had to buy it five times over.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.200
Yes, to put it in the top five somewhere.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
He bought it for all his friends.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.200
Actually, there you go.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.960
He filled up one whole page on his ñ Of Actraiser.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.960
Oh, I should do that.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.960
Dark Sakura.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
Heís been buying too much.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
Propel.

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
Propel.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960
I havenít used it in ages.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.960
I know.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
Propel.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.960
I actually drank some Propel today.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.960
Was it good?

19:29.960 --> 19:30.960
Mm-hmm.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
Wow, Rob.

19:31.960 --> 19:32.960
Itís like fitness water.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
Itís good.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
All right.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.480
I put ñ Rob, we turned off your credit card because youíve been buying too much candy

19:37.480 --> 19:38.920
because Iím fat.

19:38.920 --> 19:39.920
Candy.

19:39.920 --> 19:40.920
Sorry.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.080
There you go.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.080
So there it is.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.120
No matches for either contestant that round.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.120
Sorry to say.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.120
Sorry, Wonder Dog Herald.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
Aw.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.120
All right.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.520
That was ñ that was very emotive.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.520
I like that.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.520
All right, you ready?

19:55.520 --> 19:57.000
You ready to get some points on the second question?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Sure.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
All right.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Here we go.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.760
Thatís what I like, some excited contestants.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.160
Here we go.

20:06.160 --> 20:12.760
Question number two, Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort.

20:12.760 --> 20:13.760
Liar.

20:13.760 --> 20:16.160
But sheís been very ñ itís a game, Jamie.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.160
Play along.

20:17.160 --> 20:22.040
Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but sheís been very impressed with

20:22.040 --> 20:26.600
all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs lately because, you know,

20:26.600 --> 20:29.720
like they have the little coasters that have like Zelda pictures and stuff.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.200
Letís go to Kotaku or something.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.200
Youíll see it.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.880
Sheís been very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs

20:34.880 --> 20:35.880
lately.

20:35.880 --> 20:40.960
She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class when her first

20:40.960 --> 20:47.960
project she brought in was blank.

20:47.960 --> 20:53.160
She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class when for her

20:53.160 --> 20:56.320
first project she brought in blank.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.040
All right, ding.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.040
Ding.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.040
Ding.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.040
All right.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.040
All right.

21:04.040 --> 21:14.320
Iím just waiting for our chat room player, and hopefully our phone player has thought

21:14.320 --> 21:16.720
of an answer too.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.520
The chat room is helping out.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.720
All right.

21:22.720 --> 21:28.080
Wow, one of these answers is an incredibly poor taste.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.720
All right.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.840
I usually are though.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.840
All right, here we go.

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
Here we go.

21:34.840 --> 21:35.840
Is everybody dinged?

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
All right.

21:36.840 --> 21:37.840
Ding.

21:37.840 --> 21:38.840
All right, here we go.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.840
Here we go.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.480
Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but sheís been very impressed with

21:43.480 --> 21:46.360
all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs lately.

21:46.360 --> 21:50.720
She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class for when her

21:50.720 --> 21:54.920
first project she brought inóWonder Dog Harold?

21:54.920 --> 21:56.920
A sweater with hard gay on it.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.840
A sweater with hard gay on it.

21:58.840 --> 21:59.840
Okay, good.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.520
Heís been paying attention to the show because Jamieís been watching hard gay.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.320
Okay, good, good answer, but weíll see if it matches.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.640
Hitstun said a shotgun.

22:07.640 --> 22:10.800
She brought in a shotgun, which might beó

22:10.800 --> 22:11.800
Too soon.

22:11.800 --> 22:12.800
Too soon.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.520
A little bit, but all right, thatís the answer.

22:14.520 --> 22:18.400
All right, Rice Princess, she brought in?

22:18.400 --> 22:22.400
She brought in a Cylon Occupied Caprica.

22:22.400 --> 22:31.140
Unfortunately, Cylon Occupied Caprica is not a match and is still a Battlestar Galactica

22:31.140 --> 22:32.680
reference Rice Princess.

22:32.680 --> 22:37.520
We are playing video gameóCandy is not video games either, so shut up.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.120
Nintendoís cereal was candy.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.480
Thereís a Battlestar game coming out, so take that.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.920
Will it have Cylon Occupied Caprica in it?

22:44.920 --> 22:45.920
Probably.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
All right, here it is.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.920
For her first project, she brought inóHelo.

22:48.920 --> 22:57.240
Guys, you know what your next answers have to be, right?

22:57.240 --> 23:00.800
Possibly.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.120
This by the way will be the last appearance of Rice Princess and Miklótov on our show.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.120
Say goodbye, folks.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.120
Itís been fun.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.640
Itís been a fun five years.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.320
Itís been swell, but the swellingís gone down.

23:11.320 --> 23:15.680
All right, Loki, she brought in?

23:15.680 --> 23:18.800
The corpse of Charles Nelson Riley.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.800
Too soon.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.480
Too soon.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.020
In my refrigerator, hi.

23:25.020 --> 23:29.280
She brought in the corpse of Charles Nelson Riley to her knitting class?

23:29.280 --> 23:30.580
Thatís horrible.

23:30.580 --> 23:36.320
She needed a reference, a lifelike reference of knitting his corpse.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.000
Dark Sakura, she brought in?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.600
A Glock 37.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.600
A Glock 37?

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
Too soon.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Itís a gun.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
Donít you watch the news?

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
No.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.880
You are not supposed to make guns at college jokes.

23:47.880 --> 23:48.880
Itís not cool.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.640
If you donít make fun of it, how will you ever recover?

23:51.640 --> 23:52.640
All right, true.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.000
Hey, itís a half of a match, though.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.640
Is a Glock 37 a shotgun?

23:55.640 --> 23:56.640
I donít think so.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.640
No, but itís a firearm, so it gets to have a point.

23:59.640 --> 24:05.920
No, porn and helo are not a match, neither is shotgun and whatever Jamie said.

24:05.920 --> 24:06.920
All right.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.320
But itís a powerful gun.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.200
GS 191 says, does this mean I can call Loki a nappy-headed hoe, then?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.080
I donít know, maybe.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.080
He kind of is.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.080
My hair is not nappy.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
Anyway.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.080
Dude, the chat room calls for half a point.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.080
All right.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.080
No, thatís nice for the chat room, too bad itís not their game.

24:25.080 --> 24:31.360
All right, anyway, I said that she brought in, because it was a knitting class, she brought

24:31.360 --> 24:34.920
in a quilt with Pyramid Head raping a corpse.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.960
All right.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.960
And it actually wasÖ

24:37.960 --> 24:40.040
Of course, I know you donít make quilts in knitting class.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.040
You donít knit a quilt.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.680
Thatís why they kicked her out, stupid.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.960
Well, my other answer was going to be bloody steel needles.

24:46.960 --> 24:51.760
Actually, Pyramid Head was raping Charles Nelson Rileyís corpse, so go figure.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.980
With a shotgun.

24:53.980 --> 24:55.520
That would not be attractive.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.080
That would be attractive, Rob.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.160
So Wonder Dog Harold, Iím very sorry, you still have a zero.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.160
Ow!

25:02.160 --> 25:03.160
Shit!

25:03.160 --> 25:04.960
That hurt!

25:04.960 --> 25:06.560
And Dark Soccer just injured herself.

25:06.560 --> 25:07.560
So at least you get that.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.480
No, I injured my laptop and indirectly injured myself.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.480
All right.

25:10.480 --> 25:14.720
Wonder Dog Harold, are you going to get a point on this last one?

25:14.720 --> 25:15.720
At least one.

25:15.720 --> 25:16.720
All right, at least one.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.760
Here we go.

25:18.760 --> 25:22.000
Here it is, the last question, folks.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.880
Piggy was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fauna Mae.

25:26.880 --> 25:30.680
He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

25:30.680 --> 25:33.560
He said to himself, ìThatís it.

25:33.560 --> 25:43.960
Next year Iím coming dressed as blank.î

25:43.960 --> 25:47.000
He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.720
He said to himself, ìThatís it.

25:48.720 --> 26:06.840
Next year Iím coming dressed as blank.î

26:06.840 --> 26:10.960
No extra fur, youíre too late, you canít play now.

26:10.960 --> 26:11.960
I want to ding.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.960
I want to do a bonus point.

26:13.960 --> 26:17.400
You canít do a bonus point.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.040
Fine, extra fur wants to be a bonus point.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.040
Fine.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.040
All right, yeah, I think we got an answer.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.200
All right, there we go.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.160
All right, thereís the end of the music.

26:28.160 --> 26:30.600
All right, here we go.

26:30.600 --> 26:33.920
Loki was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fauna Mae.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.200
He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.740
He said to himself, ìThatís it.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.600
Next year Iím coming dressed asî.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
Wonder Dog Harold?

26:40.600 --> 26:41.600
Helo?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
Helo!

26:42.600 --> 26:47.680
Okay, all right, so I see the tactic youíre taking here.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.560
All right, well, letís see if itís a match.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
Rice Princess.

26:50.560 --> 26:53.120
Wait, I have the microphone, and whoís the other guy who needs to take it?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.120
Oh, Iím sorry.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.120
Oh, yeah, thatís right.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.120
Hitstun, sorry.

26:56.120 --> 27:01.160
Hitstun said, ìIím coming dressed as missworld96nude.î

27:01.160 --> 27:02.160
Good answer, good answer.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.160
All right, letís see.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.160
Sure.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.160
So we have Helo and missworld96nude.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.160
Letís start.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.800
Rice Princess was number one, though, so.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.800
I grabbed the microphone.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.440
Fine, Mieglotov, what was your answer?

27:11.440 --> 27:16.000
My answer, a silent, occupied Caprica.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.920
Are you doing this just to screw with our?

27:17.920 --> 27:20.920
No, we had already planned that out, so.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.920
Rice Princess, what did you say?

27:23.920 --> 27:28.720
Next year Iím coming dressed as?

27:28.720 --> 27:29.720
Answer

27:29.720 --> 27:30.720
Gata.

27:30.720 --> 27:31.720
Gata?

27:31.720 --> 27:32.720
Gata.

27:32.720 --> 27:37.560
Heís in the CIC in Battlestar.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.800
Heís Lieutenant Gata.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.040
You guys totally screwed Wonder Dog Harold out of a point.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.800
I had already planned mine, so.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.000
Wonder Dog Harold, would you care to yell at our celebrities?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
No.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.640
Somebody could still say Helo.

27:49.640 --> 27:50.640
All right, here we go.

27:50.640 --> 27:51.640
Thereís three of you guys left.

27:51.640 --> 27:52.640
All right, yeah, thatís true.

27:52.640 --> 27:53.640
Somebody could still say Helo.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.320
Loki, he decided to come dressed as?

27:56.320 --> 27:59.480
I was just going to say it myself.

27:59.480 --> 28:00.740
I donít cosplay.

28:00.740 --> 28:02.640
Fuck this shit.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.040
I donít cosplay.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.040
Fuck this shit.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.040
Itís not a match.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.040
Iím sorry to say.

28:07.040 --> 28:09.040
Dark Sakura, heís going to come dressed as?

28:09.040 --> 28:11.040
Hadouge.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.920
Hadouge.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.160
Also not a match.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.040
And I said, next year Iím coming dressed as?

28:17.040 --> 28:18.040
Helo, obvious.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.040
Tingle.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.000
Helo, heís coming dressed as Tingle.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.960
For finally the OLR fans could be happy.

28:24.960 --> 28:25.960
And fine.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.520
Extrovert wants a bonus point.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.040
Letís see if thereís a match.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.800
You could decide the game right here.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.560
Iím going to come dressed as?

28:32.560 --> 28:38.160
I was going to say Hot Dog from, oh, from Battlestar Galactica.

28:38.160 --> 28:46.960
I fucking hate this show.

28:46.960 --> 28:55.080
So there it is, unfortunately nobody won, hitstun got zero, and Wonder Dog Harold, Iím

28:55.080 --> 28:56.920
sorry to say you got zero as well.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.840
So you have to give us money.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.000
Can I say something?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Yes.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.360
My dogís been lost for two days and they found her.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.360
In one piece?

29:05.360 --> 29:06.360
Yes.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.360
Good.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.640
Iím glad the bitch is okay.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.360
I was really depressed for two days.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.360
Alright.

29:14.360 --> 29:19.280
Um, Wonder Dog Harold, as a consolation prize, Iíll let you plug any website or something

29:19.280 --> 29:21.880
you want to give a plug to here on air.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.480
Um, nope.

29:23.480 --> 29:29.360
Youíre a man of many words, Wonder Dog Harold, I appreciate it.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.360
Thank you for calling in and being a contestant tonight.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.360
Alrighty.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.360
Alright, take care.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.360
Bye-bye.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.360
Bye.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.360
Bye.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.360
That was great.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.360
We need to have you on the show more often.

29:40.360 --> 29:44.600
I think Wonder Dog Harold said like ten words, itís like when Megalodon gets on the show,

29:44.600 --> 29:45.600
he says ten words the entire show.

29:45.600 --> 29:49.920
You need to be in studio and weíll see if you speak more.

29:49.920 --> 29:50.920
Alright.

29:50.920 --> 29:56.600
Alright, so we have zero, zero, everybody is a loser.

29:56.600 --> 30:00.000
Hitstun says the chat failed me, theyíre fired.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.920
Hitstun says, you know, I can challenge Wonder Dog Harold at Tetris DS or Mario Kart or something.

30:04.920 --> 30:08.440
I know the chat room was screaming Tingle, it would have been a point.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.720
Alright, thatís it for Match Game.

30:10.720 --> 30:15.400
And at this point I will now kick out all of the guests because they obviously need

30:15.400 --> 30:16.400
to go watch Battlestar Galactica.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.800
Do you want some ice cream though?

30:18.800 --> 30:19.800
I want ice cream.

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
Are you guys going to get ice cream?

30:20.800 --> 30:21.800
Get milkshakes.

30:21.800 --> 30:22.800
No.

30:22.800 --> 30:23.800
I donít want to get ice cream.

30:23.800 --> 30:24.800
You guys get ice cream.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.800
You can get me a milkshake.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.200
Or we can go get ice cream and not bring any back.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.740
How about this, Iíll let, okay, weíll let you guys take over the afterbirth while we

30:31.740 --> 30:32.740
go get ice cream.

30:32.740 --> 30:37.880
Can we make our own cage match?

30:37.880 --> 30:38.880
Yeah, can you?

30:38.880 --> 30:39.880
No, I donít think so.

30:39.880 --> 30:40.880
Damn it.

30:40.880 --> 30:41.880
I put in an awesome song.

30:41.880 --> 30:42.880
Well, think about it.

30:42.880 --> 30:43.880
Alright.

30:43.880 --> 30:44.880
Think about it and come get back to me.

30:44.880 --> 30:45.880
Weíll get back to you.

30:45.880 --> 30:46.880
Alright.

30:46.880 --> 30:50.440
Alright, I know, thereís going to be a theme from Battlestar Galactica.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.600
You can let me do it and itíll all be Doctor Who.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.680
Alright, well, tonightís Match Game was a colossal failure.

30:55.680 --> 30:59.800
Doctor Who is cooler than Battlestar Galactica.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.480
I donít know, I donít know about that.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.480
It is a pretty good show.

31:02.480 --> 31:03.480
Donít egg them on.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.480
Yeah, seriously.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.480
Donít encourage them.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.480
Alright, letís talk about porn.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.480
Yay!

31:08.480 --> 31:10.160
Can I get a yay for porn?

31:10.160 --> 31:11.160
Yay!

31:11.160 --> 31:12.160
Yay!

31:12.160 --> 31:14.520
Well, actually this isnít real porn, but itís Leisure Suit Larry, which is kind of

31:14.520 --> 31:18.600
like, you know, it was kind of like the Cinemax of gaming back in the day.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.680
It was like, you know, you might see a titty if you freeze frame once in a while.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.040
Well, Leisure Suit Larry is coming to mobile platforms.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.180
Thatís right.

31:26.180 --> 31:29.080
You can see some pixelated boobies.

31:29.080 --> 31:33.320
God For Sale, which was the seventh game in the Leisure Suit Larry series, is coming to

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
cell phones.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.320
Go figure.

31:35.320 --> 31:39.160
Itís coming from Vivendi Games Mobile, and itís coming out in September.

31:39.160 --> 31:42.840
But if youíre in Europe, youíre getting it first, you get it in June.

31:42.840 --> 31:47.280
Quote from this one, President of Vivendi Games Mobile, Paul Maglione, quote, ìLarry

31:47.280 --> 31:50.560
fans worldwide have a strong allegiance to the classic Leisure Suit Larry adventure game

31:50.560 --> 31:51.560
format.

31:51.560 --> 31:54.040
We are delighted to be doing just that with the mobile version.

31:54.040 --> 31:58.300
Weíve kept the iconic Larry humor and attitude intact while adapting the graphics, language

31:58.300 --> 32:04.040
and controls for a mass market global audience.î So there you go, some pixelated JavaScript

32:04.040 --> 32:06.840
titty coming to a cell phone near you.

32:06.840 --> 32:07.840
Yay.

32:07.840 --> 32:14.720
And if you want your titties to be more realistic, then Dead or Alive the movie is coming out

32:14.720 --> 32:24.740
June 15th, and well, itís going to be about as deep as Mortal Kombat the movie, probably

32:24.740 --> 32:32.800
less deep, but it will be coming out to theaters, and there will be lots of chicks fighting,

32:32.800 --> 32:37.360
and I know thereís one scene with a chick fighting topless, but of course, you know,

32:37.360 --> 32:38.360
this isó

32:38.360 --> 32:41.680
Is this because youíve already watched the whole movie on Google video when it was out

32:41.680 --> 32:42.680
a while ago?

32:42.680 --> 32:46.720
No, but I downloaded the PSP version of it off of Google video.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.360
Thatís good.

32:48.360 --> 32:59.080
Well, speaking of things that have no depth, SingStar 90s isóoh, my God, why are people

32:59.080 --> 33:00.080
still playingó

33:00.080 --> 33:03.200
You know what, the SingStar games donít look that bad.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.200
I actuallyó

33:04.200 --> 33:05.200
Oh, I played it at E3.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.200
Yeah.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.520
And I had to do Motorhead with some guy.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.920
Iím more excitedóheaven forbid Iím saying Iím excited about a PlayStation 3 game, but

33:13.920 --> 33:16.000
I think SingStar will be better on the PlayStation 3.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.360
We can downloadólike, so that way you donít have all these frickiní CD expansion packs,

33:20.360 --> 33:21.360
right?

33:21.360 --> 33:22.800
Well, thank you for reading my story for me.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.880
Oh, no, I havenít said anything about what it is.

33:24.880 --> 33:30.680
Well, what I was going to say is that there actually is some speculation that for the

33:30.680 --> 33:37.120
PS3 SingStar, there would be some more data for download via the download service, but

33:37.120 --> 33:45.000
actually SingStar 90s isóactually was announced for New Zealand stores for August 3rd, soó

33:45.000 --> 33:46.000
Yeah.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
What kind of songs are in this game?

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Is there a song list?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Thereís a gallery.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.760
Oh, hereís a song list.

33:52.760 --> 33:58.360
Never Ever, All Saints, Barbie Girl, Love Shack, One Week, Achy Breaky Heart, with a

33:58.360 --> 33:59.880
big fat typo on the page.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.880
This game already fails.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.880
Unbelievable.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.320
Hey, that was a good song.

34:04.320 --> 34:05.800
Here Comes the Hot Stepper.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.640
It has Stay on it.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.640
Really?

34:08.640 --> 34:09.640
By Shakespeareís Sister?

34:09.640 --> 34:10.640
No, Lisa Loeb.

34:10.640 --> 34:11.640
Oh, dammit.

34:11.640 --> 34:15.800
You Canít Touch This, Bitch, which I donít like that song at all.

34:15.800 --> 34:20.080
Moving On Up, Torn, Step byóoh, New Kids on the Block is on it.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.080
Thatís cool.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.080
This game might be interesting.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.320
Dude, Where the Wild Roses Go.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.560
I fucking love that song.

34:24.560 --> 34:25.920
Is that the Nick Cave song?

34:25.920 --> 34:26.920
And Kylie.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
Yes.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.920
Wow, thatís kind of cool.

34:28.920 --> 34:29.920
It has Poison on it.

34:29.920 --> 34:30.920
Wannabe.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.640
I wonder if that game will come out in the US with that.

34:33.640 --> 34:34.640
Dude, Radiohead!

34:34.640 --> 34:36.640
Thatís kind of neat.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.640
R.E.M.

34:37.640 --> 34:41.200
It has Savage Garden, Kiss from a Rose, Baby Got Back.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.800
Thatís funny.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.040
Um, yeah, Zombies on it.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.040
Zombies, Zombies.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.040
Dude, heís got the cure.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.040
Iím getting this game.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.040
Zombies, Zombies, Zombies.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.040
Okay, good.

34:50.040 --> 34:56.240
Uh, letís see, uh, Black Boy in our chatroom says, Sing Star needs more Bjork.

34:56.240 --> 34:57.240
I agree.

34:57.240 --> 35:04.640
Iím a tree that grows hollow, one for it at your back.

35:04.640 --> 35:10.040
See, I do a great impression, donít I?

35:10.040 --> 35:11.880
What was Margaret Cho's impersonation?

35:11.880 --> 35:17.560
Iím sorry that I tried to eat your head.

35:17.560 --> 35:21.240
By the way, thereís this YouTube somewhere of, and I know we talked about it on the show

35:21.240 --> 35:24.640
before, but itís worth bringing up again, itís that funny, where somebody took, because

35:24.640 --> 35:29.720
you know Bjork one time beat the crap out of some reporter in an airport in Thailand?

35:29.720 --> 35:33.520
Well somebody put Street Fighter graphics and music over it and itís really funny,

35:33.520 --> 35:34.520
itís on YouTube somewhere.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.400
Iím sure one of the chatters will dig it up somewhere.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.720
So there it goes.

35:40.720 --> 35:45.520
Something else you can find on the internet is a role in a movie!

35:45.520 --> 35:47.160
Amazing!

35:47.160 --> 35:50.960
And uh, but I donít know if you really want to be in this movie, because itís an UE Bowl

35:50.960 --> 35:51.960
movie.

35:51.960 --> 35:58.080
Uh, heís actually auctioning off a role on eBay for a role in Far Cry.

35:58.080 --> 36:06.040
The bidding started at 2,498 Euros, which would translate to about $3,360 US.

36:06.040 --> 36:11.760
And the winner would get five days on the set of the movie, and uh, unfortunately though,

36:11.760 --> 36:15.280
they would have to cover the flight and the hotel.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.800
So go figure that nobody bid on it!

36:17.800 --> 36:18.800
Interesting.

36:18.800 --> 36:23.440
If I had the money, Iíd do it.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.440
Why?

36:24.440 --> 36:25.440
Because.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.040
Because youíre like, ìHey, look at that!

36:27.040 --> 36:32.240
I was in that crappy movie!î Then I could say, ìI was in the movie and it fucking sucked!î

36:32.240 --> 36:36.480
The official eBay page is all in German, so itís kind of hard for me to make out, but

36:36.480 --> 36:37.480
it didnít sell.

36:37.480 --> 36:39.920
It doesnít look like it sold.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.280
Yeah, he sucks.

36:42.280 --> 36:46.080
Thank you, Tigerclaw, for finding the Bjork Street Fighter video.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.280
Awesome.

36:47.280 --> 36:52.920
Alright, well, uh, stories about UE Bowl make us very angry, so you know what that means,

36:52.920 --> 36:53.920
boys and girls?

36:53.920 --> 37:09.880
Itís time for the FUs of the Week.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.720
Dark Sakura, start us off.

37:11.720 --> 37:14.540
What makes me angry?

37:14.540 --> 37:21.000
What makes me angry is the check engine light coming on on my car, um, because, well, we

37:21.000 --> 37:25.720
checked the, um, all the emissions, everything was clean, there was no problem with any of

37:25.720 --> 37:30.000
that, so I think it just needs to spark plugs, but other than that, it was just really aggravating.

37:30.000 --> 37:36.520
Oh, and one other thing, FU to Office Drama.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.920
And new leather smell on my massage table.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.520
Loki, any FUs of the Week?

37:41.520 --> 37:50.760
Uh, yeah, FU to, um, the key flash component to VGA thing Iíve got, because it doesnít

37:50.760 --> 37:57.040
work like it should, because, you know, my picture shouldnít be flashing on and off

37:57.040 --> 38:01.960
on the screen, that would probably mean itís not working, so, fuck them, and fuck you for

38:01.960 --> 38:04.560
wasting $50 of my money.

38:04.560 --> 38:09.560
Um, my FU of the Week goes to the fact that Iím flying out to the East Coast in 48 hours,

38:09.560 --> 38:15.320
and I havenít done any packing yet, so FU to myself for not packing yet.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.200
Maybe after tonightís show, weíll see.

38:18.200 --> 38:22.200
All right, letís get back into some gaming news.

38:22.200 --> 38:28.720
Well, back to rumors and speculation.

38:28.720 --> 38:36.720
There actually was a little bit from Famitsu announcing that several Metal Gear Solid 20th

38:36.720 --> 38:42.800
Anniversary titles were supposed to be out, so theyíve listed for the 26th of July Metal

38:42.800 --> 38:53.440
Gear Solid Collection for PlayStation, PS2, and PSP, also Metal Gear Solid 3 on PS2, Metal

38:53.440 --> 38:57.200
Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear Solid 2, did I just say that?

38:57.200 --> 38:59.800
They listed it twice.

38:59.800 --> 39:06.480
There also is Metal Gear Solid for PlayStation and Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear

39:06.480 --> 39:10.280
Solid Portable Ops for PSP re-releases, I guess.

39:10.280 --> 39:16.080
Like, yay, you can just go to your used video game store and get them.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.960
Are they going to re-do graphics or anything?

39:17.960 --> 39:19.520
It doesnít say anything.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.520
Lame.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.880
So itís just basically repackaged, re-priced.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.880
It doesnít say anything.

39:23.880 --> 39:24.880
Whoopee!

39:24.880 --> 39:29.800
Well, I mean, given anything released in Japan, um, thereís always the possibility of having

39:29.800 --> 39:35.120
limited edition stuff that comes with, you know, like forks and plates and things, and

39:35.120 --> 39:38.400
donít laugh because Iíve bought a video game that came with a fork and a plate and

39:38.400 --> 39:40.120
a clock and a pillowcase.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.120
What happened to the dish and the spoon?

39:41.120 --> 39:42.120
Did they run away together?

39:42.120 --> 39:43.440
It had a dish and a spoon with it.

39:43.440 --> 39:47.720
It was that Cardcaptor Soccer game that came out on Dreamcast.

39:47.720 --> 39:52.400
So I wouldnít discount the fact that, you know, something else might come out with it

39:52.400 --> 39:57.520
to make it all kind of, ooh, special, but it doesnít say anything yet.

39:57.520 --> 40:01.400
So Iím not going to put any stock into it until I get something official.

40:01.400 --> 40:06.360
Well, something coming soon, or at least a rumor to be coming soon.

40:06.360 --> 40:10.040
Tony Erickson, of course, the rumorís been going around saying that thereís going to

40:10.040 --> 40:12.640
be a PSP phone coming soon.

40:12.640 --> 40:18.920
Well, apparently thereís been a patent thatís been spotted on the US patent website, and

40:18.920 --> 40:24.280
thereís some pretty hard evidence there showing kind of a prototype of something that looks

40:24.280 --> 40:29.360
like a very thick phone thatís going to have a rotatable screen, almost looks like a PSP,

40:29.360 --> 40:31.800
just a little bit thicker.

40:31.800 --> 40:35.720
Very interesting, though, kind of the same stuff I think we saw before when they were

40:35.720 --> 40:41.440
showing off like the mobile Nintendo games and stuff, you know, where you can pause the

40:41.440 --> 40:44.960
game when you get a call and that kind of stuff.

40:44.960 --> 40:45.960
I donít know.

40:45.960 --> 40:53.400
Obviously no firm plans have been made yet, but something thatís coming soon, Iím guessing.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.040
This thing looks stupid.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.360
It makes me think of the great phone taco.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.360
The N-Gage?

40:59.360 --> 41:00.360
The N-Gage.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.360
I had a phone taco.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.360
I donít getó

41:02.360 --> 41:03.360
What?

41:03.360 --> 41:04.360
You had an N-Gage?

41:04.360 --> 41:05.360
I told you I had one.

41:05.360 --> 41:06.360
It was free.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.360
Loser.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.720
It was free, and we gave it away.

41:09.720 --> 41:10.720
Cheap loser.

41:10.720 --> 41:14.920
Oh, okay, so thatís what it would be.

41:14.920 --> 41:15.920
That makes more sense.

41:15.920 --> 41:21.100
It looks like what would happen is youíd actuallyóyouíd have your kind of directional

41:21.100 --> 41:26.640
button and stuff like youíd normally have on a phone, and then that whole screen would

41:26.640 --> 41:30.640
flip around and then you would have kind of like a PSP looking thing.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.640
Itís neat.

41:31.640 --> 41:34.280
I donít know if that would work very well.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.720
It looks unwieldy and kind of crappy like the Blackberries do.

41:37.720 --> 41:40.000
I donít know.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.640
Just you know, PSPs arenít that expensive.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.280
Just stick with the PSP.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.680
Turn the PSP into a phone.

41:44.680 --> 41:45.680
There you go.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.600
How about get a phone, get a PSP.

41:48.600 --> 41:53.680
I would rather have a phone that I can do two things on.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.680
Number one, call people.

41:54.680 --> 41:55.680
Number two, text message.

41:55.680 --> 41:56.680
Thatís frickiní it.

41:56.680 --> 42:02.200
Thatís why I paid 30 bucks for my phone, and I have a nice phone, but if I want to

42:02.200 --> 42:06.320
play a video game, then Iíll just get something thatís dedicated to video games.

42:06.320 --> 42:09.880
I can take pictures with my phone, which is fine because I have a camera and all, but

42:09.880 --> 42:13.200
sometimes you can take pictures with your camera phone when people donít know it.

42:13.200 --> 42:16.040
Okay, that would be a number three.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.040
That would be a number three.

42:17.040 --> 42:23.200
But seriously, this iPhone crap and this PSP phone crap, why donít you just get a PSP

42:23.200 --> 42:25.680
or get an iPod?

42:25.680 --> 42:26.680
How hard is it?

42:26.680 --> 42:27.920
PSPs are pretty large too.

42:27.920 --> 42:29.920
I wouldnít really want to use it as a phone.

42:29.920 --> 42:35.240
Now if somebody gave me an iPhone, I wouldnít disagree, or if I got a big fat discount on

42:35.240 --> 42:38.920
one, I wouldnít disagree, but it was not something that I think is worth 600 bucks

42:38.920 --> 42:43.000
for, and neither would this PSP phone thing be.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.160
I have a phone that works, and I have one PSP, and I have a bunch of DSís.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.360
You could probably just play whatever.

42:49.360 --> 42:53.680
You could probably buy a pretty nice phone for $600, not Apple brand.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.240
Iíd like to think my phone was pretty nice.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.920
It was only 200 bucks a year ago.

42:57.920 --> 43:04.640
I could buy a full GPS system with built-in headphones to talk to anybody in the world

43:04.640 --> 43:07.400
for enough money, but why would I want to do that?

43:07.400 --> 43:09.060
I have my phone.

43:09.060 --> 43:10.400
I think that all of this is ridiculous.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.820
Itís just because people are tech addicts and need to have something that does more

43:14.820 --> 43:16.440
than it needs to do.

43:16.440 --> 43:22.400
All right, well on that PSP, you could play this.

43:22.400 --> 43:27.140
Also being reported in Famitsu is that a new version of Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins is

43:27.140 --> 43:28.560
coming out for the PSP.

43:28.560 --> 43:32.560
Itís coming out in Japan, and theyíre redoing it.

43:32.560 --> 43:36.760
Itís going to be making the game a little closer to its arcade roots.

43:36.760 --> 43:41.140
The number of continues is going to be limited, and players will be forced to complete the

43:41.140 --> 43:45.000
game twice before seeing the ending.

43:45.000 --> 43:49.120
In other words, theyíve made this game even harder than it was before.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.120
Wow.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.720
It was pretty hard before.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.720
So there you have it.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.440
Ghosts and Goblins, it better be hard.

43:55.440 --> 43:58.600
So August 2nd is the day the game is coming out.

43:58.600 --> 44:03.040
No import plans announced yet for the game to come out in North America, but we can all

44:03.040 --> 44:06.920
hold our breath, and maybe weíll get it.

44:06.920 --> 44:09.960
But Iím sure itíll be dumbed down and made easy, just like most of the games they bring

44:09.960 --> 44:10.960
over from Japan.

44:10.960 --> 44:11.960
Who knows?

44:11.960 --> 44:12.960
Maybe weíll die first.

44:12.960 --> 44:13.960
All right.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.960
One more story, then weíre going to get to our Skype line.

44:16.960 --> 44:22.260
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can call us, Orange Lounge Radio is

44:22.260 --> 44:23.260
our user name.

44:23.260 --> 44:24.260
Iím sorry, two more stories.

44:24.260 --> 44:27.280
Orange Lounge Radio is our user name on Skype.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.280
Two more stories.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.280
My bad.

44:29.280 --> 44:39.200
Well, at any rate, the ñ you remember the whole Second Life exploitation that was going

44:39.200 --> 44:40.200
on?

44:40.200 --> 44:42.080
Didnít we cover that last week?

44:42.080 --> 44:43.080
Did it involve cock-throwing?

44:43.080 --> 44:44.080
No.

44:44.080 --> 44:54.160
Well, at any rate, a Pennsylvania attorney is taking Linden Labs to court because theyíre

44:54.160 --> 45:01.640
ñ sheís saying that they illegally took away the items that were supposed to have

45:01.640 --> 45:06.400
been acquired during ñ let me see the quote ñ allegedly acquired using an exploit by

45:06.400 --> 45:08.920
an SL user.

45:08.920 --> 45:17.120
He was banned, lost everything, and the court actually is denying the request to dismiss

45:17.120 --> 45:18.120
the case.

45:18.120 --> 45:19.840
Theyíve denied it twice.

45:19.840 --> 45:24.480
Thereís actually a big quote on here that says, ìThe case will still need to play out

45:24.480 --> 45:29.760
and only concerns the sum of $8,000.00, however, it appears that greater scrutiny and enforcement

45:29.760 --> 45:34.480
of commerce within Second Life and other virtual worlds is possible and may be necessary.

45:34.480 --> 45:39.640
The commerce, largely characterized by pyramid schemes, faulty valuations, and unreal exchange

45:39.640 --> 45:43.520
rates could be subject to real-world law.î So ñ

45:43.520 --> 45:46.600
Thatís what he made, Third Life.

45:46.600 --> 45:47.920
Yeah, for people who donít want to ñ

45:47.920 --> 45:49.880
Second Life is too real for you.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.320
Go to Third Life.

45:51.320 --> 45:56.000
So if someone steals all my equipment in World of Warcraft, I can sue them over it?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.760
Thatíll be kind of cool, I guess.

45:58.760 --> 45:59.760
Maybe.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.760
Interesting.

46:00.760 --> 46:07.400
Iím suing you for vandalizing my building by throwing cocks at it.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.400
Damn you.

46:08.400 --> 46:09.700
Damn you to hell.

46:09.700 --> 46:14.440
If someone threw cocks at me, Iíd sue them.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.840
Iím thinking I should sue these guys.

46:16.840 --> 46:21.200
Theyíre masters.

46:21.200 --> 46:25.920
They never seem to fail me when it comes to thinking up video game ideas.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.600
Theyíre creating Dirty Dancing, the video game.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.280
Yes, thatís right, Dirty Dancing.

46:32.280 --> 46:38.560
Such a wonderful game, and I donít know what the hell they could be doing with this.

46:38.560 --> 46:49.520
Great idea if they pull it off, but I really wish they put this baby in the corner.

46:49.520 --> 46:53.260
But apparently it says, ìWorking alongside a team at Kellermanís Resort, play through

46:53.260 --> 46:59.240
a fantastic variety of fun mini-games, earned camp dollars to purchase Dirty Dancing memorabilia,

46:59.240 --> 47:04.280
cabin furnishings, and all-important dance lessons with Johnny and Penny.

47:04.280 --> 47:08.640
How will you fare in the end of the season dance contest?î

47:08.640 --> 47:12.160
Didnít they already try bringing back the Dirty Dancing franchise with that Havana Nights

47:12.160 --> 47:13.680
movie or whatever it was that tanked?

47:13.680 --> 47:17.480
I donít know if it tanked, but yeah.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.200
I agree with Wonder Dog Harold.

47:19.200 --> 47:25.200
Wonder Dog Harold says, ìI want Mannequin, the video game.î Hell yeah.

47:25.200 --> 47:28.280
With that one guy with the glasses, what the hell was his name?

47:28.280 --> 47:34.400
The really flamey guy in the movie that was like the assistóoh, God, I know somebodyís

47:34.400 --> 47:35.400
going to yell it in chat.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.400
I know it.

47:36.400 --> 47:40.240
Thatís what I want to see, Mannequin, the video game.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.240
Thatís great.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.240
All right.

47:42.240 --> 47:44.120
Would you play Dirty Dancing, the video game?

47:44.120 --> 47:47.120
Maybe this is what happened to X-Tango.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.120
I donít know.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.120
I want X-Tango.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.120
Would you play Dirty Dancing, the game, Darzagra?

47:52.120 --> 47:53.120
No.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.120
All right.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.120
It was Meshach Taylor.

47:55.120 --> 47:57.320
Yeah, that was theóHollywood was his name.

47:57.320 --> 47:58.320
Thank you.

47:58.320 --> 48:01.240
Thank God his name was Hollywood.

48:01.240 --> 48:02.240
Thank you, Black Boy.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.240
All right.

48:03.240 --> 48:05.680
Letís get to the Skype line, shall we?

48:05.680 --> 48:11.800
If youíd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge

48:11.800 --> 48:12.800
Radio.

48:12.800 --> 48:18.440
The phones are now open for business, so give us a call.

48:18.440 --> 48:19.560
Weíll just sit here and wait.

48:19.560 --> 48:20.560
Okay, great.

48:20.560 --> 48:21.560
We got some calls coming in already.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.440
Thereís a little bit of a delay, so it takes a minute.

48:23.440 --> 48:24.440
Hi.

48:24.440 --> 48:25.440
Youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

48:25.440 --> 48:26.440
Whoís this?

48:26.440 --> 48:27.440
Yeah, you already know.

48:27.440 --> 48:28.440
Itís Legend of Zaku.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.440
Hey, Zaku.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.440
How you doing?

48:30.440 --> 48:33.920
What do you think aboutónow, I know youíre into cell phone games.

48:33.920 --> 48:37.240
What do you think about Leisure Suit Larry on the mobile phones?

48:37.240 --> 48:44.080
I havenít seen it yet, but I would assume it has to be text and graphics-based, where

48:44.080 --> 48:52.560
you just have toóbasically, text and images, itís basically the whole premise of cell

48:52.560 --> 48:58.520
phone games just to garner the casual gamerís attention, but yeah, if it works out, thatís

48:58.520 --> 48:59.520
great.

48:59.520 --> 49:00.520
Maybe some pixelated boobies.

49:00.520 --> 49:01.520
Who knows?

49:01.520 --> 49:02.520
Anywayó

49:02.520 --> 49:03.520
Perhaps.

49:03.520 --> 49:04.520
What did you call in about tonight, Zaku?

49:04.520 --> 49:11.480
You know, just random stuff, like the fact thatóI forgot what I was going to sayóyeah,

49:11.480 --> 49:19.120
itís likeóI donít know, I was just getting about Tekken 6 and the fact that all the rumors

49:19.120 --> 49:26.240
about it going to the 360, just in general of how the state of affairs is with trying

49:26.240 --> 49:33.080
to make games, that weíre starting to lose exclusives because everythingís going multi-platform.

49:33.080 --> 49:35.520
Let me ask Dark Soccer a little bit about this, because youíre right.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.840
We didnít talk about Tekken 6 tonight at all.

49:37.840 --> 49:41.320
It just kind of missed our show role, but there was a story about Tekken 6 earlier this

49:41.320 --> 49:44.900
week, just some screenshots coming out, and now the rumor is saying that it will be on

49:44.900 --> 49:49.280
PlayStation 3, but coming to the 360 a little bit later, so I know youíre a big Tekken

49:49.280 --> 49:50.280
fan, girl.

49:50.280 --> 49:51.280
What is it, Tek?

49:51.280 --> 49:52.280
Dark Soccer, what do you think?

49:52.280 --> 50:00.320
Iíd still just stick with it on PS3 myself, just because I think itíll look a little

50:00.320 --> 50:04.760
bit better, play a little bit better, and that Namco has just been all about Sony, soó

50:04.760 --> 50:10.080
Yeah, thatís what I was thinking, but then you also have Ace Combat 6, which is 360.

50:10.080 --> 50:16.400
Itís a timed exclusive, which the PS3 version will come afterwards, so itís kind of like

50:16.400 --> 50:17.400
the universe.

50:17.400 --> 50:22.080
It probably also helps that Tekken 6 arcade hardware is built off the PlayStation 3, so

50:22.080 --> 50:25.680
itís probably pretty simple to port it over to the PlayStation 3.

50:25.680 --> 50:30.360
It might take a little longer for Xbox 360, but theyíre not dumb.

50:30.360 --> 50:33.280
Obviously theyíre going to put it over on the 360 at some point.

50:33.280 --> 50:41.240
And if you looked at the recent mini E3 lineup list that they had, apparently, I donít know,

50:41.240 --> 50:47.040
itís just like all I see is very few exclusive PS3 games from other companies.

50:47.040 --> 50:50.600
I mean, obviously Sony is the only one making their own PS3 games.

50:50.600 --> 50:51.600
Well, who knows, though.

50:51.600 --> 50:53.360
Sony may have some surprises in store.

50:53.360 --> 50:58.600
You canít reallyóI mean, usually the announcements about what weíre going to see at E3 is shit

50:58.600 --> 51:03.040
we already know about that was delayed from last year, so a lot of itís going to be surprises,

51:03.040 --> 51:08.080
but Iím assuming if E3 operates any similar way this year than it did last year, which

51:08.080 --> 51:09.080
Iím assuming will be the same thing.

51:09.080 --> 51:11.240
Chances are itís going to be much smaller, much more closed.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.240
Well, besides that, I mean, the wayó

51:12.240 --> 51:13.240
Weíre probably going to get like third-hand information.

51:13.240 --> 51:16.320
But Iím saying the way the news works, you know?

51:16.320 --> 51:17.320
Right.

51:17.320 --> 51:18.320
I think that will still kind of pretty much be the same thing.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.320
The big boys will get in.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.320
Weíll have to feed off of them eventually.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.120
Yeah, well, you know.

51:23.120 --> 51:26.160
At some point, the rest of the internet will get fed up with it, but weíll just wait.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.160
All right.

51:27.160 --> 51:29.680
Well, anyway, Zach, anything else on your mind before we take some other calls?

51:29.680 --> 51:31.560
Thatís about it.

51:31.560 --> 51:34.200
We New Yorkers have 2DX Happy Sky in the arcades.

51:34.200 --> 51:35.200
Oh, where at?

51:35.200 --> 51:40.880
The same place where we find the only pop music machine in the city, Peter Pan Games

51:40.880 --> 51:41.880
in Queens.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.640
I might have to look that place up while Iím out there.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.640
Weíll see.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.640
All right.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
All right.

51:47.640 --> 51:48.640
Later, Zaku.

51:48.640 --> 51:49.640
Bye.

51:49.640 --> 51:50.640
All right.

51:50.640 --> 51:53.160
If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

51:53.160 --> 51:56.320
Letís go to the phones and take another call.

51:56.320 --> 51:57.880
Hello.

51:57.880 --> 51:58.880
You are on OrangeLoungeRadio.

51:58.880 --> 51:59.880
Whoís this?

51:59.880 --> 52:00.880
Hey, hey, hey.

52:00.880 --> 52:01.880
Hi, Emma.

52:01.880 --> 52:02.880
Hey, Rama.

52:02.880 --> 52:03.880
How you doing?

52:03.880 --> 52:04.880
Hi.

52:04.880 --> 52:05.880
How are you doing?

52:05.880 --> 52:06.880
Hi, everyone.

52:06.880 --> 52:07.880
How did you enjoy your trip out to California?

52:07.880 --> 52:08.880
Oh, it was fucking awesome.

52:08.880 --> 52:09.880
I loved it.

52:09.880 --> 52:10.880
Seriously.

52:10.880 --> 52:11.880
Yeah.

52:11.880 --> 52:12.880
Weíre having a hard time hearing you, Rama.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.880
Get a little closer to your microphone.

52:13.880 --> 52:14.880
I said I had fun.

52:14.880 --> 52:15.880
I enjoyed it very much.

52:15.880 --> 52:16.880
Good deal.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.880
I wanted to somehow make my way out there for a weekend just to have fun.

52:19.880 --> 52:20.880
Weíre a fun bunch here.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.880
Well, what did you want to call in and talk about tonight?

52:22.880 --> 52:28.080
Well, one of the things anybodyís been bitching on me about are pictures, so Iím posting a

52:28.080 --> 52:30.800
link in the chat room right now for the pictures.

52:30.800 --> 52:33.400
Oh, do you have pictures of the panel and stuff?

52:33.400 --> 52:35.280
I have a few pictures of the panel.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.280
Nice.

52:36.280 --> 52:37.280
Itís djronemas.mypockybox.com.

52:37.280 --> 52:38.280

Awesome.

52:44.280 --> 52:54.480
Iím looking at some of the pictures right now.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.120
You got tons and tons of cosplayers.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.880
What was some of your favorite cosplay you saw?

52:58.880 --> 53:04.440
I have to be biased, but I was really going for the Ron and the One-Half cosplays because

53:04.440 --> 53:08.560
thereís been a while where not many people are cosplaying that series, but now lately

53:08.560 --> 53:11.200
this is making one hell of a comeback.

53:11.200 --> 53:13.520
The series is kind of old though, right?

53:13.520 --> 53:16.720
Yeah, but great series like that never old.

53:16.720 --> 53:23.520
Now, one of the favorite pieces of cosplay I saw was actually Jonas, whoís been on OLR

53:23.520 --> 53:24.520
before.

53:24.520 --> 53:25.520
Heís been on this program before.

53:25.520 --> 53:27.360
He cosplayed as a Wii remote.

53:27.360 --> 53:28.360
And he was actuallyó

53:28.360 --> 53:29.360
Yeah, that was him.

53:29.360 --> 53:30.360
You believe it?

53:30.360 --> 53:31.360
That was awesome.

53:31.360 --> 53:32.360
Yeah.

53:32.360 --> 53:34.560
He was actually going to come to the show tonight, but I donít think he got the address

53:34.560 --> 53:37.400
in time of where weíre at now because weíve been in like four different studios.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.360
He hasnít been on the show in a long time, but yeah, that was one of my favorite pieces

53:40.360 --> 53:41.360
of cosplay.

53:41.360 --> 53:43.480
Oh my God, thereís the Dolphy pictures.

53:43.480 --> 53:46.040
Iím trying to findóoh, thereís the OLR panel.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.040
Here we are.

53:47.040 --> 53:50.800
Oh, Sky, who are you choking in this picture?

53:50.800 --> 53:51.800
Which one?

53:51.800 --> 53:52.800
Let me look.

53:52.800 --> 53:53.800
Number 124.

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
I just posted it.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.880
Iím going to look.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.120
Who am I choking in this picture?

53:58.120 --> 53:59.120
Thatís Drew Nami.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.680
I thought Drew Nami was on the other side.

54:01.680 --> 54:02.680
No, thatís Drew.

54:02.680 --> 54:03.680
Oh, thatís cool.

54:03.680 --> 54:07.240
You got a bunch of like Orange Lawns radio listeners there.

54:07.240 --> 54:08.240
Thatís cool.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.240
I like that.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.240
Definitely.

54:10.240 --> 54:11.240
Very nice.

54:11.240 --> 54:12.240
One of my friends, Ken, he took the picture for all of us.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.240
Great.

54:13.240 --> 54:15.560
Yeah, I noticed that there was a lot of folks there from chat room, like I recognize some

54:15.560 --> 54:16.560
of the folks.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.560
Awesome.

54:17.560 --> 54:20.080
I didnít know you took a picture of my Dolphys on the table.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.160
Yeah, you asked me to do it.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.520
No, the one in the hotel room.

54:25.520 --> 54:26.520
Oh, yeah.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.320
Oh, I thought you knew about that one.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.320
No, but thatís cool.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.320
Itís a good picture.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
Oh, thatís sweet.

54:31.320 --> 54:32.320
All right.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.840
Anything else you want to share with us, Rama?

54:34.840 --> 54:39.000
The last picture of you and William together in the chat room, the one that everybody loves.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Thank you very much.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Thatís very sweet.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Youíre welcome.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh, God.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
Is that in the gallery?

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Yes.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Are you putting personal pictures?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
All right.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Thatís my trip picture still.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
All right.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.240
I see, because at the very end, oh, yeah, Dark Sakuraís pinball.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.240
All that stuff at her house.

54:51.240 --> 54:52.240
Yes.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.240
All the crazy pinball in her place.

54:53.240 --> 54:54.240
Oh, yeah.

54:54.240 --> 54:55.240
Thereís my friend John.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.240
How funny.

54:56.240 --> 54:59.400
I decided next year, though, that Iím going to do Lolita Mario.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
Oh, yes.

55:00.400 --> 55:03.520
Dude, the gosh-a-mon cosplayers, thatís great.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.520
Of course.

55:04.520 --> 55:05.520
All right.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.480
Well, Rama, thanks so much for coming out.

55:07.480 --> 55:11.160
You are a true fan, pretty hardcore, for coming out all the way to California to see the Orange

55:11.160 --> 55:16.800
Lounge panel and hang with us and go to Fonomay and all that, too, but youíre just awesome.

55:16.800 --> 55:17.800
Thatís all.

55:17.800 --> 55:20.360
Well, plus, it was my birthday the day before.

55:20.360 --> 55:23.120
This was originally like a giant birthday gift to myself.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.120
True that.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.120
Well, happy late birthday a little bit.

55:25.120 --> 55:26.120
Yeah.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.120
Yeah.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.840
Iíll be seeing you this weekend, a couple of coming weekends.

55:28.840 --> 55:29.840
Yeah, definitely.

55:29.840 --> 55:30.840
All right.

55:30.840 --> 55:34.200
I will be posting a forum so we can get things cracking for that.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.200
All right.

55:35.200 --> 55:37.200
Just make sure it happens Sunday afternoon, because thatís the time I got.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.200
Sure.

55:38.200 --> 55:39.200
No problem.

55:39.200 --> 55:40.200
All right.

55:40.200 --> 55:41.200
Sounds good.

55:41.200 --> 55:42.200
All right.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.200
Later.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.200
Later.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.200
All right.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.200
Letís go to some more calls.

55:46.200 --> 55:47.200
Hello.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.200
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

55:48.200 --> 55:49.200
Whoís this?

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
Ravenstaufen.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.200
Hello, Ravenstaufen.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.200
Whatís on your mind?

55:52.200 --> 55:53.200
Match game.

55:53.200 --> 55:54.200
Yeah.

55:54.200 --> 55:55.200
What about match game?

55:55.200 --> 56:01.000
I donít know if you realize, but GSM, when they used to do match game online, and I was

56:01.000 --> 56:05.840
really good at it, and I got on the board on TV that said your name on it, I was heavily

56:05.840 --> 56:08.200
addicted to that for a long, long time.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.240
Donít they still do that?

56:10.240 --> 56:17.800
Yeah, but Comcast being dicks, they took off GSM entirely down here, and Iím pissed.

56:17.800 --> 56:18.880
Oh, that sucks.

56:18.880 --> 56:19.880
So thatís kind of cool.

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
Yeah, thatís right.

56:20.880 --> 56:26.160
You know, we donít talk a whole lot about casual games on the show, certainly, but thatís

56:26.160 --> 56:30.720
pretty cool that they have the, you know, you can play along with the game shows and

56:30.720 --> 56:31.720
stuff.

56:31.720 --> 56:32.720
Iíve actually never done that.

56:32.720 --> 56:33.720
I should sometime.

56:33.720 --> 56:35.600
I love myself some game show network, so there you go.

56:35.600 --> 56:40.640
Yeah, but we cheated sometimes because some people had the, they watch it so many times,

56:40.640 --> 56:45.080
they write down the answers, and they would post it up in the chat room, and we would

56:45.080 --> 56:46.480
get on the leaderboard every time.

56:46.480 --> 56:47.480
It was great.

56:47.480 --> 56:48.480
Awesome.

56:48.480 --> 56:51.480
What else do you want to share with us tonight?

56:51.480 --> 56:53.920
What else do I want to share with you tonight?

56:53.920 --> 56:55.800
Letís see.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.800
Not much.

56:56.800 --> 57:02.080
I just want to just point that out, and thatís about it.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.600
Thereís no one more thing tonight?

57:04.600 --> 57:06.920
Well, I updated my website.

57:06.920 --> 57:08.800
You want to hear about that?

57:08.800 --> 57:09.800
Sure, why not?

57:09.800 --> 57:10.800
Cheap website plug.

57:10.800 --> 57:11.800
Go for it.

57:11.800 --> 57:12.800
Make it quick.

57:12.800 --> 57:13.800
Checkinggame.com.

57:13.800 --> 57:16.040
Oh, I just remembered what I want to talk to you about.

57:16.040 --> 57:17.040
All right, there you go.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.040
What?

57:18.040 --> 57:19.040
Hotel Gus.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.040
Room 215.

57:20.040 --> 57:24.400
I donít know much about, well, I mean, I take that back.

57:24.400 --> 57:25.480
I know about the game.

57:25.480 --> 57:30.240
I havenít played the game because itís just one of those games that is, you know, I canít

57:30.240 --> 57:32.120
play every game that comes out.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.120
What about it though?

57:33.120 --> 57:37.040
Itís not like Phoenix Wright, but I enjoy it.

57:37.040 --> 57:39.540
I thought it was very enjoyable.

57:39.540 --> 57:41.240
What makes it so enjoyable?

57:41.240 --> 57:46.320
Well, you play this guy called Kyle Hyde, and he goes to his place, and the room is

57:46.320 --> 57:47.320
magical.

57:47.320 --> 57:49.800
So this room grants wishes.

57:49.800 --> 57:53.840
So he goes in there, he doesnít know anything, and Iím not going to spoil anything.

57:53.840 --> 57:58.620
So he goes in there, and heís trying to find something out about his friend.

57:58.620 --> 58:02.440
So itís very interesting how all of this comes together.

58:02.440 --> 58:03.440
Interesting.

58:03.440 --> 58:06.600
Well, I mean, I know Mieglatov has the game, so Iíll have to borrow it from him at some

58:06.600 --> 58:09.240
point and give a more fair review on the show later.

58:09.240 --> 58:14.040
Yeah, itís very enjoyable, I thought, but it is a lot of reading.

58:14.040 --> 58:19.500
So for you people that hate Super Paper Mario, youíre probably going to hate this too.

58:19.500 --> 58:22.880
Do you hate Super Paper Mario because thereís too much reading, Loki?

58:22.880 --> 58:24.440
No, thereís not.

58:24.440 --> 58:26.600
Well, there is a lot of reading in the game.

58:26.600 --> 58:29.320
Itís because it gets too repetitive towards the end.

58:29.320 --> 58:32.960
Thereís actual parts in the game where the whole world disappears, and then you have

58:32.960 --> 58:38.680
to run along blankness for about a few minutes, and itís kind of annoying.

58:38.680 --> 58:46.360
Or the Pit of 100 Trials, I know itís a side quest, but itís like 90 minutes of just fighting

58:46.360 --> 58:47.800
enemies over 100 levels.

58:47.800 --> 58:48.800
Itís kind of annoying.

58:48.800 --> 58:49.800
Interesting.

58:49.800 --> 58:50.800
All right.

58:50.800 --> 58:51.800
Well, anything else real quick, Ravenstaufen?

58:51.800 --> 58:52.800
Iím looking at Ramaís pictures in the background.

58:52.800 --> 58:53.800
Anything else, Ravenstaufen?

58:53.800 --> 58:54.800
Oh, sorry.

58:54.800 --> 58:55.800
Sorry.

58:55.800 --> 58:56.800
Thatís all right.

58:56.800 --> 59:03.800
Yeah, I just updated my website, and I just want people to know how it looks, techiegames.com.

59:03.800 --> 59:04.800
All right.

59:04.800 --> 59:05.800
There it is.

59:05.800 --> 59:06.800
All right.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.800
Well, thank you so much for the phone call.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.800
Have a great day.

59:08.800 --> 59:09.800
Bye.

59:09.800 --> 59:10.800
Bye.

59:10.800 --> 59:11.800
All right.

59:11.800 --> 59:12.800
Bye.

59:12.800 --> 59:13.800
All right.

59:13.800 --> 59:14.800
If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge

59:14.800 --> 59:15.800
Radio.

59:15.800 --> 59:16.800
Hi.

59:16.800 --> 59:17.800
Youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

59:17.800 --> 59:18.800
Whoís this?

59:18.800 --> 59:19.800
Hey.

59:19.800 --> 59:20.800
This is BlackDevilRX.

59:20.800 --> 59:21.800
Hello, BlackDevilRX.

59:21.800 --> 59:22.800
Whatís on your mind?

59:22.800 --> 59:23.800
Not much.

59:23.800 --> 59:32.520
Iím trying to get a Wii, but San Francisco seems to be out of Wiis.

59:32.520 --> 59:33.520
You know what?

59:33.520 --> 59:37.280
So does Sacramento and a lot of areas seem to still be out of Wiis after all this time.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.840
Matt, you can give us the distribution angle here, I suppose.

59:39.840 --> 59:41.040
What the hellís going on?

59:41.040 --> 59:42.640
Thereís still some coming in.

59:42.640 --> 59:44.040
Itís just slow.

59:44.040 --> 59:48.160
Itís still everythingís under allocations and everything.

59:48.160 --> 59:52.920
Is there a particular time thatís best to check, like Sunday mornings seem to be pretty

59:52.920 --> 59:53.920
good?

59:53.920 --> 59:54.920
No, not really.

59:54.920 --> 59:57.920
I was called with Virgin, and they were like, ìOh, well, we have 20 on Backorder.î

59:57.920 --> 01:00:03.080
A lot of places are keeping them under wraps until Sundays when they put out their ads.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080
Thatís why.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.920
For a lot of retail chains.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.760
EB Games hasnít seen one for two weeks.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:09.760
Wow.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.760
Have you thought about it?

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:16.000
Can you still do pre-orders with these guys, or do they not do that anymore?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I donít know.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.320
I kind of hesitate to do stuff online because I kind of had a real bad experience with it,

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.440
but I suppose thatís one thing I could do.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.560
James Patrick in chat says, ìMy Toys R Us got 200 of them on Memorial Day.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:31.520
I was there trying to get one.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.440
Sold out in 30 minutes.î

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.220
Thatís crazy.

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.320
My God.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.640
After all this time?

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.640
Seriously?

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640
Wow.

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.080
I guess that just goes to show, Wiiís still a pretty darn successful system.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080
Itís pretty amazing.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080
Itís amazing.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.840
Iím going to get one for myself as a graduation present.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.680
Well, what have you been playing since youíre Wii-less?

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.920
Actually, Iíve been playing a lot of Super Smash Brothers on the GameCube.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.180
There you go.

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:57.440
In anticipation for the new one on the Wii someday?

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440
There you go.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.520
What do you think about all the stuff theyíve announced on the site recently, like the musicians

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.280
and the power-ups and all that, and using the GameCube controller?

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.080
I havenít actually checked out the site lately, but Iíve heard that Snakeís going to be

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.400
in there, which is kind of cool.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400
All right.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.400
Very cool.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.160
I hope they have more of those single-player type modes.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.880
Remember how they had the old-school Mario level that you played Mario?

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:19.880
Oh, yeah.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:20.880
That stuff was so cool.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.520
I hope they have more of that.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520
All right.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.800
Well, BlackDevlerX, thank you so much for the call, and good luck on your hunt for a

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.800
Wii.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800
Try Sunday mornings.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.800
Thatís the best advice we got.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.800
All right.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800
All right.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.800
Later, dude.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.800
All right.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.200
If you would like to give us a call, you can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.320
name is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.760
Weíll take one more call here, and then weíre going to go ahead and call it a night on the

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.560
Skype line and do some last-minute stories, although it does seem to me itís been kind

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:51.320
of a slow news week, huh?

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320
Little bit.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320
Compared to usual.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.320
Maybe itís because of Memorial Day.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.320
It kind of got in the way.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.080
A lot of folks, video game employees, want to go camping too, so there you go.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080
All right.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.080
I saw some other calls coming in.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.080
I saw some others hitting on the line.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.800
God, my pinball room is hot.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800
It really is.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:12.480
And thereís pictures of my garage with my amazing washing machine with my laundry in

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.480
it.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.120
Thereís pictures of my huge ass on there.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.520
God, it looks horrible.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.760
My ass doesnít look so bad in that picture.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.560
You see that Rocky and Bullinkle machine?

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.560
Uh-huh.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560
Thatís mine.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.560
Thatís an awesome machine.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.560
I like that.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.920
The Twilight Zoneís mine too because the play board was made on my birthday.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.320
Now, I wish they would have gotten a shot of the bride and pinball machine because it

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.320
was all in pieces.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.320
Yeah.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.280
It was being shopped out.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.120
I think it has some problem with the brideís face because we had it all pulled out.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.240
Dan or Will could probably tell you better what was going on with it.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.240
Crazy.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.240
All right.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.240
We finally get another call.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.240
Letís take this.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.240
This will be our last call.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.240
Hi.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.240
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.240
Whoís this?

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240
I donít time.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240
I got through.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.240
Gee, whoís Dark Knight?

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.240
Hey, Dark Knight.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.240
Itís just a timing thing.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.560
Itís like a minute and a half and weíre sitting here going, ìDuh, duh, duh, duh,

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.560
duh, duh.î Well, you got through.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.560
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:07.200
I want to talk about something I posted on the website recently about a price cut in

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.520
Lumen Falls next-gen system.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520
Okay.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:18.080
I mean, I would think that I knew it was coming, but this early was kind of a shocker.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:20.080
Being this early was kind of a big shocker to me.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.080
Wait.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.080
Read that by me again because you were breaking up a little.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.080
You say price cuts?

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.080
Yeah.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.120
I said there might be a possible next-gen price cut.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.640
What makes this information more substantial than that?

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.520
To be fair, it seems like every month weíre getting some rumor of an upcoming price cut

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.640
and we have yet to really see a big one.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:43.240
I mean, basically, the latest I got was that they said that Microsoft was going to go first

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.280
at the end of the summer and like a $50 drop.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.840
I would honestly think Microsoftís in a safe place right now until Sony drops it.

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.840
Well, I donít know.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.960
I think Microsoft wants to try and get down there to compete with the Wii a little more

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:00.440
because honestly, if they dropped their core by $50, theyíd be the same price as a Wii,

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.440
right?

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.440
Thatís what they was intending.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.520
They wanted to be at least the same price as a Wii, the core.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:07.840
I donít see why not.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.920
That seems to make a lot of sense.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.920
What do you think, Loki?

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.960
Again, I want your angle on this because youíre kind of on the inside in this.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.680
Well, I donít think that they have any firm plans on dropping any price, but obviously,

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.840
theyíre probably going to be ready to if other companies do it.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.120
Some console makers are probably going to have to drop the price of their system, but

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:27.120
then again, all these analysts just saying, ìOh, thereís a price drop coming.î Yeah,

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.640
thereís a price drop coming eventually.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.520
Theyíre just trying to get out there and say, ìHey, see?

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.520
We called it.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.920
Weíre really good at analyzing stuff.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.160
Look at us.î I would say, because weíre analysts, too,

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.160
of sorts.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.200
I mean, really, what do we do on this show for the past five years, right?

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.140
So I would say if a price cutís coming, itís going to be just before the Christmas rush.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:51.920
So I would say, honestly, price cuts, I think end of summer is a good call, September.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:55.960
I would say youíre going to see some massive price cuts in September, but when I say maybe

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.920
like 50 bucks, 50 bucks on the 360 and the Wii, maybe even, especially if itísÖ

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920
Oh, no.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.040
The source I got at it from, they said Nintendo might not, would probably not think about

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:11.340
it, but maybe like just maybe the 360 and the PS3, possibly.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.040
What if Nintendo announced this?

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.080
Because we still know the Wiis are coming in different colors, right?

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080
Yeah.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.080
Theyíll release the Wiis in different colors with no game included, $199.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.080
There you go.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080
Yeah.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080
That would be good.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080
Yeah?

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.880
I think I could do it right there or put in some other type of pack-in, like, I donít

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:29.880
know, demos or I donít know.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.840
But yeah, just take Wii Sports out of the picture, charge $199 for the colored Wiis.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.840
Yeah.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.840
I could probably see that happening.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.840
There you go.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.800
I mean, it just, I mean, I knew it was coming, but I kind of figured maybe you might see

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:47.320
like maybe another year, at least.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:52.560
Iím telling you, by September, $50 price cuts on Wii and 360, $100 price cut on PS3.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560
Yeah.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.360
If I was a bad man, there it is.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.440
I say a $100 price cut on PS3.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.440
They have to.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.440
They have to.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.440
Yeah, I know.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.840
Then again, they donít have to, actually, because what they could do is just, since

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:10.200
theyíve already dropped their 60 gig or whatever, dropped the 80 gig at the same price as their

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.200
60 and maybe doÖ

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.760
Throw in a game or something to make it.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:17.840
Well, not necessarily throw it in a game, but do the 20 gig price for the 60 gig now.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:22.400
Okay, then if they donít cut it by 100, theyíll put something in there to sweeten the deal.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.400
That would be theÖ

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.400
Right.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.080
Like maybe theyíll drop it by 50, but put $50 worth of extra crap in it, like another

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.080
game.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.840
The hard drive increase, like youíre saying, is something like that.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.840
I could see that.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.760
But Sonyís going to have to do something to sweeten the deal.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Yeah.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.760
I mean, worst case scenario is that if, like I said, PlayStation 3 does make that cut,

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.680
you probably going to see the PS2 hit the $99 mark.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.320
And then N-Gageís, theyíre going to have to give them away for free.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.320
Yeah.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.160
Because thatís the only way Dark Soccer ever touched one was she got it for free.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:55.160
And honestly, they may have to pay me $20 to take an N-Gage.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:00.400
I mean, I saw the thing and I was like, ìI canít believe you told that.î You exactly

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.400
told that.

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400
All right.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.720
Well, thank you so much Dark Knight for your call and weíll see what happens on the price

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720
cut front.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720
All right?

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720
All right.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Thank you.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720
All right.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:10.720
Take care, buddy.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:11.720
Bye.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.720
Bye.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:13.720
Bye.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720
Bye.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.720
Lots and lots of comments from chat here.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.720
Letís see.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.480
Rob D. says, ìI wouldnít be enjoying my 360 half as much if I wasnít a member of

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480
an online community.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.080
The Wii doesnít really have much of anything going for it at the moment beyond the Virtual

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.280
Console.î Interesting.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.200
James Patrick says, ìPlayStation 2 wonít drop to $99 for a while.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:37.360
Sony needs the profit from its current price.î Letís see.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.440
James Patrick says, ìPlayStation 3 sales are in the gutter that needs to increase.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:48.000
Software-wise, I mean, hardware is important too, but software is what counts.î Black

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.960
Boy says, ìThe 360 has been out considerably longer than the Wii, but in terms of sales,

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:59.880
Wii is outselling 360 by crazy amounts.î Very interesting perspectives there in chat.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:05.960
BlackDevil or X says, ìWeíre using the Dreamcast as the minimum bar for sales.î Interesting.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.400
All right.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.960
Of course, if you have more comments, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeontrader.com,

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.820
and weíll read those emails next week on theÖ actually, not next week, but in two

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:19.280
weeks on the program, because a reminder, there will be no show next week.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.400
Letís go around and see if thereís any last-minute stories.

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.240
Actually, I found something interesting.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.240
Yes.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.520
Just some early pictures of the Guitar Hero 3 Les Paul controller.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520
Pretty freaking cool.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.880
Whatís so special about it?

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.520
Well, itís, you know, theyíve done two other Gibson guitars.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:44.760
They did, you know, probably one of, in my opinion, one of their best, but Iíll, actually

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.640
Iím going to link the article in the chatroom so they can see the pictures.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:52.480
It actually looks really sweet, and the buttons on it are black with the colored outlines.

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:59.960
Itís really a lot different than the other controllers have looked, more minimalist.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.080
All right.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.080
Anything else?

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.080
No.

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.080
Loki.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:12.000
Anyway, so, I actually got quite a few things.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.200
First off, some interesting stuff coming out.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.640
Well, first off, thereís supposed to be a rumor that the next issue of EGM is going

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:27.000
to reveal a brand-new Soul Calibur title, not Soul Calibur Legends, Iím guessing, although

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
who knows.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Maybe theyíre doing that again.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.120
We could use the next-gen Soul Calibur game.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.120
That would be pretty awesome.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.560
A new Soul Calibur game possibly being announced, so that would be kind of neat.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.960
Another rumor thatís going on, apparently a website RPG Gamer had an interview with

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:49.760
NS America, and one of the questions was, according to the Q&A, one of the answers to

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:54.240
a question, ìIs Disgaea coming into any other platforms?î They mentioned the DS.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.840
So you might get Disgaea on the DS soon.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.600
Letís see here.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:06.760
So thereís an interesting thing going on.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:12.960
Apparently a certain lawyer type, by the name of Jack, was supposed to beó

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:13.960
Voldemort?

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.960
You mean Lord Voldemort?

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:22.200
Yeah, Voldemort, was apparently going to be debating or participate in a debate during

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.200
PAX this year.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.160
Of course, itís supposed to be kept under wraps, and no word if heís going to back

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.880
out of that one.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:34.360
I had heard he already did, because he put out some retort toóhe thought it was infringing

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:38.680
on his free speech that they werenít going to advertise his appearance, blah, blah, blah.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.880
Who cares what that asshole has to say?

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:49.520
Another interesting thing is console modder Ben Heck is going to be working on a portable

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.880
game system thatís going to be focused around retro games called the Game Port.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:02.560
Itís supposed to be having a five hour battery life, a 480x234 pixel screen, and video out

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.680
for playing on your television, as well as SD card for game storage and etc.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.960
So kind of nifty to see him actually making a console instead of modding them.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.340
Speaking about homebrew stuff, there was a game I talked about on the show a while back

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.840
called No Gravity.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.440
Itís kind of like a Descent Free Space type game.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.800
I think I showed it to you, Rob, one time.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.740
The best fucking homebrew game ever on the PSP, and theyíre actually going to have it

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.160
finished in June.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.720
Full version will be coming out for free!

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:39.640
And itís really sad, because the game can wipe most of those other PSP games out there.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.920
And itís developed independently and for free.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.800
So check out No Gravity later on this month.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.860
And letís see here.

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.920
Another thing thatís kind of interesting, also a trademark, apparently Capcom made a

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.640
trademark for Apollo Justice.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.280
Thereís two rumors regarding this.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.800
Some people think itís going to be a new Rival Schools game, because apparently I guess

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.000
the school is named Apollo or something like that.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.480
No, itís Justice.

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:10.480
Justice.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:19.560
Anyways, the other theory is that itís a subtitle for the next Phoenix Wright game.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.800
Well, it could be either or, huh?

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.800
Yeah, interesting.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.680
I want more Rival Schools, please.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680
Alright.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:31.120
I have a real quick last minute story as well, and Loki, youíll like this one, I think.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.640
1UP recently had an interview with the creator of the Mega Man franchise, and they were asking

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.280
about sequels and bringing Mega Man to the next-gen platforms.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.720
And he basically said, ìWell, donít know if we would be able to recoup the cost of

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.400
making a game on the next-gen platforms.î But they said, ìCome on, just imagine money

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.400
wasnít an issue.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.400
What would you do?î

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:55.640
And he said, ìI think it would probably be Mega Man Legends 3, and thatís not just me.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.680
A lot of the original team members would also love to make a sequel.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:12:59.680
They talk about it.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:00.680
I talk about it sometimes.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.880
I know they love that series, and so do I.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.040
If I were to say right now I have a tiny, tiny, tiny dream that I wish I could realize,

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.920
but I donít know if itís possible, it would be to do a sequel in the Legends series.î

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.280
Hell yeah, thatís a series that they need to take even further, because these other

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.280
series kind of suck.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.360
No, thatís a series they need to shoot in the head, put it down like an old horse.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360
Put it down.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.760
Give me more Mega Man X, please.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.760
I love the Legends series.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.840
Sorry, Iím a 2D gamer.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.720
I would like to see some type of next-gen Mega Man.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.440
I think itís okay to do a 2D Mega Man.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.480
Continue Legends series on the Wii.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.480
Itís perfect.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:38.280
I mean, it was an original PlayStation game.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.680
You can definitely push those kind of graphics on that system.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.560
Itís not Mega Man.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.560
Who cares?

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560
I do.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560
I love Mega Man.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:50.960
For me, just to have it go 3D in the first place was like ripping out my heart and dancing

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.280
the lombata on it.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.280
No, you like the Mega Man X series and the original Mega Man series.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.640
This is a different series.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:01.440
Just like the Marvel series, how they have like the Marvel 2017 series and the Marvel

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.040
Universe series and all this other stuff, well, it doesnít matter.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.320
Just donít have to like this series.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.600
I like this series, so they should make another one.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:15.040
All I could say is please anything but those tactical games on the DS.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.040
Oh, man.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.040
Oh, my God.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.040
I think we can all agree on that.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.040
That series put it to bed.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.240
Well, going on the same thing, though, that Loki is saying, thatís actually based off

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.280
of a completely different series, the Mega Man EXE is what those were.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.200
Yeah, or the Battle Network, thatís what it was called.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.560
Well, it was Rockman EXE.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
Put it to bed.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.680
It was actually based off of an anime.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.680
Put a bullet in its head and be done.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.200
Itís not the same type of thing.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.240
This is supposed to be Mega Man.

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.960
This is actually something 100% completely different, just borrowing the name.

01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.120
It makes sense why itís a different type of game.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.240
And James Patrick says in chat, Mega Man, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero,

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.240
Mega Man Battle Network.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.240
Mega Man, stop this.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.240
Stop it.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:01.720
As long as they donít do a next-gen series that looks like the cover of Mega Man 2 or

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720
something like that.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720
Okay.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:10.280
The US Capcom art in those days, I mean, did you see the cover for Bionic Commando?

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.280
They were pretty awful.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.280
The only cool game that had any, you know, American redone art that was any good was

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.480
like Metal Gear, because the dude looked like, you know, hardcore awesome.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.880
Oh no, the truck half started to move.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:29.000
The least in Bionic Commando, you can kill Hitler.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.440
Yeah, and you know what, some of the, I always think of the box art even back from the Atari

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.960
2600 days, where they had these elaborate artwork on the box, which of course the game

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.000
looked nothing like, because it was just a bunch of blocks on the screen.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.120
It was just, I donít know.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.120
Box artís funny.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.760
Anyhow, thatís going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.760
or not.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.240
Letís go around and get everybodyís final thought.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.800
Dark Soccer, why donít you start us off tonight.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800
Your final thought.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:59.200
Um, okay, I thought it.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.400
My final thought is ice cream.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.360
Loki, your final thought.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.120
My final thought is this screen for the Wii thing.

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.120
It looks kind of neat.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.120
Itís like a portable screen.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.120
I donít know though, I still wouldnít buy it.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.160
Alright, until next time, thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent

Thank you guys so much.

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:33.440

Remember that from Total Recall?

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440
No.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440
I donít remember that.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440
Bye!
