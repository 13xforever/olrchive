00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:26,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this, our episode number 234 for June the 3rd of 2007.

3
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,908
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be celebrating our 5th anniversary on June 24th of this year, if you can believe it.

4
00:00:33,249 --> 00:00:36,210
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we've hit so many episodes, if you wonder why 234 is a lot.

5
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news.

6
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget Orange Lounge Radio is in two parts every week.

7
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,712
[SPEAKER_04]: If you missed some, be sure to go back wherever you got this episode.

8
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably has part A linked as well.

9
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:47,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Be sure to grab that.

10
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:49,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Toshiba DVD Drives TSH-943

12
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:30,054
[SPEAKER_02]: That will allow you to play backup copies and legally purchased Xbox 360 titles, as well as it defeats all current and some future Xbox Live detection attempts.

13
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:39,562
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because of that, it's actually allowing people to be able to use Xbox Live without them knowing that you have a modded console.

14
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:43,585
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, fight the fight, I guess.

15
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:44,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

16
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:52,384
[SPEAKER_04]: But Microsoft has always been, like, really good about fixing this kind of crap the second it comes out.

17
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:54,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I shouldn't say crap.

18
00:01:54,105 --> 00:01:55,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it actually is pretty smart.

19
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:55,925
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what I mean.

20
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, they put the banhammer on this stuff ASAP.

21
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, how long is this going to last?

22
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends.

23
00:02:03,388 --> 00:02:08,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we'll see how effective this stuff is, but that's big business for them.

24
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:14,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you look at Sony, they've tried and tried with the PSP, but there's no luck there.

25
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:21,750
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know how much of DVD firmware they can really detect.

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,111
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not really a lot that they can do, I think.

27
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:32,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they circumvent the few methods that they have of checking, they might be screwed.

28
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:37,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they just do a whole hardware revision or something.

29
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:38,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll see.

30
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:39,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

31
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:40,877
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

32
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:41,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think the

33
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:48,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Hackers and Crackers will win in this war, or do you think Microsoft will be able to stay on top of them?

34
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:58,618
[SPEAKER_13]: There's one thing that always works in favor of anyone who decides to system hack, and that's called system becoming obsolete.

35
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:02,021
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to care if the next one's going to come out.

36
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:03,462
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll say, well, screw the old one.

37
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone's like, yay, we win, because we held out.

38
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:09,633
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like a, it's a waiting war, essentially.

39
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:10,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

40
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:10,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

41
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:11,274
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

42
00:03:11,494 --> 00:03:30,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 2, you know, they had, granted, you know, the methods of, you know, doing swap discs and stuff like that, and the DVD loader and stuff, and now, you know, you have the whole running off of hard drives and stuff, and it's just like, shit, I mean, you don't have to buy anything for the PlayStation 2 anymore, you can download everything.

43
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,125
[SPEAKER_13]: If people want it bad enough, they'll find a way.

44
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,927
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember the days of the seven swap tricks.

45
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,640
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

46
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:00,128
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's fucked up to cheat in online games.

47
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:01,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those types of people deserve to get banned.

48
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's doing it for cheating in online games.

49
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just not having to buy those $60 games is what they're doing.

50
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:09,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe imports.

51
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:10,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Imports might be nice.

52
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:12,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

53
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't agree with region control.

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why they do it.

55
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:24,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to say it makes no sense because of licensing and all those other things for the music and what have you that they get in the games.

56
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,689
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day...

57
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks for the consumer.

58
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,520
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

59
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:48,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, something else that is confusing, nevertheless, for the consumers is that Destructoid ran this article earlier this week about the Xbox 360 and the fact that Metal Gear Solid 4 is confirmed for the Xbox 360.

60
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the article was kind of weird.

61
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:52,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's funny.

62
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,971
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who wrote it, Ron Workman, was actually on our year-end special

63
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of wondering if we should call them up and try to figure out what's going on.

64
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:02,652
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know if they'll talk because supposedly Konami sent out a cease and desist.

65
00:05:03,392 --> 00:05:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Destructo has always been a pretty respectable site in my mind, so I don't think they'd pull these stories out of their butt.

66
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:19,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just kind of wondering, like it was very interesting to kind of watch that happen where they had to be very vague about it and then they have this cease and desist coming from Konami which seems to cement it if that is legit.

67
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know, could the whole thing be an elaborate prank?

68
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:23,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

69
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:29,091
[SPEAKER_04]: But Computer Game World seems to think so because they ran a counter story a little later on.

70
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, that's Computer and Video Games.

71
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:32,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, carried it to the wrong site.

72
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:39,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Computerandvideogames.com ran a counter point a little later on in the week saying Konami's confirmed nothing is essentially what it's saying.

73
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So saying that no, Metal Gear Solid 4 has not been confirmed for 360.

74
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:43,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami's confirmed nothing.

75
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:50,128
[SPEAKER_04]: But the weird thing about this report is that they're basing it on the fact that they've talked to Konami about

76
00:05:50,376 --> 00:06:18,697
[SPEAKER_04]: and Konami refuses to comment on the rumors and that they've made no statement regarding the 360 version and in my mind I kind of go well that's what we all I mean of course Konami's not going to say anything about it if they send a cease and desist to one site it's because they're not ready to comment on this trust us we know this very well okay that so it kind of doesn't mean anything to me that doesn't discount the story at all so I don't know well speaking of the rumor mill

77
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:20,890
[SPEAKER_13]: and Konami, wow.

78
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:33,035
[SPEAKER_13]: There actually were rumors that popped up in this month's issue of EGM stating that Silent Hill 5 was going to be a release this year and handled by Konami USA instead of in Japan.

79
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:44,240
[SPEAKER_13]: But there was also an interview with the director, Tsubuyama Masashi, who, like I said, was the chief director on the project.

80
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,561
[SPEAKER_13]: and he stated that they don't have anything official.

81
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:54,183
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually were looking more next-gen console, multi-platform.

82
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,305
[SPEAKER_13]: He did say to keep our eyes on the upcoming press conference on July 11th.

83
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's during E3, isn't it?

84
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:02,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

85
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:03,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo!

86
00:07:03,566 --> 00:07:05,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll probably be revealing Silent Hill 5 at that time.

87
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:07,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

88
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:08,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

89
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Try to find my invite.

90
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:12,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

91
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:14,504
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as the series doesn't jump the shark, I'll be okay.

92
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:17,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I think multi-platform is the way to go, though, honestly.

93
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:21,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, Xbox 360 still hasn't really cracked the marketplace in Japan.

94
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:27,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, I think most of us here would like to see it show up on 360, but over in Japan, you kind of have to put it on PlayStation 3.

95
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:31,809
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii is just probably not going to be able to handle what they're going to want to do graphically with the game.

96
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:35,070
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have Silent Hill where you play as, you know...

97
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,821
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

98
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:06,038
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool, though.

99
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:10,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill Babies coming to ABC Family Saturday mornings.

100
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:16,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder Dog Harold says Pyramid Head Mysterious Dungeon would be a fun day.

101
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:17,447
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be great.

102
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,009
[SPEAKER_04]: With cutesy little music and everything.

103
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:24,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Super chibi Pyramid Head, you know.

104
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:27,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, he just beheaded the cat.

105
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:31,078
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be fantastic.

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, um,

107
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:37,853
[SPEAKER_02]: and other interesting stuff.

108
00:08:37,953 --> 00:09:06,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out of the Halo 3 beta, there's been people actually hacking the beta to reveal all sorts of fun stuff, including they have a brand new chopper that you can ride in the game, the sword, as well as radar jamming items, player-operated turrets added to the wraiths, actually playing with the wraith

109
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:13,549
[SPEAKER_02]: and different modifications including, you know, ground speed and gravity and all that sorts of stuff.

110
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:17,770
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty cool, I guess, that you can modify the beta to do that.

111
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe people have already cracked the game and it's already in beta.

112
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:23,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just imagine when the game actually comes out.

113
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:28,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised they did this because people love their Halo almost a little too much, you know what I mean?

114
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:29,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

115
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:31,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

116
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:43,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Also something to mention about Halo 3 is that GamePro is going to be running an article talking about that there are, you know, well actually I should say the article is going to be showing new vehicles, new maps, new weapons, and armor.

117
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:47,303
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, because Halo 3 is going to have armor in it, new armor.

118
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:54,688
[SPEAKER_04]: You can create, or I shouldn't say create, but you can get armor for your characters, like new shoulder pads, new helmets, so that's kind of cool.

119
00:09:54,748 --> 00:10:01,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I look at this one helmet on the particular scans from the site, it looks like an alien head or something on the helmet, so kind of neat.

120
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising Dead Rising, huh?

121
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:38,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Dead Rising has some new costumes and themes for Xbox Live.

122
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,833
[SPEAKER_13]: But the costumes are a white suit, a striped outfit, and an accountant outfit.

123
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:47,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because I really like to look like an accountant when I'm beating up the undead.

124
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:50,696
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I put on my suit.

125
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:53,237
[SPEAKER_13]: You could.

126
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:54,758
[SPEAKER_13]: One beheading.

127
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:55,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Two beheadings.

128
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:59,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't that game keep a body cage anyway?

129
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.

130
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:00,081
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

131
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:04,556
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess you can look the part when you're adding up the corpses.

132
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:07,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

133
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:10,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also dress up like an accountant and slam a cash register into them.

134
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:12,797
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, keep the change!

135
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:14,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Office space the game.

136
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:16,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have a Naked Time costume in that game?

137
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:18,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, underoos or something?

138
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,699
[SPEAKER_02]: They have really tight shorts that you can wear, little kid shorts.

139
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:23,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.

140
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:24,659
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little scary.

141
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You can run around as hard gay.

142
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Beating up the zombies.

143
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:30,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Hapitai

144
00:11:53,212 --> 00:12:01,456
[SPEAKER_02]: including some bills being passed regarding the ESRB ratings and selling minors M-rated games.

145
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:15,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, the law has passed and it's going to make a felony, a Class E felony at least, the least severe felony in the state, if you sell a M-rated game to a minor.

146
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:20,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So, better be careful before you sell those minors.

147
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:22,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Mortal Kombat, Grand Theft Auto

148
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:51,298
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

149
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:53,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bullshit!

150
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, DarkSakura?

151
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Grandstanding is what it is.

152
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,039
[SPEAKER_12]: It's stupid.

153
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:57,620
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

154
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

155
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,600
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

156
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,721
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into, and actually I'm looking at some comments in the chat room here.

157
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:06,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, Law sucks in general.

158
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:08,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sometimes.

159
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:17,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, Unless New York State does a lot of secret shopping and or undercover sting operations, which they won't, this law will not fucking stick at all.

160
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gerardimo says, Oh, I'm a New York minor.

161
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:23,630
[SPEAKER_04]: But I only have a Wii, so I'm going to have a hard time finding an M game.

162
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Scarface, Manhunt, Driver.

163
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but don't buy Driver.

164
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:30,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

165
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:32,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you want to laugh.

166
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:33,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

167
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,453
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bad AI.

168
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:42,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, folks, it's about time that we play a little bit of our favorite game to play here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

169
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It's... The Match Game.

170
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:46,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen...

171
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:51,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to open up the phone lines right now to get a contestant.

172
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:55,633
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one contestant from the chat room, and we just need to get an opponent.

173
00:13:55,693 --> 00:14:00,275
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you'd like to give us a call, we'll take the first call on our Skype line.

174
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:04,096
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

175
00:14:04,116 --> 00:14:05,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call us either way.

176
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:10,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And first off, we'll go around and introduce the special guest that will be playing tonight.

177
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, please help us introduce the guest tonight.

178
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and guest number one, your name.

179
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:21,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And where have you come from?

180
00:14:25,526 --> 00:14:26,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

181
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,086
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very cool.

182
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:30,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And guest number two, your name?

183
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:32,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov.

184
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I don't care where you came from.

185
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where did you come from, Miklatov?

186
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:40,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Galactica.

187
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, we got a contestant call here, hold on.

188
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

189
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:48,702
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Wonder Dog Harold.

190
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:50,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Wonder Dog Harold.

191
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:50,984
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

192
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine.

193
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:53,645
[SPEAKER_04]: You win.

194
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,165
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to play match game tonight, okay?

195
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Huzzah.

196
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:57,526
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right.

197
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So hold on the line while we introduce the rest of the panelists tonight, okay?

198
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:14,314
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, tonight, speaking of panelists, tonight's edition of the match game here on Orange Launch Radio, we had to do it tonight, dedicated to Mr. Charles Nelson Riley, who was from the 70s edition of the match game, which, you know, obviously we are,

199
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,936
[SPEAKER_04]: We are blatantly ripping off the match game from the 70s.

200
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:19,377
[SPEAKER_04]: You see the reruns on Game Show Networks.

201
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: He passed away this week and was one of the main reasons to watch that show.

202
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:25,599
[SPEAKER_04]: He was awesome, so we're dedicating this edition to him.

203
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, so yes, Rice, Princess, and Megalotop are here.

204
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,442
[SPEAKER_04]: They are sacrificing some of their precious time away from watching Battlestar Galactica episodes back to back to back to be here.

205
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you guys have watched, like, what, like seven episodes so far this weekend?

206
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:39,484
[SPEAKER_04]: How many?

207
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:39,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

208
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,114
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot.

209
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:43,915
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to take up too much of your precious time.

210
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:46,477
[SPEAKER_04]: So also joining us is Loki.

211
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm here.

212
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:49,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, of course.

213
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:50,979
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura.

214
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Rawr.

215
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And me, because I'm awesome.

216
00:15:54,982 --> 00:15:56,683
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so you have five folks tonight.

217
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:58,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And WonderDogHerald's on the phone.

218
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:58,704
[SPEAKER_04]: You still there?

219
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:00,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

220
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:00,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

221
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:03,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's going to be playing against HitStun from the chatroom.

222
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,308
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun from the chatroom won our drawing during the break.

223
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now, WonderDogHerald, do you know how the game works?

224
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:09,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

225
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:12,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to, for those that don't, I'll just explain it again.

226
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:17,397
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be asking some questions, and we're going to put in the blanks.

227
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:22,860
[SPEAKER_04]: There's blanks at the end of them, and you are supposed to come up with what you believe belongs in the blank.

228
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you match with anybody in the studio, then you get a point.

229
00:16:27,223 --> 00:16:27,503
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?

230
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we only have three questions tonight, though.

231
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:32,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a short game tonight.

232
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready to play?

233
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:35,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

234
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,168
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

235
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:37,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready to play, Wonder Dog Harold?

236
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

237
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:42,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Question 1.

238
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob just landed himself in big trouble.

239
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:54,665
[SPEAKER_04]: When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card was declined.

240
00:16:55,445 --> 00:17:03,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, Rob, we turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much blank.

241
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:18,239
[SPEAKER_04]: All our guests are thinking about their answers and writing them down.

242
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, we've turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much blank.

243
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:24,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

244
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:26,483
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

245
00:17:27,503 --> 00:17:27,963
Ding.

246
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:28,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

247
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:29,224
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some dings.

248
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:29,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Dingy.

249
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:31,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're done.

250
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:33,386
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

251
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,267
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

252
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for the... Okay, there we go.

253
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:39,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And all right.

254
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you got an answer, Wonder Dog Herald?

255
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:42,931
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready?

256
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:43,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?

257
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:46,697
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still thinking.

258
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:49,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, while you're thinking... Alright, here we go.

259
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:51,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll read the question one more time, then we're going to go to you for an answer.

260
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:51,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

261
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob just landed himself in big trouble.

262
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,101
[SPEAKER_04]: When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card was declined.

263
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:06,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, Rob, we turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much... What do you think, WonderDog?

264
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:06,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn.

265
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn, says WonderDog Harold.

266
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:09,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much porn.

267
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:11,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit stun...

268
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: also said porn, so this isn't going to be a very exciting round because if anybody gets porn, they both get a point.

269
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:18,611
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

270
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:20,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what our celebrity panel came up with.

271
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with Rice Princess.

272
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:24,555
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been buying too much?

273
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:27,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Silent Occupied Caprica.

274
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:30,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much Silent Occupied Caprica.

275
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a match?

276
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,702
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that would not be a match.

277
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:38,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something from Battlestar Galactica, actually, and we are playing video game match game now.

278
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:39,146
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

279
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:46,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov, he's been buying too much... Because porn is such a totally video game related thing.

280
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:51,951
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been buying too much Helo, which is like Halo, but Helo.

281
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,252
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be porn for me.

282
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:56,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Battlestar Galactica reference.

283
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for that.

284
00:18:57,254 --> 00:18:58,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much Helo.

285
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:04,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match, though, even if that is the object of Shane's fantasies we don't need to hear about on the show.

286
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:07,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, he's been buying too much... Actraiser.

287
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Actraiser.

288
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:10,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Good guess.

289
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Loved it so much he had to buy it five times over.

290
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, to put it in the top five.

291
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:16,178
[SPEAKER_04]: He bought it for all of his friends.

292
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:16,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, there you go.

293
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Filled up one whole page of Actraiser.

294
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:19,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I should do that.

295
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,564
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, he's been buying too much.

296
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:23,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Propel.

297
00:19:23,585 --> 00:19:24,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Propel.

298
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:25,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't used it in ages.

299
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:26,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, Propel.

300
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:27,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually drank some Propel today.

301
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it good?

302
00:19:29,091 --> 00:19:29,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

303
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:30,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, Rob.

304
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:31,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like fitness water.

305
00:19:31,173 --> 00:19:31,413
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good.

306
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:37,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, we turned off your credit card because you've been buying too much candy.

307
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:38,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm fat.

308
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Candy.

309
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:40,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

310
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:41,415
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

311
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:43,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

312
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,858
[SPEAKER_04]: No matches for either contestant that round.

313
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:46,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to say.

314
00:19:46,698 --> 00:19:47,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, WonderDogHerald.

315
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:50,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

316
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:53,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very emotive.

317
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

318
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,585
[SPEAKER_04]: You ready to get some points on the second question?

319
00:19:58,987 --> 00:19:59,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

320
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:00,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

321
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:04,658
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I like, some excited contestants.

322
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:05,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

323
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:07,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Question number two.

324
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort.

325
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:12,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Liar.

326
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's been very... It's a game, Jamie.

327
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:16,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Play along.

328
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:26,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but she's been very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts she's seen on game blogs lately.

329
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, they have the little coasters that have Zelda pictures and stuff.

330
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to Kotaku or something, you'll see it.

331
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:34,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts she's seen on game blogs lately.

332
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:43,195
[SPEAKER_04]: She joined a community college class on knitting, but got kicked out of the class when her first project she brought in was blank.

333
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:55,758
[SPEAKER_04]: She joined a community college class on knitting, but got kicked out of the class when for her first project she brought in blank.

334
00:20:55,778 --> 00:20:59,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh, Ding.

335
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:00,800
Ding.

336
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding.

337
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:02,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang.

338
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:04,513
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

339
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:05,793
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

340
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:11,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just waiting for our chat room player.

341
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:15,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully our phone player has thought of an answer, too.

342
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,216
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room is helping out.

343
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:20,837
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

344
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:27,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, one of these answers is an incredibly poor taste.

345
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:28,699
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

346
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:31,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually are nobody.

347
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:33,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

348
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:34,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

349
00:21:34,402 --> 00:21:35,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Is everybody dinged?

350
00:21:36,283 --> 00:21:36,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

351
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:38,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

352
00:21:38,404 --> 00:21:38,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

353
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but she's been very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts she's seen on game blogs lately.

354
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:53,433
[SPEAKER_04]: She joined a community college class on knitting, but got kicked out of the class for when her first project she brought in... Wonder Dog Harold?

355
00:21:54,974 --> 00:21:56,655
[SPEAKER_10]: A sweater with Clark Gay on it.

356
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,764
[SPEAKER_04]: A sweater with Hard Gay on it.

357
00:21:58,864 --> 00:21:59,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

358
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,487
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been paying attention to the show because Jamie's been watching Hard Gay.

359
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:03,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

360
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:03,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

361
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:04,908
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see if it matches.

362
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:07,430
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun said a shotgun.

363
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,971
[SPEAKER_04]: She brought in a shotgun.

364
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:11,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Which might be... Too soon.

365
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:12,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Too soon.

366
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:12,733
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

367
00:22:12,753 --> 00:22:13,253
[SPEAKER_04]: But all right.

368
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:14,054
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the answer.

369
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:15,455
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

370
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:16,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess.

371
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:21,398
[SPEAKER_12]: She brought in... She brought in a Cylon Occupy Caprica.

372
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately...

373
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:44,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Cylon Occupied Caprica is not a match and is still a Battlestar Galactica reference Rice Princess, we are playing video game Candy is not video games either, so shut up Nintendo Cereal was candy There's a Battlestar game coming out, so take that Will it have Cylon Occupied Caprica in it?

374
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:54,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably Alright, here it is For her first project, she brought in Hilo Guys, you know what your next answers have to be, right?

375
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:57,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly.

376
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:04,030
[SPEAKER_04]: This, by the way, will be the last appearance of Rice Princess Miklatov on our show.

377
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Say goodbye, folks.

378
00:23:05,172 --> 00:23:05,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been fun.

379
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:07,254
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a fun five years.

380
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,858
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been swell, but the swelling's gone down.

381
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:11,619
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

382
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:18,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, she brought in... The corpse of Charles Nelson Reilly.

383
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:22,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Too soon!

384
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:23,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Too soon!

385
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:24,803
[SPEAKER_04]: In my refrigerator, hi!

386
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:29,065
[SPEAKER_02]: She brought in the corpse of Charles Nelson Reilly to her knitting class?

387
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:30,165
[SPEAKER_02]: That's horrible!

388
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:35,747
[SPEAKER_02]: She needed a reference, you know, a lifelike reference of knitting his corpse.

389
00:23:36,107 --> 00:23:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, she brought in... A Glock 37?

390
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:40,168
[SPEAKER_04]: A Glock 37?

391
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:42,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Too soon!

392
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:42,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a gun!

393
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:44,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you watch the news?

394
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,970
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

395
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You are not supposed to make guns at college jokes, that's not cool.

396
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:51,678
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't make fun of it, how will you ever recover?

397
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:52,358
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, true.

398
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:53,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it's a half of a match, though.

399
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:55,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Is a Glock 37 a shotgun?

400
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:56,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

401
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,759
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but it's a firearm, so it gets to have a blink.

402
00:23:58,899 --> 00:23:59,860
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

403
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,460
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

404
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,621
[SPEAKER_04]: No, porn and Hilo are not a match.

405
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:05,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither is shotgun and whatever Jamie said.

406
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:06,861
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

407
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:08,902
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a powerful gun.

408
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:13,263
[SPEAKER_04]: GS191 says, does this mean I can call Loki a nappy-headed hoe, then?

409
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:14,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

410
00:24:14,363 --> 00:24:14,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

411
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:15,583
[SPEAKER_04]: He kind of is.

412
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,704
[SPEAKER_04]: My hair is not nappy.

413
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:19,914
[SPEAKER_13]: The chatroom calls for half a point.

414
00:24:20,214 --> 00:24:20,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

415
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:23,877
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's nice for the chatroom.

416
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:24,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad it's not their game.

417
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:25,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

418
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:34,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that she brought in, because it was a knitting class, she brought in a quilt with Pyramid Head raping a corpse.

419
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:37,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

420
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,133
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you don't make quilts in knitting class.

421
00:24:41,294 --> 00:24:43,095
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why they kicked her out, stupid!

422
00:24:44,346 --> 00:24:46,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, my other answer was going to be Bloody Steel Needles.

423
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:50,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Pyramid Head was raping Charles Nelson Reilly's corpse, so go figure.

424
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,430
[SPEAKER_12]: With a shotgun.

425
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,311
[SPEAKER_12]: That would not be attractive.

426
00:24:56,052 --> 00:24:56,372
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

427
00:24:56,392 --> 00:24:57,632
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be attractive, Rob.

428
00:24:58,033 --> 00:24:59,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Wonder Dog Harold, I'm very sorry.

429
00:24:59,653 --> 00:25:00,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have a zero.

430
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:02,355
Ow!

431
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:03,195
Shit!

432
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:04,036
That hurt.

433
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:07,337
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dark Sakura just injured herself, so at least you get that.

434
00:25:07,357 --> 00:25:09,438
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I injured my laptop and indirectly injured myself.

435
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:09,978
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

436
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder Dog Harold, are you going to get a point on this last one?

437
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:26,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fanime.

438
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,768
[SPEAKER_04]: He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

439
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:32,608
[SPEAKER_04]: He said to himself, that's it.

440
00:25:33,268 --> 00:25:35,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year I'm coming dressed as blank.

441
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:46,447
[SPEAKER_04]: He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

442
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:50,289
[SPEAKER_04]: He said to himself, that's it, next year I'm coming dressed as blank.

443
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:58,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, ding!

444
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, ding?

445
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:01,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Dingy.

446
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:02,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm waiting on the chatroom.

447
00:26:03,336 --> 00:26:04,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Sir Dingly Dang.

448
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:06,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

449
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,140
[SPEAKER_04]: No extrovert, you're too late, you can't play now.

450
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:10,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

451
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:11,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a ding.

452
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do a bonus point.

453
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,430
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do a bonus point.

454
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

455
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:19,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Extrovert wants to be a bonus point.

456
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:20,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

457
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:21,513
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

458
00:26:21,533 --> 00:26:22,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think we got an answer.

459
00:26:24,454 --> 00:26:24,654
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

460
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:25,034
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

461
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:26,955
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

462
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:27,716
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the end of the music.

463
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:28,576
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

464
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:28,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

465
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:33,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Faname.

466
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:36,100
[SPEAKER_04]: He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

467
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,421
[SPEAKER_04]: He said to himself, that's it.

468
00:26:37,501 --> 00:26:40,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year I'm coming dressed as Wonder Dog Harold.

469
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:41,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilo?

470
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:42,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilo!

471
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:44,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Says... Okay.

472
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,430
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so I see the tactic you're taking here.

473
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,431
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, let's see if it's a match.

474
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:50,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess.

475
00:26:50,572 --> 00:26:51,212
Wait, I have the microphone.

476
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:52,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the other guy?

477
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:53,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

478
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:53,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

479
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:54,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitsun, sorry.

480
00:26:55,134 --> 00:27:00,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitsun said, I'm coming dressed as Miss World 96 Nude.

481
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:01,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

482
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:02,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

483
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:02,819
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

484
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:03,279

[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, Miglatov, what was your answer?

[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so there it is.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

523
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,385
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun got zero.

524
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:54,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That means we win.

525
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And WonderDogHerald, I'm sorry to say, you got zero as well.

[SPEAKER_13]: So you have to give us money.

527
00:28:58,769 --> 00:28:59,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I say something?

528
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

529
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:03,320
[SPEAKER_08]: My dog's been lost for two days and they found her.

530
00:29:04,341 --> 00:29:04,861
[SPEAKER_03]: In one piece?

531
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:05,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:05,922

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad the bitch is okay.

00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really depressed for two days.

538
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:13,205
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

539
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:21,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder Dog Harold, as a consolation prize, I'll let you plug any website or something you want to give a plug to here on air.

540
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:23,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

541
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:28,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a man of many words, Wonderdog Harold.

542
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:29,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

543
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for calling in and being a contestant tonight.

544
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:33,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

545
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:34,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care.

546
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:36,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

547
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:37,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

548
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:39,996
[SPEAKER_13]: That was great.

549
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:41,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have you on the show more often.

550
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:42,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderdog Harold said like ten words.

551
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:44,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when Miklatov guests on the show.

552
00:29:44,578 --> 00:29:45,839
[SPEAKER_04]: He says ten words the entire show.

553
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,300
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to be in studio.

554
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:49,421
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll see if you speak more.

555
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

556
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we had 0-0.

557
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody is a loser.

558
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,040
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun says, the chat failed me.

559
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,620
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fired.

560
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,761
[SPEAKER_04]: HitStun says, you know, I can challenge WonderDogHerald at Tetris DS or Mario Kart or something.

561
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:06,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the chat room was screaming tingle.

562
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:07,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been a point.

563
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:09,943
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's it for Match Game.

564
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:14,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And at this point, I will now kick out all of the guests because... It's hot in here.

565
00:30:14,924 --> 00:30:16,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously need to go watch Battlestar Galactica some more.

566
00:30:16,724 --> 00:30:17,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Give us some ice cream, though.

567
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:19,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I want ice cream.

568
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:20,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys going to get ice cream?

569
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:20,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Get milkshakes.

570
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:21,165
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

571
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:22,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get ice cream.

572
00:30:22,893 --> 00:30:23,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys get ice cream.

573
00:30:23,534 --> 00:30:24,534
[SPEAKER_13]: You can give me a milkshake.

574
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Or we can go get ice cream and not bring any back.

575
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:29,257
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

576
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:32,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we'll let you guys take over the afterbirth while we go get ice cream.

577
00:30:32,438 --> 00:30:32,878
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do that?

578
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:38,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we make our own cage match?

579
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:39,242
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think so.

580
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:39,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it.

581
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:40,903
[SPEAKER_13]: I put in an awesome song.

582
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:41,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, think about it.

583
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, think about it and give it back to me.

584
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:46,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I know.

585
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:48,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll just be a theme from Battlestar Galactica.

586
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

587
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:52,134
[SPEAKER_13]: You can let me do it and it'll all be Doctor Who.

588
00:30:52,495 --> 00:30:55,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, tonight's match game was a colossal failure.

589
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:58,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Doctor Who is cooler than Battlestar Galactica!

590
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about that.

591
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:02,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a pretty good show.

592
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't egg them on.

593
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:04,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, seriously, don't encourage them.

594
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:07,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk about porn.

595
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:08,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

596
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I get a yay for porn?

597
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:11,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

598
00:31:11,228 --> 00:31:14,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, this isn't real porn, but it's Leisure Suit Larry, which is kind of like, you know,

599
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:16,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Leisure Suit Larry is coming to mobile platforms

600
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:51,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Larry fans worldwide have a strong allegiance to the classic Leisure Suit Larry adventure game format.

601
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:53,987
[SPEAKER_04]: We are delighted to be doing just that with the mobile version.

602
00:31:54,347 --> 00:32:01,432
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kept the iconic Larry humor and attitude intact while adapting the graphics, language, and controls for a mass market global audience.

603
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:05,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go, some pixelated JavaScript titty coming to a cell phone near you.

604
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:34,934
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you want your titties to be more realistic then Dead or Alive the movie is coming out June 15th and well it's going to be about as deep as Mortal Kombat the movie probably less deep but it will be coming out to theaters and there will be lots of chicks fighting and I know there's one scene with a chick fighting

605
00:32:35,612 --> 00:32:42,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Topless, but of course, you know, this is... Is this because you've already watched the whole movie on Google Video when it was out a while ago?

606
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:46,400
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I downloaded the PSP version of it off of Google Video.

607
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,921
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

608
00:32:48,501 --> 00:33:03,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, speaking of things that have no depth, SingStar 90s is... Oh my god, why are people still playing... You know what, the SingStar games don't look that bad.

609
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:04,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I played it at E3.

610
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:04,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

611
00:33:05,914 --> 00:33:07,676
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had to do Motorhead.

612
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:10,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm more excited.

613
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:16,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Heaven forbid I'm saying I'm excited about a PlayStation 3 game, but I think SingStar will be better on the PlayStation 3 we can download.

614
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:20,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way you don't have all these freaking CD expansion packs, right?

615
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:23,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you for reading my story for me.

616
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:24,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't said anything about what it is.

617
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:36,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what I was going to say is that there actually is some speculation that for the PS3 SingStar there would be some more data for download via the download service.

618
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:44,284
[SPEAKER_13]: But actually SingStar 90s actually was announced for New Zealand stores for August 3rd.

619
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:46,926
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of songs are in this game?

620
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:47,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a song list?

621
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,268
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a gallery.

622
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:51,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, here's a song list.

623
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:59,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Never Ever, All Saints, Barbie Girl, Love Shack, One Week, Achy Breaky Heart with a big fat typo on the page.

624
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:00,837
[SPEAKER_04]: This game already fails.

625
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:02,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Unbelievable.

626
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:03,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that was a good song.

627
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:05,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Here Comes the Hot Stepper.

628
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:07,479
[SPEAKER_13]: It has Stay on it.

629
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:08,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

630
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,379
[SPEAKER_13]: By Shakespeare's Sister?

631
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:10,599
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Lisa Loeb.

632
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, damn it.

633
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,960
[SPEAKER_13]: You Can't Touch This, Bitch, which I don't like that song at all.

634
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:16,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Moving on up.

635
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Torn...

636
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:18,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Step by Step.

637
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:19,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, New Kids on the Block is on it.

638
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:20,434
[SPEAKER_13]: That's cool.

639
00:34:20,674 --> 00:34:21,895
[SPEAKER_04]: This game might be interesting.

640
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:23,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, Where the Wild Roses Go.

641
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:24,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking love that song.

642
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:25,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the Nick Cave song?

643
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:26,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kylie.

644
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:27,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's kind of cool.

645
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,481
[SPEAKER_13]: It has Poison on it.

646
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:31,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Wannabe.

647
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that game will come out in the U.S.

648
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:33,083
[SPEAKER_04]: with that.

649
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:33,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, Radiohead.

650
00:34:35,025 --> 00:34:36,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got one of the Spice Girls.

651
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:40,749
[SPEAKER_13]: It has Savage Garden, Kiss from a Rose, Baby Got Back.

652
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:41,550
[SPEAKER_13]: That's funny.

653
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:44,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Zombies on it.

654
00:34:45,618 --> 00:34:47,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, he's got the cure.

655
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting this game.

656
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:52,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

657
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackboy in our chatroom says, SingStar needs more Bjork.

658
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:56,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

659
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:02,202
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I do a great impression, don't I?

660
00:35:09,955 --> 00:35:11,737
[SPEAKER_12]: What was Margaret Cho's impersonation?

661
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:16,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry that I tried to eat your head.

662
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:22,585
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, there's this YouTube somewhere of, and I know we talked about it on the show before, but it's worth bringing up again.

663
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:23,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that funny.

664
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:29,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Where somebody took, because you know Bjork one time beat the crap out of some reporter in an airport in Thailand.

665
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:33,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, somebody put Street Fighter graphics and music over it, and it's really funny.

666
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:34,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on YouTube somewhere.

667
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure one of the chatters will dig it up somewhere.

668
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:37,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it goes.

669
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:43,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, something else you can find on the internet is a role in a movie!

670
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:45,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing!

671
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:51,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, but I don't know if you really want to be in this movie because it's an Uwe Boll movie.

672
00:35:51,886 --> 00:35:57,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, he's actually auctioning off a role on eBay for a role in Far Cry.

673
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,172
[SPEAKER_04]: The bidding started at 2,498 euros, which would translate to about $3,360 USD.

674
00:36:06,054 --> 00:36:09,015
[SPEAKER_04]: The winner would get five days on the set of the movie.

675
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:13,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, though, they would have to cover the flight and the hotel.

676
00:36:15,176 --> 00:36:17,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So go figure that nobody bid on it.

677
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:19,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

678
00:36:20,497 --> 00:36:21,478
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had the money, I'd do it.

679
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:22,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

680
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:23,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Because.

681
00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:26,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're like, hey, look at that.

682
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in that crappy movie.

683
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:31,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I could say, I was in the movie and it fucking sucked.

684
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:37,149
[SPEAKER_04]: The official eBay page is all in German, so it's kind of hard for me to make out, but it didn't sell.

685
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:37,990
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like it sold.

686
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he sucks.

687
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:45,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Tigerclaw, for finding the Bjork Street Fighter video.

688
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:46,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

689
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,583
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, stories about Uebol make us very angry, so you know what that means, boys and girls.

690
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:56,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the FU's of the Week.

691
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,831
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, start us off.

692
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:13,833
[SPEAKER_13]: What makes me angry?

693
00:37:14,393 --> 00:37:17,615
[SPEAKER_13]: What makes me angry is the check engine light coming on on my car.

694
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:27,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, well, we checked all the emissions, everything was clean, there was no problem with any of that, so I think it just needs new spark plugs.

695
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,282
[SPEAKER_13]: But other than that, it was just really aggravating.

696
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and one other thing, F you to office drama.

697
00:37:36,407 --> 00:37:38,128
[SPEAKER_13]: And new leather smell on my massage table.

698
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, any FUs of the week?

699
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:50,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, FU to the key flash component to VGA thing I've got because it doesn't work.

700
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:57,821
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it doesn't work like it should because, you know, my picture shouldn't be flashing on and off on the screen.

701
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,482
[SPEAKER_02]: That probably would mean it's not working.

702
00:38:00,063 --> 00:38:03,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck them and fuck you for wasting $50 of my money.

703
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:11,490
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm flying out to the East Coast in 48 hours and I haven't done any packing yet.

704
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So FU to myself for not packing yet.

705
00:38:15,171 --> 00:38:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe after tonight's show, we'll see.

706
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

707
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:27,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, back to rumors and speculation.

708
00:38:28,617 --> 00:38:30,658
[SPEAKER_13]: There actually was a...

709
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:38,397
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit from Famitsu announcing that several Metal Gear Solid 20th Anniversary titles were supposed to be out.

710
00:38:38,857 --> 00:38:46,844
[SPEAKER_13]: So they've listed for the 26th of July Metal Gear Solid Collection for PlayStation, PS2, and PSP.

711
00:38:48,045 --> 00:38:51,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Also Metal Gear Solid 3 on PS2.

712
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear Solid 2.

713
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:57,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I just say that?

714
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:58,094
[SPEAKER_13]: They listed it twice.

715
00:38:58,114 --> 00:38:58,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

716
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:09,042
[SPEAKER_13]: There also is Metal Gear Solid for PlayStation and Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops for PSP re-releases, I guess.

717
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:14,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, yay, you can just go to your used video game store and get them.

718
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:17,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they going to redo graphics or anything?

719
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:18,671
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't say anything.

720
00:39:19,072 --> 00:39:19,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame.

721
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:22,155
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just basically repackaged, repriced.

722
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:22,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

723
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:23,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoopie!

724
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:57,269
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I wouldn't discount the fact that something else might come out with it to make it all kind of special, but it doesn't say anything yet.

725
00:39:57,449 --> 00:39:59,990
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I'm not going to put any stock until I get something official.

726
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, something coming soon, or at least a rumor will be coming soon.

727
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:12,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony Erickson, of course, the rumor's been going around saying that there's going to be a PSP phone coming soon.

728
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:30,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently there's been a patent that's been spotted on the US Patent website, and there's some pretty hard evidence there showing kind of a prototype of something that looks like a very thick phone that's going to have a rotatable screen, almost looks like a PSP, just a little bit thicker.

729
00:40:31,593 --> 00:40:32,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting, though.

730
00:40:32,914 --> 00:40:34,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of the same stuff, I think.

731
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:35,237
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing looks stupid.

732
00:40:35,317 --> 00:40:37,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me think of the great phone taco.

733
00:40:58,305 --> 00:40:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: The N-Gage?

734
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:01,647
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a phone taco.

735
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,048
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

736
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:03,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You had an N-Gage?

737
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:04,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I told you I had one.

738
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,550
[SPEAKER_13]: They gave us one for free.

739
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Loser.

740
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,213
[SPEAKER_13]: It was free and we gave it away.

741
00:41:09,493 --> 00:41:10,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheap loser.

742
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

743
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:14,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's what it would be.

744
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:15,598
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes more sense.

745
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:24,104
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like what would happen is you'd actually have your directional button and stuff like you'd normally have on a phone.

746
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:30,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then that whole screen would flip around and then you would have kind of like a PSP looking thing.

747
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:32,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat.

748
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:34,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that would work very well.

749
00:41:34,276 --> 00:41:37,097
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks unwieldy and kind of crappy like the Blackberries do.

750
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:39,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

751
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:41,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, PSPs aren't that expensive.

752
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stick with the PSP.

753
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:44,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn the PSP into a phone.

754
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:45,022
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

755
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:47,684
[SPEAKER_13]: How about get a phone, get a PSP?

756
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:52,727
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I would rather have a phone that I can do two things on.

757
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:54,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, call people.

758
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:55,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, text message.

759
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:56,824
[SPEAKER_13]: That's frickin' it.

760
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:58,425
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I paid 30 bucks for my phone.

761
00:41:59,006 --> 00:41:59,866
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a nice phone.

762
00:42:00,947 --> 00:42:05,029
[SPEAKER_13]: But if I want to play a video game, then I'll just get something that's dedicated to video games.

763
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:12,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take pictures with my phone, which is fine because I have a camera and all, but sometimes you can take pictures with your camera phone when people don't know it.

764
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:15,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that would be a number three.

765
00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:16,697
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be a number three.

766
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:21,680
[SPEAKER_13]: But seriously, this iPhone crap and this PSP phone crap, why don't you just...

767
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:24,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Get a PSP or get an iPod.

768
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,240
[SPEAKER_13]: How hard is it?

769
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,921
[SPEAKER_02]: PSPs are pretty large, too.

770
00:42:27,941 --> 00:42:29,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't really want to use it as a phone.

771
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:33,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, if somebody gave me an iPhone, I wouldn't disagree.

772
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Or if I got a big fat discount on one, I wouldn't disagree.

773
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:41,708
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was not something that I think is worth $600 for, and neither would this PSP phone thing be.

774
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:45,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a phone that works, and I have one PSP.

775
00:42:46,943 --> 00:43:15,517
[SPEAKER_13]: and I have a bunch of DS's so I can just play whatever you can probably buy a pretty nice phone for $600 I'd like to think my phone is pretty nice it was only $200 a year ago I could buy like a full GPS system with you know built in headphones to talk to anybody in the world for enough money but you know why would I want to do that I have my phone I think that all of this is ridiculous it's just because people are tech addicts and need to have something that does more than it needs to do

776
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:21,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, you know, on that PSP, you could play this.

777
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:28,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Also being reported in Famitsu is that a new version of Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins is coming out for the PSP.

778
00:43:29,154 --> 00:43:32,135
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out in Japan, and they're redoing it.

779
00:43:32,775 --> 00:43:35,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be kind of making the game a little closer to its arcade roots.

780
00:43:36,696 --> 00:43:43,637
[SPEAKER_04]: The number of continues is going to be limited, and players will be forced to complete the game twice before seeing the ending.

781
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:44,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So it

782
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,457
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, they've made this game even harder than it was before.

783
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:50,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

784
00:43:50,979 --> 00:43:52,000
[SPEAKER_13]: It was pretty hard before.

785
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

786
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:54,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Ghosts and Goblins, it better be hard.

787
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:58,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So August 2nd is the day the game is coming out.

788
00:43:58,524 --> 00:44:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: No import plans announced yet for the game to come out in North America, but we can all hold our breath.

789
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:06,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we'll get it.

790
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure it'll be dumbed down and made easy, just like most of the games they bring over from Japan.

791
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:10,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

792
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:12,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we'll die first.

793
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:13,655
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

794
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:16,828
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story, then we're going to get to our Skype line.

795
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:20,950
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can call us.

796
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is our username.

797
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, two more stories.

798
00:44:24,231 --> 00:44:26,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is our username on Skype.

799
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:28,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Two more stories, my bad.

800
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:39,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, at any rate, you remember the whole Second Life exploitation that was going on?

801
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:42,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't we cover that last week?

802
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:43,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it involve cock-throwing?

803
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:44,562
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

804
00:44:45,963 --> 00:45:07,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, at any rate, a Pennsylvania attorney is taking Linden Labs to court because she's saying that they illegally took away the items that were supposed to have been acquired during, let me see the quote, allegedly acquired using an exploit by an SL user.

805
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:13,024
[SPEAKER_13]: He was banned, lost everything, and the

806
00:45:13,832 --> 00:45:17,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Court actually is denying the request to dismiss the case.

807
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:18,893
[SPEAKER_13]: They've denied it twice.

808
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:25,675
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a big quote on here that says, The case will still need to play out and only concerns the sum of $8,000.

809
00:45:25,915 --> 00:45:34,318
[SPEAKER_13]: However, it appears that greater scrutiny and enforcement of commerce within Second Life and other virtual worlds is possible and may be necessary.

810
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:41,960
[SPEAKER_13]: The commerce, largely characterized by pyramid schemes, faulty valuations, and unreal exchange rates could be subject to real-world law.

811
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,460
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

812
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:46,386
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you make third life.

813
00:45:47,687 --> 00:45:49,348
[SPEAKER_02]: But second life is too real for you.

814
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:50,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to third life.

815
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:55,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone steals all my equipment in World of Warcraft, I can like sue them over it?

816
00:45:55,472 --> 00:45:57,954
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be kind of cool, I guess.

817
00:45:58,515 --> 00:45:58,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

818
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:00,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

819
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:06,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm suing you for vandalizing my building by throwing cocks at it.

820
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:08,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you.

821
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn you to hell.

822
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:11,584
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone threw cocks at me, I'd sue them.

823
00:46:14,029 --> 00:46:15,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking I should sue these guys.

824
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Codemasters.

825
00:46:19,212 --> 00:46:25,615
[SPEAKER_02]: They never seem to fail me when it comes to thinking up video game ideas.

826
00:46:25,935 --> 00:46:28,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They're creating Dirty Dancing, the video game.

827
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:30,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right, Dirty Dancing.

828
00:46:32,178 --> 00:46:37,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a wonderful game, and I don't know what the hell they could be doing with this.

829
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:43,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Neat idea if they pull it off, but I really wish they'd put this baby in the corner.

830
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,120
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's kind of late.

831
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,041
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to put her down.

832
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:49,001
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to put her down.

833
00:46:49,401 --> 00:47:03,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently it says working alongside a team at Kellerman's Resort playthrough, a fantastic variety of fun mini-games, earned camp dollars to purchase Dirty Dancing memorabilia, cabin furnishings, and all-important dance lessons with Johnny and Penny.

834
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:07,165
[SPEAKER_02]: How will you fare in the end-of-the-season dance contest?

835
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:13,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they already try bringing back the Dirty Dancing franchise with that Havana Nights movie or whatever it was that tanked?

836
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it tanked, but yeah.

837
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with WonderDogCarol.

838
00:47:19,122 --> 00:47:22,043
[SPEAKER_04]: WonderDogCarol says, I want Mannequin the video game.

839
00:47:23,544 --> 00:47:24,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.

840
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:26,625
[SPEAKER_04]: With that one guy with the glasses?

841
00:47:26,665 --> 00:47:27,585
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell was his name?

842
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:32,527
[SPEAKER_04]: The really flamey guy in the movie that was like the assist... Oh, God.

843
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I know somebody's going to yell it in chat.

844
00:47:35,368 --> 00:47:35,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it.

845
00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:38,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to see.

846
00:47:39,029 --> 00:47:39,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Mannequin the video game.

847
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:40,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

848
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:44,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirty Dancing the Game, DarkSakura, Hollywood, BlackBoy

849
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:05,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get to the Skype line, shall we?

850
00:48:05,652 --> 00:48:12,296
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

851
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:16,059
[SPEAKER_04]: The phones are now open for business, so give us a call.

852
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,481
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just sit here and wait.

853
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:21,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great, we got some calls coming in already.

854
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:23,024
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of a delay, so it takes a minute.

855
00:48:23,424 --> 00:48:25,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

856
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you already know this Legend of Zaku.

857
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Zaku, how you doing?

858
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:35,913
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about, now I know you're into cell phone games, what do you think about Legion Suit Larry on the mobile phones?

859
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:47,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I haven't seen it yet, but I would assume it has to be, you know, it has to be like text and graphics based, where you just have to like, you know, it's like basically text and images based.

860
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:55,545
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically the whole... It's just the whole premise of cell phone games just to garner the casual gamer's attention.

861
00:48:55,585 --> 00:48:58,546
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, if it works out, that's great.

862
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some pixelated boobies, who knows?

863
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:02,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, what did you call in about tonight, Zaku?

864
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:10,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, just random stuff like the fact that, um... I forgot what I was going to say, um...

865
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:20,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's like, I don't know, just getting, you know, about Tekken 6 and the fact that, you know, all the rumors about it going to 360.

866
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:26,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just in general of how the state of affairs is with, you know, with trying to make games.

867
00:49:28,352 --> 00:49:31,613
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting to lose exclusives because everything's going multi-platform.

868
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:37,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask DarkSakura a little bit about this because you're right, we didn't talk about Tekken 6 tonight at all.

869
00:49:37,795 --> 00:49:38,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It just kind of missed our show role.

870
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:41,031
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

871
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:01,525
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll look a little bit better, play a little bit better.

872
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:04,346
[SPEAKER_13]: And that and Namco has just been all about Sony.

873
00:50:04,506 --> 00:50:06,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

874
00:50:06,828 --> 00:50:09,289
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you also have Ace Combat 6, which is 360.

875
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:15,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a time exclusive, which the PS3 version will come afterwards.

876
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:16,793
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like the inverse.

877
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:21,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably also helps that the Tekken 6 arcade hardware is built off the PlayStation 3.

878
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:25,537
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably pretty simple to port it over to the PlayStation 3.

879
00:50:25,577 --> 00:50:27,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It might take a little longer for Xbox 360, but...

880
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:29,973
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not dumb.

881
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:33,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they're going to put it over on the 360 at some point.

882
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:41,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you looked at the recent Mini E3, you know, lineup list that they had, apparently, you know, I don't know.

883
00:50:41,344 --> 00:50:46,749
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like all I see is like very few exclusive, you know, PS3 games from other companies.

884
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:50,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously, Sony's the only one making their own PS3 games.

885
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:51,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, who knows, though?

886
00:50:51,494 --> 00:50:53,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony may have some surprises in store.

887
00:50:53,315 --> 00:50:53,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't really...

888
00:50:54,116 --> 00:51:00,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, usually the announcements about what we're going to see at E3 is shit we already know about that was delayed from last year.

889
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:09,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, a lot of it's going to be surprises, but I'm assuming if E3 operates any similar way this year that it did last year, which I'm assuming will be the same thing.

890
00:51:09,085 --> 00:51:11,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Chances are it's going to be much smaller, much more closed.

891
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:18,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, besides that, I mean, the way the news works, you know, I think that'll still kind of pretty much be the same.

892
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:20,412
[SPEAKER_07]: The big boys who get in will have to feed off of them eventually.

893
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:21,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, you know.

894
00:51:23,058 --> 00:51:25,819
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, the rest of the internet will get fed up with it, but we'll just wait.

895
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,001
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, anyway, Zaku, anything else on your mind before we take some other calls?

896
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:30,541
[SPEAKER_07]: That's about it.

897
00:51:31,462 --> 00:51:34,343
[SPEAKER_07]: We New Yorkers have 2DX Happy Sky in the arcades.

898
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:36,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, where at?

899
00:51:36,404 --> 00:51:42,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Same place where we find the only pop music machine in the city, Peter Pan Games in Queens.

900
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:44,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to look that place up while I'm out there.

901
00:51:44,408 --> 00:51:44,708
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

902
00:51:45,288 --> 00:51:45,568
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

903
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:46,389
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, later, Zaku.

904
00:51:47,049 --> 00:51:47,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

905
00:51:48,413 --> 00:51:53,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

906
00:51:53,415 --> 00:51:55,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones and take another call.

907
00:51:56,816 --> 00:51:58,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

908
00:51:58,977 --> 00:51:59,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

909
00:51:59,938 --> 00:52:01,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.

910
00:52:01,378 --> 00:52:02,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma, how you doing?

911
00:52:02,459 --> 00:52:03,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

912
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:05,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.

913
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,920
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you enjoy your trip out to California?

914
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:08,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was fucking awesome.

915
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:09,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.

916
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:10,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

917
00:52:10,222 --> 00:52:11,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're having a hard time hearing you, Ranma.

918
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:12,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a little closer to your microphone.

919
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:15,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I said I had fun and I enjoyed it very much.

920
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:19,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to somehow make my way out there for a weekend just to have fun.

921
00:52:19,771 --> 00:52:20,932
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a fun bunch here.

922
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:22,332
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to call in and talk about tonight?

923
00:52:22,913 --> 00:52:25,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things everybody's been bitching on me about are pictures.

924
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:30,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm posting a link in the chat room right now for the pictures.

925
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:33,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do you have pictures of the panel and stuff?

926
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few pictures of the panel.

927
00:52:35,299 --> 00:52:35,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

928
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:43,024
[SPEAKER_01]: It's djranmas.mypockybox.com My Pocky Box?

929
00:52:43,984 --> 00:52:44,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mypockybox.com

930
00:52:46,394 --> 00:52:49,175
[SPEAKER_01]: forward slash gallery forward slash Fondame 2007.

931
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:51,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

932
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:54,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at some of the pictures right now.

933
00:52:54,396 --> 00:52:56,117
[SPEAKER_04]: You got tons and tons of cosplayers.

934
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:57,978
[SPEAKER_04]: What was some of your favorite cosplay you saw?

935
00:52:59,038 --> 00:53:09,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I don't have to be biased, but I was really going for the Ranma 1.5 cosplays because there's been a while where not many people are cosplaying that series, but now lately, this is making one hell of a comeback.

936
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:12,802
[SPEAKER_04]: The series is kind of old, though, right?

937
00:53:13,502 --> 00:53:16,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but great series like that never go old.

938
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:23,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you know, one of the favorite pieces of cosplay I saw was actually Jonas, who's been on OLR before.

939
00:53:24,015 --> 00:53:24,975
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been on this program before.

940
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:26,795
[SPEAKER_04]: He cosplayed as a Wii remote.

941
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:28,176
[SPEAKER_04]: That was him?

942
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:29,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was him.

943
00:53:29,636 --> 00:53:30,676
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

944
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:37,478
[SPEAKER_04]: He was actually going to come to the show tonight, but I don't think he got the address in time of where we're at now, because we've been in like four different studios.

945
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:38,638
[SPEAKER_04]: He hasn't been on the show in a long time.

946
00:53:38,938 --> 00:53:40,959
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that was one of my favorite pieces of cosplay.

947
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:43,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, there's the Dolphy pictures.

948
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's the OLR panel.

949
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are.

950
00:53:47,034 --> 00:53:49,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Sky, who are you choking in this picture?

951
00:53:50,656 --> 00:53:51,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?

952
00:53:51,156 --> 00:53:51,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look.

953
00:53:52,237 --> 00:53:52,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 124.

954
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:53,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I just posted it.

955
00:53:54,718 --> 00:53:55,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to look.

956
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Who am I choking in this picture?

957
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:58,901
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Drew Nami.

958
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:01,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought Drew Nami was on the other side.

959
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:02,603
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's Drew.

960
00:54:04,164 --> 00:54:04,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

961
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:07,045
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a bunch of Orange Lounge Radio listeners there.

962
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:07,505
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

963
00:54:07,686 --> 00:54:08,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

964
00:54:08,186 --> 00:54:08,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

965
00:54:08,906 --> 00:54:09,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

966
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,848
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends, Ken, he took the picture for all of us.

967
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:20,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know you took a picture of my Dolphies on the table.

968
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you asked me to do it.

969
00:54:23,534 --> 00:54:25,315
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the one in the hotel room.

970
00:54:26,056 --> 00:54:26,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

971
00:54:26,716 --> 00:54:27,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought you knew about that one.

972
00:54:28,638 --> 00:54:29,498
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's cool.

973
00:54:29,518 --> 00:54:30,019
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good picture.

974
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:31,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sweet.

975
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,862
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anything else you want to share with us, Ranma?

976
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:38,379
[SPEAKER_01]: The last picture of you and William together in the chat room, the one that everybody loves.

977
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:39,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

978
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:40,459
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very sweet.

979
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, is that in the gallery?

980
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you putting personal pictures?

981
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:44,561
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

982
00:54:44,601 --> 00:54:46,442
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my trip picture still.

983
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:52,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I see, because at the very end, oh, yeah, DarkSakura's pinball, all that stuff at her house, all the crazy pinball at her place.

984
00:54:53,245 --> 00:54:54,085
[SPEAKER_04]: There's my friend John.

985
00:54:54,145 --> 00:54:54,625
[SPEAKER_04]: How funny.

986
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:59,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So I decided next year, though, that I'm going to do Lolita Mario.

987
00:55:00,888 --> 00:55:02,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, the Gachamon cosplayers, that's great.

988
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:03,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

989
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:07,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well Ranma, thanks so much for coming out here.

990
00:55:07,436 --> 00:55:16,982
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a true fan, pretty hardcore, for coming out all the way to California to see the Orange Lounge panel and hang with us and go to Fatame and all that too, but you're just awesome, that's all.

991
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:19,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, plus it was my birthday the day before.

992
00:55:20,308 --> 00:55:22,749
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a version of a giant birthday gift to myself.

993
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:23,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew, that.

994
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, happy late birthday a little bit.

995
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:26,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll see you.

996
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:28,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be seeing you this weekend, the coming weekend.

997
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:29,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.

998
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:34,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be posting a post in the forum so we can get things cracking for that.

999
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:37,032
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just make sure it happens Sunday afternoon because that's the time I got.

1000
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,072
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sounds good.

1001
00:55:38,092 --> 00:55:38,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1002
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:38,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1003
00:55:39,532 --> 00:55:39,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1004
00:55:40,732 --> 00:55:42,813
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go to some more calls.

1005
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:44,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1006
00:55:44,593 --> 00:55:44,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1007
00:55:46,215 --> 00:55:47,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Raven Stolfen!

1008
00:55:47,256 --> 00:55:49,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Raven Stolfen, what's on your mind?

1009
00:55:50,358 --> 00:55:51,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Match Game.

1010
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what about Match Game?

1011
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:08,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know if you realize, but in GSM, when they used to do Match Game online, and I was really good at it, and I got on the board on TV that said your name on it, I was heavily addicted to that for a long, long time.

1012
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:09,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't they still do that?

1013
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:13,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but Comcast being dicks, they took off my...

1014
00:56:14,198 --> 00:56:17,220
[SPEAKER_10]: took off GSN entirely down here, and I'm pissed.

1015
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that sucks.

1016
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

1017
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

1018
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:30,767
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't talk a whole lot about casual games on the show, certainly, but that's pretty cool that they have the, you know, you can play along with the game shows and stuff.

1019
00:56:30,827 --> 00:56:31,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually never done that.

1020
00:56:31,907 --> 00:56:32,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I should sometime.

1021
00:56:32,568 --> 00:56:34,749
[SPEAKER_04]: I love myself some game show networks, so there you go.

1022
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:46,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but we cheated sometimes because some people watched it so many times they'd write down the answers and it was posted up in the chat room and we would get on the leaderboard every time.

1023
00:56:46,658 --> 00:56:47,099
[SPEAKER_10]: It was great.

1024
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:48,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1025
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,081
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do you want to share with us tonight?

1026
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:53,663
[SPEAKER_10]: What else do I want to share with you tonight?

1027
00:56:53,763 --> 00:56:54,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1028
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:56,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

1029
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:58,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to point that out.

1030
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:02,028
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about it.

1031
00:57:02,448 --> 00:57:03,669
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no one more thing tonight?

1032
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I updated my website.

1033
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to hear about that?

1034
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:09,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, why not?

1035
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:10,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheap website plug.

1036
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:10,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

1037
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:11,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it quick.

1038
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:13,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Checkinggame.com.

1039
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I just remembered what I want to talk to you about.

1040
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,480
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there you go.

1041
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:16,660
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1042
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1043
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Hotel Dusk, Ring 215.

1044
00:57:22,202 --> 00:57:24,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know much about, well, I mean, I take that back.

1045
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I know about the game.

1046
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:31,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played the game because it's just one of those games that is, you know, I can't play every game that comes out.

1047
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:32,605
[SPEAKER_04]: What about it, though?

1048
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:36,988
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like Phoenix Wright, but I enjoy it.

1049
00:57:37,148 --> 00:57:38,909
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was very enjoyable.

1050
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:40,550
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes it so enjoyable?

1051
00:57:41,952 --> 00:57:47,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you play this guy called Kyle Hyde, and he goes to this place, and the room is magical.

1052
00:57:47,116 --> 00:57:49,618
[SPEAKER_10]: So this room grants wishes.

1053
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:53,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So he goes in there, he doesn't know anything, and I'm not going to spoil anything.

1054
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:58,225
[SPEAKER_10]: So he goes in there, and he's trying to find something out about his friend.

1055
00:57:58,585 --> 00:58:02,048
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very interesting how all this comes together.

1056
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:03,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1057
00:58:03,665 --> 00:58:08,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I know Miklatov has the game, so I'll have to borrow it from him at some point and give a more fair review on the show later.

1058
00:58:10,351 --> 00:58:19,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's very enjoyable, I thought, but there's a lot of reading, so for you people that hate Super Paper Mario, you're probably going to hate this too.

1059
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:21,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hate Super Paper Mario because it's too much reading, Loki?

1060
00:58:23,354 --> 00:58:23,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1061
00:58:51,075 --> 00:58:53,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, anything else real quick, Ranma?

1062
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, not Ranma, Raven's Dolphin.

1063
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at Ranma's pictures in the background.

1064
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:58,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else, Raven's Dolphin?

1065
00:58:58,699 --> 00:58:59,019
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1066
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just updated my website, and I just want people to know how it looks.

1067
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:05,203
[SPEAKER_10]: TechieGames.com Alright, there it is.

1068
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:07,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, thank you so much for the phone call.

1069
00:59:07,364 --> 00:59:08,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, okay?

1070
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:08,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, definitely.

1071
00:59:08,985 --> 00:59:09,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1072
00:59:09,265 --> 00:59:09,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye.

1073
00:59:10,386 --> 00:59:15,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1074
00:59:15,689 --> 00:59:16,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1075
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:17,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1076
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is BlackDevilRx.

1077
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:21,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, BlackDevilerX, what's on your mind?

1078
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, not much.

1079
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:27,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm trying to get a Wii.

1080
00:59:30,345 --> 00:59:31,785
[SPEAKER_06]: San Francisco seems to be out of Wiis.

1081
00:59:32,446 --> 00:59:37,189
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, so does Sacramento and a lot of areas seem to still be out of Wiis after all this time.

1082
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:39,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, you can give us a distribution angle here, I suppose.

1083
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:40,831
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell's going on?

1084
00:59:41,251 --> 00:59:43,593
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still some coming in, it's just, it's slow.

1085
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:47,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still, everything's under, you know, allocations and everything.

1086
00:59:48,103 --> 00:59:50,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a particular time that's best to check?

1087
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:53,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Sunday mornings seem to be pretty good.

1088
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:56,811
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not really.

1089
00:59:57,131 --> 01:00:02,836
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of places are keeping them under wraps until Sundays when they put out their ads.

1090
01:00:02,936 --> 01:00:03,436
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why.

1091
01:00:03,977 --> 01:00:05,458
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of retail chains.

1092
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:08,301
[SPEAKER_06]: EB Games hasn't seen one for two weeks.

1093
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:10,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1094
01:00:10,683 --> 01:00:12,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you still do pre-orders with these guys?

1095
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:14,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do they not do that anymore?

1096
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:17,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1097
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:24,523
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of hesitate to do stuff online because I kind of had a real bad experience with it, but I suppose that's one thing I could do.

1098
01:00:24,903 --> 01:00:25,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1099
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:29,346
[SPEAKER_04]: James Patrick in chat says, My Toys R Us got 200 of them on Memorial Day.

1100
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:30,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there trying to get one.

1101
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:32,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Sold out in 30 minutes.

1102
01:00:33,688 --> 01:00:34,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

1103
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:35,870
[SPEAKER_04]: My God.

1104
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,150
[SPEAKER_04]: After all this time?

1105
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:37,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

1106
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:38,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1107
01:00:39,488 --> 01:00:43,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that just goes to show, Wii's still a pretty darn successful system.

1108
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:43,710
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty amazing.

1109
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:44,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

1110
01:00:44,351 --> 01:00:46,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get one for myself, like, kind of as a graduation present.

1111
01:00:46,932 --> 01:00:48,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what have you been playing since you're Wii-less?

1112
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:53,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I've been playing a lot of Super Smash Bros.

1113
01:00:53,095 --> 01:00:53,716
[SPEAKER_06]: on the GameCube.

1114
01:00:54,256 --> 01:00:54,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there you go.

1115
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:57,418
[SPEAKER_04]: In anticipation for the new one on the Wii someday?

1116
01:00:57,938 --> 01:00:58,278
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1117
01:00:58,298 --> 01:01:05,662
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about all the stuff they've announced on the site recently, like the musicians and the power-ups and all that, and using the GameCube controller?

1118
01:01:06,277 --> 01:01:10,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't actually checked out the site lately, but I've heard that Snake's going to be in there, which is kind of cool.

1119
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,061
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, very cool.

1120
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they have more of those single-player type modes.

1121
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:18,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how they had the old-school Mario level that you played Mario?

1122
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:19,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1123
01:01:19,225 --> 01:01:20,406
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff was so cool.

1124
01:01:20,726 --> 01:01:21,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they have more of that.

1125
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:25,929
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, BlackDevilerX, thank you so much for the call, and good luck on your hunt for a Wii.

1126
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:27,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Try Sunday mornings.

1127
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:27,970
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best advice we got.

1128
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:28,711
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1129
01:01:28,871 --> 01:01:29,491
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, later, dude.

1130
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:30,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1131
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1132
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:40,232
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would like to give us a call, you can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1133
01:01:40,593 --> 01:01:47,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take one more call here and then we're going to go ahead and call it a night on the Skype line and do some last minute stories.

1134
01:01:47,618 --> 01:01:50,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it does seem to me it's been kind of a slow news week, huh?

1135
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:51,582
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

1136
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Compared to usual.

1137
01:01:53,103 --> 01:01:54,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's because Memorial Day kind of got in the way.

1138
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:58,167
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of folks, video game employees want to go camping too.

1139
01:01:58,908 --> 01:01:59,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1140
01:02:00,089 --> 01:02:00,409
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1141
01:02:00,962 --> 01:02:01,823
[SPEAKER_04]: No other calls coming in?

1142
01:02:01,863 --> 01:02:03,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw some others hitting on the line.

1143
01:02:03,364 --> 01:02:04,565
[SPEAKER_12]: God, my pinball room is hot.

1144
01:02:05,785 --> 01:02:06,366
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

1145
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:12,550
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's pictures of my garage with my amazing washing machine with my laundry in it.

1146
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:15,012
[SPEAKER_04]: There's pictures of my huge ass on there.

1147
01:02:15,112 --> 01:02:16,172
[SPEAKER_04]: God, it looks horrible.

1148
01:02:18,494 --> 01:02:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: My ass doesn't look so bad in that picture.

1149
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:21,336
[SPEAKER_13]: You see that Rocky and Bullinkle machine?

1150
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:21,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

1151
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:22,597
[SPEAKER_13]: That's mine.

1152
01:02:23,317 --> 01:02:24,158
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an awesome machine.

1153
01:02:24,218 --> 01:02:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1154
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:27,540
[SPEAKER_13]: The Twilight Zone is mine, too, because the play board was made on my birthday.

1155
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:29,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I wish they would have gotten a shot of the...

1156
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:32,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Dark Knight, it's just a timing thing.

1157
01:02:32,252 --> 01:02:39,956
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that there were a bunch of people trying to get through, and then nobody for a minute and a half, and we're sitting here going...

1158
01:02:59,594 --> 01:03:00,935
[SPEAKER_04]: While you got through, what's on your mind, buddy?

1159
01:03:02,096 --> 01:03:08,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I wanted to talk about something I posted on the website recently about a price cut of Lumenfall's next-gen system.

1160
01:03:09,623 --> 01:03:09,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1161
01:03:12,845 --> 01:03:17,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I would think that I knew it was coming, but this early was kind of a shocker.

1162
01:03:17,889 --> 01:03:19,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Being this early was kind of a big shocker to me.

1163
01:03:20,512 --> 01:03:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what about me again?

1164
01:03:21,072 --> 01:03:21,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you were breaking up a little.

1165
01:03:21,993 --> 01:03:22,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You say price cuts?

1166
01:03:23,654 --> 01:03:26,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they said there might be a possible next-gen price cut.

1167
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:30,741
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes this information more substantial?

1168
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:37,044
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, it seems like every month we're getting some rumor of an upcoming price cut, and we have yet to really see a big one.

1169
01:03:38,204 --> 01:03:46,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, basically, the latest I got was that they said that Microsoft was going to go first at the end of the summer, and like a $50 drop.

1170
01:03:47,395 --> 01:03:52,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I would honestly think Microsoft's in a safe place right now until Sony drops their... Well, I don't know.

1171
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Microsoft wants to try and get down there to compete with the Wii a little more.

1172
01:03:56,063 --> 01:04:00,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Because honestly, if they dropped their core by $50, they'd be the same price as a Wii, right?

1173
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:02,149
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what it was intended.

1174
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,153
[SPEAKER_11]: They wanted it to be at least the same price as a Wii, the core.

1175
01:04:06,653 --> 01:04:07,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why not.

1176
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:08,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems to make a lot of sense.

1177
01:04:08,835 --> 01:04:09,636
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Loki?

1178
01:04:09,676 --> 01:04:12,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I want your angle on this because you're kind of on the inside in this.

1179
01:04:13,126 --> 01:04:19,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think that they have any firm plans on dropping any price, but obviously they're probably going to be ready to if other companies do it.

1180
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:23,789
[SPEAKER_02]: But some console makers are probably going to have to drop the price of their system.

1181
01:04:24,049 --> 01:04:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, all these analysts just saying, oh, there's a price drop coming.

1182
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a price drop coming eventually.

1183
01:04:29,111 --> 01:04:32,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just trying to get out there and say, hey, see, we called it.

1184
01:04:32,652 --> 01:04:34,732
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really good at analyzing stuff.

1185
01:04:34,812 --> 01:04:35,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at us.

1186
01:04:35,673 --> 01:04:36,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say...

1187
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:38,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're analysts, too, of sorts.

1188
01:04:38,946 --> 01:04:41,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, what do we do on this show for the past five years, right?

1189
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:46,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say if a price cut's coming, it's going to be just before the Christmas rush.

1190
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:50,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say, honestly, price cuts, I think end of summer's a good call.

1191
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:51,629
[SPEAKER_04]: September.

1192
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say you're going to see some massive price cuts in September.

1193
01:04:54,649 --> 01:04:56,809
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I say, maybe like 50 bucks.

1194
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,610
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 bucks on the 360 and the Wii, maybe, even.

1195
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:06,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if it's... The source I got it from, they said Nintendo might not, would probably not think about it.

1196
01:05:06,977 --> 01:05:10,838
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe like just maybe the 360 and the PS3, possibly.

1197
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,738
[SPEAKER_04]: What if Nintendo announced this?

1198
01:05:12,858 --> 01:05:15,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we still know the Wii's are coming in different colors, right?

1199
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:16,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1200
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,280
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they release the Wii's in different colors with no game included?

1201
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:20,280
$199.

1202
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,380
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1203
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that would be good.

1204
01:05:24,081 --> 01:05:24,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1205
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:29,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I could do it right there or put in some other type of pack in like, I don't know, demos or I don't know.

1206
01:05:30,002 --> 01:05:33,523
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, just take Wii Sports out of the picture, charge $199 for the colored Wii's.

1207
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I could probably see that happening.

1208
01:05:36,723 --> 01:05:38,404
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1209
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:45,945
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I knew it was coming, but I kind of figured maybe you might see it like maybe another year at least.

1210
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you, by September, $50 price cuts on Wii and 360, $100 price cut on PS3.

1211
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:50,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1212
01:05:50,266 --> 01:05:51,186
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was a Batman, there it is.

1213
01:05:51,206 --> 01:05:52,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I say a $100 price cut on PS3.

1214
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:53,887
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to.

1215
01:05:53,907 --> 01:05:54,347
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to.

1216
01:06:00,283 --> 01:06:12,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, they don't have to, actually, because what they could do is just, since they've already dropped their 60 gig or whatever, drop the 80 gig at the same price as their 60 and maybe do... Throw in a game or something to make it.

1217
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:17,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, not necessarily throw it in a game, but do the 20 gig price for the 60 gig now.

1218
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:21,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then if they don't cut it by 100, they'll put something in there to sweeten the deal.

1219
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:29,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll drop it by 50, but put $50 worth of extra crap in it, like another game, the hard drive increase, like you're saying, something like that.

1220
01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:36,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, worst case scenario is that if, like I said, PlayStation 3 does make that cut, you're probably going to see the PS2 hit the $99 mark.

1221
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I saw the thing, and I was like,

1222
01:06:57,714 --> 01:06:59,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe you told that.

1223
01:07:01,436 --> 01:07:05,158
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, thank you so much, Dark Knight, for your call, and we'll see what happens on the price cut front.

1224
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:05,939
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?

1225
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:07,240
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.

1226
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,000
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, take care, buddy.

1227
01:07:08,841 --> 01:07:09,041
Bye.

1228
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:12,803
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1229
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:15,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Going on to some... Lots and lots of comments from chat here.

1230
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:15,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1231
01:07:15,925 --> 01:07:20,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob D. says, I wouldn't be enjoying my 360 half as much if I wasn't a member of an online community.

1232
01:07:20,888 --> 01:07:24,650
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii doesn't really have much of anything going for it at the moment beyond the virtual console.

1233
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, interesting.

1234
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:56,154
[SPEAKER_04]: James Patrick says PlayStation 2 won't drop to $99 for a while Sony needs the profit from its current price let's see James Patrick says PlayStation 3 sales are in the gutter that needs to increase software wise I mean hardware is important too but software is what counts Blackboy says the 360 has been out considerably longer than the Wii but in terms of sales Wii is outselling 360 by crazy amounts

1235
01:07:57,315 --> 01:07:59,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting perspectives there in chat.

1236
01:07:59,716 --> 01:08:03,038
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackDevilerX says, We're using the Dreamcast as the minimum bar for sales.

1237
01:08:04,939 --> 01:08:05,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1238
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:06,240
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1239
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:14,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, if you have more comments, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelondradio.com, and we'll read those emails next week.

1240
01:08:14,705 --> 01:08:19,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, not next week, but in two weeks on the program, because a reminder, there will be no show next week.

1241
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:21,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and see if there's any last-minute stories.

1242
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I found something interesting.

1243
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:30,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Just some early pictures of the Guitar Hero 3 Les Paul controller.

1244
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty freaking cool.

1245
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:34,271
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so special about it?

1246
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:38,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they've done two other Gibson guitars.

1247
01:08:38,172 --> 01:08:42,393
[SPEAKER_13]: They did probably one of, in my opinion, one of their best.

1248
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:47,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I'm going to link the article in the chat room so they can see the pictures.

1249
01:08:47,634 --> 01:08:49,274
[SPEAKER_13]: It actually looks really sweet, and the buttons on it...

1250
01:08:49,975 --> 01:08:52,498
[SPEAKER_13]: are black with the colored outlines.

1251
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:55,781
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really a lot different than the other controllers have looked.

1252
01:08:57,282 --> 01:08:59,184
[SPEAKER_13]: More minimalist.

1253
01:09:01,386 --> 01:09:01,786
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1254
01:09:03,908 --> 01:09:04,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

1255
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:05,270
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1256
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:06,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1257
01:09:07,972 --> 01:09:11,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so I actually got quite a few things.

1258
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:14,558
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, some interesting stuff coming out.

1259
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:22,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first off, there's supposed to be a rumor that the next issue of EGM is going to reveal a brand new Soul Calibur title.

1260
01:09:23,223 --> 01:09:25,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Soul Calibur Legends, I'm guessing.

1261
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, who knows, maybe they're doing that again.

1262
01:09:28,525 --> 01:09:30,785
[SPEAKER_04]: We could use the next gen Soul Calibur game, that'd be pretty awesome.

1263
01:09:30,805 --> 01:09:35,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a new Soul Calibur game possibly being announced, so that'd be kind of neat.

1264
01:09:36,147 --> 01:09:43,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Another rumor that's going on, apparently a website, RPG Gamer, had an interview with NS America, and...

1265
01:09:44,654 --> 01:09:52,220
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions was, or according to the Q&A, one of the answers to a question, is Disgaea coming into any other platforms?

1266
01:09:52,701 --> 01:09:53,621
[SPEAKER_02]: They mentioned the DS.

1267
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:56,263
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might get Disgaea on the DS soon.

1268
01:09:58,565 --> 01:09:59,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1269
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:05,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's an interesting thing going on.

1270
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:07,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, certain...

1271
01:10:10,046 --> 01:10:13,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Lawyer type by the name of Jack was supposed to be... Voldemort?

1272
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:14,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean Lord Voldemort?

1273
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:23,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Voldemort was apparently going to be debating or participating in a debate during PAX this year.

1274
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:28,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this was supposed to be kept under wraps and no word if he's going to back out of that one.

1275
01:10:28,973 --> 01:10:32,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I had heard he already did because he put out some retort to... He thought it was...

1276
01:10:33,413 --> 01:10:33,933
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.com.

1277
01:11:01,813 --> 01:11:07,074
[SPEAKER_02]: and VideoOut for playing on your television as well as SD card for game storage and etc.

1278
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:12,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of nifty to see him actually making a console instead of modding them.

1279
01:11:12,915 --> 01:11:18,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking about homebrew stuff, there was a game I talked about on the show a while back called No Gravity.

1280
01:11:19,016 --> 01:11:21,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a Descent Free Space type game.

1281
01:11:21,456 --> 01:11:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I showed it to you, Rob, one time.

1282
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:29,258
[SPEAKER_02]: The best fucking homebrew game ever on the PSP and they're actually going to have it finished in June.

1283
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:31,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Full version will be coming out

1284
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,552
[SPEAKER_02]: For free!

1285
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:39,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really sad because the game can, you know, wipe most of those other PSP games out there.

1286
01:11:39,756 --> 01:11:42,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's developed independently and for free.

1287
01:11:42,858 --> 01:11:46,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So check out No Gravity later on this month.

1288
01:11:47,581 --> 01:11:49,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see here.

1289
01:11:49,843 --> 01:11:51,424
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing that's kind of interesting.

1290
01:11:52,324 --> 01:11:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a trademark.

1291
01:11:53,697 --> 01:11:57,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently Capcom made a trademark for Apollo Justice.

1292
01:11:58,099 --> 01:11:59,800
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two rumors regarding this.

1293
01:12:00,161 --> 01:12:07,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people think it's going to be a new rival schools game because apparently I guess the school is named Apollo or something like that.

1294
01:12:07,925 --> 01:12:09,085
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Justice.

1295
01:12:09,306 --> 01:12:09,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice.

1296
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:11,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1297
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:19,171
[SPEAKER_02]: The other theory is that it's a subtitle for the next Phoenix Wright game.

1298
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be either or, huh?

1299
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,270
[SPEAKER_13]: I want more rival schools, please.

1300
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:25,171
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1301
01:12:25,671 --> 01:12:27,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a real quick last-minute story as well.

1302
01:12:27,772 --> 01:12:29,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And, Loki, you'll like this one, I think.

1303
01:12:31,254 --> 01:12:38,618
[SPEAKER_04]: 1UP recently had an interview with the creator of the Mega Man franchise, and they were asking him about sequels and bringing Mega Man to the next-gen platforms.

1304
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:45,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And he basically said, well, don't know if we would be able to recoup the cost of making a game on the next-gen platforms.

1305
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:47,883
[SPEAKER_04]: But they said, come on, just imagine money wasn't an issue.

1306
01:12:47,903 --> 01:12:48,363
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you do?

1307
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said this, quote,

1308
01:12:50,359 --> 01:13:20,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would probably be Mega Man Legends 3 and that's just not or that's not just me a lot of the original team members would also love to make a sequel they talk about it I talk about it sometimes I know they love that series and so do I if I were to say right now I have a tiny tiny tiny dream that I wish I could realize but I don't know if it's possible it would be to do a sequel in the Legends series hell yeah that's a series that they need to take it even further because these other series kind of suck that's a series they need to shoot in the head put it down like an old horse put her down

1309
01:13:20,757 --> 01:13:22,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me more Mega Man X, please.

1310
01:13:23,659 --> 01:13:24,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Legends series.

1311
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I'm a 2D gamer.

1312
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see some type of next-gen Mega Man.

1313
01:13:30,745 --> 01:13:32,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's okay to do a 2D Mega Man.

1314
01:13:32,226 --> 01:13:34,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue Legends series on the Wii.

1315
01:13:34,928 --> 01:13:35,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It's perfect.

1316
01:13:35,989 --> 01:13:38,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's an original PlayStation game.

1317
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:40,772
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely push those kind of graphics on that system.

1318
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:41,713
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not Mega Man.

1319
01:13:42,513 --> 01:13:43,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Who cares?

1320
01:13:43,594 --> 01:13:44,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.

1321
01:13:44,235 --> 01:13:45,175
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Mega Man.

1322
01:13:45,235 --> 01:13:48,398
[SPEAKER_13]: And for me, just to have it go 3D in the first place was like...

1323
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:51,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Ripping out my heart and dancing the Lambada on it.

1324
01:13:52,065 --> 01:13:55,486
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you like the Mega Man X series and the original Mega Man series.

1325
01:13:55,506 --> 01:13:56,226
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a different series.

1326
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:57,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like the Marvel series now.

1327
01:13:57,946 --> 01:14:03,507
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the Marvel 2017 series and the Marvel Universe series and all this other stuff.

1328
01:14:03,547 --> 01:14:04,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it doesn't matter.

1329
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't have to like this series.

1330
01:14:08,409 --> 01:14:09,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this series, so they should make another one.

1331
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:14,750
[SPEAKER_04]: All I could say is, please, anything but those tactical games on the DS.

1332
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:15,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Amen, oh my god.

1333
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:17,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all agree on that.

1334
01:14:17,432 --> 01:14:19,173
[SPEAKER_04]: That series, put it to bed.

1335
01:14:19,314 --> 01:14:24,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Going on the same thing, though, that Loki's saying, that's actually based off of a completely different series.

1336
01:14:25,018 --> 01:14:28,060
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mega Man EXE is what those were.

1337
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or the Battle Network, that's what it's called.

1338
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:31,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it was Rockman EXE.

1339
01:14:31,443 --> 01:14:32,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it to bed.

1340
01:14:32,703 --> 01:14:34,044
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually based off of an anime.

1341
01:14:34,605 --> 01:14:36,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a bullet in its head and be done.

1342
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:37,960
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not the same type of thing.

1343
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,100
[SPEAKER_13]: This is supposed to be Mega Man.

1344
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:43,742
[SPEAKER_13]: This is actually something 100% completely different, just borrowing the name.

1345
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:46,603
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes sense why it's a different type of game.

1346
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:47,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1347
01:14:49,004 --> 01:14:55,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And James Patrick says in chat, Mega Man, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man... Stop this!

1348
01:14:55,746 --> 01:15:02,308
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they don't do a next-gen series that looks like the cover of Mega Man 2 or something like that.

1349
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:04,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1350
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,991
[SPEAKER_13]: The US Capcom art in those days, I mean, did you see the cover for Bionic Commando?

1351
01:15:10,191 --> 01:15:11,172
[SPEAKER_04]: They were pretty awful.

1352
01:15:11,712 --> 01:15:18,514
[SPEAKER_13]: The only cool game that had any, you know, American redone art that was any good was like Metal Gear.

1353
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:23,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the dude looked like, you know, hardcore awesome.

1354
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:24,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, the truck has started to move.

1355
01:15:24,995 --> 01:15:28,496
[SPEAKER_13]: But at least in Bionic Commando you can kill Hitler.

1356
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:30,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and you know what, some of the,

1357
01:15:31,204 --> 01:15:40,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I always think of the box art even back from the Atari 2600 days where they had these elaborate artwork on the box, which of course the game looked nothing like because it was just a bunch of blocks on the screen.

1358
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:42,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, I don't know.

1359
01:15:42,892 --> 01:15:43,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Box art's funny.

1360
01:15:44,493 --> 01:15:47,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it or not.

1361
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:50,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1362
01:15:51,057 --> 01:15:53,338
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight, your final thought.

1363
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:57,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I thought it.

1364
01:15:59,147 --> 01:16:01,148
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is ice cream.

1365
01:16:01,888 --> 01:16:02,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

1366
01:16:03,289 --> 01:16:06,030
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is the screen for the Wii thing.

1367
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:07,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks kind of neat.

1368
01:16:07,071 --> 01:16:08,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a portable screen.

1369
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:09,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, though.

1370
01:16:09,432 --> 01:16:10,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I still wouldn't buy it.

1371
01:16:11,093 --> 01:16:11,393
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1372
01:16:11,553 --> 01:16:16,555

[SPEAKER_09]: Two weeks!

1379
01:16:35,183 --> 01:16:36,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that from Total Recall?

1380
01:16:36,984 --> 01:16:37,604
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

1381
01:16:37,964 --> 01:16:38,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that.

1382
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:39,865
