to websites with listings of past episodes.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,920
Now the conclusion of this weekís episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,080
And weíre back here on Orange Lounge Radio with this our episode number 234 for June

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
the 3rd of 2007.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,760
Weíll be celebrating our 5th anniversary on June 24th of this year if you can believe

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
it.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,160
Thatís how weíve hit so many episodes if you wonder why 234 is a lot.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,760
Anyhow, weíre going to get back into some gaming news.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,800
Donít forget Orange Lounge Radio is in two parts every week.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,440
If you missed some, be sure to go back wherever you got this episode.

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,100
Probably has part A linked as well.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,100
Be sure to grab that.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,000
Loki, why donít you start us off?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,440
Yes, and letís talk a little bit about the hacking cracking scene on the Xbox 360.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,280
Itís kind of interesting, Microsoft a couple of weeks ago took some precautions to ban

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,760
modders from their live service.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,280
Well, in turn, modders have kind of fought back and theyíve created a brand new firmware

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:21,240
upgrade for the Toshiba DVD drives for the TS-H943 that will allow you to play backup

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,400
copies and legally purchase Xbox 360 tiles as well as it defeats all current and some

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,880
future Xbox Live detection attempts.

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,200
Because of that, itís actually allowing people to be able to use Xbox Live without them knowing

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,720
that you have a modded console.

26
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,840
Fight the fight, I guess.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,440
But Microsoft has always been really good about fixing this kind of crap the second

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
it comes out.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
They canít.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Sorry, I shouldnít say crap.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
I mean, it actually is pretty smart.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
But you know what I mean.

33
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,400
They put the ban hammer on this stuff ASAP.

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,920
So how long is this going to last?

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
Well, it depends.

36
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,940
Weíll see how effective this stuff is, but thatís big business for them.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,560
If you look at Sony, theyíve tried and tried with the PSP, but thereís no luck there.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,160
I donít know how much of DVD firmware they can really detect.

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,640
Thereís not really a lot that they can do, I think.

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,400
And if they circumvent the few methods that they have of checking, they might be screwed.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,000
Unless they just do a whole hardware revision or something.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,840
I guess weíll see.

43
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
I donít know.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,280
What do you think, DarkSakura?

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,980
Do you think the hackers and crackers will win in this war, or do you think Microsoft

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,320
will be able to stay on top of them?

47
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,760
Thereís one thing that always works in favor of anyone who decides to system hack, and

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,840
thatís called system becoming obsolete.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,080
Theyíre not going to care if the next oneís going to come out.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,600
Theyíll say, ìWell, screw the old one.î And everyoneís like, ìYay, we win!î Because

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,480
we held out.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,760
So itís kind of like a waiting war, essentially.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
Yeah.

54
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Interesting.

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
True.

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,720
I mean, if you look at the PlayStation 2, they had granted the methods of doing swap

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,900
disks and stuff like that, and the DVD loader and stuff, and now you have the whole running

58
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,400
off of hard drives and stuff, and itís just like, shit, I mean, you donít have to buy

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,240
anything for the PlayStation 2 anymore, you can download everything.

60
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
If people want it bad enough, theyíll find a way.

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,560
I remember the days of the seven swap trick for the first PlayStation.

62
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,200
Well, look at the original Xbox.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,320
I mean, thatís, you know, modified firmware, running stuff off of hard drives, itís rampant.

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,880
All right.

65
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,120
I would say, too, if you donít want to get banned, donít take your console online, because

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
thatís how they fix it.

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
So, I donít know.

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,320
But then again, I guess the whole hack is to have the advantage online.

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,240
But I think thatís fucked up to cheat in online games.

70
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,440
I think those type of people deserve to get banned.

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,600
Well, I donít know if itís doing it for cheating in online games.

72
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,320
I think itís just not having to buy those $60 games is what theyíre doing.

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,920
Or maybe imports.

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Imports might be nice.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,160
Thatís kind of cool.

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,240
Yeah, I think, I donít agree with region control.

77
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,520
I mean, I understand why they do it, you know, so Iím not trying to say, like, oh, it makes

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,480
no sense because, you know, because of licensing and all those other things for the music and

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,720
what have you that they get in the games, but still, I mean, at the end of the day,

80
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,360
it sucks for the consumer, you know what I mean?

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Anyhow, something else that is confusing, nevertheless, for the consumers is that Destructoid

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,600
ran this article earlier this week about the Xbox 360 and the fact that Metal Gear Solid

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,040
4 is confirmed for the Xbox 360.

84
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,480
Now, the article was kind of weird.

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,160
Like, you know, actually, itís funny.

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
The guy who wrote it, Ron Workman, was actually on our year-end special, so Iím kind of wondering

87
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,400
if we should call him up and try to figure out whatís going on, but I donít know if

88
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,080
theyíll talk because, supposedly, Konami sent out a cease and desist.

89
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,880
Now, Destructoid has always been a pretty respectable site in my mind, so I donít think

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
theyíd pull these stories out of their butt, so Iím just kind of wondering, like, it was

91
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,240
very interesting to kind of watch that happen where they had to be very vague about it and

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
then they have this cease and desist coming from Konami, which seems to cement it, if

93
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
that is legit.

94
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,680
I mean, I donít know, could the whole thing be an elaborate prank?

95
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,360
Who knows?

96
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,520
But Computer Game World seems to think so because they ran a counter-story a little

97
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
later on.

98
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Iím sorry, thatís Computer and Video Games.

99
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,520
Sorry, carried it to the wrong side.

100
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,360
Computerandvideogames.com ran a counterpoint a little later on in the week saying, ìKonamiís

101
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,960
confirmed nothing,î is essentially what itís saying.

102
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,640
So saying that, no, Metal Gear Solid 4 has not been confirmed for 360, Konamiís confirmed

103
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
nothing.

104
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,200
But the weird thing about this report is that theyíre basing it on the fact that theyíve

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,820
talked to Konami and Konami refuses to comment on the rumors and that theyíve made no statement

106
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,320
regarding the 360 version.

107
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,240
And in my mind, I kind of go, ìWell, of course Konamiís not going to say anything about

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,240
it.

109
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,400
If they send a cease and desist to one site, itís because theyíre not ready to comment

110
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
on this.

111
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Trust us.

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,700
We know this very well, okay?î So it kind of doesnít mean anything.

113
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,280
To me, that doesnít discount the story at all.

114
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,280
So I donít know.

115
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, speaking of the rumor mill and Konami, wow, there actually were rumors that popped

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,320
up in this monthís issue of EGM stating that Silent Hill 5 was going to be released this

117
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,680
year and handled by Konami USA instead of in Japan.

118
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:41,560
But there was also an interview with the director, Tsubuyama Masashi, who, like I said, was the

119
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,440
chief director on the project.

120
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,000
And he stated that they donít have anything official.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,200
There actually were looking more next-gen console, multi-platform, that he did say to

122
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,600
keep your eyes on the upcoming press conference on July 11th.

123
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,360
And thatís during E3, isnít it?

124
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Yep.

125
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Boom.

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,240
So theyíll probably be revealing Silent Hill 5 at that time.

127
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah.

128
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Interesting.

129
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,440
Try to find my invite.

130
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,400
Well, I donít know.

131
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,480
As long as the series doesnít jump the shark, Iíll be okay.

132
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,280
I think multi-platform is the way to go, though, honestly.

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
More pea-hitty.

134
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,720
Because, you know, Xbox 360 still hasnít really cracked the marketplace in Japan.

135
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,520
I mean, obviously, I think most of us here would like to see it show up on 360.

136
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,040
But over in Japan, you kind of have to put it on PlayStation 3.

137
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,760
The Wii is just probably not going to be able to handle what theyíre going to want to do

138
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,080
graphically with the game.

139
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,520
You should have Silent Hill where you play as, you know, Pyramid Head.

140
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Itís Pyramid Head Adventures with Silent Hill.

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,360
Well, you know, maybeÖ

142
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,280
Watch that crazy cat as he goes and beheads people, the giant metal shark thing.

143
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,400
No, he has to hump all the female monsters.

144
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
Just the female monsters and rapes them and rips their skin off.

145
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
Well, Iíll put a prediction out there.

146
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120
Remember that the Silent Hill is getting an arcade game.

147
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,320
Remember we talked about that a while ago?

148
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,260
There was some arcade expo and they showed a Silent Hill thing there.

149
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,000
Maybe the Wii will get that because you could easily point and shoot with the controller.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So maybe the Wiiís not on.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
Weíre talking Silent Hill Gun Survivor.

152
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,520
Thatís kind of cool, though.

153
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:13,000
Silent Hill Babies coming to ABC Family Saturday mornings.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,640
Underdog Harold says Pyramid Head Mysterious Dungeon would be a fun game.

155
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
That would be great.

156
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,440
With cutesy little music and everything.

157
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,880
Super chibi, Pyramid Head, you know.

158
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,520
Aww, he just beheaded the cat.

159
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,800
That would be fantastic.

160
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,140
Anyways, other interesting stuff.

161
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:45,480
Coming out of the Halo 3 beta, thereís been people actually hacking the beta to reveal

162
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:53,960
all sorts of fun stuff, including they have a brand new chopper that you can ride in the

163
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,840
game.

164
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:05,040
The sword as well as radar jamming items, player operated turrets added to the Wraiths,

165
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,640
actually playing with the Wraith, and different modifications, including ground speed and

166
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,200
gravity and all that sorts of stuff.

167
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,840
And pretty cool, I guess, that you can modify the beta to do that.

168
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,360
I canít believe people have already cracked the game and itís already in beta.

169
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,400
Just imagine when the game actually comes out.

170
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,600
Iím not surprised they did this because people love their Halo almost a little too much,

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
you know what I mean?

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
Yeah.

173
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Well, there you go.

174
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,000
Also, something to mention about Halo 3 is that GamePro is going to be running an article

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,280
talking about that there are, well actually I should say the article is going to be showing

176
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,200
new vehicles, new maps, new weapons, and armor.

177
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
Thatís right, because Halo 3 is going to have armor in it, new armor.

178
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,560
You can create, I shouldnít say create, but you can get armor for your characters, like

179
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,800
new shoulder pads, new helmets, so thatís kind of cool.

180
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,560
Like I look at this one helmet on the particular scans from the site, it looks like an alien

181
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,560
head or something on the helmet, so kind of neat.

182
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,120
It looks like you can almost create your own character from all these custom parts, which

183
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
is good.

184
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,360
Itís kind of taking it a step further because in Halo 2 you can pretty much pick the human

185
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,080
looking guy, the master chief, or the alien looking guy, and then you can choose the colors

186
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
in the emblem, thatís it.

187
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,840
So I think that would be kind of fun if you could take it a step further.

188
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,640
Suddenly Halo has turned Barbie, I donít know.

189
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,480
That just seems to be a common thing.

190
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,380
How long have games had multiple outfits and things that go on in them?

191
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,440
Like Dead Rising, huh?

192
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Dead Rising has some new costumes and themes for Xbox Live, but the costumes are a white

193
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,040
suit, a striped outfit, and an accountant outfit.

194
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,560
Yeah, because I really like to look like an accountant when Iím beating up the undead.

195
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,640
You know, I put on my suit.

196
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
You could.

197
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,120
I keep your tally.

198
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
One beheading!

199
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Two beheadings!

200
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Doesnít that game keep up body kills anyway?

201
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Yeah, it does.

202
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,840
So I guess you can look the part when youíre adding up the corpses.

203
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Anyway.

204
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,040
And you can also dress up like an accountant and slam like a cash register into them.

205
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,160
Itís like, ìKeep the change!î Office space the game.

206
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,640
Do they have a Naked Time costume in that game?

207
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,620
Like you know, Underoos or something?

208
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,200
They have really tight like shorts that you can wear, little kidís shorts.

209
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
I donít know about that.

210
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,240
Thatís a little scary.

211
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,400
You could run around as hard gay, beating up the zombies.

212
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
All right.

213
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Good times.

214
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,840
You know what they really need, though?

215
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,920
They really need like the giant leafs that they have in, oh god, people that sing Yata.

216
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,840
I canít remember the name of the band.

217
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Hapatai.

218
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Hapatai, yeah.

219
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,440
Yeah, they need a giant leaf in that game.

220
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Thatís the only thing thatís missing.

221
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,000
So some interesting stuff happening in New York this week, including some bills being

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,960
passed regarding the ESRB ratings and selling minors M-rated games.

223
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:09,720
Apparently, the law has passed and itís going to make a felony, a class E felony at least,

224
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,360
the least severe felony in the state, if you sell a M-rated game to a minor.

225
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:24,760
So better be careful before you sell those Mortal Kombat and Grand Theft Autos to kids

226
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
out there.

227
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,920
And unfortunately, you know, I guess it has been approved, so hoorah.

228
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
By one part.

229
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,200
Why by one branch or something, right?

230
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Yes.

231
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,360
Itís been approved by the New York Assembly.

232
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,120
This law sucks.

233
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,640
And you know why it sucks?

234
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,520
Because is this same rule being applied to theaters that sell tickets to underage folks

235
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,680
trying to get an R-rated movie?

236
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Then this law is not fair.

237
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,880
Thatís why this law sucks.

238
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,360
Thatís all.

239
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,880
Itís bullshit.

240
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,280
Grand Staney is what it is.

241
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Itís stupid.

242
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Thatís right.

243
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Itís stupid.

244
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
All right.

245
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,640
Weíre going to get into, and actually Iím looking at some comments in the chat room

246
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
here.

247
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,840
Act Def says, ìLaw sucks in general.î Yes, sometimes.

248
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,160
Rama says, ìUnless New York State does a lot of secret shopping and or undercover sting

249
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,280
operations,î which they wonít, ìthis law will not fucking stick at all.î And Gerardimo

250
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,340
says, ìAw, Iím a New York minor, but I only have a Wii, so Iím going to have a far hard

251
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,160
time finding an M game.î

252
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,960
Um, Scarface, Manhunt, Driver, um.

253
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,440
Yeah, but donít buy Driver.

254
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,080
Yeah, unless you want to laugh.

255
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
All right.

256
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Itís the bad AI.

257
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,780
Well, folks, itís about time that we play a little bit of our favorite game to play

258
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,760
here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

259
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:50,400
Itís the Match Game, ladies and gentlemen, and weíre going to open up the phone lines

260
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,040
right now to get a contestant.

261
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,920
We have one contestant from the chat room, and we just need to get an opponent, so if

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Loki, please help us introduce the guests tonight.

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,840
All right, and guest number one, your name?

267

Yes, I donít care where you came from.

268
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,800
Where did you come from, Mielethauk?

269
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Galactica.

270
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Hold on.

271
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,000
Weíve got a contestant call here.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hold on.

273
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Whoís this?

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hi.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Itís Wonder Dog Harold.

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Hi, Wonder Dog Harold.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How are you?

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hey.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Iím fine.

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You win.

282
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You get to play match game tonight, okay?

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Huzzah.

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
All right, all right.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,720
So hold on the line while we introduce the rest of the panelists tonight, okay?

286
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,860
By the way, tonight, speaking of panelists, tonightís edition of the match game here

287
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:10,080
on Orange Lounge Radio, we had to do it tonight dedicated to Mr. Charles Nelson Reilly, who

288
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,860
was from the 70s edition of the match game, which, you know, obviously we are blatantly

289
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,880
ripping off the match game from the 70s.

290
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,760
You see the reruns on game show networks.

291
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
He passed away this week and was one of the main reasons to watch that show.

292
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,040
He was awesome.

293
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,000
So weíre dedicating this edition to him.

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,080
So anyway, so yes, Rice Princess and Mielethauk are here.

295
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,240
They are sacrificing some of their precious time away from watching Battlestar Galactica

296
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,280
episodes back to back to back to be here, because you guys have watched, like, what,

297
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,840
like seven episodes so far this weekend?

298
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,840
How many?

299
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
We have.

300
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Seven episodes?

301
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
We have a lot.

302
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
All right.

303
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
We donít want to take up too much of your precious time.

304
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,240
This is Loki.

305
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Yes.

306
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Iím here.

307
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,120
I know, of course.

308
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
And Dark Sakura.

309
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,280
Roar.

310
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,840
And me, because Iím awesome.

311
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,840
All right.

312
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
So you have five folks tonight.

313
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,320
And Wonder Dog Haroldís on the phone.

314
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
You still there?

315
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Yep.

316
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Good.

317
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,520
And heís going to be playing against Hitstun from the chat room.

318
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,440
Hitstun from the chat room won our drawing during the break.

319
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Okay.

320
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,680
Now, Wonder Dog Harold, do you know how the game works?

321
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Yep.

322
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Okay.

323
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,620
Weíre going to, for those that donít, Iíll just explain it again, weíre going to be

324
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,320
asking some questions.

325
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,800
And weíre going to put in the blanks, but thereís blanks at the end of them.

326
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,580
And you are supposed to come up with what you believe belongs in the blank.

327
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,280
And if you match with anybody in the studio, then you get a point.

328
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
All right.

329
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,840
So we only have three questions tonight, though.

330
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,320
Itís a short game tonight.

331
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,800
Are you ready to play?

332
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Yeah.

333
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
All right.

334
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,160
Are you ready to play, Wonder Dog Harold?

335
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Yep.

336
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
All right.

337
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Here you go.

338
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Here is question number one.

339
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
All right.

340
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,320
Here it is.

341
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,600
Rob just landed himself in big trouble.

342
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,760
When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card

343
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,520
was declined.

344
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,720
Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, ìRob, we turned off your credit

345
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:16,360
card because youíve been buying too much blank.î All our guests are thinking about

346
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
their answers.

347
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,640
Theyíre writing them down.

348
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,280
ìRob, we turned off your credit card because youíve been buying too much blank.î Okay.

349
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,840
All right.

350
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:39,080
Iím waiting for the ñ okay, there we go.

351
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
And all right.

352
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
All right.

353
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,560
You got an answer, Wonder Dog Harold?

354
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
You ready?

355
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Heís still thinking.

356
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
All right.

357
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
While youíre thinking, all right.

358
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Here we go.

359
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,360
Iíll read the question one more time, then weíre going to go to you for an answer.

360
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Here it is.

361
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,840
ìRob just landed himself in big trouble.

362
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,360
When trying to purchase yet another virtual console game with his credit card, the card

363
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,740
was declined.

364
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,520
Upon calling the credit card company, they told him, ìRob, we turned off your credit

365
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,080
card because youíve been buying too much ñî What do you think, Wonder Dog Harold?

366
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Porn.

367
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Porn, says Wonder Dog Harold.

368
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,480
Too much porn.

369
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,640
Hitstun also said porn, so this isnít going to be a very exciting round because if anybody

370
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,120
gets porn, they both get a point.

371
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Thatís all right.

372
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Letís see what our celebrity panel came up with.

373
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,040
Weíll start with Rice Princess.

374
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:30,240
Heís been buying too much ñ ìSilent, occupied Caprica.î Too much silent, occupied Caprica.

375
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
Is that a match?

376
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,560
No, that would not be a match.

377
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Is that a match?

378
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,640
Thatís something from Battlestar Galactica, actually, and we are playing video game match

379
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
game now.

380
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Oh.

381
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
All right.

382
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Miklotov.

383
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,720
Heís been buying too much ñ Because porn is such a totally video game-related

384
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
thing.

385
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,280
Heís been buying too much helo, which is like halo but helo.

386
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Helo.

387
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,800
That would be porn for me.

388
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,240
Another Battlestar Galactica reference.

389
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,280
Thank you very much for that.

390
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Too much helo.

391
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,560
Not a match, though, even if that is the object of Shaneís fantasies we donít need to hear

392
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
about on the show.

393
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
Loki.

394
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,680
Heís been buying too much ñ Actraiser.

395
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Actraiser.

396
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Good guess.

397
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Good guess.

398
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
Loved it so much, he had to buy it five times over.

399
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,200
Yes, to put it in the top five somewhere.

400
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
He bought it for all his friends.

401
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Actually, there you go.

402
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
He filled up one whole page on his ñ Of Actraiser.

403
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Oh, I should do that.

404
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Dark Sakura.

405
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Heís been buying too much.

406
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
Propel.

407
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Propel.

408
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
I havenít used it in ages.

409
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I know.

410
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Propel.

411
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
I actually drank some Propel today.

412
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
Was it good?

413
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Mm-hmm.

414
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
Wow, Rob.

415
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Itís like fitness water.

416
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Itís good.

417
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
All right.

418
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,480
I put ñ Rob, we turned off your credit card because youíve been buying too much candy

419
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,920
because Iím fat.

420
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Candy.

421
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Sorry.

422
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,080
There you go.

423
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
So there it is.

424
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,120
No matches for either contestant that round.

425
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Sorry to say.

426
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Sorry, Wonder Dog Herald.

427
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Aw.

428
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
All right.

429
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,520
That was ñ that was very emotive.

430
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I like that.

431
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
All right, you ready?

432
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,000
You ready to get some points on the second question?

433
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Sure.

434
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
All right.

435
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Here we go.

436
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,760
Thatís what I like, some excited contestants.

437
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,160
Here we go.

438
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,760
Question number two, Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort.

439
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Liar.

440
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,160
But sheís been very ñ itís a game, Jamie.

441
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Play along.

442
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,040
Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but sheís been very impressed with

443
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,600
all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs lately because, you know,

444
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,720
like they have the little coasters that have like Zelda pictures and stuff.

445
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,200
Letís go to Kotaku or something.

446
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Youíll see it.

447
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,880
Sheís been very impressed with all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs

448
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
lately.

449
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,960
She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class when her first

450
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,960
project she brought in was blank.

451
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:53,160
She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class when for her

452
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,320
first project she brought in blank.

453
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,040
All right, ding.

454
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Ding.

455
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Ding.

456
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
All right.

457
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
All right.

458
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:14,320
Iím just waiting for our chat room player, and hopefully our phone player has thought

459
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,720
of an answer too.

460
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,520
The chat room is helping out.

461
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,720
All right.

462
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,080
Wow, one of these answers is an incredibly poor taste.

463
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,720
All right.

464
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,840
I usually are though.

465
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,840
All right, here we go.

466
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Here we go.

467
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Is everybody dinged?

468
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
All right.

469
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Ding.

470
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
All right, here we go.

471
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Here we go.

472
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,480
Jamie is not typically the arts and crafts sort, but sheís been very impressed with

473
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,360
all the video game arts and crafts sheís seen on game blogs lately.

474
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,720
She joined a community college class on knitting but got kicked out of the class for when her

475
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,920
first project she brought inóWonder Dog Harold?

476
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,920
A sweater with hard gay on it.

477
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,840
A sweater with hard gay on it.

478
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Okay, good.

479
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,520
Heís been paying attention to the show because Jamieís been watching hard gay.

480
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,320
Okay, good, good answer, but weíll see if it matches.

481
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,640
Hitstun said a shotgun.

482
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,800
She brought in a shotgun, which might beó

483
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Too soon.

484
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Too soon.

485
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,520
A little bit, but all right, thatís the answer.

486
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,400
All right, Rice Princess, she brought in?

487
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
She brought in a Cylon Occupied Caprica.

488
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:31,140
Unfortunately, Cylon Occupied Caprica is not a match and is still a Battlestar Galactica

489
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,680
reference Rice Princess.

490
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,520
We are playing video gameóCandy is not video games either, so shut up.

491
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,120
Nintendoís cereal was candy.

492
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,480
Thereís a Battlestar game coming out, so take that.

493
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,920
Will it have Cylon Occupied Caprica in it?

494
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Probably.

495
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
All right, here it is.

496
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
For her first project, she brought inóHelo.

497
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:57,240
Guys, you know what your next answers have to be, right?

498
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,800
Possibly.

499
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,120
This by the way will be the last appearance of Rice Princess and Miklótov on our show.

500
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Say goodbye, folks.

501
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Itís been fun.

502
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,640
Itís been a fun five years.

503
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,320
Itís been swell, but the swellingís gone down.

504
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,680
All right, Loki, she brought in?

505
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,800
The corpse of Charles Nelson Riley.

506
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Too soon.

507
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,480
Too soon.

508
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,020
In my refrigerator, hi.

509
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,280
She brought in the corpse of Charles Nelson Riley to her knitting class?

510
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,580
Thatís horrible.

511
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,320
She needed a reference, a lifelike reference of knitting his corpse.

512
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,000
Dark Sakura, she brought in?

513
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
A Glock 37.

514
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
A Glock 37?

515
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Too soon.

516
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Itís a gun.

517
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Donít you watch the news?

518
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
No.

519
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,880
You are not supposed to make guns at college jokes.

520
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Itís not cool.

521
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,640
If you donít make fun of it, how will you ever recover?

522
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
All right, true.

523
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,000
Hey, itís a half of a match, though.

524
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,640
Is a Glock 37 a shotgun?

525
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
I donít think so.

526
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
No, but itís a firearm, so it gets to have a point.

527
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,920
No, porn and helo are not a match, neither is shotgun and whatever Jamie said.

528
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
All right.

529
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,320
But itís a powerful gun.

530
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,200
GS 191 says, does this mean I can call Loki a nappy-headed hoe, then?

531
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,080
I donít know, maybe.

532
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
He kind of is.

533
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
My hair is not nappy.

534
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Anyway.

535
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Dude, the chat room calls for half a point.

536
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
All right.

537
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,080
No, thatís nice for the chat room, too bad itís not their game.

538
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,360
All right, anyway, I said that she brought in, because it was a knitting class, she brought

539
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,920
in a quilt with Pyramid Head raping a corpse.

540
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,960
All right.

541
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
And it actually wasÖ

542
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,040
Of course, I know you donít make quilts in knitting class.

543
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
You donít knit a quilt.

544
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,680
Thatís why they kicked her out, stupid.

545
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,960
Well, my other answer was going to be bloody steel needles.

546
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,760
Actually, Pyramid Head was raping Charles Nelson Rileyís corpse, so go figure.

547
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,980
With a shotgun.

548
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,520
That would not be attractive.

549
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,080
That would be attractive, Rob.

550
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,160
So Wonder Dog Harold, Iím very sorry, you still have a zero.

551
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
Ow!

552
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Shit!

553
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,960
That hurt!

554
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,560
And Dark Soccer just injured herself.

555
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,560
So at least you get that.

556
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,480
No, I injured my laptop and indirectly injured myself.

557
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
All right.

558
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,720
Wonder Dog Harold, are you going to get a point on this last one?

559
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
At least one.

560
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
All right, at least one.

561
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,760
Here we go.

562
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,000
Here it is, the last question, folks.

563
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,880
Piggy was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fauna Mae.

564
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,680
He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

565
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,560
He said to himself, ìThatís it.

566
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:43,960
Next year Iím coming dressed as blank.î

567
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,000
He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

568
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,720
He said to himself, ìThatís it.

569
00:25:48,720 --> 00:26:06,840
Next year Iím coming dressed as blank.î

570
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,960
No extra fur, youíre too late, you canít play now.

571
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
I want to ding.

572
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
I want to do a bonus point.

573
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,400
You canít do a bonus point.

574
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,040
Fine, extra fur wants to be a bonus point.

575
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Fine.

576
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
All right, yeah, I think we got an answer.

577
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,200
All right, there we go.

578
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,160
All right, thereís the end of the music.

579
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,600
All right, here we go.

580
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,920
Loki was very impressed with all the cosplay he saw at Fauna Mae.

581
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,200
He was shocked, though, at one thing that was missing.

582
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,740
He said to himself, ìThatís it.

583
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,600
Next year Iím coming dressed asî.

584
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Wonder Dog Harold?

585
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Helo?

586
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Helo!

587
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,680
Okay, all right, so I see the tactic youíre taking here.

588
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,560
All right, well, letís see if itís a match.

589
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Rice Princess.

590
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,120
Wait, I have the microphone, and whoís the other guy who needs to take it?

591
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Oh, Iím sorry.

592
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Oh, yeah, thatís right.

593
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
Hitstun, sorry.

594
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,160
Hitstun said, ìIím coming dressed as missworld96nude.î

595
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Good answer, good answer.

596
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
All right, letís see.

597
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Sure.

598
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
So we have Helo and missworld96nude.

599
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Letís start.

600
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,800
Rice Princess was number one, though, so.

601
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
I grabbed the microphone.

602
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,440
Fine, Mieglotov, what was your answer?

603
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,000
My answer, a silent, occupied Caprica.

604
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,920
Are you doing this just to screw with our?

605
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,920
No, we had already planned that out, so.

606
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,920
Rice Princess, what did you say?

607
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,720
Next year Iím coming dressed as?

608
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Answer

609
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Gata.

610
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Gata?

611
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Gata.

612
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,560
Heís in the CIC in Battlestar.

613
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,800
Heís Lieutenant Gata.

614
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,040
You guys totally screwed Wonder Dog Harold out of a point.

615
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,800
I had already planned mine, so.

616
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
Wonder Dog Harold, would you care to yell at our celebrities?

617
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
No.

618
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,640
Somebody could still say Helo.

619
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
All right, here we go.

620
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Thereís three of you guys left.

621
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
All right, yeah, thatís true.

622
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
Somebody could still say Helo.

623
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,320
Loki, he decided to come dressed as?

624
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,480
I was just going to say it myself.

625
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,740
I donít cosplay.

626
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,640
Fuck this shit.

627
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,040
I donít cosplay.

628
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
Fuck this shit.

629
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Itís not a match.

630
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Iím sorry to say.

631
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Dark Sakura, heís going to come dressed as?

632
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Hadouge.

633
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,920
Hadouge.

634
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,160
Also not a match.

635
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,040
And I said, next year Iím coming dressed as?

636
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Helo, obvious.

637
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Tingle.

638
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,000
Helo, heís coming dressed as Tingle.

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,960
For finally the OLR fans could be happy.

640
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
And fine.

641
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,520
Extrovert wants a bonus point.

642
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,040
Letís see if thereís a match.

643
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,800
You could decide the game right here.

644
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,560
Iím going to come dressed as?

645
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,160
I was going to say Hot Dog from, oh, from Battlestar Galactica.

646
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:46,960
I fucking hate this show.

647
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:55,080
So there it is, unfortunately nobody won, hitstun got zero, and Wonder Dog Harold, Iím

648
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,920
sorry to say you got zero as well.

649
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,840
So you have to give us money.

650
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,000
Can I say something?

651
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes.

652
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,360
My dogís been lost for two days and they found her.

653
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
In one piece?

654
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
Yes.

655
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Good.

656
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,640
Iím glad the bitch is okay.

657
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,360
I was really depressed for two days.

658
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
Alright.

659
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,280
Um, Wonder Dog Harold, as a consolation prize, Iíll let you plug any website or something

660
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,880
you want to give a plug to here on air.

661
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,480
Um, nope.

662
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,360
Youíre a man of many words, Wonder Dog Harold, I appreciate it.

663
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
Thank you for calling in and being a contestant tonight.

664
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Alrighty.

665
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
Alright, take care.

666
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Bye-bye.

667
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Bye.

668
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
Bye.

669
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,360
That was great.

670
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
We need to have you on the show more often.

671
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,600
I think Wonder Dog Harold said like ten words, itís like when Megalodon gets on the show,

672
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
he says ten words the entire show.

673
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,920
You need to be in studio and weíll see if you speak more.

674
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Alright.

675
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,600
Alright, so we have zero, zero, everybody is a loser.

676
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,000
Hitstun says the chat failed me, theyíre fired.

677
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,920
Hitstun says, you know, I can challenge Wonder Dog Harold at Tetris DS or Mario Kart or something.

678
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,440
I know the chat room was screaming Tingle, it would have been a point.

679
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,720
Alright, thatís it for Match Game.

680
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,400
And at this point I will now kick out all of the guests because they obviously need

681
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
to go watch Battlestar Galactica.

682
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,800
Do you want some ice cream though?

683
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
I want ice cream.

684
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Are you guys going to get ice cream?

685
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Get milkshakes.

686
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
No.

687
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
I donít want to get ice cream.

688
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
You guys get ice cream.

689
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
You can get me a milkshake.

690
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,200
Or we can go get ice cream and not bring any back.

691
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,740
How about this, Iíll let, okay, weíll let you guys take over the afterbirth while we

692
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
go get ice cream.

693
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,880
Can we make our own cage match?

694
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Yeah, can you?

695
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
No, I donít think so.

696
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Damn it.

697
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
I put in an awesome song.

698
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Well, think about it.

699
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Alright.

700
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Think about it and come get back to me.

701
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Weíll get back to you.

702
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
Alright.

703
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,440
Alright, I know, thereís going to be a theme from Battlestar Galactica.

704
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,600
You can let me do it and itíll all be Doctor Who.

705
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,680
Alright, well, tonightís Match Game was a colossal failure.

706
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,800
Doctor Who is cooler than Battlestar Galactica.

707
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,480
I donít know, I donít know about that.

708
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
It is a pretty good show.

709
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Donít egg them on.

710
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
Yeah, seriously.

711
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Donít encourage them.

712
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Alright, letís talk about porn.

713
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Yay!

714
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,160
Can I get a yay for porn?

715
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Yay!

716
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Yay!

717
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,520
Well, actually this isnít real porn, but itís Leisure Suit Larry, which is kind of

718
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,600
like, you know, it was kind of like the Cinemax of gaming back in the day.

719
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,680
It was like, you know, you might see a titty if you freeze frame once in a while.

720
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,040
Well, Leisure Suit Larry is coming to mobile platforms.

721
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,180
Thatís right.

722
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,080
You can see some pixelated boobies.

723
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,320
God For Sale, which was the seventh game in the Leisure Suit Larry series, is coming to

724
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
cell phones.

725
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
Go figure.

726
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,160
Itís coming from Vivendi Games Mobile, and itís coming out in September.

727
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,840
But if youíre in Europe, youíre getting it first, you get it in June.

728
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,280
Quote from this one, President of Vivendi Games Mobile, Paul Maglione, quote, ìLarry

729
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,560
fans worldwide have a strong allegiance to the classic Leisure Suit Larry adventure game

730
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
format.

731
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,040
We are delighted to be doing just that with the mobile version.

732
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,300
Weíve kept the iconic Larry humor and attitude intact while adapting the graphics, language

733
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:04,040
and controls for a mass market global audience.î So there you go, some pixelated JavaScript

734
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,840
titty coming to a cell phone near you.

735
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
Yay.

736
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,720
And if you want your titties to be more realistic, then Dead or Alive the movie is coming out

737
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:24,740
June 15th, and well, itís going to be about as deep as Mortal Kombat the movie, probably

738
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:32,800
less deep, but it will be coming out to theaters, and there will be lots of chicks fighting,

739
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,360
and I know thereís one scene with a chick fighting topless, but of course, you know,

740
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
this isó

741
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,680
Is this because youíve already watched the whole movie on Google video when it was out

742
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
a while ago?

743
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,720
No, but I downloaded the PSP version of it off of Google video.

744
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,360
Thatís good.

745
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:59,080
Well, speaking of things that have no depth, SingStar 90s isóoh, my God, why are people

746
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
still playingó

747
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,200
You know what, the SingStar games donít look that bad.

748
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I actuallyó

749
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Oh, I played it at E3.

750
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah.

751
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,520
And I had to do Motorhead with some guy.

752
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,920
Iím more excitedóheaven forbid Iím saying Iím excited about a PlayStation 3 game, but

753
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,000
I think SingStar will be better on the PlayStation 3.

754
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,360
We can downloadólike, so that way you donít have all these frickiní CD expansion packs,

755
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
right?

756
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,800
Well, thank you for reading my story for me.

757
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,880
Oh, no, I havenít said anything about what it is.

758
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,680
Well, what I was going to say is that there actually is some speculation that for the

759
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:37,120
PS3 SingStar, there would be some more data for download via the download service, but

760
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:45,000
actually SingStar 90s isóactually was announced for New Zealand stores for August 3rd, soó

761
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah.

762
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What kind of songs are in this game?

763
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Is there a song list?

764
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Thereís a gallery.

765
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,760
Oh, hereís a song list.

766
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,360
Never Ever, All Saints, Barbie Girl, Love Shack, One Week, Achy Breaky Heart, with a

767
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,880
big fat typo on the page.

768
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
This game already fails.

769
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Unbelievable.

770
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,320
Hey, that was a good song.

771
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,800
Here Comes the Hot Stepper.

772
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,640
It has Stay on it.

773
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Really?

774
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
By Shakespeareís Sister?

775
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
No, Lisa Loeb.

776
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Oh, dammit.

777
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,800
You Canít Touch This, Bitch, which I donít like that song at all.

778
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,080
Moving On Up, Torn, Step byóoh, New Kids on the Block is on it.

779
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
Thatís cool.

780
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
This game might be interesting.

781
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,320
Dude, Where the Wild Roses Go.

782
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,560
I fucking love that song.

783
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,920
Is that the Nick Cave song?

784
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
And Kylie.

785
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Yes.

786
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Wow, thatís kind of cool.

787
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
It has Poison on it.

788
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Wannabe.

789
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,640
I wonder if that game will come out in the US with that.

790
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Dude, Radiohead!

791
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Thatís kind of neat.

792
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
R.E.M.

793
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,200
It has Savage Garden, Kiss from a Rose, Baby Got Back.

794
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,800
Thatís funny.

795
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
Um, yeah, Zombies on it.

796
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Zombies, Zombies.

797
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Dude, heís got the cure.

798
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Iím getting this game.

799
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Zombies, Zombies, Zombies.

800
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
Okay, good.

801
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,240
Uh, letís see, uh, Black Boy in our chatroom says, Sing Star needs more Bjork.

802
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
I agree.

803
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:04,640
Iím a tree that grows hollow, one for it at your back.

804
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,040
See, I do a great impression, donít I?

805
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,880
What was Margaret Cho's impersonation?

806
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,560
Iím sorry that I tried to eat your head.

807
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,240
By the way, thereís this YouTube somewhere of, and I know we talked about it on the show

808
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,640
before, but itís worth bringing up again, itís that funny, where somebody took, because

809
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,720
you know Bjork one time beat the crap out of some reporter in an airport in Thailand?

810
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,520
Well somebody put Street Fighter graphics and music over it and itís really funny,

811
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
itís on YouTube somewhere.

812
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,400
Iím sure one of the chatters will dig it up somewhere.

813
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,720
So there it goes.

814
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,520
Something else you can find on the internet is a role in a movie!

815
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,160
Amazing!

816
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,960
And uh, but I donít know if you really want to be in this movie, because itís an UE Bowl

817
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,960
movie.

818
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,080
Uh, heís actually auctioning off a role on eBay for a role in Far Cry.

819
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:06,040
The bidding started at 2,498 Euros, which would translate to about $3,360 US.

820
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,760
And the winner would get five days on the set of the movie, and uh, unfortunately though,

821
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,280
they would have to cover the flight and the hotel.

822
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,800
So go figure that nobody bid on it!

823
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Interesting.

824
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,440
If I had the money, Iíd do it.

825
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Why?

826
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
Because.

827
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,040
Because youíre like, ìHey, look at that!

828
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,240
I was in that crappy movie!î Then I could say, ìI was in the movie and it fucking sucked!î

829
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,480
The official eBay page is all in German, so itís kind of hard for me to make out, but

830
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
it didnít sell.

831
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,920
It doesnít look like it sold.

832
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,280
Yeah, he sucks.

833
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,080
Thank you, Tigerclaw, for finding the Bjork Street Fighter video.

834
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,280
Awesome.

835
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,920
Alright, well, uh, stories about UE Bowl make us very angry, so you know what that means,

836
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
boys and girls?

837
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:09,880
Itís time for the FUs of the Week.

838
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,720
Dark Sakura, start us off.

839
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,540
What makes me angry?

840
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:21,000
What makes me angry is the check engine light coming on on my car, um, because, well, we

841
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,720
checked the, um, all the emissions, everything was clean, there was no problem with any of

842
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,000
that, so I think it just needs to spark plugs, but other than that, it was just really aggravating.

843
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,520
Oh, and one other thing, FU to Office Drama.

844
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,920
And new leather smell on my massage table.

845
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,520
Loki, any FUs of the Week?

846
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:50,760
Uh, yeah, FU to, um, the key flash component to VGA thing Iíve got, because it doesnít

847
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:57,040
work like it should, because, you know, my picture shouldnít be flashing on and off

848
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,960
on the screen, that would probably mean itís not working, so, fuck them, and fuck you for

849
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,560
wasting $50 of my money.

850
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Um, my FU of the Week goes to the fact that Iím flying out to the East Coast in 48 hours,

851
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,320
and I havenít done any packing yet, so FU to myself for not packing yet.

852
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,200
Maybe after tonightís show, weíll see.

853
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,200
All right, letís get back into some gaming news.

854
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,720
Well, back to rumors and speculation.

855
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:36,720
There actually was a little bit from Famitsu announcing that several Metal Gear Solid 20th

856
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,800
Anniversary titles were supposed to be out, so theyíve listed for the 26th of July Metal

857
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:53,440
Gear Solid Collection for PlayStation, PS2, and PSP, also Metal Gear Solid 3 on PS2, Metal

858
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,200
Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear Solid 2, did I just say that?

859
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,800
They listed it twice.

860
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,480
There also is Metal Gear Solid for PlayStation and Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Metal Gear

861
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,280
Solid Portable Ops for PSP re-releases, I guess.

862
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,080
Like, yay, you can just go to your used video game store and get them.

863
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,960
Are they going to re-do graphics or anything?

864
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,520
It doesnít say anything.

865
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Lame.

866
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,880
So itís just basically repackaged, re-priced.

867
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
It doesnít say anything.

868
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Whoopee!

869
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,800
Well, I mean, given anything released in Japan, um, thereís always the possibility of having

870
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,120
limited edition stuff that comes with, you know, like forks and plates and things, and

871
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,400
donít laugh because Iíve bought a video game that came with a fork and a plate and

872
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,120
a clock and a pillowcase.

873
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
What happened to the dish and the spoon?

874
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Did they run away together?

875
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,440
It had a dish and a spoon with it.

876
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,720
It was that Cardcaptor Soccer game that came out on Dreamcast.

877
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,400
So I wouldnít discount the fact that, you know, something else might come out with it

878
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,520
to make it all kind of, ooh, special, but it doesnít say anything yet.

879
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,400
So Iím not going to put any stock into it until I get something official.

880
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,360
Well, something coming soon, or at least a rumor to be coming soon.

881
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,040
Tony Erickson, of course, the rumorís been going around saying that thereís going to

882
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,640
be a PSP phone coming soon.

883
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,920
Well, apparently thereís been a patent thatís been spotted on the US patent website, and

884
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,280
thereís some pretty hard evidence there showing kind of a prototype of something that looks

885
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,360
like a very thick phone thatís going to have a rotatable screen, almost looks like a PSP,

886
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,800
just a little bit thicker.

887
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,720
Very interesting, though, kind of the same stuff I think we saw before when they were

888
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,440
showing off like the mobile Nintendo games and stuff, you know, where you can pause the

889
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,960
game when you get a call and that kind of stuff.

890
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,960
I donít know.

891
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:53,400
Obviously no firm plans have been made yet, but something thatís coming soon, Iím guessing.

892
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,040
This thing looks stupid.

893
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,360
It makes me think of the great phone taco.

894
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
The N-Gage?

895
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
The N-Gage.

896
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
I had a phone taco.

897
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,360
I donít getó

898
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,360
What?

899
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
You had an N-Gage?

900
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
I told you I had one.

901
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
It was free.

902
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
Loser.

903
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,720
It was free, and we gave it away.

904
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Cheap loser.

905
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,920
Oh, okay, so thatís what it would be.

906
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,920
That makes more sense.

907
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,100
It looks like what would happen is youíd actuallyóyouíd have your kind of directional

908
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:26,640
button and stuff like youíd normally have on a phone, and then that whole screen would

909
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,640
flip around and then you would have kind of like a PSP looking thing.

910
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
Itís neat.

911
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,280
I donít know if that would work very well.

912
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,720
It looks unwieldy and kind of crappy like the Blackberries do.

913
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,000
I donít know.

914
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,640
Just you know, PSPs arenít that expensive.

915
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,280
Just stick with the PSP.

916
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,680
Turn the PSP into a phone.

917
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,680
There you go.

918
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,600
How about get a phone, get a PSP.

919
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,680
I would rather have a phone that I can do two things on.

920
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Number one, call people.

921
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Number two, text message.

922
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Thatís frickiní it.

923
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,200
Thatís why I paid 30 bucks for my phone, and I have a nice phone, but if I want to

924
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,320
play a video game, then Iíll just get something thatís dedicated to video games.

925
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,880
I can take pictures with my phone, which is fine because I have a camera and all, but

926
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,200
sometimes you can take pictures with your camera phone when people donít know it.

927
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,040
Okay, that would be a number three.

928
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
That would be a number three.

929
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,200
But seriously, this iPhone crap and this PSP phone crap, why donít you just get a PSP

930
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,680
or get an iPod?

931
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,680
How hard is it?

932
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,920
PSPs are pretty large too.

933
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I wouldnít really want to use it as a phone.

934
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,240
Now if somebody gave me an iPhone, I wouldnít disagree, or if I got a big fat discount on

935
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,920
one, I wouldnít disagree, but it was not something that I think is worth 600 bucks

936
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,000
for, and neither would this PSP phone thing be.

937
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,160
I have a phone that works, and I have one PSP, and I have a bunch of DSís.

938
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,360
You could probably just play whatever.

939
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,680
You could probably buy a pretty nice phone for $600, not Apple brand.

940
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,240
Iíd like to think my phone was pretty nice.

941
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,920
It was only 200 bucks a year ago.

942
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,640
I could buy a full GPS system with built-in headphones to talk to anybody in the world

943
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,400
for enough money, but why would I want to do that?

944
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,060
I have my phone.

945
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,400
I think that all of this is ridiculous.

946
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,820
Itís just because people are tech addicts and need to have something that does more

947
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,440
than it needs to do.

948
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,400
All right, well on that PSP, you could play this.

949
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,140
Also being reported in Famitsu is that a new version of Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins is

950
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,560
coming out for the PSP.

951
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Itís coming out in Japan, and theyíre redoing it.

952
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,760
Itís going to be making the game a little closer to its arcade roots.

953
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,140
The number of continues is going to be limited, and players will be forced to complete the

954
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,000
game twice before seeing the ending.

955
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,120
In other words, theyíve made this game even harder than it was before.

956
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,120
Wow.

957
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,720
It was pretty hard before.

958
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
So there you have it.

959
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,440
Ghosts and Goblins, it better be hard.

960
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,600
So August 2nd is the day the game is coming out.

961
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,040
No import plans announced yet for the game to come out in North America, but we can all

962
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,920
hold our breath, and maybe weíll get it.

963
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,960
But Iím sure itíll be dumbed down and made easy, just like most of the games they bring

964
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,960
over from Japan.

965
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,960
Who knows?

966
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,960
Maybe weíll die first.

967
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
All right.

968
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,960
One more story, then weíre going to get to our Skype line.

969
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,260
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or you can call us, Orange Lounge Radio is

970
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,260
our user name.

971
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,260
Iím sorry, two more stories.

972
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,280
Orange Lounge Radio is our user name on Skype.

973
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,280
Two more stories.

974
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,280
My bad.

975
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:39,200
Well, at any rate, the ñ you remember the whole Second Life exploitation that was going

976
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
on?

977
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,080
Didnít we cover that last week?

978
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
Did it involve cock-throwing?

979
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
No.

980
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:54,160
Well, at any rate, a Pennsylvania attorney is taking Linden Labs to court because theyíre

981
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,640
ñ sheís saying that they illegally took away the items that were supposed to have

982
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,400
been acquired during ñ let me see the quote ñ allegedly acquired using an exploit by

983
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,920
an SL user.

984
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:17,120
He was banned, lost everything, and the court actually is denying the request to dismiss

985
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,120
the case.

986
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,840
Theyíve denied it twice.

987
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,480
Thereís actually a big quote on here that says, ìThe case will still need to play out

988
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,760
and only concerns the sum of $8,000.00, however, it appears that greater scrutiny and enforcement

989
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,480
of commerce within Second Life and other virtual worlds is possible and may be necessary.

990
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,640
The commerce, largely characterized by pyramid schemes, faulty valuations, and unreal exchange

991
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,520
rates could be subject to real-world law.î So ñ

992
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,600
Thatís what he made, Third Life.

993
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,920
Yeah, for people who donít want to ñ

994
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,880
Second Life is too real for you.

995
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,320
Go to Third Life.

996
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,000
So if someone steals all my equipment in World of Warcraft, I can sue them over it?

997
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,760
Thatíll be kind of cool, I guess.

998
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Maybe.

999
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,760
Interesting.

1000
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:07,400
Iím suing you for vandalizing my building by throwing cocks at it.

1001
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
Damn you.

1002
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,700
Damn you to hell.

1003
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,440
If someone threw cocks at me, Iíd sue them.

1004
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,840
Iím thinking I should sue these guys.

1005
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,200
Theyíre masters.

1006
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,920
They never seem to fail me when it comes to thinking up video game ideas.

1007
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,600
Theyíre creating Dirty Dancing, the video game.

1008
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,280
Yes, thatís right, Dirty Dancing.

1009
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:38,560
Such a wonderful game, and I donít know what the hell they could be doing with this.

1010
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:49,520
Great idea if they pull it off, but I really wish they put this baby in the corner.

1011
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,260
But apparently it says, ìWorking alongside a team at Kellermanís Resort, play through

1012
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:59,240
a fantastic variety of fun mini-games, earned camp dollars to purchase Dirty Dancing memorabilia,

1013
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,280
cabin furnishings, and all-important dance lessons with Johnny and Penny.

1014
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,640
How will you fare in the end of the season dance contest?î

1015
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,160
Didnít they already try bringing back the Dirty Dancing franchise with that Havana Nights

1016
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,680
movie or whatever it was that tanked?

1017
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,480
I donít know if it tanked, but yeah.

1018
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,200
I agree with Wonder Dog Harold.

1019
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Wonder Dog Harold says, ìI want Mannequin, the video game.î Hell yeah.

1020
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,280
With that one guy with the glasses, what the hell was his name?

1021
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,400
The really flamey guy in the movie that was like the assistóoh, God, I know somebodyís

1022
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
going to yell it in chat.

1023
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,400
I know it.

1024
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,240
Thatís what I want to see, Mannequin, the video game.

1025
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,240
Thatís great.

1026
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,240
All right.

1027
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,120
Would you play Dirty Dancing, the video game?

1028
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,120
Maybe this is what happened to X-Tango.

1029
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,120
I donít know.

1030
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,120
I want X-Tango.

1031
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,120
Would you play Dirty Dancing, the game, Darzagra?

1032
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,120
No.

1033
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,120
All right.

1034
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
It was Meshach Taylor.

1035
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,320
Yeah, that was theóHollywood was his name.

1036
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
Thank you.

1037
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,240
Thank God his name was Hollywood.

1038
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,240
Thank you, Black Boy.

1039
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,240
All right.

1040
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,680
Letís get to the Skype line, shall we?

1041
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,800
If youíd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge

1042
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Radio.

1043
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,440
The phones are now open for business, so give us a call.

1044
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,560
Weíll just sit here and wait.

1045
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Okay, great.

1046
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
We got some calls coming in already.

1047
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,440
Thereís a little bit of a delay, so it takes a minute.

1048
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,440
Hi.

1049
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
Youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

1050
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,440
Whoís this?

1051
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
Yeah, you already know.

1052
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Itís Legend of Zaku.

1053
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,440
Hey, Zaku.

1054
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
How you doing?

1055
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,920
What do you think aboutónow, I know youíre into cell phone games.

1056
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,240
What do you think about Leisure Suit Larry on the mobile phones?

1057
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:44,080
I havenít seen it yet, but I would assume it has to be text and graphics-based, where

1058
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:52,560
you just have toóbasically, text and images, itís basically the whole premise of cell

1059
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,520
phone games just to garner the casual gamerís attention, but yeah, if it works out, thatís

1060
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,520
great.

1061
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,520
Maybe some pixelated boobies.

1062
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,520
Who knows?

1063
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,520
Anywayó

1064
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,520
Perhaps.

1065
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,520
What did you call in about tonight, Zaku?

1066
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:11,480
You know, just random stuff, like the fact thatóI forgot what I was going to sayóyeah,

1067
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:19,120
itís likeóI donít know, I was just getting about Tekken 6 and the fact that all the rumors

1068
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:26,240
about it going to the 360, just in general of how the state of affairs is with trying

1069
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:33,080
to make games, that weíre starting to lose exclusives because everythingís going multi-platform.

1070
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,520
Let me ask Dark Soccer a little bit about this, because youíre right.

1071
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,840
We didnít talk about Tekken 6 tonight at all.

1072
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,320
It just kind of missed our show role, but there was a story about Tekken 6 earlier this

1073
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,900
week, just some screenshots coming out, and now the rumor is saying that it will be on

1074
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,280
PlayStation 3, but coming to the 360 a little bit later, so I know youíre a big Tekken

1075
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,280
fan, girl.

1076
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,280
What is it, Tek?

1077
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,280
Dark Soccer, what do you think?

1078
00:49:52,280 --> 00:50:00,320
Iíd still just stick with it on PS3 myself, just because I think itíll look a little

1079
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,760
bit better, play a little bit better, and that Namco has just been all about Sony, soó

1080
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:10,080
Yeah, thatís what I was thinking, but then you also have Ace Combat 6, which is 360.

1081
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:16,400
Itís a timed exclusive, which the PS3 version will come afterwards, so itís kind of like

1082
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
the universe.

1083
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,080
It probably also helps that Tekken 6 arcade hardware is built off the PlayStation 3, so

1084
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,680
itís probably pretty simple to port it over to the PlayStation 3.

1085
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,360
It might take a little longer for Xbox 360, but theyíre not dumb.

1086
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,280
Obviously theyíre going to put it over on the 360 at some point.

1087
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:41,240
And if you looked at the recent mini E3 lineup list that they had, apparently, I donít know,

1088
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:47,040
itís just like all I see is very few exclusive PS3 games from other companies.

1089
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,600
I mean, obviously Sony is the only one making their own PS3 games.

1090
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,600
Well, who knows, though.

1091
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,360
Sony may have some surprises in store.

1092
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,600
You canít reallyóI mean, usually the announcements about what weíre going to see at E3 is shit

1093
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,040
we already know about that was delayed from last year, so a lot of itís going to be surprises,

1094
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,080
but Iím assuming if E3 operates any similar way this year than it did last year, which

1095
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,080
Iím assuming will be the same thing.

1096
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,240
Chances are itís going to be much smaller, much more closed.

1097
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,240
Well, besides that, I mean, the wayó

1098
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,240
Weíre probably going to get like third-hand information.

1099
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,320
But Iím saying the way the news works, you know?

1100
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,320
Right.

1101
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
I think that will still kind of pretty much be the same thing.

1102
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,320
The big boys will get in.

1103
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,320
Weíll have to feed off of them eventually.

1104
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,120
Yeah, well, you know.

1105
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,160
At some point, the rest of the internet will get fed up with it, but weíll just wait.

1106
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,160
All right.

1107
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,680
Well, anyway, Zach, anything else on your mind before we take some other calls?

1108
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,560
Thatís about it.

1109
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,200
We New Yorkers have 2DX Happy Sky in the arcades.

1110
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Oh, where at?

1111
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,880
The same place where we find the only pop music machine in the city, Peter Pan Games

1112
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,880
in Queens.

1113
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,640
I might have to look that place up while Iím out there.

1114
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,640
Weíll see.

1115
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
All right.

1116
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
All right.

1117
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
Later, Zaku.

1118
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,640
Bye.

1119
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,640
All right.

1120
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,160
If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1121
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,320

1122
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,880

Hey, hey, hey.

1126
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,880
Hi, Emma.

1127
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,880
Hey, Rama.

1128
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
How you doing?

1129
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,880
Hi.

1130
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,880
How are you doing?

1131
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,880
Hi, everyone.

1132
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,880
How did you enjoy your trip out to California?

1133
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,880
Oh, it was fucking awesome.

1134
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,880
I loved it.

1135
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,880
Seriously.

1136
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,880
Yeah.

1137
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
Weíre having a hard time hearing you, Rama.

1138
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,880
Get a little closer to your microphone.

1139
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,880
I said I had fun.

1140
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,880
I enjoyed it very much.

1141
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,880
Good deal.

1142
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,880
I wanted to somehow make my way out there for a weekend just to have fun.

1143
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,880
Weíre a fun bunch here.

1144
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,880
Well, what did you want to call in and talk about tonight?

1145
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,080
Well, one of the things anybodyís been bitching on me about are pictures, so Iím posting a

1146
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,800
link in the chat room right now for the pictures.

1147
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,400
Oh, do you have pictures of the panel and stuff?

1148
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,280
I have a few pictures of the panel.

1149
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,280
Nice.

1150
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,280
Itís djronemas.mypockybox.com.

1151
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280

1152
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,280
Yeah.

1153
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,280
Thatís cute.

1154
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,280

1155
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
Forward slash gallery.

1156
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
Forward slash Fonomay2007.

1157
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
Awesome.

1158
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:54,480
Iím looking at some of the pictures right now.

1159
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,120
You got tons and tons of cosplayers.

1160
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,880
What was some of your favorite cosplay you saw?

1161
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,440
I have to be biased, but I was really going for the Ron and the One-Half cosplays because

1162
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,560
thereís been a while where not many people are cosplaying that series, but now lately

1163
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,200
this is making one hell of a comeback.

1164
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,520
The series is kind of old though, right?

1165
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,720
Yeah, but great series like that never old.

1166
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:23,520
Now, one of the favorite pieces of cosplay I saw was actually Jonas, whoís been on OLR

1167
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,520
before.

1168
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,520
Heís been on this program before.

1169
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,360
He cosplayed as a Wii remote.

1170
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,360
And he was actuallyó

1171
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,360
Yeah, that was him.

1172
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,360
You believe it?

1173
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
That was awesome.

1174
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,360
Yeah.

1175
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,560
He was actually going to come to the show tonight, but I donít think he got the address

1176
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,400
in time of where weíre at now because weíve been in like four different studios.

1177
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,360
He hasnít been on the show in a long time, but yeah, that was one of my favorite pieces

1178
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,360
of cosplay.

1179
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,480
Oh my God, thereís the Dolphy pictures.

1180
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,040
Iím trying to findóoh, thereís the OLR panel.

1181
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
Here we are.

1182
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,800
Oh, Sky, who are you choking in this picture?

1183
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Which one?

1184
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,800
Let me look.

1185
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,800
Number 124.

1186
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
I just posted it.

1187
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,880
Iím going to look.

1188
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,120
Who am I choking in this picture?

1189
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,120
Thatís Drew Nami.

1190
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,680
I thought Drew Nami was on the other side.

1191
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,680
No, thatís Drew.

1192
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:03,680
Oh, thatís cool.

1193
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,240
You got a bunch of like Orange Lawns radio listeners there.

1194
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Thatís cool.

1195
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,240
I like that.

1196
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
Definitely.

1197
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,240
Very nice.

1198
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
One of my friends, Ken, he took the picture for all of us.

1199
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,240
Great.

1200
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,560
Yeah, I noticed that there was a lot of folks there from chat room, like I recognize some

1201
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,560
of the folks.

1202
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,560
Awesome.

1203
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,080
I didnít know you took a picture of my Dolphys on the table.

1204
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,160
Yeah, you asked me to do it.

1205
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,520
No, the one in the hotel room.

1206
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,520
Oh, yeah.

1207
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,320
Oh, I thought you knew about that one.

1208
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,320
No, but thatís cool.

1209
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,320
Itís a good picture.

1210
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Oh, thatís sweet.

1211
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
All right.

1212
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,840
Anything else you want to share with us, Rama?

1213
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,000
The last picture of you and William together in the chat room, the one that everybody loves.

1214
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Thank you very much.

1215
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Thatís very sweet.

1216
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Youíre welcome.

1217
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, God.

1218
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Is that in the gallery?

1219
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yes.

1220
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Are you putting personal pictures?

1221
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
All right.

1222
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Thatís my trip picture still.

1223
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
All right.

1224
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,240
I see, because at the very end, oh, yeah, Dark Sakuraís pinball.

1225
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,240
All that stuff at her house.

1226
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
Yes.

1227
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,240
All the crazy pinball in her place.

1228
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,240
Oh, yeah.

1229
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
Thereís my friend John.

1230
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
How funny.

1231
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,400
I decided next year, though, that Iím going to do Lolita Mario.

1232
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Oh, yes.

1233
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,520
Dude, the gosh-a-mon cosplayers, thatís great.

1234
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,520
Of course.

1235
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,520
All right.

1236
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,480
Well, Rama, thanks so much for coming out.

1237
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,160
You are a true fan, pretty hardcore, for coming out all the way to California to see the Orange

1238
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,800
Lounge panel and hang with us and go to Fonomay and all that, too, but youíre just awesome.

1239
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Thatís all.

1240
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,360
Well, plus, it was my birthday the day before.

1241
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,120
This was originally like a giant birthday gift to myself.

1242
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
True that.

1243
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
Well, happy late birthday a little bit.

1244
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
Yeah.

1245
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Yeah.

1246
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,840
Iíll be seeing you this weekend, a couple of coming weekends.

1247
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,840
Yeah, definitely.

1248
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
All right.

1249
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,200
I will be posting a forum so we can get things cracking for that.

1250
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,200
All right.

1251
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,200
Just make sure it happens Sunday afternoon, because thatís the time I got.

1252
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,200
Sure.

1253
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,200
No problem.

1254
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,200
All right.

1255
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,200
Sounds good.

1256
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,200
All right.

1257
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,200
Later.

1258
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Later.

1259
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,200
All right.

1260
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,200
Letís go to some more calls.

1261
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
Hello.

1262
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1263
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,200
Whoís this?

1264
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
Ravenstaufen.

1265
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,200
Hello, Ravenstaufen.

1266
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,200
Whatís on your mind?

1267
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Match game.

1268
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,200
Yeah.

1269
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,200
What about match game?

1270
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,000
I donít know if you realize, but GSM, when they used to do match game online, and I was

1271
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,840
really good at it, and I got on the board on TV that said your name on it, I was heavily

1272
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,200
addicted to that for a long, long time.

1273
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,240
Donít they still do that?

1274
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:17,800
Yeah, but Comcast being dicks, they took off GSM entirely down here, and Iím pissed.

1275
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,880
Oh, that sucks.

1276
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,880
So thatís kind of cool.

1277
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,880
Yeah, thatís right.

1278
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,160
You know, we donít talk a whole lot about casual games on the show, certainly, but thatís

1279
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,720
pretty cool that they have the, you know, you can play along with the game shows and

1280
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,720
stuff.

1281
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,720
Iíve actually never done that.

1282
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
I should sometime.

1283
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,600
I love myself some game show network, so there you go.

1284
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,640
Yeah, but we cheated sometimes because some people had the, they watch it so many times,

1285
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:45,080
they write down the answers, and they would post it up in the chat room, and we would

1286
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,480
get on the leaderboard every time.

1287
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,480
It was great.

1288
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,480
Awesome.

1289
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,480
What else do you want to share with us tonight?

1290
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,920
What else do I want to share with you tonight?

1291
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,800
Letís see.

1292
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,800
Not much.

1293
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,080
I just want to just point that out, and thatís about it.

1294
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,600
Thereís no one more thing tonight?

1295
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,920
Well, I updated my website.

1296
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,800
You want to hear about that?

1297
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
Sure, why not?

1298
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,800
Cheap website plug.

1299
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,800
Go for it.

1300
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:12,800
Make it quick.

1301
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,800
Checkinggame.com.

1302
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,040
Oh, I just remembered what I want to talk to you about.

1303
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,040
All right, there you go.

1304
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
What?

1305
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,040
Hotel Gus.

1306
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,040
Room 215.

1307
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,400
I donít know much about, well, I mean, I take that back.

1308
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,480
I know about the game.

1309
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,240
I havenít played the game because itís just one of those games that is, you know, I canít

1310
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,120
play every game that comes out.

1311
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,120
What about it though?

1312
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,040
Itís not like Phoenix Wright, but I enjoy it.

1313
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,540
I thought it was very enjoyable.

1314
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,240
What makes it so enjoyable?

1315
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:46,320
Well, you play this guy called Kyle Hyde, and he goes to his place, and the room is

1316
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
magical.

1317
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,800
So this room grants wishes.

1318
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,840
So he goes in there, he doesnít know anything, and Iím not going to spoil anything.

1319
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,620
So he goes in there, and heís trying to find something out about his friend.

1320
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,440
So itís very interesting how all of this comes together.

1321
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,440
Interesting.

1322
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,600
Well, I mean, I know Mieglatov has the game, so Iíll have to borrow it from him at some

1323
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,240
point and give a more fair review on the show later.

1324
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:14,040
Yeah, itís very enjoyable, I thought, but it is a lot of reading.

1325
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,500
So for you people that hate Super Paper Mario, youíre probably going to hate this too.

1326
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,880
Do you hate Super Paper Mario because thereís too much reading, Loki?

1327
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,440
No, thereís not.

1328
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,600
Well, there is a lot of reading in the game.

1329
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,320
Itís because it gets too repetitive towards the end.

1330
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,960
Thereís actual parts in the game where the whole world disappears, and then you have

1331
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,680
to run along blankness for about a few minutes, and itís kind of annoying.

1332
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:46,360
Or the Pit of 100 Trials, I know itís a side quest, but itís like 90 minutes of just fighting

1333
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,800
enemies over 100 levels.

1334
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
Itís kind of annoying.

1335
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,800
Interesting.

1336
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,800
All right.

1337
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,800
Well, anything else real quick, Ravenstaufen?

1338
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Iím looking at Ramaís pictures in the background.

1339
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Anything else, Ravenstaufen?

1340
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,800
Oh, sorry.

1341
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,800
Sorry.

1342
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
Thatís all right.

1343
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:03,800
Yeah, I just updated my website, and I just want people to know how it looks, techiegames.com.

1344
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,800
All right.

1345
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:05,800
There it is.

1346
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,800
All right.

1347
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Well, thank you so much for the phone call.

1348
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
Have a great day.

1349
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:09,800
Bye.

1350
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,800
Bye.

1351
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,800
All right.

1352
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,800
Bye.

1353
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:13,800
All right.

1354
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,800
If you want to give us a call, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge

1355
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,800
Radio.

1356
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Hi.

1357
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,800
Youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

1358
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,800
Whoís this?

1359
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,800
Hey.

1360
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
This is BlackDevilRX.

1361
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,800
Hello, BlackDevilRX.

1362
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,800
Whatís on your mind?

1363
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,800
Not much.

1364
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:32,520
Iím trying to get a Wii, but San Francisco seems to be out of Wiis.

1365
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,520
You know what?

1366
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,280
So does Sacramento and a lot of areas seem to still be out of Wiis after all this time.

1367
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,840
Matt, you can give us the distribution angle here, I suppose.

1368
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,040
What the hellís going on?

1369
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,640
Thereís still some coming in.

1370
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,040
Itís just slow.

1371
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,160
Itís still everythingís under allocations and everything.

1372
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,920
Is there a particular time thatís best to check, like Sunday mornings seem to be pretty

1373
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
good?

1374
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
No, not really.

1375
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,920
I was called with Virgin, and they were like, ìOh, well, we have 20 on Backorder.î

1376
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,080
A lot of places are keeping them under wraps until Sundays when they put out their ads.

1377
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,080
Thatís why.

1378
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,920
For a lot of retail chains.

1379
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,760
EB Games hasnít seen one for two weeks.

1380
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,760
Wow.

1381
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,760
Have you thought about it?

1382
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:16,000
Can you still do pre-orders with these guys, or do they not do that anymore?

1383
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I donít know.

1384
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,320
I kind of hesitate to do stuff online because I kind of had a real bad experience with it,

1385
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,440
but I suppose thatís one thing I could do.

1386
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,560
James Patrick in chat says, ìMy Toys R Us got 200 of them on Memorial Day.

1387
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,520
I was there trying to get one.

1388
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,440
Sold out in 30 minutes.î

1389
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,220
Thatís crazy.

1390
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,320
My God.

1391
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,640
After all this time?

1392
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,640
Seriously?

1393
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,640
Wow.

1394
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,080
I guess that just goes to show, Wiiís still a pretty darn successful system.

1395
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
Itís pretty amazing.

1396
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,080
Itís amazing.

1397
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,840
Iím going to get one for myself as a graduation present.

1398
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,680
Well, what have you been playing since youíre Wii-less?

1399
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,920
Actually, Iíve been playing a lot of Super Smash Brothers on the GameCube.

1400
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,180
There you go.

1401
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,440
In anticipation for the new one on the Wii someday?

1402
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,440
There you go.

1403
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,520
What do you think about all the stuff theyíve announced on the site recently, like the musicians

1404
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,280
and the power-ups and all that, and using the GameCube controller?

1405
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,080
I havenít actually checked out the site lately, but Iíve heard that Snakeís going to be

1406
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,400
in there, which is kind of cool.

1407
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
All right.

1408
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,400
Very cool.

1409
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,160
I hope they have more of those single-player type modes.

1410
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,880
Remember how they had the old-school Mario level that you played Mario?

1411
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Oh, yeah.

1412
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
That stuff was so cool.

1413
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,520
I hope they have more of that.

1414
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
All right.

1415
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,800
Well, BlackDevlerX, thank you so much for the call, and good luck on your hunt for a

1416
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,800
Wii.

1417
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,800
Try Sunday mornings.

1418
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,800
Thatís the best advice we got.

1419
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
All right.

1420
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
All right.

1421
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,800
Later, dude.

1422
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,800
All right.

1423
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:38,200
If you would like to give us a call, you can give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user

1424
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,320
name is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1425
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,760
Weíll take one more call here, and then weíre going to go ahead and call it a night on the

1426
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,560
Skype line and do some last-minute stories, although it does seem to me itís been kind

1427
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,320
of a slow news week, huh?

1428
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,320
Little bit.

1429
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,320
Compared to usual.

1430
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,320
Maybe itís because of Memorial Day.

1431
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,320
It kind of got in the way.

1432
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:00,080
A lot of folks, video game employees, want to go camping too, so there you go.

1433
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,080
All right.

1434
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,080
I saw some other calls coming in.

1435
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,080
I saw some others hitting on the line.

1436
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,800
God, my pinball room is hot.

1437
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,800
It really is.

1438
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,480
And thereís pictures of my garage with my amazing washing machine with my laundry in

1439
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,480
it.

1440
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,120
Thereís pictures of my huge ass on there.

1441
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,520
God, it looks horrible.

1442
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,760
My ass doesnít look so bad in that picture.

1443
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,560
You see that Rocky and Bullinkle machine?

1444
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,560
Uh-huh.

1445
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,560
Thatís mine.

1446
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Thatís an awesome machine.

1447
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,560
I like that.

1448
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,920
The Twilight Zoneís mine too because the play board was made on my birthday.

1449
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,320
Now, I wish they would have gotten a shot of the bride and pinball machine because it

1450
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
was all in pieces.

1451
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,320
Yeah.

1452
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,280
It was being shopped out.

1453
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,120
I think it has some problem with the brideís face because we had it all pulled out.

1454
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,240
Dan or Will could probably tell you better what was going on with it.

1455
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,240
Crazy.

1456
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,240
All right.

1457
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,240
We finally get another call.

1458
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,240
Letís take this.

1459
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,240
This will be our last call.

1460
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,240
Hi.

1461
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,240
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

1462
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,240
Whoís this?

1463
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,240
I donít time.

1464
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,240
I got through.

1465
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,240
Gee, whoís Dark Knight?

1466
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,240
Hey, Dark Knight.

1467
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,240
Itís just a timing thing.

1468
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,560
Itís like a minute and a half and weíre sitting here going, ìDuh, duh, duh, duh,

1469
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,560
duh, duh.î Well, you got through.

1470
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,560
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

1471
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:07,200
I want to talk about something I posted on the website recently about a price cut in

1472
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,520
Lumen Falls next-gen system.

1473
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
Okay.

1474
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:18,080
I mean, I would think that I knew it was coming, but this early was kind of a shocker.

1475
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,080
Being this early was kind of a big shocker to me.

1476
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,080
Wait.

1477
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,080
Read that by me again because you were breaking up a little.

1478
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,080
You say price cuts?

1479
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,080
Yeah.

1480
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:28,120
I said there might be a possible next-gen price cut.

1481
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,640
What makes this information more substantial than that?

1482
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,520
To be fair, it seems like every month weíre getting some rumor of an upcoming price cut

1483
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,640
and we have yet to really see a big one.

1484
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:43,240
I mean, basically, the latest I got was that they said that Microsoft was going to go first

1485
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,280
at the end of the summer and like a $50 drop.

1486
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,840
I would honestly think Microsoftís in a safe place right now until Sony drops it.

1487
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,840
Well, I donít know.

1488
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,960
I think Microsoft wants to try and get down there to compete with the Wii a little more

1489
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,440
because honestly, if they dropped their core by $50, theyíd be the same price as a Wii,

1490
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,440
right?

1491
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,440
Thatís what they was intending.

1492
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,520
They wanted to be at least the same price as a Wii, the core.

1493
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,840
I donít see why not.

1494
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,920
That seems to make a lot of sense.

1495
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,920
What do you think, Loki?

1496
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,960
Again, I want your angle on this because youíre kind of on the inside in this.

1497
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,680
Well, I donít think that they have any firm plans on dropping any price, but obviously,

1498
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,840
theyíre probably going to be ready to if other companies do it.

1499
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,120
Some console makers are probably going to have to drop the price of their system, but

1500
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,120
then again, all these analysts just saying, ìOh, thereís a price drop coming.î Yeah,

1501
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,640
thereís a price drop coming eventually.

1502
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,520
Theyíre just trying to get out there and say, ìHey, see?

1503
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,520
We called it.

1504
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,920
Weíre really good at analyzing stuff.

1505
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,160
Look at us.î I would say, because weíre analysts, too,

1506
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,160
of sorts.

1507
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,200
I mean, really, what do we do on this show for the past five years, right?

1508
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:47,140
So I would say if a price cutís coming, itís going to be just before the Christmas rush.

1509
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:51,920
So I would say, honestly, price cuts, I think end of summer is a good call, September.

1510
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,960
I would say youíre going to see some massive price cuts in September, but when I say maybe

1511
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,920
like 50 bucks, 50 bucks on the 360 and the Wii, maybe even, especially if itísÖ

1512
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,920
Oh, no.

1513
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,040
The source I got at it from, they said Nintendo might not, would probably not think about

1514
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:11,340
it, but maybe like just maybe the 360 and the PS3, possibly.

1515
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,040
What if Nintendo announced this?

1516
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,080
Because we still know the Wiis are coming in different colors, right?

1517
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,080
Yeah.

1518
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,080
Theyíll release the Wiis in different colors with no game included, $199.

1519
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,080
There you go.

1520
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,080
Yeah.

1521
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,080
That would be good.

1522
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,080
Yeah?

1523
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,880
I think I could do it right there or put in some other type of pack-in, like, I donít

1524
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:29,880
know, demos or I donít know.

1525
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,840
But yeah, just take Wii Sports out of the picture, charge $199 for the colored Wiis.

1526
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,840
Yeah.

1527
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,840
I could probably see that happening.

1528
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:37,840
There you go.

1529
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,800
I mean, it just, I mean, I knew it was coming, but I kind of figured maybe you might see

1530
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:47,320
like maybe another year, at least.

1531
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:52,560
Iím telling you, by September, $50 price cuts on Wii and 360, $100 price cut on PS3.

1532
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,560
Yeah.

1533
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,360
If I was a bad man, there it is.

1534
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,440
I say a $100 price cut on PS3.

1535
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,440
They have to.

1536
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,440
They have to.

1537
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,440
Yeah, I know.

1538
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,840
Then again, they donít have to, actually, because what they could do is just, since

1539
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:10,200
theyíve already dropped their 60 gig or whatever, dropped the 80 gig at the same price as their

1540
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,200
60 and maybe doÖ

1541
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,760
Throw in a game or something to make it.

1542
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,840
Well, not necessarily throw it in a game, but do the 20 gig price for the 60 gig now.

1543
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,400
Okay, then if they donít cut it by 100, theyíll put something in there to sweeten the deal.

1544
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,400
That would be theÖ

1545
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,400
Right.

1546
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,080
Like maybe theyíll drop it by 50, but put $50 worth of extra crap in it, like another

1547
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,080
game.

1548
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,840
The hard drive increase, like youíre saying, is something like that.

1549
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,840
I could see that.

1550
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,760
But Sonyís going to have to do something to sweeten the deal.

1551
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,760
Yeah.

1552
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,760
I mean, worst case scenario is that if, like I said, PlayStation 3 does make that cut,

1553
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,680
you probably going to see the PS2 hit the $99 mark.

1554
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,320
And then N-Gageís, theyíre going to have to give them away for free.

1555
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,320
Yeah.

1556
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,160
Because thatís the only way Dark Soccer ever touched one was she got it for free.

1557
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,160
And honestly, they may have to pay me $20 to take an N-Gage.

1558
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,400
I mean, I saw the thing and I was like, ìI canít believe you told that.î You exactly

1559
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,400
told that.

1560
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,400
All right.

1561
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,720
Well, thank you so much Dark Knight for your call and weíll see what happens on the price

1562
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,720
cut front.

1563
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,720
All right?

1564
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,720
All right.

1565
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
Thank you.

1566
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
All right.

1567
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Take care, buddy.

1568
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,720
Bye.

1569
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,720
Bye.

1570
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,720
Bye.

1571
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,720
Bye.

1572
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:15,720
Lots and lots of comments from chat here.

1573
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:16,720
Letís see.

1574
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,480
Rob D. says, ìI wouldnít be enjoying my 360 half as much if I wasnít a member of

1575
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,480
an online community.

1576
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,080
The Wii doesnít really have much of anything going for it at the moment beyond the Virtual

1577
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,280
Console.î Interesting.

1578
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,200
James Patrick says, ìPlayStation 2 wonít drop to $99 for a while.

1579
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:37,360
Sony needs the profit from its current price.î Letís see.

1580
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:42,440
James Patrick says, ìPlayStation 3 sales are in the gutter that needs to increase.

1581
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:48,000
Software-wise, I mean, hardware is important too, but software is what counts.î Black

1582
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,960
Boy says, ìThe 360 has been out considerably longer than the Wii, but in terms of sales,

1583
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:59,880
Wii is outselling 360 by crazy amounts.î Very interesting perspectives there in chat.

1584
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:05,960
BlackDevil or X says, ìWeíre using the Dreamcast as the minimum bar for sales.î Interesting.

1585
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,400
All right.

1586
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,960
Of course, if you have more comments, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeontrader.com,

1587
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:15,820
and weíll read those emails next week on theÖ actually, not next week, but in two

1588
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,280
weeks on the program, because a reminder, there will be no show next week.

1589
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,400
Letís go around and see if thereís any last-minute stories.

1590
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,240
Actually, I found something interesting.

1591
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,240
Yes.

1592
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,520
Just some early pictures of the Guitar Hero 3 Les Paul controller.

1593
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,520
Pretty freaking cool.

1594
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,880
Whatís so special about it?

1595
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,520
Well, itís, you know, theyíve done two other Gibson guitars.

1596
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:44,760
They did, you know, probably one of, in my opinion, one of their best, but Iíll, actually

1597
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:47,640
Iím going to link the article in the chatroom so they can see the pictures.

1598
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:52,480
It actually looks really sweet, and the buttons on it are black with the colored outlines.

1599
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:59,960
Itís really a lot different than the other controllers have looked, more minimalist.

1600
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:04,080
All right.

1601
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,080
Anything else?

1602
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,080
No.

1603
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,080
Loki.

1604
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:12,000
Anyway, so, I actually got quite a few things.

1605
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,200
First off, some interesting stuff coming out.

1606
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,640
Well, first off, thereís supposed to be a rumor that the next issue of EGM is going

1607
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:27,000
to reveal a brand-new Soul Calibur title, not Soul Calibur Legends, Iím guessing, although

1608
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
who knows.

1609
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Maybe theyíre doing that again.

1610
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,120
We could use the next-gen Soul Calibur game.

1611
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,120
That would be pretty awesome.

1612
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:36,560
A new Soul Calibur game possibly being announced, so that would be kind of neat.

1613
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:40,960
Another rumor thatís going on, apparently a website RPG Gamer had an interview with

1614
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:49,760
NS America, and one of the questions was, according to the Q&A, one of the answers to

1615
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:54,240
a question, ìIs Disgaea coming into any other platforms?î They mentioned the DS.

1616
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,840
So you might get Disgaea on the DS soon.

1617
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,600
Letís see here.

1618
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:06,760
So thereís an interesting thing going on.

1619
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:12,960
Apparently a certain lawyer type, by the name of Jack, was supposed to beó

1620
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,960
Voldemort?

1621
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,960
You mean Lord Voldemort?

1622
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:22,200
Yeah, Voldemort, was apparently going to be debating or participate in a debate during

1623
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
PAX this year.

1624
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,160
Of course, itís supposed to be kept under wraps, and no word if heís going to back

1625
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,880
out of that one.

1626
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,360
I had heard he already did, because he put out some retort toóhe thought it was infringing

1627
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:38,680
on his free speech that they werenít going to advertise his appearance, blah, blah, blah.

1628
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,880
Who cares what that asshole has to say?

1629
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:49,520
Another interesting thing is console modder Ben Heck is going to be working on a portable

1630
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,880
game system thatís going to be focused around retro games called the Game Port.

1631
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:02,560
Itís supposed to be having a five hour battery life, a 480x234 pixel screen, and video out

1632
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,680
for playing on your television, as well as SD card for game storage and etc.

1633
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:12,960
So kind of nifty to see him actually making a console instead of modding them.

1634
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,340
Speaking about homebrew stuff, there was a game I talked about on the show a while back

1635
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,840
called No Gravity.

1636
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,440
Itís kind of like a Descent Free Space type game.

1637
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,800
I think I showed it to you, Rob, one time.

1638
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,740
The best fucking homebrew game ever on the PSP, and theyíre actually going to have it

1639
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:30,160
finished in June.

1640
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,720
Full version will be coming out for free!

1641
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:39,640
And itís really sad, because the game can wipe most of those other PSP games out there.

1642
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,920
And itís developed independently and for free.

1643
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,800
So check out No Gravity later on this month.

1644
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,860
And letís see here.

1645
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:54,920
Another thing thatís kind of interesting, also a trademark, apparently Capcom made a

1646
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,640
trademark for Apollo Justice.

1647
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,280
Thereís two rumors regarding this.

1648
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,800
Some people think itís going to be a new Rival Schools game, because apparently I guess

1649
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,000
the school is named Apollo or something like that.

1650
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,480
No, itís Justice.

1651
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,480
Justice.

1652
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:19,560
Anyways, the other theory is that itís a subtitle for the next Phoenix Wright game.

1653
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,800
Well, it could be either or, huh?

1654
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,800
Yeah, interesting.

1655
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,680
I want more Rival Schools, please.

1656
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,680
Alright.

1657
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:31,120
I have a real quick last minute story as well, and Loki, youíll like this one, I think.

1658
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,640
1UP recently had an interview with the creator of the Mega Man franchise, and they were asking

1659
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,280
about sequels and bringing Mega Man to the next-gen platforms.

1660
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,720
And he basically said, ìWell, donít know if we would be able to recoup the cost of

1661
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,400
making a game on the next-gen platforms.î But they said, ìCome on, just imagine money

1662
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,400
wasnít an issue.

1663
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,400
What would you do?î

1664
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:55,640
And he said, ìI think it would probably be Mega Man Legends 3, and thatís not just me.

1665
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,680
A lot of the original team members would also love to make a sequel.

1666
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,680
They talk about it.

1667
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,680
I talk about it sometimes.

1668
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,880
I know they love that series, and so do I.

1669
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,040
If I were to say right now I have a tiny, tiny, tiny dream that I wish I could realize,

1670
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,920
but I donít know if itís possible, it would be to do a sequel in the Legends series.î

1671
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,280
Hell yeah, thatís a series that they need to take even further, because these other

1672
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,280
series kind of suck.

1673
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,360
No, thatís a series they need to shoot in the head, put it down like an old horse.

1674
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,360
Put it down.

1675
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,760
Give me more Mega Man X, please.

1676
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,760
I love the Legends series.

1677
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,840
Sorry, Iím a 2D gamer.

1678
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,720
I would like to see some type of next-gen Mega Man.

1679
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,440
I think itís okay to do a 2D Mega Man.

1680
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,480
Continue Legends series on the Wii.

1681
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
Itís perfect.

1682
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,280
I mean, it was an original PlayStation game.

1683
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,680
You can definitely push those kind of graphics on that system.

1684
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,560
Itís not Mega Man.

1685
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,560
Who cares?

1686
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,560
I do.

1687
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,560
I love Mega Man.

1688
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:50,960
For me, just to have it go 3D in the first place was like ripping out my heart and dancing

1689
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,280
the lombata on it.

1690
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,280
No, you like the Mega Man X series and the original Mega Man series.

1691
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,640
This is a different series.

1692
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,440
Just like the Marvel series, how they have like the Marvel 2017 series and the Marvel

1693
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,040
Universe series and all this other stuff, well, it doesnít matter.

1694
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,320
Just donít have to like this series.

1695
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,600
I like this series, so they should make another one.

1696
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:15,040
All I could say is please anything but those tactical games on the DS.

1697
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,040
Oh, man.

1698
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,040
Oh, my God.

1699
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,040
I think we can all agree on that.

1700
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,040
That series put it to bed.

1701
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,240
Well, going on the same thing, though, that Loki is saying, thatís actually based off

1702
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:28,280
of a completely different series, the Mega Man EXE is what those were.

1703
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,200
Yeah, or the Battle Network, thatís what it was called.

1704
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,560
Well, it was Rockman EXE.

1705
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
Put it to bed.

1706
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,680
It was actually based off of an anime.

1707
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,680
Put a bullet in its head and be done.

1708
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,200
Itís not the same type of thing.

1709
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,240
This is supposed to be Mega Man.

1710
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:44,960
This is actually something 100% completely different, just borrowing the name.

1711
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,120
It makes sense why itís a different type of game.

1712
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,240
And James Patrick says in chat, Mega Man, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero,

1713
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,240
Mega Man Battle Network.

1714
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,240
Mega Man, stop this.

1715
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,240
Stop it.

1716
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:01,720
As long as they donít do a next-gen series that looks like the cover of Mega Man 2 or

1717
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,720
something like that.

1718
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,720
Okay.

1719
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:10,280
The US Capcom art in those days, I mean, did you see the cover for Bionic Commando?

1720
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,280
They were pretty awful.

1721
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:17,280
The only cool game that had any, you know, American redone art that was any good was

1722
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:23,480
like Metal Gear, because the dude looked like, you know, hardcore awesome.

1723
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,880
Oh no, the truck half started to move.

1724
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,000
The least in Bionic Commando, you can kill Hitler.

1725
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,440
Yeah, and you know what, some of the, I always think of the box art even back from the Atari

1726
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,960
2600 days, where they had these elaborate artwork on the box, which of course the game

1727
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,000
looked nothing like, because it was just a bunch of blocks on the screen.

1728
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,120
It was just, I donít know.

1729
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,120
Box artís funny.

1730
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,760
Anyhow, thatís going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it

1731
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,760
or not.

1732
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,240
Letís go around and get everybodyís final thought.

1733
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:52,800
Dark Soccer, why donít you start us off tonight.

1734
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,800
Your final thought.

1735
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:59,200
Um, okay, I thought it.

1736
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,400
My final thought is ice cream.

1737
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,360
Loki, your final thought.

1738
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,120
My final thought is this screen for the Wii thing.

1739
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,120
It looks kind of neat.

1740
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,120
Itís like a portable screen.

1741
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,120
I donít know though, I still wouldnít buy it.

1742
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,160

No.

1753
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,440
