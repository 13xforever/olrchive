14246	24845	Tonight, January 21st, 2007, more Final Fantasy XIII details emerge, new developments for the Guitar Hero series including Drum Villain, and can you fix a broken 360 with towels?
32995	36336	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
36396	40457	I say welcome back because, you know, we missed a show last week, but we'll get into that in a moment.
40517	41717	First, let's introduce ourselves.
42097	47639	We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about, video game culture and the video game lifestyle.
48059	49099	My name is Rob Roberts.
49239	52420	Joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
52820	53500	Yo, what up?
53700	54481	How you doing, Ms.
54521	54861	Summers?
55481	55581	Um...
56804	58106	I'm alive, sort of.
58327	59309	That's good, that's good.
59609	62794	I had a very good time last week on our weekend off with you.
62815	63916	I had a great time.
64397	67402	Myself and DarkSakura and the OLR lesbians all went to Disneyland.
67703	68324	It was a good time.
69085	70267	We had a very...
71795	72455	Interesting time.
72615	77898	And I know some listeners sometimes give Jamie a hard time because she talks about Disneyland a lot on this show, and I'm one of them.
78098	80940	I give her a hard time talking about Disneyland so much on this program.
81360	82761	But I kind of get it now.
82841	86263	I really had a great time, and it really is something else.
86343	88084	Space Mountain four times.
88324	90205	Rocking Space Mountain four times in a row was awesome.
90585	91606	I think it's just really cool.
92685	95026	I remember that, you know, we have day jobs.
95086	96587	OLR is not what we do for a living.
96627	100769	And then it's just kind of nice to have a week off to go have nothing but fun.
100809	104230	And that's what Disneyland was really all about, was just fun and good friends and good times.
104310	105151	And it was great.
105171	105811	I had a really good time.
106131	106871	So group hug.
107672	107912	All right.
108212	110513	Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.
110793	110893	Hello.
110913	112314	How are you doing, Loki?
112334	113014	How was your week off?
113955	114375	It was okay.
114855	121458	I went to a friend's reception and we hung out there and...
121957	123958	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
150895	152456	What made you... But you quit again.
152556	153576	Yes, I quit again.
153657	156578	So what made you decide to start playing Final Fantasy XI and then quit again?
156638	163841	Because I missed it, and then when I came back, I played it, and then I didn't miss it anymore, so it was time to cancel.
163901	165922	What made you decide you did the right thing by quitting?
166863	168163	What do you mean, what made me decide?
168383	175647	Well, because you said you went back for two weeks, and then you quit, so obviously you must have come to the conclusion during those two weeks that, oh, I made the right decision quitting.
175667	175767	Well...
176562	192898	because being a blue mage is freaking boring trying to get those spells and when you spend two hours hunting this one monster trying to get one spell off of it you realize that your time could be better spent somewhere else like looking for a party alright
193543	196505	Look at the chat room comments here at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
196525	199747	We always invite the chatters to always be another guest here on the program.
200247	201408	And they have their comments.
201528	203209	We have some really good voicemails this week, by the way.
203229	207272	We're going to get to later on in Part B. And just another way we encourage you guys to interact with us.
208292	212094	Shadowslayer says, just sat around and talked equals strippers.
212595	213035	Is this true?
213055	216217	No, it's in his mom's coffee shop.
216857	219879	So sitting around and talking is literally sitting around and talking.
220099	221660	Lattes and strippers, good times.
222421	222781	I wish.
222801	222961	I wish.
224292	228276	Nellie and I were hoping for strippers with fireworks and jetpacks.
228716	233400	I actually almost got somebody to believe that that was going to happen, but they were an idiot, so it doesn't matter.
234101	235883	That would be Kat, and she was an idiot.
237104	239146	Does Kat listen to this program?
239166	240046	Can she defend herself?
240207	242008	I don't think she knows how to operate a computer.
243309	244470	She's a complete idiot.
244811	245051	All right.
245989	251432	Well, welcome back, of course, to all of our live listeners and our podcast listeners since there was no program last week.
251492	265200	Again, we apologize for not being here, but now that the holidays are over and we're all back into our daily routine, unfortunately, we're kind of in a situation where Jamie's doing school in the early evenings and Loki has to go to bed early for his job, which takes out the late evenings.
265561	268282	So it's very hard for us to prerecord when we're not here on Sundays.
268342	269803	So sorry about that, but that's what happened.
270583	277612	If you were here listening live, though, Travis Donovan from our Saturday night program on Orange Lounge Radio did a real fantastic little tribute program.
278172	287164	And if you listen to one of our buddy podcasts, All Games Interactive, DarkSakura and I appeared on the Friday edition, and it was something else.
289494	290155	It was a good time, though.
313857	322457	It was a good time, I had a really good time Thanks to Scott for having us on It's good, I like doing radio with Scott Because he plays such different types of games than we do
323254	324515	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
352654	353294	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
384493	387834	Astro Blasters is one of the best video games I've ever played in my life.
387894	388995	That was some good times.
389235	392256	And we might be getting another pinball machine that you would be interested in.
393316	393676	What's that?
393996	394636	Bride of Pinbot.
395156	395697	Sweet.
396577	396957	Very cool.
396977	397997	I told Dan to try to get it for me.
398658	399878	Not a lot of console stuff otherwise?
400318	400798	Not really.
400818	406140	I almost got rid of PSU and then went, meh.
406240	409641	I turned on Guild Wars and then said, meh.
413798	417460	Just when it went through the whole booting and patching and that whole process, you were like, eh, nah.
417900	418500	Yeah, pretty much.
419661	420041	That was it.
420281	420861	All right, good times.
421602	422702	Loki, how was your gaming week?
423263	424043	My gaming week was good.
424143	442491	We had a gaming party last night, actually, and Rob was there, and he can attest to the fact WarioWare Smooth Moves is fun, but playing it with 11 people at the same time is crazy, and it adds a whole new element of fun into it that
444047	450670	I have never had a video gaming experience quite like 11-player WarioWare.
451791	453052	I don't know how to describe it.
453112	453672	It was insanity.
454132	458134	Just so you guys know, in WarioWare, you only get to use one baton.
458995	460816	They call it the baton in the game, but it's Wiimote.
461127	463708	You only get to use one Wiimote in multiplayer.
464029	466550	So part of the... And you might say, no, that's stupid.
466590	467691	Why don't they make it four?
468011	471593	Part of the fun of it was actually passing off the baton in time to other people.
471613	472613	It was actually kind of funny.
473034	474394	Because the whole thing is ridiculous.
474434	477736	They have your Miis flying around like this angel form.
478437	480758	And it's just like, it really looks weird.
480918	487562	And so you have all these weird Miifaces with this angel body thing that doesn't even fit.
487622	488222	And then you have
488883	492226	These games that you're playing keeps getting faster, and everyone was just cracking up.
492286	493467	It was just a lot of fun.
493787	496589	Did you notice how OLR totally dominated the multiplayer games?
496609	500692	Because you won one, Miklatov won one, Extrofer won one, and I won one.
500912	501673	We played it four times.
501793	502914	Well, we play games more than that.
502934	503234	No, I know.
503254	503634	That's true.
504755	505316	So we did that.
505356	506336	That was really fun.
506717	510820	But that just goes to say, at this gamer party, you had some, would you say, casual gamers there?
510860	514843	What were the level of people like Tiffany and Heather and the other Rob...
515363	516623	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
540494	541074	So that's funny.
541094	544215	And then Mel, of course, you know, plays some stuff.
545016	548537	And, you know, everyone plays, you know, pretty average amount of games and stuff.
550297	552238	So I think a lot of people, you know, really liked it.
552318	557980	And, you know, definitely people that were going to get a Wii are probably going to get this game as well because it's just crazy.
559160	562001	And the dance mini game was hilarious.
562990	565392	Yeah, Shane shared this idea with us that you can do the dance.
565572	571657	You go into the mode where you just play a minigame over and over again, and you do the dance minigame, but you set it on the fastest setting.
572057	572618	It's pretty funny.
572858	573338	It's fun to watch.
573358	574639	Yeah, it's crazy.
575200	579123	And then we played Resistance Fallen Man.
579143	582746	I've been playing that all week during lunches, and we played that last night, too, for a while.
583146	585788	And I had a really interesting glitch after you left.
586438	587699	We were playing multiplayer.
587839	593084	First, we started off with just, you know, doing four-player multiplayer and stuff, and that's a fun game, multiplayer.
593704	599890	Then we decided, rockets only, infinite ammo, and so, and we picked really tiny maps, and that was pretty fun.
600110	603173	Except one part, um, I... Sounds like the Halo 2 games I played online, yeah.
603233	608417	Except one time, I spawned, and I just kept flying up into the air, so it was really weird.
609118	610118	Um, that was kind of funny.
610239	610599	And then...
611627	613489	You guys were playing Red Steel at one point too.
622188	623629	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
647732	658020	and so 4Player, I thought it'd be cool if we tried the mode where the Wiimote rings like a phone and you pick it up and you get a mission from the person on the line.
658481	663445	Well, it's a cool concept, but it's completely annoying and stupid at the same time.
663905	665145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
683308	684949	You know, this is the last draw for this game.
684989	686529	I'm definitely selling it back now.
686569	688950	I mean, it was a complete waste of money in the first place.
689410	690890	It's just an utter disappointment.
690950	693771	I wanted to give it a second chance, and so I did, and it's awful.
694211	696932	That's the first time you asked me, like, do you want to play this?
696952	698853	And I was like, no, I don't.
699353	701714	Yeah, so, you know, that really sucked.
701774	704915	And then, I'm trying to think what else we played there.
706495	707916	Rob D. in chat agrees with you.
708156	709556	Loki's right, phone mode sucks.
709636	711777	It always rings, you can't hear it, it's lame, and I hate it.
712838	720444	I mean, it sounded like a cool concept in the beginning, you know, when they were talking about it, but it's just horribly, horribly executed.
720544	722926	So, you know, I can't recommend that game at all.
723646	730271	And then, finally, I've been playing more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which I hear is now coming out on the PlayStation 2.
730591	733353	My boss will be extremely happy about that.
734014	735755	And just, you know, the usual stuff.
737216	740819	But, yeah, right now, WarioWare is going to have to hold me over until SSX comes out.
741832	747057	It kind of sucks with only one game coming out in a month, but that's about it.
747718	748078	All right.
749559	750560	Can I make an interjection?
750720	751141	Sure, why not?
751161	751822	There's one other game.
752002	752502	Okay, what's that?
753503	753763	R-Type 3.
754824	755885	Oh, on the Virtual Console?
756106	756466	Oh, yeah.
756646	757066	How was that?
757547	760570	Well, I actually never had R-Type 3 before, so it was actually really fun.
761150	765074	And I love the Mode 7-tastic stuff that happens in it.
765541	774888	I guess sort of mini-boss type things pop up.
774968	785395	You can kill him in one charge shot, and then another one comes up behind you, and then he swings around you, and then you bitch can't kill him, and then he suddenly looks behind him and runs into a wall and blows up.
786232	787493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
811385	813146	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
839625	848834	down to zero, everything except for Elite Beats on Jumping Jack Flash on Elite Beat D.Va's difficulty.
850195	855279	And let's see, I just picked up Final Fantasy 3 for the DS because it's in stock again, which is nice.
857462	861866	And I played Final Fantasy for two weeks, and now I'm playing Burning Crusade.
862987	863347	Oops.
864648	865429	How's Burning Crusade?
866495	869536	Night Elf, or Night Elf, Blood Elf is really pretty and he jumps around and twirls.
869617	870137	It's great.
870297	872778	What made you decide to go on to Burning Crusade?
874259	877920	Everybody else is doing it and I like to follow people.
878600	881142	So I'm easily swayed.
881782	882382	And it's fun.
882522	883223	I like it.
883303	883843	It's cool.
884123	884783	Alright, good times.
885023	886564	You want to tell people your server and characters?
886584	887544	They can come play with you?
887624	888625	Or would you rather stay anonymous?
888865	889325	I don't care.
889625	891926	My server is... What is my server?
892146	893127	Ravencrest...
893806	898607	and my character's name is Arx and I'm a 13 Blood Elf Priest.
898927	900547	Is there any reason why you chose a Ravencrest?
900687	904708	Because it reminded me of Ravenclaw because that sounds like something Harry Potter-ish.
905388	905668	Alright.
906549	915010	I was going to say, since you mentioned that Final Fantasy 3 is back in stock now, they've been actually sold out of a lot of stuff, especially the DS Lite.
915771	917871	Nintendo is actually completely sold out now.
917931	920172	They should be coming in stores in the next week or so.
920192	921652	I'm finally catching up.
921732	922292	Same with the Wii.
922776	924177	We've been sold out for a while, too.
924197	927039	Nintendo's kind of slow right now.
927540	930722	Sony's kind of showing them up with the amount of units they're getting out there, but no one's buying them.
932646	937270	Well, my gaming week, a lot of the same stuff most people have actually already beat me to and mentioned.
937290	940032	You know, there was Buzz Lightyear ride at Disneyland, which was a lot of fun.
940092	944636	And you know what's weird is that the first time we went through it, we rode that ride three times, and the first time was our best score.
944877	946718	We should post that picture on Orange Lounge somewhere.
946738	947299	It's kind of funny.
948139	951282	You got like the 38th best score for the day or something, the high score.
951302	951883	I think so.
951923	953104	You kicked my butt at it.
953364	956427	Out of how many thousands of people that...
957029	958870	I think they do it by day.
959250	963971	The only reason we got so high of a score, though, is because it broke down while we were on it.
966292	969473	Yeah, because the other times we never stopped in the middle of the ride.
969613	970813	I've done really well on that ride.
970853	973794	I can at least get to a rank four on a regular run through.
973994	978835	But then I was chatting from the hotel room with Bobby over at All Games, and he's like, well, I got a million.
978855	979556	Did you get a million?
979576	981696	I'm like, yeah, but his ride stopped too.
984117	984397	All right.
985053	986113	Um, so I played that.
986213	990515	I've, I've also, um, I've gone back to World of Warcraft, thanks to Burning Crusade.
990775	992915	Which is funny, though, because I didn't buy Burning Crusade.
993295	1003838	Um, I just, I, I decided, I don't, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me, because I'm not all like, ooh, ah, over Blood Elves and Draenei, because everybody is playing those.
1004138	1009860	And especially if you look at the server that Shane and I are playing on, Rave, because we always start on a freaking new server, Ravencrest.
1010931	1012732	I'm playing a tauren on Ravencrest.
1012912	1014313	I'm not writing into anybody.
1014533	1015593	It's like a new server.
1015833	1024037	All I see are blood elves and they're all paladins and they make me want to punch them because it's annoying because they all just kind of gang up on my kills I'm trying to get.
1024057	1025118	Yeah, so it's...
1026061	1026901	It's interesting.
1028062	1030423	And I thought, well, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me.
1030443	1031964	I mean, sure, there's new areas.
1031984	1033545	You can level to 70 in the Jewelcrafting.
1033845	1038728	But I'm like, okay, I don't want to make that investment unless I actually stick with World of Warcraft.
1038748	1041969	Because if you've been listening to this show for a couple years, you know that I'm notorious.
1042029	1046532	I'll play World of Warcraft for three months, quit, then start over again in a couple months on a new server.
1046552	1052695	So if I actually, I said, okay, Rob, if you can get a character to level 40, I will reward you by buying Burning Crusade.
1053595	1053995	There you go.
1054356	1055136	And I'm already at what?
1055834	1057295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1077230	1077750	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1104716	1105417	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1128977	1129959	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1140259	1140960	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1167442	1170444	But if you're a Nintendo fanboy, you probably already own it, so what are you listening to me for?
1171065	1172686	Well, would you agree with that, Loki?
1172926	1190237	You know, this whole thing kind of reminds me of, you know, there could be more life in this game if they had, I don't know, leaderboards or something like that supported on the Nintendo Wii, but since they don't, and Nintendo's a fucking retarded for not doing that, you know, there's not as much life as there could be.
1190957	1193079	You know, I don't know, simple...
1193632	1193933	All right.
1200706	1202767	I think that's about... Do I have anything else for my gaming week?
1202827	1203227	Not really.
1203267	1204728	I've just pretty much been playing those.
1204788	1207809	Not a whole lot of... Oh, no, there is one new game I wanted to mention also.
1208830	1212471	I bought Heavy Weapon on Xbox Live Arcade, which is a PopCap game.
1212491	1213952	You know, the folks that made Bejeweled and Zuma.
1214232	1215993	But Heavy Weapon is a very different type of game.
1216033	1216773	It's not a puzzle game.
1216813	1217593	It's more of an action game.
1217893	1219834	It reminds me of an old 16-bit shooter.
1220415	1226097	And a lot of people have been giving Heavy Weapon a lot of crap because, you know, they go, Oh, another PopCap game.
1226508	1227609	It's coming out after Ms.
1227649	1228190	Pac-Man.
1228330	1230792	God, the live arcade lineup sucks.
1230832	1234576	You know, well, I could play this on, you know, for free on Flash and da-da-da-da-da.
1235497	1239061	I think a lot of people are passing judgment on this game before playing it.
1239181	1243105	And I would bet some of your favorite bloggers are doing this, too, after reading one and reading some bloggers.
1243805	1247089	Because people were posting those types of opinions before the game even came out.
1247469	1250432	So they were basing their opinions, I know this, off the Flash version of the game.
1251195	1252195	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1272280	1273100	Thank you for watching!
1296088	1299470	If the website is good enough for you and you play the game with them, fine.
1299790	1300631	Then you don't need to spend the $10.
1301391	1305975	But if you enjoy those types of games, I think you'd really benefit from multiplayer and some of the other modes this game has.
1305995	1313860	I had a lot of fun with it and I kind of want to play it again when my TV's free of Elebits because Extifer's been playing Elebits nonstop.
1313880	1314241	He beat it.
1314441	1315422	I saw the final boss in the game.
1315442	1317643	It was like this Voltron Elebit type thing.
1317683	1318184	It's crazy.
1319104	1320785	I didn't know Elebits was so long.
1320805	1321586	I guess it has like 25, 26 stages.
1323240	1338054	and the stages in that game go on for like 10-20 minutes at a time so there's quite a bit of replayability in all of it so I was surprised so I do recommend Heavy Weapon for those fans of shooters at least even if you just have access to Xbox Live check out the demo you might like it so
1338766	1339387	Thanks for watching!
1355439	1361261	Also, just a reminder, we do have programming here on OrangeLawnTrader.com almost every weeknight throughout the week.
1361981	1366902	First Tuesday of every month, DarkSakura is live with Pump Up the Volume, so she's due for a new show pretty soon.
1367582	1369623	Wednesday nights, guys on a show, myself and Extover.
1370103	1373144	Thursday nights, STFU with DMN and DJ Tyrant.
1373184	1375444	Friday night, Club OLR mixed by Loki.
1375984	1382066	And Saturday nights, Travis Donovan live, which is always pretty hilarious, and he does a lot of the chat room interaction stuff too.
1382106	1382906	So check those shows out.
1384315	1385075	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1406244	1408486	Huge news happens literally in our backyard.
1408726	1409367	I mean literally.
1409727	1416993	And, of course, we're referring to the Hold Your Wii for a Wii contest that one of our local stations here, 1079, held.
1417554	1420636	Their morning rave show or whatever held this Hold Your Wii for a Wii contest.
1420936	1427522	And, unfortunately, it ended, or I should say resulted, because it was about a couple hours after the contest ended, resulted in the death of
1428118	1432202	Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old who was trying to win a Wii for her family.
1432883	1433964	It was very interesting.
1434004	1440230	Jennifer Strange lived not even about two miles from where we record Orange Lounge Radio.
1440430	1443933	So it was kind of weird, kind of hit home, that whole story.
1444914	1450139	And at first, I don't know about you guys when you heard about this, but at first I was kind of thinking, this isn't...
1451339	1455581	Because I was reading about it on, you know, Kotaku, Destructoid, and all those gaming blogs.
1455921	1457842	I was thinking, this really isn't about gaming.
1458343	1465466	I mean, I understand why these sites covered it, so I'm not trying to fault that or anything, but I'm kind of thinking to myself, we're really digging a hole for this.
1465526	1467107	I mean, it's not really about the gaming.
1467147	1478412	I mean, sure, it's a tragic story, but that goes more to the whole, where was the responsibility of the DJs, the station, the woman that competed in the contest, you know, all that types of back and forth.
1478873	1479353	But then...
1480251	1480611	DarkSakura.com
1500393	1501815	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1516992	1518934	So I'm thinking, okay, it's not really gaming related.
1519054	1521977	I don't know if we should talk about it on Sunday's show because it's kind of been talked about to death.
1522257	1523858	But then this late-breaking thing happened.
1523878	1527642	I caught the news on Thursday, and I posted about this to OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1528062	1530644	We were watching local news, and they were talking about this whole thing.
1530884	1538751	Well, the reporter, I guess, had talked to the lawyer, and the reporter said that they were considering expanding the lawsuit that was filed against the station.
1538771	1541534	I mean, obviously, a civil lawsuit was filed in her death.
1541594	1542755	I mean, I think we all saw that coming.
1543235	1551539	The lawsuit is being considered to expand Nintendo and promoters for Justin Timberlake because Justin Timberlake's tickets were involved in this concert, too.
1551559	1552960	They were in the contest, too.
1552980	1554040	They were a consolation prize.
1554421	1559643	And now it's kind of, well, now we're kind of roping it back into gaming because Nintendo could get sued over this whole thing.
1560824	1561564	Which is stupid.
1562563	1563343	It's really stupid.
1563363	1564423	They had nothing to do with it.
1564503	1565544	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
1565604	1575325	I mean, unless they can prove that Nintendo somehow sponsored this contest, which I doubt, I highly, highly, highly doubt they would sponsor a contest called Hold Your Wii for a Wii.
1575565	1577125	They would have never done that, okay?
1577446	1584887	So unless they can somehow prove that Nintendo sponsored this contest, I don't see that really happening, that they're going to be able to sue them.
1584987	1586867	But maybe that's what they're exploring right now.
1586887	1587147	I don't know.
1587167	1591908	That's what the lawyer would like to do because Nintendo is a large company and he thinks that he can get money from them, so...
1592594	1598177	And although I can understand where her family is coming from, I mean, it was very tragic what happened to her, although I do believe she is partially to blame, I felt...
1616588	1619630	She was more to blame until I heard the audio of the whole thing.
1619750	1626494	When I heard how crass the DJs were in talking about, you know, well, they signed waivers, what's the worst they've had, and the fact that people had called them.
1626794	1632837	I had a co-worker who listened to it, and she was telling me at work about how the one doctor we all heard about was not the only one to call in.
1632897	1638060	She said at least two doctors called in telling them not to do it, and they still continue to do it anyway.
1638340	1642343	So while, yeah, I kind of fault her for participating, I think there's blame.
1642663	1643763	It's just tragic.
1643843	1644684	The whole thing's tragic.
1645487	1646448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1665339	1667381	Now, she deserves her Darwin Award.
1667681	1676268	The DJs also, I think, were responsible for not thinking it through, for being pretty much, yeah, they were idiots.
1676288	1678450	They also deserve to be Darwinized.
1678530	1679971	Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.
1680772	1686216	But I don't think in kinda and sorta, I believe in every party was at fault.
1686817	1687557	She was at fault.
1687717	1688398	She deserves it.
1689022	1689682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1708347	1715309	And then they probably didn't know that it was, you know, I mean, because it's basically, okay, who can hold it the longest before they have to go.
1715869	1716649	That wasn't the issue.
1716689	1719950	It wasn't because she held back her urine that she died.
1719970	1723831	It's because she drank, like, gallons and gallons of water really quick.
1724451	1728653	And it wouldn't have mattered even if she went afterwards, because I'm assuming she did go afterwards.
1729033	1730153	The damage was already done.
1730626	1733427	The thing is, now they had them fill out waivers.
1733467	1737309	Well, they have generic waivers at the radio stations to have people fill out for their contests.
1737369	1740270	It's basically saying, oh, we don't hold you liable for this and this.
1740510	1754717	But they didn't disclose, at least it seems like from what I've heard on the radio and stuff, the recordings of it, they didn't really disclose what possible dangers were and say you might die from this if there's too much or something like that.
1755877	1760199	And I don't think they did the research, or if they did, they just completely shrugged it off
1760842	1762583	And that's really what the issue is.
1762643	1764964	It's not a matter of, you know, if they signed waivers or not.
1764984	1769767	It's just they didn't disclose the possible risks, you know, of participating in this activity.
1769787	1774370	Because not everyone, you know, is aware that, you know, drinking that much water could cause you to die.
1774770	1777632	You would just think that you'd just have to really go to the bathroom really bad.
1778873	1784656	So with a lot of these people not knowing, I mean, you can't really hold them responsible for that.
1784856	1786277	Granted, it's a stupid thing, but hey.
1786997	1787478	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1804601	1808104	I thought they said that she stopped when she did feel sick.
1808784	1811526	She did quit the contest.
1811847	1814569	Like when I read about it, I didn't know about water poisoning.
1814709	1816630	I was like, okay, that's crazy.
1816790	1818511	How could you not know about it?
1819152	1821534	You can drink so much water that it kills you.
1821574	1823095	I mean, you're pretty much saturating.
1823115	1828879	But being a radio contest, I thought they would have taken the precautions to warn the contestants and stuff.
1829643	1831587	or at least have somebody on hand.
1832007	1835733	I'm not saying at all that the DJs in the station were not at fault.
1836214	1837897	I'm saying that there's equal fault.
1838835	1844576	And, I mean, maybe everybody doesn't know that you can, you know, drink yourself of water to death.
1844696	1845736	I thought it was common sense.
1846256	1847537	Interesting perspective in the chat room.
1847557	1851137	Mike W. says, DarkSakura, it's not the DJ's fault for doing what his boss told him.
1851577	1854658	I do agree to an extent, and that's why ten people were fired over this.
1854698	1857759	You know, that's why, you know, certainly a lot of people, not just the DJs, were fired.
1857839	1865400	But I'm telling you, if you listen to the audio, which is available on one of our local newspapers, SACB.com has audio of the whole thing.
1865880	1871741	My whole point is that anything that's going to affect the body, you really, really need to understand what the risks are before you decide to do it.
1895131	1895791	That's my point.
1896651	1900012	And it came out more harshly than I intended it to.
1900772	1908433	But I think, and I'm not saying anyone deserves to die, but I'm saying that if you die of your own ignorance, then that is on you.
1908473	1908833	I'm sorry.
1909453	1915314	But they did have, and I think that they should have been more than fired.
1915354	1917175	I think they really need to stand trial for it.
1917695	1924516	But I think that those that were in charge of the contest, they had a duty to make sure that the risks were put out there.
1925770	1929473	I guess for the people who don't have common knowledge of this.
1930014	1930274	All right.
1930314	1932236	Well, we could talk for hours and hours about this.
1932276	1933417	Hell, we did on Wednesday's show.
1933457	1934998	We talked for at least an hour about this.
1935078	1938401	But in the interest of getting to more news, I'm directly involved with gaming.
1938441	1939301	We do want to move on.
1939702	1942644	We do welcome your emails and voicemails on this topic.
1942684	1947468	But please keep in mind, since this is a controversial issue, we're probably not going to get to read everything we get on it.
1948048	1949129	But we do welcome your thoughts.
1949249	1952292	Mailbag at OrangeLaundry.com or our voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1955214	1959577	Let's move on and talk about some news that is definitely directly about gaming.
1959617	1960658	Who's got something for us?
1961198	1961538	I do.
1962219	1963640	We're going to talk about some dates here.
1964420	1969203	Had a lot piling up actually the last two weeks and even some stuff we announced on the site a little bit.
1969924	1972125	But yet no one seems to be picking up on that.
1972686	1977989	Lots of stuff being announced this week, especially on all the big sites.
1978269	1980771	They were announcing a crazy taxi for the PSP.
1981772	1982592	Not a big surprise.
1982692	1983413	That's coming June 13th.
1984892	1997038	Some other stuff, Two Worlds, the PS3 version I guess is being delayed to October 10th and then the Xbox 360 one will be coming out in May on the 16th.
1997938	1999819	So that's some stuff that we probably already knew about.
2000360	2005482	However, there are a lot of things that many people haven't heard about yet and some stuff that's a little bit surprising.
2006763	2009464	First off here, we've got...
2010393	2015895	Let's see, a bunch of no-brainer titles, like a new bunch of movie-based stuff.
2016956	2027681	Ratatouille for pretty much every system out there except for the original Xbox to tie in with the upcoming Pixar movie.
2028421	2035004	And, of course, we've got Surf's Up also tying with the new movie coming out, and that's coming out in May.
2036205	2036965	What's interesting, though,
2037912	2043615	and beyond all that stuff, and like Spider-Man 3 and Transformers and Shrek the Third.
2044175	2047197	We do have some interesting stuff like Dog Island.
2047777	2052319	I don't know if you remember when they were first showing off the Wii stuff in Japan.
2052759	2063805	I thought it was a Hudson game, but it's basically that character, the dog, where they have the giant heads, kind of almost like, I don't know, some sort of toy thing over there.
2064489	2068690	That's coming out on the PlayStation 2 and the Wii May 23rd, which is kind of interesting.
2069530	2070550	Some bigger stuff, though.
2070630	2073151	Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Tales.
2073531	2076372	That's going to be coming out on the DS April 25th.
2076772	2079873	Dawn of Mana, finally making its way out to the PlayStation 2.
2079933	2081633	That's May 15th.
2083153	2088815	And then, of course, Guitar Hero 2 for the 360 is going to be coming out at the end of March on the 28th.
2089755	2090475	That's pretty big.
2091408	2112790	and then, um, some other interesting stuff, MotorStorm, MLB07 The Show, and God of War 2 have all been delayed a month, um, to March 14th now, so that's kind of interesting, uh, same with Fear also got delayed to that time, and then, of course, the big one that we announced on the site, uh, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic has been announced for the Xbox 360, and, um,
2115936	2123358	I know that was something that was being rumored to have happened ever since, actually before the 360 even came out, so it's kind of interesting there.
2125478	2136601	And let's see, and then, you know, other interesting stuff, Samurai Slash, which would be Samurai Warriors, the Koei game, coming to the Wii, and that's going to be May 16th.
2137521	2141462	Fatal Inertia, Bladestorm, also coming out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, April 18th.
2145483	2151688	which, you know, Koei actually came out and officially said summer, but April 18th is more accurate.
2152088	2152849	Kane and Lynch.
2152929	2160615	Now this one I'm kind of, you know, shaking my head with because I thought it was PlayStation 3 and the 360, but we have an announcement for PlayStation 2 and the 360.
2160735	2164117	So I don't know, but that's interesting.
2164838	2166099	June 20th for that one.
2167980	2171683	And then that's probably all the big stuff I'd say.
2172284	2173004	Just lots of dates.
2173024	2177465	We won't post more in that Under the Radar thread, though, if you want to check out the details there.
2177485	2179325	You should be posting some of that to the front page, really.
2179905	2182406	I have not heard of God of War being pushed back.
2182446	2183106	That's news to me.
2183426	2185466	Of course, I haven't been following for that story very closely.
2185747	2186707	This one's kind of cool, too.
2186827	2188527	Senko no Rondo for the 360.
2188567	2194568	That's an Ikaruga-style shooter that's coming out on May 16th as well.
2196048	2197709	So, yeah, lots of big stuff.
2198869	2199149	All right.
2199892	2200773	Well, thanks for the insight.
2200813	2202814	How about some, what's coming out next week?
2203055	2203795	Yeah, not much.
2204056	2205557	But yeah, I figured as much.
2205897	2207458	Not much of anything, actually.
2208920	2211802	Next week is a bunch of portable games, and that's pretty much it.
2212923	2213423	Let's see here.
2214024	2218127	I know we've got the, was it Hotel 219?
2218848	2218127	213.
2218868	2221230	213, my mistake.
2222231	2224473	That's going to be coming out on the DS.
2225194	2228216	Megalotov, you've been talking to me about this game a lot today.
2228236	2229456	Why are you so excited about it?
2229636	2235439	It's by the people that do Trace Memory, and I love Trace Memory for the two hours that you get to play it for.
2236340	2239882	And it's just like a film noir looking... Oh, it's 2.15.
2241582	2247745	It's just like a film noir thing where you're like some detective guy, and you hold your DS book style.
2248086	2248666	Like brain training?
2248926	2251427	Yeah, and it's just an adventure game.

2334268	2338131	Speaking of UK, you know our opening story, the controversial one this evening.
2338811	2340312	You know how I knew that was big news?
2340732	2342153	When I saw it on BBC News.
2342594	2344055	That's when I was like, wow.
2345396	2352620	If you didn't know about the don't drink water and don't go to the bathroom thing before, you sure as hell will now.
2352680	2353681	Everybody in the world will know it.
2353841	2354802	It's something else.
2355442	2356763	Common sense, people.
2357096	2357656	DarkSakura.com
2376011	2380917	Such as The Godfather, which is now making its way over to Japan on Xbox 360 on January 25th.
2381298	2387065	Also coming out The Idolmaster on 360 and Vampire's Reign from AQ Interactive.
2387563	2388263	WWE Smackdown vs. Raw
2416500	2420904	Final Fantasy X International, Final Fantasy XII International
2442159	2442619	Thanks for watching!
2449969	2452291	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2474465	2476627	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2494721	2500186	and P-Cross DS comes out from Nintendo itself over on the Nintendo DS.
2500326	2506991	Also another game coming out from Nintendo, Wish Room, Tenshi no Kyoku, coming out this week in Japan.
2508112	2509873	Is that just the hotel game localized over there?
2509973	2511054	Oh, great.
2511194	2512095	And this is pretty cool.
2512375	2513396	DarkSakura, you'll like this.
2513456	2516378	Coming out on the PSP, Parodius Portable.
2516946	2518286	Make this way to the PSP.
2518346	2520547	I know you're a big fan of Parodius.
2520607	2522367	Wasn't that the Parodius collection or something?
2522428	2523288	I believe it is.
2523528	2526008	I love Parodius.
2526609	2528369	Also, the Salamander collection.
2528629	2530650	Salamander Portable is coming out this week as well.
2530990	2533511	We were just talking about Salamander and Life Force this morning.
2533591	2537312	And Gradius moves into the best, so a big week if you're a Gradius fan over in Japan.
2537592	2539792	So while it may be a slow week here in the U.S.
2539872	2542773	and U.K., it's a busy week over there in Japan.
2542893	2546294	I'd like to mention, though, this week they did announce
2546650	2548392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2568532	2570813	Shadow Charlie seems to enjoy Parodius as well.
2571353	2574774	Parodius has some badass music, says Shadow Charlie.
2575254	2578275	And Shadow Charlie also wants to know, is DDR Universe out yet?
2578335	2579455	And the answer is no.
2579855	2583596	So those that were thinking it's coming out in January, looks like it really was March.
2583696	2585816	After all, Loki wins again.
2587677	2592218	Well, we have a little bit more on use as far as things that are going to be playable this year.
2593007	2595549	The Final Fantasy XIII demo is due out.
2595929	2598151	They said ready for E3 in 2007.
2601513	2610899	I'm not sure which one I guess they mean, because given that there's multiple Final Fantasy XIII going on, two of them going on with Squeenix.
2614261	2616563	I'm not sure if they mean both or just one or the other of them.
2616889	2618650	They should do 13 versions of that.
2619470	2620210	That would make sense.
2621271	2622251	They probably will, eventually.
2622271	2623191	That would make me cry.
2624272	2627153	We've already got, what, 13 versions of Final Fantasy VII, practically.
2627373	2628373	I don't even feel like counting.
2629594	2633315	Or 13 versions of Final Fantasy I, as we're going to find out later in the program.
2634596	2640558	But at any rate, the two are going to... I love Latin.
2640638	2642098	Fabula Nova Crystallis.
2642138	2643059	That just sounds cool.
2643219	2645040	The new Tale of the Crystal.
2645860	2646240	Pretty cool.
2647079	2654046	Kind of interesting, especially when folks are saying that the PlayStation 3 really needs its big title right now.
2654106	2658711	So it's kind of interesting how this Final Fantasy XIII news is kind of slowly leaking out, right?
2659392	2660473	Well, you know what they need?
2660513	2662856	It's just like Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation.
2662916	2664617	I mean, hell, I bought that system for that game.
2664637	2665058	That's true.
2665198	2667360	I did not buy a PlayStation until Final Fantasy VII.
2667520	2667981	And you know what?
2668301	2668962	I have to admit.
2669520	2679023	Final Fantasy XIII, especially depending on this demo, you know, after I play the demo, will probably be the thing that finally breaks me to get a PlayStation 3, because I'm the only OLR host that doesn't own one.
2680924	2681564	But I'm poor.
2682384	2685665	Anyways, so more on Final Fantasy XIII.
2685745	2688206	It's been leaked out by Famitsu and Dengeki.
2689307	2697069	Some stuff they're talking about, I guess, from the playable demo, including apparently it's going to have a really awesome opening scene.
2697349	2698430	It says probably the most...
2699855	2701857	I guess that means his penis is going to be huge too.
2728743	2729223	But whatever.
2729744	2735388	So hopefully we'll get some more important information on Final Fantasy XIII coming soon.
2735828	2736849	Other than shoe sizes.
2738170	2739031	We need bus sizes.
2739071	2739651	That's what we need.
2740392	2741312	Where's that information?
2742033	2745295	Well, I'm definitely looking forward to more and more information on Final Fantasy XIII.
2745636	2752120	Being the self-confessed Final Fantasy fanboy I am, I'm personally very excited for all the latest.
2752481	2754282	So we'll see hopefully more in the next few weeks.
2755905	2758526	More things that Japan is seeing is apparently PlayStation 3.
2758946	2763648	Sony put out a release this week that says they have sold one million of the machines.
2763788	2764148	I'm sorry.
2764569	2764909	I'm sorry.
2764989	2765169	Wait.
2765329	2765949	Key difference here.
2765969	2768911	They have shipped one million machines in Japan.
2769111	2770171	Sorry there.
2770411	2771872	See, I almost fell for the trick there.
2771952	2774674	I am so tired of these fucking companies doing this shit.
2774754	2775694	Oh, we've shipped them.
2776094	2776755	Good for you.
2776855	2778095	I've taken a shit, too.
2778155	2779636	I mean, do you want news on that, too?
2780076	2781717	I mean, seriously, I can...
2782466	2783786	So you shipped that many.
2783807	2787788	Why don't they say they've manufactured that many or thought about manufacturing that many?
2787948	2793970	It should be interesting to note that Sony only actually sold about 470,000 at the end of 2006.
2794150	2796251	That was their year's end sale figure.
2796311	2798912	So it's kind of interesting that this release comes out now.
2798932	2800772	It says, oh, we've actually shipped a million.
2801152	2802573	So does that mean that half of them are shitting?
2803013	2803293	Shitting?
2804153	2805454	Sitting on shelves?
2805754	2807155	They're shitting on the seashore.
2807975	2808435	I've got like...
2809382	2811044	I got dyslexia of the mouth today.
2811084	2811604	I don't know what it is.
2811624	2813766	I'm combining words that don't need to be combined.
2813786	2814866	I don't know what's wrong today.
2814926	2815847	I apologize, folks.
2816908	2818749	Amateur radio at its finest.
2819790	2821331	Maybe this is why we don't get paid to do what we do.
2823493	2834441	Should you have half a million of them sitting on the store shelves, or have they moved a whole bunch in the last two weeks that they've now shipped more to compensate for that?
2834561	2835362	I don't really know.
2835422	2838404	You have to understand, they've shipped more units to the stores.
2839454	2851996	to allow for more elaborate towers to be made out of the units that no one's buying, including castles and the traditional Christmas tree tower type thing.
2852546	2865336	Alright, well, it should be noted that now they have achieved their goal of shipping 2 million units worldwide about two weeks late from the deadline, but keep in mind that was a goal that got smaller and smaller before the PS3's release.
2865356	2867398	Wasn't their goal to sell that many units?
2867598	2867978	I don't know.
2868639	2871941	So now they're saying 6 million at the end of March they will ship.
2873543	2879447	I'm glad to see that they were able to hit their twice-adjusted goal two weeks late.
2880028	2880828	Way to go, Sony.
2881569	2881589	I
2882236	2884118	Hey, look, I don't write it, I just report on it.
2884158	2884618	There you go.
2885459	2886560	I don't know what else to tell you.
2887320	2888421	I know what else to tell people.
2888441	2888781	What's that?
2889502	2896988	Apparently, it's been listed that the PlayStation 3 is going to be more expensive in Ireland, and I don't know why.
2899350	2907217	It was actually listed on This Is Living that the price of the PlayStation 3 in Ireland is going to be...
2908315	2912958	629.99 euros instead of the announced 5.99.
2915219	2930448	This is actually, the speculation is that it actually is going to be an increase all over Europe, but just that Ireland got the update first, so I really hope that it's
2931448	2935913	Not true, you know, that they keep it the $5.99 because that's going to piss off a lot of people.
2936154	2940058	I heard it was because the higher VAT prices in Ireland.
2940419	2946706	Now, Seisha is one of our UK listeners, and he's in chat right now saying it's not just Ireland, but the entirety of the UK as well.
2947366	2947547	So...
2948211	2949272	Has Sony released?
2949552	2955595	Because we read that to be that it was just Ireland, but maybe something's changed since that published.
2956535	2958356	Maybe if all their VAT prices went up, I don't know.
2958396	2960517	Well, has Sony even officially confirmed anything?
2960577	2964179	Because we still don't have a firm date for the UK, do we?
2964539	2966520	They've confirmed non-confirmation.
2967621	2971002	So does this mean we don't really know anything, or what's it boiled down to?
2971683	2973784	It means that their shipping units...
2976098	2977718	Some day, some amount.
2977939	2985321	Actually, there is an update, a posted update, that that's exactly why it did increase.
2985681	2995443	For the rest of everybody else, it's going to be $5.99 for the $60 and $4.25 for the... Damn you, Ireland, setting the bar for everyone else.
2996363	2997104	Just buy the $20.
2997264	2997964	You really don't need the $60.
2998644	2998824	Really?
2998924	2999804	I have the $60.
2999924	3001345	I like it, but I use my HDMI.
3003700	3005241	So is HDMI that important?
3005261	3005761	What do you guys think?
3006081	3007022	It's on both units.
3007822	3010243	I thought that was a big thing that it wasn't going to be on the 20 gig.
3010263	3011223	Yeah, then they changed that.
3011604	3011864	Really?
3012024	3013044	Yeah, it's on both units.
3013064	3013785	I didn't get that memo.
3014045	3015045	It's still stupid.
3015065	3016286	I have the 60 and I like it.
3016586	3016886	We'll see.
3017166	3017466	I don't know.
3018286	3019547	I'm running out of room on the 360 with the 20 gig.
3019567	3020547	Well, you can always upgrade.
3020667	3020888	We'll see.
3024699	3029702	Of course, those hard drives, the 2.5 inch SATA drives are fucking expensive, but whatever.
3029882	3031222	I haven't made a decision on what I want to do yet.
3031483	3032503	I'm too poor, I know that much.
3032523	3040067	But you know, one reason you might want to upgrade that 2.5 inch SATA drive in your PS3 is to run Myth TV on it.
3040547	3049011	Because if you install the second operating system or Linux on your other partition, there is actually a way now to get Myth TV to run.
3049912	3051973	Using a USB TV tuner,
3052842	3056003	and a wonderful set of homemade drivers for it.
3056824	3066047	You too can run the wonderful TVR software to be able to record your favorite shows and dump them onto your hopefully larger hard drive.
3066968	3067708	So that's pretty cool.
3069249	3071410	And I don't know.
3072010	3077692	I might try that since I don't really have room on my other drive, although I need to get a capture card for that.
3077792	3079573	But hey, that's great.
3080558	3086262	Well, from one TV-enabled system to another, let's go over to Microsoft IPTV.
3086322	3090585	Of course, this was announced at CES, and details are starting to fill in.
3090865	3095888	I have a lengthy quote here from the Microsoft TV site of what exactly this thing does.
3096349	3107016	Quote, Microsoft TV IPTV Edition is an integrated and comprehensive software platform developed specifically to deliver broadcast quality video and new integrated TV services over broadband networks.
3107396	3107857	and many more.
3133158	3138006	and for cable operators looking to deliver differentiated TV services and experiences.
3145126	3149689	Download it or just plug on to your Xbox 360 and boom, you get TV through your 360.
3149810	3150410	Oh, no, no, no, no.
3150730	3157555	You're going to have to switch up your cable provider who therefore will also provide your internet and so on and so on.
3157635	3165842	You're really going to have to make an adjustment change when it comes to how your services such as internet and TV are provided in your house.
3166642	3172386	If people are thinking, oh, this is just some cool little enhancement of 360, it's a little more than that.
3173327	3174408	It kind of makes me think like
3175886	3180588	Almost like Microsoft is now becoming a rival to Satellite in a way.
3180668	3180968	I don't know.
3181028	3182108	Maybe that's a little bit far-fetched.
3182148	3184209	Not the best way to phrase it, but I don't know.
3184229	3184830	What do you guys think?
3184850	3187310	Is this something you might be interested in checking out?
3187571	3188731	I would check it out, definitely.
3188871	3189771	Would you make that change?
3189811	3191032	Would you get rid of what you have now for this?
3191832	3192372	What I have?
3192392	3194533	Yeah, because cable's fucking too expensive.
3195013	3197654	If it had some good programming on it, hell yeah.
3198275	3202096	If it had everything, although I imagine IPTV doesn't probably have everything.
3202416	3204437	Yeah, it might have some specific channels, you know.
3205720	3206020	I don't know.
3206540	3213643	If anything, it would be a good addition to, if not, replacing my current TV.
3214183	3216584	Although my current TV is expensive, and I hate it.
3218084	3220885	I'm looking at some comments from chatroom, chat.orangelunchradio.com.
3221185	3224026	Blackboy says, basically the 360 becomes a cable box.
3224346	3225646	I guess that's kind of one way you can think of it.
3226247	3227687	I think it's a waste.
3229078	3237125	Well, you know, again, this is Microsoft doing the Trojan horse thing, and they've openly admitted that they did not put out the 360 to do just gaming.
3237745	3243170	So, you know, and now it's down to, you know, it sounds to me like cable versus satellite versus the 360.
3243590	3246713	Or you can do what I do, and that's not watch TV and get a life.
3247748	3251071	But even there, you watch Doctor Who, you watch something.
3251091	3254934	I download it off the internet, watch it at my convenience, and then go outside.
3255034	3257376	So there is some television you watch, at least one thing.
3257396	3258577	But I don't use my television anymore.
3258597	3259518	And Torchwood, you watch that too.
3259558	3260298	I don't need cable.
3261259	3267584	But you could, with the IPTV, you could set it, now granted you don't live in the UK, if there were any US shows that you watched, I mean I know they rebroadcast.
3267604	3268245	Heroes starts tomorrow.
3268265	3272108	There's nothing at all worth watching on television in the United States.
3272128	3273890	Are you going to watch Heroes tomorrow with Doctor Nine?
3275091	3276672	Probably not actually, I'm going to be in school.
3278260	3279361	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3305999	3306339	Whatever.
3306599	3306859	All right.
3307079	3316322	I think if I got anything for TV, I'd definitely have a DVR, but other than that... Yeah, and then that's kind of what IPTV is, you know, DVR, video on demand, all that crap.
3316502	3322023	And I just don't think that... I don't think that we need anything else contributing to the couch potato mentality.
3322243	3324484	But there are... And there's educational things on TV.
3324504	3331746	Heck, over at Loki's last night, we were watching on Discovery Health this whole special on people going through transgender surgery, and there was this post-op chick...
3332432	3333932	JV Mon in chat says, IPTV seems unattractive to me.
3333952	3335733	I feel like I don't know enough about it yet.
3335773	3335853	Like,
3354964	3359008	I realize CES is kind of a very high-level thing for tech heads and things of that nature.
3359168	3367215	I need a brochure that's dumbed down for me to explain exactly what I'm going to have to change and what I'm going to have to pay to get this and why I should do it.
3367495	3369457	But again, for me, it comes down to the channels.
3369677	3377944	If it had some pretty good HD channels, because that's what my current cable provider is severely lacking, is we have like five HD channels, and there's way more out there.
3378365	3381027	I know there's others out there, and HD is pretty good.
3381869	3383830	Raven's Dolphin agrees with the YouTube thing.
3383890	3384771	Long live YouTube.
3385931	3386352	There you go.
3389093	3389673	Moving on.
3391675	3396777	We watched YouTube last night on the Wii.
3398118	3398778	Laser Cats.
3399659	3402801	We were watching Jesus Christ Supercop today on the Wii.
3403801	3404782	They were watching some...
3405801	3406362	DarkSakura.com
3424821	3434984	The assault rifle in Halo 3 is the MA-5C assault rifle that is a return of one that they removed from Halo 2.
3435224	3435924	They didn't have in Halo 2.
3437165	3442826	The power level is going to be somewhere between the original one and the BR-55 battle rifle from Halo 2.
3443927	3446788	You can use the butt as a melee weapon apart from that.
3447268	3454450	Just a thing that I thought was very funny is how they described it was the MA-5C is built like a brick outhouse with Venetian blinds.
3455168	3456028	DarkSakura.com
3485157	3489959	But then I remembered there are those cutesy games that you are into that none of the rest of us have freaking heard of.
3490039	3491540	So I guess there's that.
3492100	3496481	Halo really isn't, you know, the Halo franchise really isn't that bad.
3497242	3500763	It's just that it's not my thing, you know.
3501503	3505525	Now that's understandable because certainly I know a lot of people who aren't into Halo, which is another thing.
3505565	3507606	But me, I've been getting back into Halo too lately.
3507646	3508826	I did try.
3509747	3512928	You know, if somebody I know is into a game...
3513610	3516851	I think that it's worth playing once before I reserve my judgment for it.
3517831	3529934	But I have the same problem with that that I found out a long time ago that I have with Goldeneye, with almost any first-person shooter, that it makes me so motion sick that I can't... Katamari makes me motion sick.
3530334	3535415	However, it's on crack and has enough in it that makes me be able to stand playing a couple of games.
3535435	3536435	Okay.
3537216	3537596	Fair enough.
3537856	3542997	Can you imagine how insane Katamari would be if the Sonic team was behind it?
3544520	3545581	That'd be like super fast.
3545661	3546941	No, because they'd fuck it up.
3547101	3549182	Oh, that's right, you wouldn't be able to control it correctly.
3549283	3550003	Exactly.
3550123	3551184	No, no, no, no, no.
3551784	3554085	I think that Sonic Team needs to, never mind.
3554205	3556366	The Sonic Team debate will go for another show.
3557227	3571134	Anywho, as if it's a huge surprise or anything, because I know it's not for me, the Halo 3 beta, since it's being included in Crackdown, well, they've sold about another 25% more of Crackdown than they would have normally had.
3571653	3573254	Yeah, big surprise there.
3573334	3576717	People aren't going to buy Crackdown just because of the Halo 3 beta in there.
3577698	3579499	To be honest, though, Crackdown's an awesome game.
3579719	3581020	The demo's coming out on Tuesday.
3581561	3584023	So I highly recommend checking it out if you have Xbox Live.
3584763	3585524	Definitely worth it.
3588786	3596172	Well, as Loki previously reported, Major Nelson confirmed that Crackdown demo will be hitting Xbox Live on Tuesday.
3596412	3596673	Sorry.
3596733	3599195	And Loki gets a big finger from me for stealing my story.
3599235	3599655	Thanks a lot.
3600273	3602575	Check it out, Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.
3603055	3607780	But I guess I could take this opportunity to point out, he doesn't often announce demos in advance.
3608200	3614906	So usually they announce them once they've already hit, or news leaks out, and most Microsoft rumors are true anyway.
3615246	3616287	So, I don't know.
3617288	3624454	But regardless, since I don't know much about Crackdown, but I keep hearing Loki rave about it, which is fascinating because he's never played it, I definitely want to check out the demo.
3624474	3627597	It's like Grand Theft Auto, but here's why Crackdown's awesome.
3628442	3629723	Can you sleep with a hooker then shoot them?
3652065	3653166	I don't know if you can sleep with hookers.
3653266	3653986	Not interested.
3654247	3657129	But you can probably throw hookers into buildings and that's just as cool.
3657369	3658830	Okay, now my interest is back.
3658850	3659130	We'll see.
3659531	3662633	And it's got two-player co-op over live.
3663333	3663874	Okay, alright.
3663894	3664574	See, that would be fun.
3664714	3668297	I will check out the demo just for you, Loki, and give my thoughts on next week's edition.
3668317	3668938	It's got multiplayer co-op.
3668998	3669858	We'll play multiplayer.
3671159	3672400	Alright, will the demo have multiplayer?
3672420	3672600	Yes.
3673041	3673581	Oh, sweet.
3674362	3675042	I'm all about that.
3675102	3676223	Can I throw you into a building?
3676243	3677684	Because I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
3677824	3678124	Maybe.
3678305	3678805	Alright.
3679425	3679966	Sign me up.
3680426	3681547	I should pre-order it tomorrow.
3682008	3684110	Then I can be in the Halo 3 beta like all the cool kids.
3686152	3689074	You can be in the cool kids club for lots of other things, Rob.
3689835	3690155	Like what?
3691456	3697001	Like your idea for getting fast passes while we were in the line for Space Mountain.
3697322	3698202	So we could ride it again?
3698222	3699023	So we could ride it again.
3699343	3701866	And then getting fast passes for when we go back for my birthday.
3702386	3702927	I'm smart.
3703067	3703767	I'm smart like that.
3704148	3706530	Well, here's some cool stuff.
3707791	3716695	For anyone who is into Luminous Live, there will be three goodies coming out on Wednesday.
3719116	3725918	It's actually three downloadable packages that are going to be available January 24th at 1 a.m.
3725978	3727099	Pacific time.
3728719	3735482	Two of them are add-on packs, and then there's one for free, but only for Xbox Live Gold members.
3736087	3737467	Now it would be the Heavenly Star Pack.
3737807	3744329	Yes, which I am so... You know, I would get Luminous Live just to get the Heavenly Star Pack.
3744489	3752072	Yes, and this gives me another excuse to play this song on our little program here, a little clip from it, because I freaking love this song, and I think it's going to be awesome to play.
3752272	3753512	It's your fault I put it on my mic, Dave.
3764204	3769408	Oh, somebody in chat is saying there's new Alpha Canogram says I want the new Genki Rockets remixes on iTunes.
3769488	3769688	What?
3769748	3769948	What?
3770449	3771209	I have iTunes open right now.
3771229	3772010	I'm going to look at that crap.
3773090	3773851	Rob, show.
3774131	3775852	I do not see remixes on iTunes.
3775872	3776853	This is lies.
3777474	3777854	Lies.
3778154	3779475	Maybe they're in the UK store or something.
3779495	3779755	I don't know.
3780776	3781076	All right.
3781316	3781536	Sorry.
3781576	3781817	Show.
3782517	3784759	I did want to go back and read some chat comments, some other things in chat.
3785948	3795040	JeremyTodd1 was saying about the Crackdown demo, Loki, some people who have played it were saying it's more like Spider-Man 2 or that Hulk Ultimate Destruction game more than GTA.
3796142	3796302	So...
3796809	3799050	and Blaze says this is how the demo is going to go down.
3799390	3800530	Loki kills everything.
3800810	3802070	Rob goes and picks a flower.
3802170	3803211	Look, screw you, buddy.
3803391	3803691	Okay?
3803911	3804351	Look, no.
3805131	3805271	No.
3805671	3815014	When I played the Superman Returns demo, which the only thing I got a thrill out of in that demo was I went and I picked up a woman and then I flew to the beach and left her and I was like, bye, bitch.
3815314	3816014	I flew away.
3816855	3820636	If you don't think I can be sadistic in those types of games, you are way wrong.
3820656	3822076	You got the wrong impression of me, buddy.
3822276	3823737	You missed the best part in the game, though.
3823757	3828059	You pick up a car, and you fly really high, because you can't really, you know, blow up the car.
3828299	3831381	You could drop the car, though, and it just falls and explodes.
3831921	3832201	Really?
3832621	3834282	I should re-download the demo just to do that.
3834422	3835023	It's hilarious.
3835043	3838684	I'm not going to buy the game, but I'll... Do you get achievements, maybe, for that?
3838725	3840345	Because maybe I could, like, gamefly it.
3840465	3842767	I need to get a gamefly account, or one of those companies.
3842787	3843447	I don't know if I'll go with them.
3843467	3844407	It's a horrible, horrible game.
3844447	3847349	But anyways, one game that's not so horrible, although...
3848260	3848940	Boom Boom Rocket
3878544	3880185	and hopefully it'll be downloadable soon.
3881965	3882505	So, I don't know.
3882585	3885206	It looks pretty cool from the screenshots I've seen of it so far.
3886787	3887647	It looks pretty sexy.
3887847	3888207	I don't know.
3889788	3891088	I heard it just looks like Fantavision.
3891748	3893069	Oh, there's actual screenshots of it now?
3893289	3896150	It looks just like Fantavision and kind of like DDR.
3896610	3898490	Oh, it does look kind of like DDR.
3898610	3899491	Oh, Jamie can't see.
3899511	3900431	Oh, that looks fun.
3901031	3901611	Show it to Jamie.
3901651	3902032	She can't see.
3903372	3904452	Oh, explodey.
3904872	3906313	Oh, Miklatov's excited about this?
3907362	3910964	I love Fantavision, I think I'm the only person in the world who got the biggest kick out of it.
3911004	3911825	I still have Fantavision.
3912025	3912725	It's the best.
3912905	3916908	It was the best launch title, and that looks just like it, and I can't wait now.
3917208	3933418	It really does look like DDR, because there's like this kind of a purple line towards the top of the screen, and there's actual, looks like the bursts from the fireworks going up, instead of maybe clicking on them or whatever, they have arrows on them, so I think you have to
3934608	3939912	Maybe point in the direction of the arrow or something, kind of like DDR, and it'll blow them up in time.
3940252	3940833	That's my guess.
3941193	3942053	JV Mon called it.
3942073	3943835	JV Mon said, that will make Miklatov happy.
3945096	3946777	You must talk to him a lot offline or something.
3948098	3948438	All right.
3948838	3951000	Well, before we get to the next story, I just want to point this out.
3951020	3953822	I wanted to do a quick follow-up here on the last story.
3954883	3963589	What I thought was interesting is that somebody pointed me to the MySpace for Genkai Rockets, who does Heavenly Star, and apparently it is announced on there that
3963945	3968450	that there will be five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.
3968490	3969170	And they have a clip.
3969190	3970071	I'm assuming this is one of them.
3973855	3975436	Tokyo Hot 100.
3975557	3977038	No, this is some radio clip.
3977058	3978139	This is number 27 on 81.3.
3978179	3979961	Genki Rockets, Heavenly Star.
3989188	3989789	Ah, forget it.
3989809	3991050	That's just some clip from the radio.
3991070	3992290	Why'd they put that on their MySpace?
3992531	3993351	Why would they put that?
3993371	3994592	Live radio, boys and girls.
3994632	3996474	Sorry, I didn't know what I was clicking on.
3996514	4000597	They do say on the MySpace, it's written here, five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.
4002338	4002618	I don't know.
4002638	4003219	Why what, Loki?
4003539	4006641	Why would they put that clip from a radio show?
4006681	4009343	Because they want to show that Genkai Rockets is awesome.
4009683	4012125	Well, why don't they put an MP3 copy of it or something?
4012145	4015308	You know, something that doesn't sound like recorded off radio.
4015468	4015588	Could...
4016511	4018193	Do you think we could get Genkai Rockets on the show?
4018213	4019254	Do you think they speak English?
4021077	4021417	Maybe.
4022458	4023580	I'm going to fire off an email.
4023620	4024841	I'm going to send them a message on MySpace.
4025201	4025942	They sing in English.
4026042	4026523	We'll see what happens.
4026963	4027544	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4028325	4028565	All right.
4029286	4029827	Well, anyway.
4032199	4032599	www.darksakura.com
4054935	4081327	Guitar Hero franchise is now moving over to the Neversoft branch who makes Tony Hawk's Project 8 and this is confirmed by a screenshot from Neversoft's website where you see Guitar Hero side by side with Tony Hawk's Project 8 so it does look like now Guitar Hero 3 will be developed by this Neversoft company so apparently now this frees up Harmonix to work on a rumored sequel to Frequency and Aplitude but as we learned about on a previous program
4082398	4087044	They were going to put one out on the PSP and it got, I guess, canned.
4087184	4088425	So I don't know what they're working on now.
4088445	4089307	It must be top secret.
4090308	4090628	Who knows?
4094173	4098138	Well, there is actually something interesting going on, though.
4098218	4099700	Activision registered trademarks.
4100828	4104691	for two new games, Guitar Villain and Drum Villain.
4105712	4116443	The applications are stating that they're both the same thing, computer game software, downloadable software for use in connection with computer games, entertainment services.
4118284	4122949	It seems to me that I think that they're really going to be expanding the franchise.
4125530	4133897	And both of those applications also said that they'd be using toy guitars for video games, toys designed to be used for computer games or video games.
4136199	4137320	The drum one sounds interesting.
4137360	4141864	I'm thinking, you know, sort of like what session mode was for Drum Mania.
4141904	4153013	But also, you know, we need to keep in mind, in April last year, Red Octane placed applications to trademark Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero.
4153713	4154014	So...
4155558	4156700	I haven't seen anything from those yet.
4157181	4158543	No, but it could be.
4158803	4169320	But it is interesting that, you know, Konami, who did the, you know, Bimani series, had a Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, and Keyboard Mania, so it's almost kind of...
4170137	4171698	Mirror Image.
4171798	4175940	They'll win their awards for Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero and Band Hero or whatever else.
4176581	4178942	It's so innovative.
4178962	4180283	I've never seen that before.
4180323	4181363	You know what?
4181683	4183624	Konami abandoned keyboard mania.
4183724	4186226	Therefore, I am all about bringing on the Keyboard Hero.
4186446	4186946	That's fine.
4186986	4187426	That's fine.
4187546	4189608	I want to play Jump.
4189688	4196011	If they can put Jump in Keyboard Hero, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
4196111	4197692	Tell me not everybody would want to play that.
4198830	4199831	Session Van Halen
4218072	4219153	Come out and try to say it's original.
4219493	4230741	But what's good about music games, though, the sales have been up about 80%, probably due to the fact of Guitar Hero 2 coming out, since it was, I think, one of the top-selling games in December.
4232022	4243991	Not a huge surprise, but a lot of people are starting to actually look at music games as possibly a way to get their music heard, including some quotes from...
4244912	4245713	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4266431	4268112	Not really that much innovation going on.
4268453	4278220	I will say as much as I love and adore Konami for bringing over Beatmania and DDR, I think this kind of proves they didn't put enough faith in it in the beginning.
4278721	4282364	And now that the games have taken off, other people are getting the credit for it in a way.
4282424	4292092	I mean, obviously the guitar game has been reinvented since then, but I think Konami might be kicking themselves a little bit for not taking a bigger risk and bringing more of those games over here a few years ago.
4292112	4293773	You know, I'm really surprised that
4294958	4299522	with Guitar Hero's success that they haven't jumped to try to bring drum here.
4300102	4300643	Give it time.
4300663	4301464	You never know what might happen.
4302164	4302484	I don't know.
4305227	4306188	We will see, I guess.
4306208	4312793	Yeah, supposedly they're having a big press conference pretty soon, Konami, and apparently we get to go, so we'll have all the latest for you.
4312953	4313674	Apparently.
4313714	4314094	Hopefully.
4315075	4316196	Hopefully we don't get turned down.
4316636	4323222	So we'll have all the latest for you guys here on this program when that happens, which is in a couple weeks.
4324515	4337043	Talkin' now about the Wii a little bit, because, you know, one reason that people play dance games is to lose weight, and one thing that has people excited about the Wii is it's got you up and movin' around, so can you really lose weight playing the Wii?
4337403	4340005	And, you know, my kind of reaction when I saw it was like, well, not a lot.
4340025	4341185	You're not doing that much motion.
4341205	4344387	You're not supposed to do these grand, huge motions.
4344407	4347409	You're only supposed to do little motions with your hand and all that stuff.
4347429	4352292	Well, this website did this Wii Sports Experiment thing,
4352992	4358635	and apparently what they've done here is that they did a 30 day trial of playing the game.
4359375	4365598	They ran, I think they played for 30 days for 30 minutes and the dude lost like 10 pounds.
4366018	4366978	Without changing any diet.
4366998	4367999	No, I'm sorry, it was six weeks.
4368219	4373401	He didn't change any diet or nothing and in 30 minutes of Wii Sports a day, he lost 10 pounds.
4374569	4377532	I would say that's just probably more a result of being more active in general.
4377712	4382136	Just kind of, you know, getting the body moving and waking up the muscles and things probably a little bit.
4382296	4382997	That's probably it.
4383037	4384678	I mean, it's just an increase in activity.
4385519	4389282	If anything, it would be, I would consider a low impact aerobic.
4390043	4391824	Yeah, which is, it's better than nothing.
4392245	4392425	Yeah.
4392545	4394667	So, you know, cool on that.
4395207	4397309	And that's probably something I need to go on because, you know.
4398154	4398854	I want to quit my gym.
4399075	4400535	I've gained a little weight lately.
4400595	4401216	I need to lose it.
4401316	4402816	So maybe I'll go on the weed diet as well.
4403217	4407479	Because, you know, WarioWare has kind of a mode in it that is encouraging the whole weight loss thing.
4407859	4413022	They have a mode that is nothing but games that require big movements.
4413602	4415803	So it's supposed to be a game that really gets you moving around.
4415823	4417024	And I just need to play more DDR.
4417064	4418104	I'm just going to go to the gym.
4418485	4419965	And I do need to just go to the gym.
4420045	4421726	But you know my thing with gyms.
4421746	4422507	Gyms are weird places.
4422527	4424548	You can come with me and Extra for on Tuesday.
4424728	4425348	I'll think about it.
4425989	4426569	We'll talk off air.
4427717	4428598	Maybe we'll have a play date.
4428618	4428938	We'll see.
4430239	4432581	Only if we get to... Never mind.
4432601	4436224	If we get to go out for ice cream afterwards.
4436304	4438146	Okay, let's get ice cream after the job.
4438386	4439127	That works for me.
4439247	4440628	That's the kind of reward I need.
4441169	4441469	All right.
4441569	4447494	Anyway, one reward we like to give our listeners is reading the stuff they have to write to us on air.
4448014	4450456	And tonight we have our lovely mailbag segment.
4450857	4455861	DarkSakura reads the emails that you send to her at mailbag at orangelaunceradio.com live here on the air.
4456192	4458734	and I believe we probably have an Uber mailbag segment tonight, don't we?
4458754	4459355	We probably have a lot.
4459475	4459815	I don't know.
4460235	4460756	Decent.
4461216	4463258	Once I got rid of the spam, we had a few.
4463418	4463678	All right.
4464038	4469082	Well, let's get to some emails because I know we probably missed a few while we were out and I want to hear what the folks had to say.
4469523	4471264	So, DarkSakura, who emailed us?
4472945	4475087	First email of the night was from Rini.
4476328	4477109	Salutations.
4477189	4479050	I love when an email starts with salutations.
4479070	4479731	That's just awesome.
4480532	4484735	Listen to your last two podcasts of 2006 and would like to respond to some items of interest.
4485410	4510614	on your Christmas Eve episode someone asked why iTunes keeps inexplicably stopping downloads as much as it pisses me off as well the only remedy I can offer to iTunes users when you're downloading a podcast make sure that not only is iTunes in the front most or active application but that you keep iTunes in its downloads feature up front as well you do this by starting a download in iTunes choosing downloads on the sidebar to the left of the iTunes window okay
4511723	4525707	Since iTunes is already being pissy enough as it is, if you end up with an incomplete podcast, delete the incomplete file, go onto the podcast section of iTunes and click on the Orange Dodge Radio item, the one with the gray iTunes window, click unsubscribe, and then click subscribe.
4526187	4533330	After you've recovered from doing all that, iTunes will have refreshed the list of all shows from the feed and immediately start downloading the latest show automatically.
4533410	4534610	You know what's also great about that?
4535151	4539274	The more people that click subscribe, the higher our ranking goes on iTunes.
4539834	4543037	Also, inadvertently helping the station out, so I love this tactic.
4543317	4544278	Kudos to Remy.
4545679	4550682	Regarding your end of the year show, I would like to say that Scott Rubin was quite pissed that he wasn't invited.
4551523	4551963	Rebuttal?
4552764	4554125	He would have been a great guest.
4555986	4563532	You know, Scott, I left the message on Scott's Xbox Live friends list, and he defriended me, so his loss.
4564955	4565636	No, I'm just kidding.
4567037	4582891	The reason we picked the people we did is we wanted to get a mix of people that we have on the show a lot, like Bobby, and people we hadn't had on the show before, but respected, like VGO and Gamertag Radio and those other things.
4583912	4586394	Scott knows he's welcome on the show anytime he wants.
4586434	4590658	So Scott, if you're still feeling butthurt about not being on the show, send us an email.
4590678	4591338	We'd love to have you on.
4591659	4591959	Anytime.
4592967	4600953	Lastly, I don't believe it was reported on OLR, but the classic CD-ROM trivia game You Don't Know Jack semi-returns in web form at YouDon'tKnowJack.com.
4601433	4604875	Currently, questions only come in the form of Dis or Dat minigames.
4605376	4609178	The best parts are that a new Dis or Dat is available daily holidays, too.
4609759	4614302	And one of the original hosts, I mean, Cookie?
4615203	4616083	Yeah, Cookie.
4617044	4619766	Curiously, the site is also in beta form.
4620643	4622764	Have a happy new year and keep on going, Rini.
4622784	4625006	Anyway, moving forward, we have one from AZHP.
4642185	4648170	Hey guys, all we're talking about Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, and the possibility of RS2 on 360.
4649471	4658718	Just having gotten Ikaruga as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, I wanted to know what other games has Treasure made, especially games that were on systems in the realm of virtual console games.
4659218	4663201	I have my Wii, and I'm an absolute VC game whore.
4663861	4667164	Not because I played the games in my youth, I'm 18 and in college.
4667506	4672390	but because my paltry $4 a week allowance didn't allow me to buy many $70 games in my youth.
4672910	4687301	That being said, Virtual Console is a haven for Shrump fans as I have Gunstar Heroes, Superstar Soldiers, Soldier Blade, and R-Type and love them all and I'm eagerly anticipating downloading Gradius as soon as I load up more points.
4687682	4692025	So basically, what treasure games are there that could possibly make their way to Virtual Console?
4692425	4693606	Eagerly awaiting an answer.
4694387	4695427	Sincerely, AZHP.
4695728	4697269	And I actually emailed back
4697944	4705168	with a list and give me a second and I will definitely pull up the list that I did.
4707209	4709910	Okay, here are the list of games that Treasure has made.
4711171	4713452	For Arcadius, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun.
4714065	4726854	Dreamcast was Bongayo, Ikaruga, Game Boy Advance was Advanced Guardian Heroes, Astro Boy Omega Factor, Gunstar Superheroes, Hajime no Ippo, The Fighting, Tiny Toon Adventures, Buster's Bad Dream, I just totally don't see that coming out on Virtual Console.
4727454	4743705	Game Boy Color was Tiny Toon Adventures, Dizzy's Candy Quest, Game Gear was Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, GameCube was Dragon Drive, D-Master Shot, Ikaruga, Wario World, Genesis Alien Soldier, Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, Light Crusader, McDonald's Treasureland Adventure, which I totally don't see coming on Virtual Console.
4744285	4747827	and Yu Yu Hakusho, Makyo, Toitsusen, sorry.
4748908	4751389	And then IQ, Sin and Punishment, Successor to the Earth.
4751630	4752950	Master System had Dynamite Headdy.
4753891	4755192	Nintendo 64 was Buckret.
4755292	4756393	This is a bunch that came out.
4756613	4758734	Basically, Mission Makers, Bangaio.
4758774	4759875	We had some Bleach games.
4761255	4763337	Rakugaki Showtime, Silhouette Mirage.
4764557	4766259	Basically, the games that I see coming out...
4767660	4777265	I think that if they start expanding past the 16-bit era, which I kind of hope that they do, we might start seeing some of the Saturn 2D ones out.
4777806	4780807	I would love to see Radiant Silvergun and Guardian Heroes and Silhouette Mirage coming out.
4780827	4783029	Do you really think we get Saturn games on Virtual Console?
4783409	4783549	Huh?
4783569	4785810	Do you really think we get Saturn games on Virtual Console?
4785830	4786390	I don't see why not.
4788612	4789452	Loki's shaking his head no.
4789572	4790753	The 2D ones, I don't see why not.
4790773	4791073	Too big.
4791193	4791653	I think too big.
4791913	4794535	Too big and the thing downloads as slow as shit as it is.
4795709	4798911	But I don't see why we wouldn't get some of the sprite-based ones.
4799051	4804834	Maybe on, I'm going to say it here and now, I bet you anything in the next three years, Nintendo announces a Wii HD.
4805014	4806015	Maybe on the Wii HD.
4806615	4810377	But I totally see us getting something like Mischief Makers.
4811038	4817481	I totally see, you know, Dynamite Headdy, a bunch of the other ones coming out.
4817561	4819402	I don't really see why not.
4819783	4823925	If it's not just for size, I think that it could definitely handle it.
4825515	4827036	GS68 makes a good point.
4827116	4831758	Soundtracks will raise the file size, because if it uses Redbook Audio, then that's... Why would it use Redbook Audio?
4832338	4832658	Did they?
4832718	4833058	I don't know.
4833119	4834439	Didn't some Saturn games use it?
4834479	4841062	Only some did, and then they started moving in toward the other... I can't remember off the top of my head.
4841682	4843283	Okay.
4843663	4845744	Some games you can fully put in and just listen to, but...
4846357	4847478	They started moving away from that.
4847638	4852841	DDR Second Mix, I remember, was just randomly some game I'm thinking of off the top of my head, like the PlayStation DDR game.
4853001	4853842	The first DDR, yeah.
4853882	4856523	Yeah, you could put it in a regular CD player and hear the songs.
4856583	4857204	It was a soundtrack.
4857704	4859345	Yeah.
4859885	4864088	A lot more games started moving past that, though, for compression.
4864108	4872773	I think that if they were able to get some sort of increased storage capability for the Wii, I think we could totally start seeing...
4875691	4878212	and other later generation system games.
4878993	4879633	I don't see why not.
4879673	4880834	I think it could fully handle it.
4881494	4881954	Well, we'll see.
4883735	4884255	Not this year.
4885336	4888157	I'm just glad to see that other people like Treasure, because I love Treasure.
4890459	4895761	Also, next email, we have one coming from Nike.
4896742	4898343	Hey, OLR, I'm here again.
4898683	4900784	Got quite a lot to say, but I'll try to keep it short.
4901591	4902472	What's an MMO?
4902632	4904433	Is it like a World of Warcraft style game?
4904553	4908115	MMO is Massively Multiplayer Online.
4909356	4912357	You mean MMORPG, Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplay Game.
4912878	4915879	MMO means Massively Multiplayer Online.
4916139	4920622	Which basically means you're playing with hundreds of people or thousands of people at once instead of just two or three.
4921322	4921823	All online.
4921863	4922723	You're all in like a world.
4922743	4924044	They're usually world type games.
4926005	4929527	Looking on the HMV UK website, they're saying they're selling Excite Truck.
4930243	4932324	for pre-order for February for 50 pounds.
4932404	4935485	It's nearly $100 a disc and case in some paper.
4935805	4936405	What a rip-off.
4936705	4937526	Actually, no, it's really fun.
4938826	4940667	Yeah, but I wouldn't pay $100 for it.
4940707	4940947	Sorry.
4942147	4943648	C, what kind of music do you lot like?
4944328	4946949	Jamie mentioned ASH, which is number one of my favorites.
4947009	4952111	Rob also mentioned the music from Elite Beat Agents, which has stuff like Sum 41.
4953271	4955232	Me, my favorite bands are Gorillaz and Payne.
4957105	4959447	Actual bands or video game music?
4959807	4961148	I'm just picking music.
4961168	4969273	Because when it comes to video game music, I love all the stuff that Mizuguchi is a part of, like Space Channel 5 and Luminous and all that stuff is awesome.
4970674	4972595	And of course, Nobuo Imatsu.
4973396	4976738	When it comes to real music, which I know sounds so horrible.
4976758	4977919	I love listening to trancy stuff.
4977939	4978399	Sometimes.
4978419	4979800	It just depends on what I'm in the mood for.
4980480	4981961	And shoes.
4982822	4984242	What have I been listening to a lot lately?
4984283	4984903	I don't even know.
4985720	4987481	What's that Icelandic?
4988462	4988823	Bjork?
4989063	4989303	No.
4989723	4990264	Roixop.
4990304	4990824	I like them.
4990944	4991384	They're cool.
4991585	4992005	They're cool.
4992105	4992565	I don't like them.
4993466	4995107	I also like Death Metal.
4997489	4997729	I do.
4998009	4998390	I know you do.
4998410	5000551	Yeah, I like Gwar.
5000691	5004254	Actually, I've been listening to, really weirdly, I've been listening to a lot of Morrissey lately.
5005135	5008858	Mainly, you know, because Morrissey was our emo when we didn't have emo.
5009178	5010019	I love synth pop.
5010139	5010879	That's been my big thing.
5010919	5014522	Ever since DDR Ultramix 2 really got me into synth pop, like Echo Image and all that crap.
5014895	5015215	I love it.
5015355	5015996	Can't get enough of it.
5017496	5019958	Dee, you don't have the Nintendo Point Store in the U.S., do you?
5021539	5022579	Are they still working on that?
5022619	5023300	I haven't looked.
5023560	5023940	A what?
5024581	5025761	Nintendo Point Store.
5026682	5028062	No, we don't have that in the U.S.
5028863	5029884	The channel was there.
5030224	5040409	No, the Point Store, what they're talking about, it's basically kind of like what they have for the Nintendo Club, I think, in Japan, where you buy titles and you earn points or stars.
5040429	5041850	No, we're all pissed we don't have it.
5042291	5043111	Yeah, no, we don't have it.
5045176	5049097	Also, why doesn't Nintendo partner with voiceover IP like Skype?
5049437	5050898	The Wiimote has a speaker plus mic.
5051198	5051958	Actually, it just has a speaker.
5052198	5055139	Why doesn't Nintendo actually have some online games for the Wii yet?
5055919	5060040	I mean, it's because for some reason they feel they need to roll it out slowly.
5060140	5060920	So, whatever.
5061100	5061661	It's their strategy.
5061681	5066082	Somehow they feel they're ahead in innovation in some parts and they're really behind in other parts.
5066222	5066962	So, whatever.
5068122	5070583	Some of these questions I think we've actually already answered before.
5072057	5077380	And so skipping through, I'm going to say, what does all our team think of renting games?
5078661	5079561	Good way to test them out.
5080001	5082383	It's something I should be doing that I'm not, honestly.
5082963	5087366	I should be using that Gamefly or comparable type service, and I'm not.
5087906	5088827	I really need to look into that.
5089267	5092109	Yeah, maybe I would have avoided buying Red Steel.
5092689	5093709	This is an interesting question.
5094090	5096030	How do you go about getting a job in the game industry?
5096150	5100212	I was wondering as I have many career paths open for me at the moment, including being a doctor.
5101773	5102973	Sometimes you just chance into it.
5102993	5107835	I have a friend who was a math major who now is a programmer for a company in the Bay Area.
5107975	5109776	Well, Shane, you kind of work in the game industry.
5109816	5110656	How did you get your job?
5111912	5112472	Accident.
5113333	5113613	Really?
5113933	5116714	I was just, whoops, now I work at a game company.
5116874	5120555	It depends on people you know or if you look at Craigslist.
5121115	5125837	Lots of video game companies post entry-level positions there all the time.
5126377	5129018	But you really have to be in an area where there's game companies.
5129118	5129358	Yes.
5129978	5132879	Or your skill needs to be high in demand.
5133240	5135900	I mean, if you live in Wichita, Kansas, no offense, Shane.
5136701	5137361	That's where you used to live.
5137994	5141316	If you live there, then you're probably not going to find a whole lot of gaming jobs.
5141356	5143137	That's how I got my job.
5143177	5145199	But now you're here in California, aren't you?
5146780	5147880	It's best if you live where?
5147960	5149201	Bay Area, L.A.?
5149721	5151282	Wherever the major game companies are.
5151322	5156986	You've got Washington, the Redmond area, and then you've got the Bay Area, and then you've got L.A.
5157606	5159927	That's where you want to go for the major ones.
5161248	5167132	The reality is, though, if you're sitting there thinking, I've got a great idea for a video game.
5167152	5167412	Wisconsin.
5168707	5170288	Oh, they have the one company there.
5170529	5175852	I'm just saying, because I was thinking about Megzi.
5175872	5178814	A lot of major metros have at least one.
5178854	5183737	Keep in mind that the industry, though, is very, very diverse.
5184357	5186798	You can be an artist, get in as a designer.
5187059	5188439	You can be a writer.
5188600	5192622	I was asked if I was interested in writing game manuals.
5193374	5196937	and part of why I was going to school was to actually do manuals.
5196957	5197877	Why'd you turn that down?
5198358	5198938	I didn't turn it down.
5199279	5200860	I called on it and didn't hear anything.
5201580	5203502	And that was actually for writing strategy guides.
5203602	5205443	Sorry to hear that.
5205523	5206924	I'm in school to do what I want to do.
5206944	5208185	I'm going to be a massage therapist.
5208826	5215551	I could freaking be an independent contractor for a video game company giving massages during people's lunch.
5216437	5217177	Pac Bell does that.
5217758	5219238	Yeah, a lot of major companies do.
5219278	5220359	Our company does too.
5220459	5223761	So I could work in the video game industry as a massage therapist.
5224901	5225721	It's possible.
5226642	5228723	I would love to have that be your catch on this show.
5229083	5232405	She works in the game therapy, giving massages and happy endings.
5232785	5233805	I don't give happy endings.
5234085	5234946	You know what's funny, though?
5234966	5244590	We learned that in San Francisco, in the county, for you to be a massage therapist there, it's considered adult entertainment, so you're lumped in the same category as prostitutes.
5245431	5245671	Hot.
5246178	5249159	I know, I hate it.
5249279	5252840	The last question, I doubt that PS3 will sell many due to its high prices in the UK.
5253340	5255021	It's going to be a lot over here.
5255081	5256921	We get bummed at everything in gaming.
5258301	5260862	Most young gamers already have a 360 or at least a Wii.
5260922	5265063	Just thinking about how much market it will really have apart from now.
5265163	5267004	Wow, it's Sony's stupid fanboy impression.
5267660	5272801	I must say the graphics do look good, no better than 360, though, and played one with Ridge Racer.
5273441	5274321	But you played Ridge Racer.
5274421	5276862	That's not going to... Play Resistance, honestly.
5276902	5280542	I think that that one really plays up the system's capabilities well.
5281542	5284423	So, apart from that, though, yeah, the rest of it's crap.
5285683	5287163	Okay, I failed to keep it short, but oh well.
5287223	5288083	This week has been busy.
5288143	5290084	Going to college next week, so hope that goes well.
5290104	5291224	Until next time, Neki.
5292344	5293044	Well, thanks for the email.
5293064	5293804	That was a lot of questions.
5293924	5296805	I was like... Yeah, and I actually skipped... 20 questions from our UK...
5297946	5298647	A UK fan.
5298687	5300270	He got to L, but one repeated.
5300390	5300851	It's all good.
5301131	5301492	It's all good.
5301732	5302774	Okay, we have two more emails to go.
5302915	5303135	All right.
5304638	5308485	This one is from one of our listeners in Belgium, Fabrice.
5308525	5308925	Fabrice.
5311029	5314131	You know one good thing I liked that all games had at their little thing?
5314311	5318354	They had a big map of the world, and every time they got a caller from somewhere, they'd put a pin in the map.
5318755	5320816	I think we totally need to steal that idea.
5321156	5321657	For our email.
5321777	5323258	I'm thinking about, well, we could do both.
5323358	5324259	We do emails on callers.
5324439	5326521	We have blue pins for emails, red pins for callers.
5328502	5331304	I've only discovered OLR since episode 180 or something since then.
5331324	5332144	I've been listening every week.
5332164	5334706	Also, I can't listen to your live show because I live in Belgium.
5360544	5363125	I wonder what you at OLR think of the current state of Sega.
5363426	5366647	The last years, they've done nothing but release crappy game after crappy game.
5367128	5373211	As soon as they use the EA technique, release as much games as you can and you'll earn money easily.
5373511	5376853	Sonic the Hedgehog was somewhat the epitaph for what they are doing.
5376893	5383417	They only had some good titles, but only the short period after the Dreamcast was dead, like Panzer Dragoon Orta, etc.,
5384113	5387996	I'm a Sega fanboy, but it's even hard for me to get excited about a new Sega title.
5388577	5392560	All I'm looking forward to is Sega Rally Revo and Virtua Tennis 3.
5393521	5394322	What is wrong with them?
5394382	5395723	Do they miss their own console?
5395783	5397825	Did they go with the times?
5397865	5398946	Are they lacking the talent?
5399406	5406453	Will the Dreamcast days ever return when they made games like Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi, Shenmue, Rez, etc.?
5406893	5410216	They're all highly playable, enjoyable, and everyone, not only the hardcore gamer...
5411043	5412725	and for everyone, not only the hardcore gamer.
5413105	5416027	Sega wasn't afraid to experiment and come up with some crazy ideas.
5416528	5418529	Anyways, I wonder what your thoughts on Sega are these days.
5418589	5420831	Keep up the good work and DarkSakura Disneyland rules.
5421071	5421532	I love you.
5425335	5425775	I don't know.
5426156	5427176	This is a tough question.
5427637	5432641	I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Sega was making systems for so long and now they only make games.
5432761	5437245	So there has to be some downsizing that comes with that and some of your biggest talents jump ship.
5437905	5438886	They were just in a funk.
5439787	5440147	I think
5440842	5447288	I think though that when you are making games for your system, you know how to make it work on your system.
5447348	5457117	I think that that is a lot of strength that when it's your product and you have all the in-house stuff available to you, you know how to make the most of it.
5457918	5463603	I really think that that might be hurting them with some of the newer titles, but also I think that honestly...
5465600	5471322	I hate to say it, but Sega's going to need to get back on the track and find out what made them great to begin with.
5471402	5476023	And, you know, instead of doing all the flashy, showy stuff, they need to get back to the heart.
5476283	5478924	I think that they need to take a, you know, page from Nintendo.
5479564	5482364	Phantasy Star Universe wasn't bad, in my opinion.
5482905	5483925	It wasn't great.
5483945	5485145	Well, not really average games.
5485185	5487906	I mean, Full Auto was awesome, and Chromehounds is...
5488496	5491198	But, you know, again, most people didn't like Full Auto or Full Auto 2.
5491498	5494061	You're kind of in your own little bubble there.
5494481	5495061	I enjoyed it.
5495141	5495882	I enjoyed Full Auto.
5495902	5497703	I did end up selling it back, but I enjoyed it.
5497824	5499105	Full Auto 2 is kind of eh.
5499725	5504869	But, I mean, hell, they've got a ton of cool games coming out pretty soon.
5505069	5507411	Sonic and the Secret Rings, which should be pretty cool.
5507451	5510854	I mean, as long as the control is good on it.
5511034	5511835	Virtua Fighter 5.
5512235	5514917	I mean, that's going to be a pretty solid fighting game for the PS3.
5514957	5516859	Sega Rallye Revo.
5518655	5523576	Armored Core 4, the game that I've been waiting for for the longest time.
5523596	5531838	I bought Chromehounds thinking, hey, maybe it's like Armored Core 4, but no, it's like Armored Core 4 with Mono or something like that.
5533138	5534159	We need Knights on Wii.
5534899	5536759	I want to say some interesting comments from chat.
5536779	5539800	DDRDollarBill says, Sega needs to make more games that are unique.
5542061	5546382	Bandit says, first Sega starts making consoles, then drop that and just got into games.
5546602	5547602	Sony, you're next.
5549119	5553182	SSJ100 Matt has an idea on how Sega can get back to their roots.
5553242	5555243	Two words, blast processing.
5568089	5569550	SEGA TASANSHIRO!
5590126	5596810	or, you know what, I hate to say it, but since Nintendo doesn't have the oomph behind it, you know, with the Wii, the Wii doesn't have that pretty stuff.
5596870	5608197	I'm sure there will be inevitably an F-Zero game on the Wii that will be pretty awesome, but seriously, like, if Sega made a racer kind of like that, I'm not talking full auto, on the 360, oh, that would be hot.
5608577	5609098	Oh, it would be hot.
5609238	5611960	You know what, actually, franchise, I wouldn't mind seeing coming out on the next system.
5612000	5612340	Or PS3.
5612760	5617463	There was a, I believe it was a Sega, it was Burning Rangers franchise.
5618888	5621970	In fact, I know it was because the music was on freaking Samba de Amigo.
5622470	5625212	But we need Burning Rangers to come back.
5625973	5629395	To clarify for chat, because they're saying F-Zero was done by Sega, not the original, obviously.
5629435	5633398	I'm sorry, I meant the GameCube version in Arcade, GX and AX.
5634078	5642844	AX was Namco, Sega, Nintendo, the Triforce, and then GX was just Sega and Nintendo.
5642884	5646447	And I'll tell you what, booting that game for the first time and seeing both those logos on the screen at the same time
5647438	5649460	I was a weird feeling for me, the 80s gamer.
5649480	5649920	I'm sorry.
5650020	5652543	Did it make you feel happy in the pants?
5652703	5654224	No, it made me feel weird.
5655726	5658869	I'm looking at this going, but Sega does what Nintendo don't.
5659029	5661151	I don't... This is beyond comprehension.
5662272	5662872	Another email?
5662892	5664093	That actually was the last of our emails.
5664113	5664374	Oh, it wasn't?
5664394	5664994	Another window opened.
5665274	5665575	Okay.
5666275	5667837	So, yeah, send us more.
5667897	5668457	Send us more.
5668818	5671180	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
5671240	5671981	I'm sure after...
5672677	5675018	Some of our stories tonight, we'll get plenty of emails.
5675038	5676779	Oh, dude, Battletoads vs. Double Dragon.
5676859	5678480	Hell yeah, we need a new one of that.
5678500	5679100	Did Sega do that?
5680241	5682842	It was on Genesis.
5682882	5685343	Wasn't Tecmo responsible for both those franchises?
5685523	5686744	I can't remember.
5686764	5691066	Streets of Rage was Burning Knuckle.
5691086	5691986	Battletoads was Rare.
5692527	5695008	No, Battletoads was Acclaim, I want to say.
5696260	5696660	I'll remember.
5697120	5698601	Making me go to Wikipedia.
5699722	5703484	Um, so anyways, we've got some interesting stuff about Nintendo, actually.
5703544	5708327	MadCatz is doing a third-party Wiimote that looks like a penis.
5709027	5711328	So, um, way to go, MadCatz.
5711428	5716111	You've taken the Wii and made it look like a sex toy.
5717191	5717652	Excellent.
5718472	5721694	Uh, yeah, it's supposed to be more ergonomic looking, but it looks like a penis.
5722034	5722414	I'm sorry.
5723575	5724055	So, um,
5725106	5728348	Be sure to pick up your third-party penis by Mad Catz.
5728788	5729408	Coming soon.
5730769	5731049	Joy.
5731329	5731609	Lovely.
5732050	5737592	I remember them saying they were going to have the third-party Wiimotes, but it's kind of interesting to see what some of them look like.
5737672	5738573	That looks like a penis.
5738873	5739953	No, it doesn't.
5740094	5741614	It does so look like a penis.
5741894	5742655	Where are the balls?
5743355	5744596	Okay, well, just a shaft.
5745516	5745996	Let me see.
5747937	5749358	It looks like a vibrator.
5749898	5752840	That doesn't look like any penis I've ever seen.
5753662	5754022	Fine.
5754123	5755564	It looks like a sex toy, though.
5757205	5768614	Hey, and with those freaking homemade programs that you can use your Bluetooth devices for, including the Wii vibrator thing, there you go.
5768974	5770916	They've made a complete package for you.
5771737	5773678	By the way, thank you, Wikipedia.
5773758	5776761	Battletoads was a video game franchise by Tradewest.
5777241	5780083	The first game was released by Rare for the NES in 1991.
5782435	5782956	There you go.
5783196	5786600	And I remember, I think TradeWest had something to do with Double Dragon too, if that makes sense.
5789263	5791646	Yeah, they made the original Double Dragon on the NES.
5791666	5792027	There you go.
5792527	5793368	Or published it, whatever.
5794149	5794450	Alright.
5795771	5798493	Anyhow, this is a good time for us to take a break, I think.
5798513	5800815	We've been going for a little while here, so we're going to take ourselves a little break.
5801315	5804218	And we will come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5804878	5809862	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
5810322	5814626	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
