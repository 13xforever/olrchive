0	24000	New developments with the Guitar Hero series, including Drum Villain, and Can You Fix a
24000	33000	Broken 360 with Towels?
33000	36320	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
36320	40720	I say welcome back because we missed a show last week, but we'll get into that in a moment.
40720	42160	First, let's introduce ourselves.
42160	45880	We are that podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know about video
45880	48080	game culture and the video game lifestyle.
48080	49080	My name is Rob Roberts.
49080	52480	Joining me, as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
52480	53480	Yo, what up?
53480	56640	How are you doing, Ms. Summers?
56640	58480	I'm alive, sort of.
58480	59480	That's good.
59480	60480	That's good.
60480	63160	I had a very good time last week on our weekend off with you.
63160	64400	We had a great time.
64400	68000	Myself and Dark Sakura and the OLR lesbians all went to Disneyland, and it was a good
68000	69000	time.
69000	72680	We had a very interesting time.
72680	76360	And I know some listeners sometimes give Jamie a hard time because she talks about Disneyland
76360	78000	a lot on this show, and I'm one of them.
78000	82420	I have a hard time talking about Disneyland so much on this program, but I kind of get
82420	83420	it now.
83420	86840	We've had a great time, and it really is something else.
86840	88240	Space Mountain four times.
88240	90360	Rocking Space Mountain four times in a row was awesome.
90360	92600	I think it's just really cool.
92600	95160	I remember that we have day jobs.
95160	99880	OLR is not what we do for a living, and it's just kind of nice to have a week off to go
99880	100880	have nothing but fun.
100880	103760	And that's what Disneyland was really all about, was just fun and good friends and good
103760	104760	times.
104760	105760	It was great.
105760	106760	I had a really good time.
106760	107760	Group hug.
107760	108760	All right.
108760	110720	Anyway, also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.
110720	111720	Hello.
111720	112720	How you doing, Loki?
112720	113720	I'm fine.
113720	114720	What did you do last week?
114720	141120	I also went to that same reception with Loki.
141120	142120	That's right.
142120	145680	And you went to the folks who got married through Final Fantasy XI, right?
145680	146680	Yes.
146680	148040	You don't play Final Fantasy XI anymore, though, right?
148040	151040	I did for the past two weeks.
151040	152040	What made you...
152040	153040	But you quit again.
153040	154040	Yes, I quit again.
154040	156840	So what made you decide to start playing Final Fantasy XI and then quit again?
156840	160980	Because I missed it, and then when I came back, I played it, and then I didn't miss
160980	161980	it anymore.
161980	164020	So it was time to cancel.
164020	166040	What made you decide you did the right thing by quitting?
166040	168360	What do you mean, what made me decide?
168360	171440	Well, because you said you went back for two weeks, and then you quit.
171440	174880	So obviously, you must have come to the conclusion during those two weeks that, oh, I made the
174880	175880	right decision quitting.
175880	176880	Oh, yeah.
176880	180240	Well, because being a blue mage is freaking boring trying to get those spells, and when
180240	186240	you spend two hours hunting this one monster, trying to get one spell off of it, you realize
186240	189640	that your time could be better spent somewhere else.
189640	192680	Like looking for a party.
192680	193680	All right.
193680	196600	Look at the chatroom comments here at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
196600	200640	We always invite the chatters to always be another guest here on the program, and they
200640	201640	have their comments.
201640	203280	We have some really good voicemails this week, by the way.
203280	206560	We're going to get to it later on in Part B. Just another way we encourage you guys
206560	208200	to interact with us.
208200	212620	Shadow Slayer says, just sat around and talked equals strippers.
212620	213620	Is this true?
213620	219160	No, it's just in his mom's coffee shop, so sitting around talking is literally sitting
219160	220160	around talking.
220160	222360	Lattes and strippers, good times.
222360	224360	I wish.
224360	229840	Nellie and I were hoping for strippers with fireworks and jet packs, and we actually almost
229840	233480	got somebody to believe that that was going to happen, but they were an idiot, so it doesn't
233480	234480	matter.
234480	236560	That would be Kat, and she was an idiot.
236560	237840	Wait, like literally.
237840	239240	Does Kat listen to this program?
239240	240240	Can she defend herself?
240240	242720	I don't think she knows how to operate a computer, okay?
242720	243720	All right.
243720	244720	She's a complete idiot.
244720	245720	All right.
245720	250160	Well, welcome back, of course, to all of our live listeners and our podcast listeners since
250160	251720	there was no program last week.
251720	255960	Again, we apologize for not being here, but now that the holidays are over and we're all
255960	259400	back into our daily routine, unfortunately, we're kind of in a situation where Jamie's
259400	264060	doing school in the early evenings, and Loki has to go to bed early for his job, which
264060	267680	takes out the late evenings, so it's very hard for us to pre-record when we're not here
267680	270640	on Sundays, so sorry about that, but that's what happened.
270640	274580	If you were here listening live, though, Travis Donovan from our Saturday Night program on
274580	280320	Orange Launch Radio did a real fantastic little tribute program, and if you listen to one
280320	285520	of our buddy podcasts, All Games Interactive, Dark Soccer and I appeared on the Friday edition,
285520	290760	and it was something else.
290760	291760	It was a good time, though.
291760	292760	It was slightly embarrassing.
292760	293760	Yeah.
293760	294760	It was a good time.
294760	295760	I had fun.
295760	296760	That's what it's all about.
296760	298240	I need to find the podcast for that since I wasn't there.
298240	299320	I didn't really.
299320	300320	You were missed, though.
300320	302280	They kept saying it was two-thirds of Orange Launch Radio.
302280	303280	Where's Loki?
303280	304280	Why isn't he here?
304280	305280	Why doesn't he like us?
305280	308320	We had to kind of explain that, so it was good, though.
308320	314520	I didn't realize that their Free Play Fridays were so free, but it was a good time.
314520	315520	I had a really good time.
315520	317280	Thanks to Scott for having us on.
317280	318280	It's good.
318280	323640	I like doing radio with Scott because he plays such different types of games than we do that
323640	325520	it's fun to kind of debate a little bit.
325520	330080	We got into that a little bit on the Free Play Friday show before things all went to
330080	332600	hell in a good way.
332600	333600	We had a really good time.
333600	334600	We hope to go back sometime.
334600	336780	We've gotten some real positive feedback from that.
336780	340120	I know there was something in the mailbag that maybe Dark Soccer is going to read for
340120	341120	us later.
341120	342120	I think we had a voicemail, too.
342120	344880	I don't think we were going to play the voicemail, but somebody had left us a voicemail and said
344880	347880	it was really great.
347880	352640	We love doing radio with those guys and kind of coming together in that Voltron-esque sense
352640	353960	to do radio together.
353960	354960	It was cool.
354960	357240	Miklotov says, how about Power Rangers instead?
357240	359840	I'm going to say Power Rangers ripped off Voltron.
359840	363440	Does anybody watch Power Rangers anymore except you?
363440	366400	There's another guy at my work that does, and we're going to have an Operation Overdrive
366400	369240	party when the new season premieres.
369240	372120	Let's talk a little bit about how is your gaming week, because that's how we always
372120	373120	like to start off the show.
373120	376120	We've got a couple of weeks to cover here, so we'll start off with Dark Soccer.
376120	377120	How was your gaming week?
377120	384080	I played Cook and Mama and Astro Blasters at Disneyland.
384080	385080	It counts as a game, right?
385080	388000	Astro Blasters is one of the best video games I've ever played in my life.
388000	389360	That was some good times.
389360	393440	We might be getting another pinball machine that you would be interested in.
393440	394440	What's that?
394440	395440	Bride of Pinbot.
395440	396440	Sweet.
396440	397440	Very cool.
397440	398440	I told Dan to try to get it for me.
398440	400120	Not a lot of console stuff otherwise?
400120	401120	Not really.
401120	405760	I almost got rid of PSU and then went, nah.
405760	413760	I turned on Guild Wars and then said, nah.
413760	416880	It just went through the whole booting and patching and that whole process.
416880	417880	You were like, nah.
417880	418880	Yeah, pretty much.
418880	419880	That was it.
419880	420880	All right.
420880	421880	Good times.
421880	423320	Loki, how was your gaming week?
423320	424320	My gaming week was good.
424320	431760	I had a gaming party last night actually and Rob was there and he can attest to the fact.
431760	439160	WarioWare Smooth Moves is fun but playing it with 11 people at the same time is crazy
439160	444160	and it adds a whole new element of fun into it that I don't even know how to describe.
444160	451600	I have never had a video gaming experience quite like 11 player WarioWare.
451600	453120	I don't know how to describe it.
453120	454120	It was insane.
454120	459040	Just so you guys know, in WarioWare, you only get to use one baton.
459040	461200	They call it the baton in the game but it's Wiimote.
461200	464080	You only get to use one Wiimote in multiplayer.
464080	471520	So part of the fun of it was actually passing off the baton in time to other people.
471520	473280	It was actually kind of funny.
473280	474480	The whole thing is ridiculous.
474480	481160	They have your Miis flying around like this angel form and it really looks weird.
481160	487560	So you have all these weird Mi faces with this angel body thing that doesn't even fit
487560	491520	and then you have these games that you're playing and it keeps getting faster and everyone
491520	492520	was just cracking up.
492520	493840	It was just a lot of fun.
493840	496760	Did you notice how OLR totally dominated the multiplayer games?
496760	500960	Because you won one, Megalotov won one, Extra for won one and I won one.
500960	501960	We played it four times.
501960	502960	Well, we played games more than that.
502960	503960	No, I know.
503960	504960	That's true.
504960	505960	So we did that.
505960	506960	That was really fun.
506960	510940	But that's just because at this gamer party, you had some casual gamers there.
510940	515000	What were the level of people like Tiffany and Heather and the other Rob?
515000	516740	Did they play a lot of games?
516740	518440	My sister plays quite a bit.
518440	523160	She's finished Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 and she's played through Zelda and all this stuff.
523160	524160	So she plays quite a bit.
524160	526040	She has my GameCube right now.
526040	527040	Because they were all into it.
527040	528840	The only person that didn't seem so into it was Nellie.
528840	529840	She was kind of like, I hate this.
529840	530840	Nellie doesn't play too many games.
530840	531840	But she laughed.
531840	532840	I mean, she just laughed.
532840	535240	And then Tiffany really doesn't play that many games.
535240	538780	I think she may play a little bit of the Xbox, but she wants to get a Wii.
538780	540560	She doesn't have one yet.
540560	541560	So that's funny.
541560	545160	And then Mel, of course, plays some stuff.
545160	550360	And everyone plays a pretty average amount of games and stuff.
550360	555300	So I think a lot of people really liked it and definitely people that were going to get
555300	559640	a Wii are probably going to get this game as well because it's just crazy.
559640	561640	The dance mini game was hilarious.
561640	565640	Yeah, Shane shared this idea with us that you can do the dance.
565640	569560	You go into the mode where you just play a mini game over and over again and you do the
569560	572120	dance mini game, but you set it on the fastest setting.
572120	573120	It's pretty funny.
573120	574120	It's fun to watch.
574120	575760	Yeah, it's crazy.
575760	579160	And then we played Resistance Fall Man.
579160	582880	We've been playing that all week during lunches and we played that last night too for a while.
582880	586440	And I had a really interesting glitch after you left.
586440	588020	We were playing multiplayer.
588020	591280	First we started off with just doing four player multiplayer and stuff.
591280	593780	And that's a fun game, multiplayer.
593780	597420	Then we decided rockets only, infinite ammo.
597420	598920	And we picked really tiny maps.
598920	606800	And that was pretty fun, except one time I spawned and I just kept flying up into the
606800	607800	air.
607800	608800	So it was really weird.
608800	611680	That was kind of funny.
611680	614000	You guys were playing Red Steel at one point too.
614000	615000	That's about it.
615000	616280	I was going to get to Red Steel.
616280	618280	Did it play as god awful as it looked?
618280	623340	Because I haven't really played a lot of Red Steel, but that game did not look fun when
623340	626040	you guys were playing a multiplayer.
626040	631240	It was not like when everybody was playing WarioWare where everyone knew what to do.
631240	633880	The thing shows you how to hold the controller and you kind of take it from there.
633880	635640	But Red Steel was like, how do I hang up the phone?
635640	636800	What the hell am I doing?
636800	639960	I had never played Red Steel four player.
639960	641640	I've only done it two or three.
641640	645960	So I figured, okay, let's give it another try on a bigger TV so you can actually see
645960	647840	what's going on and stuff.
647840	653200	And so four player, I thought it'd be cool if we tried the mode where the Wiimote rings
653200	658320	like a phone and you pick it up and you get a mission from the person on the line.
658320	664140	Well, it's a cool concept, but it's completely annoying and stupid at the same time.
664140	665840	So Red Steel really sucks.
665840	667280	You can't control it for shit.
667280	672240	The little phone mode, I mean, the thing is ringing all the goddamn time and stupid shit
672240	676920	like kill the cook and it'll use an Uzi or something like that.
676920	681400	And if you don't pick up the phone, it'll just keep ringing for you and it's just really
681400	682400	annoying.
682400	685040	You know, this is the last draw for this game.
685040	686440	I'm definitely selling it back now.
686440	689520	I mean, it was a complete waste of money in the first place.
689520	690920	It's just an utter disappointment.
690920	694420	I wanted to give it a second chance and so I did and it's awful.
694420	696960	That's the first time you asked me like, do you want to play this?
696960	699440	And I was like, no, I don't.
699440	700440	Yeah.
700440	701880	So that really sucked.
701880	706560	And then I'm trying to think what else we played there.
706560	708200	Rob D. in chat agrees with you.
708200	709200	Loki's right.
709200	710200	Phone mode sucks.
710200	711200	It always rings.
711200	712200	You can't hear it.
712200	716840	I mean, it sounded like a cool concept in the beginning, you know, when they were talking
716840	720640	about it, but it's just horribly, horribly executed.
720640	723720	So, you know, I can't recommend that game at all.
723720	728360	And then finally, you know, we're playing more Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, which
728360	730640	I hear is now coming out on PlayStation 2.
730640	734280	My boss will be extremely happy about that.
734280	737320	And just, you know, the usual stuff.
737320	741000	But yeah, right now Wario War is going to have to hold me over until SSX comes out.
741000	747680	It kind of sucks with only one game coming out in the month, but that's about it.
747680	749680	All right.
749680	750680	Can I make an interjection?
750680	751680	Sure.
751680	752680	Why not?
752680	753680	There's one other game.
753680	754680	Okay.
754680	755680	What's that?
755680	756680	R-Type 3.
756680	757680	Oh, on the virtual console?
757680	758680	Oh, yeah.
758680	759680	How was that?
759680	761280	Well, I actually never had R-Type 3 before, so it was actually really fun.
761280	766440	And I love the mode 7-tastic stuff that happens in it, because as you're going through it,
766440	768920	it's like it fully has a real 3D feel to it.
768920	773920	And my favorite thing is, like, right at the beginning, when these, I guess, sort of mini-boss
773920	777760	type things pop up, you can kill them in one, you know, charge shot.
777760	781440	And then another one comes up behind you, and then he swings around you, and then you
781440	782580	bitch can't kill him.
782580	786280	And then he suddenly looks behind him and runs into a wall and blows up.
786280	788160	You know, how is it as a shooter game?
788160	789280	I was contemplating getting it.
789280	790280	I don't know much about R-Type.
790280	791280	It's R-Type!
791280	793480	I can get it!
793480	797400	I never really owned a Turbo Grafx-16 or a Sega back in the day.
797400	798400	Did you get the first R-Type?
798400	799400	I did.
799400	801120	And it kind of reminded me of Gradius, really.
801120	802120	It was just like Gradius.
802120	803120	It's hard.
803120	804120	It is.
804120	805120	It was a little harder than Gradius.
805120	806120	R-Type is hard.
806120	809760	R-Type 3 is, sort of to me, like a faster paced R-Type.
809760	810760	For eight bucks?
810760	812640	Should I spend eight bucks on it?
812640	813640	Yeah!
813640	814640	Sure!
814640	815640	R-Type!
815640	820260	It's actually one of the only R-Type games, actually I think, yeah, that was specifically
820260	821260	for Super Nintendo.
821260	822260	Check it out.
822260	823260	Check it out.
823260	824260	It's worth it.
824260	825260	Maybe you should come over to your house and play it first.
825260	826260	No, you're going to download it.
826260	827260	Alright, fine.
827260	828680	Let's see how you are.
828680	830520	Miklotov, how was your gaming week?
830520	832520	What have you been playing?
832520	836920	Well, I'm still playing the crap out of Elite Beat Agents because I can't get enough of
836920	845680	it and I'm almost down to zero everything except for Elite Beats on Jumping Jack Flash
845680	850360	on Elite Beat Viva's difficulty.
850360	854640	And let's see, I just picked up Final Fantasy III for the DS because it's in stock again,
854640	861240	which is nice, and I played Final Fantasy for two weeks and now I'm playing Burning
861240	862240	Crusade.
862240	863240	Oops.
863240	866240	How's Burning Crusade?
866240	870360	My blood elf is really pretty and he jumps around and twirls, it's great.
870360	874400	What made you decide to go on to Burning Crusade?
874400	881840	Everybody else is doing it and I like to follow people, so I'm easily swayed.
881840	882840	And it's fun.
882840	883840	I like it.
883840	884840	It's cool.
884840	885840	Alright, good times.
885840	886840	You want to tell people your server and characters?
886840	887840	They can come play with you?
887840	888840	Or would you rather stay anonymous?
888840	889840	I don't care.
889840	899000	My server is Ravencrest and my character's name is Arx and I'm a 13 blood elf priest.
899000	901020	Is there any reason why you chose Ravencrest?
901020	904560	Because it reminded me of Ravenclaw because that sounds like something Harry Potter-ish.
904560	905560	Alright.
905560	910600	I was going to say, as you mentioned, that Final Fantasy III is back in stock now.
910600	916200	They've been actually sold out of a lot of stuff, especially the DS Lite.
916200	917960	Nintendo is actually completely sold out now.
917960	921840	They should be coming to the stores in the next week or so, finally catching up.
921840	922840	Same with the Wii.
922840	925840	The Wii's been sold out for a while too.
925840	927720	Nintendo's kind of slow right now.
927720	930200	Sony's kind of showing them up with the amount of units they're getting out there, but no
930200	931680	one's buying them.
931680	936240	Well, my gaming week, a lot of the same stuff most people have actually already beaten me
936240	937240	to and mentioned.
937240	940560	You know, there was Buzz Lightyear ride at Disneyland, which was a lot of fun.
940560	943020	You know what's weird is that the first time we went through it, we rode that ride three
943020	944920	times and the first time was our best score.
944920	946600	We should post that picture on Orange Lounge somewhere.
946600	948200	It's kind of funny.
948200	951440	You got the 38th best score for the day or something, the high score.
951440	952440	I think so.
952440	953440	You kicked my butt at it.
953440	957240	Out of how many thousands of people that went on it?
957240	963560	Well, the whole reason we got so high of a score was because it broke down while we were
963560	964560	on it.
964560	969600	Yeah, because the other times we never stopped in the middle of the ride.
969600	970800	I've done really well on that ride.
970800	974080	I can at least get to a rank four on a regular run-through.
974080	978000	But then I was chatting from the hotel room with Bobby over at All Games and he's like,
978000	979000	well, I got a million.
979000	980000	Did you get a million?
980000	981000	I'm like...
981000	982720	Yeah, but his ride stopped too.
982720	987760	All right, so I played that.
987760	991360	I've gone back to World of Warcraft thanks to Burning Crusade, which is funny though
991360	993720	because I didn't buy Burning Crusade.
993720	1000920	There's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me because I'm not all like, ooh, ah, over Blood
1000920	1004200	Elves and Draenei because everybody is playing those.
1004200	1008240	And especially if you look at the server that Shane and I are playing on, because we always
1008240	1010640	start on a freaking new server, Ravencrest.
1010640	1012860	I'm playing a Tauren on Ravencrest.
1012860	1014600	I'm not running into anybody.
1014600	1015880	It's like a new server.
1015880	1019720	All I see are Blood Elves and they're all paladins and they make me want to punch them
1019720	1023720	because it's annoying because they're all just kind of ganging up on my kills I'm trying
1023720	1024720	to get.
1024720	1028100	Yeah, so it's interesting.
1028100	1030520	And I thought, well, there's not a lot in Burning Crusade for me.
1030520	1031520	I mean, sure, there's new areas.
1031520	1033920	You can level to 70 in the jewelcrafting.
1033920	1038240	But I'm like, okay, I don't want to make that investment unless I actually stick with World
1038240	1039240	of Warcraft.
1039240	1042000	Because if you've been listening to this show for a couple of years, you know that I'm notorious.
1042000	1045820	I'll play World of Warcraft for three months, quit, then start over again in a couple months
1045820	1046820	on a new server.
1046820	1051480	But actually, I said, okay, Rob, if you can get a character to level 40, I will reward
1051480	1052800	you by buying Burning Crusade.
1052800	1054440	There you go.
1054440	1056640	And I'm already at what, 11 or 12?
1056640	1060880	Well, yeah, but the first 10 levels you can do in like an hour.
1060880	1061880	Whatever.
1061880	1068240	Anyway, but what's funny is that since Shane had the discs, I installed it on the computer
1068240	1070360	and so I still have like the pretty intro screen.
1070360	1073160	But it's kind of neat to have Burning Crusade installed but you don't have access.
1073160	1075720	So if you're kind of wondering, like if you're out there wondering what happens if I like
1075720	1080000	Borrow a Friend's discs but I don't have the code, you still get some things changed
1080000	1083040	like the intro screen and some of the loading screens.
1083040	1086360	And certainly, you know, you can see everybody but I don't think the game will let you do
1086360	1087760	anything special outside of that.
1087760	1089480	That's probably all I'm really getting from that.
1089480	1091200	So I am going to have to buy a code at some point.
1091200	1093880	When I get to level 40, that's my reward for myself.
1093880	1096200	I've also been playing WarioWare Smooth Moves.
1096200	1097200	Love it.
1097200	1098720	It's an awesome game.
1098720	1103560	But I think it kind of suffers from the WarioWare series syndrome where that I don't see much
1103560	1109360	– let me rephrase that – I don't see much single player replay ability after about
1109360	1113480	five hours with the game because once you've unlocked all the mini games, not a lot else
1113480	1114480	to do.
1114480	1117200	And that's kind of the same way all the WarioWares have been in the past.
1117200	1122680	But multiplayer is really cool and I think really breathes more life into the game that
1122680	1125120	the other WarioWares didn't have so much.
1125120	1130480	I mean, I know the GameCube one had multiplayer that was kind of fun but this one especially
1130480	1132880	because, you know, the more pick up and go element of it.
1132880	1135680	So I think if you have people that you can play this with – like if you're the type
1135680	1140360	of person that would own Mario Party, you definitely should own WarioWare.
1140360	1144680	But if you're just one person, I actually think this is a title that's a really good
1144680	1145680	rental.
1145680	1148840	Like it's probably the best rental title right now possibly out there because I do
1148840	1152080	think it's the type of game you're going to breeze through pretty quickly.
1152080	1153080	It's fun.
1153080	1154080	It's easy to pick up.
1154080	1155720	It's got a great sense of humor.
1155720	1160020	A lot of the characters from the old WarioWare games are back but, again, I just don't
1160020	1163520	see where there's going to be a lot to this game after you've played it for three hours
1163520	1167520	unless you are a perfectionist and you must master every game.
1167520	1170080	But if you're a Nintendo fanboy, you probably already own it so what are you listening to
1170080	1171080	me for?
1171080	1172980	Well, would you agree with that, Logie?
1172980	1176520	You know, this whole thing kind of reminds me of, you know, there could be more life
1176520	1181760	in this game if they had, I don't know, leaderboards or something like that supported
1181760	1186900	on the Nintendo Wii but since they don't and Nintendo's a fucking retard for not
1186900	1191920	doing that, you know, there's not as much life as there could be, you know?
1191920	1192920	I don't know.
1192920	1197040	Simple fixes like a leaderboard system or something for each individual game would be
1197040	1198040	pretty cool.
1198040	1199040	All right.
1199040	1202880	Well, I think that's about, do I have anything else for my gaming week?
1202880	1203880	Not really.
1203880	1204880	I've just pretty much been playing those.
1204880	1208760	Not a whole lot of, oh, no, there is one new game I wanted to mention also.
1208760	1212920	I bought Heavy Weapon on Xbox Live Arcade which is a PopCap game, you know, the folks
1212920	1216080	that made Bejeweled and Zuma but Heavy Weapon is a very different type of game.
1216080	1217080	It's not a puzzle game.
1217080	1218080	It's more of an action game.
1218080	1222080	It reminds me of an old 16-bit shooter and a lot of people have been giving Heavy Weapon
1222080	1226580	a lot of crap because, you know, they go, oh, another PopCap game.
1226580	1228160	It's coming out after Ms. Pac-Man.
1228160	1231280	God, the live arcade line-up sucks, you know.
1231280	1235440	I could play this on, you know, for free on Flash and da-da-da-da-da.
1235440	1239500	I think a lot of people are passing judgment on this game before playing it and I would
1239500	1242560	bet some of your favorite bloggers are doing this too after reading one or reading some
1242560	1246840	bloggers because people were posting those types of opinions before the game even came
1246840	1247840	out.
1247840	1251200	So they were basing their opinions, I know this, off the Flash version of the game.
1251200	1255040	I do think you should download the demo and check it out, especially if you like those
1255040	1259540	old 16-bit type of shooters because it actually is a lot of fun and I played multiplayer with
1259540	1262720	some strangers to, you know, try and get some more achievements and just kind of have fun,
1262720	1263720	see what it was all about.
1263720	1268240	I actually thought it was pretty fun and I know you can't do the multiplayer through
1268240	1272100	the free Flash game and there's a lot of different types of stages.
1272100	1274960	I actually think it's kind of an underrated purchase right now.
1274960	1281520	I think I enjoyed this much more than I enjoyed Small Arms or Novidrome or some of those other
1281520	1284880	originals they were really hyping up or RoboBlitz even.
1284880	1288500	I didn't really enjoy any of those games as much as I enjoyed Heavy Weapon.
1288500	1293000	So I really think don't listen to people who pass judgment on this game just because
1293000	1295520	it's PopCap and they have it, you know, on the website.
1295520	1299240	You know, if the website is good enough for you and you play the net with them, fine,
1299240	1301460	you know, then you don't need to spend the $10.
1301460	1304600	But if you enjoy those types of games, I think you'd really benefit from multiplayer and
1304600	1306000	some of the other modes this game has.
1306000	1310740	I had a lot of fun with it and I kind of want to play it again when, you know, my TV is
1310740	1313880	free of Elibits because Xtaphir has been playing Elibits non-stop.
1313880	1314880	He beat it.
1314880	1315880	I saw the final boss in the game.
1315880	1317720	It was like this Voltron Elibit type thing.
1317720	1318720	It's crazy.
1318720	1320560	It was like I didn't know Elibits was so long.
1320560	1326080	I guess it has like 25, 26 stages and the stages in that game go on for like 10-20 minutes
1326080	1327080	at a time.
1327080	1330840	So there's quite a bit of replayability in Elibits, I was surprised.
1330840	1335000	I do recommend Heavy Weapon for those fans of shooters, at least even if you just have
1335000	1336000	access to Xbox Live.
1336000	1337000	Check out the demo.
1337000	1338720	You might like it.
1338720	1341640	Well that's pretty much all I got for How Was My Gaming Week.
1341640	1343040	So that's all of us.
1343040	1346480	So now we're going to go on to housekeeping, which we don't really have a lot of this week.
1346480	1348400	There's not a lot of new news going on with the station.
1348400	1351560	You know, we still have our site trucking along and hope to bring you a new website
1351560	1355640	pretty soon, although it's a lot of work we're finding.
1355640	1360420	Also just a reminder, we do have programming here on orangeontrader.com almost every week
1360420	1362240	night throughout the week.
1362240	1365640	First Tuesday of every month, Dark Soccer is live with Pump Up The Volume, so she's
1365640	1367640	due for a new show pretty soon.
1367640	1370160	Wednesday nights, guys on the show, myself and Exeterfer.
1370160	1373260	Thursday nights, STFU with DMN and DJ Tyrant.
1373260	1376120	Friday night, Club OLR mixed by Loki.
1376120	1380200	And Saturday nights, Travis Donovan live, which is always pretty hilarious and he does
1380200	1382160	a lot of the chat room interaction stuff too.
1382160	1384440	So check those shows out.
1384440	1388200	And getting on into the news this week, this was something we actually talked about on
1388200	1389760	one of the spinoff shows.
1389760	1395120	And I'm sure you've heard this story talked about to death in the various gaming blogs
1395120	1398080	out there and on the various websites out there.
1398080	1400600	We don't want to spend a whole lot of time on it tonight.
1400600	1407320	But I do find it very ironic that the week we decide to take off a show, huge news happens
1407320	1408680	literally in our backyard.
1408680	1409920	I mean literally.
1409920	1414380	And of course we're referring to the Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest that one of our
1414380	1417680	local stations here, 107.9 held.
1417680	1421040	Our morning rave show or whatever held this Hold Your Wee for a Wee contest.
1421040	1425280	And unfortunately it ended, or I should say resulted, because it was about a couple hours
1425280	1430240	after the contest ended, resulted in the death of Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old who was
1430240	1432560	trying to win a wee for her family.
1432560	1438680	And what's very interesting, Jennifer Strange lives, or lived, not even about two miles
1438680	1440520	from where we record Orange Lawn's radio.
1440520	1445000	So it's kind of, it was kind of weird, kind of hit home that whole story.
1445000	1449040	At first, I don't know about you guys when you heard about this, but at first I was kind
1449040	1454920	of thinking this isn't, because I was reading about it on Kotaku, Destructoid, and all those
1454920	1455920	gaming blogs.
1455920	1458260	I was thinking this really isn't about gaming.
1458260	1462080	I mean I understand why these sites covered it, so I'm not trying to fault that or anything,
1462080	1465480	but I'm kind of thinking to myself, we're really digging a hole for this.
1465480	1467120	I mean it's not really about the gaming.
1467120	1473600	I mean surely it's a tragic story, but that goes more to the whole where was the responsibility,
1473600	1477800	the DJs, the station, the woman that competed in the contest, you know, all that types of
1477800	1478940	back and forth.
1478940	1483360	But then, earlier this week, I caught something very interesting on the nightly news, because
1483360	1487260	as you can imagine here in this area, in the Sacramento area, this story has really dominated
1487260	1492520	the nightly news, just as when three years ago, someone passed away of the same thing
1492520	1493680	in a frat hazing in Chico.
1493680	1497620	I mean that dominated our local news for the longest time, a water intoxication took the
1497620	1498620	life of theirs.
1498620	1502960	Somebody was telling me at work the other day, in the past, I think in the past five
1502960	1506080	years in the Sacramento region, three people have died of water intoxication, which is
1506080	1507080	abnormal.
1507080	1508080	That's not normal.
1508080	1511120	So it's weird that, you know, move to Sacramento, don't drink water.
1511120	1513280	It's sort of like drowning yourself.
1513280	1514280	Well, it is.
1514280	1516000	Essentially, it's kind of what you're doing.
1516000	1518960	But anyway, so I'm thinking, okay, it's not really gaming related.
1518960	1521520	I don't know if we should talk about it on Sunday's show, because it's kind of been talked
1521520	1522520	about to death.
1522520	1523840	But then this late breaking thing happened.
1523840	1528120	I caught the news on Thursday, okay, and I posted about this to OrangeLawnTrader.com.
1528120	1531560	We were watching local news and they were talking about this whole thing.
1531560	1536240	The reporter, I guess, had talked to the lawyer, and the reporter said that they were considering
1536240	1538800	expanding the lawsuit that was filed against the station.
1538800	1541400	I mean, obviously, a civil lawsuit was filed in her death.
1541400	1543280	I mean, I think we all saw that coming.
1543280	1548880	The lawsuit is being considered to expand Nintendo and promoters for Justin Timberlake,
1548880	1551640	because Justin Timberlake's tickets were involved in this concert, too.
1551640	1553040	They were in the contest, too.
1553040	1554520	They were a consolation prize.
1554520	1558240	And now, it's kind of, well, now we're kind of roping it back into gaming, because Nintendo
1558240	1560120	could get sued over this whole thing.
1560120	1562640	It's stupid.
1562640	1563640	It's really stupid.
1563640	1564640	They had nothing to do with it.
1564640	1565640	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too.
1565640	1570440	I mean, unless they can prove that Nintendo somehow sponsored this contest, which I doubt,
1570440	1574800	I highly, highly, highly doubt they would sponsor a contest called Hold Your Wee for
1574800	1575800	a Wee.
1575800	1577480	They would have never done that, okay?
1577480	1583320	So unless they can somehow prove that Nintendo sponsored this contest, I don't see that really
1583320	1586480	happening, that they're going to be able to sue them, but maybe that's what they're exploring
1586480	1587480	right now.
1587480	1588480	I don't know.
1588480	1591840	I don't know if Nintendo's a large company, and he thinks that he can get money from them,
1591840	1594840	so it makes perfect sense that they would want to do that.
1594840	1595840	Same with Justin Timberlake.
1595840	1601120	You know, the guy's got money, so let's try to get a piece of it, a piece of the money.
1601120	1606080	Because the station, I mean, granted, the station's probably part of a big network,
1606080	1607400	maybe not so much money there.
1607400	1608400	I don't know.
1608400	1611440	And although I can understand where her family's coming from, I mean, it was very tragic what
1611440	1617240	happened to her, although I do believe she is partially to blame, I felt she was more
1617240	1619840	to blame until I heard the audio of the whole thing.
1619840	1624480	When I heard how crass the DJs were and talking about, you know, well, they signed waivers,
1624480	1626600	what's the worst thing about it, and the fact that people had called them.
1626600	1630520	I had a co-worker who listened to it, and she was telling me at work about how the one
1630520	1632800	doctor we all heard about was not the only one to call in.
1632800	1637420	She said at least two doctors called in telling them not to do it, and they still continued
1637420	1638420	to do it anyway.
1638420	1643120	So while, yeah, I kind of fault her for participating, I think there's blame.
1643120	1644120	It's just tragic.
1644120	1645280	The whole thing's tragic.
1645280	1652560	I think, first of all, she deserves a Darwin Award, and too bad she's already bred.
1652560	1658600	Any person with a brain in their head would know that you cannot hold your urine that
1658600	1659600	long.
1659600	1662520	It is, you're holding a toxin in your body.
1662520	1665040	You can't drink that much water.
1665040	1667760	Now, she deserves her Darwin Award.
1667760	1674440	The DJs also, I think, were responsible for not thinking it through, for being pretty
1674440	1676320	much, yeah, they were idiots.
1676320	1680920	They also deserved to be Darwinized, unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.
1680920	1686880	But I don't think in kind of and sort of, I believe in every party was at fault.
1686880	1687880	She was at fault.
1687880	1689060	She deserves it.
1689060	1690060	They were at fault.
1690060	1691720	They deserve to be fired and worse.
1691720	1693320	I don't think anyone deserves to die.
1693320	1696280	I mean, we all do stupid shit for our kids.
1696280	1697500	But you know what I mean, though?
1697500	1699840	She earned her death.
1699840	1705280	I just kind of think maybe she had some type of trust in the radio station that she wasn't
1705280	1708720	doing it like that they hadn't already researched.
1708720	1713760	They probably didn't know that it was, I mean, because it's basically okay who can hold it
1713760	1716000	the longest and before they have to go.
1716000	1717000	That wasn't the issue.
1717000	1722160	It wasn't because she held back her urine that she died, it was because she drank gallons
1722160	1726560	and gallons of water really quick, and it wouldn't have mattered even if she went afterwards
1726560	1730680	because I'm assuming she did go afterwards, the damage was already done.
1730680	1733440	The thing is, is now they had them fill out waivers.
1733440	1737460	Well, they have generic waivers that the radio stations have people fill out for their contests.
1737460	1740600	It's basically saying, oh, we don't hold you liable for this and this.
1740600	1745360	But they didn't disclose, at least it seems like from what I've heard on the radio and
1745360	1751620	stuff, the recordings of it, they didn't really disclose what possible dangers were and say,
1751620	1756000	you might die from this if there's too much or something like that.
1756000	1759760	I don't think they did their research, or if they did, they just completely shrugged
1759760	1761160	it off.
1761160	1762720	That's really what the issue is.
1762720	1766820	It's not a matter of if they signed waivers or not, it's just they didn't disclose the
1766820	1772800	possible risks of participating in this activity because not everyone is aware that drinking
1772800	1774820	that much water could cause you to die.
1774820	1779840	You would just think that you just have to really go to the bathroom really bad.
1779840	1784880	With a lot of these people not knowing, you can't really hold them responsible for that.
1784880	1788840	Granted, it's a stupid thing, but hey, if someone gave me the opportunity to drink some
1788840	1795480	water and hold my pee for a $250 thing, sure, I'd give it a shot, but if I started feeling
1795480	1799360	sick, I would stop.
1799360	1801400	I think that kind of thing doesn't make you feel sick.
1801400	1802440	That's kind of the difference there.
1802440	1803440	I don't know.
1803440	1804440	Miklotov?
1804440	1808840	I thought they said that she stopped when she did feel sick.
1808840	1812120	She did re-quit the contest.
1812120	1814640	When I read about it, I didn't know about water poisoning.
1814640	1816800	I was like, okay, that's crazy.
1816800	1819200	How could you not know about it?
1819200	1821900	You can drink so much water that it kills you.
1821900	1823320	You're pretty much saturating.
1823320	1827760	But it being a radio contest, I thought they would have taken the precautions to warn the
1827760	1831920	contestants and stuff, or at least have somebody on hand.
1831920	1835920	I'm not saying at all that the DJs in the station were not at fault.
1835920	1839880	I'm saying that there's equal fault.
1839880	1844640	Maybe everybody doesn't know that you can drink yourself of water to death.
1844640	1845960	I thought it was common sense.
1845960	1847600	Interesting perspective in the chat room.
1847600	1851520	Mike W. says, Dark Soccer, it's not the DJ's fault for doing what his boss told him.
1851520	1855080	I do agree to an extent, and that's why 10 people were fired over this.
1855080	1858000	That's why certainly a lot of people, not just the DJs, were fired.
1858000	1862280	But I'm telling you, if you listen to the audio, which is available on one of our local
1862280	1868160	newspapers, sacb.com, has audio of the whole thing, and you listen to the DJs kind of going
1868160	1874080	like, wow, you've got a really big belly, and knowing the result, you can't help but
1874080	1882400	feel like, whoa, they were way too bold for the whole thing.
1882400	1892060	My whole point is that anything that's going to affect the body, you really, really need
1892060	1895320	to understand what the risks are before you decide to do it.
1895320	1896320	That's my point.
1896320	1903200	It came out more harshly than I intended it to, but I think, and I'm not saying anyone
1903200	1908400	deserves to die, but I'm saying that if you die of your own ignorance, then that is on
1908400	1909400	you.
1909400	1910400	I'm sorry.
1910400	1915360	But they did have, and I think that they should have been more than fired.
1915360	1917800	I think they really need to stand trial for it.
1917800	1922960	But I think that those that were in charge of the contest, they had a duty to make sure
1922960	1925680	that the risks were put out there.
1925680	1929680	I guess for the people who don't have common knowledge of this.
1929680	1930680	All right.
1930680	1932280	Well, we could talk for hours and hours about this.
1932280	1933480	Hell, we did on Wednesday's show.
1933480	1935240	We talked for at least an hour about this.
1935240	1938460	But in the interest of getting more news, I'm directly involved with gaming.
1938460	1939760	We do want to move on.
1939760	1943600	We do welcome your emails and voicemails on this topic, but please keep in mind, since
1943600	1947160	this is a controversial issue, we're probably not going to get to read everything we get
1947160	1948160	on it.
1948160	1949360	But we do welcome your thoughts.
1949360	1955400	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com or our voicemail, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1955400	1959760	Let's move on and talk about some news that is definitely directly about gaming.
1959760	1961000	Who's got something for us?
1961000	1962000	I do.
1962000	1963000	All right.
1963000	1964000	We're going to talk about some dates here.
1964000	1968280	We had a lot piling up actually in the last two weeks and even some stuff we announced
1968280	1972920	on the site a little bit, but yet no one seems to be picking up on that.
1972920	1978360	Lots of stuff being announced this week, especially on all the big sites.
1978360	1983080	They were announcing a crazy taxi for the PSP, not a big surprise, and that's coming
1983080	1985020	June 13th.
1985020	1992400	Some other stuff, Two Worlds, the PS3 version, I guess, is being delayed to October 10th
1992400	1998040	and then the Xbox 360 one will be coming out in May on the 16th.
1998040	2000280	So that's some stuff that we probably already knew about.
2000280	2004520	However, there are a lot of things that many people haven't heard about yet and some stuff
2004520	2007020	that's a little bit surprising.
2007020	2017000	First off here, we've got a bunch of no-brainer titles like a new bunch of movie-based stuff.
2017000	2025000	Ratatouille for pretty much every system out there except for the original Xbox to tie
2025000	2028600	in with the upcoming Pixar movie.
2028600	2034440	Of course, we've got Surf's Up also tying with the new movie coming out and that's coming
2034440	2036400	out in May.
2036400	2042520	What's interesting though, beyond all that stuff and like Spider-Man 3 and Transformers
2042520	2047960	and Shrek the Third, we do have some interesting stuff like Dog Island.
2047960	2052760	I don't know if you remember when they were first showing off the Wii stuff in Japan.
2052760	2056960	I thought it was a Hudson game but it's basically that character, the dog, where they have the
2056960	2064680	super giant heads, kind of almost like, I don't know, some sort of toy thing over there.
2064680	2069640	That's coming out on PlayStation 2 and the Wii, May 23rd, which is kind of interesting.
2069640	2074040	Some bigger stuff though, Final Fantasy Fables, Chocable Tales, that's going to be coming
2074040	2076800	out on the DS April 25th.
2076800	2083200	Dawn of Mana, finally making its way out to the PlayStation 2, that's May 15th.
2083200	2087680	And then of course Guitar Hero 2 for the 360 is going to be coming out at the end of March
2087680	2091520	on the 28th and that's pretty big.
2091520	2097360	And then some other interesting stuff, Motorstorm, MLB 07 The Show, and God of War 2 have all
2097360	2102240	been delayed a month to March 14th now.
2102240	2104580	So that's kind of interesting.
2104580	2107400	Same with F.E.A.R. also got delayed to that time.
2107400	2110960	And then of course the big one that we announced on the site, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic
2110960	2117540	has been announced for the Xbox 360 and I know that was something that was being rumored
2117540	2123280	to have happened ever since, actually before the 360 even came out, so it's kind of interesting
2123280	2125680	there.
2125680	2132200	And let's see, and then other interesting stuff, Samurai Slash, which would be Samurai
2132200	2137560	Warriors, the Koei game, coming to the Wii and that's going to be May 16th.
2137560	2145520	Fatal Inertia, Blade Storm, also coming out on the 360 and the PlayStation 3, April 18th,
2145520	2152160	which Koei actually came out and officially said Summer, but April 18th is more accurate.
2152160	2157640	Kane and Lynch, now this one I'm kind of shaking my head with, because I thought it was PlayStation
2157640	2163200	3 and the 360, but we have an announcement for PlayStation 2 and the 360, so I don't know,
2163200	2164700	but that's interesting.
2164700	2172420	June 20th for that one, and then that's probably all the big stuff I would say.
2172420	2173420	Just lots of dates.
2173420	2176880	I'm going to post more on that under the radar thread though, if you want to check out the
2176880	2177880	details there.
2177880	2180160	You should be posting some of that to the front page, really.
2180160	2183200	I've not heard of God of War being pushed back, that's news to me.
2183200	2185800	Of course, I haven't been following for that story very closely.
2185800	2191720	This one's kind of cool too, Senko no Rondo, for the 360, it's an Ikaruga style shooter.
2191720	2198520	That's coming out May 16th as well, so yeah, lots of big stuff.
2198520	2203040	Alright, well thanks for the insight, how about some, what's coming out next week?
2203040	2209120	Yeah, not much, not much of anything actually.
2209120	2212360	Next week is a bunch of portable games, and that's pretty much it.
2212360	2222400	Let's see here, I know we've got the, what is it, Hotel 219, 213, my mistake.
2222400	2224840	That's going to be coming out on the DS.
2224840	2229160	Miggletop, you've been talking to me about this game a lot today, why are you so excited
2229160	2230160	about it?
2230160	2233880	There's a lot of people that do Trace Memory, and I love Trace Memory for the two hours
2233880	2241640	that you get to play it for, and it's just like a film noir looking, oh it's 215, it's
2241640	2247000	just like a film noir thing where you're like some detective guy and you hold your DS like
2247000	2248000	book style.
2248000	2249000	Like brain training?
2249000	2252760	Yeah, and it's just an adventure game, it's great.
2252760	2253760	Okay.
2253760	2260280	And other stuff on the PSP, Legend of Heroes 3, Song of the Ocean, which is another edition
2260280	2266520	of the RPG series, Inuyasha Secret of the Divine Jewel on the DS, Sid Meier's Pirates
2266520	2275520	on the PSP, and then some PC stuff, of course we've got Europa Universal's 3, another strategy
2275520	2282040	game, and Alien Shooter Vengeance on the PC, and then Sam and Max Episode 3, The Mole,
2282040	2284640	The Mob, and The Meatball.
2284640	2286840	More episodic content for you.
2286840	2287840	Alright.
2287840	2293520	Well, I have our UK release dates, if anybody is interested.
2293520	2302120	On the 26th coming out is Arthur and the Minimoys on DS PC, PSP and GBA and PlayStation 2, Pro
2302120	2310360	Evolution Soccer 6 on DS, Star Fox Command on DS, World Snooker, it says Snooker, Championship
2310360	2319280	2007 on PSP by Sega, SOCOM US Navy Seals combined assault on PlayStation 2, and SOCOM US Navy
2319280	2327920	Seals Fire Team Bravo 2 on PSP, and Wild Arms XF, those last three are all on the 27th,
2327920	2330960	and Wild Arms XF is pretty cool.
2330960	2333280	So those are coming out.
2333280	2334280	Very cool.
2334280	2338200	You know, speaking of UK, you know our opening story, the controversial one this evening,
2338200	2340820	you know how I knew that was big news?
2340820	2348940	When I saw it on BBC News, that's when I was like, wow, if you didn't know about the don't
2348940	2352920	drink water and don't go to the bathroom thing before, you sure as hell will now, everybody
2352920	2353920	in the world will know it.
2353920	2360440	It's something else, especially when people are making jokes about it, and they can't
2360440	2364980	revert back to that story, got to move on to dates, because the folks in Japan want
2364980	2367080	to know what's coming out over there.
2367080	2370820	Even if you don't live in Japan, certainly the things that come out in Japan typically
2370820	2375440	will come out here a little later, or sometimes vice versa when the title came out in America
2375440	2379980	first, such as The Godfather, which is now making its way over to Japan on Xbox 360 on
2379980	2387420	January 25th, also coming out The Idolmaster on 360, and Vampire's Reign from AQ Interactive,
2387420	2393380	another title getting localized for Japan from its US release, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw,
2393380	2396080	coming out from THQ this week in Japan.
2396080	2400920	Over on PlayStation 3, Enchanted Arms, or as they call it in Japan, Enchant Arm, coming
2400920	2405500	out January 25th, so it should be interesting to see how that compares to the 360 version.
2405500	2407820	We'll hear a little more about that this week.
2407820	2412520	Also moving on to the Nintendo Wii, there's a Mahjong title, Mahjong Takai Wii, coming
2412520	2416540	out from Koei Entertainment on the 25th in Japan.
2416540	2422700	Over on the PlayStation 2, you get Final Fantasy X International and Final Fantasy X-2 International
2422700	2427420	moving into the Ultimate Hits, that just basically means they get a little bit cheaper.
2427420	2431940	But a big, big title, maybe not so much in Japan as it was here, but Grand Theft Auto
2431940	2433700	San Andreas is coming out.
2433700	2437500	I thought this was interesting from Capcom over in Japan, so it's kind of interesting
2437500	2443700	how things kind of shift around to get releases other places, because that happens sometimes.
2443700	2451100	Capcom also releasing Hyper Street Fighter II, the anniversary collection, and also another
2451100	2455500	big, big title coming out for folks who listen to this program I know for a long time, Dance
2455500	2462740	Dance Revolution Supernova finally getting its Japanese release on the 25th of January.
2462740	2468120	And also coming out for the PS2, its own version of SmackDown vs. Raw, and I like this title.
2468120	2473660	For Marvelous Entertainment, you're getting Kuji Biki Ambulance coming out.
2473660	2481180	Also a Naruto title, Naruto Team at Hero 3 moves into the best collection, because Naruto
2481180	2482180	titles, I guess, sell like crazy.
2482180	2483740	I don't know, I've never played one.
2483740	2490140	On the Nintendo DS, Biohazard Deadly Silence moves into the best price, which, sorry, Deadly
2490140	2491740	Silence, did I say Death Science?
2491740	2494820	Biohazard, of course, is Resident Evil.
2494820	2500940	And P-Cross DS comes out from Nintendo itself over on the Nintendo DS, also another game
2500940	2502340	coming out from Nintendo.
2502340	2508140	Wish Room, Tenshi no Kyoku, coming out this week in Japan.
2508140	2510340	Is that just the hotel game localized over there?
2510340	2511340	Oh, great.
2511340	2513620	And this is pretty cool, Dark Soccer, you'll like this.
2513620	2518340	Coming out on the PSP, Parodius Portable makes its way to the PSP.
2518340	2519580	I know you're a big fan of Parodius.
2519580	2522340	That was like, wasn't that the Parodius collection or something?
2522340	2523460	I believe it is.
2523460	2524460	I believe it is.
2524460	2525460	I love Parodius!
2525460	2526460	Oh, it's interesting.
2526460	2530180	Well, yeah, and also the Salamander collection, Salamander Portable is coming out this week
2530180	2531180	as well.
2531180	2533660	We're just talking about Salamander and Life Force 2 this morning.
2533660	2537660	And Gradius moves into the best, so a big week if you're a Gradius fan over in Japan.
2537660	2542300	So while it may be a slow week here in the U.S. and U.K., it's a busy week over there
2542300	2543300	in Japan.
2543300	2549500	I'd like to mention, though, this week they did announce, or it was on all the other sites
2549500	2552820	out there, that Driver was making its way to the Wii.
2552820	2555820	I just thought that was funny as well.
2555820	2558420	And that's what you had mentioned here on this program about five weeks ago, right?
2558420	2559420	Yeah, something like that.
2559420	2560420	I'm just curious.
2560420	2564540	You know, we do report a lot of these dates and no one seems to pick up onto it until
2564540	2568420	there is an official press release, so I told you so.
2568420	2571420	Shadow Charlie seems to enjoy Parodius as well.
2571420	2575380	Parodius has some badass music, says Shadow Charlie.
2575380	2578380	And Shadow Charlie also wants to know, is DDR Universe out yet?
2578380	2579900	And the answer is no.
2579900	2583840	So those that were thinking it's coming out in January, looks like it really was March.
2583840	2586940	After all, Loki wins again.
2586940	2592180	Well, we have a little bit more news as far as things that are going to be playable this
2592180	2593180	year.
2593180	2595940	The Final Fantasy XIII demo is due out.
2595940	2601420	They said ready for E3 in 2007.
2601420	2606900	I'm not sure which one I guess they mean, because given that there's multiple Final
2606900	2614980	Fantasy XIIIs going on, two of them going on with Squeenix, I'm not sure if they mean
2614980	2616940	both or just one or the other of them.
2616940	2621300	They should do 13 versions of that, you know, that would make sense.
2621300	2622300	They probably will eventually.
2622300	2623300	That would make me cry.
2623300	2627260	We've already got, what, 13 versions of Final Fantasy VII, practically.
2627260	2629620	I don't even feel like counting.
2629620	2634740	Or 13 versions of Final Fantasy I, as we're going to find out later in the program.
2634740	2639700	But at any rate, the two are going to...
2639700	2645420	I love Latin, fabula nova crystallis, that just sounds cool, the new tale of the crystal.
2645420	2647220	Pretty cool.
2647220	2652180	Kind of interesting, especially when folks are saying that the PlayStation 3 really needs
2652180	2654140	like its big title right now.
2654140	2658060	So it's kind of interesting how this Final Fantasy XIII news is kind of slowly leaking
2658060	2659060	out, right?
2659060	2660580	Well, you know what they need?
2660580	2662500	It's just like Final Fantasy VII for the PlayStation.
2662500	2664780	I mean, hell, I bought that system for that game.
2664780	2665780	That's true.
2665780	2667580	I did not buy a PlayStation until Final Fantasy VII.
2667580	2671860	And you know what, I have to admit, Final Fantasy XIII, especially depending on this
2671860	2676420	demo after I play the demo, will probably be the thing that finally breaks me to get
2676420	2677420	a PlayStation 3.
2677420	2681020	Because I'm the only OLR host that doesn't own one.
2681020	2682420	But I'm poor.
2682420	2685820	Anyways, so more on Final Fantasy XIII.
2685820	2689420	It's been leaked out by Famitsu and Dengeki.
2689420	2695100	Some stuff they're talking about, I guess, from the playable demo, including apparently
2695100	2700540	it's going to have a really awesome opening scene that says probably the most intense
2700540	2705940	in the Final Fantasy series, which seems to be like every other game does that.
2705940	2710820	And then, of course, they were talking about, I guess, one of the main characters, the blonde
2710820	2713260	guy that you see in all the trailers.
2713260	2715500	Apparently it's going to be pretty big.
2715500	2718860	He's going to be large enough to run around carrying two people.
2718860	2720780	And they said his shoe size will be 33 centimeters.
2720780	2723020	I wonder what the fuck that's supposed to mean.
2723020	2725740	Who gives a shit about fictional characters' shoe sizes?
2725740	2728820	I guess that means his penis is going to be huge too.
2728820	2729820	But whatever.
2729820	2735740	So hopefully we'll get some more important information on Final Fantasy XIII coming soon,
2735740	2738220	other than shoe sizes.
2738220	2739220	We need bust sizes.
2739220	2740220	That's what we need.
2740220	2741220	Where's that information?
2741220	2745820	Well, I'm definitely looking forward to more and more information on Final Fantasy XIII.
2745820	2751900	Being the self-confessed Final Fantasy fanboy I am, I'm personally very excited for all
2751900	2752900	the latest.
2752900	2756040	We'll see hopefully more in the next few weeks.
2756040	2758980	More things that Japan is seeing is apparently PlayStation 3.
2758980	2763740	Sony put out a release this week that says they have sold one million of the machines.
2763740	2764740	I'm sorry.
2764740	2765740	I'm sorry.
2765740	2766740	Wait.
2766740	2767740	Key difference here.
2767740	2768740	They have shipped one million machines in Japan.
2768740	2769740	Sorry there.
2769740	2770740	I'm so tired of these.
2770740	2771740	See, I almost fell for the trick there.
2771740	2772740	That's what they're trying to get you to think.
2772740	2774700	I am so tired of these fucking companies doing this shit.
2774700	2776220	Oh, we've shipped them.
2776220	2777220	Good for you.
2777220	2778220	I've taken a shit too.
2778220	2779980	I mean, do you want news on that too?
2779980	2783740	I mean, seriously, so you shipped that many.
2783740	2787980	Why don't they say they've manufactured that many or thought about manufacturing that many?
2787980	2793860	It should be interesting to note that Sony only actually sold about 470,000 at the end
2793860	2794860	of 2006.
2794860	2796340	That was their year's end sale figure.
2796340	2799780	So it's kind of interesting that this release comes out now and says, oh, we've actually
2799780	2801220	shipped a million.
2801220	2805860	So does that mean that half of them are sitting on shelves?
2805860	2807300	They're shitting on the seashore.
2807300	2811060	I've got dyslexia of the mouth today.
2811060	2812060	I don't know what it is.
2812060	2813780	I'm combining words that don't need to be combined.
2813780	2814900	I don't know what's wrong today.
2814900	2816900	I apologize, folks.
2816900	2819940	Amateur radio at its finest.
2819940	2823460	Maybe this is why we don't get paid to do what we do.
2823460	2831180	Should you have a half a million of them sitting on the store shelves or have they moved a
2831180	2834540	whole bunch in the last two weeks that they've now shipped more to compensate for that?
2834540	2835540	I don't really know.
2835540	2836540	You have to understand.
2836540	2842620	They've moved more units to the stores to allow for more elaborate towers to be made
2842620	2850820	out of the units that no one's buying, including castles and the traditional Christmas tree
2850820	2853460	tower type thing.
2853460	2858260	It should be noted that now they have achieved their goal of shipping two million units worldwide
2858260	2863700	about two weeks late from the deadline, but keep in mind that was a goal that got smaller
2863700	2865020	and smaller before the PS3's release.
2865020	2867420	Wasn't there gold to sell that many units?
2867420	2868700	I don't know.
2868700	2873460	So now they're saying six million at the end of March they will ship.
2873460	2880060	I'm glad to see that they were able to hit their twice-adjusted goal two weeks late.
2880060	2881060	Way to go, Sony.
2881060	2883260	Hey, look, I don't write it.
2883260	2884260	I just report on it.
2884260	2885380	There you go.
2885380	2887180	I don't know what else to tell you.
2887180	2888540	I know what else to tell people.
2888540	2889540	What's that?
2889540	2896220	Apparently, it's been listed that the PlayStation 3 is going to be more expensive in Ireland,
2896220	2899340	and I don't know why.
2899340	2906620	It was actually listed on This Is Living that the price of the PlayStation 3 in Ireland
2906620	2916100	is going to be 629.99 euros instead of the announced stuff, 5.99.
2916100	2925580	The speculation is that it actually is going to be an increase all over Europe, but just
2925580	2929180	that Ireland got the update first.
2929180	2934820	I really hope that it's not true, that they keep it the 5.99 because that's going to piss
2934820	2936060	off a lot of people.
2936060	2940420	I heard it was because of the higher VAT prices in Ireland.
2940420	2944180	Now Seisha is one of our UK listeners, and he's in chat right now saying it's not just
2944180	2948300	Ireland but the entirety of the UK as well.
2948300	2960820	Has Sony even officially confirmed anything?
2960820	2964540	We still don't have a firm date for the UK, do we?
2964540	2968180	They've confirmed non-confirmation.
2968180	2971700	So does this mean we don't really know anything, or what's it boiled down to?
2971700	2977820	It means that they're shipping units some day, some amount.
2977820	2982460	Actually, there is a posted update.
2982460	2985740	That's exactly why it did increase.
2985740	2993580	For the rest of everybody else, it's going to be 5.99 for the 60 and 4.25 for the...
2993580	2995660	Damn you Ireland, setting the bar for everyone else.
2995660	2997300	Just buy the 20.
2997300	2999300	You really don't need the 60.
2999300	3000300	Really?
3000300	3001300	I have the 60.
3001300	3002300	It's on HDMI.
3002300	3006140	So is HDMI that important, what do you guys think?
3006140	3007780	It's on both units.
3007780	3010260	I thought that was a big thing, that it wasn't going to be on the 20 gig.
3010260	3011540	Yeah, then they changed that.
3011540	3012540	Really?
3012540	3013540	Yeah, it's on both units.
3013540	3014540	I didn't get that memo.
3014540	3015540	Oh, it's still stupid.
3015540	3016540	I have the 60 and I like it.
3016540	3017540	Oh, we'll see.
3017540	3018540	I don't know.
3018540	3022420	I'm running out of room on the 360 with the 20 gig, so maybe I want...
3022420	3023420	Well, you can always upgrade, remember?
3023420	3024420	Nah, we'll see.
3024420	3025420	I don't know.
3025420	3029380	Of course, those hard drives, the two and a half inch SATA drives are fucking expensive,
3029380	3030380	but whatever.
3030380	3031380	I have no decision on what I want to do yet.
3031380	3032380	I'm too poor.
3032380	3033380	I know that much.
3033380	3038740	But you know, one reason you might want to upgrade that 2.5 inch SATA drive in your PS3
3038740	3044500	is to run MythTV on it, because if you install the second operating system or Linux on your
3044500	3050060	other partition, there is actually a way now to get MythTV to run.
3050060	3058120	Using a USB TV tuner and a wonderful set of homemade drivers for it, you too can run the
3058120	3064580	wonderful TVR software to be able to record your favorite shows and dump them onto your
3064580	3069340	hopefully larger hard drive, so that's pretty cool.
3069340	3071780	And I don't know.
3071780	3075780	I might try that, since I don't really have room on my other drive, although I need to
3075780	3080100	get a capture card for that, but hey, that's great.
3080100	3086300	Well, from one TV-enabled system to another, let's go over to Microsoft IPTV.
3086300	3090740	Of course, this was announced at CES, and details are starting to fill in.
3090740	3096500	I have a lengthy quote here from the Microsoft TV site of what exactly this thing does.
3096500	3101700	Quote, Microsoft IPTV edition is an integrated and comprehensive software platform developed
3101700	3106020	specifically to deliver broadcast quality video and new integrated TV services over
3106020	3107420	broadband networks.
3107420	3112340	The platform combines market-leading features such as instant channel change, ICC, and multiple
3112340	3120020	picture-in-picture with traditional TV services such as broadcast, programming, VOD, and DVR.
3120020	3124660	The software is developed to integrate seamlessly and economically with other IP-based communications
3124660	3128900	and media services for PCs, phones, and other consumer devices.
3128900	3134580	Microsoft IPTV edition is ideal for telecommunications carriers and for cable operators looking to
3134580	3138560	deliver differentiated TV services and experiences.
3138560	3141740	And for what I've been picking else out there on the Internet, it does sound like if you
3141740	3146300	want to have this, this is not just something you're going to simply download it or just
3146300	3149620	plug on to your Xbox 360 and boom, you get TV through your 360.
3149620	3150620	Oh, no, no, no, no.
3150620	3156020	You're going to have to switch up your cable provider who therefore will also provide your
3156020	3157660	Internet and so on and so on.
3157660	3162780	You're really going to have to make an adjustment change when it comes to how your services
3162780	3167580	such as Internet and TV are provided in your house.
3167580	3171740	If people are thinking, oh, this is just some cool little enhancement of 360, it's a little
3171740	3173340	more than that.
3173340	3180200	It kind of makes me think almost like Microsoft is now becoming like a rival to satellite
3180200	3181200	in a way.
3181200	3182200	I don't know.
3182200	3183200	Maybe that's a little bit far-fetched.
3183200	3184200	It's not the best way to phrase it.
3184200	3185200	I don't know.
3185200	3186200	What do you guys think?
3186200	3187200	Is this something you might be interested in checking out?
3187200	3188940	I want to check it out, definitely.
3188940	3189940	Would you make that change?
3189940	3191940	Would you get rid of what you have now for this?
3191940	3192940	What I have?
3192940	3193940	Yeah.
3193940	3195060	Cable is fucking too expensive.
3195060	3198300	If it had some good programming on it, hell yeah.
3198300	3202700	If it had everything, although I imagine IPTV doesn't probably have everything, yeah, it
3202700	3206580	might have some specific channels.
3206580	3214420	If anything, it would be a good addition to if not replacing my current TV, although my
3214420	3217740	current TV is expensive and I hate it.
3217740	3221340	I'm looking at some comments from Chat Room, chat.orangelunge.com.
3221340	3224260	Black Boy says, basically the 360 becomes a cable box.
3224260	3226540	I guess that's one way you can think of it.
3226540	3231580	I think it's a waste.
3231580	3235140	This is Microsoft doing the Trojan horse thing and they've openly admitted that they did
3235140	3242000	not put out the 360 to do just gaming and now it sounds to me like cable versus satellite
3242000	3243580	versus the 360.
3243580	3249220	Or you can do what I do and that's not watch TV and get a life.
3249220	3250460	You watch Doctor Who.
3250460	3255100	I download it off the internet, watch it at my convenience and then go outside.
3255100	3257460	So there is some television you watch, at least one thing.
3257460	3258460	But I don't use my television.
3258460	3259500	And Torchwood, you watch that too.
3259500	3261380	I don't need cable.
3261380	3266180	But with the IPTV, granted you don't live in the UK, if there were any U.S. shows that
3266180	3268980	you watched, I know they re-brought Heroes tomorrow.
3268980	3271980	At all worth watching on television in the United States.
3271980	3275420	Are you going to watch Heroes tomorrow with Doctor Nine?
3275420	3276420	Probably not actually.
3276420	3278340	I'm going to be in school.
3278340	3279340	Let me down.
3279340	3283020	I'll watch the other episodes and then watch that at my own convenience.
3283020	3284020	All right.
3284020	3285020	All right, whatever.
3285020	3288380	There's no way we move over.
3288380	3294300	The thing is I don't see why people are so obsessed with television anyway.
3294300	3296700	People get obsessed over movies.
3296700	3298620	Silent Hill, Jamie.
3298620	3302180	I saw it four times and then they saw it.
3302180	3303820	So it's just another type of entertainment.
3303820	3307020	It was another thing that was at my convenience.
3307020	3312380	I think if I got anything for TV, I'd definitely have a DVR, but other than that.
3312380	3316660	And then that's kind of what IPTV is, DVR, video on demand, all that crap.
3316660	3322300	I just don't think that we need anything else contributing to the couch potato mentality.
3322300	3324540	But there are educational things on TV.
3324540	3327640	Heck, over at Loki's last night we were watching on Discovery Health, this whole special on
3327640	3329900	people going through transgender surgery.
3329900	3334460	And there was this post-op chick who was walking around with a shirt off on the beach, looked
3334460	3335700	just like a dude.
3335700	3337020	Very educational.
3337020	3338020	Very educational.
3338020	3341860	There's also make YouTube that has all that on it too.
3341860	3344740	And I can go to school.
3344740	3346540	Something else I wanted to mention.
3346540	3348620	Somebody was saying they weren't interested.
3348620	3352420	JV Mon in chat says, IPTV seems unattractive to me.
3352420	3354900	I feel like I don't know enough about it yet.
3354900	3359620	I realize CES is kind of a very high level thing for tech heads and things of that nature.
3359620	3363140	I need a brochure that's dumbed down for me to explain exactly what I'm going to have
3363140	3367540	to change and what I'm going to have to pay to get this and why I should do it.
3367540	3369260	But again, for me it comes down to channels.
3369260	3374320	If it had some pretty good HD channels, because that's what my current cable provider is severely
3374320	3378260	lacking is we have like five HD channels and there's way more out there.
3378260	3381900	I know there's others out there and HD is pretty.
3381900	3384020	Raven's Dolphin agrees with the YouTube thing.
3384020	3386020	Long live YouTube.
3386020	3389300	There you go.
3389300	3399700	Moving on, we watched YouTube last night on the Wii and laser cats.
3399700	3403860	We were watching Jesus Christ Super Cop today on the Wii.
3403860	3408380	They were watching some spider video where somebody dubbed over one of those Discovery
3408380	3412540	Channel things on spiders and made it sound like one spider got a restraining order on
3412540	3413540	the other.
3413540	3414540	I don't know.
3414540	3415540	I only watched like five minutes.
3415540	3416540	What happens when spiders are on drugs?
3416540	3417540	So how about some Halo?
3417540	3418540	Yeah, how about some Halo?
3418540	3422540	They have actually released some details about the assault rifle, which I guess some people
3422540	3424860	care about.
3424860	3434420	The assault rifle in Halo 3 is the MA-5C assault rifle that is a return of one that they removed
3434420	3435420	from Halo 2.
3435420	3437780	They didn't have any Halo 2.
3437780	3442300	The power level is going to be somewhere between the original one and the BR-55 battle rifle
3442300	3443940	from Halo 2.
3443940	3446900	You can use the butt as a melee weapon apart from that.
3446900	3452220	Just the thing that I thought was very funny is how they described it was the MA-5C is
3452220	3455300	built like a breakout house with Venetian blinds.
3455300	3456820	That just made me laugh.
3456820	3460020	Are you going to play some Halo 3 Dark Sakura?
3460020	3462020	No, get motion sick.
3462020	3464700	But you get to blow stuff up?
3464700	3468460	Yeah, I can play Bomberman.
3468460	3469460	I don't know.
3469460	3474280	The thing is that I really don't have to play these games because Dan plays them and I could
3474280	3479940	go read a book and hear the explosions while I'm reading my book.
3479940	3481340	I get the best of both worlds.
3481340	3487460	Sometimes I wonder why you're on this program, but then I remember there are those cutesy
3487460	3494740	games that you are into that none of the rest of us have heard of, so I guess there's that.
3494740	3497300	The Halo franchise really isn't that bad.
3497300	3501820	It's just that it's not my thing.
3501820	3506180	That's understandable because I know a lot of people who aren't into Halo, but me?
3506180	3507580	I've been getting back into Halo 2 lately.
3507580	3510980	I did try.
3510980	3515940	If somebody I know is into a game, I think that it's worth playing once before I reserve
3515940	3520680	my judgment for it, but I have the same problem with that that I found out a long time ago
3520680	3525260	that I have with Goldeneye with almost any first person shooter.
3525260	3528660	It makes me so motion sick that I can't.
3528660	3530380	Katamari makes me motion sick.
3530380	3535020	However, it's on crack and has enough in it that makes me be able to stand playing a couple
3535020	3536020	of games.
3536020	3543460	Can you imagine how insane Katamari would be if the Sonic team was behind it?
3543460	3545620	That would be super fast.
3545620	3547260	No, because they'd fuck it up.
3547260	3548260	Oh, that's right.
3548260	3549700	You wouldn't be able to control it correctly.
3549700	3550700	Exactly.
3550700	3551700	No, no, no, no.
3551700	3557140	I think the Sonic team debate will go for another show.
3557140	3563340	Anywho, as if it's a huge surprise or anything, because I know it's not for me.
3563340	3568140	The Halo 3 beta, since it's being included in Crackdown, well, they've sold about another
3568140	3571500	25% more of Crackdown than they would have normally had.
3571500	3573580	Yeah, big surprise there.
3573580	3577220	People aren't going to buy Crackdown just because of the Halo 3 beta in there.
3577220	3579780	To be honest though, Crackdown's an awesome game.
3579780	3583620	The demo's coming out on Tuesday, so I highly recommend checking it out if you have Xbox
3583620	3589100	Live, definitely worth it.
3589100	3594420	As Loki previously reported, Major Nelson confirmed that Crackdown demo will be hitting
3594420	3599220	Xbox Live on Tuesday, and Loki gets a big finger from me for stealing my story.
3599220	3600440	Thanks a lot.
3600440	3603220	Check it out, Tuesday at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.
3603220	3607180	But I guess I could take this opportunity to point out, he doesn't often announce demos
3607180	3612320	in advance, so usually they announce them once they've already hit or news leaks out
3612320	3617220	and most Microsoft rumors are true anyway, so I don't know.
3617220	3620980	But regardless, since I don't know much about Crackdown, but I keep hearing Loki rave about
3620980	3624300	it, which is fascinating because he's never played it, I definitely want to check out
3624300	3625300	the demo.
3625300	3628540	It's like Grand Theft Auto, but okay, here's why Crackdown's awesome.
3628540	3633020	It's like Grand Theft Auto, but you're like a super-powered hero guy, and basically you
3633020	3637580	can, for example, kill somebody, throw them in the air, fire rockets, and juggle them
3637580	3638900	off the rockets in the air.
3638900	3640300	You can get achievements for that, by the way.
3640300	3645660	You can jump from buildings, you know, building to building, you can throw cars at people.
3645660	3649500	When you get into a car, it becomes like the super-charged Batmobile type thing.
3649500	3652020	Can you sleep with a hooker, then shoot them?
3652020	3653460	I don't know if you can sleep with hookers.
3653460	3654460	Not interested.
3654460	3657260	But you can probably throw hookers in the buildings, and that's just as cool.
3657260	3660260	Okay, now my interest is back, we'll see.
3660260	3662700	It's got two-player co-op over live.
3662700	3663700	Okay, alright.
3663700	3664700	See, that would be fun.
3664700	3668860	I will check out the demo just for you, Loki, and give my thoughts on next week's edition.
3668860	3670380	We'll play multiplayer.
3670380	3672660	Alright, will the demo have multiplayer?
3672660	3673660	Yes.
3673660	3674660	Oh, sweet!
3674660	3675660	I'm all about that.
3675660	3676660	Can I throw you into a building?
3676660	3677980	Because I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
3677980	3678980	Maybe.
3678980	3679980	Alright!
3679980	3680980	Sign me up!
3680980	3681980	I should pre-order it tomorrow.
3681980	3686220	Then I can be in the Halo 3 beta, like all the cool kids.
3686220	3689900	You can be in the cool kids club for lots of other things, Rob.
3689900	3690900	Like what?
3690900	3697360	Um, like your idea for getting fast passes while we were in the line for Space Mountain.
3697360	3698360	So we could ride it again?
3698360	3699360	Yeah, I know.
3699360	3702220	And then getting fast passes for when we go back for my birthday.
3702220	3703220	I'm smart.
3703220	3704220	I'm smart like that.
3704220	3707820	Well, here's some cool stuff.
3707820	3719180	For anyone who is into Luminous Live, there will be three goodies coming out on Wednesday.
3719180	3723520	It's actually three downloadable packages that are going to be available January 24th
3723520	3728820	at 1 a.m. Pacific time.
3728820	3735260	Two of them are add-on packs, and then there's one for free, but only for Xbox Live Gold
3735260	3736260	members.
3736260	3737780	That would be the Heavenly Star pack.
3737780	3743060	Yes, which I am so, you know, I would get Luminous Live just to get the Heavenly Star
3743060	3744060	pack.
3744060	3748580	Yes, and this gives me another excuse to play this song on our little program here, a little
3748580	3751620	clip from it, because I freaking love this song, and I think it's going to be awesome
3751620	3752620	to play.
3752620	3753620	That's what I called it.
3753620	3754620	I put it on my Micey.
3754620	3765940	Oh, somebody in chat is saying there's new...
3765940	3769460	Alpha Canagram says, I want the new Genki Rockets remixes on iTunes.
3769460	3770460	What?
3770460	3771460	What?
3771460	3772460	I have iTunes open right now.
3772460	3773460	I'm going to look at that crap.
3773460	3774460	Rob, show.
3774460	3776180	I do not see remixes on iTunes.
3776180	3777180	This is lies.
3777180	3778180	Lies.
3778180	3780180	Maybe they're in the UK store or something.
3780180	3781180	Show.
3781180	3782180	I don't know.
3782180	3785980	I do want to go back and read some chat comments, some other things in chat.
3785980	3789940	Jeremy Todd 1 was saying about the Crackdown demo, Loki, some people who have played it
3789940	3794380	were saying it's more like Spiderman 2 or that Hulk Ultimate Destruction game more than
3794380	3796900	GTA.
3796900	3799460	And Blaze says, this is how the demo is going to go down.
3799460	3802180	Loki kills everything, Rob goes and picks a flower.
3802180	3804060	Look, screw you, buddy, okay?
3804060	3805060	Look, no.
3805060	3806060	No.
3806060	3809460	When I played the Superman Returns demo, which the only thing I got a thrill out of in that
3809460	3813860	demo was I went and I picked up a woman and then I flew to the beach and left her and
3813860	3814860	I was like, bye, bitch.
3814860	3815860	I flew away.
3815860	3816860	My favorite was that.
3816860	3820700	If you don't think I can be sadistic in those types of games, you are way wrong.
3820700	3822340	You got the wrong impression of me, buddy.
3822340	3823780	You missed the best part in the game, though.
3823780	3828340	You pick up a car and you fly really high because you can't really blow up the car.
3828340	3831740	You could drop the car, though, and then it just falls and explodes.
3831740	3832740	Really?
3832740	3834420	I should re-download the demo just to do that.
3834420	3835420	It's hilarious.
3835420	3836420	I'm not going to buy the game.
3836420	3840460	Do you get achievements, maybe, for that because maybe I could gamefly it or something.
3840460	3841460	I need to get a gamefly account.
3841460	3842460	It's one of those companies.
3842460	3843460	I don't know if I'll go with them.
3843460	3848180	It's a horrible, horrible game, but anyways, one game that's not so horrible, although
3848180	3853340	some people may think it's horrible, is this game called Boom Boom Rocket, which is being
3853340	3856460	put out by Bazaar.
3856460	3863060	It resembles very closely Phantom Vision and actually almost looks like kind of DDR across
3863060	3864060	with Phantom Vision.
3864060	3867300	I'm not sure how you would play the game.
3867300	3868300	I don't know.
3868300	3869300	It looks pretty awesome.
3869300	3875220	You basically will be blowing up fireworks to time with ten original tracks that they're
3875220	3876220	going to be having.
3876220	3882020	It's going to be published by EA and hopefully it will be downloadable soon.
3882020	3883020	So I don't know.
3883020	3886820	It looks pretty cool from the screenshots I've seen of it so far.
3886820	3887820	It looks pretty sexy.
3887820	3888820	I don't know.
3888820	3891220	I heard it just looks like Phantom Vision.
3891220	3893340	Oh, there's actual screenshots of it now?
3893340	3896100	It looks just like Phantom Vision and kind of like DDR.
3896100	3898300	Oh, it does look kind of like DDR.
3898300	3899540	Oh, Jamie can't see.
3899540	3901100	Oh, that looks fun.
3901100	3902100	Show it to Jamie.
3902100	3903100	She can't see.
3903100	3904100	Ooh, explodey.
3904100	3907100	Oh, Miklotov's excited about this?
3907100	3908300	I love Phantom Vision.
3908300	3911140	I think I'm the only person in the world who got the biggest kick out of it.
3911140	3912140	I still have Phantom Vision.
3912140	3913140	It's the best.
3913140	3917260	It was the best launch title and that looks just like it and I can't wait now.
3917260	3921060	It really does look like DDR because there's like this kind of a purple line towards the
3921060	3927940	top of the screen and there's actual looks like the, you know, bursts from the fireworks
3927940	3930820	going up instead of you maybe clicking on them or whatever.
3930820	3936500	They have arrows on them so I think you have to maybe point in the direction of the arrow
3936500	3940380	or something like kind of like DDR and it'll blow them up in time.
3940380	3941380	That's my guess.
3941380	3942380	JV Monn called it.
3942380	3945140	JV Monn said, that will make Miklotov happy.
3945140	3948100	You must talk to him a lot offline or something.
3948100	3949100	All right.
3949100	3951100	Before we get to the next story, I just want to point this out.
3951100	3954980	I wanted to do a quick follow up here on the last story.
3954980	3960540	What I thought was interesting is that somebody pointed me to the MySpace for Genkai Rockets
3960540	3965820	who does Heavenly Star and apparently it is announced on there that there will be five
3965820	3969180	different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon and they have a clip.
3969180	3971180	I'm assuming this is one of them.
3971180	3991100	Ah, forget it, that's just some clip from the radio.
3991100	3993540	Why did they put that on their MySpace?
3993540	3996840	Live radio boys and girls, sorry, I didn't know what I was clicking on but they do say
3996840	4002660	on the MySpace it's written here, five different remixes of Heavenly Star coming soon.
4002660	4008700	Why would they put that clip from a radio show because they want to show that Genkai
4008700	4009700	Rockets is awesome?
4009700	4014620	Why don't they put an MP3 copy of it or something, something that doesn't sound like recorded
4014620	4015620	off radio?
4015620	4018260	Do you think we could get Genkai Rockets on the show?
4018260	4021300	Do you think they speak English?
4021300	4022300	Maybe.
4022300	4023540	I'm going to fire off an email.
4023540	4025020	I'm going to send a message on MySpace.
4025020	4026020	They sing in English.
4026020	4027020	We'll see what happens.
4027020	4029380	Yeah, I guess that's true.
4029380	4036380	Well anyway, speaking of popular music games such as Fantavision and this Boom Boom Rocket
4036380	4042040	thing coming up, one very uber popular music game folks have been following is Guitar Hero.
4042040	4048740	We got a lot of Guitar Hero news for you guys tonight and this story is very interesting.
4048740	4053020	Apparently what's happening now that Activision has acquired Red Octane which happened some
4053020	4056780	time ago, apparently what's happening is that the Guitar Hero franchise is now moving over
4056780	4063500	to the Neversoft branch who makes Tony Hawk's Project 8 and this is confirmed by a screenshot
4063500	4067740	from Neversoft's website where you see Guitar Hero side by side with Tony Hawk's Project
4067740	4068740	8.
4068740	4074140	So it does look like now Guitar Hero 3 will be developed by this Neversoft company.
4074140	4078980	Apparently now this frees up harmonics to work on a rumored sequel to Frequency and
4078980	4083500	Amplitude but as we learned about on a previous program, they were going to put one out on
4083500	4087220	the PSP and it got, I guess, canned.
4087220	4088580	So I don't know what they're working on now.
4088580	4089580	Must be top secret.
4089580	4090580	Who knows?
4090580	4098620	Well, there is actually something interesting going on though.
4098620	4105740	Activision registered trademarks for two new games, Guitar Villain and Drum Villain.
4105740	4110340	The applications are stating that they're both the same thing, computer game software,
4110340	4119020	downloadable software for use in connection with computer games, entertainment services.
4119020	4125660	It seems to me that I think that they're really going to be expanding the franchise.
4125660	4130620	And both of those applications also said that they'd be using toy guitars for video games,
4130620	4136220	toys designed to be used for computer games or video games.
4136220	4137540	The drum one sounds interesting.
4137540	4143620	I'm thinking sort of like what Session Mode was for Drum Mania but also we need to keep
4143620	4152900	in mind in April last year Red Octane placed applications to trademark Drum Hero and Keyboard
4152900	4153900	Hero.
4153900	4154900	So...
4154900	4157140	I haven't seen anything from those yet.
4157140	4158980	No, but it could be...
4158980	4166340	But it is interesting that Konami, who did the Bimani series, had a Guitar Freaks, Drum
4166340	4168020	Mania, and Keyboard Mania.
4168020	4170740	So it's almost kind of mirror image.
4170740	4171740	That's all right.
4171740	4178180	They'll win their awards for Drum Hero and Keyboard Hero and Band Hero and whatever else.
4178180	4179180	It's so innovative.
4179180	4180180	I've never seen that before.
4180180	4181180	Ever.
4181180	4182180	You know what?
4182180	4186620	Konami abandoned Keyboard Mania, therefore I am all about bringing on the Keyboard Hero.
4186620	4187620	That's fine.
4187620	4188620	That's fine.
4188620	4189620	It's fine.
4189620	4190620	That's optional.
4190620	4197980	If they can put jump in Keyboard Hero, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, tell me not everyone would want to play that.
4197980	4198980	Van Halen.
4198980	4199980	Session Van Halen.
4199980	4200980	That would be awesome.
4200980	4201980	Hello?
4201980	4202980	All right.
4202980	4203980	Sorry.
4203980	4205420	What the hell would they do with Guitar Villains anyway?
4205420	4208060	Were there any Guitar Villains?
4208060	4210800	Maybe be like Death Metal Edition.
4210800	4212100	Whatever.
4212100	4214140	I don't know.
4214140	4219720	I just hope they don't really come out and try to say it's original.
4219720	4224760	But what's good about music games though, the sales have been up about 80% probably
4224760	4229900	due to the fact of Guitar Hero 2 coming out since it was one of the top selling games
4229900	4232140	in December.
4232140	4237100	Not a huge surprise, but a lot of people are starting to actually look at music games as
4237100	4246060	possibly a way to get their music heard, including some quotes from former Jane's Addiction
4246060	4251020	and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Dave Navarro, to be featured in a video game is probably
4251020	4257700	the greatest way to reach a large audience right now.
4257700	4262380	I'm not really surprised with good games like Guitar Hero 2 coming out, they're getting
4262380	4267700	a lot more attention than say DDR, because DDR right now, not really that much innovation
4267700	4268700	going on.
4268700	4275620	I will say as much as I love and adore Konami for bringing over Beatmania and DDR, I think
4275620	4279180	this kind of proves they didn't put enough faith in it in the beginning.
4279180	4283340	Now that the games have taken off, other people are getting the credit for it in a way.
4283340	4288720	Obviously the guitar game has been reinvented since then, but I think Konami might be kicking
4288720	4291420	themselves a little bit for not taking a bigger risk and bringing more of those games over
4291420	4292420	here a few years ago.
4292420	4297620	You know, I'm really surprised that with Guitar Hero's success that they haven't jumped to
4297620	4299540	try to bring drum here.
4299540	4305300	Give it time, you never know what might happen.
4305300	4306300	We will see I guess.
4306300	4310540	Yeah, supposedly they're having a big press conference pretty soon, Konami, and apparently
4310540	4313340	we get to go, so we'll have all the latest for you.
4313340	4314340	Apparently.
4314340	4315340	Hopefully.
4315340	4316700	Hopefully we don't get turned down.
4316700	4322180	So we'll have all the latest for you guys here on this program when that happens, which
4322180	4324840	is in a couple weeks.
4324840	4328380	Talking now about the Wii a little bit, because you know one reason that people play dance
4328380	4333420	games is to lose weight, and one thing that has people excited about the Wii is it's got
4333420	4337500	you up and moving around, so can you really lose weight playing the Wii?
4337500	4340420	And you know my kind of reaction when I saw it was like, well not a lot, you're not doing
4340420	4341420	that much motion.
4341420	4345660	You're not supposed to do these grand huge motions, you're only supposed to do little
4345660	4348220	motions with your hand and all that stuff.
4348220	4354940	This website did this Wii Sports experiment, and apparently what they've done here is that
4354940	4359420	they did a 30 day trial of playing the game.
4359420	4365260	They ran, I think they played for 30 days for 30 minutes, and the dude lost like 10
4365260	4366260	pounds.
4366260	4367260	Without changing any diet or anything.
4367260	4368260	No, I'm sorry, it was six weeks.
4368260	4372940	He didn't change any diet or nothing, and in 30 minutes of Wii Sports a day, he lost
4372940	4374460	10 pounds.
4374460	4377980	I would say that's just probably a result of being more active in general, just kind
4377980	4382400	of getting the body moving and waking up the muscles and things, probably a little bit.
4382400	4385540	That's probably it, I mean it's just an increase in activity.
4385540	4389660	If anything I would consider a low impact aerobic.
4389660	4392580	Yeah, it's better than nothing.
4392580	4395260	So you know, cool on that.
4395260	4400480	And that's probably something I need to go on because I've gained a little weight lately
4400480	4403380	and I need to lose it, so maybe I'll go on the Wii diet as well.
4403380	4406860	Because you know, WarioWare has kind of a mode in it that is encouraging the whole weight
4406860	4407860	loss thing.
4407860	4413640	They have a mode that is nothing but games that require big movements.
4413640	4416540	So it's supposed to be a game that really gets you moving around, and I just need to
4416540	4417540	play more DDR.
4417540	4418540	You're just going to go to the gym.
4418540	4421860	And I do need to just go to the gym, but you know my thing with gyms.
4421860	4422860	Gyms are weird places.
4422860	4424660	You can come with me and Extra for on Tuesday.
4424660	4425660	I'll think about it.
4425660	4427860	We'll talk off air.
4427860	4430360	Maybe we'll have a play date, we'll see.
4430360	4434620	Only if we get to, never mind.
4434620	4436100	If we get to go out for ice cream afterwards.
4436100	4438460	Okay, let's get ice cream after the gym.
4438460	4439460	That works for me.
4439460	4441180	That's the kind of reward I need.
4441180	4446060	All right, anyway, one reward we like to give our listeners is reading the stuff they have
4446060	4448120	to write to us on air.
4448120	4450860	And tonight we have our lovely mailbag segment.
4450860	4454980	DarkSakura reads the emails that you send to her at mailbag.orangelaungerator.com live
4454980	4456260	here on the air.
4456260	4458700	And I believe we probably have an Uber mailbag segment tonight, don't we?
4458700	4459700	We probably have a lot.
4459700	4460700	Decent.
4460700	4463540	Once I got rid of the spam, we had a few.
4463540	4464540	All right.
4464540	4466740	Well, let's get to some emails, because I know we probably missed a few while we were
4466740	4469580	out and I want to hear what the folks had to say.
4469580	4473180	So DarkSakura, who emailed us?
4473180	4475300	First email of the night was from Rini.
4475300	4476300	Salutations.
4476300	4479020	I love when an email starts with salutations.
4479020	4480020	That's just awesome.
4480020	4484060	Okay, listen to your last two podcasts of 2006 and we'd like to respond to some items
4484060	4485060	of interest.
4485060	4490660	On your Christmas Eve episode, someone asked why iTunes keeps inexplicably stopping downloads.
4490660	4495060	As much as it pisses me off as well, the only remedy I can offer to iTunes users when you're
4495060	4499780	downloading a podcast, make sure that not only is iTunes in the front most or active
4499780	4505180	application, but that you keep iTunes in its downloads feature up front as well.
4505180	4509180	You do this by starting a download in iTunes, choosing downloads on the sidebar to the left
4509180	4510660	of the iTunes window.
4510660	4511660	Okay.
4511660	4515580	And since iTunes is already being pissy enough as it is, if you end up with an incomplete
4515580	4519820	podcast, delete the incomplete file, go on to the podcast section of iTunes and click
4519820	4524500	on the Orange Dodge Radio item, the one with the gray iTunes window, click unsubscribe
4524500	4525860	and then click subscribe.
4525860	4530100	After you've recovered from doing all that, iTunes will have refreshed the list of all
4530100	4533500	shows from the feed and immediately start downloading the latest show automatically.
4533500	4535220	You know what's also great about that?
4535220	4539580	The more people that click subscribe, the higher our ranking goes on iTunes.
4539580	4543380	You're also inadvertently helping the station out, so I love this tactic.
4543380	4545700	Kudos to Renee.
4545700	4549540	Regarding your end of the year show, I would like to say that Scott Rubin was quite pissed
4549540	4551220	that he wasn't invited.
4551220	4552220	Rebuttal?
4552220	4556020	He would have been a great guest.
4556020	4563020	You know, Scott, I left the message on Scott's Xbox Live friends list and he befriended me,
4563020	4564020	so his loss.
4564020	4567460	No, I'm just kidding.
4567460	4572340	The reason we picked the people we did is we wanted to get a mix of people that we have
4572340	4578180	on the show a lot like Bobby and people we hadn't had on the show before but respected
4578180	4583860	like VGO and Gamertag Radio and those other things.
4583860	4588360	Scott knows he's welcome on the show any time he wants, so Scott, if you're still feeling
4588360	4591700	butthurt about not being on the show, send us an email, we'd love to have you on any
4591700	4592700	time.
4592700	4597060	Lastly, I don't believe it was reported on OLR, but the classic CD-ROM trivia game You
4597060	4601660	Don't Know Jack semi-returns in web form at YouDon'tKnowJack.com.
4601660	4605380	Currently questions only come in the form of Dis or Dat minigames.
4605380	4610140	The best parts are that a new Dis or Dat is available daily holidays, too, and one of
4610140	4616620	the original hosts, I mean, Cookie, is present.
4616620	4620700	Curiously, the site is also in beta form.
4620700	4623220	Have a happy new year and keep on going, Reenie.
4623220	4627060	Uh, yeah, I looked at the You Don't Know Jack's website and played some of the Dis or Dat.
4627060	4629500	Dude, it's free and it's You Don't Know Jack.
4629500	4630500	Hello?
4630500	4632420	Why aren't you playing?
4632420	4633420	Go take a look.
4633420	4634420	It's awesome.
4634420	4641260	Um, anyway, uh, moving forward, um, we have one from AZHP.
4641260	4646660	Hey, guys, you, um, all were talking about Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, and the possibility
4646660	4649620	of RS2 on 360.
4649620	4653260	Just having gotten Ikaruga, um, as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, I wanted to know
4653260	4657540	what other games has Treasure made, especially games that were on systems in the realm of
4657540	4659060	virtual console games.
4659060	4663980	I have my Wii and I'm an absolute, uh, VC game whore.
4663980	4668660	Not because I played the games in my youth, I'm 18 and in college, but because my paltry
4668660	4673100	$4 a week allowance didn't allow me to buy many $70 games in my youth.
4673100	4678060	That being said, uh, virtual console is a haven for, uh, shrimp fans, as I have Gunstar
4678060	4682940	Heroes, Superstar Soldiers, Soldier Blade, and R-Type and Love Them All, and I'm eagerly,
4682940	4687740	um, anticipating downloading Gradius as soon as I load up more points.
4687740	4691500	So basically, what Treasure games are there that could possibly make their way to virtual
4691500	4692500	console?
4692500	4695740	Eagerly waiting an answer, sincerely AZHP.
4695740	4703540	And I actually emailed back with, um, a list, and, um, give me a second and I will definitely
4703540	4705980	pull up the list that I did.
4705980	4710500	Um, okay, here are the list of games that Treasure has made.
4710500	4716700	Um, for Arcados, Ikaruga, Radiant Silver Gun, Dreamcastles, Bongayo, Ikaruga, Game Boy Advance
4716700	4721580	was Advance Guardian Heroes, Astro Boy Omega Factor, Gunstar Super Heroes, Hajimino Ippo
4721580	4725840	the Fighting, Tiny Toon Adventures, Buster's Bad Dream, I just totally don't see that coming
4725840	4727540	out on virtual console.
4727540	4731820	Game Boy Color was Tiny Toon Adventures, Dizzy's Candy Quest, Game Gear was Dynamite Headdy,
4731820	4737060	Gunstar Heroes, GameCube was Dragon Drive, D Master Shot, Ikaruga, Wario World, Genesis,
4737060	4741340	Alien Soldier, Dynamite Headdy, Gunstar Heroes, Light Crusader, McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure,
4741340	4747580	which I totally don't see coming on virtual console, and Yu Yu Hakusho, Makio, Toitsusen,
4747580	4749500	sorry, um, and then I.Q.
4749500	4754180	Sin and Punishment, Successor to the Earth, Master System had Dynamite Headdy, um, Nintendo
4754180	4758780	64 was Baccarat, this is just a bunch that came out, basically Mission Makers, Bongayo,
4758780	4765120	we had some Bleach games, um, Rakugaki Showtime, Silhouette Mirage, um, basically the games
4765120	4773260	that I see coming out, um, I think that if they start expanding past, um, the 16-bit
4773260	4777240	era, which I kind of hope that they do, we might start seeing some of the Saturn 2D ones
4777240	4780820	out, I would love to see Radiant Silver Gun and Guardian Heroes and Silhouette Mirage
4780820	4781820	coming out.
4781820	4792780	The Saturn games on virtual console, huh, you really think we get Saturn games on virtual
4792780	4795780	console?
4795780	4799260	But I don't see why we wouldn't get some of the, the, the sprite-based ones.
4799260	4803540	Maybe on, I'm gonna say it here and now, I bet you anything in the next three years Nintendo
4803540	4806700	announces a Wii HD, maybe on the Wii HD.
4806700	4810980	But I totally see us getting, um, like, something like Mischief Makers, um.
4810980	4817460	I totally see, um, you know, Dynamite Heady, a bunch of the other ones coming out, I mean,
4817460	4822620	I don't really see why not, if it's not, if it's not just for size, I think that it could
4822620	4824660	definitely, um, handle it.
4824660	4829420	Uh, GS68 makes a good point, soundtracks will raise the file size, because if it uses Red
4829420	4832440	Book Audio, then that's- Why would it use Red Book Audio?
4832440	4833440	Did they?
4833440	4834440	I don't know.
4834440	4835440	Didn't some Saturn games use it?
4835440	4840540	Only some did, and then they started moving in toward, um, the other, eh, I can't remember
4840540	4841540	off the top of my head.
4841540	4842540	Okay.
4842540	4846700	Some games, I mean, some games you can fully put in and just listen to, but they started
4846700	4849860	moving away from that toward- Like, DDR Sekimex, I remember, was just randomly
4849860	4853020	some game I'm thinking of off the top of my head, like, of the PlayStation DDR game?
4853020	4854020	The first DDR, yeah.
4854020	4858140	Yeah, you could, you could put it in a regular CD player and, and hear the songs, the soundtrack.
4858140	4859140	Yeah.
4859140	4863880	Um, a, a lot more games, uh, started moving past that, though, for, for compression.
4863880	4869100	You know, I think that once, if they were able to get some sort of, you know, increased,
4869100	4874220	you know, storage capability for the Wii, I think we could totally start seeing, um,
4874220	4878860	other, uh, you know, later generation system games.
4878860	4879860	I don't see why not.
4879860	4881220	I think they could fully handle it.
4881220	4882860	Well, we'll see.
4882860	4884700	But- Not this year.
4884700	4889100	I'm just glad to see that other people like Treasure, because I love Treasure.
4889100	4896100	Um, also, um, next email, we have one coming from, um, Nike.
4896100	4898780	Hey, OLR, I'm here again.
4898780	4901220	Not quite a lot to say, but I'll try to keep it short.
4901220	4902660	Hey, what's an MMO?
4902660	4904860	Is it like a World of Warcraft style game?
4904860	4908460	MMO is, uh, um, massively multiplayer online.
4908460	4912820	Um, you mean MMORPG, massively multiplayer online roleplay game.
4912820	4916220	MMO is, uh, massively multiplayer online.
4916220	4919220	Which basically means you're playing with hundreds of people or thousands of people
4919220	4921940	at once instead of just two or three, all online.
4921940	4922940	You're all in, like, a world.
4922940	4925020	They're usually world type games.
4925020	4930740	Um, looking on the HMVUK website, they're saying they're selling Excite Truck for pre-order
4930740	4932460	for February for £50.
4932460	4934460	It's nearly $100 a disc.
4934460	4935900	And Case and Some Paper.
4935900	4936900	What a rip-off.
4936900	4937900	Um, actually, no, it's really fun.
4937900	4941140	Um- Yeah, but I- I wouldn't pay $100 for it.
4941140	4942140	Sorry.
4942140	4943820	Uh, see, what kind of music do you lot like?
4943820	4946980	Um, Jamie mentioned ASH, which is number one of my favorites.
4946980	4951700	Rob also mentioned the music from Elite Beat Agents, which has, uh, stuff like, uh, Sum
4951700	4952700	41.
4952700	4955500	Um, me, my favorite bands are Gorillaz and Pain.
4955500	4959700	Oh, it's like actual bands or video game music?
4959700	4960700	I'm just picking music.
4960700	4965200	Because, like, when it comes to video game music, like, I love all the stuff that Mizuguchi
4965200	4966200	is a part of.
4966200	4969780	Like, you know, Space Channel 5 and- and Luminous and all that stuff is awesome.
4969780	4972460	Um, and of course, Nobui Matsu.
4972460	4975580	Uh, when it comes to real music, which I-
4975580	4977580	Rob listens to trancy stuff.
4977580	4978580	Eh, sometimes.
4978580	4980140	It just depends on what I'm in the mood for.
4980140	4981140	Um- And shoes.
4981140	4984260	What if- what if I've been listening to a lot lately?
4984260	4985260	I don't even know.
4985260	4987340	Um- What's that, uh, Icelandic-
4987340	4988340	What, Bjork?
4988340	4989340	No.
4989340	4990340	Uh, Roiksop.
4990340	4991340	I like them.
4991340	4992340	Yeah.
4992340	4993340	They're cool.
4993340	4994340	They're cool.
4994340	4995340	I don't like them.
4995340	4996340	I like Bjork, too, though.
4996340	4997340	And I also like- I also like Death Metal.
4997340	4998340	I do.
4998340	4999340	I know you do.
4999340	5000340	Um- Yeah, I like Guar.
5000340	5003980	Actually, I've been listening to- really weirdly, I've been listening to a lot of Morrissey
5003980	5004980	lately.
5004980	5009020	Mainly, you know, because Morrissey was our emo when we didn't have emo.
5009020	5010020	I love synth pop.
5010020	5011020	That's not my big thing.
5011020	5014820	Ever since DDR Ultramix 2 really got me into synth pop, like Echo Image and all that crap,
5014820	5015820	I love it.
5015820	5016820	Can't get enough of it.
5016820	5020300	Um, Dee, you don't have the Nintendo Point Store in the US, do you?
5020300	5022580	Um, are they still working on that?
5022580	5023580	I haven't looked.
5023580	5024580	A what?
5024580	5026140	Nintendo Point Store.
5026140	5028900	No, we don't have that in the US.
5028900	5030060	The channel is there.
5030060	5034060	No, the Point Store, what they're talking about, it's basically kind of like what they
5034060	5037260	have for the Nintendo Club, I think, in Japan, where you-
5037260	5038260	Oh, yeah.
5038260	5039260	Oh, no.
5039260	5040260	Buy titles and you earn points or stars.
5040260	5041260	No.
5041260	5042260	We're all pissed we don't have it.
5042260	5043260	Yeah.
5043260	5044260	No, we don't have it.
5044260	5049500	Um, also, why, uh, why doesn't Nintendo partner with voice over IP like Skype?
5049500	5052260	The Wiimote has a speaker plus mic, um, actually it just has a speaker.
5052260	5055460	Why doesn't Nintendo actually have some online games for the Wii yet?
5055460	5057540	I mean, it's because they're-
5057540	5061180	For some reason, they feel they need to roll it out slowly, so whatever.
5061180	5062180	It's their strategy.
5062180	5065580	Somehow they feel they're ahead in innovation in some parts and they're really behind in
5065580	5067100	other parts, so whatever.
5067100	5073060	Um, some of these questions I think we've actually already answered, um, and so skipping
5073060	5079180	through I'm gonna, um, say what does OLR team think of renting games, um, good way to test
5079180	5080180	them out?
5080180	5082620	It's something I should be doing that I'm not, honestly.
5082620	5087820	I should be doing, using that Gamefly or comparable type service and I'm not.
5087820	5089380	I really need to look into that.
5089380	5092780	Yeah, maybe I would have avoided buying Red Steel.
5092780	5093780	This is an interesting question.
5093780	5096140	How do you go about getting a job in the game industry?
5096140	5099740	I was wondering as I had many career paths open for me at the moment, including being
5099740	5100740	a doctor.
5100740	5103020	Um, sometimes you just chance into it.
5103020	5107900	I have a friend who is a math major who now is a programmer for a company in the Bay Area.
5107900	5109860	Well, Shane, you kind of work in the game industry.
5109860	5111260	How did you get your job?
5111260	5112260	Accident.
5112260	5113260	Really?
5113260	5116660	I was just, whoops, now I work at a game company.
5116660	5121300	Yeah, it just depends on people you know or if you look at Craigslist.
5121300	5126460	Most of the game companies post entry level positions there all the time.
5126460	5129140	But you really have to be in an area where there's game companies.
5129140	5130140	Yes.
5130140	5131140	I mean if you live...
5131140	5133140	Or your skill needs to be high in demand.
5133140	5138020	I mean if you live in Wichita, Kansas, no offense Shane, that's where you used to live.
5138020	5140340	If you live there, then you're probably not going to find a whole lot of...
5140340	5142180	That's how I got my job, so...
5142180	5146300	Well, but now you're here in California, aren't you?
5146300	5149820	You know, it's best if you live where, Bay Area, LA?
5149820	5154940	Wherever the major game companies are, you've got like Washington, the Redmond area, and
5154940	5157780	then you've got the Bay Area, and then you've got LA.
5157780	5162420	That's where you want to go for the major ones.
5162420	5166740	The reality is though, if you're sitting there thinking, I've got a great idea for a video
5166740	5167740	game...
5167740	5168740	Wisconsin.
5168740	5170460	Oh, they have the one company there.
5170460	5176180	I'm just saying, because I was thinking about Mexico.
5176180	5178940	A lot of major metros have at least one.
5178940	5184400	Keep in mind that the industry, though, is very, very diverse.
5184400	5187100	You can be an artist, get in as a designer.
5187100	5188420	You can be a writer.
5188420	5195040	I was asked if I was interested in writing game manuals, and part of why I was going
5195040	5196980	to school was to actually do manuals.
5196980	5197980	Why'd you turn that down?
5197980	5199180	I didn't turn it down.
5199180	5201660	I called on it and didn't hear anything.
5201660	5205420	And that was actually for a writing strategy guide, so I don't really want to...
5205420	5206900	I'm in school to do what I want to do.
5206900	5208580	I'm going to be a massage therapist.
5208580	5214740	I could freakin' be an independent contractor for a video game company, giving massages
5214740	5216460	during people's lunch.
5216460	5217460	Pac Bell does that.
5217460	5218460	Oh, yeah.
5218460	5219460	A lot of major companies do.
5219460	5220460	Our company does too.
5220460	5224980	So I could work in the video game industry as a massage therapist.
5224980	5226540	It's possible.
5226540	5229140	I would love to have that be your catch on this show.
5229140	5232660	She works in the game therapy, giving massages and happy endings.
5232660	5234140	I don't give happy endings.
5234140	5238700	You know what's funny, though, we learned that in San Francisco, in the county, for
5238700	5240800	you to be a massage therapist there, you have to...
5240800	5244900	It's considered adult entertainment, so you're lumped in the same category as prostitutes.
5244900	5245900	Hot.
5245900	5246900	I know.
5246900	5249300	I hate it.
5249300	5250300	The last question.
5250300	5253420	I doubt that PS3 will sell many due to its high prices in the UK.
5253420	5255100	It's going to be a lot over here.
5255100	5258500	We get bummed at everything in gaming.
5258500	5261040	Most young gamers already have a 360 or at least a Wii.
5261040	5265180	Just thinking about how much market it will really have apart from now.
5265180	5266180	Wow.
5266180	5267180	It's Sony's stupid fanboy impression.
5267180	5272420	I must say the graphics do look good, no better than 360, though, and played one with Ridge
5272420	5273420	Racer.
5273420	5274560	But you played Ridge Racer.
5274560	5275560	That's not going to...
5275560	5276560	Play Resistance, honestly.
5276560	5281580	I think that that one really plays up the system's capabilities well.
5281580	5284700	So apart from that, though, yeah, the rest of it's crap.
5284700	5285700	Okay.
5285700	5287260	I failed to keep it short, but oh well.
5287260	5290180	This week has been busy going to college next week, so hope that goes well.
5290180	5291180	Until next time, necky.
5291180	5292180	Well, thanks for the email.
5292180	5293180	That was a lot of questions.
5293180	5294180	I was like...
5294180	5295180	Yeah, and I actually skipped...
5295180	5296180	20 questions from our UK fan.
5296180	5297180	Sorry.
5297180	5300420	He got to L, but one repeated.
5300420	5301420	It's all good.
5301420	5302420	It's all good.
5302420	5303420	Okay.
5303420	5304420	We have two more emails to go.
5304420	5305420	All right.
5305420	5311100	This one is from one of our listeners in Belgium, Fabrice.
5311100	5314100	You know one good thing I liked that All Games had at their little thing?
5314100	5317180	They had a big map of the world, and every time they got a collar from somewhere, they'd
5317180	5318180	put a pin in the map.
5318180	5319180	We should totally freaking do that.
5319180	5321180	I think we totally need to steal that idea.
5321180	5322180	For our email.
5322180	5323180	I'm thinking about...
5323180	5324180	Well, we could do both.
5324180	5325180	We do emails on collars.
5325180	5326180	We have blue pins for emails, red pins for collars, something.
5326180	5329020	We have blue pins for emails, red pins for call.
5329020	5330020	Exactly.
5330020	5333340	I'm thinking we might steal that idea, because when I hear that we were getting collars from
5333340	5335580	Argentina and mail from Belgium, that's so cool.
5335580	5336580	I did think it was funny.
5336580	5340820	After a while, you just started handing me the pins, because I took my geography class
5340820	5343980	like a year ago, so I still remember this crap.
5343980	5348980	To continue on with the email, hi, O-L-R. First of all, congratulations on your radio
5348980	5349980	show.
5349980	5353500	Sadly, I've only discovered O-L-R since episode 180 or something since then.
5353500	5355140	I've been listening every week.
5355140	5358820	Also, I can't listen to your live show, because I live in Belgium.
5358820	5359820	That's okay.
5359820	5360820	We forgive you.
5360820	5363460	I wonder what you at O-L-R think of the current state of Sega.
5363460	5367140	The last years, they've done nothing but release crappy game after crappy game.
5367140	5372420	As soon as they use the EA technique, release as much games as you can, and you'll earn
5372420	5373420	money easily.
5373420	5376820	Sonic the Hedgehog was somewhat the epitaph for what they are doing.
5376820	5382060	They only had some good titles, but only the short period after the Dreamcast was dead,
5382060	5383620	like Panzer Dragoon, Orta, etc.
5383620	5388260	I'm a Sega fanboy, but it's even hard for me to get excited about a new Sega title.
5388260	5393620	All I'm looking forward to is Sega Rally Revo and Virtua Tennis 3.
5393620	5394620	What is wrong with them?
5394620	5396940	Do they miss their own console?
5396940	5397940	Did they go with the times?
5397940	5399460	Are they lacking the talent?
5399460	5403980	Will the Dreamcast days ever return when they made games like Virtua Tennis, Crazy Taxi,
5403980	5406980	Shenmue, Rez, etc.
5406980	5413180	They're all highly playable, enjoyable, and for everyone, not only the hardcore gamer.
5413180	5416140	Sega wasn't afraid to experiment and come up with some crazy ideas.
5416140	5418740	Anyways, I wonder what your thoughts on Sega are these days.
5418740	5421020	Keep up the good work, and Dark Sakura Disneyland rules.
5421020	5423020	I love you.
5423020	5428620	I don't know, this is a tough question.
5428620	5431660	I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Sega was making systems for so long and
5431660	5432820	now they only make games.
5432820	5436620	So there has to be some downsizing that comes with that and some of your biggest talents
5436620	5437620	jump ship.
5437620	5440720	They were just in a funk.
5440720	5446340	I think that when you are making games for your system, you know how to make it work
5446340	5447340	on your system.
5447340	5454140	I think that is a lot of strength that when it's your product and you have all the in-house
5454140	5457600	stuff available to you, you know how to make the most of it.
5457600	5461480	I really think that that might be hurting them with some of the newer titles, but also
5461480	5469340	I think that honestly, I hate to say it, but Sega is going to need to get back on the track
5469340	5472100	and find out what made them great to begin with.
5472100	5476020	Instead of doing all the flashy, showy stuff, they need to get back to the heart.
5476020	5479180	I think that they need to take a page from Nintendo.
5479180	5482380	The Phantasy Star universe wasn't bad, in my opinion.
5482380	5483620	It wasn't great.
5483620	5485620	Well, not really average games to me.
5485620	5489580	Full auto was awesome, and Chrome House was slow.
5489580	5491620	Most people didn't like full auto or full auto 2.
5491620	5494380	You're kind of in your own little bubble there.
5494380	5495380	I enjoyed it.
5495380	5496380	I enjoyed full auto.
5496380	5497980	I did end up selling it back, but I enjoyed it.
5497980	5504300	Full auto 2 is kind of, eh, but I mean, hell, they've got a ton of cool games coming out
5504300	5505300	pretty soon.
5505300	5509900	Sonic and the Secret Rings, which should be pretty cool, as long as the control is good
5509900	5510900	on it.
5510900	5516080	Virtua Fighter 5, I mean, that's going to be a pretty solid fighting game for the PS3.
5516080	5518700	Sega Rally Revo.
5518700	5523660	Armored Core 4, the game that I've been waiting for for the longest time.
5523660	5528460	I bought Chrome Hounds thinking, hey, maybe it's Armored Core 4, but no, it's Armored
5528460	5533180	Core 4 with mono or something like that.
5533180	5534660	We need Knights on Wii.
5534660	5536860	I want to say some interesting comments from chat.
5536860	5542100	DDRDollarBill says, Sega needs to make more games that are unique.
5542100	5546660	Bandit says, first Sega starts making consoles, then drop that and just got into games.
5546660	5548460	Sony, you're next.
5548460	5550060	The bold statement there.
5550060	5553340	SSJ100Matt has an idea how Sega can get back to their roots.
5553340	5555180	Two words, blast processing.
5555180	5559380	Well, they're remaking some of their classic franchises like Alien and Syndrome.
5559380	5562580	That looks pretty good for the Wii and like PSP and stuff.
5562580	5565780	Crazy Taxi, they have some game coming, you know, called Crush.
5565780	5566780	I know.
5566780	5568780	I know that we'll save Sega.
5568780	5569780	Sega to Sanchiro.
5569780	5574700	Do you know the last Sega game I played that was absolutely badass and underrated in every
5574700	5578900	way and that people should have respected more was F-Zero.
5578900	5582540	Because remember that was the Sega, Nintendo, and Namco in the arcades partnership.
5582540	5583540	That game was badass.
5583540	5585420	That's still one of my favorite racing games ever.
5585420	5586820	I don't know why they don't remake that.
5586820	5587820	They need a new one.
5587820	5590180	Sega needs to start doing games exclusively for Nintendo.
5590180	5594180	Or you know what, I hate to say it, but since Nintendo doesn't have the oomph behind it,
5594180	5596820	you know, with the Wii, the Wii doesn't have that pretty stuff.
5596820	5601040	I'm sure there will be inevitably an F-Zero game on the Wii that will be pretty awesome,
5601040	5606100	but seriously, like if Sega made a racer kind of like that, I'm not talking full auto, on
5606100	5608100	the 360, ooh, that'll be hot.
5608100	5609100	That'll be hot.
5609100	5611980	You know what actually franchise, I wouldn't mind seeing coming out on the next system.
5611980	5612980	Or PS3.
5612980	5617500	There was a, I believe it was a Sega, it was Burning Rangers.
5617500	5624360	In fact, I know it was because the music was on freaking Samba de Amigo, but we need Burning
5624360	5626000	Rangers to come back.
5626000	5629140	To clarify for chat, because they're saying F-Zero was done by Sega, not the original
5629140	5630140	obviously.
5630140	5639700	But the GameCube version and arcade, GX and AX, AX was Namco, Sega, Nintendo, the Triforce,
5639700	5642900	and then GX was just Sega and Nintendo.
5642900	5645500	And I'll tell you what, booting that game for the first time and seeing both those logos
5645500	5649500	on the screen at the same time, that was a weird feeling for me, the 80s gamer.
5649500	5650500	I'm sorry.
5650500	5652300	Did it make you feel happy in the pants?
5652300	5655660	No, it made me feel weird.
5655660	5658940	I'm looking at this going, but Sega does what Nintendo don't.
5658940	5662420	I don't, this is beyond comprehension.
5662420	5663420	Another email?
5663420	5664420	That actually was the last of our emails.
5664420	5665420	Oh, it was nice.
5665420	5666420	Another window opened.
5666420	5667420	Okay.
5667420	5668420	So yeah, send us more.
5668420	5669420	Send us more.
5669420	5670420	We like it.
5670420	5671420	Mailbagorangeloungeradio.com.
5671420	5675420	I'm sure after some of our stories tonight, we'll get plenty of emails.
5675420	5676980	Battletoads versus Double Dragon.
5676980	5677980	Hell yeah.
5677980	5678980	We need a new one of that.
5678980	5680260	Did Sega do that?
5680260	5681260	It was on Genesis.
5681260	5685460	Wasn't Tecmo responsible for both those franchises?
5685460	5686460	I can't remember.
5686460	5690140	Yeah, the Streets of Rage was Burning Knuckle.
5690140	5691140	Acclaim.
5691140	5692140	Battletoads is rare?
5692140	5696220	No, Battletoads was Acclaim, I want to say.
5696220	5697220	I'll remember.
5697220	5700380	Making me go to Wikipedia, god damn it.
5700380	5703580	So anyways, we've got some interesting stuff about Nintendo, actually.
5703580	5709100	Mad Catz is doing a third-party Wii-mote that looks like a penis.
5709100	5711660	So way to go, Mad Catz.
5711660	5716620	You've taken the Wii and made it look like a sex toy.
5716620	5717620	Excellent.
5717620	5721980	Yeah, it's supposed to be more ergonomic looking, but it looks like a penis.
5721980	5725140	I'm sorry.
5725140	5728900	Be sure to pick up your third-party penis by Mad Catz.
5728900	5729900	Coming soon.
5729900	5730900	Joy.
5730900	5731900	Lovely.
5731900	5735940	I remember them saying they were going to have the third-party Wii-motes, but it's kind
5735940	5737780	of interesting to see what some of them look like.
5737780	5738780	That looks like a penis.
5738780	5739780	No, it doesn't.
5739780	5742020	It does so look like a penis.
5742020	5743020	Where are the balls?
5743020	5745980	Okay, well, just a shaft.
5745980	5747980	Let me see.
5747980	5749420	It looks like a vibrator.
5749420	5753420	That doesn't look like any penis I've ever seen.
5753420	5754420	Fine.
5754420	5757820	It looks like a sex toy, though.
5757820	5766140	With those frickin' homemade programs that you can use your Bluetooth devices for, including
5766140	5771220	the Wii vibrator thing, there you go, they've made the complete package for you.
5771220	5772220	All right.
5772220	5777260	By the way, thank you, Wikipedia, Battletoads was a video game franchise by Tradewest.
5777260	5782500	The first game was released by Rare for the NES in 1991.
5782500	5783500	There you go.
5783500	5788180	I remember, I think Tradewest had something to do with Double Dragon, too, if that makes
5788180	5789180	sense.
5789180	5791740	Yeah, they made the original Double Dragon on the NES.
5791740	5792740	There you go.
5792740	5793740	Or published it.
5793740	5794740	Whatever.
5794740	5798580	Anyhow, this is a good time for us to take a break, I think.
5798580	5800540	We've been going for a little while here, so we're going to take ourselves a little
5800540	5804900	break, and we will come back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5804900	5809420	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
5809420	5810420	a week.
