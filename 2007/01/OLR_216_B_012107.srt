Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,500
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, January 21st, 2007

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
for our Part B of our little program we do here.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,000
And, of course, our podcast or audio blog is released on Mondays and Wednesdays

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but we record live on Sunday nights over at orangeloungeradio.com at 6 o'clock.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You can also hear our rebroadcast on allgames.com Monday nights at 5 o'clock pacific

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Mikul Tov was guesting with us during Part A, but he's actually having to take off

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,500
so he won't be around for Part B.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
So, bye-bye Mikul Tov!

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,500
And now we're going to get back into some news.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't wanna. Okay, well...

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You have to.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Do I have to?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You have to.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,500
Okay. Well, there is a game to be coming out called Flow

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
that had a December 6 release date.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,000
And I say had.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,500
It's now been pushed back to January 2007.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
That means, you know, maybe a couple weeks from now, right?

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Right.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
But it just seems like there's, you know, more and more delays.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
The speculation is that they're still fixing little stuff in it.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,500
But when they were pressured for an official statement,

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
SCEA was basically stating,

30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
We'll be posting a trailer at the end of this month, beginning of next.

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
As for the game itself, we will be releasing it near the end of February!

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Wow.

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,500
February.

34
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Yeah.

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
This is a very anticipated online title, though.

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
You know, I played the little online one. It's cute.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
It should be interesting on a PS3.

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
It kind of reminds me of, I don't know, Electroplankton for some weird reason.

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I love Electroplankton.

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
It just does. It kind of reminds me of that for some weird reason.

41
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Right.

42
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Speaking of music games, actually, I want to interject this

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
because I left this out of How Was My Gaming Week?

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
and I don't think it's in our show world tonight.

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
I had a chance, and I can't say how,

46
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,500
but I had a chance to play the dance MMO that's in closed beta right now.

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
And so I want to give you my thoughts on it.

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
It's kind of interesting.

49
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
There's a couple of licensed songs in it,

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
and then the rest of it is all normal stuff.

51
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
And, of course, it's set up very similar to DDR.

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,500
It's like a mix between DDR and one of those online Korean or Japanese games

53
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
that people play like R2 Beat, O2 Jam, those things.

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
The interface really reminds me of that.

55
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
I believe it was developed by one of those companies

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
because it shows the logo there in the beginning.

57
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
I noticed a couple of licensed songs.

58
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
There was a Madonna song in there, but an old one.

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I think it was like Papa Don't Preach was in there.

60
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
And then, of course, I remember

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Jump Around, Jump Around, Jump Up, Jump Up was in there, that song.

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
But some of the steps are pretty atrocious.

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
That's what I noticed.

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,500
It starts getting to be very in the groove level difficulty

65
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
when you get up pretty high, which on your fingers is...

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I'm serious.

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Some of these steps are just too crazy.

68
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
It's like finger-finger mania or something.

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
But otherwise...

70
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Wow, that sounds fascinating to hear finger mania.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Otherwise, the game was...

72
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
It was very comparable to one of those other types of MMOs you would play.

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
And their music, although long, they don't edit the music down.

74
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
It was all like two, three and a half minute songs.

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
It fit pretty good.

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
I had a fairly okay time with it.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
It screams polish to me.

78
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I hope they don't...

79
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
No, I think they're going to add more stuff to it.

80
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,500
And I hear it's changing a lot.

81
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
You'll notice things get added and disappear,

82
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
so I think they're still putting some tweaks on it.

83
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,500
I'm going to try some more songs that have yet to go into it.

84
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
And I imagine...

85
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
They're probably still trying to figure out what the model is going to be.

86
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I'm pretty sure the game is going to be free,

87
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
which I hope it is,

88
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,500
because I couldn't see myself paying much more than ten bucks for it.

89
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
I understand there might be licenses in the game and stuff,

90
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
but the game itself just not...

91
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
How many people play DDR on the PC?

92
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Not enough, in my opinion.

93
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,500
It's really tough when there's a big DDR simulator out there

94
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,500
that's free and has thousands upon thousands of tracks

95
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
freely available out there.

96
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Anyway, I just wanted to say that.

97
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I got a chance to look at the beta,

98
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
and that's what's going on with it.

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Anyway, back to the news.

100
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Dark Soccer had brought up Flow for the PlayStation 3.

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Another game that was being anticipated for the PlayStation 3 was Warhawk.

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
There was a rumor, and I emphasize a rumor going on right now,

103
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,500
that Warhawk could actually turn into a PS3 downloadable title instead,

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
just like a Gran Turismo HD.

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I believe they did confirm saying that it was not cancelled.

106
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
It was not cancelled. That's good.

107
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
It would be interesting if you have all these games

108
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
that are kind of going down that path.

109
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
But apparently the whole rumor started

110
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
because there was a new director who was brought in

111
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
who was thinking about changing the whole direction for Warhawk.

112
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Interesting.

113
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Yes.

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
What's also interesting is that Wii and PlayStation 3 discs

115
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
have been dumped to ISOs,

116
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,500
making way for a whole new brand of piracy for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

117
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
PlayStation 3 I could see because it's Blu-ray,

118
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
and the system has a hard drive built into it,

119
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,500
so I'm seeing something pretty similar to what happened with the PlayStation 2

120
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
happening with the PlayStation 3.

121
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,500
But right now, Cracking Group Paradox has dumped the first ISO,

122
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
not yet playable, but they've still dumped it,

123
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,500
and it's only a matter of time, of Motorstorm, the Japanese ISO for that.

124
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
And right now they're saying that the first few sectors

125
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
of the PlayStation 3 image are special

126
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
and may contain the decryption keys for the executables,

127
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,500
but right now they still haven't figured out exactly how to run stuff yet.

128
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,500
On the other front, though, with the Wii,

129
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,500
there's actually been a program released to be able to dump that,

130
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,500
and I believe it's two freely available programs to be able to dump those.

131
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
One, of course, is called DVD Info Pro.

132
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
That's available out there right now.

133
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,500
And then there's another program that you use once you have that,

134
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,500
the RAW to Dump, and they'll dump an image of the Wii DVD.

135
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
But of course, once again, they haven't figured out how to run those yet either.

136
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
But that's half the battles, dumping the disc,

137
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
and the other half is getting it on there and playing it,

138
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
so it's only a matter of time.

139
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,500
So how long before we see fully pirated Wii and PS3 games available on the Internet?

140
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Probably a few months.

141
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
The Wii's kind of tricky because it's really hard to read those discs.

142
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
A normal computer can't read them,

143
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,500
so I'm not sure about the Blu-Ray ROMs for the PS3,

144
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
but I know that the Wii ones are pretty hard.

145
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
So I don't know. We'll see.

146
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Hopefully, Sony's protection in the past has been pretty crappy,

147
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,500
so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this stuff pretty soon.

148
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
All right.

149
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Well, as far as getting back into what is actually available and legally,

150
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,500
for our listeners in the UK, actually, there's some new games heading to a virtual console.

151
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
We have Street Fighter II going on there

152
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,500
and also a game called Super Probotector, which in the U.S. is Contra III,

153
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
which is so unfair because I want Contra III.

154
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,500
It's an 800 Wii Point game.

155
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Goodwin, if you want to check it out, let me know how good it pulls over.

156
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
I've been pleased with everything that's come up for virtual consoles.

157
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
They still have Flickr. I think it's fantastic.

158
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
But those are new ones coming out.

159
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Lucky.

160
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Yeah, I want to know what we're getting.

161
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
We still don't know what we're getting tomorrow, do we?

162
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
There's rumors, but we don't know for sure, right?

163
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
I want Super Contra III.

164
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
We don't know, but there's other stuff that's in the works, I know that.

165
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
All kind of rumors, though, right?

166
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I'm sure I've seen Kid Icarus, but...

167
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Well, no, this is stuff that's, of course, coming from the ESRB website.

168
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
And I want to say, let me see here.

169
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
There was quite a bit that was coming out.

170
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,500
One of them was Bonk III for a virtual console.

171
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
That's coming out soon, at least.

172
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
And I know they were showing...

173
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Well, Kid Icarus was on there a while ago.

174
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Mighty Bomb Jack.

175
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Xevious.

176
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Let's see here, Jewel Quest 2.

177
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I think that's...

178
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Xevious was in last week's releases.

179
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Yeah, that's probably a full game, the Jewel Quest 2 thing.

180
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Let's see here.

181
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
That's all the ones I see.

182
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
What about the Nintendo originals?

183
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Weren't there supposed to be, like, original virtual console things coming out?

184
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Yeah, wasn't there supposed to be online play as well?

185
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Right, it'll come eventually.

186
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Like, eons away from now.

187
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I guess all in good time.

188
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
We'll see.

189
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Well, now, another very interesting story going around about the Wii is that, you know, of course, there's always these, I don't know what you'd call them, parental groups that want to prevent anybody from having fun.

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Well, apparently, the WFAA has put out this thing going out that says that, hey, look, the Wii and the PlayStation 3 can get on the internet.

191
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Therefore, your kids are accessing pornography through the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

192
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Because, you know, how easy is it that you can go on and you can go click-click on, you know, Pornotube or something and go access some pornography?

193
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,500
I'm actually looking at the website here that says, oh, my gosh, these games are internet access.

194
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
They're gateways to pornography.

195
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,500
They can play WarioWare, Guitar Hero, and PlayStation 3 as well, and pornography.

196
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I love the pornography game.

197
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
There's a quote here in this article, quote, they're innocent and we want to try and keep them that way.

198
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
It's very upsetting something this popular, a kid game, can go that direction so quickly.

199
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Oh, shut up, stupid fucking...

200
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,500
And even in this story, in a blog one child boasted, the first thing I thought of when I downloaded the Wii browser was also porn.

201
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Yeah, I'm sure it was really a child that was blogging about that shit.

202
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Well, if they were under 18, you'd see a 17-year-old would be considered a child.

203
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
But it's the same damn thing as the computer, right?

204
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Yeah.

205
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,500
If you have a PC in your house, that is also a gateway to porn.

206
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,500
So monitor your kids' Wii and PS3 use just like you do their PC use.

207
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Duh.

208
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
How hard is that?

209
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
That kind of pisses me off that people are trying to spin this.

210
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
It's like, oh, my gosh, the Wii has chicks doing it on it.

211
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Well, that's just like saying, you know, eating McDonald's is going to make you fat.

212
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Then the next week later, oh, eating Burger King is going to make you fat.

213
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
And then the next week later, oh, Taco Bell is going to make you fat.

214
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
They're all gateways to fatness.

215
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,500
You know, well, it's just fucking stupid bitches that need the fucking attention.

216
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,500
And every news outlet seems to do this kind of shit too.

217
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Oh, my God, it's because they don't have news and they need something to fill space.

218
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
That's what it fucking is.

219
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,500
And if there's another, you know, device that comes out there that's a gateway, you know,

220
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
that has the Internet on it, oh, my God, it's a gateway to porn.

221
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
You know what?

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
There's fucking goddamn child safety stuff on there.

223
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,500
They even have the update to block the Internet before, you know, the Internet browser was

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,500
even available and the weather too because, my God, there can be some pornography in the

225
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
weather.

226
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Oh, I remember that one time there was the topless weather girl on the weather channel.

227
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
Well, this is something completely different.

228
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I mean, they have the tools are there for the parents to use and it's just the parents

229
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
are being stupid.

230
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
And that's all it is.

231
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,500
And because for one, I mean, pulling up porn on the Wii is fucking slow.

232
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I mean, granted, you can do it, but they have the parental controls on there.

233
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Lots of good comments from chat chat.

234
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Don't orange launch radio dot com live on this Sunday evening on this topic, DDR dollar

235
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Bill says, fuck, the cell phone is a gateway to the Internet.

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Thus, it can get on porno sites.

237
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,780
James Patrick says, well, there's porn sites built for the Wii like people, you know, kind

238
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,140
of catering to that whole thing.

239
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:46,080
And I'm looking at as well, let's see, Black Boy says, there are also programs that restrict

240
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,220
what websites can be accessed on the computer, but we don't really see anything like that

241
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,220
on the Wii yet.

242
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,220
Yeah.

243
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,220
It's called the parental controls.

244
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,020
Does that work on websites too?

245
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,020
It's for the whole Internet, blocks the whole Internet from.

246
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,280
Oh, okay.

247
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Very interesting.

248
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,460
Also, somebody else said here that you could get it on the PSP as well, and they left it

249
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,460
out.

250
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,580
Well, Shadow Charlie says, PSP can give you porn, and they don't say shit about that.

251
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,500
And then Trax leaves us with this thought, if you can't rationally parent your child,

252
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,540
shouldn't have one in the first place.

253
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, and then, of course, S2H makes this groaner.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,900
These parents are probably the same types who would let people drink two gallons of

255
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,300
water in a short time.

256
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,560
Now they win because water is a gateway to porn.

257
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,500
That takes us to our FUs of the Week, because you know what, when we hear about these stupid,

258
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,620
uninformed stories, we get very angry, and we want to rant a little bit, because we can.

259
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,620
It's our show.

260
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,620
We can do what we want.

261
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:49,980
Dark Soccer, are you ready to get angsty?

262
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,440
I've been ready.

263
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:02,700
My FU of the Week goes towards distance, and knowing that two people that I care an awful

264
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,020
lot about are separated by it right now.

265
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,340
I really don't know what else to say, just that I hope they hang in there and can't wait

266
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,020
to see them together again, and I'm talking about Chris and Megzy.

267
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:25,140
The official OLR lesbians will be reunited again soon.

268
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,300
Fucking to your neighbors, because they're dumb little kids that won't fucking get out

269
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
of the way of cars.

270
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,740
I mean, I'm sitting there trying to park my car, and they're playing football in the middle

271
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,340
street in the dark, by the way, and they won't fucking move, so fuck them, and I'm glad I

272
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,900
ran over your fucking toy last week, stupid bitches, and I will run you over if you get

273
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,780
my car away again.

274
00:14:47,780 --> 00:15:02,220
My FU of the Week goes to my office chair, which is now sitting in the corner of the

275
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,700
room, broken, because it snapped in two places when my fat ass plopped in it the other day.

276
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:20,380
It's quite funny, because it is now the hoopy chair, because you can sit in and lean back.

277
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,940
A big thank you to Duck Tape, which I think will fix my chair soon, although Dark Sakura

278
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,820
did say I could probably get a new one pretty cheap at IKEA, and it would look better than

279
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Duck Tape, and I do love me some IKEA, I need an excuse to go there.

280
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,100
I recommend, though, Duck Tape might fix Dark Sakura's chair.

281
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,300
I've tried to fix this chair with Duck Tape.

282
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
We should just cover the whole chair in Duck Tape.

283
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,820
No, because I don't want to be sneaky.

284
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Maybe I'll get another chair soon, but that means money.

285
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,060
I'd adjust and it'd sound like a fart.

286
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,620
Oh, and FU to dental bills.

287
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,140
Oh, God, I hate when I go to the dentist, I feel like I'm going to a used car salesman.

288
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,260
They're trying to talk me into all this crap I don't need, and it's like, you know, if

289
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:06,080
I don't do it, then my teeth are all going to fall out, and I know that's not true.

290
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,140
My dentist is trying to get me to upgrade to a $1,000 crown.

291
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,940
A crown that costs $1,000 because they say my insurance will only cover a tin can.

292
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,140
I have a $1,000 crown.

293
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,940
Did you pay for all of that out of pocket?

294
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
I paid $500 out of it.

295
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
See, my insurance won't pay for any of it.

296
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
It sucks.

297
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,220
The whole reason I have the one I did is because it was absolute necessity because it was my

298
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,100
back molar that broke.

299
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,180
The root broke, and I had to have the whole thing pulled out.

300
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
No, no, no.

301
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
That's not my situation.

302
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:46,140
See, don't feel bad about having, you know, the tin one when it could be a lot worse.

303
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,140
Exactly.

304
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,460
Anyway, moving on.

305
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,860
This is exactly why I don't go to the dentist.

306
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,620
When you go, you're going to be in for a surprise.

307
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,540
They're going to tell you that your teeth are fucked and you need $5,000 to fix them.

308
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,020
I'll tell them to fuck off and I'll leave.

309
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,100
This is why I never came back.

310
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,740
When your teeth hurt, I mean, teeth pain is the worst type of pain you can have anywhere.

311
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,700
I have one tooth that's been hurting, and I went to the dentist and suddenly they told

312
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,220
me $2,000 worth of work I needed, and I'm like, that's different if your teeth are hurting,

313
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
but mine aren't.

314
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,460
I only have one tooth that hurts, and they tell me I need work on all 20.

315
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,620
I have my wisdom teeth in because I'm wise.

316
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
That's why.

317
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
I hate the dentist.

318
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
I hate the dentist.

319
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,620
I wonder why people are afraid of the dentist.

320
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm involved to have extra chewing power because I eat a lot of meat.

321
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:41,020
I need to eat twice the amount of animals to make up for the vegetarians.

322
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:48,300
The porn industry, they seem to be ahead of technology as far as video and stuff goes.

323
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,260
They were the first to have pre-recorded video cassettes, the first to jump on the DVD bandwagon,

324
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,700
and now the first to be using HD DVD.

325
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,500
That's kind of the format they're going with because of a couple reasons.

326
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,140
First off, HD DVD is a lot easier to produce and cheaper, and also there was that whole

327
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,220
fiasco of people saying that they're actually not going to let them duplicate Blu-Ray discs,

328
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,620
although I don't think that's really the case.

329
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,620
It's just more expensive.

330
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:22,460
Of the two formats, it seems to be out of an impartial survey during the adult entertainment

331
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,580
expo that was going on there that HD DVD sounds like the way it's going to go, at least for

332
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
the porn industry.

333
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,260
So, if you have a 360, there you go, some porn.

334
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,620
Although I do recommend, though, if you are going to watch porn on the PS3, just dump

335
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,540
it to your hard drive.

336
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,780
You know what, though?

337
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,620
I got to be honest.

338
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,460
If they do go to HD DVD, which it sounds like they're going to do, this is it.

339
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,620
It's over.

340
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,940
Format wars are over.

341
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,980
That's what ended VHS in beta when porn went to VHS.

342
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:00,700
I think, though, they make a good point that if it's cheaper to produce, then the disc

343
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,300
prices are going to be cheaper, but right now the retail for disc prices isn't any cheaper

344
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,460
than Blu-Ray.

345
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,880
So it comes down to the bottom line of price, what's going to cost these companies and what

346
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,540
kind of a margin they can make on this stuff because it's cheaper to produce for.

347
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,220
If it's going to be the same quality, then yeah, I think HD DVD is going to win out.

348
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,580
This is why I'm simply saying the format wars are over.

349
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,060
I don't mean to keep dogging on Sony, but look in the porn industry, and who doesn't

350
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
love some porn?

351
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,820
When they go for HD DVD, that's it.

352
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,580
Well, Sony is really kind of known for failed formats anyways.

353
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,420
I mean, let's see here, Betamax, UMD.

354
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,980
Kick them while they're down, Loki.

355
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Kick them while they're down.

356
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,540
I mean, hey, you know, I support Sony just as much, but it's there.

357
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:57,060
Moving on, in New York State, Representative Keith Wright proposed legislation to block

358
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,260
the sales of games that depict racist and religious violence to minors.

359
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:11,500
The bill is A00547, and if it passed, it will block the sales of those games that glamorize

360
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,300
violent crime, suicide, sexual violence, violent racism, religious violence, and illegal use

361
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,980
of drugs or alcohol.

362
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:24,420
He's also called for retailers to play such games in an adults-only section.

363
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:33,900
Retailers would be required to check IDs for buyers under 30.

364
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,460
Again the problem I have with this, who checks what games meet this criteria?

365
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,060
What is considered violent?

366
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,060
That's why we have the ESRB.

367
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,100
I understand that, but I don't like it when I see these bills and they're so vague on

368
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,700
we want to put violent games behind a closed curtain.

369
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,660
Well, what's a violent game?

370
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:02,620
This one actually has been going a bit more to define it, to define the violence at any

371
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,620
rate.

372
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:10,700
However, racism is, I mean, basically anybody can get offended over something if it remotely

373
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:19,260
sounds racist to them, so I don't see how it's, and it works both ways too.

374
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:25,700
I think that honestly, again, it's not the place of our government to decide what gets

375
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
sold to who.

376
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,980
I think it's the job of the parents to take a more active role in what their children

377
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,700
are playing.

378
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,800
Talk to them, look in every so often, but in the end, it's not the place of our government

379
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
to decide.

380
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,140
We already have rating systems.

381
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Most retailers already can't sell anything that's rated M to a minor, so why is this

382
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
necessary?

383
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,780
All this is is wasting more taxpayer money.

384
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,500
We hadn't done the FUs previously.

385
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,060
All right, anyway, moving on, I want to talk a little bit about PC gaming.

386
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,660
Remember, one of our New Year's resolutions was we were going to give some more love to

387
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,740
PC gaming, and well, technically this is about Mac gaming, but that's okay.

388
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,740
PC is personal computer.

389
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
It's everything.

390
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,060
So Mac fans are going to be in luck because it sounds like GameTap is planning to port

391
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:23,060
Myst Online over to the Mac, and also Myst Online is going to be getting a whole new

392
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,720
world to explore.

393
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,980
It's kind of weird though because GameTap is actually not available on the Mac, and

394
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,820
a lot of people say that's what's stopping them from getting on GameTap, and if GameTap

395
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,860
could bring their pretty big library over to the Mac, that would be something else.

396
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,460
Well, TransGaming is going to be the company that's actually going to bring the title over

397
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,280
to the Mac, so that's kind of cool.

398
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
No release as of yet.

399
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,940
It's just announced that it's happening, but those folks were looking into getting into

400
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,040
Myst Online.

401
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
There you have it.

402
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,780
You can do that on the Mac if you are so inclined.

403
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,760
There you go.

404
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,480
One cool game that's going to be coming to the PC, Monster Hunter, not a real huge franchise

405
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,140
in the United States, but it is pretty big over in Japan.

406
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,560
I think the last one they had was on the PSP.

407
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Pretty cool series.

408
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:16,340
Kind of a cross between, almost like, Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors and, say, Shadow

409
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,780
of the Colossus.

410
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:24,860
You're basically fighting dragons and stuff with really fantasy weapons and stuff like

411
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,860
that.

412
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
So, pretty cool.

413
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,820
Now, hopefully, they'll bring it to 360 or PlayStation 3 or something like that.

414
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
I'd like to see that.

415
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,100
Or even a PlayStation 2 release of the ones that they have in Japan.

416
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,980
Bandits was on the PS2 a while back, I think.

417
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,620
I'm not sure in the United States, but I know it was in Japan.

418
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,860
They've had a few in Japan.

419
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:52,740
I think there was the one on PS2, because I remember seeing it at Dan's old store.

420
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,740
Hmm.

421
00:23:53,740 --> 00:24:04,460
Well, at any rate, as far as other games, there's the Battlefield 2142 Northern Strike

422
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,220
for the PC being worked on right now.

423
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,620
EA's announced it.

424
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:13,940
It's a booster pack being worked on by EA Digital Illusions Studio in Stockholm.

425
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,940
Wow, that's Swedish.

426
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,380
And it's scheduled for release in March 2007.

427
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:27,420
It's going to be a futuristic conflict that's following a second ice age.

428
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,460
They've released more details on the story, but it's also going to include three new maps,

429
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:43,300
the World War II battle scene at the bridge of Remagen, Alpine Titan, and a liberation

430
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,300
at Leipzig.

431
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,260
So, it seems like it's got some stuff going on.

432
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:55,220
Although, it seems to me most people prefer Battlefield 2 to Battlefield 2142.

433
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,980
I played like yay much of Battlefield 2 and decided it wasn't my kind of game, but have

434
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,900
you played a little more of this, Logie?

435
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Nope.

436
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,900
Oh, I thought you had for some reason.

437
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,500
Oh, I had it for free, and I don't try to play too much PC.

438
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,380
In fact, the last PC game I played was Oblivion.

439
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,740
I loaded it on there, and my laptop barely runs it.

440
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,700
But, I played with a lot of cheat devices running at the same time, so I have my super

441
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
powered character.

442
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,060
So, it was fun going around and killing people from long distances away, unlocking spells

443
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:35,060
that were in there for test purposes, and just plainly exerting my force over the citizens

444
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
of a town.

445
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,060
That's what I like.

446
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,380
Why aren't you playing more PC games, man?

447
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,260
I need to play more Fable.

448
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,700
That's not really a PC game, though.

449
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,580
Why aren't you playing more PC games?

450
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,260
Because my PC's old, and because also I just don't have the time for it.

451
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,540
I mean, I just don't have the time for it.

452
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,260
You know, wife doesn't like playing games.

453
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
I see.

454
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,660
Well, maybe there'd be a PC game she likes.

455
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,180
Desperate Housewives of the Game came out, didn't it?

456
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
Should buy that for her.

457
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,820
See if the wife likes that.

458
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
No.

459
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,860
But, that reminds me, though, I should probably load up The Sims 2 again so I can kill more

460
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Sims.

461
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,380
Oh, and maybe get Sims 2 Pets so I can kill animals, too.

462
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,820
All right, well, um, I wonder what you should, too bad you can't make them drink lots of

463
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
water.

464
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
Stop it.

465
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,580
Moving back to the console world, you know, folks that have 360s that are, you know, on

466
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,820
their last legs don't really want to have to send that back if they can help it.

467
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,100
Kotaku ran an interesting story earlier this week about an old urban legend about how you

468
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,500
can save a dying 360.

469
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,360
They're saying that you can wrap your busted 360 in a towel, turn it on, leave it on for

470
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,940
ten to fifteen minutes, turn it off, remove the towel, and turn it back on and it works.

471
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,060
And apparently this will cure the three red rings of death.

472
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,940
So this is just a rumor that they're running and apparently, you know, some commenters

473
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,540
on the site say, you know, it does kind of make sense.

474
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,740
One commenter on the site said it's kind of like a heat gun trick.

475
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,180
Instead of using a heat gun, you're using the heat coming off the CPU because you're

476
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,460
wrapping it up in the towels.

477
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
It's not a good idea.

478
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
Why?

479
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Just put it that way.

480
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
It's not a good idea to do it.

481
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
Why?

482
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,220
Because before the thought was that they were overheating because the contact between the

483
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,060
heat sink and the actual processor, whatever they would, you know, put in there, wasn't

484
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,780
fully melted all the way.

485
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,220
And so using the heat gun, you would melt that so it didn't have a better contact with

486
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,980
the heat sink and it would cause it to not overheat.

487
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,620
Well, by wrapping this whole thing in a towel, you may be, you know, duplicating that, but

488
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,180
at the same time, you're overheating everything else and causing stuff to break.

489
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,220
So in a sense, I guess if you have the three rings of death already, you might as well

490
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,540
give it a shot because it's not going to hurt nothing.

491
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,540
But I mean...

492
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
Not going to help it either.

493
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
It's not going to probably help it either.

494
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,000
Well, JeremyTau1 says on the IGM message board, someone tried the towel trick and they said

495
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,540
it actually worked.

496
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,820
ActDeaf says, hey, I got the three rings of death.

497
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
Just hit your 360.

498
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,940
It really works.

499
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,900
And then, of course, we have a comment from Drunami.

500
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,740
Just give your 360 a lot of water.

501
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,740
Submerge it.

502
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,460
Topic change, please.

503
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,100
Submerge it into the ocean.

504
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Topic change, please.

505
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,900
Anyway, speaking of funny, crazy stuff, let's talk about our friend, Ken Kutaragi.

506
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Crayon Man!

507
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,540
In 2006, he had a lot of crazy things to say.

508
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,020
All the more reason I think that, you know, we should really get him to stop talking.

509
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,260
But there is actually a website, though, that compiled a pretty interesting list of his

510
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,040
quotes on PS3 today.

511
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,720
And so we thought we would share some of them with you and maybe have some discussion about

512
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,620
how crazy he is.

513
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,780
First off, the PlayStation 3 is not a game machine.

514
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,180
That was a quote from him.

515
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,860
So not a game machine.

516
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,060
I guess it's a computer.

517
00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:01,140
Anyways, being us for a short moment is like accidentally winning a point from a Sheerhan,

518
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,240
a karate master, and Microsoft is still not a black belt.

519
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,420
Just like with their operating systems, they might come out with something good around

520
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,180
the third generation of their release.

521
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,340
So I don't get that.

522
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,340
That doesn't make any sense.

523
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Let's see here.

524
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Oh, this one's kind of funny.

525
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,980
Microsoft shoots for the moon.

526
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
So do you.

527
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Did you just say Microsoft?

528
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,980
No, I think.

529
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,060
We're all having topic problems or talking problems.

530
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,060
See, I can't even talk.

531
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,060
We're all having talking problems.

532
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,060
I don't think that I've said anything.

533
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,900
It's in the water in this town.

534
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,980
The water not only is killing people, but it's making people stupid.

535
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,140
Anyways, Microsoft shoots for the moon.

536
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,980
Sony shoots for the sun.

537
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:48,860
This time Microsoft has stated clearly that it's going after the PlayStation.

538
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:55,360
However, not after the PlayStation 3, but the PlayStation 2, they were looking at 2

539
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,960
and that's why Xbox 360 became like that.

540
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,340
Because it's the second console from them, they're going after the second console from

541
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Sony.

542
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,140
Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense either.

543
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,440
With PlayStation or the PlayStation 3, our intentions have been to create a machine with

544
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,820
super computer calculation capabilities for home entertainment.

545
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Okay.

546
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,520
All right.

547
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,860
And then I'm trying to find the funniest one here.

548
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,300
We're not going to equip the PlayStation 3 or the hard drive by default because no matter

549
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,700
how much capacity we put in it, it won't be enough.

550
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,900
Yeah, to load all those games that you're going to need to stream off your hard drive

551
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,140
because the Blu-ray drive is too slow.

552
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,700
Oh, this one's funny.

553
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,180
All right, last one.

554
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,580
The PlayStation 3 will instill discipline in our children and adults alike.

555
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,500
Everyone will know discipline.

556
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,420
Will the PS3 spank you when you're naughty?

557
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,100
Is that the kind of discipline it's going to be?

558
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,700
Because maybe I'd buy one if that's what it'll do.

559
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,460
Because I need some discipline.

560
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,900
The spank ray returns.

561
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Hooray.

562
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,340
Old gaming reference there.

563
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,820
What also returns this week as it shows up every week except the week we were off last

564
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,160
week is DarkSakura's website of the week.

565
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,440
She serves the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and all over

566
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
the place.

567
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,760
In fact, I hear there's 13 different ways she can hold her internet including the mortar

568
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,540
and pestle and she finds a website that she likes and shares it all with you here on our

569
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
program.

570
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
It's called DarkSakura's website of the week.

571
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,540
See?

572
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,540
It's something in the water.

573
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,540
I don't drink the water, though.

574
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,540
I had coffee.

575
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
Coffee is made of water, stupid.

576
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
I didn't use tap water, though.

577
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
I used filtered water.

578
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,540
I filter all the stupid out of it.

579
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
Whatever.

580
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:50,540
Anyway, the website of the week is YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com, best site ever.

581
00:31:50,540 --> 00:32:01,340
This site actually has downloadable notices that you can leave on people's cars like in

582
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,940
fraction number one and fraction number two.

583
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,020
They're available in PDF format and you can leave them on cars that you see parked badly

584
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:14,020
as in double parking, being too close to the line where no one can get out of the car next

585
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,860
to them.

586
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:22,820
The best thing about it is that it has check marks that you can put on there to say, like,

587
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,460
listed two spots, one car, a little too close, too far away from the driveway, too close

588
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,420
to my driveway, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so

589
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:38,100
cool car, move up, that's compact, and others so that you can walk it in.

590
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,780
And there's a disclaimer that says, Parking is far too limited in our overcrowded streets

591
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,780
and parking lots and you happen to park like an asshole.

592
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,300
Go to the above website to see why someone else thought you parked like an asshole.

593
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,620
Don't be too offended, we all do it one time or another, it just so happens that you got

594
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,620
caught.

595
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,460
Dude, Jamie, I'll give you a quarter to leave one on next to first car.

596
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,700
Dude, I'd do it for free.

597
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,140
Well, what was I going to say?

598
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
And you can also send pictures to the site, too.

599
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,700
They need the one that's like four corners, it's where you park in four spaces at once,

600
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,620
you know, like just down the center of the crossing.

601
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,180
I'm going to go to the site, look, I have a little printer right here, a little cheap

602
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,860
ass $30 printer, I'm going to go to the site, first thing when I can, when the show is done,

603
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,700
I'm going to print some out and carry them around in my car and I'll let you know how

604
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
many I use.

605
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,300
Actually, yesterday, when I was getting sushi, there were these people who were just parked,

606
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,820
I mean, really freaking parked badly, like the line was in the middle of both of their

607
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
cars.

608
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,740
Well, how about they need the one on there that says this is not a parking spot, you

609
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,380
know, it's like in the middle of the road or like double parked or just wherever.

610
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,140
Well, also, you can, well, this is what I did, I actually just hand wrote notes and

611
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,700
left diagrams pointing the proper way to park and the first one says, you park like an idiot,

612
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,100
you learn how to do this when you're a teenager, don't do it again, and the other one was,

613
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,620
you park like you're retarded, get back on the short bus.

614
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,740
Wow, that's, what if the person, what if the person really was mentally challenged, that

615
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,740
would have been, that would have been.

616
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,740
Then they don't need to be driving.

617
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,380
But this person was triple parked, I kid you not, not even for legitimate reasons, it was

618
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
at a restaurant.

619
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,540
Alright, real quick here, I got one more Ken Kutaragi quote, I missed this one, it says,

620
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,620
if processors of high performance and wide bandwidth like the cell were linked together

621
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:22,220
without sufficient security, a worldwide system crash could occur with one attack.

622
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,020
Is there a site called YouTalkLikeAnAsshole.com?

623
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,220
I don't know.

624
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:34,820
Speaking of assholes, here's one in training, apparently a nine-year-old child stole their

625
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:41,780
neighbor's car, got spotted by police on the interstate, guns it to a 90 mile an hour chase,

626
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,520
the kid tried to take an exit ramp but the engine blew and the car hit a curb, went into

627
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,820
a tree and the kid gets captured.

628
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,220
How the hell did a nine-year-old learn to drive a car?

629
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:56,500
I had to do so many loops in the parking lot at my high school with a driver's ed instructor

630
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,840
before I was ever able to figure out how to drive.

631
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,220
Same way I did, Ridge Racer.

632
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:08,820
Well, yeah, you're not helping much because apparently according to what was going on

633
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:14,420
is that the mom believed that PlayStation taught him how to do all this, so apparently

634
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,220
either Grand Theft Auto or Ridge Racer, this is where he learned to drive and do all this

635
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,980
and hightail it to get away from the cops.

636
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,980
You're not helping Dark Soccer.

637
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,540
Well, did you see the other part of this?

638
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,340
They don't have accurate driving simulators.

639
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,060
I think it was arcade games that did it.

640
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,340
It's all Gran Turismo's fault.

641
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,700
Did you see the real driving simulator?

642
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,620
Anyways, did you see the rest of the story where they were talking about how he, before

643
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,580
that, also recently evaded airport security, managing the Hoppa flight?

644
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,260
No, they're trying to turn it into Chuck Norris.

645
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Come on.

646
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Oh, that'd be funny.

647
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,380
See, that'd be cool if he actually did that because I'd give props to the kid, but yeah,

648
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,300
I think, though, seriously...

649
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,420
Props to the kid?

650
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,380
That's my tax dollars paying to bust his ass.

651
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
Fuck that.

652
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Put him in juvie.

653
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,300
No, props to the kid because the parents should get, you know, fucking billed for something

654
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
for this shit.

655
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,920
I absolutely agree the parents should be billed for it all.

656
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,740
My tax dollars should not go to pay for this stupid kid.

657
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,700
Don't let little Billy in the goddamn car.

658
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
It's a gateway to porn.

659
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Well, he stole the neighbor's car.

660
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,700
He could drive to a porno shop.

661
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,540
Where did he learn to steal a car?

662
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
You can't...

663
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,420
In a video game, you press X to steal the car.

664
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,340
You did not go through the whole process.

665
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,620
He didn't steal a car.

666
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,620
Here's what happened.

667
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,260
Little fucking, you know, mommy went into the store, Billy, stay in the car, I'm going

668
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,380
to leave it running, got in the driver's seat and drove off.

669
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
That's what happened.

670
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
It said it was the neighbor's car.

671
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
Well, fine.

672
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,860
The neighbor let him into the car.

673
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,880
What are they doing leaving their car unlocked?

674
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,460
With the keys in the ignition.

675
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,060
With a crazy nine-year-old in the neighborhood.

676
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,620
Dennis the Menace, we're on to you.

677
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:55,260
Anyways, so speaking of crazy driving and stuff, Burnout 5 is coming out and I cannot

678
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,260
wait for that.

679
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,100
And I know that, you know, apparently there's been some screenshots where pedestrians have

680
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
been spotted.

681
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,160
I can only hope that that were the case, but unfortunately I'm thinking this is from some

682
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,460
sort of cut scene in the game.

683
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,500
But if there's pedestrians and I can hit them going 200 miles an hour, that sold the game

684
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,740
twice to me right there.

685
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Seriously, me too.

686
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,020
I'm like, seriously, if there's actually pedestrians on the road that like run away from your car

687
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,940
and stuff, oh my God, did I just buy this game like three times.

688
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,540
Burnout is so hot to begin with, like it's one of my favorite racers.

689
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
It really is awesome.

690
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
Except for the soundtracks.

691
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
I always change.

692
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
That's why I love 360.

693
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,940
You can just change out the soundtrack.

694
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,260
But oh man, oh man.

695
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,660
I want an M-rated game, oh fuck that, you know, an adult-only game where I can blow

696
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,660
these people.

697
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,180
I want to see blood splatters and skull fragments shattering into my window.

698
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,180
That'd be awesome.

699
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:53,020
Seriously, I think if, you know, especially with Rockstar and the next Grand Theft Auto

700
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,580
game, hell, just to go adult-only and just fucking go crazy.

701
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,060
Go fucking nuts.

702
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,740
Just have a normal, like, do like movies, you know, have a rated version of the game

703
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,740
and have the underrated, you know.

704
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,540
That way you can still sell as many copies and, you know, some people will buy the underrated

705
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:15,300
where you can fucking blow people up and have skull fragments, you know, slam into your

706
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
car.

707
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,380
It'd be cool, though, if like the skull fragments could impale other people and embed in their

708
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,860
skulls and kill them.

709
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,860
Yeah.

710
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,260
That'd be fantastic.

711
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
Anyway.

712
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,060
You guys are morbid.

713
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
I am not.

714
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,980
I would love to read some chat comments right now, but I just totally got booted from chat.

715
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
I pinged out, so I'm trying to get back to you.

716
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
I'll read chat comments.

717
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Thank you.

718
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
Is there anything interesting?

719
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,980
Dark Sakura is awesome.

720
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,980
Real ones, please.

721
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:48,540
They're just like saying a yay burnout and red asphalt, someone said.

722
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,540
Ouch.

723
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:59,660
But moving on to the next story, speaking of fun violence, we have Calling All Cars,

724
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,420
formerly known as Criminal Crackdown, which is supposed to be a mix of stuff like Bomberman

725
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,740
and Twisted Metal and Demolition Derby with explosions and crashes and criminals and crashes

726
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,460
and more crashes and more crashes.

727
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,500
It kind of looks like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.

728
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
I know.

729
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,100
It has that same sort of, well, it's more of a diagonally overhead view, I think.

730
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:27,300
But Sony Computer Entertainment is saying that it would be out by March.

731
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,980
So let's hope so.

732
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
That looks kind of fun to me.

733
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,220
I love exploding stuff.

734
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,540
I love the description here.

735
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:45,060
It says Tom and Jerry type violence with mass destruction.

736
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Sounds interesting.

737
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
All right.

738
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:52,820
Well, we're going to take your calls pretty soon on our Skype line, which is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

739
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,120
The username is Skype.

740
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,780
But one other thing that that phone line can be used for is to leave voicemails when we're

741
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,900
not here.

742
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:13,780
We like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when we're not able to take your

743
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,780
calls live.

744
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,380
And we're going to play some of those voicemails right now.

745
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,020
We got some really good ones from the last couple shows.

746
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,580
So here's our first voicemail.

747
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,580
This one's about two minutes.

748
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,580
Hi.

749
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,340
This is Razorburn 2021.

750
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,820
I wanted to make some comments on last week's show.

751
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,340
I just got done with my weekly listen, and ParadoxVincent's call about Wii Sports kind

752
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:37,420
of got me thinking about a problem I've been having for the last couple of gens with Nintendo

753
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,420
product.

754
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:42,580
It's one of the things that kind of held me back from really getting into it, and it's

755
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,260
kind of a Nintendo fanaticism.

756
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:55,540
Guys like ParadoxVincent, if you can't look at a game like Wii Sports, I mean, I'm huge.

757
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,740
I really, really enjoy Gears of War, but I can look at it and see why there are people

758
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,020
that won't like it.

759
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,860
I can see why people would see it as boring or that it just doesn't have the flair they're

760
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,860
looking for.

761
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,460
If you can't look at Wii Sports and see why a critic would bash it, I think you've really

762
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,980
kind of let yourself get a little too into Nintendo.

763
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,260
There's this feeling out there that Nintendo can do no wrong, and I think Graybush, when

764
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,780
you had your interview, touched on a little bit that most systems have fans that are way,

765
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,860
way harder on their games than Nintendo, because I think right now Wii fanatics are kind of

766
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,900
really thirsty for every game to be this, specifically the Nintendo titles, to be a

767
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,900
huge success.

768
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,020
I've heard stories from most podcasts I listen to about, well, over the holidays I took it

769
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,460
and my grandma wanted to play Wii Sports, but yeah, I mean, I've heard that a lot that

770
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,420
how many of your grandmas really are going out and buying a Wii.

771
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,220
You say, well, Grandma came over and she wanted to talk to me about Wii, but I mean, how many

772
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,140
of the grandmas are sitting around the hair parlor and saying, well, where's Edith?

773
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,380
Last week I played Wii Bowling!

774
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,940
Gaming has come a long way, but I think it's come a long way.

775
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,140
I'm sure your grandpa will play Wii Sports with you, but I don't think, you know, he

776
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,140
was a nom.

777
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,700
He's not going to sit down and play elephants.

778
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:14,540
I think that you need to be able to see both sides of an argument to really be a gamer,

779
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,140
and I think if you're really looking at the Wii from this perspective of there's going

780
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,660
to be this rude awakening because everybody can get into it, I think that's looking at

781
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,660
it wrong.

782
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,260
I think that if you're someone who's a true gamer, you know, maybe it should bother you

783
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,940
a little bit that everything's being simplified so that everyone can be into it.

784
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,980
I'm being kind of rambly now and now my call's gone too long, so I'm just going to let you

785
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
go.

786
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,980
Love you.

787
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,960
Well, thank you very much for the voicemail.

788
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,420
We appreciate it.

789
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,420
You know, it's kind of interesting.

790
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,380
I'm kind of trying to think back to the show when that was taped and kind of everything

791
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,900
that we said that was going on there.

792
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,780
I don't think it's necessarily that Nintendo can do no wrong, because certainly at least

793
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,100
us here in the studio pointed out many faults that Nintendo's done.

794
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,620
We were just making fun of Red Steel earlier, although granted that's a third-party title,

795
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,780
but most people would say, hey, it's a mistake.

796
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,020
Nintendo's not online right now.

797
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:12,460
They should have made some different decisions maybe with the Wii, and they're certainly

798
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,100
capable of doing things that are wrong.

799
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,740
I just think maybe folks thought that that particular review on Wii Sports was really

800
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:22,220
harsh because of the fact that so many people can pick up and go with Wii Sports.

801
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,940
I suppose you're right that grandmas and grandpas aren't exactly buying Wiis, and that's what

802
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,100
it's all about.

803
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,980
But I think not so much grandmas and grandpas, but parents.

804
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,420
I think if parents feel like they could get into a video game system with their children,

805
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,860
I think that's what could really sell the Wii systems right there.

806
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:42,460
I think that's kind of the thing that maybe that particular caller was going for in that

807
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
call.

808
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,780
But certainly Nintendo is not without their own faults.

809
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,580
Wii Sports may not have been on my top ten of the year necessarily, but I thought it

810
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,300
was a good game and better than average.

811
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,700
I don't think it was deserving of a negative review, but I suppose everybody has their

812
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,700
opinions.

813
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Thanks for the voicemail, though.

814
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,700
That was kind of funny.

815
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,700
I like that.

816
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,700
You're a funny guy.

817
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,700
All right.

818
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,980
Let's go to our next voicemail and our last voicemail of the week.

819
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,980
Hey, guys.

820
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,540
This is Mr. Wonderful from the forum.

821
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,540
I just wanted to chime in with what Sky was saying on the most recent show about gaming

822
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,740
journalism being in for a rude awakening.

823
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,740
I couldn't agree more.

824
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:22,260
I'm a gaming journalist myself, and for too long the gaming journalism community has really

825
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,460
just been focusing on what they perceive to be hardcore and trying to tell the community

826
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,960
about what's new and hardcore and underground, but they're a mainstream publication.

827
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,060
They need to appeal to all walks of life.

828
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,660
They need to appeal to the gaming public as a whole, not just niches.

829
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,740
So I think that the Wii is going to provide a huge awakening, it's going to provide a

830
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,900
revolution, if you will, of this community, because journalists can't just say, you know,

831
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,020
Gears of War is the greatest game ever because, you know, Cliffy B made it and all this.

832
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,900
There's a lot of new gamers out there who don't know who Cliffy B is and probably don't

833
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,900
care.

834
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,060
They're going to have to start covering more, a wider range of topics, and they're going

835
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,140
to have to start backing up claims, going to start.

836
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,620
I think we're going to see a new age of gaming magazines.

837
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,180
They can't just keep continuing on the path they're on or this huge audience that Nintendo

838
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:15,140
has got is not going to be buying their magazines if they don't understand a damn word of them.

839
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:19,100
So yeah, I agree pretty much wholeheartedly with what you're saying.

840
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:23,380
It's going to be an interesting time for journalism as well as gaming, and I can't wait to see

841
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:27,460
where it goes, but if somebody doesn't pick up on this trend that there's non-gamers that

842
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:31,820
are gaming now, then I don't think they're going to get into it, whereas if there is

843
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,820
a magazine out there that caters to this idea that people who haven't played games and don't

844
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:42,420
know as much about the history or the culture of gaming, and kind of a my first gaming magazine,

845
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,180
if you will, I think something like that could have huge success.

846
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,140
So I'd really like to see something like that happen.

847
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,020
Great show and keep up the great work.

848
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,020
Looking forward to the next one.

849
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,020
Take it easy, guys.

850
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,020
Thank you very much for the voicemail.

851
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
We appreciate it.

852
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,020
I don't know.

853
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
What do you guys think?

854
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,740
Again, this goes back to the whole casual gaming magazine.

855
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,660
Although I agree with what the guy is saying, because he was agreeing with me, I don't know

856
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,860
if I necessarily think, and kind of reflecting and thinking about that, I don't know if a

857
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,580
casual gaming magazine would really sell, because people usually buy magazines for their

858
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,100
hobbies and the things they're really into, so I don't know if necessarily a casual gaming

859
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,620
magazine would sell, but I kind of go back to something I had referenced on that particular

860
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,080
show where I said magazines like Entertainment Weekly and so on need to expand on their gaming

861
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:30,660
sections and magazines that are dedicated to entertainment and those types of things

862
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,340
in general should look at these things from a casual game perspective.

863
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,340
That was my thought.

864
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,260
Anything else you guys want to add?

865
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,980
I don't know.

866
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:49,100
I'm just glad that they have the perspectives out there for casual gamers as well as a hardcore

867
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:53,980
gamer because a lot of people just don't really get the perspectives of the other person.

868
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,380
So it's kind of good that they have that kind of stuff out there.

869
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,740
DJ Morpheus in chat says, why doesn't OLR play hate voicemails?

870
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,740
Because everyone loves us.

871
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,740
We don't get hate voicemails.

872
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,740
Start sending them in.

873
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,140
Yeah, call and leave us some, I don't know.

874
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,820
We listen to them and get a chuckle out of it and then we delete it.

875
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:18,060
Let's see, James Patrick has a good comment, saying Nintendo fans are crazy is stupid.

876
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,220
Madden fans, GTA fans, a lot of fans are just as bad.

877
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:29,540
SSJ 100 Matt has an interesting comment.

878
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,300
Some Nintendo fanboys are getting as bad as Scientologists.

879
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,500
When someone says something bad about it, they go on the offensive, like the Zelda 8.8

880
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
rating.

881
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,900
I agree people got their panties way too ruffled over that one.

882
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,660
People in general should just realize it's just some dude's opinion who happens to work

883
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,980
for a big website that all you people visit.

884
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,920
I don't know why, but you do and you apparently listen to what they have to say, but in the

885
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,220
end it's just one dude's opinion.

886
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,500
What makes these people any more qualified than you, you or me?

887
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,700
I mean, I realize they went to journalism school, they know how to write and they have

888
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,860
a love of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff.

889
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,060
But I have a love of games.

890
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:18,980
You that listened and downloaded this video game podcast has a love of games.

891
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:23,420
So these guys know their spelling and their grammar and how to write a good review.

892
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,660
That's about it.

893
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:29,340
It doesn't always mean, I mean, I don't think, to be honest, that a lot of these people have

894
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,620
gone to journalism school.

895
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,900
I think they're just being hired, so.

896
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:38,180
I could almost, in fact, I know for a fact not all of them have.

897
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,180
I know that for a fact.

898
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,060
Oh well, that's what we got.

899
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,060
Any more news?

900
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,340
Yes, we definitely have some new stuff.

901
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:51,740
So this was pretty exciting.

902
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,780
All week long they've been kind of teasing stuff, starting off with a YouTube video of

903
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,580
some prototype footage of it.

904
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:04,620
Brand new Ghostbusters game and it's being produced by a company called ZootFly and right

905
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,780
now it's something that they're developing right now, they're working on it.

906
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,220
Problem is, of course, they're being held up by a lot of the licensing issues, you know,

907
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,580
with the movie, etc.

908
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,460
So it's something that's being currently worked on, but it looks pretty cool so far.

909
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,580
And right now, on top of the Ghostbusters game, ZootFly is also working on another game

910
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:31,100
called Time Zero and it's basically, it's kind of related to Ghostbusters a little bit,

911
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:39,500
talks about two adventurers who are die-hard New Yorkers and they get trapped in a deep,

912
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,940
like the shadow world of a parallel New York and the city itself is actually a war machine

913
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,180
threatening to wipe out the world and they have three days to stop it.

914
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,140
So that's kind of neat, they're working on that and I know they're also working on another

915
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:56,700
game called Toy Wars, which is coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, which looks pretty cool

916
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,700
too.

917
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:04,500
So hopefully people, you know, so far the response has been pretty good on it and a

918
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,060
lot of fans want to see this thing made, so hopefully a publisher jumps on this and gets

919
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:14,820
the licensing rights paid for and hopefully we see this game, you know, come to fruition.

920
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,820
Alright.

921
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:21,180
Well, that sounds pretty cool and I like that screenshot of the toy game that you showed

922
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,580
me and that's kind of cool.

923
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,580
Yeah.

924
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,820
Is this something you'll probably buy?

925
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,060
It would be.

926
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,580
I like Ghostbusters, I think it'd be fun.

927
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,680
Will it have the song in it?

928
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,680
That's all I want to know.

929
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,580
Um, actually the song is different, they have a rock version of it in the video that they

930
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,300
were showing, so I liked it.

931
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,300
I thought it was pretty cool.

932
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,300
Alright.

933
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,300
Very cool.

934
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,300
Alright.

935
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,940
Well, this is the point of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line.

936
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,860
If you want to give us a call, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can give

937
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:53,580
us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the US and Canada.

938
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:59,820
Sorry, UK folks and those in other countries, whether it be Australia, wherever you're at,

939
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,740
you'll have to use the old fashioned method of calling us on Skype, which I guess isn't

940
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,060
really old fashioned, but for us it is.

941
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,060
Let's go to the phones.

942
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,140
I'm getting a lot of calls tonight already.

943
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,020
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

944
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,020
Who's this?

945
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,020
Hey, what's up?

946
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,020
It's the Rob D in chat.

947
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,020
Hey, the Rob D in chat.

948
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,020
I like your name.

949
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,020
Thank you.

950
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,020
What's on your mind, buddy?

951
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,020
Not too much.

952
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,220
I was just going to talk about that one article you read about how the Wii is a gateway to

953
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,220
porn.

954
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,260
By the way, I just want to say before we start getting into this, I want to say Rob D's quality

955
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,020
is like perfect right now.

956
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,980
I'm loving this call because I don't hear myself echoing in the background.

957
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
No static.

958
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:34,980
No static.

959
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,700
I can hear his volume is perfect.

960
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,700
This is a model phone call, boys and girls.

961
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,700
I applaud you.

962
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,220
You have a good enunciation.

963
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,220
I do.

964
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,140
I applaud you, Rob D. Not to knock on the other callers because I realize it's internet

965
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:50,020
radio and what have you, but Rob D, whatever you've done to set yourself up, you need to

966
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,780
share that with everybody.

967
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
It's great.

968
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,780
Sounds great.

969
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,780
All right.

970
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,780
So the Wii porn story.

971
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,780
What do you want to say?

972
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,780
All right.

973
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,300
So basically, I don't know if you actually covered this.

974
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,700
I unfortunately was watching part of the Colts game, so I was kind of halfway listening to

975
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,180
OLR.

976
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,180
We forgive you.

977
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,180
Yeah.

978
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,180
I'm sorry.

979
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,180
Okay.

980
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,220
So I don't know if you covered this, but did you read the quote from a supposed child where

981
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:18,080
he said, the first thing I did when I got the Wii was think about porn or something

982
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,080
like that?

983
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,080
Yeah.

984
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,640
Something that the website had got from their blog.

985
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,780
They went and looked at a blog and say, hey, one child said on their blog that the first

986
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,220
thing I thought about when I got the Wii was porn or it was the Wii browser.

987
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,140
First thing I thought about when the Wii browser was porn.

988
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,900
So I was curious about that since it mentioned that it was a blog.

989
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,540
I plugged the quote into Google just to see where it was from.

990
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,140
Ah, good thinking, my friend.

991
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,860
Where did it come from?

992
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,740
It's from a post on Kotaku.

993
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,740
On where?

994
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,740
Kotaku.

995
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,740
Really?

996
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,980
It was a comment to some random article.

997
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,980
I forget what it was.

998
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:55,300
Oh, I thought you were going to say MySpace.

999
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:59,140
That's interesting because then how would they know that it was a child because Kotaku's

1000
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,060
commenting system doesn't tell a person their age, right?

1001
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,820
Well, here's what's actually funny about this.

1002
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:12,180
The comment immediately preceding that quote was, as a male aged 18 to 35.

1003
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:17,460
And I kid you not, that's exactly what it was.

1004
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,880
And he is quoted as a child in that article.

1005
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,220
So they're totally stretching the facts and stuff.

1006
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,220
Not surprising.

1007
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:30,500
I'll find the web page and shove it in chat just to verify that I'm not pulling this out

1008
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
of nowhere.

1009
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,500
No, I believe you.

1010
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,460
I believe the power of Google is an amazing thing.

1011
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,460
But that's kind of funny.

1012
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:43,420
I just thought that the fact that they just took things totally out of context is rather

1013
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,420
interesting.

1014
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,540
Someone needs to email WPAA and ask them to explain themselves.

1015
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,900
Yeah, and this is almost as good as that one article a year ago about how the PSP pulls

1016
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,100
porn out of thin air.

1017
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,620
Oh, some folks in chat don't know what Kotaku is, so we should say it's a big gaming blog.

1018
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:03,820
If you know Destructoid or even like IGN and GameSpot's news feed, it's very similar.

1019
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,820
It's just a game blog.

1020
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,820
You can put an RSS in your reader and get all their news and stuff.

1021
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,820
That's what Kotaku is.

1022
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,180
I'm sorry, what was the other thing you were saying?

1023
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:19,500
I was saying it's almost as good as the article about a year ago when it said that the PSP

1024
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,980
pulled porn out of thin air.

1025
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,860
It made up porn.

1026
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,860
Exactly.

1027
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:29,660
Like, hey, dude, if the PS3 would pull porn out of thin air, I'd buy it.

1028
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,660
Oh, and no Blu-ray, doesn't it?

1029
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:33,700
Yeah, now we do.

1030
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,100
It actually reminds me of the story where we had the DS.

1031
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,340
And remember that the one TV news station did a story about child predators on the DS

1032
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,340
in PictoChat?

1033
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,100
That's what it reminds me of.

1034
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,220
Too many penis drawings?

1035
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:52,380
No, the fact that like, oh my gosh, your four-year-old might be playing on the Nintendo DS and a

1036
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,740
child predator could write something sexual on it.

1037
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:00,580
But what people forget is that if somebody's doing that, that person is in the room with

1038
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,580
you.

1039
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,300
Those DSes do not have that huge a range.

1040
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,780
I don't know.

1041
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,220
All right, well, anyway, that's all I had to say.

1042
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,340
That's what was going on at E3 a couple of years ago.

1043
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,340
Well, that's different.

1044
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,340
That's E3.

1045
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,980
You put all the nerds in a room and that's what's going to happen.

1046
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,620
All right, Rob D. We appreciate the call.

1047
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,620
Lincoln Chat, by the way.

1048
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,620
What?

1049
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,620
What's that?

1050
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,620
I tossed a Lincoln Chat.

1051
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,620
Oh, great, thank you.

1052
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,620
We'll take a look at that.

1053
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,620
Anyway, thanks for taking my call.

1054
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,620
I'll see you guys later.

1055
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,620
No problem.

1056
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,620
Have a good one, buddy.

1057
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,620
Thanks for the call.

1058
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,620
Model O-L-R phone call.

1059
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:31,380
Yes, it looks like, of course, since I said that, he did cut out a couple times during

1060
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,300
the call, but that's just probably our connection.

1061
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,620
That's all the people playing fucking World of Warcraft in the other room that's causing

1062
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,620
that.

1063
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,620
That's what's up.

1064
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,420
Let's go to another call.

1065
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,740
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1066
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,740
Who's this?

1067
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:46,300
It's everyone's favorite caller, Raven's Dolphin.

1068
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,980
Oh, Raven's Dolphin.

1069
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:52,100
What can we do for you this week, buddy?

1070
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,220
Absolutely nothing.

1071
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,820
I just want to comment on the Wii thing and the PSP thing.

1072
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,220
I just have to say this first.

1073
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:04,980
You're becoming quite the famous little caller of Internet radio programs I'm noticing.

1074
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,620
Yeah, I figured that.

1075
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,460
You should start your own show.

1076
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,900
Not that I'm discouraging you from calling into programs, but it's obvious you have a

1077
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,660
lot to say.

1078
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:23,140
If we haven't proven this fact, any schmo with a microphone can do a show, you should

1079
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,580
think about it.

1080
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,820
I was thinking about it.

1081
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,500
I'm definitely thinking about it.

1082
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,180
It's just the thing about it is money, and can I keep it going for an hour?

1083
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,820
DJ Morpheus says, how about a show of clips of him just calling into other shows?

1084
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,420
That's a brilliant idea.

1085
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,820
I'm just fucking with you, Raven's Dolphin.

1086
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:42,820
What's on your mind, really?

1087
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,820
I'm sorry.

1088
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:49,540
I just want to say that I watched that clip of the Wii, when they talk about the people

1089
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,540
pouring.

1090
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,820
The two girls that had the Wii, they took it in and I pushed pause, and they didn't

1091
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,820
even have the Internet browser.

1092
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,220
I didn't even have the Internet at all.

1093
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,860
Oh, so you watched the clip on the TV site?

1094
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:05,340
You watched a clip of the girls playing with the Wii, and they didn't even have the Internet

1095
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,340
channel on it?

1096
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,340
They didn't even have it, honest.

1097
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:13,940
They went to the news channel like, look, it's a game with the porn, and I don't

1098
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,540
even think they even have Internet.

1099
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:23,300
You have to download it off the Wii, but there are so many different things you have to do.

1100
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:31,060
Your quality is kind of screwing up there, buddy, but damn the media for doing that.

1101
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:35,660
Somebody probably said something to someone, and they create this story around it.

1102
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,660
That's kind of how it works.

1103
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,020
You know, I studied broadcast journalism in college, and I'll tell you what, usually

1104
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,620
what it is is just like, here's an idea, run with it, and make a story out of it.

1105
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,900
So that's what happened.

1106
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,140
Somebody told somebody, hey, did you know the Wii can get porn?

1107
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:53,860
Some reporter did their job and made a compelling story out of it by fabricating a few truths

1108
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,860
here and there.

1109
00:57:54,860 --> 00:58:01,020
Yeah, I just feel like TV is just failing me now.

1110
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,500
You have to take some of the things that you hear on the news with a grain of salt, unfortunately,

1111
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,980
especially these types of investigation stories.

1112
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:11,540
It's one thing to report on a fire that's engulfed an entire neighborhood or whatever,

1113
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:17,260
and it's another thing to report on these types of moral issues.

1114
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,480
I'm hoping to get a live 365 stream soon.

1115
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,780
It's just a matter of money.

1116
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:28,540
Good luck to you, Ravenstaufen, and if you get your own show, we've got your back.

1117
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,540
Thank you.

1118
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,180
I have your back, too.

1119
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,180
We know.

1120
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,740
Have a good one, buddy.

1121
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,740
You too.

1122
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,740
Bye.

1123
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,740
Later.

1124
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,740
All right.

1125
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:38,740
Oop, did I just hang up on someone else?

1126
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,740
Okay, let's go.

1127
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,940
Phone lines are open.

1128
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,500
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1129
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,780
You can always call us on Skype.

1130
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,460
Our username is orangeloungeradio.

1131
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,980
Does anybody have any last-minute stories real quick?

1132
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,820
Interject here in between some calls?

1133
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,680
Yeah, just a couple things real quick.

1134
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:03,820
Mega Man Star Force is actually getting a pretty cool peripheral for the DS, and it's

1135
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:12,300
some sort of card scanning system that they had for Animal Crossing and some other stuff

1136
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:18,780
before, so you can actually plug that in and scan your Mega Man cards to be able to play

1137
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,060
in the role-playing game as well, so that's kind of neat.

1138
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:31,020
And then Eidos has grabbed the rights for Daffy Duck and The O.C., so we're going to

1139
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,020
see some crappy games based on that.

1140
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,020
The O.C.?

1141
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,020
But The O.C. cancelled.

1142
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,020
I don't get it.

1143
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,020
All the perfect time to make a game.

1144
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,380
We're getting another call real quick.

1145
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,380
Let's go to this one.

1146
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,500
This is a conference.

1147
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,900
I'm a little worried about this one, but I guess we'll pick this up anyway.

1148
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm speaking to two people?

1149
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:50,480
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

1150
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,820
My Skype's being glitchy.

1151
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,940
Okay, well, what's up, DMN?

1152
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,340
What's on your mind?

1153
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
Not much.

1154
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,740
I'm calling to defend WarioWare.

1155
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,660
Okay, oh yes, because I didn't give it a negative review.

1156
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,820
I said it's fun, but like most Wariowares, I don't see the magic lasting.

1157
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,460
Well, like most Wariowares, there you go, Rob.

1158
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,340
It's the same thing.

1159
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:15,740
I think everybody in your chat room, everybody who listens to your show, and you including

1160
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,560
myself, I knew that this game was going to have a lot of shit, but it was going to be

1161
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,580
three hours long of gameplay.

1162
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,900
But it's a great party game.

1163
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,280
It is, and I don't disagree with you there.

1164
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,020
So what do you want to defend?

1165
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:33,340
Where am I wrong in my assessment of WarioWare?

1166
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,340
Just because you're stupid.

1167
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,340
No.

1168
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,420
I have to agree with that, too.

1169
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,020
Yeah, I knew it.

1170
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,540
I knew there was two people on the line.

1171
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,540
Rama, you're there, too?

1172
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:50,860
Never mind the fact that there's two people on the line right now, whatever, but what's

1173
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,860
this whole defending WarioWare thing?

1174
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,340
I can't tell you why.

1175
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:00,140
Okay, Rama, you care to chime in on this whole thing?

1176
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:05,060
No, because I haven't played WarioWare yet, but I can say this because of you guys, I

1177
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:08,820
did buy two new games, Luminous Mobile and Cooking Mama.

1178
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,260
Did you hear that, Rama, about Cooking Mama because of us?

1179
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,260
He told me last night.

1180
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,260
Oh, my gosh.

1181
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:15,260
Luminous Mobile!

1182
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:19,100
It's the only mobile game I think I've ever talked good about on this program, so it's

1183
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,100
worth it.

1184
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,100
It's a good buy.

1185
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:25,500
Yeah, I'm paying like $1.99 for it a month, and I'm connected to a server, so top rankings

1186
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,500
and stuff like that.

1187
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,340
I'm like, eh, no big deal.

1188
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:35,580
But another thing about WarioWare, going back to that, is this shows almost everything that

1189
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:42,540
the Wii can do, even more so than Wii Sports did.

1190
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,540
I could rent it and get a lot of that.

1191
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:48,900
You could.

1192
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,900
I think it's worth a buy if you have, like me, I always have people over here.

1193
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,860
I don't know if you get that from OLR, but this place has become party central, and it's

1194
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,820
starting to look like it, too.

1195
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,020
There's people here all the time.

1196
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:05,300
Thusly, WarioWare, Mario Party, those games are excellent buys for me.

1197
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,780
For anybody with a large family or something, I just think for single player people, it's

1198
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,780
going to wear thin.

1199
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:16,420
Yeah, and it's a whole other show to tell you what I've seen strewn about Rob's place.

1200
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,860
One thing I do want to agree with you on, I do think the $50 price tag for that game

1201
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,860
is quite steep.

1202
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:26,740
I think maybe if it was released at $29.99, maybe $39.99, that's kind of pushing the envelope,

1203
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:33,660
but I don't think $49.99 was a good idea, and I don't agree with Nintendo on that decision.

1204
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,820
Well, that's what it is.

1205
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,860
Now I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do on this program, and I'm going

1206
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,740
to hang up on two people at once.

1207
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,620
You suck!

1208
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:45,620
No!

1209
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:52,740
That was fun.

1210
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:56,320
And that would be Pwned, with a capital P, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.

1211
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,320
One more call.

1212
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1213
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,660
It's Legend of Zaku.

1214
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,900
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

1215
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:03,900
What's on your mind, my friend?

1216
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,900
Sure would be complete without a call from you.

1217
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,900
I know.

1218
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,900
God damn.

1219
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,900
We were just wondering when you'd get through.

1220
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,980
It's the first one of the year, though.

1221
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,920
Well, what's up, Zaku?

1222
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:19,500
You know about the whole weed debacle about the DJs going too far and not sure, basically

1223
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:24,020
fucking up when they shouldn't, when they shouldn't, you know, taking diligence.

1224
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1225
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,740
What's the point?

1226
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,900
I mean, I'm not trying to belittle your call, and your opinion is certainly important, but

1227
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,820
God damn if I haven't talked about this issue until I've been blue in the face.

1228
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,620
Remember, Zaku, I live here.

1229
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,500
If you think it's water cooler top where you are, it's like ten times as much where I am,

1230
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,700
because like everybody thinks they knew her.

1231
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:44,460
Right there, it's a local, one of the local things that's happening around the back of

1232
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,460
the woods.

1233
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:52,740
And so, I mean, I could see that they're able to face involuntary manslaughter charges just

1234
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:59,780
for the fact that if you heard the tapes and all the recordings that were actually saved,

1235
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:02,780
you could see on their part that they're just shrugging off people that could have warned

1236
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,260
them and they just, they show no regard.

1237
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:13,180
They said that they had like, they had them sign a liability, you know, waiver.

1238
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:18,540
You know, I go back to what someone in chat said earlier, it's not just the DJs.

1239
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,620
There were ten people that went into making this contest.

1240
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,740
The DJs just egged it on, but that's their job.

1241
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:30,140
Yeah, the people basically, not only the DJs, but the people involved in, you know, organizing

1242
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:36,100
the event, they face, they're going to, they'll face justice eventually.

1243
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,900
And I think in a civil trial, the entire station is going to pay for it.

1244
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:45,120
I wouldn't doubt, I got to be honest, Naku, I wouldn't doubt if that station doesn't go

1245
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,860
through some radical changes.

1246
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,660
I bet you anything that entire, and I'll keep you posted, but I bet you that whole station

1247
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,620
goes down over this.

1248
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,100
They change their name or their look or something, they're going to have to distance themselves

1249
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,100
from this somewhere.

1250
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:02,180
I mean, when it's showing up on the BBC's website that your little local radio station

1251
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:08,580
threw this contest that resulted in the death of someone, that whole station's in for it.

1252
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,580
Right, think about it.

1253
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:13,740
And I'll tell you something else, Naku, it sucks.

1254
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,740
The station sucks.

1255
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:17,180
I mean, I hardly ever listen to it.

1256
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:21,900
It's like Britney Spears and all that kind of crap is what they play on there.

1257
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,340
In New York, they call it Z100.

1258
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,340
Yeah, Z100 essentially.

1259
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,340
Yes.

1260
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,780
Basically, I mean, when you have that, I mean, remember what happened with Opie and Anthony

1261
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:37,580
when they pulled that stunt a few years ago, they got him kicked off a terrestrial radio

1262
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,580
for the first time?

1263
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:41,580
Yeah, but having sex in a church isn't going to kill someone.

1264
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:44,580
The station actually went through a lot of format shifts.

1265
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:46,980
It changed formats throughout the years.

1266
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:53,620
The time of the incident until now has just went through what, a second format change?

1267
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:58,220
So yeah, I mean, they tried their best to distance themselves and what I see in the

1268
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,580
future, I hope not, but I mean...

1269
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,580
Make it quick, Zaku.

1270
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,140
They want this topic banned in chat.

1271
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,140
Final thought.

1272
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,300
It might just reformat the station and that's about it.

1273
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,380
I mean, they will face justice eventually, so, you know, one of these people will end

1274
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,380
up paying.

1275
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,180
Well, we'll keep you here posted on Orange Lounge Radio.

1276
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:20,300
Unless this continues to have nothing to do with gaming, then we probably won't say anything

1277
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,300
at all.

1278
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,300
All right.

1279
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,300
All right, have a good one, Zaku.

1280
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,300
See you later.

1281
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,300
See you later.

1282
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,300
Bye.

1283
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,620
I don't know how you guys feel about this, but my personal thought is I'm willing to

1284
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,660
talk about this as long as it has to do with gaming.

1285
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:36,040
If Nintendo is brought into the suit, then it has to do with gaming, but if it stays

1286
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,820
the way it is, I don't really want to talk about it anymore.

1287
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:38,820
We've said enough.

1288
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,820
Nail in the coffin.

1289
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:40,820
Thank you.

1290
01:06:40,820 --> 01:06:41,820
One more call.

1291
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:42,820
Oh, damn.

1292
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:43,820
It just went away.

1293
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:44,820
Let me have a little call back.

1294
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,820
Any more last minute?

1295
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:48,060
Finish up that thought on the last minute story you had real quick.

1296
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,060
Oh, yeah.

1297
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,940
This is the one that's coming out for the Wii and other game that's being put out that's

1298
01:06:53,940 --> 01:07:02,300
actually going to be kind of like a, what is it, a crazy taxi but with emergency vehicles

1299
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:08,020
called Emergency Mayhem that's being put out by Codemasters, also going to be on the PS2

1300
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,020
and the PSP.

1301
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:12,420
That looks kind of fun.

1302
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,420
That's it.

1303
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,420
That's all I got.

1304
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,420
All right.

1305
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,420
We got our caller again.

1306
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:17,420
Let's go to the phone.

1307
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:18,420
This will be the last one.

1308
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:19,420
Hey, Mario.

1309
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:20,420
Mario Trejo.

1310
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,420
Who's this?

1311
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,420
Hey, ShadowNextGen.

1312
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,420
Hi, ShadowNextGen.

1313
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,420
What's on your mind, my friend?

1314
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:26,940
How's it going, guys?

1315
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,260
Pretty good, you know.

1316
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,260
It goes.

1317
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:30,260
It goes.

1318
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,860
First of all, since I haven't been able to call in for a while, I want to say I really

1319
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,540
enjoyed your appearance on AGI.

1320
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:37,540
Thank you.

1321
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:40,940
We've actually been getting quite a few compliments on that.

1322
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:41,940
That's something else.

1323
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:43,640
You know, we like working with Scott and them.

1324
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,640
It's fun.

1325
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,640
Yeah.

1326
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:51,180
I thought tomorrow's show should be funny if Scott shows up since his Patriots lost.

1327
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,880
You know, I don't really follow football, but yeah, I do know he was pretty passionate

1328
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,260
about the game tonight, so that should be interesting.

1329
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,620
But aren't they off all week?

1330
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,780
They have a show tomorrow, I believe, and then they're off.

1331
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:04,780
Interesting.

1332
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,780
All right.

1333
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:09,620
Well, what's on your mind tonight in regards to gaming?

1334
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:14,780
I was curious about – it was actually a comment, I think it was AGI made a while back.

1335
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:18,260
It was either AGI or you guys, because I listened to both of you a lot.

1336
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,900
They were worried about with the Wii's price point – this was back in October, September

1337
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:26,100
– about how since Nintendo was supposed to have all of these different consoles, how

1338
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:31,380
you would be able to walk into a store and find anyone with no problem, and therefore

1339
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,980
they thought there would be a problem because people would see it as, you know, since it's

1340
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:38,380
already there, you know, it wasn't really that good or it wasn't that hot of an item

1341
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,380
type of thing.

1342
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:44,120
I can't remember if we said that or – I don't think that we would have said that,

1343
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:48,900
because my kind of viewpoint on it is that I think, you know, a little bit of demand

1344
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,340
is a good thing, but this is too much.

1345
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,340
This is too much.

1346
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,340
This is exactly what Microsoft went through, you know?

1347
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,340
Yeah.

1348
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,340
Yeah.

1349
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,780
Well, no, I was just kind of curious about what your thoughts were as how people were

1350
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:03,180
predicting now what happens, and now the exact opposite has happened where you cannot find

1351
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:07,700
a Wii anywhere, but you can almost walk into any store and find a PS3.

1352
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,700
Yeah.

1353
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,340
You know, but I wonder how much – I don't have any sales stats, I don't know, but

1354
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,140
how much of this is Nintendo making?

1355
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:16,660
I mean, how has production been at the Wiis?

1356
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:17,660
Been pretty low.

1357
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:21,060
Yeah, because what I understand is that we all have this impression that the Wiis are

1358
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,620
just rolling off the freaking assembly line, but I believe I heard somewhere else that

1359
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:27,980
the actual amount of shipments that these places are getting are not weekly.

1360
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:32,180
No, they're not weekly, and I want to say the last shipment we got was in December.

1361
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,180
The next one we're getting is this week, and that's how long it's been.

1362
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,100
It's been a few weeks since we've gotten anything, and it's because they're sold

1363
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,100
out.

1364
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:45,860
They're sold out of DS, they're sold out of Zelda, the GameCube Zelda.

1365
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:47,860
They're just way behind in everything.

1366
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,460
They're too damn popular.

1367
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:52,980
And the thing with the PS3 being in stock is not because they're shipping a ton of

1368
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,540
units, it's because they're not selling as many units as they're shipping.

1369
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:59,660
They're just getting, you know, shipments every now and then, but they're just not

1370
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,660
selling them.

1371
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:04,140
It's not the hot item they thought it would be, or at least not yet.

1372
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:08,020
Well, the system's not going to sell very well if there's only 13 games out for it,

1373
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,540
so that's a problem.

1374
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:15,020
Out of curiosity, are you a Wii or PlayStation 3 owner yourself?

1375
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,340
A Wii and a 360.

1376
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,260
Ah, so you're a Wii 60 camp.

1377
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,900
Any interest in PS3?

1378
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,620
Excuse me?

1379
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:24,740
Any interest in PS3?

1380
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,260
Maybe down the line.

1381
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:31,580
It will depend on how many more exclusively Sony.

1382
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,140
You sound just like me.

1383
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:39,900
All I need to hear is basically a Final Fantasy or a Kingdom Hearts on the 360, and I might

1384
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:41,100
be done with Sony.

1385
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,620
Yeah, I know.

1386
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:48,700
If Square came out tomorrow and announced Kingdom Hearts 3 for the 360, put a fork in

1387
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,500
Sony as far as I'm concerned.

1388
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,500
But I don't know.

1389
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,180
Again, I say that kind of jokingly on here, but I don't know.

1390
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:02,060
Let's not forget that Katamari Damacy was a very excellent, albeit third-party, exclusive

1391
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,060
game.

1392
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,060
I guess all these games are third-party exclusives.

1393
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,060
They went over to Sony.

1394
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:10,140
It was just an awesome game, and PS2 took a little while to build up some steam.

1395
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,540
I didn't buy a PS2 on launch day.

1396
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:13,540
I didn't buy one for a while.

1397
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:16,060
I don't think I bought one until Final Fantasy X came out.

1398
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:19,460
I didn't get one until the Slim Units came out was when I got my PS2.

1399
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,460
Oh, you know what?

1400
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,660
I had an import one for the longest time.

1401
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,660
That's what it was.

1402
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:26,900
Well, anyhow, anything else you want to share with tonight's program?

1403
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,860
Yeah, I had another question for you guys.

1404
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:33,220
I know it's probably a little late, but I was wondering if there was any particular

1405
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:40,700
game or series in 2006 that you guys wanted to play but didn't get to?

1406
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:46,300
Any particular series or game in 2006 that we wanted to play but didn't get to?

1407
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,860
That you didn't have the time to get to or whatnot?

1408
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:54,460
Maybe something you were looking forward to but you just didn't get to it for whatever

1409
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:55,740
reason?

1410
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,780
How about games that I didn't spend enough time with that I wanted to spend more time

1411
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,780
with?

1412
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,780
Trauma Center.

1413
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,560
Yeah, well, I actually did play a lot of Trauma Center.

1414
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,800
The Final Fantasy games, like I played 12 enough to know that I put in a pretty good

1415
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,800
chunk of hours.

1416
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,140
I went after the double digits and hours, but I wish I could spend more time with that

1417
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,380
and I needed to play Final Fantasy III enough.

1418
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:21,400
I never did get Cooking Mama and Jamie won't shut up about it, so I know I needed to check

1419
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,740
that one out.

1420
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:28,380
I'm trying to think what other franchises.

1421
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:29,500
Not a lot coming to mind.

1422
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,180
I have played most of the stuff I wanted to play.

1423
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,780
Probably PC gaming and I think a lot of the stuff on PC.

1424
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,860
You know Sam and Max, those original games?

1425
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,780
I heard a lot of good stuff about them and even a GameTap subscriber just haven't had

1426
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,780
the time to check those out.

1427
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,500
I've heard a lot of good things about them, so that's on my to-do list.

1428
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,860
So I guess that's my answer, Sam and Max.

1429
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:54,340
Have any of you guys tried out the Shadow Hearts RPG series?

1430
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:57,060
I've heard of it and I've heard really good things about it and I have a friend who's

1431
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,280
playing it, but I haven't played it myself.

1432
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,300
Is that something you think ought to be on my list?

1433
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,540
Yeah, they're excellent games.

1434
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,620
They have three of them out now.

1435
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,700
I don't know how well they sell.

1436
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:11,260
They sell well enough to where the sequels have been coming out, but I think it's one

1437
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:14,980
of them that flies under a lot of people's radar for whatever reason.

1438
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:15,980
Are those on GameCube?

1439
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:16,980
PS2.

1440
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:17,980
A PS2?

1441
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,180
I am thinking of something else.

1442
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:21,180
I've heard of it.

1443
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,180
I've heard of it, too.

1444
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,180
I haven't really played it.

1445
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,180
I still wanted to play it, Connie.

1446
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,180
Yeah, you guys should try to have enough time if you can.

1447
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:30,300
Like I said, there are three games and they are a lot of fun, especially if you do RPGs.

1448
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,640
They're kind of a little off the wall.

1449
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:37,460
They have somewhat of a historical perspective, but then a lot of it is they spun history,

1450
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,740
so there's fiction in it, too.

1451
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,740
Send some info to my email.

1452
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:42,740
I'll check it out.

1453
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,500
I'll at least rent it if nothing else.

1454
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,500
Yeah, okay.

1455
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:50,020
And then once fixed on it, then I'll clear the line for you guys.

1456
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,020
Yup.

1457
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:55,620
Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play pre-orders being sold out with GameStop and EB?

1458
01:13:55,620 --> 01:14:00,020
Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play bundles being sold out with GameStop and EB?

1459
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,020
Yup.

1460
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,380
What do you think of that?

1461
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,380
What do I think of that?

1462
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:06,220
Do you know anybody else who's doing pre-orders for that?

1463
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:11,220
Yeah, I know a lot of local mom and pop stores are doing pre-orders because I know we got

1464
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:18,860
our allocations, and we got quite a bit of units allocated to us, so I'm surprised that

1465
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,540
they're sold out already.

1466
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,700
I'm hearing Wii Play's not worth it unless you need the controller.

1467
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,140
That's what it is.

1468
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:30,300
Everyone's getting in for the controller, and it's basically almost like a free game

1469
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,300
with it.

1470
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,300
Alright, well...

1471
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,300
But it's $50, right?

1472
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,300
Isn't it $49.99?

1473
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,300
No, that's right.

1474
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,300
I thought it was $39.99.

1475
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,300
Is it $39?

1476
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,300
No, that's $40.

1477
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,300
I'm wrong.

1478
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,300
$49.99.

1479
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:46,060
Alright, well, thanks for taking my call, guys, and I'm a big fan as always.

1480
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,060
No problem.

1481
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,460
We appreciate the call and the game recommendation.

1482
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,460
Have a good one, buddy.

1483
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,460
Yeah, talk to you later.

1484
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,460
Later.

1485
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:53,460
Yup.

1486
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,620
You know, like I said, we have day jobs and all that stuff.

1487
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,260
We can't always get around to playing everything, but we try.

1488
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,700
Between the three of us, we play an awful lot.

1489
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:05,220
I like to play a lot of types of role-playing games, although somehow I missed that one.

1490
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:10,580
Loki likes to play the shoot-and-kill-the-hooker type games, and Jamie likes to play really

1491
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,660
weird shit.

1492
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,500
I don't play weird shit.

1493
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,820
No, you like to play Kingdom Hearts, that's what you like to play.

1494
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:17,820
Yes, I do.

1495
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:23,820
I was going to say, there's a funny website I read about today, I forgot to mention.

1496
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,500
TheBigBoxProject.com.

1497
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:37,300
It's about this guy who sent back a console, an Xbox 360 console, to Microsoft originally,

1498
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:43,420
and the problem is they sent it back and it's still busted, so now between the time he sent

1499
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:46,500
the first one in and the second one needs to go back, they've changed their policy and

1500
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,940
they want him to pay to have it fixed or whatever, so he's like, okay, fine, if that's the case,

1501
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:55,580
I'm going to send this in the biggest fucking box I can find.

1502
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:04,660
So he's trying to pay to get one of those rail car crates, the big giant rail cars to

1503
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:11,700
deliver this thing in, and it's funny because on the website if you go to it, it has a little

1504
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,060
dialogue on here, it says, how big is your repair center?

1505
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:19,660
And then their technician's like, I don't see how that pertains to the situation, sir,

1506
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:25,380
because I'm going to send you my broken Xbox in the biggest damn box you've ever seen.

1507
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,380
Will it be filled with little styrofoam pellets?

1508
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,940
That's what I want to know.

1509
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,460
I can only hope.

1510
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:40,860
Can you imagine, somebody pokes a little hole in the box and suddenly they're under a mountain

1511
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:45,980
of styrofoam pellets.

1512
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,460
Can you wrap the Xbox in that much bubble wrap?

1513
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:52,500
It should be wrapped in duct tape, solid duct tape.

1514
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:57,060
That would be a better use of your money right there, is to take the box and wrap the whole

1515
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:05,420
box in two feet of duct tape, two feet thick, and that would be awesome to send.

1516
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,380
Sounds like a Daffy Duck cartoon, sorry, I'm just imagining the opening.

1517
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:11,580
You wouldn't even be able to cut through it, you'd have to saw through it to get to the

1518
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:12,580
Xbox.

1519
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:13,580
Wow.

1520
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:17,460
Of course, if I were just them, I'd just be like, return to sender, bitch.

1521
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:26,780
Any last minute stories from you, Dark Sakura?

1522
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:27,780
Not I.

1523
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,780
No?

1524
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,780
How's it going?

1525
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:30,780
You've been kind of quiet tonight.

1526
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,780
You okay?

1527
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,780
Yeah, I'm okay.

1528
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,780
Just making sure.

1529
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,780
Need a hug?

1530
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,780
No, I need food.

1531
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:36,780
Eat some coffee.

1532
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,780
Well, food, sounds good.

1533
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,780
No coffee, I have to sleep eventually.

1534
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,820
Well, to get to the food, we have to get to our final thoughts, because we've got to wrap

1535
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,380
this thing up.

1536
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:44,940
Thank you guys so much for listening to us.

1537
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:48,700
Let's go around and get the final thoughts, Loki.

1538
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:53,020
My final thought is, I need to play more Resistance.

1539
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:56,420
My final thought is, I'm getting my PlayStation 2 back from my friend, because I have this

1540
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,980
urge to play Kingdom Hearts ever since I got back from Disneyland.

1541
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,700
Damn Disneyland, damn it.

1542
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:06,380
Also, do you know I subscribed to video podcasts this week that talk about Disneyland?

1543
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,900
And yeah, that's pretty sad.

1544
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,220
I'm turning into Jamie.

1545
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:16,500
Jamie, your final thought, you need some gas X?

1546
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,500
No.

1547
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,900
You don't have anything else to say?

1548
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,140
You don't have a certain phrase you say every week on the show?

1549
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,140
Kiss my ass.

1550
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:31,020
You're not going to say to reject?

1551
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:32,020
Kiss my ass.

1552
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:33,020
All right, fine.

1553
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,020
I'm just checking.

1554
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:35,820
Want to make sure that's the official final thought.

1555
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:39,820
All right, bend over.

1556
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:43,260
Thank you so much, everybody, for tuning into and downloading our podcast and supporting

1557
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,900
independent internet radio.

1558
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,540
You guys are awesome for doing so.

1559
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:51,340
If you would be so kind to leave us a kind review on iTunes or dig our program over on

1560
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:56,020
dig.com or just tell a friend is really the best thing you could do, because if you tell

1561
01:18:56,020 --> 01:19:00,620
a friend about our program, then that's how we stay in business, because we don't have

1562
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:04,060
those marketing dollars behind us, because we're po like you.

1563
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:07,400
Well, if you aren't poor, then send us money.

1564
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:30,420
On that note, have a great night, and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
