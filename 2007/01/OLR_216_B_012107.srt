00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:19,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:20,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Mikhail Tov,

5
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:54,885
[SPEAKER_12]: was guesting with us during Part A, but he's actually having to take off, so he won't be around for Part B. So bye-bye, Miklatov.

6
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,266
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're going to get back into some news.

7
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:59,207
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?

8
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:01,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to.

9
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:01,627
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to.

10
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:03,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I have to?

11
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:03,768
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to.

12
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:04,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

13
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:13,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there is a game to be coming out called Flow that had a December 6 release date.

14
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:14,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say had.

15
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:16,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

16
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:16,189
[SPEAKER_07]: February.

17
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:45,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

18
00:01:45,893 --> 00:01:48,193
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a very anticipated online title, though, you know.

19
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,414
[SPEAKER_12]: I played the little online one.

20
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:49,894
[SPEAKER_12]: It's cute.

21
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:51,494
[SPEAKER_12]: It should be interesting on a PS3.

22
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:54,635
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of reminds me of, I don't know, Electroplankton for some weird reason.

23
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:55,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Electroplankton.

24
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:56,175
[SPEAKER_01]: It just does.

25
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:57,595
[SPEAKER_12]: It kind of reminds me of that for some weird reason.

26
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:06,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of music games, actually, I want to interject this because I forgot to... I left this out of How Was My Gaming Week, and I don't think it's in our show role tonight.

27
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:13,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a chance, and I can't say how, but I had a chance to play the Dance MMO that's in closed beta right now.

28
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,403
[SPEAKER_12]: and so I want to give you my thoughts on it.

29
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:17,924
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of interesting.

30
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:23,569
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a couple licensed songs in it and then the rest of it is all normal stuff.

31
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,411
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course it's set up very similar to DDR.

32
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:33,960
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a mix between DDR and one of those online Korean or Japanese games that people play like R2-B, O2 Jam, those things.

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,002
[SPEAKER_12]: The interface really reminds me of that.

34
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:39,325
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it was developed by one of those companies because it shows the logo there in the beginning.

35
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:41,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed a couple of licensed songs.

36
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,086
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a Madonna song in there, but an old one.

37
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:44,667
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was like Papa Don't Preach was in there.

38
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:49,988
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, of course, I remember Jump Around, Jump Around, Jump Up, Jump Up was in there, that song.

39
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:53,409
[SPEAKER_12]: But some of the steps are pretty atrocious.

40
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,269
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I noticed.

41
00:02:54,309 --> 00:03:01,492
[SPEAKER_12]: It starts getting to be very in-the-groove level difficulty when you get up pretty high, which on your fingers is... I'm serious.

42
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:04,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of these steps are just too crazy.

43
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,453
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like finger-finger mania or something.

44
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:07,658
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a... I had a...

45
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Fairly okay time with it.

46
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Screams polished to me.

47
00:03:30,985 --> 00:03:33,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope they don't... No, I think they're going to add more stuff to it.

48
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:36,210
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hear it's changing a lot.

49
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you'll notice things get added and disappear.

50
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:39,953
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think they're still putting some tweaks on it.

51
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:43,115
[SPEAKER_12]: There's probably some more songs that have yet to go into it.

52
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:49,000
[SPEAKER_12]: And I imagine... They're probably still trying to figure out what the model's going to be.

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:57,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pretty sure the game is going to be free, which I hope it is, because I couldn't see myself paying much more than, like, ten bucks for it.

54
00:03:57,577 --> 00:04:05,259
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand there might be licenses in the game and stuff, but the game itself just not... I mean, how many people play DDR on the PC?

55
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:07,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Not enough, in my opinion.

56
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:19,844
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really tough when there's a big DDR simulator out there that's free and has thousands upon thousands of tracks freely available out there.

57
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:24,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so anyway, I just wanted to say that.

58
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:27,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a chance to look at the beta and that's what's going on with it.

59
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:29,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, back to the news.

60
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,340
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura had brought up Flow for the PlayStation 3.

61
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:36,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Another game that was being anticipated for the PlayStation 3 was Warhawk.

62
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:48,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there was a rumor, and I emphasize rumor going on right now, that Warhawk could actually turn into a PS3 downloadable title instead, just like a Gran Turismo HD.

63
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:51,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe they did confirm saying that it was not canceled.

64
00:04:51,956 --> 00:04:53,017
[SPEAKER_12]: It was not canceled.

65
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:53,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's good.

66
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,781
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be interesting if you have all these games that are kind of going down that path.

67
00:04:58,223 --> 00:04:59,385
[SPEAKER_12]: PlayStation 3 discs have been dumped to ISOs

68
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:18,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Making way for a whole new brand of piracy for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

69
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:24,828
[SPEAKER_14]: PlayStation 3 I can see because it's Blu-ray and the system has a hard drive built into it.

70
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:31,191
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm seeing something pretty similar to what happened with the PlayStation 2 happening with the PlayStation 3.

71
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:37,394
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, Kraken Group Paradox has dumped the first ISO.

72
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Not yet playable, but they've still dumped it and it's only a matter of time.

73
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:46,120
[SPEAKER_14]: of MotorStorm, the Japanese ISO for that.

74
00:05:46,980 --> 00:06:01,288
[SPEAKER_14]: And right now they're saying that the first few sectors of the PlayStation 3 image are special and may contain the decryption keys for the executables, but right now they still haven't figured out exactly how to run stuff yet.

75
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:11,373
[SPEAKER_14]: On the other front, though, with the Wii, there's actually been a program released to be able to dump that, and I believe it's two freely available programs

76
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:39,949
[SPEAKER_14]: to be able to dump those one of course is called DVD Info Pro that's available out there right now and then there's another program that you use once you have that to raw to dump and they'll dump an image of the Wii DVD but of course once again they haven't figured out how to run those yet either but that's half the battle is dumping the disc and the other half is getting it on there and playing it so it's only a matter of time

77
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:44,217
[SPEAKER_12]: So how long before we see fully pirated Wii and PS3 games available on the internet?

78
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:45,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably a few months.

79
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,280
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii's kind of tricky because it's really hard to read those discs.

80
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,081
[SPEAKER_14]: A normal computer can't read them.

81
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:57,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure about the Blu-ray ROMs for the PS3, but I know that the Wii ones are pretty hard.

82
00:06:58,006 --> 00:06:59,487
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

83
00:06:59,588 --> 00:06:59,908
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

84
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully, I don't know.

85
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:09,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Sony's protection in the past has been pretty crappy, so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this stuff pretty soon.

86
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:11,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2

87
00:07:33,866 --> 00:07:34,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Going on there.

88
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:40,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And also a game called Super Probotector, which in the U.S.

89
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:44,248
[SPEAKER_07]: is Contra 3, which is so unfair because I want Contra 3.

90
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:48,389
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an 800 Wii point game.

91
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:50,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Good one.

92
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,671
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to check it out, let me know how good it pulls over.

93
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:58,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I've been pleased with everything that's come out for virtual console as far as, I mean, they still have Flickr.

94
00:07:58,572 --> 00:07:59,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's fantastic.

95
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:02,033
[SPEAKER_07]: But those are new ones coming out.

96
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:03,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky.

97
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:05,647
[SPEAKER_12]: I want Super Contra 3

98
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:35,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Virtual Console, that's coming out soon at least.

99
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:41,867
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I know they were showing... Well, Kid Icarus was on there a while ago.

100
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:42,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Mighty Bomb Jack.

101
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:45,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Xevious.

102
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

103
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Jewel Quest 2.

104
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:52,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's... Xevious was in last week's releases.

105
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:55,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's probably a full game, the Jewel Quest 2 thing.

106
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:57,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

107
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,711
[SPEAKER_12]: What about the Nintendo Originals?

108
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Weren't there supposed to be original virtual console things coming out?

109
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, wasn't there supposed to be online play as well?

110
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:12,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, it'll come eventually, like eons away from now.

111
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:14,273
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess all in good time.

112
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:15,193
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

113
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:28,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, now, another very interesting story going around about the Wii is that, you know, of course, there's always these, I don't know what you'd call them, parental groups that want to prevent anybody from having fun.

114
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:40,507
[SPEAKER_12]: WFAA has put out this thing going out that says that, hey, look, the Wii and the PlayStation 3 can get on the Internet.

115
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:46,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Therefore, your kids are accessing pornography through the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

116
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:57,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, how easy is it that you can go on and you can go click-click on, you know, Pornotube or something and go access some pornography?

117
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:04,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually looking at the website here that says, oh my gosh, these games are internet access.

118
00:10:04,877 --> 00:10:06,238
[SPEAKER_12]: They're gateways to pornography.

119
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:10,821
[SPEAKER_12]: They can play WarioWare, Guitar Hero, because that's what I play on PlayStation 3 as well, and pornography.

120
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,063
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the pornography game.

121
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,203
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a quote here in this article.

122
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Quote, they're innocent and we want to try and keep them that way.

123
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,526
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very upsetting something this popular.

124
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,968
[SPEAKER_12]: A kid game can go that direction so quickly.

125
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:24,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, shut up, stupid kid.

126
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:31,877
[SPEAKER_12]: And even in this story, in a blog, one child boasted, the first thing I thought of when I downloaded the Wii browser was also porn.

127
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:36,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm sure it was really a child that was blogging about that shit.

128
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if they were under 18, you'd see a 17-year-old would be considered a child.

129
00:10:39,382 --> 00:10:44,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, it's the same damn thing as the computer, right?

130
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:45,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

131
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:48,869
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have a PC in your house, that is also a gateway to porn.

132
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,834
[SPEAKER_12]: So monitor your kids' Wii and PS3 use just like you do their PC use.

133
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:56,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Duh.

134
00:10:56,695 --> 00:10:57,435
[SPEAKER_12]: How hard is that?

135
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:00,037
[SPEAKER_12]: That kind of pisses me off that people are trying to spin this.

136
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,780
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, oh my gosh, the Wii has chicks doing it on it.

137
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's just like saying, you know, oh, eating McDonald's is going to make you fat.

138
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:10,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Then the next week later, oh, eating Burger King is going to make you fat.

139
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Then the next week later, oh, Taco Bell is going to make you fat.

140
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:15,569
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all gateways to fatness.

141
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:23,696
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, well, it's just fucking stupid bitches that need the fucking attention and they...

142
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:28,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Every news outlet seems to do this kind of shit too.

143
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:33,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, it's because they don't have news and they need something to fill space.

144
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,299
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it fucking is.

145
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,583
[SPEAKER_14]: And if there's another device that comes out there that has the internet on it, oh my god, it's a gateway to porn.

146
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:46,566
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, there's fucking goddamn child safety stuff on there.

147
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:52,329
[SPEAKER_14]: They even had the update to block the internet before the internet browser was even available.

148
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:56,826
[SPEAKER_14]: and the weather too, because my god, there can be some pornography in the weather.

149
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:01,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I remember that one time there was the topless weather girl on the weather channel.

150
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is something completely different.

151
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:11,018
[SPEAKER_14]: They have, the tools are there for the parents to use, and it's just the parents are being stupid.

152
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:12,439
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's all it is.

153
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And because, for one, I mean, pulling up porn on the Wii is fucking slow.

154
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:22,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, granted, you can do it, but they have the parental controls on there.

155
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, lots of good comments from chat.

156
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:27,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, live on this Sunday evening on this topic.

157
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,942
[SPEAKER_12]: DDRDollarBill says, Fuck, the cell phone is the gateway to the internet, thus it can get on porno sites.

158
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:36,523
[SPEAKER_12]: James Patrick says, Well, there's porn sites built for the Wii.

159
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:39,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, people, you know, kind of catering to that whole thing.

160
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,945
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, looking at this, well, let's see.

161
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:42,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

162
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:50,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Blackboy says there are also programs that restrict what websites can be accessed on the computer, but we don't really see anything like that on the Wii yet.

163
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's called the parental controls.

164
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that work on websites too?

165
00:12:56,024 --> 00:12:57,425
[SPEAKER_14]: It blocks the whole internet.

166
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:58,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

167
00:12:59,147 --> 00:12:59,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Very interesting.

168
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:01,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, somebody else said here...

169
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:07,103
[SPEAKER_12]: S2H makes this groaner These parents are probably the same types who would let people drink two gallons of water in a short time

170
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:27,793
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

171
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:58,005
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU of the week goes towards distance.

172
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:04,851
[SPEAKER_07]: And knowing that two people that I care an awful lot about are separated by it right now.

173
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:10,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't know what else to say.

174
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:15,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, that I hope they hang in there and can't wait to see them together again.

175
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm talking about Chris and Megzi, so.

176
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:22,304
[SPEAKER_12]: The official OLR lesbians will be reunited again soon.

177
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:22,924
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they will.

178
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:23,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, Loki!

179
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:30,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, fuck you to your neighbors, because they're dumb little kids that won't fucking get out of the way of cars.

180
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:35,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm sitting there trying to park my car, and they're playing football in the middle of the street, in the dark, by the way.

181
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and they won't fucking move.

182
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:46,063
[SPEAKER_14]: So, fuck them, and I'm glad I ran over your fucking toy last week, stupid bitches, and I will run you over if you get in my car's way again.

183
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:51,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Jvmon in chat's yelling, please tell me Loki ran someone over, please tell me.

184
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I started with a toy truck, so, uh... It's just the enabler.

185
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:07,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, uh, my FU of the week goes to, uh, my office chair, which is now sitting in the corner of the room, broken, because it snapped in two places when my fat ass plopped in it the other day.

186
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:15,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelly pointed out, though, it's quite funny, because it is now the hoopty chair, because you can sit in, and fuckin' just like, feel, yeah.

187
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,488
[SPEAKER_12]: You can kinda lean back, cause there's not, yeah, one of the arms is off

188
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,400
[SPEAKER_12]: But a big thank you to Duct Tape, which I think will fix my chair soon.

189
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, DarkSakura did say I could probably get a new one pretty cheap at Ikea, and it would look better than Duct Tape.

190
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:29,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do love me some Ikea.

191
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:31,165
[SPEAKER_12]: I need an excuse to go there.

192
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Ikea is rad.

193
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:36,208
[SPEAKER_14]: I recommend, though, Duct Tape might fix DarkSakura's chair.

194
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of Duct Tape.

195
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I've tried to fix this chair with Duct Tape.

196
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,113
[SPEAKER_12]: We should just cover the whole chair in Duct Tape.

197
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,635
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I don't want to be squeaky.

198
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:47,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll get another chair soon, but that seems funny.

199
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,237
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like a fart.

200
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and F you to dental bills.

201
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God.

202
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:56,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate when I go to the dentist, I feel like I'm going to a used car salesman.

203
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:58,619
[SPEAKER_12]: They're trying to talk me into, like, all this crap I don't need.

204
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:03,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like, you know, like, if I don't do it, then, um, frickin', my teeth are all gonna fall out.

205
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:04,900
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that's not true.

206
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,020
[SPEAKER_12]: They're trying... Give this.

207
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,681
[SPEAKER_12]: My dentist is trying to get me to upgrade to a $1,000 crown.

208
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,421
[SPEAKER_12]: A crown that costs $1,000.

209
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:14,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they say my insurance will only cover a tin can.

210
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:16,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I have a $1,000 crown.

211
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:16,582
[SPEAKER_07]: But I...

212
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,574
[SPEAKER_12]: But how much... Did you pay for all of that out of pocket?

213
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Paid $500 of it.

214
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,576
[SPEAKER_12]: See, my insurance won't pay for any of it.

215
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:25,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Sucks.

216
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:31,419
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole reason I have the one I did is because it was absolute necessity because it was my back molar that broke.

217
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,860
[SPEAKER_07]: The root broke.

218
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had to have the whole thing filled out.

219
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:35,501
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, no.

220
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,442
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not my situation.

221
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:42,285
[SPEAKER_07]: See, don't feel bad about having the 10-1 when it could be a little lot worse.

222
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:43,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.

223
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:46,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway...

224
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,307
[SPEAKER_12]: and I'll see you next time.

225
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:12,325
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to eat twice the amount of animals to make up for the vegetarians.

226
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:12,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways.

227
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:41,275
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

228
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:01,134
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

229
00:18:25,243 --> 00:18:28,585
[SPEAKER_14]: HD DVD sounds like the way it's going to go, at least for the porn industry.

230
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,787
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you have a 360, there you go, some porn.

231
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:37,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I do recommend, though, if you are going to watch porn on the PS3, just dump it to your hard drive.

232
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:40,173
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, though?

233
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,774
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to be honest.

234
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:46,357
[SPEAKER_12]: If they do go to HD DVD, which it sounds like they're going to do, this is it.

235
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:46,777
[SPEAKER_12]: It's over.

236
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Format Wars are over.

237
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:51,640
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what ended VHS and beta, when porn went to VHS.

238
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:52,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

239
00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:01,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, though, they make a good point that if it's cheaper to produce, then the disc prices are going to be cheaper.

240
00:19:01,964 --> 00:19:06,006
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, the retail for disc prices isn't any cheaper than Blu-ray.

241
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:15,452
[SPEAKER_14]: So it comes down to the bottom line of price, what it's going to cost these companies and what kind of a margin they can make on this stuff because it's cheaper to produce for.

242
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:17,013
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's going to be the same quality...

243
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Then, yeah, I think HD DVD is going to win out.

244
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,323
[SPEAKER_12]: This is why I'm simply saying the format wars are over.

245
00:19:22,403 --> 00:19:28,707
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't mean to keep dogging on Sony, but look, the evident... Look, when the porn industry, and, you know, who doesn't love some porn?

246
00:19:28,987 --> 00:19:31,849
[SPEAKER_12]: When they go for HD DVD, that's it.

247
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:35,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Sony's really kind of known for failed formats anyways.

248
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:40,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, let's see here, Betamax, UMD... Kick them while they're down, Loki.

249
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:41,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Kick them while they're down.

250
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:47,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, hey, you know, I support Sony just as much, but... It's there.

251
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

252
00:19:50,238 --> 00:20:01,183
[SPEAKER_07]: In New York State, Representative Keith Wright proposed legislation to block the sales of games that depict racist and religious violence to minors.

253
00:20:02,264 --> 00:20:17,431
[SPEAKER_07]: The bill is A00547, and if it passed, it will block the sales of those games that advocate or glamorize violent crime, suicide, sexual violence, violent racism, religious violence, and illegal use of drugs or alcohol.

254
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:23,179
[SPEAKER_07]: He's also called for retailers to play such games in an adults only section.

255
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers would be required to check IDs for buyers under 30.

256
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:38,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, the problem I have with this, who checks what games meet this criteria?

257
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:40,908
[SPEAKER_12]: What is considered violent?

258
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:42,389
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we have the ESRB.

259
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that, but I don't like it when I see these bills and they're so vague on

260
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:52,694
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to put violent games behind a closed curtain.

261
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:53,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what's a violent game?

262
00:20:54,216 --> 00:21:02,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this one actually has been going a bit more to define it, to define the violence at any rate.

263
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:16,352
[SPEAKER_07]: However, racism is... I mean, basically anybody can get offended over something if it remotely sounds racist to them, so I don't see how it's, you know... And it works both ways, too.

264
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:16,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it...

265
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:26,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, honestly, again, it's not the place of our government to decide what gets sold to who.

266
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:32,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's the job of the parents to take a more active role in what their children are playing.

267
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:39,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to them, look in every so often, but in the end, it's not the place of our government to decide.

268
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:41,333
[SPEAKER_07]: We already have rating systems.

269
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Most retailers already...

270
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:49,670
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't sell anything that's rated M to a minor, so why is this necessary?

271
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,891
[SPEAKER_07]: All this is is wasting more taxpayer money.

272
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:56,052
[SPEAKER_12]: If we hadn't done the FUs previously.

273
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, anyway, moving on.

274
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:01,074
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to talk a little bit about PC gaming.

275
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:05,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, one of our New Year's resolutions was we were going to give some more love to PC gaming, and well,

276
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:09,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Technically, this is about Mac gaming, but that's okay.

277
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:10,534
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, PC is personal computer.

278
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:10,975
[SPEAKER_12]: It's everything.

279
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:19,182
[SPEAKER_12]: So, some Mac fans are going to be in luck because it sounds like GameTap is planning to port Myst Online over to the Mac.

280
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:24,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, Myst Online is going to be getting a whole new world to explore.

281
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,890
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of weird, though, because GameTap is actually not available on the Mac.

282
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,712
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of people say that's what's stopping them from getting on GameTap.

283
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:35,495
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, if GameTap could bring their pretty big library over to the Mac, that would be something else.

284
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:40,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Trans Gaming is going to be the company that's actually going to bring the title over to the Mac.

285
00:22:40,878 --> 00:22:42,239
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's kind of cool.

286
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,341
[SPEAKER_12]: No release as of yet.

287
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:45,742
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just announced that it's happening.

288
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:50,506
[SPEAKER_12]: But those folks who were looking into getting into Myst Online, there you have it.

289
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:52,688
[SPEAKER_12]: You can do that on the Mac if you are so inclined.

290
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:54,209
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

291
00:22:55,731 --> 00:22:59,133
[SPEAKER_14]: One cool game that's going to be coming to the PC, Monster Hunter.

292
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:02,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a real huge franchise in the United States, but it is pretty big over in Japan.

293
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:04,178
[SPEAKER_14]: This

294
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:05,922
[SPEAKER_14]: I like to see that.

295
00:23:32,136 --> 00:23:35,438
[SPEAKER_14]: or even a PlayStation 2 release of the ones that they have in Japan.

296
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,399
[SPEAKER_12]: It was on the PS2 a while back, I think.

297
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure in the United States, but I know it was in Japan.

298
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:42,842
[SPEAKER_14]: They've had a few in Japan.

299
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:44,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

300
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:52,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was the one on PS2 because I remember seeing it at Dan's old store.

301
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:59,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at any rate, as far as other games, there's a

302
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:06,124
[SPEAKER_07]: The Battlefield 2142 Northern Strike for the PC being worked on right now.

303
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:07,485
[SPEAKER_07]: EA has announced it.

304
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:13,931
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a booster pack being worked on by EA Digital Illusions Studio in Stockholm.

305
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, it's Swedish.

306
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's scheduled for release in March 2007.

307
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:23,119
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a futuristic conflict game.

308
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:27,247
[SPEAKER_07]: that's following a second Ice Age.

309
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:44,224
[SPEAKER_07]: They've released more details on the story, but it's also going to include three new maps, the World War II battle scene at the bridge of Remagen, Alpine, Titan, and a liberation at Leipzig.

310
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:47,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems like it's got some stuff going on.

311
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:52,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Although it seems to me most people prefer Battlefield 2 to Battlefield 2142.

312
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:01,534
[SPEAKER_12]: I played like yay much of Battlefield 2 and decided it wasn't my kind of game, but have you played a little more of this, Loki?

313
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:02,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

314
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:03,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I thought you had for some reason.

315
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:08,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I had it for free, and I don't try to play too much PC stuff.

316
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,002
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, the last PC game I played was Oblivion.

317
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:12,884
[SPEAKER_14]: I loaded it on there, and...

318
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,571
[SPEAKER_14]: My laptop barely runs it.

319
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:17,771
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't really like it too much.

320
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:22,553
[SPEAKER_14]: But I played with a lot of cheat devices running at the same time, so I have my super-powered character.

321
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:35,639
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was fun going around and killing people from long distances away, unlocking spells that were just in there for test purposes, and just plainly exerting my force over the citizens of a town.

322
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:36,519
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I like.

323
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Why aren't you playing more PC games?

324
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to play more Fable.

325
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:42,361
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not really a PC game, though.

326
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:43,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Why aren't you playing more PC games?

327
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,692
[SPEAKER_14]: because my PC's old and because also I just don't have the time for it.

328
00:25:49,332 --> 00:25:51,213
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I just don't have the time for it.

329
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:54,534
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, wife doesn't like playing games.

330
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:57,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe there'd be a PC game she likes.

331
00:25:57,655 --> 00:25:59,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Desperate Housewives of the Game came out, didn't it?

332
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:00,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Should buy that for her.

333
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:02,157
[SPEAKER_12]: See if the wife likes that.

334
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:08,000
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but that reminds me, though, I should probably load up The Sims 2 again so I can kill more Sims.

335
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and maybe get Sims 2 Pets so I can kill animals, too.

336
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:17,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, um... I wonder if you should... Too bad you can't make them drink lots of water.

337
00:26:18,468 --> 00:26:18,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop it.

338
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving back to the console world.

339
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:29,440
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, folks that have 360s that are on their last legs don't really want to have to send that back if they cannot help it.

340
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:32,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Kotaku ran an interesting story earlier this week about an old...

341
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:33,901
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

342
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:10,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead of using a heat gun, you're using the heat coming off the CPU because you're wrapping it up in the towels.

343
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:11,125
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a good idea.

344
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Just put it that way.

345
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:13,687
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a good idea to do it.

346
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:14,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

347
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:27,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Because before the thought was that they were overheating because the contact between the heat sink and the actual processor, whatever they put in there, wasn't fully melted all the way.

348
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:33,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And so using the heat gun, you would melt that so it would have a better contact with the heat sink and it would cause it to not overheat.

349
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:42,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, by wrapping this whole thing in a towel, you may be, you know, duplicating that, but at the same time, you're overheating everything else and causing stuff to break.

350
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:51,109
[SPEAKER_14]: So, in a sense, I guess, if you have the Three Rings of Death already, you might as well give it a shot because it's not going to hurt nothing, but, I mean... Not going to help it either.

351
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:52,290
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to probably help it either.

352
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, JeremyTaw1 says, on the IGM message board, someone tried the towel trick and they said it actually worked.

353
00:27:57,474 --> 00:27:59,436
[SPEAKER_12]: ActDeft says, hey, I got the Three Rings of Death.

354
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:00,677
[SPEAKER_12]: Just hit your 360.

355
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:01,317
[SPEAKER_12]: It really works.

356
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:03,279
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um...

357
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Just give your 360 a lot of water.

358
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:11,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Submerge it.

359
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:13,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Topic change, please.

360
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:15,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Submerge it into the ocean.

361
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:16,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Topic change, please.

362
00:28:17,118 --> 00:28:21,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, speaking of funny, crazy stuff, let's talk about our friend Ken Kutaragi.

363
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:23,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Crayon Man!

364
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,964
[SPEAKER_14]: In 2006, he had a lot of crazy things to say.

365
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:29,747
[SPEAKER_14]: All the more reason, I think, that, you know, we should really get him to stop talking.

366
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:30,047
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

367
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:37,346
[SPEAKER_14]: There is actually a website that compiled a pretty interesting list of his quotes, PS3 Today.

368
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:43,612
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we thought we would share some of them with you and maybe have some discussion about how crazy he is.

369
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:47,736
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, the PlayStation 3 is not a game machine.

370
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:49,318
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a quote from him.

371
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,800
[SPEAKER_14]: So, not a game machine.

372
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,102
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's a computer.

373
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways...

374
00:28:55,419 --> 00:29:04,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Being us for a short moment is like accidentally winning a point from a sheer hand, Karate Master, and Microsoft is still not a black belt.

375
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:12,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like with their operating systems, they might come out with something good around the third generation of their release.

376
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:14,367
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't get that.

377
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:15,228
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't make any sense.

378
00:29:17,229 --> 00:29:17,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

379
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:18,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this one's kind of funny.

380
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft shoots for the moon.

381
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you just say Microsoft?

382
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:26,542
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all having talking problems.

383
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:27,643
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I can't even talk.

384
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:30,145
[SPEAKER_12]: We're all having talking problems.

385
00:29:30,245 --> 00:29:31,526
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in the water in this town.

386
00:29:31,846 --> 00:29:35,609
[SPEAKER_12]: The water not only is killing people, but it's making people stupid.

387
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:39,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, Microsoft shoots for the moon, Sony shoots for the sun.

388
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:42,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

389
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:48,478
[SPEAKER_14]: It says, this time Microsoft has stated clearly that it's going after the PlayStation.

390
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:52,953
[SPEAKER_14]: However, they're going after the, not after the PlayStation 3, but the PlayStation 2.

391
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:57,876
[SPEAKER_14]: They were looking at 2, and that's why Xbox 360 became like that.

392
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:03,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's like, because it's the second console from them, they're going after the second console from Sony?

393
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense either.

394
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:15,186
[SPEAKER_14]: With PlayStation, or the PlayStation 3, our intentions have been to create a machine with supercomputer calculation capabilities for home entertainment.

395
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:17,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

396
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:18,208
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

397
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,821
[SPEAKER_14]: PlayStation 3 will instill discipline in our children and adults alike.

398
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:24,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone will know discipline.

399
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:48,755
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura's website of the week.

400
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:51,696
[SPEAKER_12]: She serves the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and...

401
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:14,934
[SPEAKER_12]: All over the place.

402
00:31:14,994 --> 00:31:20,359
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I hear there's 13 different ways she can hold her internet, including the mortar and pestle.

403
00:31:20,899 --> 00:31:26,104
[SPEAKER_12]: And she finds a website that she likes and shares it all with you here on our program.

404
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:27,545
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

405
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:31,648
[SPEAKER_12]: See?

406
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:32,769
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something in the water.

407
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't drink the water, though.

408
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:35,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I had coffee.

409
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:37,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Coffee is made of water, stupid.

410
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:39,155
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't use tap water, though.

411
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:41,273
[SPEAKER_07]: I used filtered water.

412
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:43,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I filter all the stupid out of it.

413
00:31:43,414 --> 00:31:43,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

414
00:31:44,114 --> 00:31:49,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, the website of the week is YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com Best site ever.

415
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:54,741
[SPEAKER_07]: This site actually has downloadable stickers.

416
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:55,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Or not stickers, but...

417
00:31:57,219 --> 00:32:03,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Notices that you can leave on people's cars, like in Fraction 1 and Fraction 2.

418
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,682
[SPEAKER_07]: They're available in a PDF format.

419
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:08,563
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can leave them on cars that you see parked badly.

420
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:14,465
[SPEAKER_07]: As in double parking, being too close to the line to where no one can get out of the car next to them.

421
00:32:15,705 --> 00:32:26,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And the best thing about that is that it has check marks that you can put on there to say, like, listed two spots, one car, a little too close, too far away from the driveway.

422
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:37,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Too close to my driveway, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car, move up, that's a compact, and others so that you can walk it in.

423
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:44,292
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a disclaimer that says, parking is far too limited in our overcrowded streets and parking lots, and you happen to park like an asshole.

424
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the above website to see why someone else thought you parked like an asshole.

425
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be too offended, we all do it at one time or another, it just so happens that you got caught.

426
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, Jamie, I'll give you a quarter to leave one on extra first car.

427
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:58,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I'd do it for free.

428
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:00,795
[SPEAKER_14]: What was I going to say?

429
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also send pictures to the site, too.

430
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:05,100
[SPEAKER_14]: They need the one that's like four corners.

431
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,406
[SPEAKER_14]: It's where you park in four spaces at once, you know, like just down the center of the crossing.

432
00:33:10,746 --> 00:33:11,487
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go to the site.

433
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:14,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, I have a little printer right here, a little cheap-ass $30 printer.

434
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go to the site.

435
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:21,284
[SPEAKER_12]: First thing, when I can, when this show's done, I'm going to print some out and carry them around in my car, and I'll let you know how many I use.

436
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:27,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, yesterday, when I was getting sushi, there were these people who were just parked... I mean, really freaking parked badly.

437
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, the line was in the middle of both of their cars, yeah?

438
00:33:30,446 --> 00:33:33,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, how about they need one on there that says, this is not a parking spot, you know?

439
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:37,967
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, like, in the middle of the road, or, like, double parked, or just wherever.

440
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:40,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, also, you can...

441
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:41,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is what I did.

442
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:45,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually just hand wrote notes and left diagrams pointing the proper way to park.

443
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:47,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first one says, you park like an idiot.

444
00:33:47,603 --> 00:33:49,324
[SPEAKER_07]: You learn how to do this when you're a teenager.

445
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:50,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do it again.

446
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,046
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other one was, you park like you're retarded.

447
00:33:52,086 --> 00:33:52,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Get back on the short bus.

448
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:58,671
[SPEAKER_12]: What if the person really was mentally challenged?

449
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:00,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they don't need to be driving.

450
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,255
[SPEAKER_07]: But this person was triple parked.

451
00:34:03,355 --> 00:34:04,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I kid you not.

452
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:06,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even for legitimate reasons.

453
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:07,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It was at a restaurant.

454
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:10,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Real quick here, I got one more Ken Kutaragi quote.

455
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:11,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I missed this one.

456
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:20,948
[SPEAKER_14]: It says, if processors of high performance and wide bandwidth like the cell were linked together without sufficient security, a worldwide system crash could occur with one attack.

457
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a site called YouTalkLikeAnAsshole.com?

458
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

459
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of assholes, here's one in training.

460
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently a nine-year-old child stole their neighbor's car.

461
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,085
[SPEAKER_12]: got spotted by police on the interstate, guns it to a 90-mile-an-hour chase.

462
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:48,391
[SPEAKER_12]: The kid tried to take an exit ramp, but the engine blew and the car hit a curb, went into a tree, and the kid gets captured.

463
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:51,194
[SPEAKER_12]: How the hell did a 9-year-old learn to drive a car?

464
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:58,561
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to do so many loops in the parking lot at my high school with the driver's ed instructor before I was ever able to figure out how to drive.

465
00:34:58,741 --> 00:34:59,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Same way I did.

466
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:00,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Ridge Racer!

467
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:13,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, you're not helping much because apparently, according to what was going on, is that the mom believed that PlayStation taught him how to do all this.

468
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,625
[SPEAKER_12]: So apparently either Grand Theft Auto or Ridge Racer, this is where he learned to drive and do all this and hightail it to get away from the cops.

469
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:21,226
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not helping, DarkSakura.

470
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:22,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, did you see the other part of this?

471
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:24,329
[SPEAKER_07]: But they don't have accurate driving simulators.

472
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:25,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was arcade games that did it.

473
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,211
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all Gran Turismo's fault.

474
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:30,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see the real driving simulator?

475
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:39,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, did you see the rest of the story where they were talking about how he, before that, also recently evaded airport security, managing the hop-up flight?

476
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:42,083
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they're trying to turn it into Chuck Norris.

477
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:42,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.

478
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:43,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that'd be funny, Chris.

479
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:52,071
[SPEAKER_14]: See, that'd be cool if he actually did that, because, you know, I'd give props to the kid, but, um... Yeah, I think, though, seriously... Props to the kid?

480
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,132
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my tax dollars paying to bust his ass.

481
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:55,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck that.

482
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:56,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Put him in juvie.

483
00:35:57,273 --> 00:36:03,014
[SPEAKER_14]: No, props to the kid, because the parents should get, you know, fucking billed or something for this shit.

484
00:36:03,134 --> 00:36:05,894
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely agree the parents should be billed for it all.

485
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,535
[SPEAKER_12]: My tax dollars should not go to pay for this stupid kid.

486
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:12,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't let little Billy in the goddamn car.

487
00:36:12,651 --> 00:36:13,792
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a gateway to porn.

488
00:36:14,092 --> 00:36:15,814
[SPEAKER_12]: He can drive to a porno show.

489
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Where did he learn to steal a car?

490
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:20,999
[SPEAKER_12]: In a video game, you press X to steal the car.

491
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,462
[SPEAKER_12]: You did not go through the whole process.

492
00:36:23,522 --> 00:36:24,442
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't steal a car.

493
00:36:24,543 --> 00:36:25,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's what happened.

494
00:36:25,504 --> 00:36:27,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Little fucking mommy went into the store.

495
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Billy, stay in the car.

496
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:30,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to leave it running.

497
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Got in the driver's seat and drove off.

498
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,931
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what happened.

499
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:34,072
[SPEAKER_12]: It said it was the neighbor's car.

500
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:36,940
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

501
00:36:58,194 --> 00:37:01,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently there's been some screenshots where pedestrians have been spotted.

502
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:06,518
[SPEAKER_14]: I can only hope that that were the case, but unfortunately I'm thinking this is from some sort of cutscene in the game.

503
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:13,601
[SPEAKER_14]: But if there's pedestrians and I can hit them going 200 miles an hour, that sold the game twice to me right there.

504
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:14,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously.

505
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.

506
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:22,044
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, seriously, if there's actually pedestrians on the road that run away from your car and stuff, oh my god, did I just buy this game like three times.

507
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:23,585
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all, because...

508
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:26,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Burnout is so hot to begin with.

509
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:27,446
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of my favorite racers.

510
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:28,366
[SPEAKER_12]: It really is awesome.

511
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:29,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Except for the soundtracks.

512
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:30,888
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I love 360.

513
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:32,969
[SPEAKER_12]: You can just change out the soundtrack.

514
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:34,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, man.

515
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:40,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I want an adult-only game where I can blow these people.

516
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:44,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see blood splatters and skull fragments shattering into my window.

517
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:46,882
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be awesome.

518
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:57,268
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, seriously, I think if, you know, especially with Rockstar and the next Grand Theft Auto game, hell, just go adult only and just fucking go crazy.

519
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Go fucking nuts.

520
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Just have a normal, like, do like movies.

521
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:03,872
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, have a rated version of the game and have the underrated.

522
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:15,480
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that way you can still sell as many copies and, you know, some people will buy the underrated where you can fucking blow people up and have skull fragments, you know, slam into your car.

523
00:38:16,178 --> 00:38:21,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be cool, though, if the skull fragments could impale other people and embed in their skulls and kill them.

524
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:22,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

525
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:24,122
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be fantastic.

526
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:25,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

527
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:26,704
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are morbid.

528
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:27,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not!

529
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,987
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to read some chat comments right now, but I just totally got booted from chat.

530
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:34,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I pinged out, so... I'll read chat comments!

531
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:35,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, is there anything interesting?

532
00:38:36,029 --> 00:38:37,449
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is awesome.

533
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Real ones, please.

534
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:43,933
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just saying a yay burnout.

535
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,224
[SPEAKER_07]: and Red Asphalt, someone said.

536
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:49,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Ouch.

537
00:38:51,666 --> 00:39:07,354
[SPEAKER_07]: But moving on to the next story, speaking of fun violence, we have Calling All Cars, formerly known as Criminal Crackdown, which is supposed to be a mix of stuff like Bomberman and Twisted Metal and Demolition Derby.

538
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: with explosions and crashes and criminals and crashes and more crashes and more crashes.

539
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,340
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of looks like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.

540
00:39:14,621 --> 00:39:14,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

541
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:18,524
[SPEAKER_07]: It has that same sort of... Well, it's more of a diagonally overhead view, I think.

542
00:39:19,905 --> 00:39:26,330
[SPEAKER_07]: But Sony Computer Entertainment is saying that it would be out by March.

543
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,773
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's hope so.

544
00:39:29,913 --> 00:39:31,014
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks kind of fun to me.

545
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:33,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I love exploding stuff.

546
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:36,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the description here.

547
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:40,971
[SPEAKER_07]: It says Tom and Jerry type violence with mass destruction.

548
00:39:44,153 --> 00:39:44,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

549
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds interesting.

550
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:47,374
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

551
00:39:47,714 --> 00:39:53,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're going to take your calls pretty soon on our Skype line, which is 1-877-GAME-OLR, or the username is Skype.

552
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:58,238
[SPEAKER_12]: But one other thing that that phone line can be used for is to leave voicemails when we're not here.

553
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:03,200
[SPEAKER_12]: And we like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when you...

554
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:14,340
[SPEAKER_12]: We like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when we're not able to take your calls live.

555
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,321
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to play some of those voicemails right now.

556
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:18,602
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got some really good ones from the last couple shows.

557
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:20,463
[SPEAKER_12]: So here's our first voicemail.

558
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:21,423
[SPEAKER_12]: This one's about two minutes.

559
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Razorburn2021.

560
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:26,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to make some comments on last week's show.

561
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:28,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got done with my weekly listen and...

562
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:38,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Paradox Vincent's call about Wii Sports kind of got me thinking about a problem I've been having for the last couple of gens with Nintendo product.

563
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:46,109
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the things that's kind of held me back from really getting into, and it's kind of a Nintendo fanaticism.

564
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:53,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys like Paradox Vincent, you know, if you can't look at a game like Wii Sports, I mean, like,

565
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:55,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm huge.

566
00:40:55,783 --> 00:41:00,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I've really, really enjoyed Gears of War, but I can look at it and see why there are people that won't like it.

567
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:05,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see why people would see it's boring or that it just doesn't have the flair they're looking for.

568
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:14,570
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't look at Wii Sports and see why a critic would bash it, I think you've really kind of let yourself get a little too into Nintendo.

569
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:20,292
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this feeling out there that Nintendo can do no wrong, and I think Graybush, when you had your interview, touched on a little bit that

570
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:34,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Most systems have fans that are way, way, way harder on their games than Nintendo because I think right now Wii fanatics are kind of really thirsty for every game to be, specifically the Nintendo titles, to be a huge success.

571
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:42,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard stories from most podcasts I listen to about, well, over the holidays I took it and my grandma wanted to play Wii Sports.

572
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:47,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard that a lot, but how many of your grandmas really are going out and buying a Wii?

573
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:51,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you say, well, Grandma came over and she wanted to talk to me about Wii Bowling.

574
00:41:51,236 --> 00:41:58,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, how many grandmas are sitting around the hair parlor and saying, well, Edith, last week I played Wii Bowling.

575
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:01,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaming has come a long way, but I don't think it's come a long way.

576
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, your grandpa will play Wii Sports with you, but I don't think, you know, he was a nom.

577
00:42:06,682 --> 00:42:08,162
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not going to sit down and play Elements.

578
00:42:08,722 --> 00:42:13,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that what you need to be able to see both sides of an argument to really be a gamer.

579
00:42:14,384 --> 00:42:15,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if you're really looking at

580
00:42:16,624 --> 00:42:19,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm being kind of rambly now, and now my call's gone too long, so I'm just going to let you go.

581
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:20,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you.

582
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:42,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you very much for the voicemail.

583
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:44,029
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate it.

584
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:45,751
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's kind of interesting.

585
00:42:47,392 --> 00:42:51,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of trying to think back to the show when that was taped and kind of everything that we said that was going on there.

586
00:42:51,756 --> 00:42:56,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I think, you know, I don't think it's necessarily that Nintendo can do no wrong.

587
00:42:56,581 --> 00:43:00,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Because certainly, you know, at least us here in studio pointed out many faults that Nintendo's done.

588
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:03,006
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, we were just making fun of Red Steel earlier.

589
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:04,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, granted, that's a third-party title.

590
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,449
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, most people would say, hey, it's a mistake.

591
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo's not online right now.

592
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:08,951
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

593
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:31,702
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

594
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:45,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey guys, this is Mr. Wonderful from the forums.

595
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:16,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to chime in with what Sky was saying on the most recent show about gaming journalism being in for a rude awakening.

596
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:17,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't agree more.

597
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:30,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a gaming journalist myself, and for too long the gaming journalism community has really just been focusing on what they perceive to be hardcore and trying to tell the community about what's new and hardcore and underground, but they're a mainstream publication.

598
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to appeal to all walks of life.

599
00:44:33,021 --> 00:44:35,904
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to appeal to the gaming public as a whole, not just niches.

600
00:44:36,604 --> 00:44:39,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the Wii is going to provide a huge awakening.

601
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:42,369
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to provide a revolution, if you will, of this community.

602
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:50,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Because journalists can't just say, you know, Gears of War is the greatest game ever because, you know, Cliffy B made it and all this.

603
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:55,239
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of new gamers out there who don't know who Cliffy B is and probably don't care.

604
00:44:55,699 --> 00:45:02,085
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to start covering a wider range of topics and they're going to have to start backing up claims.

605
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:03,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see a new...

606
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,540
[SPEAKER_02]: A new age of gaming magazines.

607
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,301
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't just keep continuing on the path they're on.

608
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:14,304
[SPEAKER_02]: This huge audience that Nintendo's got is not going to be buying their magazines if they don't understand a damn word of them.

609
00:45:15,064 --> 00:45:19,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I agree pretty much wholeheartedly with what you're saying.

610
00:45:19,546 --> 00:45:23,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be an interesting time for journalism as well as gaming, and I can't wait to see where it goes.

611
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:28,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But if somebody doesn't pick up on this trend that there's non-gamers that are gaming now,

612
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:53,126
[SPEAKER_02]: then I don't think they're going to get into it whereas if there is a magazine out there that caters to this idea that people who haven't played games and don't know as much about the history or the culture of gaming and you know, kind of a my first gaming magazine if you will I think something like that could have huge success so I'd really like to see something like that happen great show and keep up the great work looking forward to the next one take it easy guys

613
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for the voicemail, we appreciate it

614
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:34,812
[SPEAKER_12]: because people usually buy magazines for their hobbies and the things they're really into so I don't know if necessarily a casual gaming magazine would sell but I kind of go back to something I had referenced on a particular show where I said magazines like Entertainment Weekly and so on need to expand on their gaming sections and magazines that are dedicated to entertainment and those types of things in general should look at these things from a casual game perspective.

615
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:37,374
[SPEAKER_12]: That was my thought.

616
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:39,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else you guys want to add?

617
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:45,378
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Morpheus in chat says, why doesn't OLR play hate voicemails?

618
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:46,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Because everyone loves us.

619
00:46:46,399 --> 00:46:47,460
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't get hate voicemails.

620
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:47,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Start sending them in.

621
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, call and leave us some.

622
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:49,301
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

623
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:49,761
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we're not going to

624
00:47:09,081 --> 00:47:11,324
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd listen to them and get a chuckle out of it and then we'd delete it.

625
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:12,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

626
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:15,390
[SPEAKER_12]: James Patrick has a good comment.

627
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:17,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Saying Nintendo fans are crazy is stupid.

628
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:18,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Madden fans.

629
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:19,817
[SPEAKER_12]: GTA fans.

630
00:47:19,897 --> 00:47:21,139
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of fans are just as bad.

631
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:22,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

632
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:23,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

633
00:47:25,455 --> 00:47:27,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, oh, this is interesting.

634
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:29,058
[SPEAKER_12]: SSJ100Matt has an interesting comment.

635
00:47:29,398 --> 00:47:32,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Some Nintendo fanboys are getting as bad as Scientologists.

636
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,024
[SPEAKER_12]: When someone says something bad about it, they go on the offensive, like the Zelda 8.8 rating.

637
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:39,505
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree, people got their panties way too ruffled over that one.

638
00:47:39,545 --> 00:47:49,153
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, people in general should just realize it's just some dude's opinion who happens to work for a big website that all you people visit.

639
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:55,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why, but you do, and you apparently listen to what they have to say, but in the end, it's just one dude's opinion.

640
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:56,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?

641
00:47:57,692 --> 00:47:59,553
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how you look around.

642
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:03,916
[SPEAKER_12]: What makes these people any more qualified than you, you, or me?

643
00:48:04,696 --> 00:48:04,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh?

644
00:48:05,577 --> 00:48:10,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I realize they went to journalism school, they know how to write, and they have a love of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff.

645
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

646
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:13,402
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I have a love of games.

647
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:17,284
[SPEAKER_12]: You that listened and downloaded this video game podcast has a love of games.

648
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:22,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so these guys know their spelling and their grammar and how to write a good review.

649
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:23,328
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about it.

650
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:30,670
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't always mean... I mean, I don't think, to be honest, a lot of these people have gone to journalism school.

651
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:37,793
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they're just being hired, so... I could almost... In fact, I know for a fact not all of them have.

652
00:48:38,274 --> 00:48:39,214
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that for a fact.

653
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:41,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well.

654
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:43,096
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what we got.

655
00:48:43,997 --> 00:48:44,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Any more news?

656
00:48:46,398 --> 00:48:47,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we definitely have some new stuff.

657
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,661
[SPEAKER_14]: So, this was pretty exciting.

658
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:53,222
[SPEAKER_14]: All week long, they've been kind of...

659
00:48:53,814 --> 00:48:54,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Ghostbusters Zootfly

660
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:47,312
[SPEAKER_14]: and right now on top of the Ghostbusters game Zoop Fly is also working on another game called Time Zero and it's basically it's kind of related to Ghostbusters a little bit talks about two adventurers who are diehard New Yorkers and they get trapped in a deep like the shadow world of a parallel New York and the city itself is actually a war machine threatening to wipe out the world and they have three days to stop it so

661
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:48,835
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of neat.

662
00:49:48,915 --> 00:49:49,555
[SPEAKER_14]: They're working on that.

663
00:49:49,575 --> 00:49:56,857
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know they're also working on another game called Toy Wars, which is coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, which looks pretty cool, too.

664
00:49:57,117 --> 00:50:03,419
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully people, you know, so far the response has been pretty good on it.

665
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:06,259
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of fans want to see this thing made.

666
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:10,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So hopefully a publisher jumps on this and gets a license he writes paid for.

667
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,781
[SPEAKER_14]: And hopefully we see this game come to fruition.

668
00:50:16,702 --> 00:50:16,982
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

669
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:24,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that sounds pretty cool, and I like that screenshot of the toy game that you showed me, and that's kind of cool.

670
00:50:24,213 --> 00:50:24,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

671
00:50:24,374 --> 00:50:25,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this something you'll probably buy?

672
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:26,596
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be.

673
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:28,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Ghostbusters.

674
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:29,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it'd be fun.

675
00:50:29,478 --> 00:50:30,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Will it have the song in it?

676
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:31,299
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I want to know.

677
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, the song is different.

678
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:38,245
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a rock version of it in the video that they were showing, so I liked it.

679
00:50:38,305 --> 00:50:39,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was pretty cool.

680
00:50:39,486 --> 00:50:40,207
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, very cool.

681
00:50:41,178 --> 00:50:44,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, this is the point of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line.

682
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:53,465
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to give us a call, our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, or you can give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the US and Canada.

683
00:50:53,925 --> 00:51:05,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, UK folks and those in other countries, whether it be Australia, wherever you're at, you'll have to use the old-fashioned method of calling us on Skype, which I guess isn't really old-fashioned, but for us it is.

684
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:06,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phones.

685
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:08,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting a lot of calls tonight already.

686
00:51:09,575 --> 00:51:10,517
[SPEAKER_12]: We are the gateway to porn

687
00:51:24,028 --> 00:51:29,972
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I just want to say, before we start getting into this, I want to say, Rob D's quality is like perfect right now.

688
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:32,973
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm loving this call because I don't hear myself echoing in the background.

689
00:51:33,094 --> 00:51:33,614
[SPEAKER_05]: No static.

690
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:35,135
[SPEAKER_12]: No static.

691
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,235
[SPEAKER_12]: His volume is perfect.

692
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:38,697
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a model phone call, boys and girls.

693
00:51:38,757 --> 00:51:39,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I applaud you.

694
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,198
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a good enunciation.

695
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:41,539
[SPEAKER_12]: I do.

696
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,842
[SPEAKER_12]: I applaud you, Rob D. Not to knock on the other callers because I realize it's internet radio and what have you.

697
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:51,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob D, whatever you've done to set yourself up, you need to share that with everybody.

698
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:52,109
[SPEAKER_12]: It's great.

699
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds great.

700
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:55,611
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so the Wii porn story, what do you want to say?

701
00:51:56,712 --> 00:52:00,194
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so basically, I don't know if you actually covered this.

702
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:05,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I unfortunately was watching part of the Colts game, so I was kind of halfway listening to OLR.

703
00:52:06,137 --> 00:52:06,677
[SPEAKER_08]: We forgive you.

704
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:07,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

705
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:14,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I don't know if you covered this, but did you read the quote from A Supposed Child where he said,

706
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:18,467
[SPEAKER_08]: The first thing I did when I got the Wii was think about porn or something like that.

707
00:52:18,547 --> 00:52:21,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, something that the website had got from their blog.

708
00:52:21,629 --> 00:52:26,673
[SPEAKER_12]: They went and looked at a blog and said, hey, one child said on their blog that the first thing I thought about when I got the Wii was porn.

709
00:52:27,693 --> 00:52:29,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the Wii, no, it was the Wii browser.

710
00:52:29,094 --> 00:52:31,055
[SPEAKER_12]: First thing I thought about when the Wii browser was porn.

711
00:52:32,096 --> 00:52:33,217
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was curious about that.

712
00:52:33,297 --> 00:52:37,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Since it mentioned that it was a blog, I plugged the quote into Google just to see where it was from.

713
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, good thinking, my friend.

714
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:40,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Where did it come from?

715
00:52:41,782 --> 00:52:43,283
[SPEAKER_08]: It's from a post on Haku.

716
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:44,064
[SPEAKER_08]: On where?

717
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:44,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Haku.

718
00:52:44,656 --> 00:52:45,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Kotaku.

719
00:52:45,516 --> 00:52:45,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

720
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:47,978
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a comment to some random article.

721
00:52:48,018 --> 00:52:48,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget what it was.

722
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:50,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought you were going to say MySpace.

723
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:58,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, okay, that's interesting because then how would they know that it was a child?

724
00:52:58,263 --> 00:53:01,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Kotaku's commenting system doesn't tell a person their age, right?

725
00:53:02,206 --> 00:53:04,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's what's actually funny about this.

726
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:11,190
[SPEAKER_08]: The comment immediately preceding that quote was, as a male aged 18 to 35.

727
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:14,032
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kid you not, that's exactly what it was.

728
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:15,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

729
00:53:17,378 --> 00:53:19,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And he is quoted as a child in that article.

730
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:20,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

731
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:22,922
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're totally stretching the facts and stuff.

732
00:53:23,123 --> 00:53:23,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Not surprising.

733
00:53:23,643 --> 00:53:29,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll find the quote on Google, or I'll find the webpage and shove it in chat just to verify that.

734
00:53:29,808 --> 00:53:31,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not pulling this out of nowhere.

735
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:31,810
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I believe you.

736
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pulling the gross horse in there.

737
00:53:32,891 --> 00:53:34,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the power of Google is an amazing thing.

738
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:37,435
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's kind of funny.

739
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:39,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought that how, that the fact that they...

740
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,041
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

741
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:52,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and this is almost as good as that one article a year ago about how the PSP pulls porn out of thin air.

742
00:53:53,165 --> 00:53:57,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, some folks in chat don't know what Kotaku is, so we should say it's a big gaming blog.

743
00:53:57,607 --> 00:54:03,549
[SPEAKER_12]: If you know Destructoid or even like IGN and GameSpot's news feed, it's very similar.

744
00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:04,930
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a game blog.

745
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,691
[SPEAKER_12]: You can put an RSS in your reader and get all their news and stuff.

746
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:08,951
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what Kotaku is.

747
00:54:09,532 --> 00:54:11,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm sorry, what was the other thing you were saying?

748
00:54:12,213 --> 00:54:17,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying it's almost as good as the article from about a year ago when it said that the PSP was...

749
00:54:18,496 --> 00:54:20,737
[SPEAKER_08]: or no, if the PSP pulled porn out of thin air.

750
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:23,437
[SPEAKER_12]: It just made up porn.

751
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:24,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

752
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:29,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, dude, if the PS3 would pull porn out of thin air, I'd buy it.

753
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:30,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Only no Blu-ray doesn't.

754
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:33,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, now we do.

755
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:42,042
[SPEAKER_12]: It actually reminds me of the story where we had the DS, and remember the one TV news station did a story about child predators on the DS in PictoChat?

756
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:45,935
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it reminds me of.

757
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:47,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Too many penis drawings?

758
00:54:47,736 --> 00:54:54,980
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the fact that, oh my gosh, your four-year-old might be playing on the Nintendo DS and a child predator could write something sexual on it.

759
00:54:55,581 --> 00:55:00,904
[SPEAKER_12]: But what people forget is that if somebody's doing that, that person is in the room with you.

760
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:04,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Those DSs do not have that huge a range.

761
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:06,047
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

762
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:08,517
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, anyway, that's all I have to say.

763
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:10,018
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what was going on at E3 a couple years ago.

764
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:10,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's different.

765
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:11,539
[SPEAKER_12]: That's E3.

766
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,861
[SPEAKER_12]: You put all the nerds in a room and that's what's going to happen.

767
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:15,562
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, Rob D., we appreciate the call.

768
00:55:15,582 --> 00:55:16,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I tossed a link in chat, by the way.

769
00:55:16,943 --> 00:55:17,024
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

770
00:55:17,044 --> 00:55:17,304
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

771
00:55:17,724 --> 00:55:18,665
[SPEAKER_12]: I tossed a link in chat.

772
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:19,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, great.

773
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:19,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

774
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:20,887
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take a look at that.

775
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:22,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, thanks for taking my call.

776
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:23,468
[SPEAKER_12]: See you guys later.

777
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:24,049
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

778
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:24,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, buddy.

779
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:25,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for the call.

780
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:27,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Model OLR phone call.

781
00:55:27,732 --> 00:55:32,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it looks like, of course, since I said that, he did cut out a couple times during the call, but that's just probably our connection.

782
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:36,679
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all the people playing fucking World of Warcraft in the other room that's causing that.

783
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:37,059
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's...

784
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:37,969
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what's up.

785
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to another call.

786
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

787
00:55:41,651 --> 00:55:42,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

788
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:46,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everyone's favorite caller, Raven's Dolphin.

789
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:47,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Raven's Dolphin.

790
00:55:47,874 --> 00:55:50,575
[SPEAKER_12]: What can we do for you this week, buddy?

791
00:55:52,236 --> 00:55:53,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely nothing.

792
00:55:53,256 --> 00:55:57,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to comment on the Wii thing and the PSP thing.

793
00:55:58,679 --> 00:55:59,799
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have to say this first.

794
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,001
[SPEAKER_12]: You're becoming quite the famous little caller of Internet radio programs, I'm noticing.

795
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:07,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I figured that.

796
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,773
[SPEAKER_12]: You should start your own show.

797
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:16,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Not that I'm discouraging you from calling into programs, but it's obvious you have a lot to say.

798
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:22,041
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we haven't proven this fact, any schmo with a microphone can do a show.

799
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:23,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You should think about it.

800
00:56:25,692 --> 00:56:26,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about it.

801
00:56:26,672 --> 00:56:28,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely thinking about it.

802
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:32,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the thing about is money, and can I keep it going for an hour?

803
00:56:33,114 --> 00:56:33,614
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

804
00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:37,714
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Morpheus says, how about a show of clips of him just calling into other shows?

805
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:38,575
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a brilliant idea.

806
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:40,315
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

807
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:41,715
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just fucking with you, Raven's Dolphin.

808
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:42,515
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind, really?

809
00:56:42,555 --> 00:56:42,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

810
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say that I watched that clip with the Wii, you know, when they talk about the Wii for porn.

811
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:56,040
[SPEAKER_03]: The two little girls that had the Wii, they took them and I pushed pause and they didn't even have the internet browser.

812
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they even have internet at all.

813
00:56:58,661 --> 00:57:05,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, so like you watched the clip, like on the TV site you watched a clip of the girls playing with the Wii and they didn't even have the internet channel on it.

814
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:08,663
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even have it on.

815
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:12,203
[SPEAKER_03]: They went to the news show, like, look, it's a game with the porn.

816
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think they even have internet.

817
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:18,882
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have to download it off the Wii, but you have to download it off the Wii Channel.

818
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,804
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many different things you have to do.

819
00:57:20,824 --> 00:57:22,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think people realize that.

820
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:27,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Your quality is kind of screwing up there, buddy, but yeah, you know what?

821
00:57:27,389 --> 00:57:28,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn the media for doing that.

822
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:30,472
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just looking for something.

823
00:57:30,832 --> 00:57:32,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just feel like TV's just failing me now.

824
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:06,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, you always, you have to take some of the things that you hear on the news with a grain of salt, unfortunately, especially these types of investigation stories.

825
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:14,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's one thing to report on a fire that's, you know, engulfed an entire neighborhood or whatever, and it's another thing to report on these types of moral issues, right?

826
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:17,202
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

827
00:58:17,442 --> 00:58:20,384
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping to get a live 365 stream soon.

828
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:21,604
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of money.

829
00:58:22,004 --> 00:58:22,285
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

830
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:26,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, good luck to you, Raven Stolfen, and you know, if you get your own show, we got your back.

831
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:28,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

832
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:30,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I have your back too.

833
00:58:30,829 --> 00:58:31,109
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

834
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:31,449
[SPEAKER_12]: We know.

835
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:32,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, buddy.

836
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:33,990
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

837
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

838
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:34,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

839
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:35,811
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

840
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:37,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, let's, oops, did I just hang up on someone else?

841
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:38,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let's go.

842
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:41,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Our phone lines are open.

843
00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:44,414
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

844
00:58:44,474 --> 00:58:45,754
[SPEAKER_12]: You can always call us on Skype.

845
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:48,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.

846
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:50,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody have any last minute stories real quick?

847
00:58:50,756 --> 00:58:52,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, interject here in between some calls.

848
00:58:52,857 --> 00:58:53,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

849
00:58:53,457 --> 00:58:55,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, just a couple things real quick.

850
00:58:55,778 --> 00:58:55,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

851
00:58:56,676 --> 00:59:24,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Mega Man Star Force is actually getting a pretty cool peripheral for the DS and it's actually some sort of almost like the card scanning system that they had for Animal Crossing and some other stuff before so you can actually plug that in and scan your Mega Man cards to be able to play in the role playing game as well so that's kind of neat and then Eidos has a

852
00:59:26,135 --> 00:59:30,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Grab the rights for Daffy Duck and The O.C.

853
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:32,717
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to see some crappy games based on that.

854
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:33,678
[SPEAKER_12]: The O.C.?

855
00:59:33,718 --> 00:59:34,218
[SPEAKER_12]: But The O.C.

856
00:59:34,258 --> 00:59:34,858
[SPEAKER_12]: canceled.

857
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:35,458
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't get it.

858
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:37,939
[SPEAKER_14]: All the perfect time to make a game.

859
00:59:37,959 --> 00:59:39,280
[SPEAKER_12]: We're getting another call real quick.

860
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:39,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to this one.

861
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:41,020
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a conference.

862
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a little worried about this one, but I guess we'll pick this up anyway.

863
00:59:45,142 --> 00:59:48,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm speaking to two people?

864
00:59:49,243 --> 00:59:50,424
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't know what you're talking about.

865
00:59:50,464 --> 00:59:51,744
[SPEAKER_10]: My Skype's being glitchy.

866
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, well, what's up, DMN?

867
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:54,425
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

868
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:55,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

869
00:59:56,139 --> 00:59:57,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm calling to defend WarioWare.

870
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, oh yes, because, well, I didn't give it a negative review.

871
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,482
[SPEAKER_12]: I said it's fun, but it just, you know, like most WarioWares, I don't see the magic lasting.

872
01:00:05,842 --> 01:00:07,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like most WarioWares.

873
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:08,662
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go, Rob.

874
01:00:09,362 --> 01:00:10,343
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same thing.

875
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:21,005
[SPEAKER_10]: We all, I think everybody, everybody in your chatroom, everybody who listens to your show, and even including myself, I knew that this game was going to have a lot of shit, but it was going to be three hours long of gameplay.

876
01:00:22,466 --> 01:00:23,486
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's a great party game.

877
01:00:24,835 --> 01:00:26,875
[SPEAKER_10]: It is, and I don't disagree with you there.

878
01:00:27,176 --> 01:00:28,276
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you want to defend?

879
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:30,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Where am I wrong in my assessment of WarioWare?

880
01:00:33,177 --> 01:00:34,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because you're stupid, no.

881
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:37,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to agree with that, too.

882
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:39,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I knew it.

883
01:00:40,038 --> 01:00:41,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew there was two people on the line.

884
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:42,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma, you're there, too?

885
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:45,640
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, wait, wait, wait.

886
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:52,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, never mind the fact there's two people on the line right now, whatever, but what's this whole defending WarioWare thing?

887
01:00:53,913 --> 01:00:55,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't tell you why.

888
01:00:56,734 --> 01:00:57,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

889
01:00:58,194 --> 01:00:59,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma, you care to chime in on this whole thing?

890
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,796
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because I haven't played WarioWare yet, but I can say this because of you guys.

891
01:01:04,836 --> 01:01:08,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I did buy two new games, Luminous Mobile and Cooking Mama.

892
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:11,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you hear that, Ranma, about Cooking Mama because of us?

893
01:01:12,198 --> 01:01:12,918
[SPEAKER_07]: He told me last night.

894
01:01:13,198 --> 01:01:13,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my gosh.

895
01:01:13,958 --> 01:01:17,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Luminous Mobile, you know, it's the only mobile game I think I've ever talked good about on this program.

896
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,460
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's worth it.

897
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:19,940
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good buy.

898
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:26,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm paying like $1.99 for it a month, and I'm connected to their servers, like top rankings and stuff like that.

899
01:01:26,157 --> 01:01:27,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, eh, no big deal.

900
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:39,524
[SPEAKER_10]: But another thing about WarioWare, going back to that, is this shows almost everything that the Wii can do, even more so than Wii Sports did.

901
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but I could rent it and get a lot of that.

902
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:45,467
[SPEAKER_10]: You could.

903
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:45,907
[SPEAKER_10]: You could.

904
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:53,355
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's worth a buy if you have, like me, I always have people over here.

905
01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:58,818
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you get that from OLR, but this place has become party central and it's starting to look like it too.

906
01:01:59,698 --> 01:02:00,879
[SPEAKER_12]: There's people here all the time.

907
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:04,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Thusly, WarioWare, Mario Party, those games are excellent buys for me.

908
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:10,404
[SPEAKER_12]: And for anybody with a large family or something, I just think for single player people, it's going to wear thin.

909
01:02:11,084 --> 01:02:14,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and it's a whole other show to tell you what I've seen strewn about Rob's place.

910
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:15,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, yeah.

911
01:02:16,094 --> 01:02:20,758
[SPEAKER_10]: But one thing I do want to agree with you on, I do think the $50 price tag for that game is quite steep.

912
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:32,728
[SPEAKER_10]: I think maybe if it was released at $29.99, maybe $39.99, that's kind of pushing the envelope, but I don't think $49.99 was a good idea, and I have to... I don't agree with Nintendo on that decision.

913
01:02:33,008 --> 01:02:35,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, that's what it is.

914
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:41,735
[SPEAKER_12]: So now I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do on this program, and I'm going to hang up on two people at once.

915
01:02:43,256 --> 01:02:44,017
[SPEAKER_12]: You suck!

916
01:02:44,117 --> 01:02:44,257
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

917
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:46,806
[SPEAKER_12]: That was fun.

918
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:56,211
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be Pwned with a capital P, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.

919
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:56,811
[SPEAKER_12]: One more call.

920
01:02:57,431 --> 01:02:58,612
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

921
01:02:58,652 --> 01:02:59,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

922
01:03:00,573 --> 01:03:01,533
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Legend of Zaku.

923
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:02,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

924
01:03:02,814 --> 01:03:03,494
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind, my friend?

925
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:04,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Showing me complete without a call from you.

926
01:03:04,895 --> 01:03:05,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, goddamn.

927
01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:07,556
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just wondering when you'd get through.

928
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:09,037
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first one of the year, though.

929
01:03:10,618 --> 01:03:11,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's up, Zaku?

930
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:24,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, about the whole Wii debacle about the DJs going too far, not sure, you know, basically f***ing up when they shouldn't, when they should, you know, take diligence.

931
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:25,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

932
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:32,457
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the point with, I mean, I'm not trying to belittle your call and your opinion is certainly important, but goddamn if I haven't talked about this issue until I've been blue in the face.

933
01:03:32,757 --> 01:03:34,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, Zaku, I live here.

934
01:03:34,598 --> 01:03:39,860
[SPEAKER_12]: If you think it's water cooler talk where you are, it's like ten times as much where I am, because, like, everybody thinks they knew her.

935
01:03:40,572 --> 01:03:44,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there, it's a local, one of the local things that's happening around the back of the woods.

936
01:03:45,396 --> 01:04:03,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, I could say that they're able to face involuntary manslaughter charges just for the fact that if you heard the tapes and all the recordings that were actually saved, you could see on their part that they're just shrugging off people that could have warned them.

937
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just, they show no regard.

938
01:04:06,252 --> 01:04:07,793
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that they had, like, um,

939
01:04:09,952 --> 01:04:13,013
[SPEAKER_01]: They had them sign a waiver.

940
01:04:14,273 --> 01:04:16,934
[SPEAKER_12]: I go back to what someone in chat said earlier.

941
01:04:16,974 --> 01:04:18,454
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just the DJs.

942
01:04:18,474 --> 01:04:21,275
[SPEAKER_12]: There were 10 people that went into making this contest.

943
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:24,496
[SPEAKER_12]: The DJs just egged it on, but that's their job.

944
01:04:25,216 --> 01:04:30,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the people, basically, not only the DJs, but the people involved in organizing the event.

945
01:04:30,558 --> 01:04:32,298
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll face justice eventually.

946
01:04:36,018 --> 01:04:39,379
[SPEAKER_12]: and I think in a civil trial, the entire station is going to pay for it.

947
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:46,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't doubt, I've got to be honest, Zachu, I wouldn't doubt if that station doesn't go through some radical changes.

948
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:51,503
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet you anything, and I'll keep you posted, but I'll bet you that whole station goes down over this.

949
01:04:52,603 --> 01:04:54,804
[SPEAKER_12]: They change their name or their look or something.

950
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:56,744
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to have to distance themselves from this somewhere.

951
01:04:57,084 --> 01:05:02,226
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, when it's showing up on the BBC's website that your little local radio station...

952
01:05:02,981 --> 01:05:03,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

953
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:03,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

954
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:03,521
[SPEAKER_12]: In New York.

955
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:03,921
[SPEAKER_12]: They call it Z100.

956
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:04,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Z100, essentially.

957
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:34,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, basically, I mean, when you have that, I mean, remember what happened with Opie and Anthony when they pulled that stunt a few years ago?

958
01:05:34,427 --> 01:05:38,291
[SPEAKER_01]: They got him kicked off a terrestrial radio for the first time?

959
01:05:38,551 --> 01:05:41,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but having sex in a church isn't going to kill someone.

960
01:05:42,094 --> 01:05:44,036
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually went through a lot of format shifts.

961
01:05:44,536 --> 01:05:46,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed formats throughout the years.

962
01:05:46,838 --> 01:05:52,804
[SPEAKER_01]: From the time of the incident until now, it just went through, what, a second format change?

963
01:05:53,519 --> 01:06:02,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, they tried their best to distance themselves, and what I see in the future, I hope not, but I mean... Make it quick, Zaku, they want this topic banned in chat.

964
01:06:02,944 --> 01:06:03,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Final thought.

965
01:06:06,066 --> 01:06:09,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Just reformat the station, and that's about it.

966
01:06:09,308 --> 01:06:13,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they will face justice eventually, so, you know, one of these people will end up paying.

967
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:17,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we'll keep you here posted on Orange Lounge Radio.

968
01:06:17,192 --> 01:06:20,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless this continues to have nothing to do with gaming, then we probably won't say anything at all.

969
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:21,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

970
01:06:21,555 --> 01:06:22,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, have a good one, Zaku.

971
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:23,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, see you.

972
01:06:23,642 --> 01:06:24,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

973
01:06:25,923 --> 01:06:32,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how you guys feel about this, but my personal thought is I'm willing to talk about this as long as it has to do with gaming.

974
01:06:32,629 --> 01:06:35,051
[SPEAKER_12]: If Nintendo is brought into the suit, then it has to do with gaming.

975
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:37,653
[SPEAKER_12]: But if it stays the way it is, I don't really want to talk about it anymore.

976
01:06:37,773 --> 01:06:38,273
[SPEAKER_12]: We've said enough.

977
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:39,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Nail in the coffin.

978
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:40,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

979
01:06:41,556 --> 01:06:42,076
[SPEAKER_12]: One more call.

980
01:06:42,617 --> 01:06:43,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, damn, it just went away.

981
01:06:44,178 --> 01:06:45,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they'll call back.

982
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Finish up that thought on the last minute story you had real quick.

983
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:48,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

984
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:51,604
[SPEAKER_14]: There's another one that's coming out for the Wii, another game.

985
01:06:52,062 --> 01:06:52,943
[SPEAKER_14]: That's being put out.

986
01:06:53,443 --> 01:07:03,811
[SPEAKER_14]: That's actually going to be kind of like a crazy taxi, but with emergency vehicles called Emergency Mayhem.

987
01:07:04,151 --> 01:07:06,193
[SPEAKER_14]: That's being put out by Codemasters.

988
01:07:06,433 --> 01:07:08,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Also going to be on the PS2 and the PSP.

989
01:07:09,435 --> 01:07:10,196
[SPEAKER_14]: That looks kind of fun.

990
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:12,617
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

991
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:13,398
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I got.

992
01:07:13,618 --> 01:07:14,799
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we got our caller again.

993
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:15,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phone.

994
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,840
[SPEAKER_12]: This will be the last one, I promise.

995
01:07:17,581 --> 01:07:18,682
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

996
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:19,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

997
01:07:20,523 --> 01:07:21,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Shadow Next Gen.

998
01:07:21,991 --> 01:07:23,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Shadow Next Gen, what's on your mind, my friend?

999
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:25,834
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, guys?

1000
01:07:26,554 --> 01:07:27,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, pretty good, you know.

1001
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:28,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes.

1002
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:30,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes.

1003
01:07:30,737 --> 01:07:35,580
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, since I haven't been able to call in for a while, I want to say I really enjoyed your appearance on AGI.

1004
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:36,821
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1005
01:07:37,442 --> 01:07:40,784
[SPEAKER_12]: We've actually been getting quite a few compliments on that.

1006
01:07:40,804 --> 01:07:41,505
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something else.

1007
01:07:41,645 --> 01:07:43,546
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we like working with Scott and them.

1008
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:43,906
[SPEAKER_12]: It's fun.

1009
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:49,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, although tomorrow's show should be funny if Scott shows up since his Patriot's lost.

1010
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:50,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Ha ha ha.

1011
01:07:51,127 --> 01:07:57,271
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't really follow football, but I do know he was pretty passionate about the game tonight, so that should be interesting.

1012
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,171
[SPEAKER_12]: But aren't they off all week?

1013
01:08:00,593 --> 01:08:02,574
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a show tomorrow, I believe, and then they're off.

1014
01:08:03,835 --> 01:08:04,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1015
01:08:04,635 --> 01:08:04,855
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1016
01:08:05,156 --> 01:08:06,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what's on your mind tonight in regards to gaming?

1017
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:14,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I was curious about, it was actually a comment, I think it was AGI, I made it a while back.

1018
01:08:15,022 --> 01:08:17,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It was either AGI or you guys, because I listen to both of you a lot.

1019
01:08:18,207 --> 01:08:29,335
[SPEAKER_04]: They were worried about with the Wii's price point, this was back in October or September, about how since Nintendo was supposed to have all of these different consoles, how you would be able to walk into a store and find anyone with no problem.

1020
01:08:30,215 --> 01:08:38,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And therefore, they thought there would be a problem because people would see it as, you know, since it's already there, you know, it wasn't really that good or it wasn't that hot of an item type of thing.

1021
01:08:40,442 --> 01:08:42,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember if we said that.

1022
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:46,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that we would have said that because my kind of viewpoint on it is that

1023
01:08:46,904 --> 01:08:50,465
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know, a little bit of demand is a good thing, but this is too much.

1024
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:52,146
[SPEAKER_12]: This is too much.

1025
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:54,146
[SPEAKER_12]: This is exactly what Microsoft went through, you know?

1026
01:08:55,327 --> 01:08:55,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:08:55,767 --> 01:09:06,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was just kind of curious about what your thoughts were as how people were predicting now what happens, and now the exact opposite has happened where you cannot find a Wii anywhere, but you can almost walk into any store and find a PS3.

1028
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:14,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you know, but I wonder how much, I don't have any sales stats, I don't know, but how much of this is Nintendo making?

1029
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:16,191
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, how has production been at the Wii's?

1030
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Been pretty low.

1031
01:09:18,412 --> 01:09:27,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because what I understand is that we all have this impression that the Wii's are just rolling off the freaking assembly line, but I believe I heard somewhere else that the actual amount of shipments that these places are getting are not weekly.

1032
01:09:28,635 --> 01:09:34,417
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they're not weekly, and I want to say the last shipment we got was in December, the next one we're getting is this week, and

1033
01:09:35,234 --> 01:09:36,234
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how long it's been.

1034
01:09:36,274 --> 01:09:38,175
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a few weeks since we've gotten anything.

1035
01:09:38,195 --> 01:09:39,235
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's because they're sold out.

1036
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:40,175
[SPEAKER_14]: They're sold out of that.

1037
01:09:40,195 --> 01:09:41,115
[SPEAKER_14]: They're sold out of DS.

1038
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:44,096
[SPEAKER_14]: They're sold out of Zelda, the GameCube Zelda.

1039
01:09:45,717 --> 01:09:47,417
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just way behind in everything.

1040
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:48,517
[SPEAKER_12]: They're too damn popular.

1041
01:09:49,337 --> 01:09:52,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And the thing with the PS3 being in stock is not because they're shipping a ton of units.

1042
01:09:53,078 --> 01:09:55,999
[SPEAKER_14]: It's because they're not selling as many units as they're shipping.

1043
01:09:56,419 --> 01:09:59,980
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just getting shipments every now and then, but they're just not selling them.

1044
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:03,936
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the hot item they thought it would be, or at least not yet.

1045
01:10:04,356 --> 01:10:09,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the system's not going to sell very well if there's only 13 games out for it, so that's a problem.

1046
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of curiosity, are you a Wii or PlayStation 3 owner yourself?

1047
01:10:15,122 --> 01:10:15,783
[SPEAKER_04]: A Wii and a 360.

1048
01:10:16,903 --> 01:10:18,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, so you're a Wii 60 camp.

1049
01:10:18,204 --> 01:10:19,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Any interest in PS3?

1050
01:10:19,305 --> 01:10:21,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me?

1051
01:10:21,566 --> 01:10:22,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Any interest in PS3?

1052
01:10:24,548 --> 01:10:25,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe down the line.

1053
01:10:26,249 --> 01:10:30,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It will depend on how many more exclusives leave Sony.

1054
01:10:31,547 --> 01:10:32,408
[SPEAKER_12]: He sounds just like me.

1055
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:40,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all I need to hear is basically like a Final Fantasy or a Kingdom Hearts on the 360 and I might be done with Sony.

1056
01:10:41,474 --> 01:10:41,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know.

1057
01:10:42,595 --> 01:10:49,900
[SPEAKER_12]: If Square came out tomorrow and announced Kingdom Hearts 3 for the 360, put a fork in Sony as far as I'm concerned.

1058
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:51,941
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know.

1059
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:55,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I say that kind of jokingly on here, but I don't know.

1060
01:10:56,064 --> 01:10:59,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's not forget that Katamari Damacy was a very excellent

1061
01:11:00,271 --> 01:11:02,172
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be at third-party exclusive.

1062
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:04,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I mean, I guess all these games are third-party exclusives.

1063
01:11:04,413 --> 01:11:05,213
[SPEAKER_12]: They went over to Sony.

1064
01:11:05,273 --> 01:11:06,354
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just an awesome game.

1065
01:11:06,954 --> 01:11:10,096
[SPEAKER_12]: And PS2 took a little while to build up some steam.

1066
01:11:10,216 --> 01:11:12,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't buy a PS2 on launch day.

1067
01:11:12,597 --> 01:11:13,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't buy one for a while.

1068
01:11:13,597 --> 01:11:15,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I bought one until Final Fantasy X came out.

1069
01:11:16,139 --> 01:11:19,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get one until the slim units came out is when I got my PS2.

1070
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you know what?

1071
01:11:20,221 --> 01:11:21,561
[SPEAKER_12]: I had an import one for the longest time.

1072
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:22,041
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it was.

1073
01:11:23,682 --> 01:11:26,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anyhow, anything else you want to share with tonight's program?

1074
01:11:27,344 --> 01:11:27,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1075
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:28,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I had another question for you guys.

1076
01:11:28,925 --> 01:11:29,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it

1077
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:37,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably a little late, but I was wondering if there was any particular game or series in 2006 that you guys wanted to play but didn't get to?

1078
01:11:40,673 --> 01:11:46,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Any particular series or game in 2006 that we wanted to play but didn't get to?

1079
01:11:46,455 --> 01:11:48,335
[SPEAKER_04]: But didn't have the time to get to or whatnot?

1080
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe something you're looking forward to, but you just didn't get to it for whatever reasons?

1081
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,121
[SPEAKER_12]: How about games I didn't spend enough time with that I wanted to spend more time with?

1082
01:11:59,362 --> 01:12:00,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Trauma Center.

1083
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:03,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually did play a lot of Trauma Center.

1084
01:12:04,544 --> 01:12:05,684
[SPEAKER_12]: The Final Fantasy games.

1085
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:10,406
[SPEAKER_12]: I played 12 enough to know that I put in a pretty good chunk of hours.

1086
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:11,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I went up to the double digits in hours.

1087
01:12:12,507 --> 01:12:16,929
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I could have spent more time with that and I needed to play Final Fantasy 3 enough.

1088
01:12:17,429 --> 01:12:21,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I never did get Cooking Mama and Jamie won't shut up about it so I know I needed to check that one out.

1089
01:12:22,691 --> 01:12:24,732
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to think what other...

1090
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:30,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Have any of you guys tried out the Shadow Hearts RPG series?

1091
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,881
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard of it, and I've heard really good things about it, and I have a friend who's playing it, but I haven't played it myself.

1092
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:00,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that something you think ought to be on my list?

1093
01:13:02,062 --> 01:13:03,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, they're excellent games.

1094
01:13:03,403 --> 01:13:04,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they have three of them out now.

1095
01:13:04,703 --> 01:13:06,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how well they sell.

1096
01:13:06,463 --> 01:13:09,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they sell well enough to where the sequels have been coming out.

1097
01:13:10,004 --> 01:13:14,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I think it's one of them that flies under a lot of people's radar for whatever reason.

1098
01:13:14,606 --> 01:13:15,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Are those on GameCube?

1099
01:13:17,066 --> 01:13:17,547
[SPEAKER_12]: PS2.

1100
01:13:17,787 --> 01:13:18,267
[SPEAKER_12]: PS2?

1101
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:20,147
[SPEAKER_12]: I am thinking of something else.

1102
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard of it.

1103
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:21,948
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard of it, too.

1104
01:13:22,008 --> 01:13:22,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't really played it.

1105
01:13:23,689 --> 01:13:24,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I still wanted to play Akami.

1106
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:25,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Send some info to my email.

1107
01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:26,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out.

1108
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:26,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll at least rent it if nothing else.

1109
01:13:45,962 --> 01:13:49,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and then one quick thought and then I'll clear the line for you guys.

1110
01:13:49,704 --> 01:13:50,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1111
01:13:50,844 --> 01:13:55,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play pre-orders being sold out with GameStop and EB?

1112
01:13:56,086 --> 01:13:59,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play bundles being sold out with GameStop and EB?

1113
01:13:59,728 --> 01:13:59,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1114
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:02,929
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of that?

1115
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:03,970
[SPEAKER_14]: What do I think of that?

1116
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know anybody else that's doing pre-orders for that?

1117
01:14:06,611 --> 01:14:13,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know a lot of local mom and pop stores are doing pre-orders because I know we got our allocations and...

1118
01:14:14,643 --> 01:14:19,705
[SPEAKER_14]: We got quite a bit of units allocated to us, so I'm surprised that they're sold out already.

1119
01:14:21,726 --> 01:14:24,207
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hearing Wii Play's not worth it unless you need the controller.

1120
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:26,908
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.

1121
01:14:27,008 --> 01:14:30,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's getting in front of the controller, and it's basically almost like a free game with it.

1122
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,330
[SPEAKER_12]: It's $50, right?

1123
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:32,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it $49.99?

1124
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:33,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was $39.99.

1125
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:33,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it $39?

1126
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:33,911
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's $40.

1127
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:34,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wrong.

1128
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:34,191
$49.99.

1129
01:14:34,231 --> 01:14:34,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1130
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for taking my call, guys.

1131
01:14:44,361 --> 01:14:45,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, big fan as always.

1132
01:14:46,002 --> 01:14:46,522
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

1133
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:48,243
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate the call and the game recommendation.

1134
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:48,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, buddy.

1135
01:14:49,804 --> 01:14:50,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, talk to you later.

1136
01:14:50,645 --> 01:14:50,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

1137
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:52,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

1138
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:54,547
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like I said, we have day jobs and all that stuff.

1139
01:14:54,567 --> 01:14:56,849
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't always get around to playing everything, but we try.

1140
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:58,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Between the three of us, we play an awful lot.

1141
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:05,014
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I like to play a lot of types of role-playing games, although somehow I missed that one.

1142
01:15:05,174 --> 01:15:11,338
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki likes to play the shoot and kill the hooker type games, and Jamie likes to play really weird shit.

1143
01:15:13,268 --> 01:15:14,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you play weird?

1144
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:16,751
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you like to play Kingdom Hearts.

1145
01:15:16,771 --> 01:15:17,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I do.

1146
01:15:17,331 --> 01:15:40,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say, there's a funny website I read about today, I forgot to mention, TheBigBoxProject.com It's about this guy who needed to, he sent back a console, an Xbox 360 console to the actual, you know, to Microsoft originally, and the problem is they sent it back and it's still busted, so they want to

1147
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:55,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I guess between the time that he sent the first one and the second one needs to go back, they've changed their policy and they want him to pay Debit Fixed or whatever, so he's like, okay, fine, if that's the case, then I'm gonna send this in the biggest fucking box I can find.

1148
01:15:55,499 --> 01:16:06,666
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's trying to pay for, to get one of those, like, um, rail car crates, like the big giant, you know, rail cars to deliver this thing in, and, um,

1149
01:16:07,518 --> 01:16:12,562
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny because on the website, if you go to it, it has this little dialogue on here.

1150
01:16:12,682 --> 01:16:14,943
[SPEAKER_14]: It says, how big is your repair center?

1151
01:16:14,983 --> 01:16:24,410
[SPEAKER_14]: And then their technician's like, I don't see how that pertains to the situation, sir, because I'm going to send you my broken Xbox in the biggest damn box you've ever seen.

1152
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:27,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Will it be filled with little styrofoam pellets?

1153
01:16:27,232 --> 01:16:28,153
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I want to know.

1154
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:29,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only hope.

1155
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:32,296
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only imagine it will.

1156
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:42,280
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like somebody pokes a little hole in the box and suddenly they're under a mountain of styrofoam pellets.

1157
01:16:45,121 --> 01:16:48,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Or just, can you wrap the Xbox in that much bubble wrap?

1158
01:16:49,082 --> 01:16:50,822
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be wrapped in duct tape.

1159
01:16:51,202 --> 01:16:52,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Solid duct tape.

1160
01:16:52,803 --> 01:17:01,965
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a better use of your money right there is to take the box and wrap the whole box in like, I don't know, two feet of duct tape.

1161
01:17:02,225 --> 01:17:03,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Two feet thick.

1162
01:17:03,426 --> 01:17:04,326
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would be awesome.

1163
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:04,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Just send it.

1164
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,080
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

1165
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:30,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm okay.

1166
01:17:31,732 --> 01:17:32,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Just making sure.

1167
01:17:33,193 --> 01:17:33,633
[SPEAKER_12]: Need a hug?

1168
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:35,474
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I need food.

1169
01:17:35,634 --> 01:17:36,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, food.

1170
01:17:36,174 --> 01:17:36,634
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.

1171
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:37,255
[SPEAKER_07]: No coffee.

1172
01:17:37,295 --> 01:17:38,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to sleep eventually.

1173
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:38,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, food.

1174
01:17:38,996 --> 01:17:41,037
[SPEAKER_12]: To get to the food, we have to get to our final thoughts.

1175
01:17:41,337 --> 01:17:42,798
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to wrap this thing up.

1176
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:44,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys so much for listening to us.

1177
01:17:44,959 --> 01:17:45,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go around and get the final thoughts.

1178
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:46,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1179
01:17:48,661 --> 01:17:51,122
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is I need to play more Resistance.

1180
01:17:52,983 --> 01:17:59,146
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is I'm getting my PlayStation 2 back from my friend because I have this urge to play Kingdom Hearts ever since I got back from Disneyland.

1181
01:17:59,738 --> 01:18:00,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn Disneyland.

1182
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:01,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Damn it.

1183
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, do you know I subscribed a video podcast this week to talk about Disneyland?

1184
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:07,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And, uh, yeah.

1185
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:08,744
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty sad.

1186
01:18:08,965 --> 01:18:09,905
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm turning into Jamie.

1187
01:18:10,426 --> 01:18:11,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, your final thought.

1188
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:15,910
[SPEAKER_12]: You need some gas, X?

1189
01:18:16,270 --> 01:18:16,410
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1190
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,152
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have anything else to say?

1191
01:18:19,832 --> 01:18:21,894
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have a certain phrase you say every week on the show?

1192
01:18:22,935 --> 01:18:23,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Kiss my ass!

1193
01:18:28,178 --> 01:18:28,879
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not gonna say, uh,

1194
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:30,480
[SPEAKER_12]: to reject.

1195
01:18:30,841 --> 01:18:31,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss my ass.

1196
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:32,222
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1197
01:18:32,302 --> 01:18:32,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Fine.

1198
01:18:32,562 --> 01:18:33,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just checking.

1199
01:18:33,643 --> 01:18:35,284
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to make sure that's the official final thought.

1200
01:18:35,904 --> 01:18:36,225
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1201
01:18:36,865 --> 01:18:37,305
