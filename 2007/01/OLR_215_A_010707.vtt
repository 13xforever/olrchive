00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Music

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, January 7th, 2007, Xbox 360 upgrade rumors abound,

00:19.000 --> 00:25.000
Nintendo partners with an MMO developer, and prepare to waste even more time with Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
Music

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Welcome back, live listeners, to a new year of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
We are that radio program on the interweb dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
You will be like us, of greatest compulsory.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
One of us, one of us.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
How are you, my dear?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Upgraded.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Upgraded.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I heard because you made me play DDR, you bitch.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
DDR was fun today.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
It was fun.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Good times.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It was fun.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Say hello as well to recently upgraded tech master, Loki.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Hello.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Now with more anger and angst.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
It's great.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Sure.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, all right.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Now how you doing?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Good.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
You going to Macworld?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Oh yeah, totally.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm there.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
All right.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Welcome, by the way, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I know we got some new listeners while we were off on holiday for a little while.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Thanks as well to all the sites that joined us last week for the New Year's Eve special.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
And then they turned around and pimped us out on their respective sites.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
We really appreciate you guys doing that.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
So I know we got some new listeners from that.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
So just to kind of set the stage, since it is a new year, let's do the whole spiel about what we're all about.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Again, since it is new year, 2007.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
So Orange Lounge Radio, we formed in the year 2002.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
And we actually all met playing DDR.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Go figure.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
But you know, you remember when arcades were actually kind of cool and like a lot of people went there.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
And you know, it wasn't just about the little ticket spitting games and the place was riddled with children.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
When arcades were cool, Dark Soccer, myself and Loki all met up.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
And we just decided, you know, because Dark Soccer and I had kind of known each other a little bit before that.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
We were doing another radio program under station live.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And we thought, hey, let's do a show about video games.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay. And then, you know, Loki joined us for that.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
And here we are almost five years later, still doing it.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
So the show started about music video games.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
So sometimes you hear Orange Lounge Radio, the Bobani radio station, which, you know, we still love our music based games.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
But we like to think that we are gaming fans first.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
We just love video games in general.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
So that's what the show is all about now.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
So the show we try to present to you guys here every week is that we go over the news.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And yeah, you know, we only do a show once a week.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
We only do a show once a week.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
So you're not always going to get the latest and greatest here.

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
We do have the fortunate luck of having Loki working in the industry in an area that most media doesn't think to look in, which is distribution.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
So sometimes we get some pretty good exclusives that way.

03:02.000 --> 03:11.000
But otherwise, you know, we're kind of like we imagine one thing we used to do when we were at the arcades is that, you know, remember when we did like the Wednesday night, we'd get together, play DDR.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
And then what do we do afterwards?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
We went to Brookfield's and just, you know, talk.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Pinned out?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, well, we ate a lot and then we nerded out talking about stuff.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
So that's kind of what we are.

03:21.000 --> 03:30.000
We're the folks sitting around the dinner table at, you know, your local diner talking about games and talking smack when appropriate and talking about good things.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
And we like to invite guests to our table once in a while from the gaming industry, hoping to have some good names on in 2007.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
And we like to invite all of you.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
We like to fill up the restaurant with our listeners.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
We know that the majority of our listeners catch us on the audio blog, also known as podcast, which is released every Monday and Wednesday.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
But we also have our live listeners.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on Orange Lounge Radio, orangeloungeradio.com.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
We have a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week station.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
We're not the only show on it.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
In fact, every weeknight but Monday, you can hear some type of nerd program on the station.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
Tuesday nights, at least for right now, just the first Tuesday of every month.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
But we're hoping to have something to fill in the gaps in the interim.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
We have pump up the volume and then something unannounced that will be filling in the gaps on Tuesday in the interim.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
And then Wednesday nights, we have Guys on a Show, which is kind of like pop culture, geek culture stuff.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Thursday nights, STFU, which is really fast-paced game talk.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
It's more like a sports show.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Friday nights, we have Club OLR, which is just strictly music.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
And by the way, if you missed this week's Club OLR, you did a fantastic job mixing music this week, Loki.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm not just saying that.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
It was awesome.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
I loved it.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I thought it was great.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Would you do a rip-off of something else?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
No, no.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I didn't rip anything off.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I thought you did a great job.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Maybe you hurried through it or something.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
A little bit of trivia for those folks out there.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
Live Wire from the first episode was actually the second episode I did.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And then I flipped them.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
I see.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Because I liked one of them better than the other one.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Oh, I liked it.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
That was good.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
So, Saturday nights, Travis Donovan Live, geek sci-fi gaming 360.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
You know, whatever's on his mind, trying to bring a little dose of reality to you kids.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And of course, Sunday nights, we're here.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
All right, enough plugs for the side projects.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
We want to welcome all of our new and old listeners.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Those have been with us for so many years.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
And those that are just joining us, new this week.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
We had some noobs in chat tonight.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
So, we want to say hi to the noobs.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I think I saw NZ Gamer said he was a noob.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Hi, noob.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And somebody else said they were a noob, too.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
We had PH Alfan was a noob.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Hi, noob.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Welcome.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
So, and okay, let's get into how we like to start off every show.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
A little bit of how was your gaming week?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
What have you been playing?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
You made me play DDR.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I did.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
It was fun.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah, it was.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
I played also some BeatMania 3, was it the sixth, I think?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah, sixth mix.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Played some Cooking Mama.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Played some Pinball.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
We got our Who Done It back, which is now Trading Potter.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
And I joined Guild Wars this week.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.000
I didn't really care for it the last time I tried it, but I gave it a go this time around.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It was more fun.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
I don't know if I'm going to stick with it, but I figure at the very least, if I pay the

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
money for it, I can just play it whenever I want and don't have to worry about anything,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
so I'm thinking about it.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I've been playing with my friend Heather.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
It's pretty cool.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
All right.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
More Cooking Mama, huh?

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Have you beat Cooking Mama yet?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
No.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I came this close to buying Cooking Mama, but I'm holding out for the Wii version.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Yeah, I'm both.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Well, but the thing was-

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Completion!

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
I think Trauma Center was that much better on the Wii because I kind of just didn't get

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
around to playing the DS version.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
It was so awesome when I played it on the Wii, so I'm kind of holding off for my Mama

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
until the Wii version.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Don't worry.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I'll be showing Mama some love.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Don't worry.

06:47.000 --> 06:53.000
And to make a rebuttal to Holy Shonen, I think you're wrong.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What did Holy Shonen say?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
World of Warcraft is better than Guild Wars.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
World of Warcraft is just more annoying than Guild Wars.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
You know, it just kind of depends.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I don't know.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
They're almost exactly the same game.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't see what the point is.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I don't care.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
You don't-

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
I'm going to be playing them both.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
I understand because Guild Wars, you kind of level up to 20 and pretty much the entire

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
game is end game, but World of Warcraft has a little more in the interim because you know

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
you're going all the way to 60.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
There's a lot more to do in the interim.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
I guess if you're addicted to leveling, that's fine, but I think that Guild Wars takes a

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
little bit more skill to play.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I don't know.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I don't know.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
They're just very similar in game structure to me.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
I don't know.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't really prefer one to the other.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
I like the fact that Guild Wars I can go to whenever I want for free, like once I've bought

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
it, but you know that the game still has not dropped in price.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
If you want to get the old school Guild Wars, you have to pay the full 50 bucks for it,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
which is interesting.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, but keep in mind, say you're paying, what is it, $9.99 a month for-

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Wow?

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
For World of Warcraft, right?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Isn't it like $12 or $14.95?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I can't even remember.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, it's more like $12, but just-

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I think Final Fantasy is $12.95 and WoW is like $14.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
I can't remember.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Something like that.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
Anyway, you're going to end up paying more in a year for World of Warcraft than you are

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
going to pay for Guild Wars.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
I did feel like the WoW universe was way more expansive, though.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
There was a lot more to see in WoW.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
But the fundamental difference between the two, here's the fundamental difference between

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
the two.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
In Guild Wars, the entire game is what you would call an instance in WoW.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
That's alluring to some people, the fact that they play with exactly who they want

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
and that's it.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
You know what I mean?

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
It's like when you go out into the world, it's your world with your friends, and that's

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
either the upside to Guild Wars or it's the downside.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
If you like to meet new people, then Guild Wars may not be the better name.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Well, that's why you have their talent.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So you meet people there.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
Well, anyway, before we get into further argument, you know what?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Just play Final Fantasy XI.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Then you just wait all day for a party and never get anything done.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh, and I have to also tell GS68 that Ghost Squad is freaking fun as hell.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
What are you talking about?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
What?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
GS68.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I was talking about Ghost Squad.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
It's a gun game in the arcades.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
That game is freaking hot.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
I love that game.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I haven't played a good gun game in a while.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I haven't played it in ages, but Dan and I went and we just freaking played through

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
every mission and it was great.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Every time I want to play Time Crisis 4, somebody's on it.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Oh well.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It was pretty good.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Full of lots of stuff.

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
I got a PlayStation 3, and so I played lots of Resistance, and that game is far better

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
than Gears of War.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
I love that game.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It's very pretty.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
Looking at Resistance makes you question, hey, maybe the PlayStation 3 actually does

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
look better than the 360, and it really looks good.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
In fact, I found myself literally, between gunfights, standing there going, wow, this

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
looks really good.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
What a fucking change for the year 2007 on this program.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
You are gushing about Sony tonight.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
What the hell?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
No, no, no.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Hold on, hold on.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Is he drinking?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Resistance is good, okay?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Now...

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Didn't I tell you?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
That game is hot.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
It's awesome.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
That's it.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
But here's the problem, though.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
That is it.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Unfortunately, that's all that's out there.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I mean...

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Whoa, back up.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
You got a PS3?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, I got a PS3.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So I'm the only OLR host without a PS3?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Well, I got mine.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I got hooked up, okay, for the PlayStation 3.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Hey, hey.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I'm the only one without the cool new toys.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Yeah, I know.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Hey, Ron.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
What?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Hi.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
You're just not part of the PS Wii 60 club, so whatever.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I heart my Wii 60.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Screw you.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Anyway, so, no, seriously, though.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
It's fun.

10:34.000 --> 10:40.000
It really is fun, and I like it so much better than Gears of War.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
And the fact there's so many different difficulties you can play it on, so if you really aren't

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
all hardcore into it and stuff, you can have a good time with it.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
So it's very good.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I like it.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Um, Ridge Racer 7.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
Yes, I bought Ridge Racer 7 because Nelly actually wanted to play it.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
You know, and to be honest, I've played it, and it's exactly the same as Ridge Racer 6.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.500
It pretty much is.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.000
Well, now, you said earlier, though, that you felt Resistance was better than anything

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
you'd see on the 360.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.500
So, because Ridge Racer 7 and 6 are so similar, did you think that, graphically, the PlayStation

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
3 one was superior?

11:14.500 --> 11:15.500
No.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
Because I remember a while back, no.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.000
Both were comparing the two and saying the 360 version looked better.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I shouldn't say the 360 version, but you know what I mean.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Honestly, I couldn't pick up the differences.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.500
The only difference I saw was when you hit your Nitro, instead of the screen kind of

11:28.500 --> 11:31.500
turning white on the edges, it did this weird blur thing.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.000
But that's about it.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.500
So, I do like Ridge Racer 7 and how they have different ways you can customize your cars

11:38.500 --> 11:39.500
and stuff.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
That's kind of cool.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
So, yeah.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.500
Full Auto 2 was another one I picked up on that as well.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.500
I mean, I was a huge fan of Full Auto 1.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.500
Which is sold back this week.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.500
And, Full Auto 2 is, it's okay.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
It's just like the first game.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.500
I didn't really notice any differences.

11:56.500 --> 12:02.000
I mean, the graphics look a little different, but it's pretty much the first game all over

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
again.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
So, that's kind of cool.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.500
Let's do some chat room comments, because the chat room is on fire tonight.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.060
We've got a lot of new people in chat, and I think they've got three weeks of comments

12:10.060 --> 12:11.260
just penting up here.

12:11.260 --> 12:15.140
Mike W. says, Rob was also the only OLR host without a 360 for a while.

12:15.140 --> 12:16.140
That's true.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.140
I didn't get a 360 until March.

12:17.140 --> 12:18.140
To be honest, though.

12:18.140 --> 12:22.220
You eBayed it, or Craigslisted it or something and paid way too much for one, and she got

12:22.220 --> 12:23.780
the hookup because Dan was looking at it.

12:23.780 --> 12:28.380
To be honest, though, I wouldn't have bought a PS3 if I hadn't, you know.

12:28.380 --> 12:29.380
Yeah, you got a hookup.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.380
I know.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.380
You got a...

12:31.380 --> 12:32.380
Do you have to put out for that?

12:32.380 --> 12:33.380
No.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.380
Oh, that's good.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.380
Let's see.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.380
What else do we have here?

12:36.380 --> 12:37.380
We have...

12:37.380 --> 12:38.620
Jeremy Todd 1 says, Loki, I don't care what you say.

12:38.620 --> 12:39.620
Nellie is a gamer now.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.380
Nellie, of course, being Loki's wife.

12:42.380 --> 12:43.380
She's now reading.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.140
She's reading a new Harry Potter.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.340
Rama says, hey Rob, you're not missing anything with the Doorstop 3.

12:49.340 --> 12:51.060
You know, there really isn't anything...

12:51.060 --> 12:52.060
I actually...

12:52.060 --> 12:55.300
What I would want most out of it right now is the Blu-ray player, and fucking Tekken

12:55.300 --> 12:57.300
Dark Resurrection.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.300
That looks pretty badass.

12:58.300 --> 13:02.420
I haven't downloaded that, because it's in another country, and I don't like fighting

13:02.420 --> 13:05.100
games that much, so it's not a big deal for me.

13:05.100 --> 13:11.140
But I tried Grip Shift, and that blows ass, and I would not recommend it at all.

13:11.140 --> 13:12.580
Motorstorm is fucking awesome.

13:12.580 --> 13:13.580
I love the demo for Motorstorm.

13:13.580 --> 13:14.980
I did not like Motorstorm at all.

13:14.980 --> 13:15.980
Oh, I love Motorstorm.

13:15.980 --> 13:17.860
You didn't think it was slow?

13:17.860 --> 13:18.860
I thought it was slow.

13:18.860 --> 13:19.860
No, it's good.

13:19.860 --> 13:20.860
It's good.

13:20.860 --> 13:21.860
I like it.

13:21.860 --> 13:22.860
Is it just maybe the target?

13:22.860 --> 13:23.860
I don't know.

13:23.860 --> 13:26.580
Jaden says, next week, Loki takes back everything he said about Max, because he received a Mac

13:26.580 --> 13:28.540
and gloats about it.

13:28.540 --> 13:30.260
Could this be the year of change for Loki?

13:30.260 --> 13:33.980
No, listen, if I got a free Mac, I would be selling that shit back.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.620
I'd actually probably smash it with a hammer, or give it to Nellie.

13:36.620 --> 13:37.620
She'd probably want it.

13:37.620 --> 13:40.260
But no, other than...

13:40.260 --> 13:43.020
Mac fans, don't turn us off, because I heart Max, and so does Jamie.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.020
He's just crazy.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.020
I just don't like them.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.700
I'm sure we're building a PC.

13:46.700 --> 13:51.540
And I don't know if anyone's seen the new pictures of the new VAIO, but my god, Sony's

13:51.540 --> 13:53.380
copying Apple now.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.380
That's pretty bad.

13:54.380 --> 13:57.840
Anyways, so back in the games, real quick.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.840
So yeah, I played that Gran Turismo HD.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.500
It actually looks better than the one at E3, but not by much.

14:04.500 --> 14:09.100
So thank god it's free, because I sure as hell wouldn't buy that piece of shit.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.620
I don't like Gran Turismo, so that's just me.

14:11.620 --> 14:16.320
It looks pretty, I guess, but I don't know.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.780
It seems to me, and this is what I've noticed with a lot of the games on there, seems to

14:20.780 --> 14:25.260
be a lot of these racing games, because that's mainly what I've been playing, have the kind

14:25.260 --> 14:29.700
of okay foreground stuff, and they have this really high-res background image that's kind

14:29.700 --> 14:30.980
of plastered on there.

14:30.980 --> 14:34.340
I don't know if you've noticed that in some of the pictures of Gran Turismo HD and Motor

14:34.340 --> 14:35.340
Storm and stuff.

14:35.340 --> 14:39.740
It's kind of simple than this big high-res thing that looks really pretty, and people

14:39.740 --> 14:44.740
are thinking that it's rendered, but it's not.

14:44.740 --> 14:46.060
Is that it for your gaming week?

14:46.060 --> 14:48.900
Call of Duty 3 multiplayer on the 360 was awesome.

14:48.900 --> 14:54.000
I love that game, but I think I'm going to play Resistance instead, and of course, Grand

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Theft Auto Vices.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.500
Have you played Resistance online?

14:56.500 --> 14:59.420
I haven't played it online yet.

14:59.420 --> 15:03.940
I'm looking forward to doing that, but I've been too busy playing the story mode in it,

15:03.940 --> 15:06.580
and I love the story mode.

15:06.580 --> 15:10.620
Even with no achievements to unlock, this is amazing to me.

15:10.620 --> 15:13.840
The thing that's kind of cool about those, they sort of have an achievement system for

15:13.840 --> 15:14.840
that one game.

15:14.840 --> 15:19.040
You unlock these skill points, they call them, and it actually unlocks different things like

15:19.040 --> 15:20.380
costumes and stuff.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.260
So like in Excite Truck and Burnout, you get trophies.

15:23.260 --> 15:27.660
Yeah, something like that, but what's kind of neat though is when you play through the

15:27.660 --> 15:31.540
whole game, it unlocks more weapons, and you can go back and play through again, and then

15:31.540 --> 15:36.900
you can unlock harder difficulties and stuff, and you get more skins for multiplayer.

15:36.900 --> 15:40.740
But I do want to try out 40 player multiplayer online with that.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.740
I think that'd be crazy.

15:42.740 --> 15:46.100
Alright, is that it for your gaming week?

15:46.100 --> 15:47.100
That is it.

15:47.100 --> 15:51.580
Oh, and by the way, just real quick, real quick, Playstation 3, their download thing,

15:51.580 --> 15:54.740
okay, fucking sucks, balls, okay?

15:54.740 --> 15:59.680
The fact that it takes like an hour to download something, and you can't do anything while

15:59.680 --> 16:04.300
it's downloading, that fucking sucks, and they need to fix that, okay, now I'm done.

16:04.300 --> 16:09.460
Quick comment on the Playstation 3 from Jared Joe in chat, I love the potential of my PS3

16:09.460 --> 16:13.940
so far, I can't wait for it to unleash itself, I have Resistance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance,

16:13.940 --> 16:15.520
and both of those games are fantastic.

16:15.520 --> 16:21.540
I had Genji, notice I said I had Genji, so, couldn't stand the enemy crabs, I'm sure.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.660
I have the demo, but I haven't played it yet.

16:23.660 --> 16:28.540
Alright, my gaming week, okay, when I sat down a couple weeks ago to think about my

16:28.540 --> 16:34.360
top ten games of 2006, I came to the realization that Oblivion really was probably, I think,

16:34.360 --> 16:38.180
the second best game of 2006, I did name Zelda Twilight Princess number one, but I really

16:38.180 --> 16:43.260
thought Oblivion was number two, but then I realized, like, I hadn't really fully immersed

16:43.260 --> 16:48.540
myself into Oblivion, I'm not sure why, like I played it, and I kind of did the whole sandbox

16:48.540 --> 16:51.500
thing, but I just kind of always fucked around in that game, I never really sat down and

16:51.500 --> 16:55.820
played the story, oh my god, I have wasted so much time on Oblivion this week, it's not

16:55.820 --> 17:00.780
even funny, like, I allowed myself to totally get immersed in it, and just, oh my heck,

17:00.780 --> 17:04.920
I think I'm like six months late from everybody else, but I can't stop playing it, it's crazy.

17:04.920 --> 17:09.260
I haven't sold mine back yet, but that's because I like going in every now and then, punching

17:09.260 --> 17:11.460
animals, that's just me.

17:11.460 --> 17:15.300
It's fun to just sign on once in a while, and I say sign on because the game to me,

17:15.300 --> 17:19.980
it really feels like an MMO, just with the people acting like real people, it's crazy,

17:19.980 --> 17:24.500
it's so weird, it would be really interesting if Bethesda made an Elder Scrolls MMO, that

17:24.500 --> 17:27.540
would be craziness, I don't know, it would be very interesting.

17:27.540 --> 17:32.140
Anyway, so Oblivion, hours and hours sucked into that game this week, because I'm just

17:32.140 --> 17:38.500
a late bloomer in that regard, but I played Halo 2 of all things, some of my college buddies,

17:38.500 --> 17:42.760
way back in the day, like when we were all at college, I was off at Chico and they were

17:42.760 --> 17:49.560
at Sonoma State, we used to sign online and play Quake over the modem every week, once

17:49.560 --> 17:54.140
a week we played Quake, and we decided to try and bring that back a little bit and be

17:54.140 --> 17:58.180
in touch, because now we live all over, my buddy Garret is in town, but Bill's off in

17:58.180 --> 18:02.540
New York City, and Matt's all traveling around the world, so we kind of tried to connect

18:02.540 --> 18:04.900
through Xbox Live, so we played Halo this week.

18:04.900 --> 18:09.300
But what's really funny, well Halo 2, we were playing Halo 2 online, we all suck at it,

18:09.300 --> 18:12.780
but that's the fun part of it, when you're playing against other people who suck at Halo,

18:12.780 --> 18:13.780
it's pretty fun.

18:13.780 --> 18:18.700
But what's really funny about what happened during it is that we left it on so that anybody

18:18.700 --> 18:22.660
from our friends list could join the game, and somebody that joined the game was gamer

18:22.660 --> 18:28.980
Andy, because he has his site, gamerandy.com, and he was signing on to say, I'm sorry, because

18:28.980 --> 18:31.900
he got an invite to the New Year's show, but just scheduling conflicts, he wasn't able

18:31.900 --> 18:35.620
to make it on, so he was coming on to say, sorry, I couldn't make it, we'll have to make

18:35.620 --> 18:38.340
up, and we'll definitely have him on the show some other time, because he's a really cool

18:38.340 --> 18:44.620
guy, but oh my god, he kicked all our asses horribly at Halo, he's like, oh, I'm not any

18:44.620 --> 18:48.900
good, he's very humble, he's like, I haven't played in a year and a half, I suck at Halo,

18:48.900 --> 18:50.500
and he just wiped all of us.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.300
My friend Matt's pretty good, so he was giving him some competition, but we, oh god.

18:53.300 --> 18:58.540
I really need to buy Halo 2, because, you know, I have, I think it was fun when I played,

18:58.540 --> 19:03.660
you know, briefly, a long time ago, but I really, I'm not that great at first person

19:03.660 --> 19:09.180
shooters sometimes, I mean, when we're playing Call of Duty 3, all we played out is rocket

19:09.180 --> 19:10.580
launchers, sniper rifles.

19:10.580 --> 19:13.100
Yeah, that's actually what we were playing was the rockets, and that game was kind of

19:13.100 --> 19:15.940
fun, because that's easy to kill someone in rockets, so.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.940
Yeah, but, yeah, just rockets and just sniper rifles.

19:18.940 --> 19:23.740
Can we form a clan for, like, I suck at Halo, I mean, I realize we have the OL Army, but

19:23.740 --> 19:27.580
I, there's actually good players in the OL Army, we have some people that are, like,

19:27.580 --> 19:30.660
level 21, can we get, like, level 1 for life, Joe?

19:30.660 --> 19:36.060
Dude, I suck completely, I suck ass at Halo, so.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.660
When Halo 3 comes out, I'm scared, I'm seriously scared.

19:38.660 --> 19:40.420
We'll just play, because I'll buy Halo 3.

19:40.420 --> 19:41.420
Okay, there you go.

19:41.420 --> 19:45.060
I'm getting a legendary edition, so I have a helmet at my desk, but that's about it.

19:45.060 --> 19:49.060
And then otherwise, I haven't been playing a lot, I mean, the arcade, of course, DDR

19:49.060 --> 19:53.580
and stuff, but otherwise, I got, oh, I got 200 of 200 achievement points in New Rally

19:53.580 --> 19:56.380
X, thank you very much.

19:56.380 --> 20:00.940
Which is sadly the first arcade game I've gotten all the achievement points on, and

20:00.940 --> 20:04.660
I'm the only one on my friends list that has played the damn game, and I know that because

20:04.660 --> 20:08.100
I'm the only one with a high score on the list, and I have, like, 70-something friends

20:08.100 --> 20:11.980
on Xbox Live and not a damn other person's played the game except me.

20:11.980 --> 20:17.500
But you know what, the only reason I bought it, I remember from my childhood, okay, so

20:17.500 --> 20:18.500
don't hate.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.980
I remember Rally X in the good old days.

20:19.980 --> 20:20.980
Now that you're an old man.

20:20.980 --> 20:21.980
I know.

20:21.980 --> 20:26.740
All right, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight real quick, since we're done with

20:26.740 --> 20:28.140
our gaming week.

20:28.140 --> 20:33.140
DMN over from STFU, our Thursday night program on Orange Launch Radio, wanted me to mention,

20:33.140 --> 20:36.140
they're going to have the dude from VG Cats on this week.

20:36.140 --> 20:37.140
Lucky bastard.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.140
How are they?

20:38.140 --> 20:41.740
Their show's like five weeks old, and they're already landing these people.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.540
We've been around for five fucking years, and people are like, who are you?

20:44.540 --> 20:46.620
Why should I come on your program?

20:46.620 --> 20:51.100
What's Orange Lounge have to do with video games?

20:51.100 --> 20:54.140
So I say STFU to all of you.

20:54.140 --> 20:57.020
Don't forget all our other live programming on Orange Lounge Radio again, and of course

20:57.020 --> 21:00.220
we wanted to say, take a moment to thank, again, all of our New Year's Eve people we

21:00.220 --> 21:01.820
had on this week.

21:01.820 --> 21:07.300
We hope to incorporate guests, not just from the gaming industry, but other gaming podcasts

21:07.300 --> 21:09.180
and people you see out there in the gaming media.

21:09.180 --> 21:13.100
We're trying to think of ways to incorporate that on into 2007, because the New Year's

21:13.100 --> 21:17.360
episodes seem to be really well received, and you guys seem to dig that, so definitely

21:17.360 --> 21:19.580
we'll do stuff more like that in the future.

21:19.580 --> 21:20.580
It was cool.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.580
Good times.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.580
All right, how about some gaming news?

21:22.580 --> 21:24.140
Let's talk some smack about some gaming news.

21:24.140 --> 21:25.980
Loki, start us off.

21:25.980 --> 21:32.460
Well, apparently there's a small little convention going on called CES, Consumer Electronics

21:32.460 --> 21:37.740
Show, that I completely forgot about, and I was like, oh yeah, CES is going on.

21:37.740 --> 21:43.620
Anyways, so I'm kind of, you know, starting that all off, there's been some rumors coming

21:43.620 --> 21:52.860
out about a brand new version of the Xbox 360, now with HDMI, codenamed the Zephyr,

21:52.860 --> 21:56.740
and apparently there's been shots floating around from Engadget.

21:56.740 --> 22:03.900
I know there was some video on there from Xbox scene, so definitely something that's

22:03.900 --> 22:08.380
probably going to be out there at some point, although a lot of people are bitching, saying,

22:08.380 --> 22:10.220
oh, what about the early adopters?

22:10.220 --> 22:15.100
You screwed all them, but you know, I'm just like, I don't need HDMI.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.100
Whatever.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.100
My TV doesn't have HDMI.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.620
What, Nintendo does this shit all the time?

22:18.620 --> 22:19.620
No one seems to mind.

22:19.620 --> 22:20.620
Yeah, exactly.

22:20.620 --> 22:25.580
I mean, seriously, I mean, you know, with the DS Lite, I mean, sure, my panties were

22:25.580 --> 22:29.380
ruffled a little bit at the fact that, you know, the DS Lite comes out not even like

22:29.380 --> 22:33.380
a year after the DS is already on shelves and I bought the first printing of the DS,

22:33.380 --> 22:34.380
but what can you do?

22:34.380 --> 22:35.780
I mean, this thing is inevitable.

22:35.780 --> 22:39.180
Yeah, really, I mean, for me, it's not a big deal.

22:39.180 --> 22:44.300
I mean, I guess later on down the line, if I really had an issue with this, I can just,

22:44.300 --> 22:50.180
I guess, buy another one or something, but I don't know, my TV doesn't have HDMI, so

22:50.180 --> 22:51.180
it's no good for me.

22:51.180 --> 22:56.500
I think my TV does, but, you know, I go back and I think about how long I was like, I have

22:56.500 --> 22:59.980
to get a component cable for the Wii, I have to get a component cable, I have to have like

22:59.980 --> 23:02.980
the best video ever, and then it really wasn't that big a difference.

23:02.980 --> 23:07.980
So I think like, is it really going to be a deal breaker that I can't, I don't get HDMI

23:07.980 --> 23:08.980
right away?

23:08.980 --> 23:15.260
I mean, chances are my 360 will break eventually anyway and I have to get a new one, so I'll

23:15.260 --> 23:16.820
just wait for that inevitability.

23:16.820 --> 23:22.260
Exactly, and a lot of people are saying also that the new 360 is going to, and I don't

23:22.260 --> 23:26.180
even know where they're pulling this info from, I mean, because I believe the HDMI part

23:26.180 --> 23:29.580
because we've seen pictures of it, but they're saying, oh, it's going to have a 120 gig hard

23:29.580 --> 23:36.940
drive and all this stuff, and the, you know, it's going to have the, you know, 65 nanometer

23:36.940 --> 23:40.380
chip sets in there and stuff.

23:40.380 --> 23:45.420
You know, really, the 120 gig hard drive will be something that they add on later.

23:45.420 --> 23:49.860
I mean, that's something that they'll have, you know, the offer that you can buy.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.500
It's not going to be probably included with this.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.060
I mean, I don't know.

23:55.060 --> 23:58.180
To be honest, all I think they're going to do is add this HDMI port.

23:58.180 --> 24:02.260
It's not going to be a brand new model of the 360, it's just going to be, now the 360s

24:02.260 --> 24:05.020
are coming out with HDMI ports on them.

24:05.020 --> 24:06.260
That is it.

24:06.260 --> 24:10.420
And they'll have the, you know, cooler processor in there, so, you know, lower the cost of

24:10.420 --> 24:15.180
the system, but I don't think they're going to do anything above and beyond this.

24:15.180 --> 24:18.980
The O, they could prove me wrong because I know there is one thing actually that's coming

24:18.980 --> 24:26.140
out of CS that they're talking about using the 360 as an ITV box, so that's going to

24:26.140 --> 24:28.300
be some stuff that's going to come out this week.

24:28.300 --> 24:34.380
Or they're talking about to be able to use it to watch web TV, so that's interesting.

24:34.380 --> 24:38.700
But I don't know, it's just, I don't think they're really going to try to do anything

24:38.700 --> 24:39.700
different.

24:39.700 --> 24:43.740
And also the other rumor was HD DVD drive built in, which I don't, that's not going

24:43.740 --> 24:44.740
to happen.

24:44.740 --> 24:49.660
I don't know, it's not a huge deal, I think, for me.

24:49.660 --> 24:54.620
And all those people that are really HDMI was important or something, buy a new system.

24:54.620 --> 24:58.500
Know your old one off, people will buy it, just buy a new system, I mean, just quit your

24:58.500 --> 24:59.500
bitching.

24:59.500 --> 25:04.860
Comments from our chat room, DDR Dollar Bill says, HDMI, don't care.

25:04.860 --> 25:10.740
Let's see, we have, I believe it was Paradox Vincent said, DS Fat sucks.

25:10.740 --> 25:16.420
And NM64 says, DS Lite is only worth it if you need a new DS or never had one.

25:16.420 --> 25:17.940
So some conflicting opinions there.

25:17.940 --> 25:18.940
I think the fat is fine.

25:18.940 --> 25:22.700
Did you know the DS fat is actually louder than the DS Lite, which is good for games

25:22.700 --> 25:27.100
like Elite Beat Agents and stuff when you need to drown other people out?

25:27.100 --> 25:31.780
But I do think overall I kind of prefer the Lite, and I'll probably get one eventually.

25:31.780 --> 25:36.580
But knowing Nintendo, there'll be some new color or some new redo they're going to do

25:36.580 --> 25:40.200
before the span of the DS Lite, or the DS in general, is over.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
So I'm waiting for that.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.980
Just like when the Game Boy Advance came out.

25:42.980 --> 25:47.680
I had the Game Boy Advance, the original one, and then they did the SP, and you know, fuck

25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
that shit.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.300
I am not buying another system all over again.

25:50.300 --> 25:53.300
Nintendo has done this with almost every single one of their consoles, I think.

25:53.300 --> 25:54.300
Remember the Nintendo?

25:54.300 --> 25:59.660
They did the top-loading one that looked like the Famicom later on, and then with, well

25:59.660 --> 26:05.040
I guess not really the Nintendo 64 or the Super Nintendo, but the 64 they had a rumble

26:05.040 --> 26:07.900
later on, and then you could add the RAM pack later on.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.420
Oh, and they had the Pokemon 64.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.420
Yeah, exactly.

26:10.420 --> 26:11.640
The Pokemon 64.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.020
They always try to pull this shit.

26:13.020 --> 26:14.620
With the little cheek slide up when you turn it on too.

26:14.620 --> 26:17.900
And don't think that they don't know that later on, you know, people are going to buy

26:17.900 --> 26:21.020
an extra DS because it's in a specific color.

26:21.020 --> 26:25.900
I mean, come on, it doesn't, it's not that hard to manufacture the DS in a different

26:25.900 --> 26:26.900
color.

26:26.900 --> 26:28.580
Ooh, ooh, I just thought though, Microsoft does that too.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.580
They've done it before.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.000
You know what kind of Xbox I have?

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
I don't have them.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
Yeah.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
I don't have the same Xbox most people have.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I have a Halo Xbox.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
That's the see-through green.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
I have a Halo Xbox.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
That's the see-through green.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.240
Yeah, but most people don't have that though.

26:39.240 --> 26:41.700
Most people have the big black brick, right?

26:41.700 --> 26:43.400
My big black brick died.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.820
Microsoft is not beyond redesigning their consoles.

26:45.820 --> 26:46.820
Exactly.

26:46.820 --> 26:50.900
Don't you think there will be a Halo 3 limited edition console, or do you think there will

26:50.900 --> 26:51.900
just be a faceplate?

26:51.900 --> 26:55.100
They can get it too, back with the Sega support streamcast.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.060
I think the faceplates are what they're doing now.

26:57.060 --> 27:02.020
That's a big thing, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a black console later, you know.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.340
I think that's something that's very possible.

27:05.340 --> 27:06.340
I don't know.

27:06.340 --> 27:07.500
We all know the Wii colors are coming.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
It's just a matter of time.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.500
Those are coming.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.500
Same with the PlayStation 3 colors.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.500
You're going to see those as well.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.500
I mean, come on.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.780
It's just, this is not, I mean, look at the PlayStation 2.

27:16.780 --> 27:19.780
They have silver, pink, I mean, come on.

27:19.780 --> 27:20.780
It's just, everybody does it.

27:20.780 --> 27:23.580
Because I need something to match my cabinet that I got at IKEA.

27:23.580 --> 27:27.500
Like, oh my God, I got to totally get a pink one for my girlfriend because she's going

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
to totally appreciate it.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.260
And when you give it to her, she's like, wow, this is so pretty.

27:31.260 --> 27:37.460
What the fuck am I going to play on it?

27:37.460 --> 27:39.980
You know why they keep doing this, you guys?

27:39.980 --> 27:43.980
It's because people are retarded and they will buy this shit.

27:43.980 --> 27:46.660
They will buy a blue DS when it comes out because it's blue.

27:46.660 --> 27:50.020
They'll buy a pink DS when it comes out because it's pink.

27:50.020 --> 27:52.940
Because people are retarded and they don't understand there's websites out there that

27:52.940 --> 27:59.100
make custom colored DS's that you can order brand new in any fucking color of the rainbow

27:59.100 --> 28:04.300
that you want instead of having to wait for Nintendo to put it out.

28:04.300 --> 28:07.740
You know, there's a conversation going on in chat right now that has me thinking a little

28:07.740 --> 28:08.740
bit.

28:08.740 --> 28:12.940
Do you think, do you think the black Wii will be a little bit bigger than the white Wii?

28:12.940 --> 28:16.780
Yeah, and the yellow Wii is going to be super tiny.

28:16.780 --> 28:19.180
Yeah, okay.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.860
You can address those cards and letters to lowkey at orangelawnsradio.com.

28:21.860 --> 28:24.740
Hey, you started it, okay.

28:24.740 --> 28:27.660
Let's just move right along to talking about Halo 3.

28:27.660 --> 28:30.180
Of course, we were talking about that a little bit.

28:30.180 --> 28:31.640
And the beta testing, right?

28:31.640 --> 28:34.580
You had everybody slam that site, try to get into the beta test.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.380
And you'll find out this month if you got into the beta test.

28:37.380 --> 28:42.780
But if you didn't get in that way, there is the rule of three.

28:42.780 --> 28:47.860
And I don't know why else you would call it that unless you want people to say the rule

28:47.860 --> 28:54.300
of three, the mysterious rule of three to get into the Halo 3 beta test.

28:54.300 --> 28:59.340
What's going to happen is that if you play three hours worth of Halo 2 multiplayer between

28:59.340 --> 29:05.940
Thursday the 1st of February and February 3rd, 2007, if you're among one of the first

29:05.940 --> 29:12.780
13,333 to register at Halo3.com right after that, then you will be part of the Halo 3

29:12.780 --> 29:13.780
beta.

29:13.780 --> 29:14.780
The other way to get into it?

29:14.780 --> 29:15.780
Buy Crackdown.

29:15.780 --> 29:18.340
I just buy Crackdown.

29:18.340 --> 29:22.020
I have to be honest, I'm kind of not caring anymore.

29:22.020 --> 29:27.100
Like I know I should think this Halo 3 beta is a big deal and OMG I can be the first on

29:27.100 --> 29:28.100
my block to play it.

29:28.100 --> 29:32.200
But now I'm to the point where I'm like, you know what, I'll just play the damn thing.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.700
It's going to be buggy, people are going to bitch, I'll just wait for it to...

29:36.700 --> 29:40.100
It was cool when it was like a beta thing and you didn't know how many people were going

29:40.100 --> 29:44.460
to get into it and you thought, oh hey, this is going to be only a couple thousand.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.820
That's kind of cool, you're like in the cool club now.

29:46.820 --> 29:51.260
Now where it's, oh anyone that buys this game will get into the beta, oh and this is another

29:51.260 --> 29:53.260
way to get into the beta.

29:53.260 --> 30:00.700
Why the fuck is a beta test like fucking incentive to buy something or do something?

30:00.700 --> 30:04.560
You're beta testing something and you don't realize that's actually work.

30:04.560 --> 30:11.420
You're working, I mean you're playing a game to find bugs, that's not exactly fun.

30:11.420 --> 30:17.460
Just wait, people, it's only a few more months away, shit.

30:17.460 --> 30:21.460
I don't know, I'm kind of over it, I'll play it when I play it.

30:21.460 --> 30:24.580
I don't have to be the first kid on the block to do it.

30:24.580 --> 30:28.660
Somebody in chat, who said this, said that it would probably fill up within five hours.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.820
Mike W. says that he predicts right here and now that the beta will fill up in five hours.

30:32.820 --> 30:34.820
I give it three.

30:34.820 --> 30:40.020
People will be on their consoles one minute after, play the three hours back to back to

30:40.020 --> 30:42.020
back and then be on Halo 3 immediately.

30:42.020 --> 30:44.620
There will be 13,333 people to do that.

30:44.620 --> 30:48.260
So I don't know why Microsoft bothered to make such a big window, seriously.

30:48.260 --> 30:51.540
I'm just going to buy Crackdown and play Crackdown.

30:51.540 --> 30:55.660
I'm telling you right now, if you want to get in that way, if you're not on there at

30:55.660 --> 30:58.900
midnight ready to play until 3am, forget it, write it off, you're not getting in.

30:58.900 --> 31:03.060
I'm sorry, you know that's how it's going to work.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.060
You know it.

31:04.060 --> 31:07.220
There's some people who got to play it anyway.

31:07.220 --> 31:08.220
Oh, oh really?

31:08.220 --> 31:09.220
Yep.

31:09.220 --> 31:10.220
Oh really?

31:10.220 --> 31:11.220
Yep.

31:11.220 --> 31:12.220
Who?

31:12.220 --> 31:13.220
Let's beat them up, take their lunch money.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.980
I think they could actually beat anyone of us.

31:15.980 --> 31:17.460
Oh really?

31:17.460 --> 31:22.460
Bungie actually flew over copies of the beta to the troops overseas.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.900
Oh yeah, they probably could keep my SCM.

31:24.900 --> 31:25.900
Yeah.

31:25.900 --> 31:26.900
Nevermind.

31:26.900 --> 31:27.900
Hearts.

31:27.900 --> 31:33.140
And basically let them have the free demo for Christmas, give it a try and I think that's

31:33.140 --> 31:34.140
pretty cool.

31:34.140 --> 31:35.140
That's kind of neat.

31:35.140 --> 31:40.600
That's something kind of different and I think a very interesting way and I bet you a lot

31:40.600 --> 31:45.580
of our troops are kind of into Halo 2 and 3 and all that stuff so I think that's kind

31:45.580 --> 31:46.580
of cool.

31:46.580 --> 31:50.900
And it's a good way I think to relieve some of the stress of having to be there.

31:50.900 --> 31:52.340
I think it was a really good thing.

31:52.340 --> 31:53.340
Yeah.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.340
That's neat.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.340
Yeah.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.340
Good job Bungie.

31:56.340 --> 32:00.300
Anyways, so more stuff for the 360.

32:00.300 --> 32:05.500
You know how they always have themes and stuff on Xbox Live and you know they're so wonderful

32:05.500 --> 32:08.820
how they don't show you what they look like before you buy them.

32:08.820 --> 32:14.780
Well thankfully there is a website now that will show you what they look like called DashboardThemes.com

32:14.780 --> 32:20.420
and you can go there before you buy a theme and check out what it looks like and possibly

32:20.420 --> 32:23.380
save your Xbox Live points.

32:23.380 --> 32:28.580
Unfortunately I would just save your Xbox Live points or the other thing you can do

32:28.580 --> 32:33.140
if you have a memory unit just go to your local game store or whatever that has an Xbox

32:33.140 --> 32:39.140
360 kiosk and download some of that shit for free because lots of it you pay for online

32:39.140 --> 32:41.620
you can download for free from there.

32:41.620 --> 32:45.740
Although from what I remember reading on this site the people were putting it together with

32:45.740 --> 32:47.180
their own money.

32:47.180 --> 32:52.580
So you know they do deserve some type of you know medallion or recognition from the community

32:52.580 --> 32:57.740
for putting together that public service because for whatever reason Microsoft isn't on top

32:57.740 --> 32:58.740
of it with their previews.

32:58.740 --> 33:03.280
I mean you can preview some stuff on Xbox.com to be fair but they're not very current and

33:03.280 --> 33:06.140
these guys you know they have it the day it comes out.

33:06.140 --> 33:10.500
So I think they deserve a round of applause from the gaming community.

33:10.500 --> 33:11.500
Yay.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.500
Alright.

33:12.500 --> 33:17.100
Well, other surprises that you might find.

33:17.100 --> 33:22.080
What's interesting is that this 14 year old boy who lives in Utah claims that he purchased

33:22.080 --> 33:28.820
a factory sealed copy of Madden 07 for the Xbox 360 and he put the disc in his system

33:28.820 --> 33:34.060
and up came not John Madden but hardcore pornography.

33:34.060 --> 33:35.780
That's a roster update.

33:35.780 --> 33:41.500
The boy immediately notified his parents and they're backing up the claim and said this

33:41.500 --> 33:42.560
is legit.

33:42.560 --> 33:49.260
Now Electronic Arts was contacted and they're working with the store that the game was bought

33:49.260 --> 33:53.340
from to see if maybe something funny went on here like maybe a disgruntled employee

33:53.340 --> 33:57.700
put some porn in there you know because how easy would it be to print out a Madden label

33:57.700 --> 34:00.900
like on your computer and then take a porn disc and like put it on there.

34:00.900 --> 34:06.100
It's a little harder because those are actually you know silkscreened onto the discs so.

34:06.100 --> 34:13.100
Yeah but if you're 14 and you don't know to look for that kind of stuff I mean don't you

34:13.100 --> 34:15.340
think someone could get away with that?

34:15.340 --> 34:18.760
You'd have to be pretty retarded although he does look pretty retarded.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.760
You're nice.

34:19.760 --> 34:25.020
You would have to be pretty retarded if you're a 14 year old boy and you get porn and go

34:25.020 --> 34:26.020
tell your parents.

34:26.020 --> 34:30.240
What problem did I know I got porn?

34:30.240 --> 34:31.240
Fuck that shit.

34:31.240 --> 34:32.900
You're hoarding that shit.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.900
You are putting that in the safest spot.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.960
That's like someone giving you diamonds you're like fuck that shit I'm going to hide this

34:38.960 --> 34:39.960
shit and no one.

34:39.960 --> 34:40.960
I'm playing Madden.

34:40.960 --> 34:41.960
Go away!

34:41.960 --> 34:46.660
Keep the door shut I'm playing Madden.

34:46.660 --> 34:50.340
Inviting all your friends over to play Madden.

34:50.340 --> 34:53.740
Building a shrine to the Madden disc in your bedroom.

34:53.740 --> 34:54.740
That's beautiful.

34:54.740 --> 34:58.100
Carol dude you're going to see the coolest copy of Madden you've ever seen.

34:58.100 --> 35:05.340
EA would quote regrets any embarrassment the matter has caused the family.

35:05.340 --> 35:07.440
That's a way to learn a lesson early.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.960
By the way one other quote that's so great here.

35:09.960 --> 35:14.780
According to a paper in Utah the standard examiner when Mahoney looked at the pornographic

35:14.780 --> 35:19.740
images his first thought was quote this is definitely not Madden.

35:19.740 --> 35:27.220
No it's NHL 2000 on Dreamcast.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.340
This looks more like Blitz League what the fuck.

35:29.340 --> 35:35.420
Listen up 2K if you want to win this war going on in the football world here's how to do

35:35.420 --> 35:36.420
it.

35:36.420 --> 35:37.420
More porn.

35:37.420 --> 35:43.580
Listen you don't need that's what they need to do NFL xxx just like BMX xxx except it

35:43.580 --> 35:45.620
doesn't have any NFL in it it's more porn.

35:45.620 --> 35:50.460
Okay very interesting Jeremy Todd one says Loki wouldn't you rather sue the game company

35:50.460 --> 35:53.500
and get millions rather than keep some porn you can find for free.

35:53.500 --> 35:58.100
You're 14 your parents are going to get that money fuck that shit keep the porn.

35:58.100 --> 36:05.780
Ravens Dolphin one said I found porn on my PSP memory card from EB I told nobody.

36:05.780 --> 36:08.060
Yeah was it a used game or a new one?

36:08.060 --> 36:12.300
It's a used game oh that game that was a new factory sealed game.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.300
That's fun.

36:13.300 --> 36:19.600
Fireboma says he notified his parents quote under long review this is porn quote hold

36:19.600 --> 36:25.060
on we have to go review got to go to the bathroom.

36:25.060 --> 36:29.500
Well speaking of something that has nothing to do with porn okay it might have been but

36:29.500 --> 36:31.700
that's not official.

36:31.700 --> 36:36.340
Guess who's leaving rare for more porn I mean for for not porn.

36:36.340 --> 36:38.140
The Pinatas.

36:38.140 --> 36:41.580
The Stamper brothers are leaving leaving rare.

36:41.580 --> 36:46.860
Wait didn't they like found it or something yep they were one of the well I guess two

36:46.860 --> 36:53.700
of the main folks behind rare and now they're gone by that they've gone to a quote pursue

36:53.700 --> 36:54.700
other opportunities.

36:54.700 --> 36:59.580
They're like they're all fuck this shit we make no more fucking pinata games fuck this

36:59.580 --> 37:00.780
we want killer instinct.

37:00.780 --> 37:04.780
Well wait wait a damn minute though Viva Pinata was the best thing rares put out in a while

37:04.780 --> 37:09.260
sadly they did put out didn't they.

37:09.260 --> 37:14.460
We promise just make a pinata game and we'll let you make killer instinct.

37:14.460 --> 37:19.300
What I want to know is what if Viva Pinata was not that bad I mean it's actually quite

37:19.300 --> 37:23.420
good it's a pleasant surprise of a game so don't knock it till you've tried it it's pretty

37:23.420 --> 37:24.420
fun game.

37:24.420 --> 37:29.240
I had way more fun with Viva Pinata than cameo and perfect dark zero combined end of story

37:29.240 --> 37:30.240
end of story.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.900
Okay well perfect dark zero is like bald.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.860
So if that's what yeah I know and I'm like if that's why they left was over Viva Pinata

37:35.860 --> 37:41.460
then bye don't let the door hit your ass on the way out but you know I what I want to

37:41.460 --> 37:45.860
know was did they leave this voluntary or is this one of those nice ways of saying they

37:45.860 --> 37:50.500
were asked to leave because the community was not too receptive to some of the recent

37:50.500 --> 37:54.420
games and I don't believe Viva Pinata is performing very well I don't think it's reaching the

37:54.420 --> 37:57.540
target audience they want I mean critically it's doing well but that doesn't always translate

37:57.540 --> 38:00.960
to money you know what I mean.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.460
There's actually an interview but I have to look a little bit more further into that but

38:04.460 --> 38:06.020
I think it's willing.

38:06.020 --> 38:09.420
Interesting do you think they'll start a rival company?

38:09.420 --> 38:12.180
I hope so.

38:12.180 --> 38:16.420
They should make one called uncommon.

38:16.420 --> 38:23.980
Wonder Dog Harold says they're just taking the money and running.

38:23.980 --> 38:29.780
DJ Morpheus says thanks to Viva I can't play my 360 right now and I think that's because

38:29.780 --> 38:33.500
I've seen his woman on there playing Viva Pinata non-stop because she's on my friends

38:33.500 --> 38:37.220
list and I could be looking at my Xbox friends list at one in the afternoon and look who's

38:37.220 --> 38:38.220
online playing Viva Pinata.

38:38.220 --> 38:42.300
You know what would be hilarious is if you smacked that woman enough times that she like

38:42.300 --> 38:45.260
locked up your system for like an hour or something like that.

38:45.260 --> 38:46.260
What?

38:46.260 --> 38:49.460
No I said that'd be funny if it happened you know in the game where you smack her.

38:49.460 --> 38:54.220
Oh I thought you meant Travis's woman I was like that's not nice.

38:54.220 --> 38:56.500
Oh you mean the woman in the game?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.500
Yeah in the game.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.500
No okay yeah yeah.

38:58.500 --> 39:01.620
No don't you weren't you there when I played that game the first time and I whacked her

39:01.620 --> 39:04.620
with a shovel and she's like you don't want to do that again and so of course what I do

39:04.620 --> 39:08.060
I whacked her in the face with a shovel again and she took my shovel away and I was fucked

39:08.060 --> 39:09.060
I had to reset the game.

39:09.060 --> 39:13.260
You fucking walk up behind her with a brick and smack her in the back of the head.

39:13.260 --> 39:17.500
Rama says Sky the Viva Pinata cartoon isn't doing too well either.

39:17.500 --> 39:20.620
The cartoon sucks ass I hate that thing.

39:20.620 --> 39:26.100
Anyways so one thing that doesn't suck ass is katamari although what does suck ass is

39:26.100 --> 39:31.100
that the fact that it's not coming to Xbox Live Arcade apparently that was a rumor that

39:31.100 --> 39:39.940
was going around but of course defused by the worldwide Xbox Live Arcade games portfolio

39:39.940 --> 39:47.700
manager Ross Erickson who basically said that the rumor is total crap and is not happening.

39:47.700 --> 39:56.460
So yeah no katamari but I'm sure we'll see katamari come to the 360 some point.

39:56.460 --> 39:57.460
You think?

39:57.460 --> 39:58.460
I think so.

39:58.460 --> 39:59.460
Really?

39:59.460 --> 40:09.300
I don't know yet about what the future has in store for katamari to tell.

40:09.300 --> 40:12.420
There's going to be more katamari games they registered trademarks already for them so

40:12.420 --> 40:20.620
unless they're going to do some fucking katamari cartoon which would be even more cool.

40:20.620 --> 40:25.860
We also have some other interesting rumors going around because the katamari thing started

40:25.860 --> 40:26.860
as a rumor.

40:26.860 --> 40:31.620
Well now they're saying that radiant silver gun 3 there was a report earlier this week

40:31.620 --> 40:37.300
that radiant silver gun 3 was going to be on the Xbox 360.

40:37.300 --> 40:41.820
Also knights is going to be coming to the Wii that would be very interesting knights

40:41.820 --> 40:42.820
coming to the Wii.

40:42.820 --> 40:43.820
Knights on the Wii would be fun.

40:43.820 --> 40:50.220
Of course the radiant silver gun 3 did get basically confirmed not to be happening.

40:50.220 --> 40:54.020
Yep unfortunately there was a follow up a little later in the week where treasure was

40:54.020 --> 40:59.260
giving an interview about what's going on and unfortunately they denied the existence

40:59.260 --> 41:02.020
of radiant silver gun 3.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.940
Go cry a little more about that.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.100
I would like to see radiant silver gun 3.

41:07.100 --> 41:08.660
That's a good shooter.

41:08.660 --> 41:11.100
Knights sounds pretty hot though.

41:11.100 --> 41:17.020
At least we still have ikoruga that we can play if we want to get our fix.

41:17.020 --> 41:19.940
Maybe we can get some virtual console games some old school shooters.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.260
I don't know wishful thinking.

41:21.260 --> 41:24.580
I'm still hunting down radiant silver gun for the Saturn.

41:24.580 --> 41:31.420
Well if you want there's that one game radio allergy which is coming to gamecube and that

41:31.420 --> 41:36.980
one is supposed to be a really good shooter kind of like ikoruga that was coming out this

41:36.980 --> 41:38.780
month but now it's coming out in April I think.

41:38.780 --> 41:41.780
I'm still thinking about getting that dreamcast one that's coming out.

41:41.780 --> 41:43.900
Is it new hope or something?

41:43.900 --> 41:46.940
My dreamcast is in a box sadly.

41:46.940 --> 41:52.900
We used to have ours in an xbox kiosk one of those little demo stations we used to have

41:52.900 --> 41:53.900
our dreamcast sitting in one.

41:53.900 --> 41:57.900
What ever happened to your demo station you had?

41:57.900 --> 41:59.180
How much does those things sell for?

41:59.180 --> 42:01.620
I have no idea what we got for it.

42:01.620 --> 42:02.780
Really what how much lucky?

42:02.780 --> 42:04.860
They're like $500 and not more.

42:04.860 --> 42:07.020
Were you looking at that on ebay or something?

42:07.020 --> 42:09.100
I was for a customer they wanted to bring.

42:09.100 --> 42:14.620
You know those things are so hard to get like for even like microsoft for example in order

42:14.620 --> 42:18.900
to get a kiosk into your store you have to be buying lots of microsoft product and then

42:18.900 --> 42:23.580
you get the privilege of buying one from them for like a couple grand it's like thank you

42:23.580 --> 42:27.860
for giving me the privilege to buy one from you you fucking douche when I'm trying to

42:27.860 --> 42:33.660
push your product you know and you just don't want to give me a kiosk or sell me a kiosk

42:33.660 --> 42:38.180
I don't understand it but whatever.

42:38.180 --> 42:45.220
We do have some news about a new MMO Battlestar Galactica.

42:45.220 --> 42:52.340
It had been reported that it was going to be on Xbox 360 exclusively but Vivendi said

42:52.340 --> 42:59.100
uh uh no they said that they actually have not announced a Battlestar Galactica game

42:59.100 --> 43:07.220
and they cannot comment any more on it so I guess we don't know.

43:07.220 --> 43:09.420
So it's kind of one of those things where it's like it's happening but we're not going

43:09.420 --> 43:11.580
to tell you anything else.

43:11.580 --> 43:15.300
Well they're saying that they might do it there's a rumor at least that there's going

43:15.300 --> 43:21.700
to be a smaller one either for PC or something on Xbox Live Arcade but.

43:21.700 --> 43:26.240
I mean like PC is MMO home though it'll be a little silly to not put it out on the PC

43:26.240 --> 43:30.900
especially you know when the Xbox 360 is a PC according to you know something I read

43:30.900 --> 43:34.460
just before we went live tonight you know according to what Bill Gates the Xbox 360

43:34.460 --> 43:40.380
is a PC so it doesn't seem logical to put out Battlestar Galactica only on the 360 when

43:40.380 --> 43:43.820
you know there's still the PC market to tap into unless they've signed something with

43:43.820 --> 43:48.740
Microsoft and blood you know that there it's an exclusive thing.

43:48.740 --> 43:56.620
Anywho, so we got some street dates for you guys and of course like every week we like

43:56.620 --> 43:59.940
to bring you some exclusive stuff that you may not have heard.

43:59.940 --> 44:03.220
This week I did have a few things on there of course you know being that we put this

44:03.220 --> 44:07.980
show out on Sundays you know some of the stuff has come out during the week two of those

44:07.980 --> 44:11.340
were brand new Ubisoft games whoopee doo.

44:11.340 --> 44:12.340
First one's cause.

44:12.340 --> 44:15.260
Hold on hold on I want to say before you start getting this stuff out we have to get a little

44:15.260 --> 44:19.540
disclaimer about sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong right because you know

44:19.540 --> 44:20.540
that we.

44:20.540 --> 44:21.540
Hey listen.

44:21.540 --> 44:22.540
New year new show.

44:22.540 --> 44:25.260
So sometimes these dates are right sometimes they're wrong why are they wrong sometimes?

44:25.260 --> 44:30.660
They're wrong sometimes because they change dates like daily so stuff changes all the

44:30.660 --> 44:37.780
time and a company to announce a date initially and have that date stick is like a rarity.

44:37.780 --> 44:42.740
This stuff shuffles around and the only reason it shuffles around is development cycles whether

44:42.740 --> 44:49.420
they're in behind or headed in development or getting approval from like Sony Microsoft

44:49.420 --> 44:50.460
and Nintendo.

44:50.460 --> 44:56.380
For instance I just to kind of give an example this week actually I should say a long time

44:56.380 --> 45:00.340
ago I want to say it was in like episode 195 or something it was a while ago a long time

45:00.340 --> 45:06.680
ago about six months ago you said that Bioshock was coming out in April of 2007.

45:06.680 --> 45:10.120
But then this week we heard that there was a 2K games rep that was posting on some forum

45:10.120 --> 45:13.120
that said it's coming out in June you heard it here first.

45:13.120 --> 45:16.060
So it's kind of like you were in the right ballpark but for whatever reason these developments

45:16.060 --> 45:17.060
have got to push out.

45:17.060 --> 45:18.060
No they changed it.

45:18.060 --> 45:23.180
The same day well actually I think because I don't pay attention to some of these date

45:23.180 --> 45:27.220
changes or don't bother repeating them again but like before the guy came out and said

45:27.220 --> 45:32.800
oh yeah by the way this is we had a date change to you know the new new date now.

45:32.800 --> 45:38.180
So I mean it does it it's just a change at all time it's just like trying to think for

45:38.180 --> 45:43.620
example Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the PlayStation 3 first it was going to be a launch title

45:43.620 --> 45:47.740
then it was January and then it was February now it's March.

45:47.740 --> 45:52.500
So it's like you know some games are just push back and push back and push back.

45:52.500 --> 45:57.700
So I mean I try to report them every time I see them change but you know it changes

45:57.700 --> 45:58.700
a lot.

45:58.700 --> 46:02.620
But what I notice you do get from out of this and you've gotten it right every time I can't

46:02.620 --> 46:06.140
think of a time you've ever been wrong on this is when a new title comes in that hasn't

46:06.140 --> 46:10.760
been announced yet like you know about Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 six months before anybody

46:10.760 --> 46:12.140
ever announced it officially.

46:12.140 --> 46:14.300
Whenever these titles drop in there it's always right.

46:14.300 --> 46:15.300
And Oblivion.

46:15.300 --> 46:16.300
That's what I've noticed.

46:16.300 --> 46:17.300
And Oblivion on PSP.

46:17.300 --> 46:18.300
That's right I remember that from last year.

46:18.300 --> 46:21.340
And Full Auto 2 on PSP.

46:21.340 --> 46:24.340
So is there anything in this list that's new that we don't know about yet?

46:24.340 --> 46:25.340
Well yes.

46:25.340 --> 46:26.340
I do know stuff.

46:26.340 --> 46:34.020
Okay first off we mentioned last week driver parallel lines for the PSP which was actually

46:34.020 --> 46:36.580
March 14th was when that was coming out.

46:36.580 --> 46:41.900
Now it's being changed to driver 76 so because if you remember driver parallel lines start

46:41.900 --> 46:45.100
off in 1976 and then it comes in the modern time.

46:45.100 --> 46:49.420
So I'm guessing this game is going to be driver parallel lines but just set in 1976.

46:49.420 --> 46:52.380
I didn't know that because the driver series sucks.

46:52.380 --> 46:53.380
Yeah it does.

46:53.380 --> 46:55.880
But that's just happening.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.340
However though I do have a date for you this will make you happy.

46:58.340 --> 47:02.860
Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 March 14th as well.

47:02.860 --> 47:07.000
And we knew that was coming.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.060
Definitely one that was not a big surprise but we don't have a date for that yet.

47:11.060 --> 47:12.540
So that's kind of cool.

47:12.540 --> 47:14.460
New games though that haven't been announced.

47:14.460 --> 47:19.120
Dream Pinball 3D for the Wii coming out October 10th so still weighs off.

47:19.120 --> 47:22.620
And not a huge surprise but Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is going to be coming

47:22.620 --> 47:27.460
out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii at mandatory movie time.

47:27.460 --> 47:28.620
PS2!

47:28.620 --> 47:29.620
Not 3.

47:29.620 --> 47:30.620
PS2.

47:30.620 --> 47:33.500
Not a lot of stuff being developed for PlayStation 3.

47:33.500 --> 47:36.340
PlayStation 2 though, lots of stuff.

47:36.340 --> 47:37.340
Interesting.

47:37.340 --> 47:42.140
And by the way those two Ubisoft games Cosmic Family and Spelling Spree.

47:42.140 --> 47:46.860
Cosmic Family I hear is meant for really little kids because I guess it's based off a cartoon

47:46.860 --> 47:53.860
series or something like that and then Spelling Spree I'm guessing some sort of DS type of

47:53.860 --> 47:54.860
game.

47:54.860 --> 47:59.140
It makes me think like Imagine People driving by in their cars rolling down the window and

47:59.140 --> 48:01.740
like spelling at them to death.

48:01.740 --> 48:03.700
Oh yeah?

48:03.700 --> 48:06.900
Well PRICE DIE!

48:06.900 --> 48:10.780
Well remember we mentioned last week and I haven't seen this anywhere yet but Driver

48:10.780 --> 48:12.020
Parallel Alliance is on the Wii.

48:12.020 --> 48:14.740
That was one of the ones that they didn't mention.

48:14.740 --> 48:21.740
Not that I really care to play that on the Wii but I'm just saying letting it be known.

48:21.740 --> 48:23.740
So you heard it here first.

48:23.740 --> 48:24.740
Hopefully.

48:24.740 --> 48:25.740
We think.

48:25.740 --> 48:31.820
I can't check the whole internet but as far as I'm aware none of the major sites out there.

48:31.820 --> 48:35.580
The ones backed by magazines and publishing companies.

48:35.580 --> 48:38.420
What about regular release dates for the week?

48:38.420 --> 48:42.560
This week of course January is pretty slow as far as stuff coming out.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.980
Of course the big game this week is going to be Lost Planet which is coming out on the

48:46.980 --> 48:50.900
12th so definitely worth picking up especially if you've played the demo.

48:50.900 --> 48:51.900
Debatable.

48:51.900 --> 48:53.300
I'm not, I'm passing.

48:53.300 --> 48:54.980
I wasn't a fan of the demo sorry.

48:54.980 --> 48:57.980
I'm passing too even though I liked it because I have too many things I'm playing right now

48:57.980 --> 48:59.900
so that's it.

48:59.900 --> 49:02.740
Now PlayStation 2 though not a whole lot coming out.

49:02.740 --> 49:09.800
There's Arthur and the Invisibles woohoo and The Shield which sucked ass and was that based

49:09.800 --> 49:10.800
on the TV show?

49:10.800 --> 49:11.800
Yes.

49:11.800 --> 49:12.800
That's interesting.

49:12.800 --> 49:17.340
So beyond that there's not a whole lot coming out.

49:17.340 --> 49:22.900
I know there's some DS games, new Yu-Gi-Oh game.

49:22.900 --> 49:24.940
It's pretty light.

49:24.940 --> 49:28.980
Japanese release dates you have a couple big titles coming out.

49:28.980 --> 49:33.300
Atsumare Piñata is coming out January 11th 2007 on 360.

49:33.300 --> 49:36.460
That's the name of Viva Piñata localized for Japan.

49:36.460 --> 49:43.660
For the PlayStation 3 you get NBA 07 over there and by the way they have Enchanted Arm

49:43.660 --> 49:47.500
coming out January 25th over in Japan.

49:47.500 --> 49:50.900
Just so you know that's coming up a little sooner but that makes sense.

49:50.900 --> 49:56.800
Actually they call it Enchant Arm EM over in Japan too and that was released long before

49:56.800 --> 49:59.980
it was over here last year on the 360.

49:59.980 --> 50:03.180
GT Pro Series coming out for the Nintendo Wii.

50:03.180 --> 50:05.800
I recommend you pass on that one.

50:05.800 --> 50:09.920
Coming out on January 11th for the PlayStation 2.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.960
Not a lot of new stuff.

50:10.960 --> 50:16.380
You do get a couple things going into the best series from Koei including Warship Gunner

50:16.380 --> 50:21.660
2 and Shin Sangoku Musou 3 Empires and Mushoden.

50:21.660 --> 50:24.820
I should note though that.hack//G.U.

50:24.820 --> 50:29.100
Volume 3 is out next week so I know a lot of folks are really into.hack//.

50:29.100 --> 50:31.500
That's on its way out pretty soon.

50:31.500 --> 50:40.700
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Zettai Onkan Training DS and DS Dengeki Bunko Ira

50:40.700 --> 50:47.380
no Sora UFO No Natsu is coming out this week January 11th and of course...

50:47.380 --> 50:48.380
That's funny.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.380
What?

50:49.380 --> 50:53.060
I guess UFO of Summer?

50:53.060 --> 50:54.060
Well I'm looking here.

50:54.060 --> 50:59.460
I'm looking at the box art and once again it's another freaking DS Japan game that has

50:59.460 --> 51:03.380
funny looking school girls on the cover, all anime style, and it looks like they're flying

51:03.380 --> 51:04.520
a ship.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.100
What was the name of the game?

51:06.100 --> 51:11.740
DS Dengeki Bunko Ira No Sora UFO No Natsu.

51:11.740 --> 51:12.740
Huh.

51:12.740 --> 51:14.420
That's what it's called.

51:14.420 --> 51:15.420
Okay.

51:15.420 --> 51:16.420
Yeah.

51:16.420 --> 51:22.380
But probably most people holding out for, oh never mind it's a US release, never mind.

51:22.380 --> 51:25.540
I have the sky color.

51:25.540 --> 51:26.540
Who cares?

51:26.540 --> 51:27.540
Are any of you really going to import it?

51:27.540 --> 51:28.540
I didn't think so.

51:28.540 --> 51:29.540
I will.

51:29.540 --> 51:33.540
Actually, I'm planning on getting, what was that other game that's not coming out, that

51:33.540 --> 51:35.740
one that we played for DDR?

51:35.740 --> 51:38.180
I'm going to import that.

51:38.180 --> 51:39.180
Which one?

51:39.180 --> 51:40.180
The...

51:40.180 --> 51:41.180
They had the intro.

51:41.180 --> 51:42.180
Oh, Oz.

51:42.180 --> 51:43.180
Yeah.

51:43.180 --> 51:44.180
That's an old game.

51:44.180 --> 51:45.180
I know it's old, but I think I'm going to get it.

51:45.180 --> 51:50.620
Yeah, we played the Oz song, Polyvostian Dance and Chorus, and we played that today and Jamie

51:50.620 --> 51:51.820
was like, I want that game.

51:51.820 --> 51:59.420
Well, reading from that title, I think it's Ira of Sky something, summer, whatever.

51:59.420 --> 52:06.300
Anyway, we have our UK release dates, if anyone's interested, which I am.

52:06.300 --> 52:08.740
On the 12th is pretty much what's coming out.

52:08.740 --> 52:14.100
Bionicle Heroes, Children of Mana, both on DS, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition on Xbox

52:14.100 --> 52:23.780
360, Tokobot Plus Mysteries of the Karakuri on PS2, and Warioware Smooth Moves on Wii.

52:23.780 --> 52:27.860
Yeah, you can't wait for Warioware to come out next...

52:27.860 --> 52:28.860
I think it's...

52:28.860 --> 52:29.860
That's next week, isn't it?

52:29.860 --> 52:30.860
I think it's next week.

52:30.860 --> 52:31.860
Yeah.

52:31.860 --> 52:32.860
Cool.

52:32.860 --> 52:33.860
Yay!

52:33.860 --> 52:34.860
New game.

52:34.860 --> 52:35.860
Finally.

52:35.860 --> 52:36.860
Anyways.

52:36.860 --> 52:37.860
One new game, though, that we're probably not going to see, at least I hope that God

52:37.860 --> 52:44.100
of War, if you're not going to see this, is a new RPG based on Tingle, that really annoying

52:44.100 --> 52:46.420
gay fairy from Wind Waker.

52:46.420 --> 52:49.300
Now he hasn't come out yet, it's just people assuming.

52:49.300 --> 52:55.220
Okay, flaming gay fairy from Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.

52:55.220 --> 52:57.380
Not that there's anything wrong with that, Loki.

52:57.380 --> 53:01.100
Nothing wrong with that, he's just super homo flaming gay.

53:01.100 --> 53:08.060
Anyways, so apparently it's, oh God, it's possibly going to head to the US in 2007.

53:08.060 --> 53:12.420
I was going to say, there is no freaking way this game is not coming to the US at this

53:12.420 --> 53:13.420
point.

53:13.420 --> 53:16.820
If they're going out of their way to put it out in Europe, you know it's coming here.

53:16.820 --> 53:20.020
You know it's going to, because the English version will already exist, it's got to come

53:20.020 --> 53:21.020
here.

53:21.020 --> 53:22.020
What about Mother 3?

53:22.020 --> 53:23.020
Didn't that come out in the...

53:23.020 --> 53:24.060
I don't think it did come out over there.

53:24.060 --> 53:25.660
It came out in Japan, of course.

53:25.660 --> 53:30.020
But I thought there was one game that got translated for the UK but never came out over

53:30.020 --> 53:31.020
here.

53:31.020 --> 53:33.860
That's funny, it's not going to be Tingle RPG, it can't.

53:33.860 --> 53:35.420
That was Mother 3.

53:35.420 --> 53:39.220
Not with the freaking petition going on and everything.

53:39.220 --> 53:42.020
There's people out there that want their tingle.

53:42.020 --> 53:44.100
Tingle.

53:44.100 --> 53:45.420
You know you're going to want this game, Loki.

53:45.420 --> 53:46.420
You're going to buy it.

53:46.420 --> 53:47.420
Nellie's going to make you buy it.

53:47.420 --> 53:48.420
I'm not buying it.

53:48.420 --> 53:49.420
Nellie's going to make you buy it.

53:49.420 --> 53:50.420
She will not make me buy this stuff.

53:50.420 --> 53:53.860
I will show it to her and then she'll make you buy it.

53:53.860 --> 53:55.620
I want to play the Tingle RPG, it'll be fun.

53:55.620 --> 53:57.420
Jamie, will you play the Tingle RPG?

53:57.420 --> 53:58.420
Maybe.

53:58.420 --> 53:59.420
Alright.

53:59.420 --> 54:01.220
When I'm out of school.

54:01.220 --> 54:06.780
Nm64 would like to point out, Loki, Tingle was in Majora's Mask.

54:06.780 --> 54:11.300
JeremyTod1 says, fact, Rob tried to try out for the role of Tingle but Nintendo rejected

54:11.300 --> 54:12.300
him.

54:12.300 --> 54:14.300
Aw, sad.

54:14.300 --> 54:17.460
That is, you know it's true though that I do have this secret desire, I've always wanted

54:17.460 --> 54:19.220
to be a voice actor in a game, I think that would be fun.

54:19.220 --> 54:20.940
That would be a lot of fun, don't you?

54:20.940 --> 54:22.180
A voice actor in a game?

54:22.180 --> 54:23.460
Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?

54:23.460 --> 54:26.740
Well not Tingle, God no, but you know, something.

54:26.740 --> 54:29.700
We could be a soldier that gets shot in Halo 3 or something.

54:29.700 --> 54:32.740
I mean, I don't even know what the hell you'd do in that.

54:32.740 --> 54:33.740
Oh, Tingle!

54:33.740 --> 54:36.500
I'm like, I'll flame that game!

54:36.500 --> 54:40.860
Oh my God, Loki, you should do it!

54:40.860 --> 54:44.140
I'm not going to be Tingle.

54:44.140 --> 54:48.740
I want someone to create a petition right now on that site, whatever that petition site

54:48.740 --> 54:49.740
is.

54:49.740 --> 54:50.740
Loki for Tingle!

54:50.740 --> 54:52.820
Does Tingle have a hag in that game?

54:52.820 --> 54:53.820
I don't know.

54:53.820 --> 54:54.820
I don't remember.

54:54.820 --> 54:58.340
Holy God!

54:58.340 --> 55:03.220
Thank you, insider information says, thank God it's not coming.

55:03.220 --> 55:08.060
Holy Shonen says, Tingle funny, but I want him dead.

55:08.060 --> 55:11.980
I don't think he'd sell well over here, it's too annoying.

55:11.980 --> 55:14.860
People will say, fuck this Tingle shit, we want more Zelda.

55:14.860 --> 55:19.660
Well something else that won't come out over here is new music games for the PSP.

55:19.660 --> 55:20.660
Interesting huh?

55:20.660 --> 55:29.220
Sony is denying that a frequency sequel and a new music game called Traxion for the PSP

55:29.220 --> 55:35.100
were not denied by them, but apparently Harmonix spoke to IGN recently, and the team behind

55:35.100 --> 55:42.100
frequency said, this is what Sony did, Sony denied Traxion and the frequency sequel for

55:42.100 --> 55:43.100
the PSP.

55:43.100 --> 55:47.740
Traxion was killed months ago, months ago that thing was gone.

55:47.740 --> 55:51.100
Harmonix proposed the sequel on the handheld, but Sony said no.

55:51.100 --> 55:55.220
On top of that, LucasArts was going to bring that game Traxion, I'm sorry, it was LucasArts

55:55.220 --> 55:59.460
not Harmonix bringing Traxion, and that was also axed.

55:59.460 --> 56:05.740
I know for a fact, Sony likes to pass on games they should not be passing on.

56:05.740 --> 56:13.200
I'm shocked that they would, with all the fear that Red Octane is causing right now

56:13.200 --> 56:20.820
with Guitar Hero and everything, I'm shocked that they would deny them to make a music

56:20.820 --> 56:21.820
game on the PSP.

56:21.820 --> 56:26.020
Especially when you have frickin' Taiko no Tatujin, which is a stupid game.

56:26.020 --> 56:30.860
I don't understand Sony's logic with the games they're not allowing through, it doesn't make

56:30.860 --> 56:33.300
sense to me at all.

56:33.300 --> 56:38.020
Bad move Sony, because you know, if you do this enough times to Harmonix, and Microsoft

56:38.020 --> 56:41.820
who's going to probably be a little more welcoming, hey you want to develop for us, yeah great,

56:41.820 --> 56:44.580
we want games on the console, you know what, that's where that game's going to end up.

56:44.580 --> 56:49.340
And what about, well I guess Luminous isn't really a music game, I don't know.

56:49.340 --> 56:51.780
But it has happy music.

56:51.780 --> 57:00.020
Well, there is a rumor floating around about another game coming out on Xbox 360 that's,

57:00.020 --> 57:04.020
I think it has a little bit to do with the announcement of Virtua Fighter 5 coming out

57:04.020 --> 57:11.360
on Xbox 360, but the rumor now is for Tekken 6 on Xbox 360.

57:11.360 --> 57:19.260
It was the same person, quote, IG an insider, who was also credited for letting the news

57:19.260 --> 57:26.500
out for Virtua Fighter 5, and so if it's out, I mean, it's not like it hasn't been done

57:26.500 --> 57:29.380
before, you know, that's come out on a non-Sony system.

57:29.380 --> 57:35.060
We've had the Game Boy Advance one, remember Tekken Advance?

57:35.060 --> 57:37.180
I try not to.

57:37.180 --> 57:41.540
I actually own that game, and I thought it was okay.

57:41.540 --> 57:45.580
And then I've got the Blingcast Tekken 3.

57:45.580 --> 57:46.580
So...

57:46.580 --> 57:47.580
Alright.

57:47.580 --> 57:51.700
Are you, what would you think being a Tekken fangirl that you are, what would you think

57:51.700 --> 57:53.740
about this coming to the 360?

57:53.740 --> 57:55.980
Is that good news, bad news?

57:55.980 --> 57:59.560
Because Tekken, I do always kind of put Tekken with Sony.

57:59.560 --> 58:04.380
I mean, you know, because think about Sony's version of Soul Calibur 2 had Heihachi as

58:04.380 --> 58:05.380
the bonus character.

58:05.380 --> 58:07.540
You know, Tekken's always been a very Sony thing.

58:07.540 --> 58:10.940
This, the timing and everything of this seems a little fanboy to me.

58:10.940 --> 58:15.780
I don't think, I think this is just the negative Sony ball keeps on rolling and people are

58:15.780 --> 58:16.780
saying this.

58:16.780 --> 58:17.780
I don't think this is legit.

58:17.780 --> 58:21.300
There was also, though, them saying, you remember Soul Calibur for the longest time was a Sony

58:21.300 --> 58:22.300
exclusive.

58:22.300 --> 58:23.300
Mm-hmm.

58:23.300 --> 58:29.860
Yeah, we had three releases of Soul Calibur, what was it, Soul Calibur 2 on various systems,

58:29.860 --> 58:33.700
each with their own bonus character.

58:33.700 --> 58:36.140
I'm not going to say yea or nay, but I don't think it's far-fetched.

58:36.140 --> 58:37.140
Alright.

58:37.140 --> 58:41.900
Well, it's just there's not a lot, even though, despite what Sony says, oh, we're meeting

58:41.900 --> 58:42.900
our numbers.

58:42.900 --> 58:46.060
I'm like, yeah, they're lower numbers that they keep saying.

58:46.060 --> 58:48.620
The meeting the numbers that they spew out of their ass.

58:48.620 --> 58:52.420
Going back to the previous story for a minute, I just want to say, God, I love the chatters.

58:52.420 --> 58:59.820
Took not even five minutes and look at this, Ipetitions.com slash petition slash Loki Tingle,

58:59.820 --> 59:05.820
all one word, and the petition reads, simply, Loki should be the Tingle in the next Legend

59:05.820 --> 59:06.820
of Zelda game.

59:06.820 --> 59:07.820
Beautiful.

59:07.820 --> 59:08.820
I'm going to sign it right now.

59:08.820 --> 59:12.260
I know, I'm going to go sign it as well while the next story is being read.

59:12.260 --> 59:14.260
Okie dokie.

59:14.260 --> 59:22.300
Anyways, so if you want to get your Tekken fix on the Playstation 3 right now, you can

59:22.300 --> 59:26.660
definitely if you're in Japan, because Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection is out there, but if you're

59:26.660 --> 59:33.180
in another region, fear not, there is a work around just like they have for the Xbox 360

59:33.180 --> 59:34.380
for their demos.

59:34.380 --> 59:36.020
You can actually do this.

59:36.020 --> 59:40.300
First what you need to do on your Playstation 3 is create a new user account for your Playstation

59:40.300 --> 59:41.300
3.

59:41.300 --> 59:44.060
It cannot be an existing new or existing user or sub-user.

59:44.060 --> 59:46.380
It has to be completely from scratch.

59:46.380 --> 59:52.140
Once you've done that, simply enter in all the credit card information and pick the country

59:52.140 --> 59:55.700
as Hong Kong and then choose any city.

59:55.700 --> 01:00:01.880
Once you've done all that stuff, what you do is you add money to your account, but you

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:12.780
have to do it an amount below $50, and that's $50 I believe in Hong Kong dollars, so roughly

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:17.740
add I believe $40 in Hong Kong twice.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:23.840
And once you've done that, I guess that is just under the radar for confirming your address

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.840
or something like that.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:31.140
Once you've done that, you're able to purchase the Tekken Dark Resurrection game from Japan.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:33.900
You better hurry up and do it now because you know Sony is going to close the loophole

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.460
on that within days.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:42.020
So if you really want to do that now or just wait for it to come out, because it will come

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:45.020
out eventually.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:50.400
Speaking of older titles but things that you can download online, Major Nelson published

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.300
this week the top Xbox Live games of 2006, and so since we were talking about downloadable

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:59.700
titles, we'll talk first about the top arcade titles.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:05.700
So let's talk about the top purchased arcade titles according to Major Nelson's list, starting

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:10.020
off with number 20 was Luminous Live, which I thought was kind of low on the list, 19

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:17.180
Cloning Clyde, 18 Small Arms, 17 Feeding Frenzy, 16 Bejeweled 2, 15 Texas Hold'em, 14 Zuma,

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:24.980
13 Contrast, 12 Smash TV, 11 Bankshot Billiards 2, 10 Frogger, 9 Gauntlet, 8 Galaga, 7 Ultimate

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:36.500
Mortal Kombat 3, 6 Doom, 5 Pac-Man, 4 Marble Blast Ultra, 3 Geometry Wars Evolved, 2 Street

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:42.140
Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting, and 1 was Uno, which isn't very surprising.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:50.900
Plus it was one of those ones that had porn and stuff, so not a huge surprise.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:58.700
As far as the top Xbox 360 titles, 20 Splinter Cell Double Agent, 19 Battlefield, 18 Tom

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:05.380
Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, 17 Need for Speed Most Wanted, 16 Dead Rising, 15 Madden NFL

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:10.540
07, 14 Texas Hold'em, 13 Dead or Alive 4, 12 Geometry Wars Evolved, because remember

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:16.940
they are counting everything here, 11 Saints Row, 10 EA Sports Fight Night Round, 3, 9

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:24.500
Uno, 8 Call of Duty 3, 7 Perfect Dark Zero, 6 Project Gotham Racing 3, 5 Oblivion, 4 Ghost

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:31.540
Recon 3, 3 Call of Duty 2, 2 Hexic HD, because it was on all the hard drives, which is surprising

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.660
because they left that off the arcade titles list, and I thought that was an arcade title,

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:36.660
but never mind.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:42.380
And number one, Gears of War, of course, no big surprise there.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:48.460
Alright, well one thing we like to do every week here on Orange Launch Radio is we let

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.980
Dark Sakura have a moment to surf the web up and down, back and forth, and share with

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.260
you all the website that she believes was the best one she found all week long.

01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.180
We call it Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:09.700
Well, my website of the week goes back to my love of digital art, and this is photoshopsupport.com.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:18.420
Tutorials, tools, resources, there's a good link with lots of brushes, lots of good stuff

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:19.420
on it.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:27.500
There's even free stock photos, there's flash resources, Dreamweaver resources, fonts, textures,

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.500
you name it.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.060
That is really, really freaking cool.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:40.780
So I'm going to vote photoshopsupport.com as my website of the week.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:44.780
So surf there right now, one more time Dark Sakura.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:45.780
Photoshopsupport.com.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.060
If you can't spell it, I ain't spelling it out for you.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.060
There you go.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:54.020
Well, one thing that we're not spelling is lawsuit for-

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.020
L-A-W-S-U-I-T lawsuit.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.180
L-A-W-S-U-I-T-T-E-D.

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.180
Is this spelled right?

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:09.820
So yeah, the lawsuit between OverGuitarHero with, of course, guitars, and between Red

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:15.740
Octane, Activision, and the Ant Commandos, well, they've decided to settle.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:22.500
And apparently what's happening now is they're just able to make the guitars, you know, they've

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:28.100
kind of buried the hatchet, I guess, and allowing the Ant Commandos to still make their third

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:33.220
party guitars, and yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:34.620
Everyone's kind of going their own way.

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:39.120
Which makes sense, since, well, you know, Red Octane, they fucking made third party

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.980
guitars for a long time now, I mean, come on, this is like, I don't know, what's-

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:48.760
It sounds to me like they kissed a mate up somehow, one way or another.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.740
Someone blew somebody, I think.

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:58.580
But anyways, yeah, so all that's better now, it doesn't really matter anyways, because

01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.060
if you wanted to wire this guitar, you can always buy the official one, I guess.

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:04.740
Did you see the Guitar Hero 2 360 box art?

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:08.380
No, I didn't get to pull that up at work, I saw that.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.620
I think there's a story coming up on it later in Part B, at least specifically what's

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.660
in the game, so I won't spoil that, but the box art's very interesting because it's

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:18.380
all white, and it's so weird because you're just thinking, you know, you see the Guitar

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.060
Hero boxes, they're black, but of course, this is more the Xbox 360's color scheme,

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.060
so it's kind of interesting.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.820
They just look different to me.

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:29.260
One other thing that looked kind of different to me when I first saw this was the screenshots

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.060
for SimCity on the DS.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:35.760
Some screenshots were recently leaked to the internet from SimCity DS.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.540
What I thought was interesting is that the host of SimCity DS is Will Wright.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.820
Even in the Japanese version, there's this little cartoon character of Will Wright that's

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:45.040
sort of your guide.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:49.320
I think the mayor in the old school SimCity on Super Nintendo, which is a virtual console

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:53.460
game now, Will Wright is kind of performing that role.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:58.540
Now, SimCity DS is not based on the old SimCity, but it looks like it runs on, I think it's

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.460
either the 2000 or the 3000 engine.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:04.780
I think it's SimCity 3, not 2000.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:09.400
It looks a little too in-depth, or they might have enhanced it a little bit, but either

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:15.780
way, it's that more 3D ISO type of view than the old school SimCity was.

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:18.680
I was only really a fan of the first SimCity game.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:24.380
I didn't really get into the series after that, but I know it's a very good simulation

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.780
type game.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:28.700
I would like to see maybe old school Civilization on the DS.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.700
I don't know.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:30.700
Maybe.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:31.700
Maybe that's just me.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.380
Then again, there was old school Civilization, I think, on the Super Nintendo, and it kind

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.380
of blew.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.380
We'll see.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:42.400
Well, as far as other things that remain to be seen, I don't know how much we're going

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:50.700
to agree with this, but Eurogamer posted their top 50 games of 2006, and I've got the top

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.700
10.

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.180
So, if anyone would like to know, I'll read them off.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:56.180
Sure.

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.180
Why not?

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.260
I guess one more best of 06 list to close us out.

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:08.740
Number 10 is Professor Kawashima's Brain Training, How Old Is Your Brain?

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:12.220
Number 9 is Wii Sports.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.220
Wii Sports is good.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.900
Number 8 is Viva Pinata.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.700
I guess I need to actually play that, huh?

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.860
Seven is Gears of War.

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.940
Six is Lego Star Wars II.

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:30.260
Those games are actually pretty fun, but I got really pissed off at the one that came

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:33.700
out a year before.

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:37.940
Five is Dead Rising, because there's something really awesome about running over zombies

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.780
with a lawnmower and cutting their heads off with a scythe.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.500
Four is Final Fantasy XII.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:49.820
Three is The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which Dan and I are currently playing through.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.940
Two is Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:56.500
And the number one game is...

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:57.500
Your mom.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.500
Cooking Mama.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.500
No, Guitar Hero.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:00.500
Really?

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:01.900
Yes, Guitar Hero won number one.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.180
Oh, because that just came out in Europe this year.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.580
Ah, okay, okay.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:06.580
I can see that.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:12.180
And to quote one of the folks from Eurogamer, Keza says, If you don't like Guitar Hero,

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.620
you have no soul.

01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.340
I have to admit, though, I'm getting a little burned out on the guitar hero list.

01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:20.620
I'm a little burned out on it.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:24.860
It's not God's gift to video games like the media is portraying it to be.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.860
It's really not.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:28.200
I love Guitar Hero, but I found out I can't play it drunk.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.580
I feel like I've been playing music games for years, and not to sound elitist or anything,

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:36.740
so I'm sorry if I sound that way, I understand Guitar Hero made the music game genre more

01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.740
accessible.

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:38.740
Don't get me wrong.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.740
And I do think it's a good game.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.820
I think it's a great game, in fact.

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:44.980
But I don't think it's like, you know, oh, sound the chorus of angels.

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.380
Fucking Guitar Freaks 2DX, basically.

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:51.100
I feel like I've kind of seen this before.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.100
What's so freaking great about it?

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.620
But I guess it's just that it made it more accessible through the fact that as much as

01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:03.900
we have loved Konami's Bomani title, they've never really fully been Americanized, if that

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:04.900
makes sense.

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:07.780
Whenever they try to Americanize them, it doesn't always work, because I think they're

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:14.420
letting the Japanese teams Americanize the games, and that doesn't work.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.940
Speaking of top tens, I never posted mine to the site, so I'm going to read it for you

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:18.940
now.

01:09:18.940 --> 01:09:21.100
Would you like to know my top ten games of 2006?

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.100
That's okay.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.100
Well, too bad.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.860
I'm going to tell you anyway.

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.180
I did like Eurogamer's List, though.

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:27.500
You know why I like Eurogamer's List?

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:32.660
Because I like their reviews over there, because, you know, they will tell it like it is over

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.660
there.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.660
So that was interesting to hear that.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:35.660
But now mine.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:40.040
And here's the ones that I thought were the ten best games of 2006.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:43.660
Number ten, I said Sneak King on the 360.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:47.320
And I know you might think I'm crazy, but get this.

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:52.500
It was an original title, the game was four bucks, and it was probably better than most

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.680
of the games that Xbox released in arcade for five or more.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.700
So if you think about it, it's one of the best gaming values of the year, and it absolutely

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.820
deserves recognition.

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.200
I think it came off better than anyone thought it would.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:08.340
So you know, Sneak King, I know it seems weird to put it on a top ten list, but I felt it

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.000
needed some type of recognition for kind of what it did.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.420
It did something really, really original in many ways.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:16.900
Number nine, I said Phantasy Star Universe.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:21.780
And the reason why I said that is because you have massive replayability over previous

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:23.740
versions of Phantasy Star Online in my mind.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.420
You have single player mode, and that would be the type of game that usually you'd think

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:32.260
would be sold by itself, but on top of that you have the online mode, rationed unlocks

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.980
that kind of keep the game going, and makes the world ever expanding, keeps online mode

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.980
fresh.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:41.660
Number eight, I said Kingdom Hearts 2, which I think far too many people overlooked amongst

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:43.140
the 2006 releases.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.660
It was an epic game in every sense of the word, made improvements to the original, kept

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:51.980
a fresh storyline, and even if you consider that some of the old worlds from the first

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.660
game return, I mean, they kept it fresh.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.660
It's amazing.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:59.660
Yes, it has a three hour opening, but the fact that it's got like the year's probably

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:04.540
one of the best soundtracks of the year, amazing visuals, and fucking Tron World.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.540
Enough said.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:06.540
Tron World.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:07.920
One of the best games of the year.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.300
Number seven, I said Trauma Center Second Opinion, because you know, this is proof that

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.260
games do not have to have great graphics to be fun.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:19.740
It was originally hailed as truly original on the DS, and it really feels like on the

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:24.100
Wii, this is how the game always should have been, and it's probably the most grossly

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.020
underlooked and underrated Wii launch title.

01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.420
It definitely deserved a place in the top ten of the year.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:31.380
Number six, I said New Super Mario Brothers on the DS.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.500
Nintendo certainly knows how to milk its retro franchises for all they are worth, but New

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:39.360
Super Mario Brothers takes this old formula, gives it a kick in the pants.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.100
This is the game people wanted on the GameCube.

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.100
Everybody wanted to see a game like this on the GameCube, and for whatever reason Nintendo

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.900
said, now we'll put it on the DS.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:53.540
And it's like, people read our minds and they got it when, you know, we say that the next

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:57.140
generation of gaming, you don't have to make everything in 3D.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:01.420
You can make visually appealing 2D games, and New Super Mario Brothers was it.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:05.380
So definitely it was one of the best titles of the year.

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:09.940
Number five, I said Dead Rising on the 360, because it's an absolutely original concept

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.100
for a game that just feels fun.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:16.020
You're running over zombies with a lawnmower, for God's sake.

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.380
The greatest thing about the game to me is that you just kind of pick it up and have

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.580
fun with it, and just like any sandbox type game, you can just say screw it to the stories

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.300
and go decapitate zombies, and it's awesome.

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.300
Number four would be Final Fantasy XII.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:32.840
The game is not aging at all, it's reinventing itself as many times as Madonna has, having

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.140
a fresh story, and the battle system is phenomenal.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:41.300
It feels simple in the game's first hours, but as you play more, it gets so engaging,

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.580
and it's great.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:48.260
16.99 widescreen support in the US helps the game kind of keep up with the next gen of

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.260
gaming.

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:53.460
Unfortunately, I think it was maybe released a little too late for enough people to notice

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:58.940
this title, but it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy roleplaying games at all.

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:02.040
Number three, I said Elite Beat Agents on the DS.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.580
It's probably, honestly, one of the best music video games of all time, period.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:10.020
There's no fancy controller that you have to embarrass yourself with, you just pick

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:14.740
up the pen and you go, hilarious cutscenes, diverse soundtrack, it's an awesome game,

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:17.260
and it's better than Oh and Don, sorry.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:21.380
Number two, I said Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, simply the good graphics.

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.860
You go anywhere you want in a huge world, it's so big it's overwhelming, it's phenomenal,

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:30.360
and then you have all these downloadable expansions to it that just keep the game freaking going

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.060
and going and going.

01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:33.060
It's an incredible achievement.

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:36.580
And then, of course, as I said last week, number one would be The Legend of Zelda Twilight

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.540
Princess.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:42.980
Just the fact that you've got the new Wii controls on it, you have these clever new

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:47.100
items added to the Zelda universe to kind of make use of that, and the story elements

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.100
and everything.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.420
It's just a phenomenal title that was well worth the wait.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.420
There you have it.

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.140
Those are my top ten of the year.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.420
Anyone else want to expand on what they thought were the best games of the year?

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:01.540
I have my top ten list in your email, but I don't know what it was off the top of my

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.540
head.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540
Let me know what you want real quick.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.540
Jamie, anything you want to add?

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.540
Cookie Mama!

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:13.420
Loki, I'll read them off and you can explain your picks if you want.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:16.300
Well, you should read off what I put on there because it was funny.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.300
Fine, hold on.

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:18.300
Let's see, what do we got?

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.300
I have...

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.860
Okay, here we go.

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.220
Loki picked Final Fantasy XII.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.620
This is the number ten best game of the year.

01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.860
I'm sure somewhere in the video game top list guidelines it says we are required to put

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:30.260
at least one Final Fantasy game in any top ten list.

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.820
So this year it's Final Fantasy XII.

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.940
It's sexy, new, and everyone wants to be it.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.300
It'll be its friends.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:39.540
That is until Final Fantasy XIII comes out, all fifty different versions of it.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.380
Loki said number nine was Dead Rising.

01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:44.380
Dawn of the Dead, the game, I mean Dead Rising was pretty awesome.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.640
Although I wish the save system wasn't thought up by brainless zombies.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.780
Loki said the number eight game of 2006 was Call of Duty 3.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.980
Call of Duty 2 was an incredible game and this one only improves on the formula even

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.720
better if you have surround sound.

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.180
Loki said the number seven game of the year was New Super Mario Bros.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.460
I think these are in no particular order also.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.460
Oh really?

01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:05.460
It's just my top ten.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:06.460
Oh, well too bad.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.540
I'm assuming this is the order.

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:11.180
I didn't realize Super Mario Bros. 3 and a half could be so much fun.

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.700
I guess you can't beat the old 2D platformer days.

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.660
I just hope we get some more like this on every system.

01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:21.900
Number six was Gears of War, the killer app before Halo 3, a very intense and albeit hard

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.900
game.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.180
Number five was Twilight Princess.

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:25.740
We've waited so long for New Zelda.

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.700
It's everything we could have wanted.

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.940
Number four was Excite Truck.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.780
I guess that's why you said this is in no order.

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:37.020
Who in their right mind would put Excite Truck above Twilight Princess, you idiot?

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.020
Me?

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.460
Okay, now read.

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:43.920
It looks like Nintendo's BEA to the punch for a burnout off-road, a great launch game

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.620
for the Wii that converted at least two non-gamers, my wife and extrovert, into full-fledged gamers.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:51.460
All right, that's a good point, good point.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.520
Number three, Saints Row.

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.660
It's like Grand Theft Auto three and a half.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:59.820
I spent countless lunches hurling grenades and rockets at cops while speeding away on

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:00.980
my riced-out minifan.

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:05.260
I'll be playing this game until Saints Row 2 comes out or Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.020
According to Loki, the number two best game of the year was Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:12.620
I have to give props to a game that would let me rob a guild bear, punch a deer, and

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:16.740
set fire to civilians in the course of one day and wearing nothing but a loincloth.

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:19.420
Well said, well said.

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:23.640
And the number one game according to Loki in 2006, and I totally disagree, Grand Theft

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.860
Auto Vice City Stories.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.420
Despite its incredibly flawed targeting system and rather frustrating glitches, Grand Theft

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.860
Auto Vice City Stories is the most fun you'll ever have on the PSP ad hoc multiplayer.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:37.820
I can only hope that GTA IV is up to this level of fun just for the love of God beta

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:41.260
the multiplayer more than five minutes, and I think exactly for those reasons that the

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:45.060
fact that it had some bad beta-ing, you should not have put that game anywhere near your

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.060
top ten.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.340
It was in no particular order, that's why I put it there, so whatever.

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.600
All right, there you go.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.700
And then NM64 says, Loki admitted his wife's a gamer.

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:57.420
JV Mon says, Rob, I would put Excite Trek before Zelda.

01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.340
I don't know, you guys, it's a good game.

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:05.380
I think Excite Trek is horribly underrated, and it probably would be in my top fifteen,

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.180
but the worst part about Excite Trek is that it was too short.

01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:10.180
That's it.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.380
That was the worst part about it.

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.740
All right, Jamie has a list she'd like to share.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:19.940
Okay, my number ten is actually DDR Supernova, just because it's bringing DDR back to the

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:24.340
arcade, giving everybody what they want, and I think that's a good thing, it's sort of

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:27.500
help rebuilding the whole community, and that makes me happy.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.580
And nine is the Super Mario Brothers, just because it's Super Mario Brothers, and that

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.660
game's actually kind of hard.

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:38.380
Eight is the Resistance Fall of Man, because it's pretty, and you explode heads and stuff.

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:42.220
And I actually like Guitar Hero 2, so it's on there for my number seven.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:46.000
And number six is Trauma Center, because that game's fucking frustrating and evil and has

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.220
people screaming loudly at their DS's.

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:56.020
And then five is Wii Sports, because it's actually kind of fun.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.380
Four would be Zelda.

01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:00.060
Three is Pirates of the Caribbean Pinball.

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:01.620
What?

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.020
Okay.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:06.820
You really thought outside the box for your picks.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.860
Well, you are a pinball whore, I'll take it.

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.380
No, I'm married to a pinball whore, that's a different story.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.380
I understand, I understand.

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:16.580
Two is going to be all the Flash games on the Doctor Who website.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.740
Oh my god, you loser.

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:21.460
Your list just lost all credibility.

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.460
Hey!

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.940
I like the game where he's the drawing and you have to walk through the thing.

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:28.940
Failed.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:29.940
Clank.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.500
And one is Cooking Mama, of course.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.320
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:39.700
You're the only gamer girl I can think of that would put Cooking Mama at the top of

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.600
her list with pride.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.600
Very well done.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.600
It's great!

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.200
Cooking Mama is awesome!

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.980
Next year, her number one game will be Driving Training.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:49.980
What?

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.260
Because you know, you're a woman.

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.260
This is good radio.

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:58.380
Unless you can't see me flip you off.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:02.900
And on that note, we should probably go to break while Dark Sakura kicks my ass out in

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.220
the parking lot.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:11.300
So we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio Part B.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:16.020
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.020
a week.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:21.300
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
