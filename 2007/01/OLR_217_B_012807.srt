00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,060
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,860
We are here on this lovely Sunday evening, January 28, 2007 for more of Orange Lounge

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,860
Radio.

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,480
We're going to get into Part B. My throat is feeling a little bit better, but I'm going

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,000
to step out of the room for just a second to get some coffee out of my Hello Kitty coffee

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
maker.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,920
For those who didn't listen to Part A, my throat is kind of bad tonight.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,560
So I'm going to go get some more hot stuff to drink.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,520
And can you guys take care of some gaming news for a minute?

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Why not?

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
I would really appreciate that.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
All right.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,840
Anyways, so starting things off, this week Microsoft had announced their earnings for

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
their quarter.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,600
And of course, the profits were down, but at least the 360 revenues were up.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
Well, unfortunately Microsoft went back and revised their earnings statements, basically

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,780
saying that their expected 360 shipments for 2007 and spring, they reduced it down from

18
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,120
$13 million, $15 million to $12 million.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,600
This is due to unsold inventories in stores.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,500
So basically, you know that big tower of 360s that you see in your Best Buys and your Game

21
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Stops.

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,980
Well, because of that, they are dropping their shipments amount because who needs to ship

23
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,240
more units if there's tons in the stores.

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Anyways, and because of that, all these stocks from other companies have dropped a little

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,200
bit as well because of that news.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,000
So it's not a big surprise.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,560
I mean, the PlayStation 3 is kind of in the same boat right now where they have a ton

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,120
of units in stores and no one's really buying them because there's not a lot of games out

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,720
right now or it's too expensive.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,440
Either way, one of the analysts, PJ McNeely, said, video game publishers will be under

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,580
pressure today after Microsoft cuts its life-to-date shipment.

32
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,120
There is investor concern about reset of expectations around both the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation

33
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
3.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,840
So, pretty much, I guess they're playing it safe.

35
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
I missed all that.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Could you repeat it?

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
No.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,920
It's basically Microsoft shipping or they're reducing their amount of shipments that they're

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
going to be...

40
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,380
No, I heard Microsoft's goal went down a little bit and I can see the impact that's having

41
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,800
on things as a whole.

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
It's only down to being a few million, I guess.

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
That's kind of bad, but they just have to sell the units that they have right now and

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,240
trust me, those units will be gone once Halo 3 comes out.

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Even maybe Crackdown.

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
I mean, Crackdown might sell a few.

47
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,440
I don't know about selling units for beta, but it couldn't hurt, I guess.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,040
This is a report coming from QJ.net speaking of the Xbox 360.

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
This is a little bit of a hack.

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,040
You can use this at your own risk, but apparently, a hack has been released, the HDD Hacker,

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,360
that will allow you to use your own hard drive with the Xbox 360.

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Now, keep in mind there are some limitations.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:20,400
You can only really use a Western Digital BEVS series and only a 20 gigabyte hard drive,

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,600
but keep in mind if you do it that way, a 20 gigabyte hard drive through Western Digital

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:32,120
is going to be a hell of a lot cheaper than a regular Xbox 360 hard drive through Microsoft.

56
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,180
The site goes on to say that once bigger Microsoft certified hard drives come out, then you'll

57
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,640
be able to use those with the tool, but I'm thinking, no, you won't.

58
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,360
Microsoft is very good about patching this shit as soon as they find it, and I bet you

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,240
by this time next week, we'll see a patch roll out on live that will prevent this.

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,640
The next patch that goes out on live will shut this thing out.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
No, I don't think so.

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Why is that?

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,200
The reason why this does is actually there's information on the hard drive sector that's

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,640
the same on all the hard drives because they have to be universal since they're working

65
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
with all these different systems.

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,480
It's basically some sort of identified device type of thing that's stored in one sector

67
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,560
so all they do is basically mimic that on this hard drive so all it thinks is that it's

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,240
a legit hard drive so there would be no way to patch this because it's a peripheral.

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,720
It would be like if I took a controller for the 360 and I made it look like that's an

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
official Microsoft controller.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,160
There's no way for it to tell between whether this is real or not.

72
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,240
You follow the hack stuff more than I do so I'll take your word for it, but this just

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,280
seems like the kind of thing that Microsoft's usually all over, but I'll take your word

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
for it.

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
It's not like modifying firmware or anything like that so I think that they wouldn't be

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,000
able to patch this.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,920
We'll see what happens.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:05:00,200
Going into things that have not quite yet having to do with the Xbox 360, let me just

79
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,480
rephrase this.

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,720
You're all familiar with the Unreal Engine, right?

81
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Sure.

82
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
There's been some good games coming out of that.

83
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,840
Well guess who's just licensed it?

84
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,360
It's been licensed by Squeenix.

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
Really?

86
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Yep.

87
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:32,440
There's basically a statement put out by the general manager of R&D at Square Enix that's

88
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,560
Taku Murata, saying that it will speed up the creation process and allow developers

89
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,200
to spend less time working on the technology.

90
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,240
To quote, the complexity of next generation game systems featuring HD graphics and multi-core

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,160
parallel processing poses a number of technological challenges to our game development, however

92
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,360
we can expedite our game development process significantly while allowing extra time and

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,480
resources to be spent on game design and mechanics.

94
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,600
So does this mean we're going to be killing slimes in 3D, as somebody in chat said?

95
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Maybe.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I like this thought.

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,040
DrewNami says, Kingdom Hearts 3 using the Unreal Engine.

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,360
Wouldn't that be hot?

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,400
I have a boner just thinking about it.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Just kidding, just kidding.

101
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,280
But still, that's pretty exciting.

102
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
The Unreal Engine's pretty good.

103
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,320
There's actually a little bit more information regarding the Unreal Tournament itself.

104
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Unreal Tournament 2007 is now renamed as Unreal Tournament 3 and is going to be on Xbox 360.

105
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,760
It was confirmed at Midway's Gamers' Day in Las Vegas.

106
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,440
It's going to be developed with the PC and PS3 versions.

107
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,920
It has release later on this year.

108
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
I don't know.

109
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,740
It's Unreal.

110
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,280
You know one thing I do like about Unreal?

111
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,560
I haven't played a whole lot of it, but one thing I did play it on the original Xbox because

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,360
I bought it when it was like 20 bucks.

113
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,360
It's fucking fast.

114
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,040
It is like one of the fastest shooters I've ever played.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
It's amazingly fast.

116
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
I like it.

117
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,720
Even just the first Unreal Tournament was crazy.

118
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,840
That was a game that gave me some freaking motion sickness right there.

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Yeah, I was going to say, you probably are not having much fun with those games with

120
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,280
how fast they move.

121
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,160
There's also a little bit more as far as, not necessarily just the graphics, but different

122
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
multiplayer modes.

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,480
There is a voice-controlled AI and player-controlled vehicles.

124
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,160
There's also a conquest mode that will be a battle for eight teams on a map that's three

125
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,360
times the size of the deathmatch and onslaught maps.

126
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,200
Speaking about Square Enix here, NCSX has reported that Square Enix is going to be producing

127
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:50,120
a collection of replica weapons called the Square Enix Master Arms Collection.

128
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,840
It's basically going to be some of the weapons from the Final Fantasy series and Keyblade

129
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,320
from Kingdom Hearts.

130
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,480
Unfortunately, they are not going to be full-sized, so don't get your hopes up there, but they're

131
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:09,080
going to range from 15 centimeters for, like, Cerberus to 26 centimeters for Sephora's

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
Gunblade.

133
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,240
So, right now there's four different blades to choose from.

134
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,920
Let's see, Cerberus, which I believe, I can't remember which Final Fantasy that was from.

135
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:32,040
The Keyblade, of course, from Kingdom Hearts, Squall's Gunblade, from eight, and Sephora's

136
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,160
Gunblade from eight as well.

137
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
But they look kind of cool.

138
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,000
Of course, though, the prices aren't too expensive right now, only, well, they're $39 for each

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
one.

140
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Awesome.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,400
I just wish they had full-sized ones, of course, then people might kill each other and who

142
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
would want that?

143
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Yeah, that would hurt.

144
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,960
This sounds like something you'd have in your house, Dark Sakura.

145
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Maybe.

146
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
I have school to pay for.

147
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Alright.

148
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,400
Well, speaking about Square Enix, you know, of course, Final Fantasy is a big game that's

149
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,940
going to be coming out on PlayStation 3, and, you know, when PlayStation 3 came out, a lot

150
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,580
of folks were using Final Fantasy XII, a PlayStation 2 game, on their PlayStation 3.

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,560
But there were some problems, and that would be the way the game looked, because they looked

152
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
uglier.

153
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Remember, we talked about this on the show a while back.

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
Yeah.

155
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
There was a YouTube video that showed, like, the side-by-side comparisons.

156
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,760
Well, guess what?

157
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,680
There's an upcoming firmware update that is going to include a patch that we fixed.

158
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
It's already up.

159
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh, did it already go up?

160
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
It already went up.

161
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
I don't have a PlayStation 3, so I don't know.

162
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Yeah.

163
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,800
But apparently it went up, and they did this whole little change there, is that the PlayStation

164
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,720
1 and 2 games now will run right, and they'll look fine.

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,480
And now you can also, they also did some other little things, like you can set an image photo

166
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,080
for a user ID, and da-da-da, all this other little minor crap, Korean keyboards and stuff

167
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
you can use now.

168
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,280
You know, it's weird though, and you know on your PSP how during the months it'll change

169
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,560
colors in the background?

170
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,400
Well, the PS3 backgrounds will slowly fade from one color to another as time goes on

171
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
through the month.

172
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,800
It might start off black, and now it's yellow.

173
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,440
It's kind of weird.

174
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,600
Ew, yellow?

175
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Yeah.

176
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
Not my favorite color.

177
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:22,280
Well, I actually know yellow is associated with aggression, so it's not my favorite either.

178
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,920
But there's actually though a little bit more news coming out regarding an animated Castlevania

179
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,880
3 movie, or yeah, the Dracula's Curse movie.

180
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,880
They're basically looking, they're still in the early stages of their production.

181
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,040
They're working on the visual development side of everything.

182
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,040
So it's through February, it's going to be mostly character creature design.

183
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,800
They need background designers, background painters.

184
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,600
They're actually looking for artists to work with that, so they actually have opened up

185
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,640
positions in Southern California.

186
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,400
If you actually want to submit your portfolio to them, you can actually email Belmont at

187
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,920
Castlevania Dracula's Curse dot com.

188
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,320
I think that's pretty cool.

189
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
They're looking for artists.

190
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Give us some work.

191
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,040
I like to see that when it comes out.

192
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,660
Well, unfortunately, there have been some other bad vampire movies, including Blood

193
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,120
Rain, which is up for six Razzies.

194
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,240
It's received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst

195
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,820
Supporting Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay.

196
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:47,600
So that's, I guess, good news if you really hate Blood Rain.

197
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,640
Although if you do hate Blood Rain, you would probably be disappointed to know that he's

198
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,020
playing a sequel, and it's, I think, already in production, so that kind of sucks.

199
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,000
One other movie that he has coming out, though, pretty soon is going to be Postal, and IGN

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,280
had some news from that, actually, talking about some of the things that are going to

201
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,760
be offending people, including such wonderful things as full frontal nudity from news radios

202
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Dave Foley.

203
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,440
Apparently, he's going to be playing some crazy cult leader.

204
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,320
And there's one scene...

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Hooray.

206
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,120
I mean, I realize you guys know I'm gay and all, but I'm not thrilled to hear about that.

207
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,480
I mean, he's kind of old.

208
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,600
Anyways, Dave Foley's character in the production is called Uncle Dave, and is a twisted cult

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,080
leader who uses his religious doctrine to keep his subjects in a constant state of servitude,

210
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:45,000
and he exploits this by luring them into orgies at their debauchery, and says in the scenes

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,680
that they saw, Foley was dressed in an open robe, and they mean open, wandering around

212
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,400
the room, barking orders, and at the end of the scene, he takes a crap on camera.

213
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,840
Yeah, that's the kind of movie...

214
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
What?!

215
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,760
The other fun stuff about this movie, though...

216
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,400
Oh my God, talk about your career going downhill after, you know, news radio going off the

217
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,000
field, that's got to be made up.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,240
Other stuff that they have in the movie, it says there's stuff about 9-11, they actually

219
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,680
make fun of 9-11, they make fun of school shootings, including, I guess there was one

220
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,020
scene that says an ultra-violent shocking image of an overhead shot of bloody children

221
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:33,680
laying in a schoolyard, and apparently, Bin Laden's one of the main characters in this,

222
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
so...

223
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,440
This sounds like the dumbest fucking thing in the world, I mean seriously, I mean there's

224
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,220
a difference between, like, you know, parody that's somewhat amusing, and this just sounds

225
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,000
like stupid after stupid after stupid.

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,560
Yeah, so, it should be interesting, I guess.

227
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,040
Okay, interesting's a good word to define, I suppose.

228
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
I'll see it, though.

229
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,400
I will definitely go see it.

230
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Oh, God.

231
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Have fun.

232
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
By yourself.

233
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,360
Unless you can talk Nellie into going.

234
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,800
All right, well, one thing we didn't go over in part A were the release dates, even though

235
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,240
Loki gave us some exclusives, we didn't talk about what's coming out this week, so I want

236
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,280
to start it off talking about Japanese release dates, of which, honestly, folks, there's

237
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,880
not a whole lot.

238
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,180
January was a dry month for us over here in the US, and February, at least the beginning

239
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,000
part of it, looks to be a bit slow over there in Japan.

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,640
We do have J-League Pro Soccer Club Otsukoru 5 coming out on February 1st.

241
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:40,320
So zero shikikan josentai ni, which is best hits from Taito, and I'm not sure if that's

242
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,780
a game that's actually out over here, looks like some type of old school B-52 type bomber

243
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,780
game.

244
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,320
I don't think this is a game they have over here.

245
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,440
Twin Cobra?

246
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,600
I don't think so.

247
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't remember.

248
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
What's the word at the time?

249
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,720
Shikikan josentai ni.

250
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,880
Ah, whatever.

251
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,120
It's just the best hits anyway.

252
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
It's already out.

253
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
It's just going in to be a little bit cheaper, and let's see, what do we have over on the

254
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,400
Nintendo DS?

255
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,040
We do have a couple things coming out on the DS.

256
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,440
We have Monster House, which I suppose is a release a lot of folks are looking forward

257
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:25,420
to, as well as Bokujo Monogatari Kimi to Sodatsu Shima coming out for Marvelous Entertainment

258
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,920
as well over there in Japan.

259
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,360
And that's really about all there is to note.

260
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,720
Oh, I'm sorry, there actually is an Ys game coming out on the Sony PSP.

261
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,520
I guess that's certainly notable.

262
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,980
I love Ys.

263
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,320
The game is called Nappishitom no Hako, and it has a special edition coming out on February

264
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
1st.

265
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Ooh.

266
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,600
Well, for our UK release dates, in February we have coming out on the first Warpath for

267
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
PC.

268
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,720
On the second, we have Arthur and the Invisibles for PS2, DS, PC, Game Boy Advance, Contact

269
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:08,080
on DS, also Dungeon Siege Throne of Agony on PSP, Europa Universalis III on PC, Ghost

270
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,200
Rider on Xbox, NFL Street 3 going to be on PSP and PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis Collection

271
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,440
on PS2, PSP, and on the fifth, Galactic Civilizations 2, but that's coming out later.

272
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Anyways, for the US, there's a couple of few good things coming out this week.

273
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,000
The big one, of course, being Rogue Galaxy on PlayStation 2.

274
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,160
Brand new RPG by Level 5, you may remember Dragon Quest VIII.

275
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Awesome game.

276
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,760
Reviewed pretty good from what I've seen.

277
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,800
Civil Stations Midway is coming on PC and Xbox 360, a pretty good World War II kind

278
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,400
of aerial and naval combat game.

279
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:56,440
On the PC, Vanguard Saga of Heroes, and let's see here, Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation

280
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:09,740
3, Fusion Frenzy 2 on Xbox 360, City Life World Edition on the PC, and Monopoly Here

281
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,880
and Now on the PC.

282
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,760
That's about it for this week, at least.

283
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,080
All right, well, I wanted to mention this, and this is a little bit embarrassing because

284
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
the...

285
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Oh, no, there it is.

286
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Good, we got it.

287
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
The link wasn't working previously.

288
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,680
For some reason, I was trying to hit Blizzard Entertainment to look at this press release

289
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,160
that talks about World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade.

290
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,760
Of course, you know that that game just came out earlier this month.

291
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,960
Well, get this.

292
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,000
It sold 2.4 million copies in the first 24 hours.

293
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,600
It was released simultaneously in North America, Europe, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia,

294
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,080
and then January 17th, Australia and New Zealand just the day after, which actually would,

295
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,360
because they're on the other side of the day line, but never mind.

296
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,280
Regardless, it came out, it sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours.

297
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,420
That's pretty impressive and certainly shattered any existing PC game records that were already

298
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
out there.

299
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,400
So, lots of World of Warcraft addicts out there in the world, apparently.

300
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
People that were buying two or three for their families.

301
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Are they ignoring their babies?

302
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
I don't know.

303
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,960
For those that only listen to us during the podcast, we have a bonus segment we do here

304
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,240
live that only live listeners, whether it be on All Games or Orange Wells Radio can

305
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
listen to.

306
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,800
Tonight, we spent like 30 minutes talking about World of Warcraft addiction, thanks

307
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,120
to a Tyra Banks show clip.

308
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,200
So that's what Jamie's making reference to.

309
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Interesting.

310
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,560
Let me read a quick quote here from the co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment, Mike Morhaime.

311
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,720
The Burning Crusade has already exceeded even our most ambitious expectations.

312
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,280
We're pleased that so many players are eager to see all of the new content that the expansion

313
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,040
has to offer, and we look forward to seeing everyone online as additional players continue

314
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,720
to upgrade in the days ahead.

315
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,240
I still have not bought the expansion.

316
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,040
I won't be buying it until I hit level 40.

317
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,320
That's what I promised myself.

318
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,720
Well, there are, I think, other MMOs that might be pulling people's addiction.

319
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,000
There's a Lord of the Rings MMO actually has a date.

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,760
It will be launching, it's a Lord of the Rings Shadow of Angmar to be released in Europe

321
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,080
on the 24th of April, according to Codemasters.

322
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,100
The price of it actually is going to be a special pre-order rate for $99.99 that has

323
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,160
a lifetime membership instead of a subscription fee.

324
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:38,800
So you can either do that or pay £5.99 a month for a six month package.

325
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:45,520
But the advantage of pre-ordering it gives you early access to the game for ten days.

326
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,560
You can use a pre-launch character in the full game, so basically whatever you make

327
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,240
during this little beta is yours to hold onto.

328
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,120
You get a unique in-game bonus item, six Lord of the Rings online stickers, and a special

329
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,120
window sticker.

330
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,880
It seems kind of interesting.

331
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,600
I don't know, there's so many MMOs out there really.

332
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Well, I'm reading some comments from chat on the previous MMO story we talked about.

333
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Joshi16 says, Blizzard rep translation.

334
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Money money money money, which is kind of true.

335
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,520
DrewNami our resident World of Warcraft addict says, I'm a rogue, I do it from behind.

336
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
Is that like on a t-shirt or something?

337
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Yeah, that's disgusting.

338
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,720
And Brad from PodCulture says, I'm waiting for the Firefly MMO.

339
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Amen!

340
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:45,760
Also, though, just to let you know, I'm on the US site for this Lord of the Rings game.

341
00:20:45,760 --> 00:21:00,800
For the pre-order special that they're having on that one, when you pre-order it, you have

342
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,960
$199 for the lifetime thing, or $9.99 monthly.

343
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,440
Early access, you keep your launch care, it's the same thing really.

344
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,760
You get an enchanted cloak of regeneration and a ring of agility.

345
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:20,000
I had to read some of these other interesting comments.

346
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
SSJ100Matt says, dear Blizzard, since you have all this money, you wouldn't mind putting

347
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,760
Starcraft on DS, would you?

348
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,360
And Michael Doi is going to make a fan with Jamie here saying, I want a Doctor Who MMO.

349
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,880
Hell yeah!

350
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I saw that coming.

351
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,280
I might send it for the beta for this, though.

352
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,320
Anyways, so before Doctor Who MMO, you're going to see something else coming from BBC.

353
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,560
That would be CBBC, their kid's property.

354
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,880
They're going to be creating an MMO based on that called CBBC World.

355
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:58,720
It's going to be aimed at kids ages 7 to 12, and it's going to kind of just be your online

356
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,840
MMO for kids, just like Toontown Disney thing over here.

357
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:14,360
It's going to have a bunch of custom avatars, minigames, music videos, completely lame for

358
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,080
anybody over the age of 12, but Jamie will still be signed up to play.

359
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,760
No, it's going to be like Gaia Online or something, which I quit in a day because it was boring.

360
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,500
You'll still play it because if it's BBC related, it might remotely have a Doctor Who

361
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,040
reference in it, and you'll be like...

362
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,280
If someone tells me for sure there's a Doctor Who reference, I'll sign up.

363
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,160
It'll be funny.

364
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,480
I only want our UK listeners to tell me.

365
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Alright, fine.

366
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,560
I was going to say, in a completely unrelated note that doesn't even have to do with video

367
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,320
games, but I think it's kind of funny regarding the BBC, I read on some reality TV news site.

368
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,520
Don't ask me what I was doing reading it, but I was, that the BBC is doing a Harry Potter

369
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
reality show.

370
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,320
It's not called Harry Potter, but they're sending kids to Magic School, and it's going

371
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,840
to be like a reality show for kids in Magic School, and they actually have to do magic

372
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
tricks.

373
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Do you mean Devil School?

374
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
No, it's Magic School.

375
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
You mean Devil School?

376
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Yeah, I get it.

377
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
I get it.

378
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
I see what you did there.

379
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
But no, it sounds really cheesy.

380
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,800
But I hope they bring the show over to America, because it would be a hoot.

381
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Magic School.

382
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,680
Because they get a lot of shows from Britain over here, and it should be hosted by David

383
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,800
Copperfield, because he's washed up anyway.

384
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,440
What the hell ever happened to David Copperfield?

385
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
He just disappeared.

386
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,840
He just made himself disappear.

387
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,440
Well, one game that disappeared but made a hell of a comeback, moving into some non-MMO

388
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,200
PC gaming news, Sam and Max.

389
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,520
They were gone for a long, long time, and then they came back.

390
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,480
They're getting new life thanks to GameTap and some of the other distribution methods

391
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,760
they're doing.

392
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,320
Episode one, Culture Shock for Sam and Max, came out in October of 2006.

393
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,960
Episode two came out December of 2006, and now episode three just came out on GameTap

394
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
just this past week.

395
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,480
It's titled The Mole, The Mob, and The Meatball.

396
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,840
It's going to be the third part of a six-part series.

397
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,080
From what I understand, I have yet to play these games myself.

398
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
I really need to.

399
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I have a GameTap subscription.

400
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,720
I need to put down the wow and get into these games.

401
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,560
From what I understand, none of these episodes are really long.

402
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,760
Maybe you'll play them for four hours, depending on how much you play.

403
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,400
If you have to explore, if you look at Cranny or not.

404
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,160
It sounds kind of interesting.

405
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,480
You often hear about these episodic gaming, but they kind of produce one or two episodes

406
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
and then that's it.

407
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,200
It's kind of nice to see Sam and Max keep going at it and being very successful.

408
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,520
I've heard nothing but raves about the game, so I promise you I will play Sam and Max at

409
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,280
least part one, maybe all the way through part three, depending on how I enjoy it, before

410
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,400
the month's over, which doesn't give me much time.

411
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,660
Hopefully the series will run a little longer than the cartoon series that they had.

412
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,280
You can see the cartoon series on GameTap, for whatever it's worth.

413
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,960
Well, for our PC gamers, there's a bit of sad news.

414
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,400
Age of Conan has been delayed even longer.

415
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,680
It will be out in October, it actually will ship October 30th.

416
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:13,960
Xbox 360 version is going to be in 2008, so it'll be after that.

417
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,360
It looks interesting.

418
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,400
It looks pretty, I guess.

419
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,840
But you know, I think that our PC fans that have been looking forward to this, I feel

420
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,560
sorry that you have to wait any longer, but...

421
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,320
Just it doesn't look like your cup of tea, particularly.

422
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
No.

423
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,040
Bring on the BBC chibi game.

424
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,920
Hell no!

425
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
I...

426
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,440
I'm just messing with you.

427
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,440
What?

428
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Playing Guild Wars.

429
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Heart.

430
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,160
Guild Wars is pretty... are you actually playing Guild Wars?

431
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,400
I'll go back to Guild Wars and play one more.

432
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,560
If that thing hasn't expired, then yeah.

433
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,020
You should come play WoW with us.

434
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
Come play WoW.

435
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,020
Pay for my account, okay?

436
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,020
No.

437
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
I don't have money.

438
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,800
Maybe for your birthday I'll get you a card, so you can come play WoW with us.

439
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Okay.

440
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,800
I'll get you a Blizzard card.

441
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
You know what they need to do?

442
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
What?

443
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,400
They need to have porn tycoon, because that would be the greatest game to like, you know,

444
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,280
run your porn, you know...

445
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,640
What the fuck did that have to do with anything we were just talking about?

446
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,080
I saw an ad for a tycoon game and I was thinking PC stuff.

447
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,280
I think that'd be awesome.

448
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,160
There could be some major money made there.

449
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,040
And then just come out on the DS.

450
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,760
Any more curveballs you want to throw at us?

451
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,200
Well if, you know, you're not into porn tycoon or, you know, Age of Conan, you might be interested

452
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,220
in Ghost Recon Advance of Warfighter 2 for the PC.

453
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,960
It's going to be coming out day and date with the Xbox 360 version, which is March 9th.

454
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,360
It's going to feature some more multiplayer stuff as well as up to 32 players online,

455
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,880
and more game modes, including the, you know, standard deathmatch co-op and stuff.

456
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,720
Plus it's just going to have a whole new storyline.

457
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,240
Be honest, the game looked originally kind of like the first one a lot, but, you know,

458
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,840
the storyline sounds pretty interesting.

459
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,760
Almost like they're going to do, I want to say there's like, Mexicans invading Texas

460
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,400
or something, and some sort of, like, they have to stave off some civil war over Mexico

461
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
and stuff.

462
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,360
I don't know, it was a fun game the first time around.

463
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,560
I cheated the whole way through it, by the way.

464
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
Surprise.

465
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
It was fun, though.

466
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,600
Infinite grenade launchers are awesome.

467
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,440
See, I knew you and your random porn tycoon outburst would stir chat.

468
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,360
Oh, going on in our chat room.

469
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,880
The Rob D. says, Loki just had his, what if it snowed in San Francisco moment?

470
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Mechlar says, porn tycoon, first off, build a fluffer room.

471
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,800
Because the fluffers aren't an important part of pornography.

472
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,560
And then Dark Tetsuya says, I thought they made that.

473
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,480
It was called Playboy Mansion.

474
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,160
No, Playboy Mansion was lame.

475
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,960
How would you improve on Playboy Mansion for porn tycoon?

476
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,020
Um, actually make it cool and not Playboy, because Playboy, to be honest, just sucks.

477
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:57,000
They just want to be x-rated, but they're too classy for that shit, so, you know, if

478
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,880
it was like, you know, Penthouse Mansion or something like that, I'd be a little, you

479
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,400
know, step in the right direction there.

480
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,520
Joshi16 says, Neverland Ranch tycoon, one person buys it, guess who?

481
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,040
Peter Pan?

482
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,480
All right, well, you know, I think the tycoon series is one of those series that has just

483
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,920
been done over and over and over to death, but GamesRadar.com would disagree because

484
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,840
they posted their list of the top seven series run into the ground this week.

485
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,640
And this, of course, would be games that, you know, they were popular and then things

486
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,320
just start to kind of go wrong with the series.

487
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,360
So have you guys seen this list already?

488
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,200
Loki, Jamie, have you guys seen the list already?

489
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Yeah.

490
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,680
Okay, Loki, Jamie, have you read this list already?

491
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,120
Okay, what would you think would be on this list, besides Tomb Raider, which is up on

492
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,280
the screen right now?

493
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,400
What games do you think, number seven is Tomb Raider, what series do you think have just

494
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,840
been run into the ground?

495
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,320
Remakes of Final Fantasy VII.

496
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
Okay, well, let's see if it shows up.

497
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,680
All right, number seven is Tomb Raider.

498
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,320
Number six is Mega Man, because, I mean, really, I mean, there's been all those stinking battle

499
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,320
network games, but there was, you know, there was never really a Mega Man 9.

500
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,760
Mega Man X games kind of ended in 2004, and so, you know, Mega Man's just kind of been

501
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,880
done to death.

502
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,480
They need a resurgence of Mega Man, I think.

503
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,040
Viewtiful Joe is at number five, which I think is an interesting selection.

504
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,240
They had like two or three games for that series.

505
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
That's hardly run into the ground.

506
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,060
But were any of them as good as the first one?

507
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,560
But they, you know, to be honest, though, they may not have been as good as the first

508
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,280
one, but it's like, it's, you have to kind of take off to run it into the ground, you

509
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,280
know what I mean?

510
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,520
GamesRadar cites Red Hot Rumble, which was a Smash Brothers type fighter game that had

511
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,360
Viewtiful Joe characters in it.

512
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
Number four was Dynasty Warriors.

513
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,560
That game, every single Dynasty Warriors game is exactly the same as the one before it.

514
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,040
And then they keep doing this fucking Empire shit, which is exactly the same game all over

515
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
again.

516
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,880
Number three is Tenchu, and they cite the PSP version, as this has just been done too

517
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
much now.

518
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Who cares?

519
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,760
I mean, that game, I don't, there's still not that many games.

520
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Number two is Spy Hunter.

521
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I agree with this.

522
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,560
Okay, there's been like three games in that series, or four.

523
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,520
But seriously, it was, it was gone for the longest time.

524
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,960
You had Spy Hunter and then a forgettable sequel in the arcades, and then it was gone

525
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,180
forever, and then suddenly Midway decided to make this resurgence out of it, and it's

526
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,080
not been anything to scream about.

527
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
Right?

528
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
Okay.

529
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,760
Alright, well that's why they say they run it into the ground.

530
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:33,360
They cite Spy Hunter 2 and Spy Hunter Nowhere to Run, three games by three different developers.

531
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,480
The number one series they say has been run into the ground, Sonic the Hedgehog, the number

532
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
one series.

533
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,920
And of course they cite the GBA port of the original that was god-awful, in 2006 Rivals

534
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,000
and Riders, which weren't that great.

535
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,240
Of course this new one that's god-awful, they say the last truly good Sonic game according

536
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,480
to GamesRadar, Sonic Rush back in 2005 was the last good one.

537
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,080
You know what I think is interesting though?

538
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,480
I know a lot of folks out there think we're Nintendo fanboys and girls here on this program,

539
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,400
and to some extent, you know, we are a little bit, but hasn't Mario had some pretty shitty

540
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
games too?

541
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Yeah.

542
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,440
Did you ever play Mario is Missing?

543
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,680
That was a PC game though.

544
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,560
No, it was, there was a version on Super Nintendo that was pretty awful.

545
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,200
Luigi's Mansion, not that great.

546
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,160
A lot of people didn't like Mario Sunshine.

547
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,680
I thought it was pretty good myself, but a lot of folks didn't like it for whatever reason.

548
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,720
Why is Mario getting a buy out of all this?

549
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,880
I mean, I guess, I don't know, maybe because Mario 64 was pretty rad and some of the new

550
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,920
Super Mario Brothers, but I don't know, it kind of seems like some people get a buy out

551
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,360
of this.

552
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
There's been some pretty shitty Mario games.

553
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Yeah.

554
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
So I don't know.

555
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,080
Mario is Missing.

556
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
What about Donkey Kong?

557
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,800
Oh, that Mario vs. Donkey Kong, well those games are okay.

558
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,360
No, I meant just Donkey Kong stuff.

559
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
I mean, the Donkey Kong Country series.

560
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Donkey Kong Country got rammed into the ground.

561
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,480
It was okay, but then they had a stupid fucking Bongo shit, and then, I don't know.

562
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,800
I don't know, the Bongo games were interesting.

563
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,240
Yeah, but then they had those other ones where you had to use the Bongos to move up a, what

564
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,120
was that one where you had to basically just use the L and R buttons on it?

565
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
I don't know.

566
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,200
I think a lot of the franchises out there kind of suck.

567
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,320
Ooh, Rama made a good one that these guys left off the list.

568
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,620
Don't forget Spyro.

569
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,400
That's a great one that should have been on the list.

570
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Good catch, Rama.

571
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,040
Or Crash Bandicoot.

572
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,080
Those are both really good ones.

573
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,120
Let's see, what else do we have?

574
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,800
The Rob D says, yeah, but the last real Mario game came out 11 years ago.

575
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,520
That would depend on what you consider a real Mario game.

576
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
How about Rampage?

577
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Oh, that's a good one, too.

578
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,080
See, we should come up with our own list, and of course, Jeremy Todd once says Metal

579
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
Slug.

580
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Actually.

581
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,080
What about Contra?

582
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,000
It's been a while since we had a Contra game, hasn't it?

583
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
No, last year.

584
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Well, besides the arcade.

585
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Really?

586
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,320
Well, I meant like 2005.

587
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
We had Shattered...

588
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Wait, not Shattered Soldier.

589
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,360
Damn, I don't remember the last one.

590
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,560
Vidpowah says, I admit I had a blast with the Mario is Missing games.

591
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,000
Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed it.

592
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Ninja Turtle games.

593
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh, good one.

594
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,960
See, we got some really good ones here, but the list wasn't so bad as it was.

595
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,720
All right, well, another thing that's not so bad is reading your emails that we get

596
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
every week.

597
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,080
We rather enjoy it, and DarkSakura is queen of the mailbag, and when you send your emails

598
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,600
to mailbag at orangelaungerator.com, DarkSakura will read and often respond to your emails

599
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,120
and pick some of her favorites to read here on the program, again, because we do get quite

600
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
a few letters.

601
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,080
We can't read them all, but we can try.

602
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,480
So DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we've got to read

603
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
this week.

604
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,200
DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?

605
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,240
Two emails.

606
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
That's it?

607
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Yeah.

608
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
All right.

609
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Well, let's do it.

610
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Okay.

611
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
First one.

612
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Salutations, O.L.R.

613
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
Cast.

614
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,600
I just had a question about the Nintendo Wii and if its games contain region coding.

615
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Thanks for reading this.

616
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,440
Also, I don't know if you guys heard about this article, but someone tried to electrocute

617
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,340
themselves with an arcade machine.

618
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,240
Their Pac-Man high score was beaten, and he claimed that he had nothing left to live for,

619
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,120
so he attempted suicide with a Pac-Man machine.

620
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
Pretty weird, though.

621
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,520
Comes from Blue Zenith.

622
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,240
He should have just tipped the machine over on himself.

623
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
That wouldn't kill anybody.

624
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,640
I've had an arcade machine fall on me.

625
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
First of all...

626
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,440
Did it hit you in the head?

627
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,800
Because that might explain some stuff.

628
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,040
Teasing just heart.

629
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,440
I'm letting you buy me dinner.

630
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,960
You can make it up to me with potato pancakes.

631
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,340
My car is dead.

632
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
As for the Wii...

633
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,760
Would you like a nice cup?

634
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Would you like me to bring you a cup of wham?

635
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,960
Rob, I'm trying to do emails, so you can shut up, okay?

636
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,960
All.

637
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Own.

638
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Okay.

639
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Jamie.

640
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Jamie.

641
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Jamie.

642
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
Jamie.

643
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,920
So at any rate, the Nintendo Wii is definitely region coded, so yeah.

644
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
But they're working on it.

645
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,920
They're working on it.

646
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:14,080
And also about someone killing themselves over a score.

647
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,920
Darwin loves them.

648
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,440
Sorry, that type of person should be removed from the dream pool.

649
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,040
Moving forward to the next and last email.

650
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,600
A pretty long one coming to us from someone who has not signed the email, so I'm just

651
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
going to say JCK.

652
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,800
Hey guys, great show.

653
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,920
Just wanted to give some feedback.

654
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,180
Two news items on last week's show.

655
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:45,680
The Dallas Area TV Network's WFAA's report on the PS3 and Wii as a gateway to porn, and

656
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
the New York State Bill...

657
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
Really?

658
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
They're giving away porn on the PS3?

659
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Now I'll buy one.

660
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
Hey Rob, shut up.

661
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,860
And the New York State Bill A00547, and later the A02024, prohibiting the sale of certain

662
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
games to minors.

663
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,560
Do you want to read the email, though, if you really want to talk?

664
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
No, no, I'm fine.

665
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,080
I'm going to go get more coffee for my Hello Kitty maker.

666
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Okay.

667
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,600
There are two kinds of parents, those who accept that the world is hostile and their

668
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,280
children must be proactively educated or sheltered, and those who want the world to be safe so

669
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,960
that their children will be sheltered naturally with a minimum of parental involvement.

670
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,220
Most parents are lazy and fall into the second category.

671
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,120
There are ones who are technophobic and will not take the time to investigate parental

672
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,160
controls on hardware and software.

673
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,240
They are the ones who seek to censor and control every content distribution chain.

674
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,480
The problem is that the world cannot be made safe, even if we could agree on what safe

675
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,840
is without oppressing sub-subculture somewhere.

676
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,360
It is impossible for any of us to remake the world in our own image.

677
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,440
We have to accept that things that we don't like exist, that our children will stumble

678
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
onto them if we don't shelter them or otherwise prepare them for that initial contact.

679
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,480
I may not agree with the religious conservatives who homeschool their kids and filter their

680
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,420
TV, but at least they're active parents.

681
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,400
There are legal issues that surround the New York Bills.

682
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
First of all, who decides what is objectionable?

683
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,960
The ESRB and MPAA are private industry bodies.

684
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,560
We cannot pass a law that deputizes these private bodies to rate things, which is why

685
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,840
a law that limits the sale of M or AO games is unenforceable.

686
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,800
If the government seeks to control, it must create a government body to identify what

687
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,060
to control.

688
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,000
Every ratings scheme in the U.S. is voluntary, the music industry chooses to use parental

689
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:35,200
advisory, the music industry chooses to get MPAA ratings, and the gaming industry chooses

690
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,060
to submit to the ESRB.

691
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,160
The public pressure is on retail distribution chains to comply with what forces the content

692
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,360
creators to adhere, which is why every major game retailer already checks ID.

693
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,960
The system works and there is no reason to change it.

694
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,240
And that's the end of the email.

695
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Yes?

696
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,840
I got nothing.

697
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:15,640
I have a whole problem with the government being way too involved in our personal lives.

698
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:28,080
I think that it is unreasonable to expect somebody else to do to protect their children

699
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,960
from influences there are really no way to control.

700
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,240
It is your job, I'm sorry, it is a person's job as a parent to prepare their child for

701
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,360
the real world.

702
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,680
I've seen what's become of people who are too sheltered, they usually end up with severe

703
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,880
social problems.

704
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:58,480
The reference to the homeschool religious fundamentalist, a friend of mine that I met

705
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:06,680
here when I moved out to California, she had been so sheltered, she actually didn't go

706
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:17,660
to school until she was in high school and thought that oral sex was talking about sex.

707
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:23,200
I knew someone who thought the F word was fart.

708
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,420
And so when confronted with the reality of their ignorance, you know, who's to blame

709
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,640
but their parents, you know, keeping them from the stuff that's going on in the real

710
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
world.

711
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:41,160
To go back to the statement regarding needing a governmental body to participate with a

712
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:49,080
government controlled law, I guess it's the government controlled, that's not redundant.

713
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:56,480
I understand the logic in that but I still think that if we have a private party that

714
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:04,640
is not involved in the government, we are likely to get less, I would say, bias.

715
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,120
I'm sorry, our government is bought and paid for, you know.

716
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:16,480
For every person that you elect into government positions, there's a lobbyist behind them

717
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,600
paying lots of money for them to say, you know, I think that cigarettes are okay.

718
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,680
Is that why Travis is running for president?

719
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
I don't know.

720
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
I don't know either.

721
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,440
I was just putting that out there.

722
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:35,460
So I actually think that it is better for us to have that separation with those facilities

723
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,920
and the government.

724
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,440
I think the law is unnecessary and I agree, unenforceable the way it is in its current

725
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,440
incarnation.

726
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,320
All right, well I read through the email while you were ranting there and it was well thought

727
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
out.

728
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,680
I like getting those thoughtful emails.

729
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,480
I love when people with brains email us.

730
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,000
All right, so you should email us too, mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

731
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And please be smart.

732
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,400
Oh, dude, we got another email just as I was closing the box.

733
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,080
They're already smart because they listen to this program.

734
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm going to read this now because it's by NintendoManiac64, worth a thousand words dot

735
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,160
com, an entry into this internet porn tycoon.

736
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Oh, I get it.

737
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,400
They've got a picture of that of somebody had already done this on this worth a thousand

738
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
dot com.

739
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,440
Somebody photoshopped railroad tycoons, this internet porn tycoon.

740
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
There you go.

741
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,440
That's awesome.

742
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Yeah.

743
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Thank you for sharing that with us, NintendoManiac64.

744
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Too bad it's not real.

745
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I know.

746
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,120
Well, I can only hope.

747
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,440
By microprobe, that's fantastic.

748
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,960
That was, oh microprobes was the one that made it originally.

749
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
I see what they did there.

750
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,600
Yay, Photoshop.

751
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,400
Anyways, so in the past PlayStation portable firmware has been defeated by Grand Theft

752
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:56,280
Auto Liberty City Stories, and of course Sony went and apparently fixed the hole, or so

753
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,000
they thought.

754
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,080
Now people have found another way using Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, one of the

755
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,600
original copies, that you can once again break the firmware.

756
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
What have they done?

757
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,640
Yep, they've done it.

758
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,720
They've made their wonderful Hello World proof of concept thing, and even today, which just

759
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:21,480
got released, a downgrader for firmware 3.03, so try as you might Sony, you'll just never

760
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
win.

761
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,600
Never, ever.

762
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,720
So this is why consoles shouldn't have firmwares.

763
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,480
They should just be good to go instead of having to upgrade.

764
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,820
What's the big deal about homebrew on the PSP anyway?

765
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,160
Is it really that bad?

766
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,080
Is it really killing families across America?

767
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,040
Is it really something that has to be prevented at all costs?

768
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,040
No.

769
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,720
In fact, they're encouraging it on the PlayStation 3, but that's still been...

770
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,200
People are going to pirate the, you know, they're going to break the firmware to pirate

771
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
shit, so...

772
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,720
I was reading somewhere else that HD DVD, of course, you know, they finally had to admit

773
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,240
that yes, it's been cracked.

774
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
Hey Rob.

775
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
What?

776
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,440
This kick to your ass is courtesy of DMN.

777
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
What?

778
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
Yep.

779
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,200
Tell DMN to go suck on a...

780
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,160
Anyway, I wanted to just say really quickly, and then we're going to get into the Skype

781
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,600
line and hear what you guys have to say, and play a voicemail.

782
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,400
We got one voicemail this week that's pretty interesting.

783
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
I want you guys to hear it.

784
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,160
I want to say this real quickly.

785
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,600
You might remember when Halo 2 was first coming out and was being promoted very heavily, they

786
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,840
used a viral site to promote it, and it was called ilovebees.com was the name of the site.

787
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Well, guess what?

788
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,000
It's back, and kind of convenient, don't you think, because Halo 3 is coming out before

789
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,200
too long, and the beta is happening pretty soon?

790
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
Makes you think.

791
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,200
But bees are great.

792
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,200
Well, if you love bees...

793
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,880
They give us honey and sting us.

794
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,760
And then they die when they sting you.

795
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,680
If you love bees, check out the site.

796
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
It's ilovebees.com.

797
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,660
All right, we're going to get into the Skype line and take some of your calls here live

798
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,480
on Orange Lounge Radio, but first, I want to play a voicemail that came into our line

799
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,600
this week, and of course, we always invite your voicemails on any topic.

800
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,920
You can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live, or for those of you guys

801
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,880
outside the US or Canada where that number is toll free, you can always give us a call

802
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,300
on the Skype line.

803
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,640
Just download Skype and call username Orange Lounge Radio.

804
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,800
That's us, and you can leave us a message throughout the week, but keep in mind if you

805
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,640
call right now, you're probably going to get on the Skype line.

806
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,160
We'll take you live on air, but if you're the type that likes to formulate your thoughts

807
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,260
first and then leave us a voicemail, you can do that, or sometimes we get other craziness

808
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:27,040
on our voicemail line, and I mean craziness, so check this out, because this is pretty

809
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,040
crazy.

810
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,600
You might have to listen kind of carefully, because they talk fast, because you can definitely

811
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,440
sense there's a lot of excitement in the room, so check this out.

812
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,680
Hey, Rob, it's me.

813
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,680
I just finished the free spot call, so it was awesome.

814
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,680
It was a surprise for you, hold on.

815
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Yeah, Rob, this is Sheriff for Free Spot.

816
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,680
What's going on, man?

817
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,680
Adam and I are just chatting, and we're like, wait, what is this?

818
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
Is he going to show up tonight?

819
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
I don't know.

820
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,680
We don't know.

821
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Is he going to fly in?

822
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,680
I don't know.

823
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Is he going to fly in tonight?

824
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,680
I don't know.

825
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,680
We're looking for helicopters, you know, here.

826
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,680
Anyway, this is Sheriff for Free Spot.

827
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Hope you're doing well.

828
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,680
Rock out.

829
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,680
Have a good time.

830
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
Guitar Hero, Fun Times, Anime.

831
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,680
Good times all around, yeah.

832
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,680
Free spot.

833
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Go, go, go.

834
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
Here's Adam again.

835
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
He's got something he has to say.

836
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,680
Enjoy your voice, man.

837
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,680
I'll be listening to him on Sunday, live in the chat later.

838
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
Thanks, hold on.

839
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,880
Okay, let me translate, because those guys talked faster than the Micro Machines guy.

840
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,480
That apparently was Sean from Freeze Pop leaving the message, because Rama went to the concert

841
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,480
in New York City the other night and got them to leave a message.

842
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,200
He texted me on my phone while I was in school.

843
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,200
That's funny.

844
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,680
See, sometimes we get craziness on the voicemail line, so I encourage you folks, program the

845
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,600
1-877-GAME-OLR into your cell phone.

846
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,560
When you come across internet celebrities such as this guy from Freeze Pop, then you

847
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,080
should have them call in and leave us crazy voicemails, because, you know, that's fun.

848
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,720
All right, we're going to open up our Skype line.

849
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,120
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or its username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

850
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,600
We want to offer up you guys to interact with our program here on Orange Lounge Radio, because

851
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,240
you know, it doesn't have to be all about us.

852
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
I mean, to some extent.

853
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,240
It could be all about me.

854
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,760
To some extent it does have to be all about us, but we want it to be about you guys as

855
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
well.

856
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,400
So give us a call right now on the Skype line and we'll take some calls.

857
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,720
Let's start off with this call tonight.

858
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

859
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,200
This is D.M.N.

860
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,760
San's really crappy microphone.

861
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,760
Hi, D.M.N.

862
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,160
San's really crappy microphone.

863
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,600
Hey, I'm going to kick your ass next time I see you.

864
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Bring it, motherfucker.

865
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,600
What?

866
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:37,240
Oh, wow, I'm just reading in the chatroom, apparently 2DX Gold is supposed to be at Konami

867
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,680
Gamers' Day, which we're going to next week.

868
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
That's pretty hot.

869
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,680
Oh, really?

870
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
I don't know where the hell that came from.

871
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,400
Somebody just blurted that out in chat.

872
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,760
Can somebody back that up?

873
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
I wouldn't doubt it.

874
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,760
Oh, no, I see.

875
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,280
Mecklar, oh, and 2DX Gold is going over to America, left the UK a day ago.

876
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,600
Not sure where it's going, though.

877
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,040
You guys got any big conventions or game shows soon, and Jason put it together that it must

878
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,200
be coming over to Konami Gamers' Day.

879
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
It's pretty hot.

880
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,200
It's coming to Sakura Con.

881
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
That's where it's going.

882
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
I'm so planning to go spread your socks.

883
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,200
We'll see what happens.

884
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
I don't know.

885
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
I don't know what's going to happen.

886
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,800
We're going to have a full report on Konami Gamers' Day next week, and keep an eye on

887
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,560
our website Thursday and Friday.

888
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,960
All the news that we get there is embargoed until a certain time, but the minute that

889
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,000
embargo's up, we're going to post a ton of shit from the show, so we're really excited.

890
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,280
Anyway, D.M.N., what's on your mind tonight?

891
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
Three things.

892
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,560
One, huge STFU announcement this coming week.

893
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,400
This is your Thursday night program, yes?

894
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Yes.

895
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,760
Not this week, but next week.

896
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,760
We're going to have MC Frontalot on the show for five good minutes.

897
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,960
I hate you!

898
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,920
No you don't.

899
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,920
I knew Jamie would be pissed.

900
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,160
Tell him to say something for me and record it, please.

901
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,760
How about we Skype you in?

902
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
You can talk to him.

903
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
I have school.

904
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,840
I have no problem with that.

905
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,440
When are you guys taping it?

906
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,440
Because you don't do it live.

907
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
When are you guys taping it?

908
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
I don't know.

909
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,760
I don't know if you posted, but I'll kick Jimmy to the curb and you can interview with

910
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,760
me.

911
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,760
There you go.

912
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,080
I have school every night this week, dude.

913
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,080
It's not this week.

914
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,080
It's next week.

915
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,080
Oh.

916
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,240
Why don't your people talk to his people and see what you can come up with?

917
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,240
My people will talk to your people.

918
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,240
All right.

919
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Maybe we can get him on this show.

920
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,200
Well, anyway, so that's exciting news for you guys.

921
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,160
You guys are getting more celebrities than we are.

922
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
What the fuck?

923
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,000
We've been around for five years.

924
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,840
You guys are on like nine weeks and you're having frickin'... fuck you.

925
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
All right.

926
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,480
I love you too, Rob.

927
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,440
Did you just call to rub it in or is there anything else you want to share?

928
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,440
No.

929
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,440
I actually had two things.

930
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,600
One, I have a review of Bookworm Adventures.

931
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,640
Dude, Bookworm Adventures is awesome.

932
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,640
Yes.

933
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,640
Dude, you're almost playing that.

934
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,040
Pretty much the greatest casual game ever made.

935
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,880
That's what Xbox Live needs.

936
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,840
It's 30 bucks for the full version and that sounds kind of steep.

937
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,200
I would play that.

938
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
So I have a keyboard?

939
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,760
Yeah, but not everyone does.

940
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,880
Well, fuck them.

941
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,440
It's 30 bucks for the full version.

942
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,640
It's a bit steep, but very much worth it.

943
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,840
Exciting.

944
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,960
Is there any particular reason you love Bookworm Adventures?

945
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,680
Is it the smarts you get to use in constructing words?

946
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,680
Is it the graphics?

947
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,360
What is it about the game?

948
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,440
It's that and it's the charm.

949
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,240
The game makes this really crazy deep voice like a voiceover guy.

950
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,400
If you beat the crap out of an enemy, it's like CRUSHED.

951
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
It's pretty cool.

952
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,160
Can you do that one more time, please?

953
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,160
CRUSHED.

954
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,160
That's pretty awesome.

955
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,120
Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, DMN?

956
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,520
Yeah, bonus segment.

957
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,720
I wanted to talk about that.

958
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:43,440
I know the podcast listeners didn't hear it, but I actually can totally sympathize with

959
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,440
that one lady because I just broke up with my girlfriend over WoW.

960
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Really?

961
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,520
I remember calling her or you or the both of you during Guys on a Show one night.

962
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,400
No, it wasn't Guys on a Show, it was this show when I was really fucking plastic.

963
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
Oh, that's right.

964
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
When you called in here drunk.

965
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,320
So, you guys broke up over WoW?

966
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,320
What happened?

967
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Over WoW.

968
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:12,600
Well, one, I came over to visit her several weeks ago and she decided that playing WoW

969
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,320
and raiding was more important than spending time with me and that kind of pissed me off.

970
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,680
And then I called her earlier this week to see if she wanted to do something and she's

971
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,840
like, no, I'm playing Burning Crusade, I'm trying to get 70.

972
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,620
I'm like, okay, you know what?

973
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,620
That's it.

974
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,200
I'm done with this shit.

975
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
What do you want?

976
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,080
Do you want level 70 or cock?

977
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,080
You need to make a decision.

978
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,360
Is that what you told her?

979
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,960
Just like, you know, you find WoW more important than, you know, hanging out with me and I

980
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,120
care about you and I do all this shit for you.

981
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,440
That's how I would break it down.

982
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,720
I would say, you know, if I was having this problem in a relationship, I would say, look,

983
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,160
do you want level 70 or do you want the cock because you can't have both.

984
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,200
I game and I get laid when I want it.

985
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
All right.

986
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,300
Well, aren't you?

987
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,880
That's because you married a nerd.

988
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
Yes, I did.

989
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
It's great.

990
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,880
All right.

991
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,880
DMN, anything else you want to share?

992
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,880
We got to let some other people on.

993
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,880
You need to tell Robbie Parks like an asshole.

994
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,520
Yeah, Rob, your parking sucks.

995
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,520
Really?

996
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,520
Why does my parking suck?

997
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
Okay.

998
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,520
When I was down...

999
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
Oops.

1000
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,520
We lost the connection.

1001
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:24,400
If you would like to call us, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can give

1002
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,400
us a call.

1003
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,560
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1004
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,280
That's toll free in the United States.

1005
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,840
Hey, Rob, can't hang up on me.

1006
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,960
No, but I can unplug your mic.

1007
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,320
Yeah, and I can steal yours and beat you in the head with it.

1008
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
What was that, Jamie?

1009
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,320
No, you...

1010
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,320
Nope.

1011
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
Ow, ow.

1012
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:49,840
Damn it, her mic is like hardwired in that fucking mix board.

1013
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,560
That's because my powerful, awesome voice has fused it there.

1014
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,520
I totally owned Rob.

1015
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
Whatever.

1016
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,200
I'm sorry if I broke your arm.

1017
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
You hurt.

1018
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,200
You'll just have to give me a free massage.

1019
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:12,160
You'll just have to give me a free massage from MassageTheRapist.com.

1020
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,160
Rob!

1021
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,080
I take my professions seriously.

1022
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,920
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1023
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,920
Who's this?

1024
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,920
Legend of Zaku.

1025
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,920
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

1026
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
What's on your mind, buddy?

1027
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,200
All that 2DX stuff that I've been hearing from over the pond.

1028
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,200
Over the pond?

1029
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,680
Yeah, that whole Ghostbusters thing that kind of shocked us last week.

1030
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
Remember?

1031
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,320
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1032
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,320
What about it?

1033
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,560
No, I'm just saying, you know, from what I've been hearing, Konami Gamers Day might have

1034
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,560
gold.

1035
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,560
I don't...

1036
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,560
I just want, you know...

1037
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,560
You know what?

1038
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,560
You know what?

1039
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,360
I'm not going to this event to, you know, to play all the cool stuff.

1040
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,940
I'm going to, you know, hear what is coming out so I can report back to all you guys what

1041
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,940
sounds cool.

1042
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,940
Exactly.

1043
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,940
If it's there, it's there.

1044
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:03,940
Loki will, too.

1045
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,880
Dark Soccer, unfortunately, is unable to attend because of school, but we'll give you our

1046
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,000
thoughts.

1047
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,640
You also know that Betsun mentioned in a press release that they're supposed to be having,

1048
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,640
you know...

1049
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,400
One of their top guys said that they're supposed to be having a content update for Supernova

1050
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,600
that's supposed to have two to three hundred more songs into it.

1051
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,600
Two to three hundred more songs than DDR Supernova in the arcade?

1052
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,080
Show Betsun press release.

1053
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,080
Wow.

1054
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,480
Well, who knows?

1055
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,680
This could be something they're announcing.

1056
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,640
I think Konami's gearing up for lots of announcements this week.

1057
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,520
They've been kind of quiet, so I think we're going to get just blasted with stuff.

1058
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,560
I think if that is true, you'll hear about it Thursday.

1059
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,480
If you don't hear about it then, or Friday, I don't know when the news is embargoed, but

1060
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,240
Thursday or Friday, if you don't hear after that, it probably wasn't true.

1061
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,960
But I could do it right now.

1062
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Watch.

1063
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
I'll post it up on chat.

1064
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Yeah.

1065
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,960
There we go.

1066
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,720
Well, okay, but how often are things talked about that don't necessarily happen, such

1067
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,560
as Link Mode?

1068
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:10,360
Well, that was never the best since its fall.

1069
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,600
That was because they got shafted by the people that were supposed to make the part for them.

1070
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:20,160
And so, you know, I was disappointed at first, but I let that slide because obviously, you

1071
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,580
know, I have faith that Konami might find another way.

1072
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,440
But if they don't, so be it.

1073
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,480
I mean, they'll eventually find an alternative.

1074
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,320
I mean, now, right now, probably in the next.

1075
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,320
Right.

1076
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,200
You've been playing anything else besides Bomani lately?

1077
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,440
More on the Groove R21, and I just played Drummania today.

1078
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,440
Okay, let me rephrase.

1079
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,880
Have you been playing anything that is not a music game?

1080
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,280
I started playing Initial D today.

1081
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
All right.

1082
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,280
There you go.

1083
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,280
That's something.

1084
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,280
And in the arcade?

1085
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,280
Yeah.

1086
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,280
I bought the card and everything.

1087
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,280
How is that?

1088
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,880
Is there a lot of competition in your neck of the woods?

1089
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,240
I actually traveled out of state today.

1090
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,960
It was a tournament, so I managed to play, you know.

1091
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,080
In addition to other stuff, I just played, you know, I managed to get into Initial D

1092
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,080
while I was at it.

1093
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,080
So yeah.

1094
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:12,920
I mean, it wasn't that much, but it's really hard to find an Initial D machine in Chinatown

1095
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
anyways.

1096
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,440
I know one place, but I will make efforts to follow up on that.

1097
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,440
All right.

1098
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
All right.

1099
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,480
Well, Zaku, your voice is breaking up a little bit, but thanks so much for calling in, as

1100
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,480
you always do.

1101
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,480
And we'll talk to you another time already.

1102
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
All right.

1103
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:33,840
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or it's username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype.

1104
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,320
If you're sick of the same old people calling in week after week, then you're not helping,

1105
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,480
because you're not calling us, so you should get on your telephone and give us a call right

1106
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,480
now.

1107
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,480
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1108
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,680
Otherwise, it's going to be the same people get through every week.

1109
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,840
Or you can always leave us a voicemail, because I know some folks can't listen live on Sunday,

1110
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,480
and so they want to, you know, interact with us in other ways.

1111
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,640
I guess we'll do one more call.

1112
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,320
We'll go over to this one.

1113
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,720
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1114
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,720
Who's this?

1115
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
It's Rama.

1116
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,720
What's up?

1117
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,720
How you guys doing?

1118
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Hey, Rama.

1119
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,720
How you doing, baby?

1120
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,720
You've already been on the show today.

1121
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,720
Hi.

1122
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,720
Your voicemail.

1123
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,720
Well, I do.

1124
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,720
I can't help the show out.

1125
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,720
You know me.

1126
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,720
I love you guys and girls.

1127
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,720
I know.

1128
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,720
It was cool.

1129
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,720
Thanks a lot.

1130
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,720
That's fun.

1131
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,720
You know, we had FreezePop.

1132
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,200
At least we had Casson from FreezePop about a year ago on the show, and it was very nice.

1133
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,200
I wish them a lot of success.

1134
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,680
They're a good bunch.

1135
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,680
Sweetness.

1136
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,800
I also hope you like the voice while I left it on your personal line.

1137
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,800
You know what?

1138
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,800
It cut out.

1139
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,800
What was it supposed to be?

1140
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,480
Because, like, I heard, like, a couple notes, like, they were playing a song.

1141
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,760
Like, it sounded like they were starting to play a song, but it cut, like, you were obviously

1142
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,000
indoors because it cut out.

1143
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,680
What were you trying to leave?

1144
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,160
Let's talk more rock.

1145
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,160
Ah, okay.

1146
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,160
See, all I could hear, like, this is the voicemail.

1147
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,160
It was like, this is for you, Rob.

1148
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,120
And then that's all I could hear, and then it, like, went, you know, cell phone drop.

1149
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,840
You might need to switch carriers.

1150
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,400
Because when we played that, there were a few people that showed up with their Guitar

1151
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,400
Hero controllers.

1152
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,600
They moved towards the front and started, like, freestyling on the song.

1153
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,600
People showed up with their Guitar Hero controller to the FreezePop concert?

1154
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,600
Yes.

1155
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,720
One of my friends, Aaron, he got them to sign his controller.

1156
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,720
That's pretty hardcore.

1157
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
I like that, though.

1158
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,720
That's rad.

1159
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,720
Yeah.

1160
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,720
Definitely.

1161
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
All right.

1162
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
Well, anything else you want to share with us, Rama?

1163
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,280
Did you have a good time at the concert overall?

1164
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,280
Yes, I did.

1165
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,640
And I also picked up another video game.

1166
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,120
I got Elite Beat Agents.

1167
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,760
Ooh, Elite Beat Agents, one of my favorites from 2006.

1168
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,760
What'd you think?

1169
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,760
It's fun.

1170
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,200
It's not as easy than Oh and Don, but I'm enjoying it.

1171
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,400
Wait till it, the difficulty really ramps up as you go through it.

1172
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,880
Oh, I believe it.

1173
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,320
I'm trying to finish the last song on easy.

1174
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
All right.

1175
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:50,280
All right, well, Rama, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for the voicemails.

1176
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,280
We appreciate it.

1177
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,280
No problem.

1178
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,320
Hey, my friend, Patty, agrees with you, what you said about the whole Wii incident, just

1179
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
letting you know.

1180
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,320
All right.

1181
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
Cool.

1182
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Thanks for the support.

1183
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,320
All right.

1184
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Later.

1185
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
All right.

1186
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Bye.

1187
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,320
All right.

1188
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
Thanks so much to all of our callers tonight.

1189
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,320
We appreciate it.

1190
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,320
If you didn't get through, that's okay.

1191
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,320
You can always leave us a voicemail.

1192
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,320
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.

1193
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,640
Now I'm going to open it up to any last-minute stories we have here in the studio.

1194
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,440
Any last-minute stories from anyone?

1195
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,720
Oh, yeah.

1196
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,720
Loki.

1197
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,000
Anyways, some interesting stuff for the PSP, including a brand-new game coming to it.

1198
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,160
This should get Jamie happy, or very happy here.

1199
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Happity.

1200
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,160
Happity.

1201
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,160
Yes.

1202
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,160
Very happily.

1203
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,160
Yay.

1204
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:38,520
Dracula X, Rondo of Blood is coming to the PSP, according to UK-based gaming magazine

1205
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,520
Play.

1206
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,360
So that's kind of cool.

1207
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:53,000
Other stuff, though, if you're expecting Final Fantasy XIII this year, sorry to disappoint

1208
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
you, but that's not happening.

1209
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Dream on.

1210
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
We can all do that.

1211
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:03,080
According to Tetsuya Nomura himself, said it's not going to happen, and says, I'm hoping

1212
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:09,360
to play, or hopefully going to be out in 2008.

1213
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,180
Yeah, and even that, they'll probably get it late 2008 in Japan, and then we won't get

1214
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:21,400
it here until 2009, which sucks, because that'll be when I get a PlayStation 3, that'll be

1215
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
2009.

1216
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Yeah.

1217
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,800
According to Midway, because I know they've had their Midway's Gamer Day, was actually

1218
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:35,600
last week, they had some info regarding the Midway Classics that are going to be on the

1219
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,640
PlayStation Network.

1220
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:46,520
Of course, some of the pricing for that, Demon Slayer is going to be $4.99, and it should

1221
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:53,040
hit the PlayStation Store in the next few months, but it doesn't really say what are the other

1222
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,560
costs on, say for example, the Mortal Kombat games or anything like that.

1223
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,560
But they look good, though.

1224
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,280
They have some screenshots actually online now of Mortal Kombat, and Rampart, and Super

1225
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,200
Sprint, stuff like that, so that's kind of cool.

1226
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,520
And then, I don't know what the hell this is, but apparently there's this homebrew program

1227
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:22,520
called Mini VMac for the DS, where apparently they're running Mac OS on a DS, which is so

1228
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,740
wrong, but okay.

1229
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:32,100
And then, of course, a PlayStation 3 ISO loader is being worked on right now, and hopefully

1230
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:40,840
it'll be done soon there in the testing phase, so piracy on the PlayStation 3 coming soon.

1231
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,720
I'm sure Sony's thrilled to hear that news.

1232
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,720
Oh yeah.

1233
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,760
DarkSakura, do you have anything for us, last minute?

1234
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,120
No, I just have my usual awesome.

1235
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,840
All right, well then I guess that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch

1236
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Radio.

1237
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:56,440
Hey guys, thanks so much for tuning in to us, downloading it, and supporting independent

1238
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,440
internet radio.

1239
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,280
We really appreciate it, and it is that support that keeps us going week after week.

1240
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,440
We'll see you back here next week with more Orange Launch Radio.

1241
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,240
I do believe there's some football game on TV, but we're not watching, so we'll be here

1242
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:12,160
Sunday Night Live, 6 o'clock Pacific, to talk about more games.

1243
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,300
So until then, this is Rob Roberts for DarkSakura and Loki saying, see you next time here on

1244
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,300
Orange Lounge Radio.

1245
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,300
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
