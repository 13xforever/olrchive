00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:19,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:21,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:27,340
[SPEAKER_06]: We are here on this lovely Sunday evening, January the 28th of 2007 for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to get into part B.

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:36,183
[SPEAKER_06]: My throat is feeling a little bit better, but I'm going to step out of the room for just a second to get some coffee out of my Hello Kitty coffee maker.

8
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:40,065
[SPEAKER_06]: For those who didn't listen to Part A, my throat's kind of bad tonight.

9
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:45,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to go get some more hot stuff to drink, and can you guys take care of some gaming news for a minute?

10
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:45,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

11
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I would really appreciate that.

12
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:47,768
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

13
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:56,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so starting things off, this week Microsoft had announced their earnings for their quarter, and of course...

14
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,227
[SPEAKER_07]: The profits were down, but at least the 360 revenues were up.

15
00:01:01,587 --> 00:01:17,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, unfortunately, Microsoft went back and revised their earnings statements, basically saying that their expected 360 shipments for 2007 and spring, they reduced it down from $15 million to $12 million.

16
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,498
[SPEAKER_07]: This is due to unsold inventories in stores.

17
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:26,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, you know, that big tower of 360s that you see in your Best Buys and your Game Stops,

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because of that, they are dropping their shipments amount because, you know, who needs to ship more units if there's tons in stores?

19
00:01:36,186 --> 00:01:43,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, and because of that, all these stocks from other companies have dropped a little bit as well because of that news.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not a big, you know, big surprise.

21
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:53,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the PlayStation 3 is kind of in the same boat right now where they have a ton of units in stores and no one's really buying them because there's not a lot of games out right now or it's too expensive.

22
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:54,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way...

23
00:01:56,394 --> 00:02:04,218
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the analysts, PJ McNeely, said video game publishers will be under pressure today after Microsoft cuts its life-to-date shipment.

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:13,083
[SPEAKER_07]: There is investor concern about reset of expectations around both the Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3.

25
00:02:13,743 --> 00:02:18,105
[SPEAKER_07]: So pretty much just, you know, I guess they're playing it safe.

26
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:20,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed all that.

27
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:21,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you repeat it?

28
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:22,794
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

29
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:32,477
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically Microsoft shipping or they're reducing their amount of shipments that they're going to be... No, I heard Microsoft's goal went down a little bit.

30
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:35,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can see the impact that's having on things as a whole.

31
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:39,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only down to me a few million, I guess.

32
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,860
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of bad, but they just have to sell the units that they have right now.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And trust me, those units will be gone once Halo 3 comes out.

34
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:48,322
[SPEAKER_07]: And even maybe Crackdown.

35
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:51,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Crackdown might sell a few... I don't know about selling units for beta, but

36
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:59,928
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, this is a report coming from QJ.net, speaking of the Xbox 360.

37
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,068
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a little bit of a hack.

38
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:10,730
[SPEAKER_06]: You can use this at your own risk, but apparently a hack has been released, the HDD hacker, that will allow you to use your hard drive, your own hard drive, with the Xbox 360.

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, keep in mind there are some limitations.

40
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:19,772
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only really use a Western Digital BEVS series and only a 20-gigabyte hard drive.

41
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:28,760
[SPEAKER_06]: But keep in mind, if you do it that way, a 20GB hard drive through Western Digital is going to be a hell of a lot cheaper than a regular Xbox 360 hard drive through Microsoft.

42
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,041
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I'm thinking... Actually, I'm sorry.

43
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:37,422
[SPEAKER_06]: The site goes on to say that once bigger Microsoft-certified hard drives come out, then you'll be able to use those with the tool.

44
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:39,143
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm thinking, no, you won't.

45
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:41,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft's very good about patching this shit as soon as they find it.

46
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:46,565
[SPEAKER_06]: And I bet you by this time next week, we'll see a patch roll out on live that'll prevent this.

47
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:49,386
[SPEAKER_06]: The next patch that goes out live will shut this thing out.

48
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:49,666
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

49
00:03:51,006 --> 00:04:01,831
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason why this does is actually there's information on the hard drive sector that's the same on all the hard drives because they have to be universal since they're working with all these different systems.

50
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:09,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically some sort of identified device type of thing that's stored in one of the sectors.

51
00:04:10,014 --> 00:04:13,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So all they do is basically mimic that on this hard drive.

52
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:16,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So all it thinks is that it's a legit hard drive.

53
00:04:17,197 --> 00:04:19,598
[SPEAKER_07]: So there would be no way to patch this.

54
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:21,345
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's a peripheral.

55
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:28,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be like if I took a controller for the 360 and I made it look like that's an official Microsoft controller.

56
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:32,207
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way for it to tell between whether this is real or not.

57
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:39,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well you follow the hack stuff more than I do, so I'll take your word for it, but this just seems like the kind of thing that Microsoft's usually all over.

58
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:40,749
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll take your word for it.

59
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:44,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like modifying firmware or anything like that, so I think that they wouldn't be able to patch this.

60
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

61
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,

62
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:57,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Going into things that have, well, I don't know, not quite yet having to do with the Xbox 360.

63
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:58,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sort of.

64
00:04:58,777 --> 00:04:59,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

65
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:00,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just rephrase this.

66
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,303
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all familiar with the Unreal Engine, right?

67
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:08,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

68
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:08,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

69
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:10,145
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been some good games coming out of that.

70
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:12,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess who's just licensed it?

71
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been licensed by Squeenix.

72
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:16,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

73
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

74
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:25,710
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically, there's a manager, I'm all tongue tied now, thank you, I blame you.

75
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:40,159
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a statement put out by the general manager of R&D at Square Enix that's Taku Murata saying that it will speed up the creation process and allow developers to spend

76
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,621
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

77
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

78
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this thought.

79
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew Nami says, Kingdom Hearts 3 using the Unreal Engine.

80
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:11,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be hot?

81
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:13,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a boner just thinking about it.

82
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding, just kidding.

83
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:16,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, that's pretty exciting.

84
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:18,269
[SPEAKER_06]: The Unreal Engine's pretty good.

85
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:23,693
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually a little bit more information regarding the Unreal Tournament itself.

86
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:29,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Unreal Tournament 2007 is now renamed as Unreal Tournament 3 and is going to be on Xbox 360.

87
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It was confirmed at Midway's Gamers Day in Las Vegas.

88
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:35,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

89
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:41,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be developed with the PC and PS3 versions.

90
00:06:42,426 --> 00:06:43,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a release later on this year.

91
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

92
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:48,871
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Unreal.

93
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,273
[SPEAKER_06]: You know one thing I do like about Unreal?

94
00:06:51,313 --> 00:06:55,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played a whole lot of it, but I did play it on the original Xbox because I bought it when it was like $20.

95
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:57,538
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking fast.

96
00:06:57,738 --> 00:06:59,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It is like one of the fastest shooters I've ever played.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,461
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazingly fast.

98
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:01,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

99
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:04,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Even just the first Unreal tournament was crazy.

100
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:07,865
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a game that gave me some freaking motion sickness right there.

101
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was going to say, you probably are not having much fun with those games with how fast they move.

102
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:17,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's also a little bit more as far as, not necessarily just the graphics, but different multiplayer modes.

103
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,852
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a voice-controlled AI and player-controlled vehicles.

104
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:32,916
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a conquest mode that will be a battle for eight teams on a map that's three times the size of the Deathmatch and Onslaught maps.

105
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:35,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

106
00:07:36,363 --> 00:07:48,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking about Square Enix here, NCSX has reported that Square Enix is going to be producing a collection of replica weapons called the Square Enix Master Arms Collection.

107
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:55,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically going to be some of the weapons from the Final Fantasy series and Keyblade from Kingdom Hearts.

108
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:59,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, they are not going to be full-size, so don't get your hopes up there.

109
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:09,454
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're going to range from 15 centimeters for Cerebus to 26 centimeters for Sephiroth's Gunblade.

110
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:13,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, there's four different blades to choose from.

111
00:08:13,755 --> 00:08:18,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, Cerebus, which I believe, I can't remember which Final Fantasy it is from.

112
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:22,517
[SPEAKER_07]: The Keyblade, of course, from Kingdom Hearts.

113
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:23,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Squall's Gunblade.

114
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:24,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that's Vincent's Gun.

115
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:25,650
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

116
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, I have school to pay for

117
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:07,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did it already go up?

118
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It already went up.

119
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a Playstation 3 so I don't know.

120
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:43,791
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently it went up and they did this whole little change there is that the Playstation 1 and 2 games now will run right and they'll look fine.

121
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:53,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you can also, they also did some other little things like you can set an image photo for a user ID and all this other little minor crap Korean keyboards and stuff you can use now.

122
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,296
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's weird though?

123
00:09:56,237 --> 00:10:00,398
[SPEAKER_07]: You know on your PSP how during the months they'll change colors in the background?

124
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:01,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well they...

125
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:06,958
[SPEAKER_07]: PS3 backgrounds will slowly fade from one color to another as time goes on through the month.

126
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:09,638
[SPEAKER_07]: It might start off black, and now it's yellow.

127
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:10,899
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of weird.

128
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:11,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, yellow?

129
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:12,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

130
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:14,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Not my favorite color.

131
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:19,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, you know, yellow is associated with aggression, so it's not my favorite either.

132
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's actually, though, a little bit more news coming out regarding an animated Castlevania 3 movie.

133
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Dracula's Curse movie.

134
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:39,596
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically looking, they're still in the early stages of their production.

135
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,818
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working on the visual development side of everything.

136
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:47,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So through February it's going to be mostly character creature design.

137
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,941
[SPEAKER_03]: They need background designers, background painters.

138
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:55,203
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually looking for artists to work with that.

139
00:10:55,243 --> 00:10:58,024
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've actually opened up positions in Southern California.

140
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,506
[SPEAKER_03]: If you actually want to submit

141
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:09,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Your portfolio to them, you can actually email at Belmont at CastlevaniaDraculasCursed.com I think that's pretty cool.

142
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking for artists.

143
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:12,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us some work.

144
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see that when it comes out.

145
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:26,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, unfortunately, there have been some other bad vampire movies, including Blood Rain, which is up for six Razzies.

146
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:39,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It's received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst Supporting Actress, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay.

147
00:11:39,718 --> 00:11:46,280
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, I guess, good news if you really hate BloodRayne.

148
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Although if you do hate BloodRayne, you would probably be disappointed to know that he's planning a sequel.

149
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:55,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, I think, already in production, so that kind of sucks.

150
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:59,691
[SPEAKER_07]: One other movie that he has coming out, though, pretty soon is going to be Postal.

151
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:10,838
[SPEAKER_07]: And IGN had some news from that, actually, talking about some of the things that are going to be offending people, including such wonderful things as full-frontal nudity from NewsRadio's Dave Foley.

152
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:14,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, he's going to be playing some crazy cult leader.

153
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:18,222
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's one scene... Hooray?

154
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:23,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I realize you guys know I'm gay and all, but I'm not thrilled to hear about that.

155
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:24,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

156
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:26,315
[SPEAKER_06]: He's kind of old.

157
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:36,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, Dave Foley's character in the production is called Uncle Dave and is a twisted cult leader who uses his religious doctrine to keep his subjects in a constant state of servitude.

158
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,743
[SPEAKER_07]: And he exploits this by luring them into orgies and other debauchery.

159
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:50,766
[SPEAKER_07]: It says in the scenes that they saw, Foley was dressed in an open robe, and they mean open, wandering around the room barking orders.

160
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:53,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of the scene, he takes a crap on camera.

161
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:55,065
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the kind of movie.

162
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,506
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

163
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Other fun stuff about this movie, though.

164
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:00,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

165
00:13:00,628 --> 00:13:04,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about your career going downhill after news radio going off.

166
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got to be made up.

167
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

168
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:13,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Other stuff that they have in the movie, it says there's stuff about 9-11.

169
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:16,277
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually make fun of 9-11.

170
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:21,580
[SPEAKER_07]: They make fun of school shootings, including, I guess there was one scene that says...

171
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,524
[SPEAKER_07]: This sounds like the dumbest fucking thing in the world.

172
00:13:25,544 --> 00:13:26,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously.

173
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:32,027
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a difference between parody that's somewhat amusing and this just sounds like stupid after stupid after stupid.

174
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:32,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so...

175
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be interesting, I guess.

176
00:13:55,592 --> 00:13:55,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

177
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting's a good word to define it, I suppose.

178
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:58,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see it, though.

179
00:13:58,995 --> 00:13:59,995
[SPEAKER_07]: I will definitely go see it.

180
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:00,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

181
00:14:01,016 --> 00:14:01,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun.

182
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:02,737
[SPEAKER_06]: By yourself.

183
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:04,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you can talk Nellie into going.

184
00:14:06,075 --> 00:14:10,538
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, one thing we didn't go over in Part A were the release dates.

185
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:13,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though Loki gave us some exclusives, we didn't talk about what's coming out this week.

186
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,162
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to start it off talking about Japanese release dates, of which, honestly, folks, there's not a whole lot.

187
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:25,207
[SPEAKER_06]: January was a dry month for us over here in the U.S., and February, at least the beginning part of it, looks to be a bit slow over there in Japan.

188
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:30,810
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have J-League Pro Soccer Club Otsukuru 5 coming out.

189
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,261
[SPEAKER_06]: on February 1st.

190
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:39,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Zero Shikikan Josentukeni, which is Best Hits from Taito.

191
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:41,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure if that's a game that's actually out over here.

192
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:46,849
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like some type of old school B-52 type bomber game.

193
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this is a game they have over here.

194
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Twin Cobra?

195
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

196
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:56,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

197
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:56,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the title?

198
00:14:57,755 --> 00:15:04,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero, Shikikan, Josentokini Yeah, whatever.

199
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,021
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the best hits anyway.

200
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:06,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already out.

201
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going in to be a little bit cheaper.

202
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.

203
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,325
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we have over on the Nintendo DS?

204
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:13,986
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a couple things coming out on the DS.

205
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:25,113
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Monster House, which I suppose is a release a lot of folks are looking forward to, as well as Bokujo Monogatari Kimi to Sodatsu Shima coming out from Marvelous Entertainment.

206
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:26,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Nappishitam no Hakko

207
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:47,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Arthur and the Invisibles for PS2, DS, PC, Game Boy Advance

208
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:21,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Contact on DS, also Dungeon Siege, Throne of Agony on PSP, Europa Universalis 3 on PC, Ghost Rider on Xbox, NFL Street 3 going to be on PSP and PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis Collection, PS2, PSP, and on the 5th Galactic Civilizations 2, but that's coming out later.

209
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Quest VIII Battle Stations Midway PC, Vanguard Saga of Heroes

210
00:16:52,888 --> 00:17:10,999
[SPEAKER_07]: and, um, let's see here, Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3, uh, Fusion, I don't know, Fusion Frenzy 2 on Xbox 360, uh, City Life World Edition on the PC, and Monopoly Here and Now on the PC.

211
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, that's about it for this week at least.

212
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:21,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, uh, I wanted to mention this, and, uh, this is a little bit embarrassing because the, uh, oh, no, there it is.

213
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:21,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, we got it.

214
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:24,221
[SPEAKER_06]: The link wasn't working previously for some reason.

215
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:30,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trying to hit Blizzard Entertainment to look at this press release that talks about World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade.

216
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:32,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you know that that game just came out earlier this month.

217
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:33,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, get this.

218
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: It sold 2.4 million copies in the first 24 hours.

219
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:44,085
[SPEAKER_06]: It was released simultaneously in North America, Europe, Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia.

220
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:48,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And then January 17th, Australia and New Zealand, just the day after.

221
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Which actually would, because they're on the other side of the dateline.

222
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:51,726
[SPEAKER_06]: But never mind.

223
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:56,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Regardless, they came out and sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours.

224
00:17:57,093 --> 00:18:02,838
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty impressive and certainly shattered any existing PC game records that were already out there.

225
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:06,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of World of Warcraft addicts out there in the world, apparently.

226
00:18:07,342 --> 00:18:09,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they ignoring their babies?

227
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:10,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

228
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:15,409
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that only listen to us during the podcast, we have a bonus segment we do here live.

229
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:16,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Moore-Hamey

230
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have not bought the expansion.

231
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,872
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't be buying it until I hit level 40.

232
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:39,232
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I promised myself.

233
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:39,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

234
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:01,934
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, I think, other MMOs that might be pulling people's addiction.

235
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:05,297
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Lord of the Rings MMO actually has a date.

236
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:14,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Lord of the Rings Shadow of Angmar to be released in Europe on the 24th of April, according to Codemasters.

237
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:21,111
[SPEAKER_03]: The price of it actually is going to be a special pre-order rate.

238
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:27,262
[SPEAKER_03]: for $99.99 that has a lifetime membership instead of a subscription fee.

239
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:31,766
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can either do that or pay £5.99 a month for a six month package.

240
00:19:38,711 --> 00:20:07,641
[SPEAKER_03]: but the advantage of pre-ordering it gives you early access to the game for 10 days you can use a pre-launch character in the full game so basically whatever you make during this little beta is yours to hold on to you get a unique in-game bonus item six Lord of the Rings online stickers and a special window sticker yeah it seems kind of interesting I don't know it's

241
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,171
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many MMOs out there, really.

242
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:11,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Amen!

243
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:45,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Also though, just to let you know, I'm on the US site for this Lord of the Rings game.

244
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:56,453
[SPEAKER_03]: For the pre-order special that they're having on that one, I'm trying to scroll down on it, it's still loading.

245
00:20:56,473 --> 00:20:58,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me read a couple of comments.

246
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,816
[SPEAKER_03]: When you pre-order it, you have $199 for the lifetime thing, or $999 monthly.

247
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:07,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Early Access, you keep your launch care.

248
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:08,356
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing, really.

249
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:12,957
[SPEAKER_03]: You get an enchanted Cloak of Regeneration and a Ring of Agility.

250
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:15,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I like regenerating.

251
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,699
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to read some of these other interesting comments.

252
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:25,381
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says, Dear Blizzard, since you have all this money, you wouldn't mind putting StarCraft on DS, would you?

253
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:31,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And Michael Doy is going to make a fan with Jamie here saying, I want a Doctor Who MMO.

254
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:32,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah!

255
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:33,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that coming.

256
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:36,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I might sign up for the beta for this, though.

257
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:42,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so before Doctor Who MMO, you're going to see something else coming from BBC.

258
00:21:43,194 --> 00:21:47,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be CBBC, their kids' property.

259
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:51,117
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be creating an MMO based on that called CBBC World.

260
00:21:51,818 --> 00:22:03,003
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be aimed at kids ages 7 to 12, and it's going to kind of just be your online MMO for kids, just like Toontown, Disney thing over here.

261
00:22:05,506 --> 00:22:11,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's gonna have a bunch of, like, you know, custom avatars, you know, minigames, music videos.

262
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:17,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Completely lame for anybody over the age of 12, but Jamie will still be signed up to play.

263
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:23,499
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's gonna be, like, what, Gaia Online or something, which I quit in, you know, a day, because it was boring.

264
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:31,786
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll still play it, because, like, if it's BBC related, it might remotely have a Doctor Who reference in it, and you'll be like... If someone tells me for sure there's a Doctor Who reference, I'll sign up.

265
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:32,466
[SPEAKER_06]: See, see.

266
00:22:32,806 --> 00:22:33,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Chat room, lie to her.

267
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:34,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be funny.

268
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:34,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

269
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:39,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But I only want our UK listeners to tell me.

270
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:40,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine.

271
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:45,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, on a completely unrelated note, that doesn't even have to do with video games, but I think it's kind of funny regarding the BBC.

272
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:54,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I read on some reality TV news site, don't ask me what I was doing reading it, but I was, that the BBC is doing like a Harry Potter reality show.

273
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,062
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not called Harry Potter, but they're sending kids to magic school.

274
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:03,125
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's going to be like a reality show for kids in magic school and they actually have to do magic tricks.

275
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:04,326
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's magic school.

276
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:05,367
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean devil school?

277
00:23:05,387 --> 00:23:06,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I get it, I get it.

278
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:06,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what you did there.

279
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:09,129
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, it sounds really cheesy.

280
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:13,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope they bring the show over to America because it would be a hoot.

281
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:15,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Magic school.

282
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they get a lot of shows from Britain over here.

283
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:21,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And it should be hosted by David Copperfield because he's washed up anyway.

284
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,616
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell ever happened to David Copperfield?

285
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,437
[SPEAKER_06]: He just disappeared.

286
00:23:25,157 --> 00:23:26,438
[SPEAKER_06]: He just made himself disappear.

287
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:33,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one game that disappeared but made a hell of a comeback moving into some non-MMO PC gaming news, Sam & Max.

288
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:36,378
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they were gone for a long, long time, and then they came back.

289
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:40,862
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting new life thanks to GameTap and, you know, some of the other distribution methods they're doing.

290
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:45,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 1, Culture Shock for Sam & Max came out in October of 06.

291
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:52,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 2 came out December of 06, and now Episode 3 just came out on GameTap just this past week.

292
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,874
[SPEAKER_06]: It's titled The Mole, The Mob, and The Meatball.

293
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:58,180
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the third part of a six-part series.

294
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,041
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I understand, I have yet to play these games myself.

295
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:01,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I really need to.

296
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:02,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a GameTap subscription.

297
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to put down the WoW and get into these games.

298
00:24:04,962 --> 00:24:08,023
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I understand, none of these episodes are really long.

299
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:12,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you'll play them for four hours, depending on how much you play.

300
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,906
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have to explore every nook and cranny or not.

301
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:19,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But it sounds kind of interesting.

302
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:23,969
[SPEAKER_06]: You often hear about these episodic gaming, but...

303
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:27,017
[SPEAKER_06]: They kind of produce one or two episodes, then that's it.

304
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of nice to see Sam and Max keep going at it and being very successful.

305
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,681
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've heard nothing but raves about the game.

306
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:41,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So I promise you I will play Sam and Max at least part one, maybe all the way through part three, depending on how I enjoy it, before the month's over, which doesn't give me much time.

307
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:45,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that series will run a little longer than the cartoon series that they had.

308
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can see the cartoon series on GameTap, for whatever it's worth.

309
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:49,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, cool.

310
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:50,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

311
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:56,121
[SPEAKER_03]: For our PC gamers, there's a bit of sad news.

312
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:00,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Age of Conan has been delayed even longer.

313
00:25:00,404 --> 00:25:02,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be out in October.

314
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually will ship October 30th.

315
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:10,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox 360 version is going to be in 2008, so it'll be after that.

316
00:25:13,934 --> 00:25:15,194
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks interesting.

317
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:18,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty, I guess.

318
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,571
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

319
00:25:40,934 --> 00:25:41,774
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

320
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:07,540
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck did that have to do with anything we were just talking about?

321
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw an ad for a Tycoon game and I was thinking PC stuff.

322
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'd be awesome.

323
00:26:14,123 --> 00:26:15,985
[SPEAKER_07]: There could be some major money made there.

324
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:18,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it should come out in the DS.

325
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:23,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more curveballs you want to throw at us?

326
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:26,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if, you know, you're not into porn Tycoon or, you know,

327
00:26:28,214 --> 00:26:28,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Age of Conan.

328
00:26:29,335 --> 00:26:32,718
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be interested in Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2 for the PC.

329
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:37,922
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be coming out day and date with the Xbox 360 version which is March 9th.

330
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:49,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to feature some more multiplayer stuff as well as up to 32 players online and more game modes including the standard deathmatch co-op and stuff.

331
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:51,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus it's just going to have a whole new storyline.

332
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:56,536
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest the game looked originally kind of like the first one a lot but

333
00:26:57,242 --> 00:27:09,726
[SPEAKER_07]: The storyline sounds pretty interesting, almost like they're going to do, I want to say there's like Mexicans invading Texas or something, and some sort of, like they have to stave off some civil war over Mexico and stuff.

334
00:27:09,746 --> 00:27:12,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it was a fun game the first time around.

335
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I cheated the whole way through it, by the way.

336
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:15,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Surprise.

337
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:16,809
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun, though.

338
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:19,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Infinite grenade launchers are awesome.

339
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:24,613
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I knew you and your random porn tycoon outburst would stir chat.

340
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:25,774
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on in our chat room?

341
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:30,034
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says, Loki just had his what if it snowed in San Francisco moment.

342
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:32,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Meklar says, porn tycoon.

343
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:33,955
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, build a fluffer room.

344
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:36,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the fluffers are an important part of pornography.

345
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:40,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And then DarkTetsuya says, I thought they made that.

346
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,937
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called Playboy Mansion.

347
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:43,637
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Playboy Mansion was lame.

348
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:47,856
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you improve on Playboy Mansion for Porn Tycoon?

349
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:50,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually make it cool and not Playboy.

350
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:52,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Playboy, to be honest, just sucks.

351
00:27:52,998 --> 00:27:56,040
[SPEAKER_07]: They just want to be X-rated, but they're too classy for that shit.

352
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if it was like, you know, Penthouse Mansion or something like that, that'd be a little step in the right direction there.

353
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:04,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Joshi16 says, Neverland Ranch Tycoon.

354
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:05,805
[SPEAKER_06]: One person buys it.

355
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:06,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess who?

356
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:09,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter Pan?

357
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:13,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, um...

358
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:15,324
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

359
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So, have you guys seen this list already?

360
00:28:40,482 --> 00:28:42,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, Jamie, have you guys seen the list already?

361
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:42,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

362
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:44,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Loki, Jamie, have you read this list already?

363
00:28:44,926 --> 00:28:46,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what would you think would be on this list?

364
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:48,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides Tomb Raider, which is up on the screen right now.

365
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:54,374
[SPEAKER_06]: What games do you think, number 7 is Tomb Raider, what series do you think have just been run into the ground?

366
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:56,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Remakes of Final Fantasy 7.

367
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:59,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well let's see if it shows up.

368
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:02,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, number 7 is Tomb Raider.

369
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:03,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Number 6 is Mega Man.

370
00:29:04,557 --> 00:29:10,441
[SPEAKER_06]: because, I mean, really, I mean, there's been all those stinking Battle Network games, but there was, you know, there was never really a Mega Man 9.

371
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:16,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Man X games kind of ended in 2004, and so, you know, Mega Man's just kind of been done to death.

372
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,486
[SPEAKER_06]: They need a resurgence of Mega Man, I think.

373
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful Joe is at number five, which I think is an interesting selection.

374
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,070
[SPEAKER_07]: They had, like, two or three games for that series.

375
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,191
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hardly running for the game.

376
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,512
[SPEAKER_07]: But were any of them as good as the first one?

377
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,855
[SPEAKER_07]: But they, you know, to be honest, though, they may have not been as good as the first one, but...

378
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:35,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you have to kind of take off to run it into the ground, you know what I mean?

379
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:39,143
[SPEAKER_06]: GamesRadar cites Red Hot Rumble, which was a Smash Bros.

380
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:43,147
[SPEAKER_06]: type fighter game that had beautiful Joe characters in it.

381
00:29:43,227 --> 00:29:44,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four was Dynasty Warriors.

382
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:49,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single Dynasty Warriors game is exactly the same as the one before it.

383
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:54,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they keep doing this fucking Empire shit, which is exactly the same game all over again.

384
00:29:54,616 --> 00:30:00,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three is Tenchu, and they cite the PSP version, as this has just been done too much now.

385
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:01,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

386
00:30:01,816 --> 00:30:04,137
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that game, there's still not that many games.

387
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:05,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two is Spy Hunter.

388
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:06,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with this.

389
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:08,961
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been like three games in that series.

390
00:30:09,261 --> 00:30:12,423
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, it was gone for the longest time.

391
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:20,609
[SPEAKER_06]: You had Spy Hunter and then a forgettable sequel in the arcades, and then it was gone forever, and then suddenly Midway decided to make this resurgence out of it, and it's not been anything to scream about.

392
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:21,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

393
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:23,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

394
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:25,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's why they say they run into the ground.

395
00:30:25,713 --> 00:30:29,536
[SPEAKER_06]: They cite Spy Hunter 2 and Spy Hunter Nowhere to Run.

396
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:59,578
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 games by 3 different developers the number 1 series they say has been run into the ground Sonic the Hedgehog the number 1 series and of course they cite the GBA port of the original that was god awful in 2006 Rivals and Riders which weren't that great of course this new one that's god awful they say the last truly good Sonic game according to GamesRadar Sonic Rush back in 2005 was the last good one you know what I think is interesting though

397
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:06,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of folks out there think we're Nintendo fanboys and girls here on this program, and to some extent, you know, we are a little bit.

398
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:10,031
[SPEAKER_06]: But hasn't Mario had some pretty shitty games, too?

399
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:10,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

400
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:12,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever play Mario is Missing?

401
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,454
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a PC game, though.

402
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:17,516
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there was a version on Super Nintendo that was pretty awful.

403
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:19,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Luigi's Mansion, not that great.

404
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,100
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people didn't like Mario Sunshine.

405
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was pretty good myself, but a lot of folks didn't like it for whatever reason.

406
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:27,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And the re-release over and over.

407
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:29,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is Mario getting a buy out of all this?

408
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:30,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess...

409
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:31,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario 64, Donkey Kong

410
00:31:47,677 --> 00:31:49,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that Mario vs. Donkey Kong.

411
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:50,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, those games are okay.

412
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,342
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I meant, like, just Donkey Kong stuff.

413
00:31:52,362 --> 00:31:54,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the Donkey Kong Country... Donkey Kong Country got ran into the ground.

414
00:31:54,844 --> 00:31:59,489
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay, but then, like, they had the stupid fucking bongo shit, and then... I don't know.

415
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:00,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, the bongo games were interesting.

416
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:09,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but then they have those other ones where you had to, like, you know, use the bongos to, like, move up a, like... What was that one where you had to basically just use the L and R buttons on it?

417
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:10,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

418
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:11,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I think...

419
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:14,058
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the franchises out there kind of suck.

420
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:16,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, Ranma made a good one that these guys left off the list.

421
00:32:17,138 --> 00:32:18,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget Spyro.

422
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:21,659
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great one that should have been on the list.

423
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Good catch, Ranma.

424
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Crash Bandicoot.

425
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are both really good ones.

426
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:29,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else do we have?

427
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says, yeah, but the last real Mario game came out 11 years ago.

428
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:34,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that would depend on what you consider a real Mario game.

429
00:32:34,182 --> 00:32:34,682
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Rampage?

430
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:36,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a good one, too.

431
00:32:37,943 --> 00:32:39,123
[SPEAKER_06]: See, we should come up with our own list.

432
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:41,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, JeremyTodd1 says Metal Slug.

433
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:43,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually.

434
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:45,326
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Contra?

435
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:48,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while since we had a Contra game, hasn't it?

436
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:49,847
[SPEAKER_06]: No, last year.

437
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:50,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, besides the arcade.

438
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:52,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

439
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:52,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I meant like 2005.

440
00:32:53,468 --> 00:32:57,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we had Shattered... Wait, not Shattered Soldier.

441
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:01,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, I don't remember the last one.

442
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Vinpower says, I admit, I had a blast with the Mario is Missing games.

443
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:05,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed it.

444
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:06,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninja Turtle games.

445
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:08,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good one.

446
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:10,372
[SPEAKER_06]: See, we got some really good ones here.

447
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,230
[SPEAKER_06]: But the list wasn't so bad as it was.

448
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,371
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

449
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:18,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, another thing that's not so bad is reading your emails that we get every week.

450
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:19,213
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, we rather enjoy it.

451
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And DarkSakura is queen of the mailbag.

452
00:33:21,174 --> 00:33:28,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you send your emails to mailbag at orangelaunchreader.com, DarkSakura will read and often respond to your emails and pick some of her favorites to read here on the program.

453
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:33,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, because we do get quite a few letters, we can't read them all, but we can try.

454
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So DarkSakura is going to open up the mailbag and dive on in and see what we've got to read this week.

455
00:33:39,002 --> 00:33:40,463
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?

456
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:46,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Two emails.

457
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:48,458
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it?

458
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:49,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

459
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:50,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, let's do it.

460
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:51,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

461
00:33:52,691 --> 00:33:59,453
[SPEAKER_03]: First one, SalutationsOLRCast, I just had a question about the Nintendo Wii, and if its games contain region coding, thanks for reading this.

462
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:04,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I don't know if you guys heard about this article, but someone tried to electrocute themselves with an arcade machine.

463
00:34:05,254 --> 00:34:11,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Their Pac-Man high score was beaten, and he claimed that he had nothing left to live for, so he attempted suicide with a Pac-Man machine.

464
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:12,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty weird, though.

465
00:34:12,776 --> 00:34:15,577
[SPEAKER_03]: He just comes from Zenith.

466
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:18,458
[SPEAKER_07]: He should have just tipped the machine over on himself.

467
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That wouldn't kill anybody.

468
00:34:20,118 --> 00:34:21,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had an arcade machine fall on me.

469
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:26,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, first of all, um... Did it hit you in the head?

470
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:29,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that might explain some stuff.

471
00:34:30,826 --> 00:34:32,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Teasing, just heart?

472
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:34,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm letting you buy me dinner.

473
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,768
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make it up to me with potato pancakes.

474
00:34:37,788 --> 00:34:38,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Fat chance.

475
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:40,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my car's dead.

476
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:44,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, um, as for the, the, uh... Would you like, would you like a nice cup?

477
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:46,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like me to bring you a cup of wah?

478
00:34:47,032 --> 00:34:49,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I'm trying to do emails, so you can shut up, okay?

479
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:52,454
[SPEAKER_03]: All own...

480
00:34:54,215 --> 00:35:18,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie So at any rate, the Nintendo Wii is definitely region coded So yeah, but they're working on it, they're working on it And also about someone killing themselves over a score Darwin loves them Sorry, that type of person should be removed from the dream pool

481
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:31,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving forward to the next and last email, pretty long one, coming to us from someone who has not signed the email, so I'm just going to say JCK.

482
00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:34,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey guys, great show.

483
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:38,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to give some feedback to two news items on last week's show.

484
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:43,831
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dallas Area TV Network's WFAA has reported on the PS3 and Wii as a giveaway to porn.

485
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, gateway to porn.

486
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:47,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And the New York State bill... Really?

487
00:35:47,153 --> 00:35:48,975
[SPEAKER_06]: They're giving away porn on the PS3?

488
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:49,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'll buy one.

489
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Rob, shut up.

490
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:58,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And the New York State bill A00547 and later the A02024 prohibiting the sale of certain games to minors.

491
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to read the email though if you really want to talk?

492
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,409
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I'm fine.

493
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go get more coffee for my Hello Kitty maker.

494
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:32,750
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the ones who seek to censor and control every content distribution chain.

495
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:40,714
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that the world cannot be made safe, even if we could agree on what safe is without oppressing sub-subculture somewhere.

496
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:44,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It is impossible for any of us to remake the world in our own image.

497
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:45,156
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to accept that...

498
00:36:45,785 --> 00:36:54,372
[SPEAKER_03]: that we don't like exist, that our children will stumble onto them if we don't shelter them or otherwise prepare them for that initial contact.

499
00:36:54,793 --> 00:37:00,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I may not agree with the religious conservatives who homeschool their kids and filter their TV, but at least they're active parents.

500
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:03,801
[SPEAKER_03]: There are legal issues that surround the New York bills.

501
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:06,243
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, who decides what is objectionable?

502
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:09,405
[SPEAKER_03]: The ESRB and MPAA are private industry bodies.

503
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:13,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot pass a law that deputizes these private bodies to rate things

504
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:14,497
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

505
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:36,660
[SPEAKER_03]: and PAA ratings and the gaming industry chooses to submit to the ESRB.

506
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:46,928
[SPEAKER_03]: The public pressure is on retail distribution chains to comply with what forces the content creators to adhere which is why every major game retailer already checks ID.

507
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,910
[SPEAKER_03]: The system works and there's no reason to change it.

508
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:52,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the end of the email.

509
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:54,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

510
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:56,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I got nothing.

511
00:37:57,957 --> 00:37:59,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that that's pretty...

512
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:01,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to say yeah.

513
00:38:02,257 --> 00:38:13,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I agree with... If the government really... And see, this is... I have a whole problem with the government being way too involved in our personal lives.

514
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:28,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it is unreasonable to expect somebody else to protect their children from...

515
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:30,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

516
00:38:49,857 --> 00:39:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: The reference to the homeschool religious fundamentalist, a friend of my friends that I met here when I moved out to California, she had been so sheltered homeschooled.

517
00:39:03,786 --> 00:39:14,174
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually didn't go to school until she was in high school and thought that oral sex was talking about sex.

518
00:39:17,768 --> 00:39:19,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew someone who thought the F word was fart.

519
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:33,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when confronted with the reality of their ignorance, you know, who's to blame but their parents, you know, keeping them from the stuff that's going on in the real world.

520
00:39:33,514 --> 00:39:43,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And to go back to the statement regarding needing a governmental body to participate with a government-controlled law.

521
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:46,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess it's the government-controlled.

522
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,880
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not redundant.

523
00:39:47,378 --> 00:40:03,966
[SPEAKER_03]: But I understand the logic in that, but I still think that if we have a private party that is not involved in the government, we are likely to get less, I would say, bias.

524
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:06,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, our government is bought and paid for.

525
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:09,709
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for every...

526
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:21,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Person that you elect into government positions, there's a lobbyist behind them paying lots of money for them to say, you know, I think that cigarettes are okay.

527
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:24,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that why Travis is running for president?

528
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

529
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:28,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know either.

530
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:29,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just putting that out there.

531
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:36,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I actually think that it is better for us to have that separation with those facilities and the government.

532
00:40:37,248 --> 00:40:39,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the law is unnecessary, and I agree, unenforceable.

533
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,972
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it's current incarnation.

534
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:44,053
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

535
00:40:44,073 --> 00:40:47,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I read through the email while you were ranting there, and it was well thought out.

536
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I like getting those thoughtful emails.

537
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:52,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when people with brains email us.

538
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:52,777
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

539
00:40:53,097 --> 00:40:55,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should email us to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

540
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:56,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And please be smart.

541
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dude, we got another email just as I was closing the box.

542
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:03,702
[SPEAKER_06]: They're already smart because they listen to this program.

543
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:05,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read this now.

544
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:06,223
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this?

545
00:41:06,243 --> 00:41:07,163
[SPEAKER_03]: This is by Nintendomaniac64.

546
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:07,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

547
00:41:08,686 --> 00:41:13,871
[SPEAKER_03]: WorthOfThousandWords.com, an entry into this Internet Porn Tycoon.

548
00:41:15,032 --> 00:41:15,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I get it.

549
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,854
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got a picture of that.

550
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:21,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody had already done this on this WorthOfThousand.com.

551
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody photoshopped Railroad Tycoon and says, Internet Porn Tycoon.

552
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:24,761
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

553
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:25,962
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.

554
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:28,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you for sharing that with us, Nintendo Maniacs.

555
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:29,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it's not real.

556
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:31,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

557
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:33,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can only hope.

558
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:34,169
[SPEAKER_03]: By MicroProbe.

559
00:41:34,229 --> 00:41:34,970
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.

560
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:38,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, MicroProse was the one that made it originally.

561
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:39,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what they did there.

562
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:41,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, Photoshop!

563
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:49,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so in the past, PlayStation Portable Firmware has been defeated by Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.

564
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:56,862
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, you know, Sony went and apparently fixed the hole, or so they thought.

565
00:41:57,955 --> 00:42:06,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, people have found another way using Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, one of the original copies, that you can once again break the firmware.

566
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:08,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And what have they done?

567
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:09,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, they've done it.

568
00:42:09,398 --> 00:42:18,500
[SPEAKER_07]: They've made their wonderful Hello World proof of concept thing, and even today, which just got released, a downgrader for firmware 3.03.

569
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,740
[SPEAKER_07]: So try as you might, Sony, you'll just never win.

570
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Never, ever.

571
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:23,821
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

572
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:27,415
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why consoles shouldn't have firmwares.

573
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:32,279
[SPEAKER_07]: They should just be good to go instead of having to upgrade.

574
00:42:32,379 --> 00:42:34,420
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the big deal about homebrew on the PSP anyway?

575
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really that bad?

576
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:38,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really killing families across America?

577
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:40,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really something that has to be prevented at all costs?

578
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:41,425
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

579
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:48,830
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they're encouraging it on the PlayStation 3, but that's still when people are going to pirate the, you know, they're going to break the firmware to pirate shit, so.

580
00:42:49,091 --> 00:42:53,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I was reading somewhere else that HD DVD, of course, you know, they finally had to admit that, yes, it's been cracked.

581
00:42:54,454 --> 00:42:54,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

582
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:55,215
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

583
00:42:55,455 --> 00:42:57,517
[SPEAKER_03]: This kick to your ass is courtesy of DMN.

584
00:42:58,338 --> 00:42:58,559
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

585
00:42:59,440 --> 00:42:59,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

586
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:10,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell DMN to go suck on a... Anyway, I wanted to just say really quickly, and then we're going to get into the Skype line and hear what you guys have to say and play a voicemail.

587
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:12,414
[SPEAKER_06]: We got one voicemail this week that's pretty interesting.

588
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:13,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you guys to hear it.

589
00:43:13,655 --> 00:43:15,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say this real quickly.

590
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:15,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember...

591
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,101
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

592
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:41,689
[SPEAKER_03]: and Stingus.

593
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they die when they sting you.

594
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:45,512
[SPEAKER_06]: If you love bees, check out the site.

595
00:43:45,572 --> 00:43:46,933
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ilovebees.com.

596
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:47,894
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

597
00:43:48,074 --> 00:43:51,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into the Skype line and take some of your calls here live on Orange Lounge Radio.

598
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:54,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, I want to play a voicemail that came into our line this week.

599
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, we always invite your voicemails on any topic.

600
00:43:57,603 --> 00:44:01,506
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.

601
00:44:01,746 --> 00:44:03,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Or for those of you guys outside the U.S.

602
00:44:03,748 --> 00:44:06,931
[SPEAKER_06]: or Canada where that number is toll free, you can always give us a call on the Skype line at

603
00:44:07,165 --> 00:44:10,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Just download Skype and call username OrangeLoungeRadio.

604
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:10,886
[SPEAKER_06]: That's us.

605
00:44:10,986 --> 00:44:12,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can leave us a message throughout the week.

606
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:15,588
[SPEAKER_06]: But keep in mind, if you call right now, you're probably going to get on the Skype line.

607
00:44:15,608 --> 00:44:16,468
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take you live on air.

608
00:44:16,508 --> 00:44:20,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're the type that likes to formulate your thoughts first and then leave us a voicemail, you can do that.

609
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Or sometimes we get other craziness on our voicemail line.

610
00:44:24,271 --> 00:44:25,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean craziness.

611
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:27,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So check this out because this is pretty crazy.

612
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:32,234
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might have to listen kind of carefully because they talk fast because you can definitely sense there's a lot of excitement in the room.

613
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:32,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So check this out.

614
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:41,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Rob, it's me, I just finished on the Freezpop concert, it was awesome, I have a little surprise for you, hold on.

615
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:52,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo Rob, this is Sean from Freezpop, what's going on man, I'm just chatting, we're like, wait, is he going to show up tonight, we don't know, is he going to fly in, I don't know, is he going to fly in tonight, I don't know, we're looking for like helicopters, you're not here.

616
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:59,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, this is Sean from Freezpop, hope you're doing well, rock out, good times, guitar hero, fun times, anime, good times, all around you.

617
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:02,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Freezpop, here's Adam again, he's got something he has to say.

618
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:13,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me translate because those guys talked faster than the Micro Machines guy.

619
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:22,202
[SPEAKER_06]: That apparently was Sean from Freeze Pop leaving the message because Ranma went to the concert in New York City the other night and got them to leave a message.

620
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

621
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:29,133
[SPEAKER_06]: See, sometimes we get craziness on the voicemail line.

622
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:34,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So I encourage you folks, program the 877-GAME-OLR into your cell phone.

623
00:45:34,394 --> 00:45:46,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you come across internet celebrities such as this guy from Freeze Pop, then you should have them call in and leave us crazy voicemails because, you know, that's fun.

624
00:45:47,538 --> 00:45:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

625
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:50,140
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to open up our Skype line.

626
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,063
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR or it's username Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

627
00:45:56,083 --> 00:46:02,687
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to offer up you guys to interact with our program here on Orange Lounge Radio because, you know, it doesn't have to be all about us.

628
00:46:03,288 --> 00:46:04,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to some extent.

629
00:46:04,268 --> 00:46:04,909
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be all about me.

630
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:08,971
[SPEAKER_06]: To some extent it does have to be all about us, but we want it to be about you guys as well.

631
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:12,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So give us a call right now on the Skype line and we'll take some calls.

632
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:15,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start off with this call tonight.

633
00:46:16,215 --> 00:46:17,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

634
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:17,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

635
00:46:19,107 --> 00:46:21,729
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DMN sans really crappy microphone.

636
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:24,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, DMN sans really crappy microphone.

637
00:46:24,371 --> 00:46:26,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm going to kick your ass next time I see you.

638
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:28,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring it, motherfucker.

639
00:46:28,714 --> 00:46:29,075
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

640
00:46:31,677 --> 00:46:31,897
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

641
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:33,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow, I'm just reading in the chatroom.

642
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:39,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, 2DX Gold is supposed to be at Konami Gamers Day, which we're going to next week.

643
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:40,163
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty hot.

644
00:46:40,203 --> 00:46:40,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

645
00:46:41,204 --> 00:46:42,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the hell that came from.

646
00:46:42,505 --> 00:46:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody just blurted that out in chat.

647
00:46:45,327 --> 00:46:46,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Can somebody back that up?

648
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,409
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't doubt it.

649
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:48,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, I see.

650
00:46:48,614 --> 00:46:51,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Meklar, oh, and 2DXGold is going over to America.

651
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:52,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Left the UK a day ago.

652
00:46:52,115 --> 00:46:53,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure where it's going, though.

653
00:46:53,555 --> 00:46:55,556
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys got any big conventions or game shows soon?

654
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jason put it together that it must be coming over to Konami Gamers Day.

655
00:46:59,077 --> 00:46:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty hot.

656
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:00,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming to SakuraCon.

657
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:01,237
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where it's going.

658
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:02,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so playing the Ghostbusters song.

659
00:47:02,678 --> 00:47:03,458
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

660
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:03,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

661
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:04,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going to happen.

662
00:47:04,878 --> 00:47:07,179
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have a full report on Konami Gamers Day next week.

663
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,379
[SPEAKER_06]: And keep an eye on our website.

664
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:09,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday and Friday.

665
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:18,803
[SPEAKER_06]: All the news that we get there is embargoed until a certain time, but the minute that embargo's up, we're going to post a ton of shit from the show, so we're really excited.

666
00:47:19,343 --> 00:47:20,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, DMM, what's on your mind tonight?

667
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:22,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Three things.

668
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:27,248
[SPEAKER_04]: One, huge STFU announcement.

669
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:28,829
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your Thursday night program, yes?

670
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:29,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

671
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:35,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Not this week, but next week, we're going to have MC Frontalot on the show for five good minutes.

672
00:47:35,693 --> 00:47:36,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you!

673
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:37,534
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't.

674
00:47:38,962 --> 00:47:40,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew Jamie would be pissed.

675
00:47:40,203 --> 00:47:42,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell him to say something for me and record it, please.

676
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:46,627
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we Skype you in and you can talk to him?

677
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:49,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I have school.

678
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: When are you guys taping it?

679
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:52,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you don't do it live.

680
00:47:52,251 --> 00:47:52,992
[SPEAKER_06]: When are you guys taping it?

681
00:47:53,752 --> 00:47:54,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

682
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:57,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep you posted, but I'll kick Jimmy to the curb and you can interview with me.

683
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:58,556
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

684
00:47:58,716 --> 00:48:00,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I have school every night this week, dude.

685
00:48:01,097 --> 00:48:02,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not this week.

686
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:03,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It's next week.

687
00:48:05,557 --> 00:48:08,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't your people talk to his people and see what you can come up with?

688
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,241
[SPEAKER_03]: My people will talk to your people.

689
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,482
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, maybe we can get them on this show.

690
00:48:10,742 --> 00:48:13,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway, so that's exciting news for you guys.

691
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:14,966
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are getting more celebrities than we are.

692
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:16,927
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?

693
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all Jimmy's fault.

694
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:19,570
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been around for five years.

695
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:24,494
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are on like nine weeks, and you're having freaking... Fuck you.

696
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:26,095
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

697
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:27,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you too, Rob.

698
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:29,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just call to rub it in, or is there anything else you want to say?

699
00:48:29,478 --> 00:48:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I actually had two things.

700
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:35,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a review of Bookworm Adventures.

701
00:48:36,106 --> 00:48:38,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, Bookworm Adventures is awesome.

702
00:48:39,388 --> 00:48:42,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much the greatest casual game ever made.

703
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:45,031
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Xbox Live needs.

704
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:48,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $30 for the full version.

705
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:49,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds kind of steep.

706
00:48:51,155 --> 00:48:51,996
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a keyboard.

707
00:48:52,316 --> 00:48:53,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but not everyone does.

708
00:48:53,577 --> 00:48:57,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fuck them.

709
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $30 for the full version.

710
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:01,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit steep, but very much worth it.

711
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:07,117
[SPEAKER_06]: exciting is there any particular reason you love Bookworm Adventures?

712
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:10,598
[SPEAKER_06]: is it the smarts you get to use in constructing words?

713
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:11,338
[SPEAKER_06]: is it the graphics?

714
00:49:11,378 --> 00:49:12,159
[SPEAKER_06]: what is it about the game?

715
00:49:13,279 --> 00:49:29,225
[SPEAKER_04]: it's that and it's the charm and the game makes this really crazy deep voice like a voiceover guy if you beat the crap out of an enemy it's like CRUSH it's pretty cool can you do that one more time please?

716
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:31,706
[SPEAKER_06]: CRUSH that's pretty awesome

717
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:33,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything else on your mind tonight, DMN?

718
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, bonus segment.

719
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:37,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to talk about that.

720
00:49:37,771 --> 00:49:47,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the podcast listeners didn't hear it, but I actually can totally sympathize with that one lady because I just broke up with my girlfriend over WoW.

721
00:49:48,656 --> 00:49:48,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

722
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:54,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember calling her or you or the both of you during Guys on a Show one night.

723
00:49:54,498 --> 00:49:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't Guys on a Show.

724
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It was this show when I was really fucking plastered.

725
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right, when you called in here drunk.

726
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:01,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys broke up?

727
00:50:02,618 --> 00:50:03,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Over WoW, what happened?

728
00:50:04,058 --> 00:50:04,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Over WoW?

729
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:16,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one, I came over to visit her several weeks ago, and she decided that playing WoW and raiding was more important than spending time with me, and that kind of pissed me off.

730
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:22,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I called her earlier this week to see if she wanted to do something, and she's like, no, I'm playing Burning Crusade.

731
00:50:22,963 --> 00:50:23,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get 70.

732
00:50:23,903 --> 00:50:25,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, you know what?

733
00:50:25,444 --> 00:50:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

734
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:27,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done with this shit.

735
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:28,744
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want?

736
00:50:28,844 --> 00:50:31,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want level 70 or cocked?

737
00:50:32,023 --> 00:50:33,084
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to make a decision.

738
00:50:34,025 --> 00:50:34,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you told her?

739
00:50:35,185 --> 00:50:41,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, you know, you find WoW more important than, you know, hanging out with me and I care about you and I do all this shit for you.

740
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:44,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, that's how I would break it down.

741
00:50:44,552 --> 00:50:51,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say, you know, if I was having this problem in a relationship, I would say, look, do you want level 70 or do you want the cock?

742
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:52,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can't have both.

743
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:57,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I game and I get laid when I want it.

744
00:50:58,363 --> 00:50:58,663
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

745
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:01,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's because you married a nerd.

746
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:02,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

747
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

748
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:04,854
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, anything else you want to share?

749
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:05,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to let some other people on.

750
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:07,356
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to tell Rob he parks like an asshole.

751
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:11,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob, your parking sucks.

752
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

753
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does my parking suck?

754
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:15,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, when I was down... Oops, we lost the connection.

755
00:51:17,924 --> 00:51:23,228
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like to call us, our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

756
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:25,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can give us a call.

757
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:25,790
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

758
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,412
[SPEAKER_06]: That's toll free in the United States.

759
00:51:32,432 --> 00:51:33,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob can't hang up on me.

760
00:51:35,534 --> 00:51:36,835
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I can unplug your mic.

761
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I can steal yours and beat you in the head with it.

762
00:51:40,218 --> 00:51:40,938
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that, Jamie?

763
00:51:44,822 --> 00:51:45,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Ow, ow.

764
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:46,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn, it hurt.

765
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:49,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike is like hardwired in that fucking mix board.

766
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:53,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because my powerful, awesome voice has fused it there.

767
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:56,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally owned Rob.

768
00:51:57,412 --> 00:51:57,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

769
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:01,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if I broke your arm.

770
00:52:02,128 --> 00:52:04,029
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll just have to give me a free massage.

771
00:52:09,131 --> 00:52:12,213
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll just have to give me a free massage from MassageTheRapist.com.

772
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:19,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I take my profession seriously.

773
00:52:19,316 --> 00:52:20,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

774
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:21,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

775
00:52:21,998 --> 00:52:22,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku.

776
00:52:22,918 --> 00:52:23,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Legend of Zaku.

777
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:24,459
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

778
00:52:25,336 --> 00:52:30,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, you, uh, all that 2DX stuff that I've been hearing from, from Over the Pond.

779
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:32,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the Pond, yeah.

780
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that whole Ghostbusters thing that kind of shocked us last week.

781
00:52:37,402 --> 00:52:37,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

782
00:52:38,462 --> 00:52:38,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember?

783
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:41,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, okay, what about it?

784
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,881
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

785
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:20,461
[SPEAKER_01]: You also know that Bettson mentioned in a press release that they're supposed to be having, you know, one of their top guys said that they're supposed to be having a content update for Supernova.

786
00:53:20,481 --> 00:53:23,163
[SPEAKER_01]: They're supposed to add 200 to 300 more songs into it.

787
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:26,826
[SPEAKER_06]: 200 to 300 more songs in DDR Supernova in the arcade?

788
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:28,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Show Bettson press release.

789
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:29,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

790
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who knows?

791
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:32,702
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be something they're announcing.

792
00:53:32,762 --> 00:53:35,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Konami's gearing up for lots of announcements this week.

793
00:53:35,544 --> 00:53:39,047
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been kind of quiet, so I think we're going to get just blasted with stuff.

794
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:43,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if that is true, you'll hear about it Thursday.

795
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:51,016
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't hear about it then, or Friday, I don't know when the news is embargoed, but Thursday or Friday, if you don't hear after that, it probably wasn't true.

796
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,699
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could do it right now.

797
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:55,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch.

798
00:53:55,659 --> 00:53:56,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post it up on chat.

799
00:53:57,681 --> 00:53:58,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

800
00:53:58,642 --> 00:53:58,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.

801
00:53:59,827 --> 00:54:05,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, but how often are things talked about that don't necessarily happen, such as Link Mode?

802
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:10,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was never Konami or Benson's fault.

803
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:13,491
[SPEAKER_01]: That was because they got shafted by the people that were supposed to make the part for them.

804
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:22,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I was disappointed at first, but I let that slide because I have faith that Konami might find another way.

805
00:54:23,515 --> 00:54:24,775
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they don't, so be it.

806
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:28,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they'll eventually find an alternative.

807
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:30,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be now, right?

808
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:34,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably in the next... Alright, you been playing anything else besides Bomani lately?

809
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:39,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, more in the Groove R21, and I just played Drum Mania today.

810
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:40,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me rephrase.

811
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you been playing anything that is not a music game?

812
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:46,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Initial... I started playing Initial D today.

813
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:46,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there you go.

814
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:47,384
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something.

815
00:54:47,504 --> 00:54:48,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the arcade?

816
00:54:49,005 --> 00:54:49,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

817
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:51,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the card and everything.

818
00:54:51,907 --> 00:54:52,308
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that?

819
00:54:52,428 --> 00:54:54,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a lot of competition in your neck of the woods?

820
00:54:55,146 --> 00:54:57,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually traveled out of state today.

821
00:54:57,206 --> 00:55:04,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a tournament, so I managed to play, you know, in addition to other stuff, I just played, you know, I managed to get into Initial D while I was at it.

822
00:55:04,988 --> 00:55:05,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

823
00:55:06,628 --> 00:55:13,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't that much, but it's really hard to find an Initial D machine in Chinatown anyways.

824
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one place, but I will make efforts to follow up on that.

825
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:17,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

826
00:55:18,211 --> 00:55:24,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, Zaku, your voice is breaking up a little bit, but thanks so much for calling in, as you always do, and we'll talk to you another time, alrighty?

827
00:55:25,818 --> 00:55:53,751
[SPEAKER_06]: have a good one if you want to give us a call it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or it's username Orange Lounge Radio on Skype if you're sick of the same old people calling in week after week then you're not helping because you're not calling us so you should get on your telephone and give us a call right now it's 1-877-GAME-OLR otherwise it's going to be the same people get through every week or you can always leave us a voicemail because I know some folks can't listen live on Sunday and so they want to you know interact with us in other ways so

828
00:55:55,005 --> 00:55:56,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll do one more call.

829
00:55:56,546 --> 00:55:59,208
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go over to this one.

830
00:55:59,468 --> 00:56:00,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

831
00:56:00,629 --> 00:56:00,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

832
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:02,790
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ranma.

833
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:03,790
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you guys doing?

834
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:04,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Ranma.

835
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,812
[SPEAKER_06]: You've already been on the show today.

836
00:56:07,112 --> 00:56:07,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Your voicemail.

837
00:56:09,354 --> 00:56:11,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I do what I can to help the show out.

838
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,175
[SPEAKER_08]: You know me.

839
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:13,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you guys and girls.

840
00:56:13,476 --> 00:56:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

841
00:56:13,976 --> 00:56:14,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool.

842
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:14,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot.

843
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:21,040
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fun to... You know, we had Freeze Pop, at least we had a casting from Freeze Pop about a year ago on the show, and it was very nice.

844
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish them a lot of success.

845
00:56:23,101 --> 00:56:23,942
[SPEAKER_06]: They're a good bunch.

846
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:26,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweetness.

847
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:29,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I also hope you liked the voicemail I left you on your personal line.

848
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:31,393
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

849
00:56:31,613 --> 00:56:33,354
[SPEAKER_06]: It cut out.

850
00:56:33,714 --> 00:56:34,634
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it supposed to be?

851
00:56:34,654 --> 00:56:36,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I heard a couple notes.

852
00:56:36,474 --> 00:56:37,614
[SPEAKER_06]: They were playing a song.

853
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,855
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded like they were starting to play a song, but you were obviously indoors because it cut out.

854
00:56:41,915 --> 00:56:42,776
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you trying to leave?

855
00:56:44,516 --> 00:56:45,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk more rock.

856
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:47,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, okay.

857
00:56:47,557 --> 00:56:49,097
[SPEAKER_06]: See, all I could hear, this is the voicemail.

858
00:56:49,117 --> 00:56:50,897
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, this is for you, Rob.

859
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:52,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's all I could hear.

860
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,738
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it went, you know, cell phone drop.

861
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:57,210
[SPEAKER_06]: You might need to switch carriers.

862
00:56:58,611 --> 00:57:02,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when we played that, there were a few people that showed up with their Guitar Hero controllers.

863
00:57:02,313 --> 00:57:05,275
[SPEAKER_08]: They moved towards the front and started, like, freestyling on the song.

864
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:08,457
[SPEAKER_06]: People showed up with their Guitar Hero controller to the Freeze Pop concert?

865
00:57:09,417 --> 00:57:13,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, one of my friends, Aaron, he got them to sign his controller.

866
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,380
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty hardcore.

867
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:14,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that, though.

868
00:57:14,941 --> 00:57:15,341
[SPEAKER_06]: That's rad.

869
00:57:15,861 --> 00:57:16,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.

870
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:18,123
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

871
00:57:18,663 --> 00:57:20,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anything else you want to share with us, Ranma?

872
00:57:20,624 --> 00:57:22,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a good time at the concert overall?

873
00:57:23,308 --> 00:57:25,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I did, and I also picked up another video game.

874
00:57:25,669 --> 00:57:27,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I got Elite Beat Agents.

875
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, Elite Beat Agents, one of my favorites from 06.

876
00:57:29,251 --> 00:57:30,091
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think?

877
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:32,393
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

878
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:36,575
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as easy as O and Don, but I'm enjoying it.

879
00:57:37,755 --> 00:57:40,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait until the difficulty really ramps up as you go through it.

880
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:42,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I believe it.

881
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to finish the last song on easy.

882
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:45,840
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

883
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,162
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, Ranma, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for the voicemails.

884
00:57:50,182 --> 00:57:50,702
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

885
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,250
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

886
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:56,752
[SPEAKER_08]: My friend Patty agrees with you, what you said about the whole Wii incident.

887
00:57:57,032 --> 00:57:57,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Just letting you know.

888
00:57:58,133 --> 00:57:59,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thanks for the support.

889
00:58:00,254 --> 00:58:00,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Later.

890
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:01,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, bye.

891
00:58:01,655 --> 00:58:03,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thanks so much to all of our callers tonight.

892
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:04,097
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

893
00:58:04,137 --> 00:58:05,478
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't get through, that's okay.

894
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:06,759
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always leave us a voicemail.

895
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:10,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.

896
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going to open it up to any last minute stories we have here in studio.

897
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:14,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Any last minute stories from anyone?

898
00:58:15,044 --> 00:58:15,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

899
00:58:16,265 --> 00:58:16,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

900
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:16,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

901
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, some interesting stuff for the PSP, including a brand new game coming to it.

902
00:58:22,923 --> 00:58:25,425
[SPEAKER_07]: This should get Jamie happy, or very happy here.

903
00:58:25,805 --> 00:58:26,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Happity.

904
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Happity, yes, very happity.

905
00:58:30,689 --> 00:58:32,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Dracula X, Rondo of Blood.

906
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:33,110
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

907
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:39,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Is coming to the PSP, according to UK-based game magazine Play.

908
00:58:40,796 --> 00:58:42,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's kind of cool.

909
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:44,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty.

910
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:46,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Other stuff, though...

911
00:58:47,403 --> 00:58:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

912
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:53,905
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're expecting Final Fantasy XIII this year, sorry to disappoint you, but that's not happening.

913
00:58:53,925 --> 00:58:54,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream on.

914
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:55,465
[SPEAKER_06]: We all knew that.

915
00:58:55,686 --> 00:59:02,528
[SPEAKER_07]: According to Tetsuya Nomura himself, he said it's not going to happen.

916
00:59:02,908 --> 00:59:07,649
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, hopefully going to be out in 2008.

917
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:11,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that's even that.

918
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:16,052
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll probably get it late 2008 in Japan, and then we won't get it here until like 2019.

919
00:59:17,406 --> 00:59:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Which sucks.

920
00:59:18,766 --> 00:59:21,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that'll be when I get a PlayStation 3, it'll be 2009.

921
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:21,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

922
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:38,091
[SPEAKER_07]: According to Midway, because I know they've had their Midway's Gamer Day, was actually last week, they had some info regarding the Midway Classics that are going to be on the PlayStation Network.

923
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:42,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, some of the pricing for that, Demon Slayer,

924
00:59:43,408 --> 00:59:49,211
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to be $4.99 and should hit the PlayStation Store in the next few months.

925
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:56,555
[SPEAKER_07]: But it doesn't really say what are the other costs on like say for example the Mortal Kombat games or anything like that.

926
00:59:58,456 --> 00:59:59,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But they look good though.

927
00:59:59,297 --> 01:00:05,660
[SPEAKER_07]: They have some screenshots actually online now of like Mortal Kombat and Rampart and Super Sprint and stuff like that.

928
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool.

929
01:00:09,142 --> 01:00:09,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And then

930
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:38,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what the hell this is but apparently there's this homebrew program called Mini VMAC for the DS where apparently they're running Mac OS on a DS which is so wrong but okay and then of course a PlayStation 3 ISO loader is being worked on right now and hopefully it'll be done soon they're in testing phase so Piracy on the PlayStation 3 coming soon

931
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:42,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Sony's thrilled to hear that news.

932
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:43,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

933
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:45,584
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, you have anything for us last minute?

934
01:00:45,984 --> 01:00:47,645
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just have my usual awesome.

935
01:00:49,265 --> 01:00:52,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well then I guess that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

936
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:57,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, thanks so much for tuning in to us, downloading it, and supporting independent internet radio.

937
01:00:57,188 --> 01:01:00,669
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it, and it is that support that keeps us going week after week.

938
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,450
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you back here next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.

939
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:09,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I do believe there's some football game on TV, but we're not watching, so we'll be here Sunday night live, 6 o'clock Pacific to...

940
01:01:10,612 --> 01:01:11,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about more games.

941
01:01:12,072 --> 01:01:18,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So until then, this is Rob Roberts for DarkSakura and Loki saying see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

942
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:24,437
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

943
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:27,358
