Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.500
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday, January 21st, 2007

00:25.500 --> 00:29.500
for our Part B of our little program we do here.

00:29.500 --> 00:35.000
And, of course, our podcast or audio blog is released on Mondays and Wednesdays

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Mikul Tov was guesting with us during Part A, but he's actually having to take off

00:52.000 --> 00:53.500
so he won't be around for Part B.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.000
So, bye-bye Mikul Tov!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.500
And now we're going to get back into some news.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.500
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?

00:59.500 --> 01:01.000
I don't wanna. Okay, well...

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
You have to.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Do I have to?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
You have to.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.500
Okay. Well, there is a game to be coming out called Flow

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
that had a December 6 release date.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.000
And I say had.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.500
It's now been pushed back to January 2007.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.500
That means, you know, maybe a couple weeks from now, right?

01:20.500 --> 01:21.500
Right.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.500
But it just seems like there's, you know, more and more delays.

01:24.500 --> 01:28.500
The speculation is that they're still fixing little stuff in it.

01:28.500 --> 01:32.500
But when they were pressured for an official statement,

01:32.500 --> 01:35.500
SCEA was basically stating,

01:35.500 --> 01:38.500
We'll be posting a trailer at the end of this month, beginning of next.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.500
As for the game itself, we will be releasing it near the end of February!

01:41.500 --> 01:43.500
Wow.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.500
February.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.500
Yeah.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.500
This is a very anticipated online title, though.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.500
You know, I played the little online one. It's cute.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.500
It should be interesting on a PS3.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.500
It kind of reminds me of, I don't know, Electroplankton for some weird reason.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.500
I love Electroplankton.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.500
It just does. It kind of reminds me of that for some weird reason.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.500
Right.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.500
Speaking of music games, actually, I want to interject this

02:02.500 --> 02:04.500
because I left this out of How Was My Gaming Week?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.500
and I don't think it's in our show world tonight.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.500
I had a chance, and I can't say how,

02:08.500 --> 02:13.500
but I had a chance to play the dance MMO that's in closed beta right now.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.500
And so I want to give you my thoughts on it.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.500
It's kind of interesting.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.500
There's a couple of licensed songs in it,

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
and then the rest of it is all normal stuff.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
And, of course, it's set up very similar to DDR.

02:25.500 --> 02:30.500
It's like a mix between DDR and one of those online Korean or Japanese games

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
that people play like R2 Beat, O2 Jam, those things.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.500
The interface really reminds me of that.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.500
I believe it was developed by one of those companies

02:37.500 --> 02:39.500
because it shows the logo there in the beginning.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.500
I noticed a couple of licensed songs.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.500
There was a Madonna song in there, but an old one.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
I think it was like Papa Don't Preach was in there.

02:45.500 --> 02:46.500
And then, of course, I remember

02:46.500 --> 02:50.500
Jump Around, Jump Around, Jump Up, Jump Up was in there, that song.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.500
But some of the steps are pretty atrocious.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.500
That's what I noticed.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.500
It starts getting to be very in the groove level difficulty

02:58.500 --> 03:00.500
when you get up pretty high, which on your fingers is...

03:00.500 --> 03:01.500
I'm serious.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.500
Some of these steps are just too crazy.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.500
It's like finger-finger mania or something.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.500
But otherwise...

03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
Wow, that sounds fascinating to hear finger mania.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
Otherwise, the game was...

03:13.500 --> 03:17.500
It was very comparable to one of those other types of MMOs you would play.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.500
And their music, although long, they don't edit the music down.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.500
It was all like two, three and a half minute songs.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.500
It fit pretty good.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.500
I had a fairly okay time with it.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.500
It screams polish to me.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.500
I hope they don't...

03:31.500 --> 03:33.500
No, I think they're going to add more stuff to it.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.500
And I hear it's changing a lot.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.500
You'll notice things get added and disappear,

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
so I think they're still putting some tweaks on it.

03:40.500 --> 03:44.500
I'm going to try some more songs that have yet to go into it.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.500
And I imagine...

03:46.500 --> 03:49.500
They're probably still trying to figure out what the model is going to be.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
I'm pretty sure the game is going to be free,

03:51.500 --> 03:52.500
which I hope it is,

03:52.500 --> 03:57.500
because I couldn't see myself paying much more than ten bucks for it.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.500
I understand there might be licenses in the game and stuff,

04:00.500 --> 04:03.500
but the game itself just not...

04:03.500 --> 04:05.500
How many people play DDR on the PC?

04:05.500 --> 04:08.500
Not enough, in my opinion.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.500
It's really tough when there's a big DDR simulator out there

04:12.500 --> 04:18.500
that's free and has thousands upon thousands of tracks

04:18.500 --> 04:21.500
freely available out there.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.500
Anyway, I just wanted to say that.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.500
I got a chance to look at the beta,

04:26.500 --> 04:28.500
and that's what's going on with it.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.500
Anyway, back to the news.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.500
Dark Soccer had brought up Flow for the PlayStation 3.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.500
Another game that was being anticipated for the PlayStation 3 was Warhawk.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.500
There was a rumor, and I emphasize a rumor going on right now,

04:40.500 --> 04:46.500
that Warhawk could actually turn into a PS3 downloadable title instead,

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
just like a Gran Turismo HD.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.500
I believe they did confirm saying that it was not cancelled.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.500
It was not cancelled. That's good.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.500
It would be interesting if you have all these games

04:56.500 --> 04:58.500
that are kind of going down that path.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
But apparently the whole rumor started

05:00.500 --> 05:02.500
because there was a new director who was brought in

05:02.500 --> 05:05.500
who was thinking about changing the whole direction for Warhawk.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.500
Interesting.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
Yes.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.500
What's also interesting is that Wii and PlayStation 3 discs

05:10.500 --> 05:12.500
have been dumped to ISOs,

05:12.500 --> 05:18.500
making way for a whole new brand of piracy for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.500
PlayStation 3 I could see because it's Blu-ray,

05:21.500 --> 05:24.500
and the system has a hard drive built into it,

05:24.500 --> 05:29.500
so I'm seeing something pretty similar to what happened with the PlayStation 2

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
happening with the PlayStation 3.

05:31.500 --> 05:37.500
But right now, Cracking Group Paradox has dumped the first ISO,

05:37.500 --> 05:40.500
not yet playable, but they've still dumped it,

05:40.500 --> 05:46.500
and it's only a matter of time, of Motorstorm, the Japanese ISO for that.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.500
And right now they're saying that the first few sectors

05:50.500 --> 05:53.500
of the PlayStation 3 image are special

05:53.500 --> 05:56.500
and may contain the decryption keys for the executables,

05:56.500 --> 06:01.500
but right now they still haven't figured out exactly how to run stuff yet.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.500
On the other front, though, with the Wii,

06:04.500 --> 06:08.500
there's actually been a program released to be able to dump that,

06:08.500 --> 06:13.500
and I believe it's two freely available programs to be able to dump those.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.500
One, of course, is called DVD Info Pro.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
That's available out there right now.

06:19.500 --> 06:24.500
And then there's another program that you use once you have that,

06:24.500 --> 06:30.500
the RAW to Dump, and they'll dump an image of the Wii DVD.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.500
But of course, once again, they haven't figured out how to run those yet either.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.500
But that's half the battles, dumping the disc,

06:36.500 --> 06:38.500
and the other half is getting it on there and playing it,

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
so it's only a matter of time.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.500
So how long before we see fully pirated Wii and PS3 games available on the Internet?

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Probably a few months.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.500
The Wii's kind of tricky because it's really hard to read those discs.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.500
A normal computer can't read them,

06:50.500 --> 06:55.500
so I'm not sure about the Blu-Ray ROMs for the PS3,

06:55.500 --> 06:58.500
but I know that the Wii ones are pretty hard.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.500
So I don't know. We'll see.

07:00.500 --> 07:06.500
Hopefully, Sony's protection in the past has been pretty crappy,

07:06.500 --> 07:10.500
so I wouldn't be surprised if we see this stuff pretty soon.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.500
All right.

07:13.500 --> 07:23.500
Well, as far as getting back into what is actually available and legally,

07:23.500 --> 07:30.500
for our listeners in the UK, actually, there's some new games heading to a virtual console.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.500
We have Street Fighter II going on there

07:34.500 --> 07:41.500
and also a game called Super Probotector, which in the U.S. is Contra III,

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
which is so unfair because I want Contra III.

07:44.500 --> 07:48.500
It's an 800 Wii Point game.

07:48.500 --> 07:53.500
Goodwin, if you want to check it out, let me know how good it pulls over.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.500
I've been pleased with everything that's come up for virtual consoles.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.500
They still have Flickr. I think it's fantastic.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.500
But those are new ones coming out.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.500
Lucky.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.500
Yeah, I want to know what we're getting.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.500
We still don't know what we're getting tomorrow, do we?

08:07.500 --> 08:09.500
There's rumors, but we don't know for sure, right?

08:09.500 --> 08:10.500
I want Super Contra III.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.500
We don't know, but there's other stuff that's in the works, I know that.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
All kind of rumors, though, right?

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
I'm sure I've seen Kid Icarus, but...

08:18.500 --> 08:24.500
Well, no, this is stuff that's, of course, coming from the ESRB website.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.500
And I want to say, let me see here.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.500
There was quite a bit that was coming out.

08:30.500 --> 08:34.500
One of them was Bonk III for a virtual console.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.500
That's coming out soon, at least.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.500
And I know they were showing...

08:40.500 --> 08:41.500
Well, Kid Icarus was on there a while ago.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.500
Mighty Bomb Jack.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.500
Xevious.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
Let's see here, Jewel Quest 2.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.500
I think that's...

08:50.500 --> 08:52.500
Xevious was in last week's releases.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.500
Yeah, that's probably a full game, the Jewel Quest 2 thing.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.500
Let's see here.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.500
That's all the ones I see.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.500
What about the Nintendo originals?

09:01.500 --> 09:04.500
Weren't there supposed to be, like, original virtual console things coming out?

09:04.500 --> 09:08.500
Yeah, wasn't there supposed to be online play as well?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
Right, it'll come eventually.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
Like, eons away from now.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
I guess all in good time.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.500
We'll see.

09:16.500 --> 09:28.500
Well, now, another very interesting story going around about the Wii is that, you know, of course, there's always these, I don't know what you'd call them, parental groups that want to prevent anybody from having fun.

09:28.500 --> 09:40.500
Well, apparently, the WFAA has put out this thing going out that says that, hey, look, the Wii and the PlayStation 3 can get on the internet.

09:40.500 --> 09:48.500
Therefore, your kids are accessing pornography through the Wii and the PlayStation 3.

09:48.500 --> 09:58.500
Because, you know, how easy is it that you can go on and you can go click-click on, you know, Pornotube or something and go access some pornography?

09:58.500 --> 10:04.500
I'm actually looking at the website here that says, oh, my gosh, these games are internet access.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
They're gateways to pornography.

10:06.500 --> 10:12.500
They can play WarioWare, Guitar Hero, and PlayStation 3 as well, and pornography.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.500
I love the pornography game.

10:13.500 --> 10:18.500
There's a quote here in this article, quote, they're innocent and we want to try and keep them that way.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.500
It's very upsetting something this popular, a kid game, can go that direction so quickly.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.500
Oh, shut up, stupid fucking...

10:25.500 --> 10:32.500
And even in this story, in a blog one child boasted, the first thing I thought of when I downloaded the Wii browser was also porn.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.500
Yeah, I'm sure it was really a child that was blogging about that shit.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.500
Well, if they were under 18, you'd see a 17-year-old would be considered a child.

10:39.500 --> 10:44.500
But it's the same damn thing as the computer, right?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
Yeah.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.500
If you have a PC in your house, that is also a gateway to porn.

10:49.500 --> 10:55.500
So monitor your kids' Wii and PS3 use just like you do their PC use.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.500
Duh.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.500
How hard is that?

10:57.500 --> 11:00.500
That kind of pisses me off that people are trying to spin this.

11:00.500 --> 11:04.500
It's like, oh, my gosh, the Wii has chicks doing it on it.

11:04.500 --> 11:07.500
Well, that's just like saying, you know, eating McDonald's is going to make you fat.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.500
Then the next week later, oh, eating Burger King is going to make you fat.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.500
And then the next week later, oh, Taco Bell is going to make you fat.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
They're all gateways to fatness.

11:15.500 --> 11:22.500
You know, well, it's just fucking stupid bitches that need the fucking attention.

11:22.500 --> 11:28.500
And every news outlet seems to do this kind of shit too.

11:28.500 --> 11:33.500
Oh, my God, it's because they don't have news and they need something to fill space.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.500
That's what it fucking is.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.500
And if there's another, you know, device that comes out there that's a gateway, you know,

11:38.500 --> 11:41.500
that has the Internet on it, oh, my God, it's a gateway to porn.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
You know what?

11:42.500 --> 11:46.500
There's fucking goddamn child safety stuff on there.

11:46.500 --> 11:51.500
They even have the update to block the Internet before, you know, the Internet browser was

11:51.500 --> 11:56.500
even available and the weather too because, my God, there can be some pornography in the

11:56.500 --> 11:57.500
weather.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.500
Oh, I remember that one time there was the topless weather girl on the weather channel.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
Well, this is something completely different.

12:03.500 --> 12:10.500
I mean, they have the tools are there for the parents to use and it's just the parents

12:10.500 --> 12:11.500
are being stupid.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.500
And that's all it is.

12:12.500 --> 12:18.500
And because for one, I mean, pulling up porn on the Wii is fucking slow.

12:18.500 --> 12:23.500
I mean, granted, you can do it, but they have the parental controls on there.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.500
Lots of good comments from chat chat.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.500
Don't orange launch radio dot com live on this Sunday evening on this topic, DDR dollar

12:28.500 --> 12:31.500
Bill says, fuck, the cell phone is a gateway to the Internet.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.500
Thus, it can get on porno sites.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.780
James Patrick says, well, there's porn sites built for the Wii like people, you know, kind

12:37.780 --> 12:40.140
of catering to that whole thing.

12:40.140 --> 12:46.080
And I'm looking at as well, let's see, Black Boy says, there are also programs that restrict

12:46.080 --> 12:50.220
what websites can be accessed on the computer, but we don't really see anything like that

12:50.220 --> 12:51.220
on the Wii yet.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.220
Yeah.

12:52.220 --> 12:53.220
It's called the parental controls.

12:53.220 --> 12:55.020
Does that work on websites too?

12:55.020 --> 12:58.020
It's for the whole Internet, blocks the whole Internet from.

12:58.020 --> 12:59.280
Oh, okay.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.280
Very interesting.

13:00.280 --> 13:05.460
Also, somebody else said here that you could get it on the PSP as well, and they left it

13:05.460 --> 13:06.460
out.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.580
Well, Shadow Charlie says, PSP can give you porn, and they don't say shit about that.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.500
And then Trax leaves us with this thought, if you can't rationally parent your child,

13:13.500 --> 13:15.540
shouldn't have one in the first place.

13:15.540 --> 13:20.000
Oh, and then, of course, S2H makes this groaner.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.900
These parents are probably the same types who would let people drink two gallons of

13:22.900 --> 13:27.300
water in a short time.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.560
Now they win because water is a gateway to porn.

13:29.560 --> 13:35.500
That takes us to our FUs of the Week, because you know what, when we hear about these stupid,

13:35.500 --> 13:39.620
uninformed stories, we get very angry, and we want to rant a little bit, because we can.

13:39.620 --> 13:40.620
It's our show.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.620
We can do what we want.

13:41.620 --> 13:49.980
Dark Soccer, are you ready to get angsty?

13:49.980 --> 13:53.440
I've been ready.

13:53.440 --> 14:02.700
My FU of the Week goes towards distance, and knowing that two people that I care an awful

14:02.700 --> 14:09.020
lot about are separated by it right now.

14:09.020 --> 14:14.340
I really don't know what else to say, just that I hope they hang in there and can't wait

14:14.340 --> 14:19.020
to see them together again, and I'm talking about Chris and Megzy.

14:19.020 --> 14:25.140
The official OLR lesbians will be reunited again soon.

14:25.140 --> 14:29.300
Fucking to your neighbors, because they're dumb little kids that won't fucking get out

14:29.300 --> 14:30.300
of the way of cars.

14:30.300 --> 14:34.740
I mean, I'm sitting there trying to park my car, and they're playing football in the middle

14:34.740 --> 14:40.340
street in the dark, by the way, and they won't fucking move, so fuck them, and I'm glad I

14:40.340 --> 14:44.900
ran over your fucking toy last week, stupid bitches, and I will run you over if you get

14:44.900 --> 14:47.780
my car away again.

14:47.780 --> 15:02.220
My FU of the Week goes to my office chair, which is now sitting in the corner of the

15:02.220 --> 15:07.700
room, broken, because it snapped in two places when my fat ass plopped in it the other day.

15:07.700 --> 15:20.380
It's quite funny, because it is now the hoopy chair, because you can sit in and lean back.

15:20.380 --> 15:24.940
A big thank you to Duck Tape, which I think will fix my chair soon, although Dark Sakura

15:24.940 --> 15:27.820
did say I could probably get a new one pretty cheap at IKEA, and it would look better than

15:27.820 --> 15:31.820
Duck Tape, and I do love me some IKEA, I need an excuse to go there.

15:31.820 --> 15:37.100
I recommend, though, Duck Tape might fix Dark Sakura's chair.

15:37.100 --> 15:41.300
I've tried to fix this chair with Duck Tape.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.300
We should just cover the whole chair in Duck Tape.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.820
No, because I don't want to be sneaky.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.820
Maybe I'll get another chair soon, but that means money.

15:47.820 --> 15:50.060
I'd adjust and it'd sound like a fart.

15:50.060 --> 15:51.620
Oh, and FU to dental bills.

15:51.620 --> 15:56.140
Oh, God, I hate when I go to the dentist, I feel like I'm going to a used car salesman.

15:56.140 --> 16:00.260
They're trying to talk me into all this crap I don't need, and it's like, you know, if

16:00.260 --> 16:06.080
I don't do it, then my teeth are all going to fall out, and I know that's not true.

16:06.080 --> 16:11.140
My dentist is trying to get me to upgrade to a $1,000 crown.

16:11.140 --> 16:15.940
A crown that costs $1,000 because they say my insurance will only cover a tin can.

16:15.940 --> 16:20.140
I have a $1,000 crown.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.940
Did you pay for all of that out of pocket?

16:21.940 --> 16:23.940
I paid $500 out of it.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.940
See, my insurance won't pay for any of it.

16:25.940 --> 16:26.940
It sucks.

16:26.940 --> 16:30.220
The whole reason I have the one I did is because it was absolute necessity because it was my

16:30.220 --> 16:32.100
back molar that broke.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.180
The root broke, and I had to have the whole thing pulled out.

16:35.180 --> 16:36.180
No, no, no.

16:36.180 --> 16:37.180
That's not my situation.

16:37.180 --> 16:46.140
See, don't feel bad about having, you know, the tin one when it could be a lot worse.

16:46.140 --> 16:47.140
Exactly.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.460
Anyway, moving on.

16:50.460 --> 16:54.860
This is exactly why I don't go to the dentist.

16:54.860 --> 16:56.620
When you go, you're going to be in for a surprise.

16:56.620 --> 17:00.540
They're going to tell you that your teeth are fucked and you need $5,000 to fix them.

17:00.540 --> 17:03.020
I'll tell them to fuck off and I'll leave.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.100
This is why I never came back.

17:04.100 --> 17:08.740
When your teeth hurt, I mean, teeth pain is the worst type of pain you can have anywhere.

17:08.740 --> 17:14.700
I have one tooth that's been hurting, and I went to the dentist and suddenly they told

17:14.700 --> 17:19.220
me $2,000 worth of work I needed, and I'm like, that's different if your teeth are hurting,

17:19.220 --> 17:20.220
but mine aren't.

17:20.220 --> 17:23.460
I only have one tooth that hurts, and they tell me I need work on all 20.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.620
I have my wisdom teeth in because I'm wise.

17:26.620 --> 17:27.620
That's why.

17:27.620 --> 17:28.620
I hate the dentist.

17:28.620 --> 17:29.620
I hate the dentist.

17:29.620 --> 17:30.620
I wonder why people are afraid of the dentist.

17:30.620 --> 17:34.660
I'm involved to have extra chewing power because I eat a lot of meat.

17:34.660 --> 17:41.020
I need to eat twice the amount of animals to make up for the vegetarians.

17:41.020 --> 17:48.300
The porn industry, they seem to be ahead of technology as far as video and stuff goes.

17:48.300 --> 17:54.260
They were the first to have pre-recorded video cassettes, the first to jump on the DVD bandwagon,

17:54.260 --> 17:57.700
and now the first to be using HD DVD.

17:57.700 --> 18:01.500
That's kind of the format they're going with because of a couple reasons.

18:01.500 --> 18:06.140
First off, HD DVD is a lot easier to produce and cheaper, and also there was that whole

18:06.140 --> 18:11.220
fiasco of people saying that they're actually not going to let them duplicate Blu-Ray discs,

18:11.220 --> 18:12.620
although I don't think that's really the case.

18:12.620 --> 18:13.620
It's just more expensive.

18:13.620 --> 18:22.460
Of the two formats, it seems to be out of an impartial survey during the adult entertainment

18:22.460 --> 18:27.580
expo that was going on there that HD DVD sounds like the way it's going to go, at least for

18:27.580 --> 18:28.580
the porn industry.

18:28.580 --> 18:32.260
So, if you have a 360, there you go, some porn.

18:32.260 --> 18:36.620
Although I do recommend, though, if you are going to watch porn on the PS3, just dump

18:36.620 --> 18:39.540
it to your hard drive.

18:39.540 --> 18:40.780
You know what, though?

18:40.780 --> 18:43.620
I got to be honest.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.460
If they do go to HD DVD, which it sounds like they're going to do, this is it.

18:46.460 --> 18:47.620
It's over.

18:47.620 --> 18:48.940
Format wars are over.

18:48.940 --> 18:53.980
That's what ended VHS in beta when porn went to VHS.

18:53.980 --> 19:00.700
I think, though, they make a good point that if it's cheaper to produce, then the disc

19:00.700 --> 19:05.300
prices are going to be cheaper, but right now the retail for disc prices isn't any cheaper

19:05.300 --> 19:06.460
than Blu-Ray.

19:06.460 --> 19:11.880
So it comes down to the bottom line of price, what's going to cost these companies and what

19:11.880 --> 19:15.540
kind of a margin they can make on this stuff because it's cheaper to produce for.

19:15.540 --> 19:20.220
If it's going to be the same quality, then yeah, I think HD DVD is going to win out.

19:20.220 --> 19:22.580
This is why I'm simply saying the format wars are over.

19:22.580 --> 19:28.060
I don't mean to keep dogging on Sony, but look in the porn industry, and who doesn't

19:28.060 --> 19:29.060
love some porn?

19:29.060 --> 19:31.820
When they go for HD DVD, that's it.

19:31.820 --> 19:35.580
Well, Sony is really kind of known for failed formats anyways.

19:35.580 --> 19:38.420
I mean, let's see here, Betamax, UMD.

19:38.420 --> 19:40.980
Kick them while they're down, Loki.

19:40.980 --> 19:41.980
Kick them while they're down.

19:41.980 --> 19:48.540
I mean, hey, you know, I support Sony just as much, but it's there.

19:48.540 --> 19:57.060
Moving on, in New York State, Representative Keith Wright proposed legislation to block

19:57.060 --> 20:02.260
the sales of games that depict racist and religious violence to minors.

20:02.260 --> 20:11.500
The bill is A00547, and if it passed, it will block the sales of those games that glamorize

20:11.500 --> 20:16.300
violent crime, suicide, sexual violence, violent racism, religious violence, and illegal use

20:16.300 --> 20:18.980
of drugs or alcohol.

20:18.980 --> 20:24.420
He's also called for retailers to play such games in an adults-only section.

20:24.420 --> 20:33.900
Retailers would be required to check IDs for buyers under 30.

20:33.900 --> 20:38.460
Again the problem I have with this, who checks what games meet this criteria?

20:38.460 --> 20:41.060
What is considered violent?

20:41.060 --> 20:44.060
That's why we have the ESRB.

20:44.060 --> 20:48.100
I understand that, but I don't like it when I see these bills and they're so vague on

20:48.100 --> 20:52.700
we want to put violent games behind a closed curtain.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.660
Well, what's a violent game?

20:54.660 --> 21:02.620
This one actually has been going a bit more to define it, to define the violence at any

21:02.620 --> 21:03.620
rate.

21:03.620 --> 21:10.700
However, racism is, I mean, basically anybody can get offended over something if it remotely

21:10.700 --> 21:19.260
sounds racist to them, so I don't see how it's, and it works both ways too.

21:19.260 --> 21:25.700
I think that honestly, again, it's not the place of our government to decide what gets

21:25.700 --> 21:26.700
sold to who.

21:26.700 --> 21:30.980
I think it's the job of the parents to take a more active role in what their children

21:30.980 --> 21:32.700
are playing.

21:32.700 --> 21:38.800
Talk to them, look in every so often, but in the end, it's not the place of our government

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
to decide.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.140
We already have rating systems.

21:42.140 --> 21:49.140
Most retailers already can't sell anything that's rated M to a minor, so why is this

21:49.140 --> 21:50.140
necessary?

21:50.140 --> 21:54.780
All this is is wasting more taxpayer money.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.500
We hadn't done the FUs previously.

21:56.500 --> 22:01.060
All right, anyway, moving on, I want to talk a little bit about PC gaming.

22:01.060 --> 22:04.660
Remember, one of our New Year's resolutions was we were going to give some more love to

22:04.660 --> 22:09.740
PC gaming, and well, technically this is about Mac gaming, but that's okay.

22:09.740 --> 22:10.740
PC is personal computer.

22:10.740 --> 22:11.740
It's everything.

22:11.740 --> 22:17.060
So Mac fans are going to be in luck because it sounds like GameTap is planning to port

22:17.060 --> 22:23.060
Myst Online over to the Mac, and also Myst Online is going to be getting a whole new

22:23.060 --> 22:24.720
world to explore.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.980
It's kind of weird though because GameTap is actually not available on the Mac, and

22:28.980 --> 22:32.820
a lot of people say that's what's stopping them from getting on GameTap, and if GameTap

22:32.820 --> 22:35.860
could bring their pretty big library over to the Mac, that would be something else.

22:35.860 --> 22:39.460
Well, TransGaming is going to be the company that's actually going to bring the title over

22:39.460 --> 22:43.280
to the Mac, so that's kind of cool.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.480
No release as of yet.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.940
It's just announced that it's happening, but those folks were looking into getting into

22:47.940 --> 22:50.040
Myst Online.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.040
There you have it.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.780
You can do that on the Mac if you are so inclined.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.760
There you go.

22:55.760 --> 23:00.480
One cool game that's going to be coming to the PC, Monster Hunter, not a real huge franchise

23:00.480 --> 23:05.140
in the United States, but it is pretty big over in Japan.

23:05.140 --> 23:08.560
I think the last one they had was on the PSP.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
Pretty cool series.

23:09.560 --> 23:16.340
Kind of a cross between, almost like, Dynasty Warriors or Samurai Warriors and, say, Shadow

23:16.340 --> 23:17.780
of the Colossus.

23:17.780 --> 23:24.860
You're basically fighting dragons and stuff with really fantasy weapons and stuff like

23:24.860 --> 23:25.860
that.

23:25.860 --> 23:26.860
So, pretty cool.

23:26.860 --> 23:30.820
Now, hopefully, they'll bring it to 360 or PlayStation 3 or something like that.

23:30.820 --> 23:31.820
I'd like to see that.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.100
Or even a PlayStation 2 release of the ones that they have in Japan.

23:35.100 --> 23:38.980
Bandits was on the PS2 a while back, I think.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.620
I'm not sure in the United States, but I know it was in Japan.

23:41.620 --> 23:46.860
They've had a few in Japan.

23:46.860 --> 23:52.740
I think there was the one on PS2, because I remember seeing it at Dan's old store.

23:52.740 --> 23:53.740
Hmm.

23:53.740 --> 24:04.460
Well, at any rate, as far as other games, there's the Battlefield 2142 Northern Strike

24:04.460 --> 24:06.220
for the PC being worked on right now.

24:06.220 --> 24:07.620
EA's announced it.

24:07.620 --> 24:13.940
It's a booster pack being worked on by EA Digital Illusions Studio in Stockholm.

24:13.940 --> 24:15.940
Wow, that's Swedish.

24:15.940 --> 24:20.380
And it's scheduled for release in March 2007.

24:20.380 --> 24:27.420
It's going to be a futuristic conflict that's following a second ice age.

24:27.420 --> 24:33.460
They've released more details on the story, but it's also going to include three new maps,

24:33.460 --> 24:43.300
the World War II battle scene at the bridge of Remagen, Alpine Titan, and a liberation

24:43.300 --> 24:44.300
at Leipzig.

24:44.300 --> 24:48.260
So, it seems like it's got some stuff going on.

24:48.260 --> 24:55.220
Although, it seems to me most people prefer Battlefield 2 to Battlefield 2142.

24:55.220 --> 24:59.980
I played like yay much of Battlefield 2 and decided it wasn't my kind of game, but have

24:59.980 --> 25:01.900
you played a little more of this, Logie?

25:01.900 --> 25:02.900
Nope.

25:02.900 --> 25:03.900
Oh, I thought you had for some reason.

25:03.900 --> 25:08.500
Oh, I had it for free, and I don't try to play too much PC.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.380
In fact, the last PC game I played was Oblivion.

25:11.380 --> 25:16.740
I loaded it on there, and my laptop barely runs it.

25:16.740 --> 25:21.700
But, I played with a lot of cheat devices running at the same time, so I have my super

25:21.700 --> 25:22.700
powered character.

25:22.700 --> 25:28.060
So, it was fun going around and killing people from long distances away, unlocking spells

25:28.060 --> 25:35.060
that were in there for test purposes, and just plainly exerting my force over the citizens

25:35.060 --> 25:36.060
of a town.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.060
That's what I like.

25:37.060 --> 25:38.380
Why aren't you playing more PC games, man?

25:38.380 --> 25:41.260
I need to play more Fable.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.700
That's not really a PC game, though.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.580
Why aren't you playing more PC games?

25:44.580 --> 25:49.260
Because my PC's old, and because also I just don't have the time for it.

25:49.260 --> 25:51.540
I mean, I just don't have the time for it.

25:51.540 --> 25:54.260
You know, wife doesn't like playing games.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.260
I see.

25:55.260 --> 25:57.660
Well, maybe there'd be a PC game she likes.

25:57.660 --> 26:00.180
Desperate Housewives of the Game came out, didn't it?

26:00.180 --> 26:01.180
Should buy that for her.

26:01.180 --> 26:02.820
See if the wife likes that.

26:02.820 --> 26:03.820
No.

26:03.820 --> 26:07.860
But, that reminds me, though, I should probably load up The Sims 2 again so I can kill more

26:07.860 --> 26:08.860
Sims.

26:08.860 --> 26:12.380
Oh, and maybe get Sims 2 Pets so I can kill animals, too.

26:12.380 --> 26:17.820
All right, well, um, I wonder what you should, too bad you can't make them drink lots of

26:17.820 --> 26:18.820
water.

26:18.820 --> 26:19.820
Stop it.

26:19.820 --> 26:25.580
Moving back to the console world, you know, folks that have 360s that are, you know, on

26:25.580 --> 26:29.820
their last legs don't really want to have to send that back if they can help it.

26:29.820 --> 26:35.100
Kotaku ran an interesting story earlier this week about an old urban legend about how you

26:35.100 --> 26:37.500
can save a dying 360.

26:37.500 --> 26:42.360
They're saying that you can wrap your busted 360 in a towel, turn it on, leave it on for

26:42.360 --> 26:47.940
ten to fifteen minutes, turn it off, remove the towel, and turn it back on and it works.

26:47.940 --> 26:52.060
And apparently this will cure the three red rings of death.

26:52.060 --> 26:56.940
So this is just a rumor that they're running and apparently, you know, some commenters

26:56.940 --> 27:00.540
on the site say, you know, it does kind of make sense.

27:00.540 --> 27:04.740
One commenter on the site said it's kind of like a heat gun trick.

27:04.740 --> 27:09.180
Instead of using a heat gun, you're using the heat coming off the CPU because you're

27:09.180 --> 27:10.460
wrapping it up in the towels.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.460
It's not a good idea.

27:11.460 --> 27:12.460
Why?

27:12.460 --> 27:13.460
Just put it that way.

27:13.460 --> 27:14.460
It's not a good idea to do it.

27:14.460 --> 27:15.460
Why?

27:15.460 --> 27:20.220
Because before the thought was that they were overheating because the contact between the

27:20.220 --> 27:26.060
heat sink and the actual processor, whatever they would, you know, put in there, wasn't

27:26.060 --> 27:27.780
fully melted all the way.

27:27.780 --> 27:31.220
And so using the heat gun, you would melt that so it didn't have a better contact with

27:31.220 --> 27:33.980
the heat sink and it would cause it to not overheat.

27:33.980 --> 27:38.620
Well, by wrapping this whole thing in a towel, you may be, you know, duplicating that, but

27:38.620 --> 27:42.180
at the same time, you're overheating everything else and causing stuff to break.

27:42.180 --> 27:47.220
So in a sense, I guess if you have the three rings of death already, you might as well

27:47.220 --> 27:49.540
give it a shot because it's not going to hurt nothing.

27:49.540 --> 27:50.540
But I mean...

27:50.540 --> 27:51.540
Not going to help it either.

27:51.540 --> 27:52.540
It's not going to probably help it either.

27:52.540 --> 27:56.000
Well, JeremyTau1 says on the IGM message board, someone tried the towel trick and they said

27:56.000 --> 27:57.540
it actually worked.

27:57.540 --> 27:59.820
ActDeaf says, hey, I got the three rings of death.

27:59.820 --> 28:00.820
Just hit your 360.

28:00.820 --> 28:02.940
It really works.

28:02.940 --> 28:05.900
And then, of course, we have a comment from Drunami.

28:05.900 --> 28:11.740
Just give your 360 a lot of water.

28:11.740 --> 28:12.740
Submerge it.

28:12.740 --> 28:14.460
Topic change, please.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.100
Submerge it into the ocean.

28:16.100 --> 28:17.100
Topic change, please.

28:17.100 --> 28:21.900
Anyway, speaking of funny, crazy stuff, let's talk about our friend, Ken Kutaragi.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.900
Crayon Man!

28:22.900 --> 28:26.540
In 2006, he had a lot of crazy things to say.

28:26.540 --> 28:30.020
All the more reason I think that, you know, we should really get him to stop talking.

28:30.020 --> 28:35.260
But there is actually a website, though, that compiled a pretty interesting list of his

28:35.260 --> 28:38.040
quotes on PS3 today.

28:38.040 --> 28:42.720
And so we thought we would share some of them with you and maybe have some discussion about

28:42.720 --> 28:44.620
how crazy he is.

28:44.620 --> 28:47.780
First off, the PlayStation 3 is not a game machine.

28:47.780 --> 28:50.180
That was a quote from him.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.860
So not a game machine.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.060
I guess it's a computer.

28:54.060 --> 29:01.140
Anyways, being us for a short moment is like accidentally winning a point from a Sheerhan,

29:01.140 --> 29:05.240
a karate master, and Microsoft is still not a black belt.

29:05.240 --> 29:10.420
Just like with their operating systems, they might come out with something good around

29:10.420 --> 29:13.180
the third generation of their release.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.340
So I don't get that.

29:14.340 --> 29:17.340
That doesn't make any sense.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.340
Let's see here.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.340
Oh, this one's kind of funny.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.980
Microsoft shoots for the moon.

29:20.980 --> 29:21.980
So do you.

29:21.980 --> 29:22.980
Did you just say Microsoft?

29:22.980 --> 29:23.980
No, I think.

29:23.980 --> 29:26.060
We're all having topic problems or talking problems.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.060
See, I can't even talk.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.060
We're all having talking problems.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.060
I don't think that I've said anything.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.900
It's in the water in this town.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.980
The water not only is killing people, but it's making people stupid.

29:35.980 --> 29:38.140
Anyways, Microsoft shoots for the moon.

29:38.140 --> 29:43.980
Sony shoots for the sun.

29:43.980 --> 29:48.860
This time Microsoft has stated clearly that it's going after the PlayStation.

29:48.860 --> 29:55.360
However, not after the PlayStation 3, but the PlayStation 2, they were looking at 2

29:55.360 --> 29:59.960
and that's why Xbox 360 became like that.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.340
Because it's the second console from them, they're going after the second console from

30:03.340 --> 30:04.340
Sony.

30:04.340 --> 30:07.140
Yeah, no, that doesn't make any sense either.

30:07.140 --> 30:11.440
With PlayStation or the PlayStation 3, our intentions have been to create a machine with

30:11.440 --> 30:15.820
super computer calculation capabilities for home entertainment.

30:15.820 --> 30:16.820
Okay.

30:16.820 --> 30:19.520
All right.

30:19.520 --> 30:23.860
And then I'm trying to find the funniest one here.

30:23.860 --> 30:27.300
We're not going to equip the PlayStation 3 or the hard drive by default because no matter

30:27.300 --> 30:30.700
how much capacity we put in it, it won't be enough.

30:30.700 --> 30:34.900
Yeah, to load all those games that you're going to need to stream off your hard drive

30:34.900 --> 30:37.140
because the Blu-ray drive is too slow.

30:37.140 --> 30:38.700
Oh, this one's funny.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.180
All right, last one.

30:40.180 --> 30:43.580
The PlayStation 3 will instill discipline in our children and adults alike.

30:43.580 --> 30:47.500
Everyone will know discipline.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.420
Will the PS3 spank you when you're naughty?

30:49.420 --> 30:51.100
Is that the kind of discipline it's going to be?

30:51.100 --> 30:55.700
Because maybe I'd buy one if that's what it'll do.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.460
Because I need some discipline.

30:57.460 --> 30:59.900
The spank ray returns.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.900
Hooray.

31:01.900 --> 31:03.340
Old gaming reference there.

31:03.340 --> 31:07.820
What also returns this week as it shows up every week except the week we were off last

31:07.820 --> 31:10.160
week is DarkSakura's website of the week.

31:10.160 --> 31:14.440
She serves the internet up and down and left and right and back and forth and all over

31:14.440 --> 31:15.440
the place.

31:15.440 --> 31:19.760
In fact, I hear there's 13 different ways she can hold her internet including the mortar

31:19.760 --> 31:25.540
and pestle and she finds a website that she likes and shares it all with you here on our

31:25.540 --> 31:26.540
program.

31:26.540 --> 31:27.540
It's called DarkSakura's website of the week.

31:27.540 --> 31:28.540
See?

31:28.540 --> 31:29.540
It's something in the water.

31:29.540 --> 31:30.540
I don't drink the water, though.

31:30.540 --> 31:31.540
I had coffee.

31:31.540 --> 31:32.540
Coffee is made of water, stupid.

31:32.540 --> 31:33.540
I didn't use tap water, though.

31:33.540 --> 31:34.540
I used filtered water.

31:34.540 --> 31:35.540
I filter all the stupid out of it.

31:35.540 --> 31:36.540
Whatever.

31:36.540 --> 31:50.540
Anyway, the website of the week is YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com, best site ever.

31:50.540 --> 32:01.340
This site actually has downloadable notices that you can leave on people's cars like in

32:01.340 --> 32:03.940
fraction number one and fraction number two.

32:03.940 --> 32:09.020
They're available in PDF format and you can leave them on cars that you see parked badly

32:09.020 --> 32:14.020
as in double parking, being too close to the line where no one can get out of the car next

32:14.020 --> 32:15.860
to them.

32:15.860 --> 32:22.820
The best thing about it is that it has check marks that you can put on there to say, like,

32:22.820 --> 32:27.460
listed two spots, one car, a little too close, too far away from the driveway, too close

32:27.460 --> 32:32.420
to my driveway, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so

32:32.420 --> 32:38.100
cool car, move up, that's compact, and others so that you can walk it in.

32:38.100 --> 32:41.780
And there's a disclaimer that says, Parking is far too limited in our overcrowded streets

32:41.780 --> 32:44.780
and parking lots and you happen to park like an asshole.

32:44.780 --> 32:48.300
Go to the above website to see why someone else thought you parked like an asshole.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.620
Don't be too offended, we all do it one time or another, it just so happens that you got

32:51.620 --> 32:52.620
caught.

32:52.620 --> 32:56.460
Dude, Jamie, I'll give you a quarter to leave one on next to first car.

32:56.460 --> 32:58.700
Dude, I'd do it for free.

32:58.700 --> 33:01.140
Well, what was I going to say?

33:01.140 --> 33:03.140
And you can also send pictures to the site, too.

33:03.140 --> 33:07.700
They need the one that's like four corners, it's where you park in four spaces at once,

33:07.700 --> 33:10.620
you know, like just down the center of the crossing.

33:10.620 --> 33:13.180
I'm going to go to the site, look, I have a little printer right here, a little cheap

33:13.180 --> 33:17.860
ass $30 printer, I'm going to go to the site, first thing when I can, when the show is done,

33:17.860 --> 33:20.700
I'm going to print some out and carry them around in my car and I'll let you know how

33:20.700 --> 33:21.700
many I use.

33:21.700 --> 33:25.300
Actually, yesterday, when I was getting sushi, there were these people who were just parked,

33:25.300 --> 33:29.820
I mean, really freaking parked badly, like the line was in the middle of both of their

33:29.820 --> 33:30.820
cars.

33:30.820 --> 33:33.740
Well, how about they need the one on there that says this is not a parking spot, you

33:33.740 --> 33:38.380
know, it's like in the middle of the road or like double parked or just wherever.

33:38.380 --> 33:43.140
Well, also, you can, well, this is what I did, I actually just hand wrote notes and

33:43.140 --> 33:47.700
left diagrams pointing the proper way to park and the first one says, you park like an idiot,

33:47.700 --> 33:51.100
you learn how to do this when you're a teenager, don't do it again, and the other one was,

33:51.100 --> 33:53.620
you park like you're retarded, get back on the short bus.

33:53.620 --> 33:58.740
Wow, that's, what if the person, what if the person really was mentally challenged, that

33:58.740 --> 33:59.740
would have been, that would have been.

33:59.740 --> 34:00.740
Then they don't need to be driving.

34:00.740 --> 34:06.380
But this person was triple parked, I kid you not, not even for legitimate reasons, it was

34:06.380 --> 34:07.380
at a restaurant.

34:07.380 --> 34:12.540
Alright, real quick here, I got one more Ken Kutaragi quote, I missed this one, it says,

34:12.540 --> 34:16.620
if processors of high performance and wide bandwidth like the cell were linked together

34:16.620 --> 34:22.220
without sufficient security, a worldwide system crash could occur with one attack.

34:22.220 --> 34:26.020
Is there a site called YouTalkLikeAnAsshole.com?

34:26.020 --> 34:29.220
I don't know.

34:29.220 --> 34:34.820
Speaking of assholes, here's one in training, apparently a nine-year-old child stole their

34:34.820 --> 34:41.780
neighbor's car, got spotted by police on the interstate, guns it to a 90 mile an hour chase,

34:41.780 --> 34:46.520
the kid tried to take an exit ramp but the engine blew and the car hit a curb, went into

34:46.520 --> 34:48.820
a tree and the kid gets captured.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.220
How the hell did a nine-year-old learn to drive a car?

34:51.220 --> 34:56.500
I had to do so many loops in the parking lot at my high school with a driver's ed instructor

34:56.500 --> 34:58.840
before I was ever able to figure out how to drive.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.220
Same way I did, Ridge Racer.

35:01.220 --> 35:08.820
Well, yeah, you're not helping much because apparently according to what was going on

35:08.820 --> 35:14.420
is that the mom believed that PlayStation taught him how to do all this, so apparently

35:14.420 --> 35:18.220
either Grand Theft Auto or Ridge Racer, this is where he learned to drive and do all this

35:18.220 --> 35:19.980
and hightail it to get away from the cops.

35:19.980 --> 35:20.980
You're not helping Dark Soccer.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.540
Well, did you see the other part of this?

35:22.540 --> 35:24.340
They don't have accurate driving simulators.

35:24.340 --> 35:26.060
I think it was arcade games that did it.

35:26.060 --> 35:27.340
It's all Gran Turismo's fault.

35:27.340 --> 35:30.700
Did you see the real driving simulator?

35:30.700 --> 35:34.620
Anyways, did you see the rest of the story where they were talking about how he, before

35:34.620 --> 35:39.580
that, also recently evaded airport security, managing the Hoppa flight?

35:39.580 --> 35:42.260
No, they're trying to turn it into Chuck Norris.

35:42.260 --> 35:43.260
Come on.

35:43.260 --> 35:44.260
Oh, that'd be funny.

35:44.260 --> 35:49.380
See, that'd be cool if he actually did that because I'd give props to the kid, but yeah,

35:49.380 --> 35:51.300
I think, though, seriously...

35:51.300 --> 35:52.420
Props to the kid?

35:52.420 --> 35:55.380
That's my tax dollars paying to bust his ass.

35:55.380 --> 35:56.380
Fuck that.

35:56.380 --> 35:57.380
Put him in juvie.

35:57.380 --> 36:02.300
No, props to the kid because the parents should get, you know, fucking billed for something

36:02.300 --> 36:03.300
for this shit.

36:03.300 --> 36:05.920
I absolutely agree the parents should be billed for it all.

36:05.920 --> 36:10.740
My tax dollars should not go to pay for this stupid kid.

36:10.740 --> 36:12.700
Don't let little Billy in the goddamn car.

36:12.700 --> 36:13.700
It's a gateway to porn.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.700
Well, he stole the neighbor's car.

36:14.700 --> 36:15.700
He could drive to a porno shop.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.540
Where did he learn to steal a car?

36:17.540 --> 36:18.540
You can't...

36:18.540 --> 36:21.420
In a video game, you press X to steal the car.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.340
You did not go through the whole process.

36:23.340 --> 36:24.620
He didn't steal a car.

36:24.620 --> 36:25.620
Here's what happened.

36:25.620 --> 36:29.260
Little fucking, you know, mommy went into the store, Billy, stay in the car, I'm going

36:29.260 --> 36:32.380
to leave it running, got in the driver's seat and drove off.

36:32.380 --> 36:33.380
That's what happened.

36:33.380 --> 36:34.380
It said it was the neighbor's car.

36:34.380 --> 36:35.380
Well, fine.

36:35.380 --> 36:36.860
The neighbor let him into the car.

36:36.860 --> 36:38.880
What are they doing leaving their car unlocked?

36:38.880 --> 36:40.460
With the keys in the ignition.

36:40.460 --> 36:44.060
With a crazy nine-year-old in the neighborhood.

36:44.060 --> 36:47.620
Dennis the Menace, we're on to you.

36:47.620 --> 36:55.260
Anyways, so speaking of crazy driving and stuff, Burnout 5 is coming out and I cannot

36:55.260 --> 36:56.260
wait for that.

36:56.260 --> 37:01.100
And I know that, you know, apparently there's been some screenshots where pedestrians have

37:01.100 --> 37:02.100
been spotted.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.160
I can only hope that that were the case, but unfortunately I'm thinking this is from some

37:05.160 --> 37:07.460
sort of cut scene in the game.

37:07.460 --> 37:12.500
But if there's pedestrians and I can hit them going 200 miles an hour, that sold the game

37:12.500 --> 37:13.740
twice to me right there.

37:13.740 --> 37:14.740
Seriously, me too.

37:14.740 --> 37:19.020
I'm like, seriously, if there's actually pedestrians on the road that like run away from your car

37:19.020 --> 37:22.940
and stuff, oh my God, did I just buy this game like three times.

37:22.940 --> 37:27.540
Burnout is so hot to begin with, like it's one of my favorite racers.

37:27.540 --> 37:28.540
It really is awesome.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.540
Except for the soundtracks.

37:29.540 --> 37:30.540
I always change.

37:30.540 --> 37:31.540
That's why I love 360.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.940
You can just change out the soundtrack.

37:32.940 --> 37:35.260
But oh man, oh man.

37:35.260 --> 37:39.660
I want an M-rated game, oh fuck that, you know, an adult-only game where I can blow

37:39.660 --> 37:40.660
these people.

37:40.660 --> 37:46.180
I want to see blood splatters and skull fragments shattering into my window.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.180
That'd be awesome.

37:47.180 --> 37:53.020
Seriously, I think if, you know, especially with Rockstar and the next Grand Theft Auto

37:53.020 --> 37:57.580
game, hell, just to go adult-only and just fucking go crazy.

37:57.580 --> 37:59.060
Go fucking nuts.

37:59.060 --> 38:02.740
Just have a normal, like, do like movies, you know, have a rated version of the game

38:02.740 --> 38:04.740
and have the underrated, you know.

38:04.740 --> 38:10.540
That way you can still sell as many copies and, you know, some people will buy the underrated

38:10.540 --> 38:15.300
where you can fucking blow people up and have skull fragments, you know, slam into your

38:15.300 --> 38:16.300
car.

38:16.300 --> 38:20.380
It'd be cool, though, if like the skull fragments could impale other people and embed in their

38:20.380 --> 38:21.860
skulls and kill them.

38:21.860 --> 38:22.860
Yeah.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.260
That'd be fantastic.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.260
Anyway.

38:25.260 --> 38:27.060
You guys are morbid.

38:27.060 --> 38:28.060
I am not.

38:28.060 --> 38:31.980
I would love to read some chat comments right now, but I just totally got booted from chat.

38:31.980 --> 38:33.980
I pinged out, so I'm trying to get back to you.

38:33.980 --> 38:34.980
I'll read chat comments.

38:34.980 --> 38:35.980
Thank you.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.980
Is there anything interesting?

38:36.980 --> 38:37.980
Dark Sakura is awesome.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.980
Real ones, please.

38:39.980 --> 38:48.540
They're just like saying a yay burnout and red asphalt, someone said.

38:48.540 --> 38:49.540
Ouch.

38:49.540 --> 38:59.660
But moving on to the next story, speaking of fun violence, we have Calling All Cars,

38:59.660 --> 39:05.420
formerly known as Criminal Crackdown, which is supposed to be a mix of stuff like Bomberman

39:05.420 --> 39:10.740
and Twisted Metal and Demolition Derby with explosions and crashes and criminals and crashes

39:10.740 --> 39:12.460
and more crashes and more crashes.

39:12.460 --> 39:14.500
It kind of looks like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.500
I know.

39:15.500 --> 39:20.100
It has that same sort of, well, it's more of a diagonally overhead view, I think.

39:20.100 --> 39:27.300
But Sony Computer Entertainment is saying that it would be out by March.

39:27.300 --> 39:29.980
So let's hope so.

39:29.980 --> 39:31.980
That looks kind of fun to me.

39:31.980 --> 39:35.220
I love exploding stuff.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.540
I love the description here.

39:36.540 --> 39:45.060
It says Tom and Jerry type violence with mass destruction.

39:45.060 --> 39:46.060
Sounds interesting.

39:46.060 --> 39:47.060
All right.

39:47.060 --> 39:52.820
Well, we're going to take your calls pretty soon on our Skype line, which is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.120
The username is Skype.

39:54.120 --> 39:57.780
But one other thing that that phone line can be used for is to leave voicemails when we're

39:57.780 --> 39:58.900
not here.

39:58.900 --> 40:13.780
We like to play some of our favorite voicemails on the air when we're not able to take your

40:13.780 --> 40:14.780
calls live.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.380
And we're going to play some of those voicemails right now.

40:16.380 --> 40:19.020
We got some really good ones from the last couple shows.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.580
So here's our first voicemail.

40:20.580 --> 40:21.580
This one's about two minutes.

40:21.580 --> 40:22.580
Hi.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.340
This is Razorburn 2021.

40:24.340 --> 40:26.820
I wanted to make some comments on last week's show.

40:26.820 --> 40:32.340
I just got done with my weekly listen, and ParadoxVincent's call about Wii Sports kind

40:32.340 --> 40:37.420
of got me thinking about a problem I've been having for the last couple of gens with Nintendo

40:37.420 --> 40:38.420
product.

40:38.420 --> 40:42.580
It's one of the things that kind of held me back from really getting into it, and it's

40:42.580 --> 40:47.260
kind of a Nintendo fanaticism.

40:47.260 --> 40:55.540
Guys like ParadoxVincent, if you can't look at a game like Wii Sports, I mean, I'm huge.

40:55.540 --> 40:59.740
I really, really enjoy Gears of War, but I can look at it and see why there are people

40:59.740 --> 41:01.020
that won't like it.

41:01.020 --> 41:04.860
I can see why people would see it as boring or that it just doesn't have the flair they're

41:04.860 --> 41:05.860
looking for.

41:05.860 --> 41:10.460
If you can't look at Wii Sports and see why a critic would bash it, I think you've really

41:10.460 --> 41:13.980
kind of let yourself get a little too into Nintendo.

41:13.980 --> 41:18.260
There's this feeling out there that Nintendo can do no wrong, and I think Graybush, when

41:18.260 --> 41:23.780
you had your interview, touched on a little bit that most systems have fans that are way,

41:23.780 --> 41:28.860
way harder on their games than Nintendo, because I think right now Wii fanatics are kind of

41:28.860 --> 41:33.900
really thirsty for every game to be this, specifically the Nintendo titles, to be a

41:33.900 --> 41:34.900
huge success.

41:34.900 --> 41:40.020
I've heard stories from most podcasts I listen to about, well, over the holidays I took it

41:40.020 --> 41:44.460
and my grandma wanted to play Wii Sports, but yeah, I mean, I've heard that a lot that

41:44.460 --> 41:48.420
how many of your grandmas really are going out and buying a Wii.

41:48.420 --> 41:52.220
You say, well, Grandma came over and she wanted to talk to me about Wii, but I mean, how many

41:52.220 --> 41:57.140
of the grandmas are sitting around the hair parlor and saying, well, where's Edith?

41:57.140 --> 41:59.380
Last week I played Wii Bowling!

41:59.380 --> 42:01.940
Gaming has come a long way, but I think it's come a long way.

42:01.940 --> 42:06.140
I'm sure your grandpa will play Wii Sports with you, but I don't think, you know, he

42:06.140 --> 42:07.140
was a nom.

42:07.140 --> 42:08.700
He's not going to sit down and play elephants.

42:08.700 --> 42:14.540
I think that you need to be able to see both sides of an argument to really be a gamer,

42:14.540 --> 42:18.140
and I think if you're really looking at the Wii from this perspective of there's going

42:18.140 --> 42:22.660
to be this rude awakening because everybody can get into it, I think that's looking at

42:22.660 --> 42:23.660
it wrong.

42:23.660 --> 42:28.260
I think that if you're someone who's a true gamer, you know, maybe it should bother you

42:28.260 --> 42:32.940
a little bit that everything's being simplified so that everyone can be into it.

42:32.940 --> 42:37.980
I'm being kind of rambly now and now my call's gone too long, so I'm just going to let you

42:37.980 --> 42:38.980
go.

42:38.980 --> 42:39.980
Love you.

42:39.980 --> 42:42.960
Well, thank you very much for the voicemail.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.420
We appreciate it.

42:44.420 --> 42:47.420
You know, it's kind of interesting.

42:47.420 --> 42:50.380
I'm kind of trying to think back to the show when that was taped and kind of everything

42:50.380 --> 42:53.900
that we said that was going on there.

42:53.900 --> 42:57.780
I don't think it's necessarily that Nintendo can do no wrong, because certainly at least

42:57.780 --> 43:01.100
us here in the studio pointed out many faults that Nintendo's done.

43:01.100 --> 43:04.620
We were just making fun of Red Steel earlier, although granted that's a third-party title,

43:04.620 --> 43:06.780
but most people would say, hey, it's a mistake.

43:06.780 --> 43:08.020
Nintendo's not online right now.

43:08.020 --> 43:12.460
They should have made some different decisions maybe with the Wii, and they're certainly

43:12.460 --> 43:14.100
capable of doing things that are wrong.

43:14.100 --> 43:17.740
I just think maybe folks thought that that particular review on Wii Sports was really

43:17.740 --> 43:22.220
harsh because of the fact that so many people can pick up and go with Wii Sports.

43:22.220 --> 43:26.940
I suppose you're right that grandmas and grandpas aren't exactly buying Wiis, and that's what

43:26.940 --> 43:28.100
it's all about.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.980
But I think not so much grandmas and grandpas, but parents.

43:30.980 --> 43:35.420
I think if parents feel like they could get into a video game system with their children,

43:35.420 --> 43:37.860
I think that's what could really sell the Wii systems right there.

43:37.860 --> 43:42.460
I think that's kind of the thing that maybe that particular caller was going for in that

43:42.460 --> 43:43.460
call.

43:43.460 --> 43:47.780
But certainly Nintendo is not without their own faults.

43:47.780 --> 43:51.580
Wii Sports may not have been on my top ten of the year necessarily, but I thought it

43:51.580 --> 43:54.300
was a good game and better than average.

43:54.300 --> 43:58.700
I don't think it was deserving of a negative review, but I suppose everybody has their

43:58.700 --> 43:59.700
opinions.

43:59.700 --> 44:00.700
Thanks for the voicemail, though.

44:00.700 --> 44:01.700
That was kind of funny.

44:01.700 --> 44:02.700
I like that.

44:02.700 --> 44:03.700
You're a funny guy.

44:03.700 --> 44:04.700
All right.

44:04.700 --> 44:06.980
Let's go to our next voicemail and our last voicemail of the week.

44:06.980 --> 44:07.980
Hey, guys.

44:07.980 --> 44:10.540
This is Mr. Wonderful from the forum.

44:10.540 --> 44:14.540
I just wanted to chime in with what Sky was saying on the most recent show about gaming

44:14.540 --> 44:16.740
journalism being in for a rude awakening.

44:16.740 --> 44:17.740
I couldn't agree more.

44:17.740 --> 44:22.260
I'm a gaming journalist myself, and for too long the gaming journalism community has really

44:22.260 --> 44:26.460
just been focusing on what they perceive to be hardcore and trying to tell the community

44:26.460 --> 44:30.960
about what's new and hardcore and underground, but they're a mainstream publication.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.060
They need to appeal to all walks of life.

44:33.060 --> 44:36.660
They need to appeal to the gaming public as a whole, not just niches.

44:36.660 --> 44:40.740
So I think that the Wii is going to provide a huge awakening, it's going to provide a

44:40.740 --> 44:46.900
revolution, if you will, of this community, because journalists can't just say, you know,

44:46.900 --> 44:51.020
Gears of War is the greatest game ever because, you know, Cliffy B made it and all this.

44:51.020 --> 44:54.900
There's a lot of new gamers out there who don't know who Cliffy B is and probably don't

44:54.900 --> 44:55.900
care.

44:55.900 --> 44:59.060
They're going to have to start covering more, a wider range of topics, and they're going

44:59.060 --> 45:02.140
to have to start backing up claims, going to start.

45:02.140 --> 45:05.620
I think we're going to see a new age of gaming magazines.

45:05.620 --> 45:10.180
They can't just keep continuing on the path they're on or this huge audience that Nintendo

45:10.180 --> 45:15.140
has got is not going to be buying their magazines if they don't understand a damn word of them.

45:15.140 --> 45:19.100
So yeah, I agree pretty much wholeheartedly with what you're saying.

45:19.100 --> 45:23.380
It's going to be an interesting time for journalism as well as gaming, and I can't wait to see

45:23.380 --> 45:27.460
where it goes, but if somebody doesn't pick up on this trend that there's non-gamers that

45:27.460 --> 45:31.820
are gaming now, then I don't think they're going to get into it, whereas if there is

45:31.820 --> 45:36.820
a magazine out there that caters to this idea that people who haven't played games and don't

45:36.820 --> 45:42.420
know as much about the history or the culture of gaming, and kind of a my first gaming magazine,

45:42.420 --> 45:46.180
if you will, I think something like that could have huge success.

45:46.180 --> 45:49.140
So I'd really like to see something like that happen.

45:49.140 --> 45:51.020
Great show and keep up the great work.

45:51.020 --> 45:53.020
Looking forward to the next one.

45:53.020 --> 45:54.020
Take it easy, guys.

45:54.020 --> 45:55.020
Thank you very much for the voicemail.

45:55.020 --> 45:56.020
We appreciate it.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.020
I don't know.

45:57.020 --> 45:58.020
What do you guys think?

45:58.020 --> 45:59.740
Again, this goes back to the whole casual gaming magazine.

45:59.740 --> 46:04.660
Although I agree with what the guy is saying, because he was agreeing with me, I don't know

46:04.660 --> 46:07.860
if I necessarily think, and kind of reflecting and thinking about that, I don't know if a

46:07.860 --> 46:12.580
casual gaming magazine would really sell, because people usually buy magazines for their

46:12.580 --> 46:16.100
hobbies and the things they're really into, so I don't know if necessarily a casual gaming

46:16.100 --> 46:19.620
magazine would sell, but I kind of go back to something I had referenced on that particular

46:19.620 --> 46:24.080
show where I said magazines like Entertainment Weekly and so on need to expand on their gaming

46:24.080 --> 46:30.660
sections and magazines that are dedicated to entertainment and those types of things

46:30.660 --> 46:35.340
in general should look at these things from a casual game perspective.

46:35.340 --> 46:38.340
That was my thought.

46:38.340 --> 46:40.260
Anything else you guys want to add?

46:40.260 --> 46:43.980
I don't know.

46:43.980 --> 46:49.100
I'm just glad that they have the perspectives out there for casual gamers as well as a hardcore

46:49.100 --> 46:53.980
gamer because a lot of people just don't really get the perspectives of the other person.

46:53.980 --> 46:58.380
So it's kind of good that they have that kind of stuff out there.

46:58.380 --> 47:01.740
DJ Morpheus in chat says, why doesn't OLR play hate voicemails?

47:01.740 --> 47:02.740
Because everyone loves us.

47:02.740 --> 47:03.740
We don't get hate voicemails.

47:03.740 --> 47:04.740
Start sending them in.

47:04.740 --> 47:09.140
Yeah, call and leave us some, I don't know.

47:09.140 --> 47:11.820
We listen to them and get a chuckle out of it and then we delete it.

47:11.820 --> 47:18.060
Let's see, James Patrick has a good comment, saying Nintendo fans are crazy is stupid.

47:18.060 --> 47:22.220
Madden fans, GTA fans, a lot of fans are just as bad.

47:22.220 --> 47:29.540
SSJ 100 Matt has an interesting comment.

47:29.540 --> 47:32.300
Some Nintendo fanboys are getting as bad as Scientologists.

47:32.300 --> 47:36.500
When someone says something bad about it, they go on the offensive, like the Zelda 8.8

47:36.500 --> 47:37.500
rating.

47:37.500 --> 47:41.900
I agree people got their panties way too ruffled over that one.

47:41.900 --> 47:46.660
People in general should just realize it's just some dude's opinion who happens to work

47:46.660 --> 47:49.980
for a big website that all you people visit.

47:49.980 --> 47:53.920
I don't know why, but you do and you apparently listen to what they have to say, but in the

47:53.920 --> 48:00.220
end it's just one dude's opinion.

48:00.220 --> 48:05.500
What makes these people any more qualified than you, you or me?

48:05.500 --> 48:08.700
I mean, I realize they went to journalism school, they know how to write and they have

48:08.700 --> 48:11.860
a love of games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and all that stuff.

48:11.860 --> 48:14.060
But I have a love of games.

48:14.060 --> 48:18.980
You that listened and downloaded this video game podcast has a love of games.

48:18.980 --> 48:23.420
So these guys know their spelling and their grammar and how to write a good review.

48:23.420 --> 48:24.660
That's about it.

48:24.660 --> 48:29.340
It doesn't always mean, I mean, I don't think, to be honest, that a lot of these people have

48:29.340 --> 48:31.620
gone to journalism school.

48:31.620 --> 48:33.900
I think they're just being hired, so.

48:33.900 --> 48:38.180
I could almost, in fact, I know for a fact not all of them have.

48:38.180 --> 48:40.180
I know that for a fact.

48:40.180 --> 48:44.060
Oh well, that's what we got.

48:44.060 --> 48:45.060
Any more news?

48:45.060 --> 48:49.340
Yes, we definitely have some new stuff.

48:49.340 --> 48:51.740
So this was pretty exciting.

48:51.740 --> 48:56.780
All week long they've been kind of teasing stuff, starting off with a YouTube video of

48:56.780 --> 48:58.580
some prototype footage of it.

48:58.580 --> 49:04.620
Brand new Ghostbusters game and it's being produced by a company called ZootFly and right

49:04.620 --> 49:07.780
now it's something that they're developing right now, they're working on it.

49:07.780 --> 49:12.220
Problem is, of course, they're being held up by a lot of the licensing issues, you know,

49:12.220 --> 49:15.580
with the movie, etc.

49:15.580 --> 49:20.460
So it's something that's being currently worked on, but it looks pretty cool so far.

49:20.460 --> 49:25.580
And right now, on top of the Ghostbusters game, ZootFly is also working on another game

49:25.580 --> 49:31.100
called Time Zero and it's basically, it's kind of related to Ghostbusters a little bit,

49:31.100 --> 49:39.500
talks about two adventurers who are die-hard New Yorkers and they get trapped in a deep,

49:39.500 --> 49:43.940
like the shadow world of a parallel New York and the city itself is actually a war machine

49:43.940 --> 49:47.180
threatening to wipe out the world and they have three days to stop it.

49:47.180 --> 49:51.140
So that's kind of neat, they're working on that and I know they're also working on another

49:51.140 --> 49:56.700
game called Toy Wars, which is coming to the Xbox Live Arcade, which looks pretty cool

49:56.700 --> 49:57.700
too.

49:57.700 --> 50:04.500
So hopefully people, you know, so far the response has been pretty good on it and a

50:04.500 --> 50:09.060
lot of fans want to see this thing made, so hopefully a publisher jumps on this and gets

50:09.060 --> 50:14.820
the licensing rights paid for and hopefully we see this game, you know, come to fruition.

50:14.820 --> 50:15.820
Alright.

50:15.820 --> 50:21.180
Well, that sounds pretty cool and I like that screenshot of the toy game that you showed

50:21.180 --> 50:23.580
me and that's kind of cool.

50:23.580 --> 50:24.580
Yeah.

50:24.580 --> 50:25.820
Is this something you'll probably buy?

50:25.820 --> 50:27.060
It would be.

50:27.060 --> 50:29.580
I like Ghostbusters, I think it'd be fun.

50:29.580 --> 50:30.680
Will it have the song in it?

50:30.680 --> 50:31.680
That's all I want to know.

50:31.680 --> 50:36.580
Um, actually the song is different, they have a rock version of it in the video that they

50:36.580 --> 50:38.300
were showing, so I liked it.

50:38.300 --> 50:39.300
I thought it was pretty cool.

50:39.300 --> 50:40.300
Alright.

50:40.300 --> 50:41.300
Very cool.

50:41.300 --> 50:42.300
Alright.

50:42.300 --> 50:44.940
Well, this is the point of the show where we're going to open up the Skype line.

50:44.940 --> 50:48.860
If you want to give us a call, our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype or you can give

50:48.860 --> 50:53.580
us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR, which is toll free in the US and Canada.

50:53.580 --> 50:59.820
Sorry, UK folks and those in other countries, whether it be Australia, wherever you're at,

50:59.820 --> 51:03.740
you'll have to use the old fashioned method of calling us on Skype, which I guess isn't

51:03.740 --> 51:06.060
really old fashioned, but for us it is.

51:06.060 --> 51:07.060
Let's go to the phones.

51:07.060 --> 51:09.140
I'm getting a lot of calls tonight already.

51:09.140 --> 51:11.020
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:11.020 --> 51:12.020
Who's this?

51:12.020 --> 51:13.020
Hey, what's up?

51:13.020 --> 51:14.020
It's the Rob D in chat.

51:14.020 --> 51:15.020
Hey, the Rob D in chat.

51:15.020 --> 51:16.020
I like your name.

51:16.020 --> 51:17.020
Thank you.

51:17.020 --> 51:18.020
What's on your mind, buddy?

51:18.020 --> 51:19.020
Not too much.

51:19.020 --> 51:23.220
I was just going to talk about that one article you read about how the Wii is a gateway to

51:23.220 --> 51:24.220
porn.

51:24.220 --> 51:28.260
By the way, I just want to say before we start getting into this, I want to say Rob D's quality

51:28.260 --> 51:30.020
is like perfect right now.

51:30.020 --> 51:32.980
I'm loving this call because I don't hear myself echoing in the background.

51:32.980 --> 51:33.980
No static.

51:33.980 --> 51:34.980
No static.

51:34.980 --> 51:36.700
I can hear his volume is perfect.

51:36.700 --> 51:38.700
This is a model phone call, boys and girls.

51:38.700 --> 51:39.700
I applaud you.

51:39.700 --> 51:41.220
You have a good enunciation.

51:41.220 --> 51:42.220
I do.

51:42.220 --> 51:46.140
I applaud you, Rob D. Not to knock on the other callers because I realize it's internet

51:46.140 --> 51:50.020
radio and what have you, but Rob D, whatever you've done to set yourself up, you need to

51:50.020 --> 51:51.780
share that with everybody.

51:51.780 --> 51:52.780
It's great.

51:52.780 --> 51:53.780
Sounds great.

51:53.780 --> 51:54.780
All right.

51:54.780 --> 51:55.780
So the Wii porn story.

51:55.780 --> 51:56.780
What do you want to say?

51:56.780 --> 51:57.780
All right.

51:57.780 --> 52:00.300
So basically, I don't know if you actually covered this.

52:00.300 --> 52:04.700
I unfortunately was watching part of the Colts game, so I was kind of halfway listening to

52:04.700 --> 52:06.180
OLR.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.180
We forgive you.

52:07.180 --> 52:08.180
Yeah.

52:08.180 --> 52:09.180
I'm sorry.

52:09.180 --> 52:10.180
Okay.

52:10.180 --> 52:14.220
So I don't know if you covered this, but did you read the quote from a supposed child where

52:14.220 --> 52:18.080
he said, the first thing I did when I got the Wii was think about porn or something

52:18.080 --> 52:19.080
like that?

52:19.080 --> 52:20.080
Yeah.

52:20.080 --> 52:21.640
Something that the website had got from their blog.

52:21.640 --> 52:24.780
They went and looked at a blog and say, hey, one child said on their blog that the first

52:24.780 --> 52:29.220
thing I thought about when I got the Wii was porn or it was the Wii browser.

52:29.220 --> 52:32.140
First thing I thought about when the Wii browser was porn.

52:32.140 --> 52:34.900
So I was curious about that since it mentioned that it was a blog.

52:34.900 --> 52:38.540
I plugged the quote into Google just to see where it was from.

52:38.540 --> 52:40.140
Ah, good thinking, my friend.

52:40.140 --> 52:41.860
Where did it come from?

52:41.860 --> 52:43.740
It's from a post on Kotaku.

52:43.740 --> 52:44.740
On where?

52:44.740 --> 52:45.740
Kotaku.

52:45.740 --> 52:46.740
Really?

52:46.740 --> 52:47.980
It was a comment to some random article.

52:47.980 --> 52:48.980
I forget what it was.

52:48.980 --> 52:55.300
Oh, I thought you were going to say MySpace.

52:55.300 --> 52:59.140
That's interesting because then how would they know that it was a child because Kotaku's

52:59.140 --> 53:02.060
commenting system doesn't tell a person their age, right?

53:02.060 --> 53:04.820
Well, here's what's actually funny about this.

53:04.820 --> 53:12.180
The comment immediately preceding that quote was, as a male aged 18 to 35.

53:12.180 --> 53:17.460
And I kid you not, that's exactly what it was.

53:17.460 --> 53:20.880
And he is quoted as a child in that article.

53:20.880 --> 53:23.220
So they're totally stretching the facts and stuff.

53:23.220 --> 53:24.220
Not surprising.

53:24.220 --> 53:30.500
I'll find the web page and shove it in chat just to verify that I'm not pulling this out

53:30.500 --> 53:31.500
of nowhere.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.500
No, I believe you.

53:32.500 --> 53:36.460
I believe the power of Google is an amazing thing.

53:36.460 --> 53:37.460
But that's kind of funny.

53:37.460 --> 53:43.420
I just thought that the fact that they just took things totally out of context is rather

53:43.420 --> 53:44.420
interesting.

53:44.420 --> 53:47.540
Someone needs to email WPAA and ask them to explain themselves.

53:47.540 --> 53:51.900
Yeah, and this is almost as good as that one article a year ago about how the PSP pulls

53:51.900 --> 53:53.100
porn out of thin air.

53:53.100 --> 53:57.620
Oh, some folks in chat don't know what Kotaku is, so we should say it's a big gaming blog.

53:57.620 --> 54:03.820
If you know Destructoid or even like IGN and GameSpot's news feed, it's very similar.

54:03.820 --> 54:04.820
It's just a game blog.

54:04.820 --> 54:07.820
You can put an RSS in your reader and get all their news and stuff.

54:07.820 --> 54:08.820
That's what Kotaku is.

54:08.820 --> 54:12.180
I'm sorry, what was the other thing you were saying?

54:12.180 --> 54:19.500
I was saying it's almost as good as the article about a year ago when it said that the PSP

54:19.500 --> 54:21.980
pulled porn out of thin air.

54:21.980 --> 54:23.860
It made up porn.

54:23.860 --> 54:24.860
Exactly.

54:24.860 --> 54:29.660
Like, hey, dude, if the PS3 would pull porn out of thin air, I'd buy it.

54:29.660 --> 54:31.660
Oh, and no Blu-ray, doesn't it?

54:31.660 --> 54:33.700
Yeah, now we do.

54:33.700 --> 54:37.100
It actually reminds me of the story where we had the DS.

54:37.100 --> 54:41.340
And remember that the one TV news station did a story about child predators on the DS

54:41.340 --> 54:42.340
in PictoChat?

54:42.340 --> 54:46.100
That's what it reminds me of.

54:46.100 --> 54:47.220
Too many penis drawings?

54:47.220 --> 54:52.380
No, the fact that like, oh my gosh, your four-year-old might be playing on the Nintendo DS and a

54:52.380 --> 54:55.740
child predator could write something sexual on it.

54:55.740 --> 55:00.580
But what people forget is that if somebody's doing that, that person is in the room with

55:00.580 --> 55:01.580
you.

55:01.580 --> 55:04.300
Those DSes do not have that huge a range.

55:04.300 --> 55:05.780
I don't know.

55:05.780 --> 55:08.220
All right, well, anyway, that's all I had to say.

55:08.220 --> 55:10.340
That's what was going on at E3 a couple of years ago.

55:10.340 --> 55:11.340
Well, that's different.

55:11.340 --> 55:12.340
That's E3.

55:12.340 --> 55:13.980
You put all the nerds in a room and that's what's going to happen.

55:13.980 --> 55:15.620
All right, Rob D. We appreciate the call.

55:15.620 --> 55:16.620
Lincoln Chat, by the way.

55:16.620 --> 55:17.620
What?

55:17.620 --> 55:18.620
What's that?

55:18.620 --> 55:19.620
I tossed a Lincoln Chat.

55:19.620 --> 55:20.620
Oh, great, thank you.

55:20.620 --> 55:21.620
We'll take a look at that.

55:21.620 --> 55:22.620
Anyway, thanks for taking my call.

55:22.620 --> 55:23.620
I'll see you guys later.

55:23.620 --> 55:24.620
No problem.

55:24.620 --> 55:25.620
Have a good one, buddy.

55:25.620 --> 55:26.620
Thanks for the call.

55:26.620 --> 55:27.620
Model O-L-R phone call.

55:27.620 --> 55:31.380
Yes, it looks like, of course, since I said that, he did cut out a couple times during

55:31.380 --> 55:33.300
the call, but that's just probably our connection.

55:33.300 --> 55:36.620
That's all the people playing fucking World of Warcraft in the other room that's causing

55:36.620 --> 55:37.620
that.

55:37.620 --> 55:38.620
That's what's up.

55:38.620 --> 55:40.420
Let's go to another call.

55:40.420 --> 55:41.740
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

55:41.740 --> 55:42.740
Who's this?

55:42.740 --> 55:46.300
It's everyone's favorite caller, Raven's Dolphin.

55:46.300 --> 55:47.980
Oh, Raven's Dolphin.

55:47.980 --> 55:52.100
What can we do for you this week, buddy?

55:52.100 --> 55:53.220
Absolutely nothing.

55:53.220 --> 55:57.820
I just want to comment on the Wii thing and the PSP thing.

55:57.820 --> 56:00.220
I just have to say this first.

56:00.220 --> 56:04.980
You're becoming quite the famous little caller of Internet radio programs I'm noticing.

56:04.980 --> 56:07.620
Yeah, I figured that.

56:07.620 --> 56:12.460
You should start your own show.

56:12.460 --> 56:15.900
Not that I'm discouraging you from calling into programs, but it's obvious you have a

56:15.900 --> 56:17.660
lot to say.

56:17.660 --> 56:23.140
If we haven't proven this fact, any schmo with a microphone can do a show, you should

56:23.140 --> 56:25.580
think about it.

56:25.580 --> 56:26.820
I was thinking about it.

56:26.820 --> 56:28.500
I'm definitely thinking about it.

56:28.500 --> 56:33.180
It's just the thing about it is money, and can I keep it going for an hour?

56:33.180 --> 56:37.820
DJ Morpheus says, how about a show of clips of him just calling into other shows?

56:37.820 --> 56:40.420
That's a brilliant idea.

56:40.420 --> 56:41.820
I'm just fucking with you, Raven's Dolphin.

56:41.820 --> 56:42.820
What's on your mind, really?

56:42.820 --> 56:43.820
I'm sorry.

56:43.820 --> 56:49.540
I just want to say that I watched that clip of the Wii, when they talk about the people

56:49.540 --> 56:50.540
pouring.

56:50.540 --> 56:54.820
The two girls that had the Wii, they took it in and I pushed pause, and they didn't

56:54.820 --> 56:55.820
even have the Internet browser.

56:55.820 --> 56:59.220
I didn't even have the Internet at all.

56:59.220 --> 57:01.860
Oh, so you watched the clip on the TV site?

57:01.860 --> 57:05.340
You watched a clip of the girls playing with the Wii, and they didn't even have the Internet

57:05.340 --> 57:06.340
channel on it?

57:06.340 --> 57:08.340
They didn't even have it, honest.

57:08.340 --> 57:13.940
They went to the news channel like, look, it's a game with the porn, and I don't

57:13.940 --> 57:15.540
even think they even have Internet.

57:15.540 --> 57:23.300
You have to download it off the Wii, but there are so many different things you have to do.

57:23.300 --> 57:31.060
Your quality is kind of screwing up there, buddy, but damn the media for doing that.

57:31.060 --> 57:35.660
Somebody probably said something to someone, and they create this story around it.

57:35.660 --> 57:36.660
That's kind of how it works.

57:36.660 --> 57:41.020
You know, I studied broadcast journalism in college, and I'll tell you what, usually

57:41.020 --> 57:44.620
what it is is just like, here's an idea, run with it, and make a story out of it.

57:44.620 --> 57:45.900
So that's what happened.

57:45.900 --> 57:48.140
Somebody told somebody, hey, did you know the Wii can get porn?

57:48.140 --> 57:53.860
Some reporter did their job and made a compelling story out of it by fabricating a few truths

57:53.860 --> 57:54.860
here and there.

57:54.860 --> 58:01.020
Yeah, I just feel like TV is just failing me now.

58:01.020 --> 58:04.500
You have to take some of the things that you hear on the news with a grain of salt, unfortunately,

58:04.500 --> 58:06.980
especially these types of investigation stories.

58:06.980 --> 58:11.540
It's one thing to report on a fire that's engulfed an entire neighborhood or whatever,

58:11.540 --> 58:17.260
and it's another thing to report on these types of moral issues.

58:17.260 --> 58:20.480
I'm hoping to get a live 365 stream soon.

58:20.480 --> 58:22.780
It's just a matter of money.

58:22.780 --> 58:28.540
Good luck to you, Ravenstaufen, and if you get your own show, we've got your back.

58:28.540 --> 58:29.540
Thank you.

58:29.540 --> 58:31.180
I have your back, too.

58:31.180 --> 58:32.180
We know.

58:32.180 --> 58:33.740
Have a good one, buddy.

58:33.740 --> 58:34.740
You too.

58:34.740 --> 58:35.740
Bye.

58:35.740 --> 58:36.740
Later.

58:36.740 --> 58:37.740
All right.

58:37.740 --> 58:38.740
Oop, did I just hang up on someone else?

58:38.740 --> 58:39.740
Okay, let's go.

58:39.740 --> 58:41.940
Phone lines are open.

58:41.940 --> 58:44.500
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

58:44.500 --> 58:45.780
You can always call us on Skype.

58:45.780 --> 58:47.460
Our username is orangeloungeradio.

58:47.460 --> 58:50.980
Does anybody have any last-minute stories real quick?

58:50.980 --> 58:52.820
Interject here in between some calls?

58:52.820 --> 58:56.680
Yeah, just a couple things real quick.

58:56.680 --> 59:03.820
Mega Man Star Force is actually getting a pretty cool peripheral for the DS, and it's

59:03.820 --> 59:12.300
some sort of card scanning system that they had for Animal Crossing and some other stuff

59:12.300 --> 59:18.780
before, so you can actually plug that in and scan your Mega Man cards to be able to play

59:18.780 --> 59:23.060
in the role-playing game as well, so that's kind of neat.

59:23.060 --> 59:31.020
And then Eidos has grabbed the rights for Daffy Duck and The O.C., so we're going to

59:31.020 --> 59:33.020
see some crappy games based on that.

59:33.020 --> 59:34.020
The O.C.?

59:34.020 --> 59:35.020
But The O.C. cancelled.

59:35.020 --> 59:36.020
I don't get it.

59:36.020 --> 59:38.020
All the perfect time to make a game.

59:38.020 --> 59:39.380
We're getting another call real quick.

59:39.380 --> 59:40.380
Let's go to this one.

59:40.380 --> 59:41.500
This is a conference.

59:41.500 --> 59:44.900
I'm a little worried about this one, but I guess we'll pick this up anyway.

59:44.900 --> 59:48.180
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm speaking to two people?

59:48.180 --> 59:50.480
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

59:50.480 --> 59:51.820
My Skype's being glitchy.

59:51.820 --> 59:53.940
Okay, well, what's up, DMN?

59:53.940 --> 59:55.340
What's on your mind?

59:55.340 --> 59:56.340
Not much.

59:56.340 --> 59:57.740
I'm calling to defend WarioWare.

59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.660
Okay, oh yes, because I didn't give it a negative review.

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.820
I said it's fun, but like most Wariowares, I don't see the magic lasting.

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:09.460
Well, like most Wariowares, there you go, Rob.

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.340
It's the same thing.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:15.740
I think everybody in your chat room, everybody who listens to your show, and you including

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:19.560
myself, I knew that this game was going to have a lot of shit, but it was going to be

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.580
three hours long of gameplay.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.900
But it's a great party game.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.280
It is, and I don't disagree with you there.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.020
So what do you want to defend?

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:33.340
Where am I wrong in my assessment of WarioWare?

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.340
Just because you're stupid.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.340
No.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.420
I have to agree with that, too.

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.020
Yeah, I knew it.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.540
I knew there was two people on the line.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.540
Rama, you're there, too?

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:50.860
Never mind the fact that there's two people on the line right now, whatever, but what's

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.860
this whole defending WarioWare thing?

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:56.340
I can't tell you why.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.140
Okay, Rama, you care to chime in on this whole thing?

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:05.060
No, because I haven't played WarioWare yet, but I can say this because of you guys, I

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.820
did buy two new games, Luminous Mobile and Cooking Mama.

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:12.260
Did you hear that, Rama, about Cooking Mama because of us?

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.260
He told me last night.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.260
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:15.260
Luminous Mobile!

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.100
It's the only mobile game I think I've ever talked good about on this program, so it's

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.100
worth it.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.100
It's a good buy.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:25.500
Yeah, I'm paying like $1.99 for it a month, and I'm connected to a server, so top rankings

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.500
and stuff like that.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.340
I'm like, eh, no big deal.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:35.580
But another thing about WarioWare, going back to that, is this shows almost everything that

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:42.540
the Wii can do, even more so than Wii Sports did.

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.540
I could rent it and get a lot of that.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.900
You could.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:53.900
I think it's worth a buy if you have, like me, I always have people over here.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.860
I don't know if you get that from OLR, but this place has become party central, and it's

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.820
starting to look like it, too.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.020
There's people here all the time.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:05.300
Thusly, WarioWare, Mario Party, those games are excellent buys for me.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:09.780
For anybody with a large family or something, I just think for single player people, it's

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.780
going to wear thin.

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:16.420
Yeah, and it's a whole other show to tell you what I've seen strewn about Rob's place.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.860
One thing I do want to agree with you on, I do think the $50 price tag for that game

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.860
is quite steep.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:26.740
I think maybe if it was released at $29.99, maybe $39.99, that's kind of pushing the envelope,

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:33.660
but I don't think $49.99 was a good idea, and I don't agree with Nintendo on that decision.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:36.820
Well, that's what it is.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.860
Now I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do on this program, and I'm going

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.740
to hang up on two people at once.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.620
You suck!

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.620
No!

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:52.740
That was fun.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:56.320
And that would be Pwned, with a capital P, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:57.320
One more call.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.660
It's Legend of Zaku.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:02.900
Well, hi, Legend of Zaku.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.900
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:04.900
Sure would be complete without a call from you.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.900
I know.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:06.900
God damn.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:07.900
We were just wondering when you'd get through.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.980
It's the first one of the year, though.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.920
Well, what's up, Zaku?

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:19.500
You know about the whole weed debacle about the DJs going too far and not sure, basically

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:24.020
fucking up when they shouldn't, when they shouldn't, you know, taking diligence.

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:25.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.740
What's the point?

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.900
I mean, I'm not trying to belittle your call, and your opinion is certainly important, but

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.820
God damn if I haven't talked about this issue until I've been blue in the face.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.620
Remember, Zaku, I live here.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.500
If you think it's water cooler top where you are, it's like ten times as much where I am,

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.700
because like everybody thinks they knew her.

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:44.460
Right there, it's a local, one of the local things that's happening around the back of

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:45.460
the woods.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:52.740
And so, I mean, I could see that they're able to face involuntary manslaughter charges just

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:59.780
for the fact that if you heard the tapes and all the recordings that were actually saved,

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:02.780
you could see on their part that they're just shrugging off people that could have warned

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:06.260
them and they just, they show no regard.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:13.180
They said that they had like, they had them sign a liability, you know, waiver.

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:18.540
You know, I go back to what someone in chat said earlier, it's not just the DJs.

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.620
There were ten people that went into making this contest.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.740
The DJs just egged it on, but that's their job.

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:30.140
Yeah, the people basically, not only the DJs, but the people involved in, you know, organizing

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:36.100
the event, they face, they're going to, they'll face justice eventually.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.900
And I think in a civil trial, the entire station is going to pay for it.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:45.120
I wouldn't doubt, I got to be honest, Naku, I wouldn't doubt if that station doesn't go

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.860
through some radical changes.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.660
I bet you anything that entire, and I'll keep you posted, but I bet you that whole station

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.620
goes down over this.

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:56.100
They change their name or their look or something, they're going to have to distance themselves

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.100
from this somewhere.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:02.180
I mean, when it's showing up on the BBC's website that your little local radio station

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:08.580
threw this contest that resulted in the death of someone, that whole station's in for it.

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.580
Right, think about it.

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.740
And I'll tell you something else, Naku, it sucks.

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:14.740
The station sucks.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.180
I mean, I hardly ever listen to it.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:21.900
It's like Britney Spears and all that kind of crap is what they play on there.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.340
In New York, they call it Z100.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.340
Yeah, Z100 essentially.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:27.340
Yes.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.780
Basically, I mean, when you have that, I mean, remember what happened with Opie and Anthony

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:37.580
when they pulled that stunt a few years ago, they got him kicked off a terrestrial radio

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.580
for the first time?

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.580
Yeah, but having sex in a church isn't going to kill someone.

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:44.580
The station actually went through a lot of format shifts.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.980
It changed formats throughout the years.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:53.620
The time of the incident until now has just went through what, a second format change?

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.220
So yeah, I mean, they tried their best to distance themselves and what I see in the

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.580
future, I hope not, but I mean...

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.580
Make it quick, Zaku.

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.140
They want this topic banned in chat.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.140
Final thought.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:09.300
It might just reformat the station and that's about it.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:13.380
I mean, they will face justice eventually, so, you know, one of these people will end

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.380
up paying.

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.180
Well, we'll keep you here posted on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:20.300
Unless this continues to have nothing to do with gaming, then we probably won't say anything

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.300
at all.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.300
All right.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.300
All right, have a good one, Zaku.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.300
See you later.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.300
See you later.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.300
Bye.

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.620
I don't know how you guys feel about this, but my personal thought is I'm willing to

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.660
talk about this as long as it has to do with gaming.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.040
If Nintendo is brought into the suit, then it has to do with gaming, but if it stays

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.820
the way it is, I don't really want to talk about it anymore.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.820
We've said enough.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:39.820
Nail in the coffin.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:40.820
Thank you.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:41.820
One more call.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:42.820
Oh, damn.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:43.820
It just went away.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:44.820
Let me have a little call back.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.820
Any more last minute?

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.060
Finish up that thought on the last minute story you had real quick.

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.060
Oh, yeah.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:53.940
This is the one that's coming out for the Wii and other game that's being put out that's

01:06:53.940 --> 01:07:02.300
actually going to be kind of like a, what is it, a crazy taxi but with emergency vehicles

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:08.020
called Emergency Mayhem that's being put out by Codemasters, also going to be on the PS2

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:09.020
and the PSP.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.420
That looks kind of fun.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.420
That's it.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:14.420
That's all I got.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.420
All right.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.420
We got our caller again.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:17.420
Let's go to the phone.

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.420
This will be the last one.

01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.420
Hey, Mario.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:20.420
Mario Trejo.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.420
Who's this?

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:22.420
Hey, ShadowNextGen.

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.420
Hi, ShadowNextGen.

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:24.420
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.940
How's it going, guys?

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.260
Pretty good, you know.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.260
It goes.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.260
It goes.

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:33.860
First of all, since I haven't been able to call in for a while, I want to say I really

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.540
enjoyed your appearance on AGI.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:37.540
Thank you.

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.940
We've actually been getting quite a few compliments on that.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:41.940
That's something else.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.640
You know, we like working with Scott and them.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.640
It's fun.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640
Yeah.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:51.180
I thought tomorrow's show should be funny if Scott shows up since his Patriots lost.

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.880
You know, I don't really follow football, but yeah, I do know he was pretty passionate

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.260
about the game tonight, so that should be interesting.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:00.620
But aren't they off all week?

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.780
They have a show tomorrow, I believe, and then they're off.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:04.780
Interesting.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.780
All right.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:09.620
Well, what's on your mind tonight in regards to gaming?

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:14.780
I was curious about – it was actually a comment, I think it was AGI made a while back.

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:18.260
It was either AGI or you guys, because I listened to both of you a lot.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.900
They were worried about with the Wii's price point – this was back in October, September

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.100
– about how since Nintendo was supposed to have all of these different consoles, how

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:31.380
you would be able to walk into a store and find anyone with no problem, and therefore

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.980
they thought there would be a problem because people would see it as, you know, since it's

01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:38.380
already there, you know, it wasn't really that good or it wasn't that hot of an item

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.380
type of thing.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:44.120
I can't remember if we said that or – I don't think that we would have said that,

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.900
because my kind of viewpoint on it is that I think, you know, a little bit of demand

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.340
is a good thing, but this is too much.

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.340
This is too much.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.340
This is exactly what Microsoft went through, you know?

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.340
Yeah.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.340
Yeah.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.780
Well, no, I was just kind of curious about what your thoughts were as how people were

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:03.180
predicting now what happens, and now the exact opposite has happened where you cannot find

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:07.700
a Wii anywhere, but you can almost walk into any store and find a PS3.

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.700
Yeah.

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:12.340
You know, but I wonder how much – I don't have any sales stats, I don't know, but

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.140
how much of this is Nintendo making?

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:16.660
I mean, how has production been at the Wiis?

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.660
Been pretty low.

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.060
Yeah, because what I understand is that we all have this impression that the Wiis are

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.620
just rolling off the freaking assembly line, but I believe I heard somewhere else that

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.980
the actual amount of shipments that these places are getting are not weekly.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.180
No, they're not weekly, and I want to say the last shipment we got was in December.

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:36.180
The next one we're getting is this week, and that's how long it's been.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.100
It's been a few weeks since we've gotten anything, and it's because they're sold

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.100
out.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:45.860
They're sold out of DS, they're sold out of Zelda, the GameCube Zelda.

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:47.860
They're just way behind in everything.

01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:49.460
They're too damn popular.

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.980
And the thing with the PS3 being in stock is not because they're shipping a ton of

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.540
units, it's because they're not selling as many units as they're shipping.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:59.660
They're just getting, you know, shipments every now and then, but they're just not

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.660
selling them.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:04.140
It's not the hot item they thought it would be, or at least not yet.

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:08.020
Well, the system's not going to sell very well if there's only 13 games out for it,

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.540
so that's a problem.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:15.020
Out of curiosity, are you a Wii or PlayStation 3 owner yourself?

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.340
A Wii and a 360.

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:18.260
Ah, so you're a Wii 60 camp.

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.900
Any interest in PS3?

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.620
Excuse me?

01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.740
Any interest in PS3?

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.260
Maybe down the line.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:31.580
It will depend on how many more exclusively Sony.

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.140
You sound just like me.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:39.900
All I need to hear is basically a Final Fantasy or a Kingdom Hearts on the 360, and I might

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.100
be done with Sony.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.620
Yeah, I know.

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:48.700
If Square came out tomorrow and announced Kingdom Hearts 3 for the 360, put a fork in

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.500
Sony as far as I'm concerned.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.500
But I don't know.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:56.180
Again, I say that kind of jokingly on here, but I don't know.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:02.060
Let's not forget that Katamari Damacy was a very excellent, albeit third-party, exclusive

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.060
game.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.060
I guess all these games are third-party exclusives.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.060
They went over to Sony.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:10.140
It was just an awesome game, and PS2 took a little while to build up some steam.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.540
I didn't buy a PS2 on launch day.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:13.540
I didn't buy one for a while.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:16.060
I don't think I bought one until Final Fantasy X came out.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.460
I didn't get one until the Slim Units came out was when I got my PS2.

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.460
Oh, you know what?

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.660
I had an import one for the longest time.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.660
That's what it was.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:26.900
Well, anyhow, anything else you want to share with tonight's program?

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.860
Yeah, I had another question for you guys.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:33.220
I know it's probably a little late, but I was wondering if there was any particular

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:40.700
game or series in 2006 that you guys wanted to play but didn't get to?

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:46.300
Any particular series or game in 2006 that we wanted to play but didn't get to?

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.860
That you didn't have the time to get to or whatnot?

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:54.460
Maybe something you were looking forward to but you just didn't get to it for whatever

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.740
reason?

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:58.780
How about games that I didn't spend enough time with that I wanted to spend more time

01:11:58.780 --> 01:11:59.780
with?

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:00.780
Trauma Center.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.560
Yeah, well, I actually did play a lot of Trauma Center.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.800
The Final Fantasy games, like I played 12 enough to know that I put in a pretty good

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:10.800
chunk of hours.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:15.140
I went after the double digits and hours, but I wish I could spend more time with that

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.380
and I needed to play Final Fantasy III enough.

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:21.400
I never did get Cooking Mama and Jamie won't shut up about it, so I know I needed to check

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.740
that one out.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.380
I'm trying to think what other franchises.

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.500
Not a lot coming to mind.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.180
I have played most of the stuff I wanted to play.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:35.780
Probably PC gaming and I think a lot of the stuff on PC.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.860
You know Sam and Max, those original games?

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.780
I heard a lot of good stuff about them and even a GameTap subscriber just haven't had

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:42.780
the time to check those out.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:45.500
I've heard a lot of good things about them, so that's on my to-do list.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.860
So I guess that's my answer, Sam and Max.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.340
Have any of you guys tried out the Shadow Hearts RPG series?

01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:57.060
I've heard of it and I've heard really good things about it and I have a friend who's

01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.280
playing it, but I haven't played it myself.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.300
Is that something you think ought to be on my list?

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.540
Yeah, they're excellent games.

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.620
They have three of them out now.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.700
I don't know how well they sell.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:11.260
They sell well enough to where the sequels have been coming out, but I think it's one

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.980
of them that flies under a lot of people's radar for whatever reason.

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:15.980
Are those on GameCube?

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.980
PS2.

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:17.980
A PS2?

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.180
I am thinking of something else.

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.180
I've heard of it.

01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.180
I've heard of it, too.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.180
I haven't really played it.

01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:24.180
I still wanted to play it, Connie.

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.180
Yeah, you guys should try to have enough time if you can.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:30.300
Like I said, there are three games and they are a lot of fun, especially if you do RPGs.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:31.640
They're kind of a little off the wall.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:37.460
They have somewhat of a historical perspective, but then a lot of it is they spun history,

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.740
so there's fiction in it, too.

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:41.740
Send some info to my email.

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:42.740
I'll check it out.

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.500
I'll at least rent it if nothing else.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.500
Yeah, okay.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:50.020
And then once fixed on it, then I'll clear the line for you guys.

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.020
Yup.

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:55.620
Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play pre-orders being sold out with GameStop and EB?

01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.020
Loki, have you heard about the Wii Play bundles being sold out with GameStop and EB?

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.020
Yup.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.380
What do you think of that?

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.380
What do I think of that?

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.220
Do you know anybody else who's doing pre-orders for that?

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:11.220
Yeah, I know a lot of local mom and pop stores are doing pre-orders because I know we got

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:18.860
our allocations, and we got quite a bit of units allocated to us, so I'm surprised that

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:21.540
they're sold out already.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:24.700
I'm hearing Wii Play's not worth it unless you need the controller.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.140
That's what it is.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:30.300
Everyone's getting in for the controller, and it's basically almost like a free game

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.300
with it.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.300
Alright, well...

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:33.300
But it's $50, right?

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.300
Isn't it $49.99?

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.300
No, that's right.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.300
I thought it was $39.99.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.300
Is it $39?

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.300
No, that's $40.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.300
I'm wrong.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.300
$49.99.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:46.060
Alright, well, thanks for taking my call, guys, and I'm a big fan as always.

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.060
No problem.

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.460
We appreciate the call and the game recommendation.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.460
Have a good one, buddy.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.460
Yeah, talk to you later.

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.460
Later.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.460
Yup.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:54.620
You know, like I said, we have day jobs and all that stuff.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.260
We can't always get around to playing everything, but we try.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.700
Between the three of us, we play an awful lot.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:05.220
I like to play a lot of types of role-playing games, although somehow I missed that one.

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:10.580
Loki likes to play the shoot-and-kill-the-hooker type games, and Jamie likes to play really

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.660
weird shit.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.500
I don't play weird shit.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.820
No, you like to play Kingdom Hearts, that's what you like to play.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:17.820
Yes, I do.

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:23.820
I was going to say, there's a funny website I read about today, I forgot to mention.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:26.500
TheBigBoxProject.com.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:37.300
It's about this guy who sent back a console, an Xbox 360 console, to Microsoft originally,

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:43.420
and the problem is they sent it back and it's still busted, so now between the time he sent

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:46.500
the first one in and the second one needs to go back, they've changed their policy and

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:51.940
they want him to pay to have it fixed or whatever, so he's like, okay, fine, if that's the case,

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.580
I'm going to send this in the biggest fucking box I can find.

01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:04.660
So he's trying to pay to get one of those rail car crates, the big giant rail cars to

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:11.700
deliver this thing in, and it's funny because on the website if you go to it, it has a little

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.060
dialogue on here, it says, how big is your repair center?

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:19.660
And then their technician's like, I don't see how that pertains to the situation, sir,

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:25.380
because I'm going to send you my broken Xbox in the biggest damn box you've ever seen.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.380
Will it be filled with little styrofoam pellets?

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.940
That's what I want to know.

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.460
I can only hope.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:40.860
Can you imagine, somebody pokes a little hole in the box and suddenly they're under a mountain

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.980
of styrofoam pellets.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.460
Can you wrap the Xbox in that much bubble wrap?

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.500
It should be wrapped in duct tape, solid duct tape.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:57.060
That would be a better use of your money right there, is to take the box and wrap the whole

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:05.420
box in two feet of duct tape, two feet thick, and that would be awesome to send.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:08.380
Sounds like a Daffy Duck cartoon, sorry, I'm just imagining the opening.

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:11.580
You wouldn't even be able to cut through it, you'd have to saw through it to get to the

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.580
Xbox.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:13.580
Wow.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:17.460
Of course, if I were just them, I'd just be like, return to sender, bitch.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:26.780
Any last minute stories from you, Dark Sakura?

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:27.780
Not I.

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.780
No?

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.780
How's it going?

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:30.780
You've been kind of quiet tonight.

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:31.780
You okay?

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:32.780
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.780
Just making sure.

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.780
Need a hug?

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.780
No, I need food.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:36.780
Eat some coffee.

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:37.780
Well, food, sounds good.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:38.780
No coffee, I have to sleep eventually.

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.820
Well, to get to the food, we have to get to our final thoughts, because we've got to wrap

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:43.380
this thing up.

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.940
Thank you guys so much for listening to us.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:48.700
Let's go around and get the final thoughts, Loki.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:53.020
My final thought is, I need to play more Resistance.

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.420
My final thought is, I'm getting my PlayStation 2 back from my friend, because I have this

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.980
urge to play Kingdom Hearts ever since I got back from Disneyland.

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.700
Damn Disneyland, damn it.

01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:06.380
Also, do you know I subscribed to video podcasts this week that talk about Disneyland?

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:08.900
And yeah, that's pretty sad.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:10.220
I'm turning into Jamie.

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:16.500
Jamie, your final thought, you need some gas X?

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.500
No.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.900
You don't have anything else to say?

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:23.140
You don't have a certain phrase you say every week on the show?

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.140
Kiss my ass.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:31.020
You're not going to say to reject?

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.020
Kiss my ass.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.020
All right, fine.

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.020
I'm just checking.

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.820
Want to make sure that's the official final thought.

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.820
All right, bend over.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:43.260
Thank you so much, everybody, for tuning into and downloading our podcast and supporting

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.900
independent internet radio.

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:46.540
You guys are awesome for doing so.

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:51.340
If you would be so kind to leave us a kind review on iTunes or dig our program over on

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:56.020
dig.com or just tell a friend is really the best thing you could do, because if you tell

01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.620
a friend about our program, then that's how we stay in business, because we don't have

01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:04.060
those marketing dollars behind us, because we're po like you.

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:07.400
Well, if you aren't poor, then send us money.

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:30.420
On that note, have a great night, and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
