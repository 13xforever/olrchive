00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Music

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, January 7th, 2007, Xbox 360 upgrade rumors abound,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Nintendo partners with an MMO developer, and prepare to waste even more time with Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Music

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Welcome back, live listeners, to a new year of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We are that radio program on the interweb dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You will be like us, of greatest compulsory.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
One of us, one of us.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How are you, my dear?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Upgraded.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Upgraded.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I heard because you made me play DDR, you bitch.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
DDR was fun today.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It was fun.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Good times.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was fun.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Say hello as well to recently upgraded tech master, Loki.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hello.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now with more anger and angst.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's great.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sure.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, all right.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now how you doing?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You going to Macworld?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh yeah, totally.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm there.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All right.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Welcome, by the way, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I know we got some new listeners while we were off on holiday for a little while.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thanks as well to all the sites that joined us last week for the New Year's Eve special.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And then they turned around and pimped us out on their respective sites.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We really appreciate you guys doing that.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I know we got some new listeners from that.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So just to kind of set the stage, since it is a new year, let's do the whole spiel about what we're all about.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Again, since it is new year, 2007.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So Orange Lounge Radio, we formed in the year 2002.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And we actually all met playing DDR.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Go figure.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But you know, you remember when arcades were actually kind of cool and like a lot of people went there.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And you know, it wasn't just about the little ticket spitting games and the place was riddled with children.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When arcades were cool, Dark Soccer, myself and Loki all met up.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And we just decided, you know, because Dark Soccer and I had kind of known each other a little bit before that.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We were doing another radio program under station live.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And we thought, hey, let's do a show about video games.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay. And then, you know, Loki joined us for that.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And here we are almost five years later, still doing it.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So the show started about music video games.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So sometimes you hear Orange Lounge Radio, the Bobani radio station, which, you know, we still love our music based games.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But we like to think that we are gaming fans first.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We just love video games in general.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So that's what the show is all about now.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So the show we try to present to you guys here every week is that we go over the news.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And yeah, you know, we only do a show once a week.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We only do a show once a week.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So you're not always going to get the latest and greatest here.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We do have the fortunate luck of having Loki working in the industry in an area that most media doesn't think to look in, which is distribution.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So sometimes we get some pretty good exclusives that way.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But otherwise, you know, we're kind of like we imagine one thing we used to do when we were at the arcades is that, you know, remember when we did like the Wednesday night, we'd get together, play DDR.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And then what do we do afterwards?

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We went to Brookfield's and just, you know, talk.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Pinned out?

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah, well, we ate a lot and then we nerded out talking about stuff.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So that's kind of what we are.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We're the folks sitting around the dinner table at, you know, your local diner talking about games and talking smack when appropriate and talking about good things.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And we like to invite guests to our table once in a while from the gaming industry, hoping to have some good names on in 2007.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And we like to invite all of you.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We like to fill up the restaurant with our listeners.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We know that the majority of our listeners catch us on the audio blog, also known as podcast, which is released every Monday and Wednesday.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But we also have our live listeners.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on Orange Lounge Radio, orangeloungeradio.com.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We have a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week station.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We're not the only show on it.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In fact, every weeknight but Monday, you can hear some type of nerd program on the station.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Tuesday nights, at least for right now, just the first Tuesday of every month.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But we're hoping to have something to fill in the gaps in the interim.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We have pump up the volume and then something unannounced that will be filling in the gaps on Tuesday in the interim.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then Wednesday nights, we have Guys on a Show, which is kind of like pop culture, geek culture stuff.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thursday nights, STFU, which is really fast-paced game talk.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's more like a sports show.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Friday nights, we have Club OLR, which is just strictly music.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And by the way, if you missed this week's Club OLR, you did a fantastic job mixing music this week, Loki.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm not just saying that.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It was awesome.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I loved it.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought it was great.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Would you do a rip-off of something else?

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, no.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I didn't rip anything off.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I thought you did a great job.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Maybe you hurried through it or something.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A little bit of trivia for those folks out there.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Live Wire from the first episode was actually the second episode I did.

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And then I flipped them.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I see.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Because I liked one of them better than the other one.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, I liked it.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That was good.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, Saturday nights, Travis Donovan Live, geek sci-fi gaming 360.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know, whatever's on his mind, trying to bring a little dose of reality to you kids.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And of course, Sunday nights, we're here.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right, enough plugs for the side projects.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We want to welcome all of our new and old listeners.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Those have been with us for so many years.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And those that are just joining us, new this week.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We had some noobs in chat tonight.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, we want to say hi to the noobs.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think I saw NZ Gamer said he was a noob.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hi, noob.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And somebody else said they were a noob, too.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We had PH Alfan was a noob.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hi, noob.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Welcome.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, and okay, let's get into how we like to start off every show.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A little bit of how was your gaming week?

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What have you been playing?

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You made me play DDR.

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I did.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It was fun.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, it was.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I played also some BeatMania 3, was it the sixth, I think?

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, sixth mix.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Played some Cooking Mama.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Played some Pinball.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We got our Who Done It back, which is now Trading Potter.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And I joined Guild Wars this week.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't really care for it the last time I tried it, but I gave it a go this time around.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It was more fun.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't know if I'm going to stick with it, but I figure at the very least, if I pay the

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
money for it, I can just play it whenever I want and don't have to worry about anything,

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
so I'm thinking about it.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I've been playing with my friend Heather.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's pretty cool.

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
More Cooking Mama, huh?

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Have you beat Cooking Mama yet?

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I came this close to buying Cooking Mama, but I'm holding out for the Wii version.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, I'm both.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, but the thing was-

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Completion!

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think Trauma Center was that much better on the Wii because I kind of just didn't get

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
around to playing the DS version.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It was so awesome when I played it on the Wii, so I'm kind of holding off for my Mama

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
until the Wii version.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't worry.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll be showing Mama some love.

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't worry.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And to make a rebuttal to Holy Shonen, I think you're wrong.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What did Holy Shonen say?

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
World of Warcraft is better than Guild Wars.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
World of Warcraft is just more annoying than Guild Wars.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You know, it just kind of depends.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They're almost exactly the same game.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't see what the point is.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't care.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You don't-

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm going to be playing them both.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I understand because Guild Wars, you kind of level up to 20 and pretty much the entire

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
game is end game, but World of Warcraft has a little more in the interim because you know

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you're going all the way to 60.

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There's a lot more to do in the interim.

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I guess if you're addicted to leveling, that's fine, but I think that Guild Wars takes a

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
little bit more skill to play.

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know.

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know.

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They're just very similar in game structure to me.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know.

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't really prefer one to the other.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I like the fact that Guild Wars I can go to whenever I want for free, like once I've bought

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
it, but you know that the game still has not dropped in price.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you want to get the old school Guild Wars, you have to pay the full 50 bucks for it,

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
which is interesting.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, but keep in mind, say you're paying, what is it, $9.99 a month for-

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wow?

179
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
For World of Warcraft, right?

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Isn't it like $12 or $14.95?

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't even remember.

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, it's more like $12, but just-

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think Final Fantasy is $12.95 and WoW is like $14.

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't remember.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Something like that.

186
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Anyway, you're going to end up paying more in a year for World of Warcraft than you are

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
going to pay for Guild Wars.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I did feel like the WoW universe was way more expansive, though.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There was a lot more to see in WoW.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But the fundamental difference between the two, here's the fundamental difference between

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
the two.

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In Guild Wars, the entire game is what you would call an instance in WoW.

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's alluring to some people, the fact that they play with exactly who they want

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and that's it.

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know what I mean?

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's like when you go out into the world, it's your world with your friends, and that's

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
either the upside to Guild Wars or it's the downside.

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you like to meet new people, then Guild Wars may not be the better name.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, that's why you have their talent.

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So you meet people there.

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, anyway, before we get into further argument, you know what?

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Just play Final Fantasy XI.

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then you just wait all day for a party and never get anything done.

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, and I have to also tell GS68 that Ghost Squad is freaking fun as hell.

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What are you talking about?

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What?

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
GS68.

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I was talking about Ghost Squad.

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's a gun game in the arcades.

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That game is freaking hot.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I love that game.

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I haven't played a good gun game in a while.

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I haven't played it in ages, but Dan and I went and we just freaking played through

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
every mission and it was great.

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Every time I want to play Time Crisis 4, somebody's on it.

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh well.

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It was pretty good.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Full of lots of stuff.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I got a PlayStation 3, and so I played lots of Resistance, and that game is far better

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
than Gears of War.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I love that game.

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's very pretty.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Looking at Resistance makes you question, hey, maybe the PlayStation 3 actually does

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
look better than the 360, and it really looks good.

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
In fact, I found myself literally, between gunfights, standing there going, wow, this

227
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
looks really good.

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What a fucking change for the year 2007 on this program.

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You are gushing about Sony tonight.

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What the hell?

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, no, no.

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hold on, hold on.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is he drinking?

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Resistance is good, okay?

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now...

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Didn't I tell you?

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That game is hot.

238
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's awesome.

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's it.

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But here's the problem, though.

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That is it.

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Unfortunately, that's all that's out there.

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I mean...

244
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Whoa, back up.

245
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You got a PS3?

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, I got a PS3.

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So I'm the only OLR host without a PS3?

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, I got mine.

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I got hooked up, okay, for the PlayStation 3.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hey, hey.

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm the only one without the cool new toys.

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, I know.

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey, Ron.

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

255
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hi.

256
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're just not part of the PS Wii 60 club, so whatever.

257
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I heart my Wii 60.

258
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Screw you.

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Anyway, so, no, seriously, though.

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's fun.

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It really is fun, and I like it so much better than Gears of War.

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And the fact there's so many different difficulties you can play it on, so if you really aren't

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
all hardcore into it and stuff, you can have a good time with it.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So it's very good.

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I like it.

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Um, Ridge Racer 7.

267
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, I bought Ridge Racer 7 because Nelly actually wanted to play it.

268
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You know, and to be honest, I've played it, and it's exactly the same as Ridge Racer 6.

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,500
It pretty much is.

270
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, now, you said earlier, though, that you felt Resistance was better than anything

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you'd see on the 360.

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,500
So, because Ridge Racer 7 and 6 are so similar, did you think that, graphically, the PlayStation

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
3 one was superior?

274
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
No.

275
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Because I remember a while back, no.

276
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,000
Both were comparing the two and saying the 360 version looked better.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I shouldn't say the 360 version, but you know what I mean.

278
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Honestly, I couldn't pick up the differences.

279
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,500
The only difference I saw was when you hit your Nitro, instead of the screen kind of

280
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
turning white on the edges, it did this weird blur thing.

281
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,000
But that's about it.

282
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,500
So, I do like Ridge Racer 7 and how they have different ways you can customize your cars

283
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
and stuff.

284
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
That's kind of cool.

285
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
So, yeah.

286
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Full Auto 2 was another one I picked up on that as well.

287
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I mean, I was a huge fan of Full Auto 1.

288
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Which is sold back this week.

289
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
And, Full Auto 2 is, it's okay.

290
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
It's just like the first game.

291
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I didn't really notice any differences.

292
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean, the graphics look a little different, but it's pretty much the first game all over

293
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
again.

294
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So, that's kind of cool.

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,500
Let's do some chat room comments, because the chat room is on fire tonight.

296
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,060
We've got a lot of new people in chat, and I think they've got three weeks of comments

297
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,260
just penting up here.

298
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,140
Mike W. says, Rob was also the only OLR host without a 360 for a while.

299
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
That's true.

300
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
I didn't get a 360 until March.

301
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
To be honest, though.

302
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,220
You eBayed it, or Craigslisted it or something and paid way too much for one, and she got

303
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,780
the hookup because Dan was looking at it.

304
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,380
To be honest, though, I wouldn't have bought a PS3 if I hadn't, you know.

305
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
Yeah, you got a hookup.

306
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,380
I know.

307
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,380
You got a...

308
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,380
Do you have to put out for that?

309
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,380
No.

310
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Oh, that's good.

311
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
Let's see.

312
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
What else do we have here?

313
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,380
We have...

314
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,620
Jeremy Todd 1 says, Loki, I don't care what you say.

315
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
Nellie is a gamer now.

316
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,380
Nellie, of course, being Loki's wife.

317
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
She's now reading.

318
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,140
She's reading a new Harry Potter.

319
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,340
Rama says, hey Rob, you're not missing anything with the Doorstop 3.

320
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,060
You know, there really isn't anything...

321
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
I actually...

322
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,300
What I would want most out of it right now is the Blu-ray player, and fucking Tekken

323
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Dark Resurrection.

324
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,300
That looks pretty badass.

325
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,420
I haven't downloaded that, because it's in another country, and I don't like fighting

326
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,100
games that much, so it's not a big deal for me.

327
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,140
But I tried Grip Shift, and that blows ass, and I would not recommend it at all.

328
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,580
Motorstorm is fucking awesome.

329
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,580
I love the demo for Motorstorm.

330
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,980
I did not like Motorstorm at all.

331
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,980
Oh, I love Motorstorm.

332
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,860
You didn't think it was slow?

333
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
I thought it was slow.

334
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
No, it's good.

335
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
It's good.

336
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
I like it.

337
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,860
Is it just maybe the target?

338
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I don't know.

339
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,580
Jaden says, next week, Loki takes back everything he said about Max, because he received a Mac

340
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,540
and gloats about it.

341
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,260
Could this be the year of change for Loki?

342
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,980
No, listen, if I got a free Mac, I would be selling that shit back.

343
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,620
I'd actually probably smash it with a hammer, or give it to Nellie.

344
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
She'd probably want it.

345
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,260
But no, other than...

346
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,020
Mac fans, don't turn us off, because I heart Max, and so does Jamie.

347
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
He's just crazy.

348
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
I just don't like them.

349
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,700
I'm sure we're building a PC.

350
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,540
And I don't know if anyone's seen the new pictures of the new VAIO, but my god, Sony's

351
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,380
copying Apple now.

352
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
That's pretty bad.

353
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,840
Anyways, so back in the games, real quick.

354
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
So yeah, I played that Gran Turismo HD.

355
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,500
It actually looks better than the one at E3, but not by much.

356
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,100
So thank god it's free, because I sure as hell wouldn't buy that piece of shit.

357
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,620
I don't like Gran Turismo, so that's just me.

358
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,320
It looks pretty, I guess, but I don't know.

359
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,780
It seems to me, and this is what I've noticed with a lot of the games on there, seems to

360
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,260
be a lot of these racing games, because that's mainly what I've been playing, have the kind

361
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,700
of okay foreground stuff, and they have this really high-res background image that's kind

362
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,980
of plastered on there.

363
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,340
I don't know if you've noticed that in some of the pictures of Gran Turismo HD and Motor

364
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Storm and stuff.

365
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,740
It's kind of simple than this big high-res thing that looks really pretty, and people

366
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,740
are thinking that it's rendered, but it's not.

367
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,060
Is that it for your gaming week?

368
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,900
Call of Duty 3 multiplayer on the 360 was awesome.

369
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,000
I love that game, but I think I'm going to play Resistance instead, and of course, Grand

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Theft Auto Vices.

371
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Have you played Resistance online?

372
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,420
I haven't played it online yet.

373
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,940
I'm looking forward to doing that, but I've been too busy playing the story mode in it,

374
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,580
and I love the story mode.

375
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,620
Even with no achievements to unlock, this is amazing to me.

376
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,840
The thing that's kind of cool about those, they sort of have an achievement system for

377
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
that one game.

378
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,040
You unlock these skill points, they call them, and it actually unlocks different things like

379
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,380
costumes and stuff.

380
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,260
So like in Excite Truck and Burnout, you get trophies.

381
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,660
Yeah, something like that, but what's kind of neat though is when you play through the

382
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,540
whole game, it unlocks more weapons, and you can go back and play through again, and then

383
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,900
you can unlock harder difficulties and stuff, and you get more skins for multiplayer.

384
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,740
But I do want to try out 40 player multiplayer online with that.

385
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,740
I think that'd be crazy.

386
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,100
Alright, is that it for your gaming week?

387
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
That is it.

388
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,580
Oh, and by the way, just real quick, real quick, Playstation 3, their download thing,

389
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,740
okay, fucking sucks, balls, okay?

390
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,680
The fact that it takes like an hour to download something, and you can't do anything while

391
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,300
it's downloading, that fucking sucks, and they need to fix that, okay, now I'm done.

392
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,460
Quick comment on the Playstation 3 from Jared Joe in chat, I love the potential of my PS3

393
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,940
so far, I can't wait for it to unleash itself, I have Resistance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance,

394
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,520
and both of those games are fantastic.

395
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,540
I had Genji, notice I said I had Genji, so, couldn't stand the enemy crabs, I'm sure.

396
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,660
I have the demo, but I haven't played it yet.

397
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,540
Alright, my gaming week, okay, when I sat down a couple weeks ago to think about my

398
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,360
top ten games of 2006, I came to the realization that Oblivion really was probably, I think,

399
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,180
the second best game of 2006, I did name Zelda Twilight Princess number one, but I really

400
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,260
thought Oblivion was number two, but then I realized, like, I hadn't really fully immersed

401
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,540
myself into Oblivion, I'm not sure why, like I played it, and I kind of did the whole sandbox

402
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,500
thing, but I just kind of always fucked around in that game, I never really sat down and

403
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,820
played the story, oh my god, I have wasted so much time on Oblivion this week, it's not

404
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,780
even funny, like, I allowed myself to totally get immersed in it, and just, oh my heck,

405
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,920
I think I'm like six months late from everybody else, but I can't stop playing it, it's crazy.

406
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,260
I haven't sold mine back yet, but that's because I like going in every now and then, punching

407
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,460
animals, that's just me.

408
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,300
It's fun to just sign on once in a while, and I say sign on because the game to me,

409
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,980
it really feels like an MMO, just with the people acting like real people, it's crazy,

410
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,500
it's so weird, it would be really interesting if Bethesda made an Elder Scrolls MMO, that

411
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,540
would be craziness, I don't know, it would be very interesting.

412
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,140
Anyway, so Oblivion, hours and hours sucked into that game this week, because I'm just

413
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,500
a late bloomer in that regard, but I played Halo 2 of all things, some of my college buddies,

414
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,760
way back in the day, like when we were all at college, I was off at Chico and they were

415
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,560
at Sonoma State, we used to sign online and play Quake over the modem every week, once

416
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,140
a week we played Quake, and we decided to try and bring that back a little bit and be

417
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,180
in touch, because now we live all over, my buddy Garret is in town, but Bill's off in

418
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,540
New York City, and Matt's all traveling around the world, so we kind of tried to connect

419
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,900
through Xbox Live, so we played Halo this week.

420
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,300
But what's really funny, well Halo 2, we were playing Halo 2 online, we all suck at it,

421
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,780
but that's the fun part of it, when you're playing against other people who suck at Halo,

422
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
it's pretty fun.

423
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,700
But what's really funny about what happened during it is that we left it on so that anybody

424
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,660
from our friends list could join the game, and somebody that joined the game was gamer

425
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:28,980
Andy, because he has his site, gamerandy.com, and he was signing on to say, I'm sorry, because

426
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,900
he got an invite to the New Year's show, but just scheduling conflicts, he wasn't able

427
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,620
to make it on, so he was coming on to say, sorry, I couldn't make it, we'll have to make

428
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,340
up, and we'll definitely have him on the show some other time, because he's a really cool

429
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,620
guy, but oh my god, he kicked all our asses horribly at Halo, he's like, oh, I'm not any

430
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,900
good, he's very humble, he's like, I haven't played in a year and a half, I suck at Halo,

431
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,500
and he just wiped all of us.

432
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,300
My friend Matt's pretty good, so he was giving him some competition, but we, oh god.

433
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,540
I really need to buy Halo 2, because, you know, I have, I think it was fun when I played,

434
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,660
you know, briefly, a long time ago, but I really, I'm not that great at first person

435
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,180
shooters sometimes, I mean, when we're playing Call of Duty 3, all we played out is rocket

436
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,580
launchers, sniper rifles.

437
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,100
Yeah, that's actually what we were playing was the rockets, and that game was kind of

438
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,940
fun, because that's easy to kill someone in rockets, so.

439
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,940
Yeah, but, yeah, just rockets and just sniper rifles.

440
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,740
Can we form a clan for, like, I suck at Halo, I mean, I realize we have the OL Army, but

441
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,580
I, there's actually good players in the OL Army, we have some people that are, like,

442
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,660
level 21, can we get, like, level 1 for life, Joe?

443
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:36,060
Dude, I suck completely, I suck ass at Halo, so.

444
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,660
When Halo 3 comes out, I'm scared, I'm seriously scared.

445
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,420
We'll just play, because I'll buy Halo 3.

446
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
Okay, there you go.

447
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,060
I'm getting a legendary edition, so I have a helmet at my desk, but that's about it.

448
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,060
And then otherwise, I haven't been playing a lot, I mean, the arcade, of course, DDR

449
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,580
and stuff, but otherwise, I got, oh, I got 200 of 200 achievement points in New Rally

450
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,380
X, thank you very much.

451
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,940
Which is sadly the first arcade game I've gotten all the achievement points on, and

452
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,660
I'm the only one on my friends list that has played the damn game, and I know that because

453
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm the only one with a high score on the list, and I have, like, 70-something friends

454
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,980
on Xbox Live and not a damn other person's played the game except me.

455
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:17,500
But you know what, the only reason I bought it, I remember from my childhood, okay, so

456
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
don't hate.

457
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,980
I remember Rally X in the good old days.

458
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
Now that you're an old man.

459
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
I know.

460
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,740
All right, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight real quick, since we're done with

461
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,140
our gaming week.

462
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,140
DMN over from STFU, our Thursday night program on Orange Launch Radio, wanted me to mention,

463
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,140
they're going to have the dude from VG Cats on this week.

464
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Lucky bastard.

465
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
How are they?

466
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,740
Their show's like five weeks old, and they're already landing these people.

467
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,540
We've been around for five fucking years, and people are like, who are you?

468
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,620
Why should I come on your program?

469
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,100
What's Orange Lounge have to do with video games?

470
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,140
So I say STFU to all of you.

471
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,020
Don't forget all our other live programming on Orange Lounge Radio again, and of course

472
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,220
we wanted to say, take a moment to thank, again, all of our New Year's Eve people we

473
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,820
had on this week.

474
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,300
We hope to incorporate guests, not just from the gaming industry, but other gaming podcasts

475
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,180
and people you see out there in the gaming media.

476
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,100
We're trying to think of ways to incorporate that on into 2007, because the New Year's

477
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,360
episodes seem to be really well received, and you guys seem to dig that, so definitely

478
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,580
we'll do stuff more like that in the future.

479
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,580
It was cool.

480
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,580
Good times.

481
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,580
All right, how about some gaming news?

482
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,140
Let's talk some smack about some gaming news.

483
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,980
Loki, start us off.

484
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,460
Well, apparently there's a small little convention going on called CES, Consumer Electronics

485
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,740
Show, that I completely forgot about, and I was like, oh yeah, CES is going on.

486
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,620
Anyways, so I'm kind of, you know, starting that all off, there's been some rumors coming

487
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:52,860
out about a brand new version of the Xbox 360, now with HDMI, codenamed the Zephyr,

488
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,740
and apparently there's been shots floating around from Engadget.

489
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:03,900
I know there was some video on there from Xbox scene, so definitely something that's

490
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:08,380
probably going to be out there at some point, although a lot of people are bitching, saying,

491
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,220
oh, what about the early adopters?

492
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,100
You screwed all them, but you know, I'm just like, I don't need HDMI.

493
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Whatever.

494
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
My TV doesn't have HDMI.

495
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,620
What, Nintendo does this shit all the time?

496
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,620
No one seems to mind.

497
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Yeah, exactly.

498
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,580
I mean, seriously, I mean, you know, with the DS Lite, I mean, sure, my panties were

499
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,380
ruffled a little bit at the fact that, you know, the DS Lite comes out not even like

500
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,380
a year after the DS is already on shelves and I bought the first printing of the DS,

501
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
but what can you do?

502
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,780
I mean, this thing is inevitable.

503
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,180
Yeah, really, I mean, for me, it's not a big deal.

504
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,300
I mean, I guess later on down the line, if I really had an issue with this, I can just,

505
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,180
I guess, buy another one or something, but I don't know, my TV doesn't have HDMI, so

506
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
it's no good for me.

507
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:56,500
I think my TV does, but, you know, I go back and I think about how long I was like, I have

508
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,980
to get a component cable for the Wii, I have to get a component cable, I have to have like

509
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,980
the best video ever, and then it really wasn't that big a difference.

510
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,980
So I think like, is it really going to be a deal breaker that I can't, I don't get HDMI

511
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
right away?

512
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,260
I mean, chances are my 360 will break eventually anyway and I have to get a new one, so I'll

513
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,820
just wait for that inevitability.

514
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,260
Exactly, and a lot of people are saying also that the new 360 is going to, and I don't

515
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,180
even know where they're pulling this info from, I mean, because I believe the HDMI part

516
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,580
because we've seen pictures of it, but they're saying, oh, it's going to have a 120 gig hard

517
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:36,940
drive and all this stuff, and the, you know, it's going to have the, you know, 65 nanometer

518
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,380
chip sets in there and stuff.

519
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,420
You know, really, the 120 gig hard drive will be something that they add on later.

520
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,860
I mean, that's something that they'll have, you know, the offer that you can buy.

521
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,500
It's not going to be probably included with this.

522
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,060
I mean, I don't know.

523
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,180
To be honest, all I think they're going to do is add this HDMI port.

524
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,260
It's not going to be a brand new model of the 360, it's just going to be, now the 360s

525
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,020
are coming out with HDMI ports on them.

526
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,260
That is it.

527
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,420
And they'll have the, you know, cooler processor in there, so, you know, lower the cost of

528
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:15,180
the system, but I don't think they're going to do anything above and beyond this.

529
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,980
The O, they could prove me wrong because I know there is one thing actually that's coming

530
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:26,140
out of CS that they're talking about using the 360 as an ITV box, so that's going to

531
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,300
be some stuff that's going to come out this week.

532
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:34,380
Or they're talking about to be able to use it to watch web TV, so that's interesting.

533
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,700
But I don't know, it's just, I don't think they're really going to try to do anything

534
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
different.

535
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,740
And also the other rumor was HD DVD drive built in, which I don't, that's not going

536
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
to happen.

537
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,660
I don't know, it's not a huge deal, I think, for me.

538
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,620
And all those people that are really HDMI was important or something, buy a new system.

539
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,500
Know your old one off, people will buy it, just buy a new system, I mean, just quit your

540
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
bitching.

541
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,860
Comments from our chat room, DDR Dollar Bill says, HDMI, don't care.

542
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,740
Let's see, we have, I believe it was Paradox Vincent said, DS Fat sucks.

543
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,420
And NM64 says, DS Lite is only worth it if you need a new DS or never had one.

544
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,940
So some conflicting opinions there.

545
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
I think the fat is fine.

546
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,700
Did you know the DS fat is actually louder than the DS Lite, which is good for games

547
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,100
like Elite Beat Agents and stuff when you need to drown other people out?

548
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,780
But I do think overall I kind of prefer the Lite, and I'll probably get one eventually.

549
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,580
But knowing Nintendo, there'll be some new color or some new redo they're going to do

550
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,200
before the span of the DS Lite, or the DS in general, is over.

551
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
So I'm waiting for that.

552
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,980
Just like when the Game Boy Advance came out.

553
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,680
I had the Game Boy Advance, the original one, and then they did the SP, and you know, fuck

554
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
that shit.

555
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,300
I am not buying another system all over again.

556
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Nintendo has done this with almost every single one of their consoles, I think.

557
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Remember the Nintendo?

558
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:59,660
They did the top-loading one that looked like the Famicom later on, and then with, well

559
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:05,040
I guess not really the Nintendo 64 or the Super Nintendo, but the 64 they had a rumble

560
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,900
later on, and then you could add the RAM pack later on.

561
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,420
Oh, and they had the Pokemon 64.

562
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,420
Yeah, exactly.

563
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,640
The Pokemon 64.

564
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,020
They always try to pull this shit.

565
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,620
With the little cheek slide up when you turn it on too.

566
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,900
And don't think that they don't know that later on, you know, people are going to buy

567
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,020
an extra DS because it's in a specific color.

568
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,900
I mean, come on, it doesn't, it's not that hard to manufacture the DS in a different

569
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
color.

570
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,580
Ooh, ooh, I just thought though, Microsoft does that too.

571
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,580
They've done it before.

572
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,000
You know what kind of Xbox I have?

573
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't have them.

574
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah.

575
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I don't have the same Xbox most people have.

576
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I have a Halo Xbox.

577
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
That's the see-through green.

578
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I have a Halo Xbox.

579
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's the see-through green.

580
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,240
Yeah, but most people don't have that though.

581
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,700
Most people have the big black brick, right?

582
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,400
My big black brick died.

583
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,820
Microsoft is not beyond redesigning their consoles.

584
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,820
Exactly.

585
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,900
Don't you think there will be a Halo 3 limited edition console, or do you think there will

586
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
just be a faceplate?

587
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,100
They can get it too, back with the Sega support streamcast.

588
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,060
I think the faceplates are what they're doing now.

589
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:02,020
That's a big thing, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a black console later, you know.

590
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,340
I think that's something that's very possible.

591
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
I don't know.

592
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,500
We all know the Wii colors are coming.

593
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
It's just a matter of time.

594
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

595
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Those are coming.

596
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Same with the PlayStation 3 colors.

597
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
You're going to see those as well.

598
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
I mean, come on.

599
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,780
It's just, this is not, I mean, look at the PlayStation 2.

600
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,780
They have silver, pink, I mean, come on.

601
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
It's just, everybody does it.

602
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,580
Because I need something to match my cabinet that I got at IKEA.

603
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,500
Like, oh my God, I got to totally get a pink one for my girlfriend because she's going

604
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
to totally appreciate it.

605
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,260
And when you give it to her, she's like, wow, this is so pretty.

606
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:37,460
What the fuck am I going to play on it?

607
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,980
You know why they keep doing this, you guys?

608
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,980
It's because people are retarded and they will buy this shit.

609
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,660
They will buy a blue DS when it comes out because it's blue.

610
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,020
They'll buy a pink DS when it comes out because it's pink.

611
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,940
Because people are retarded and they don't understand there's websites out there that

612
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,100
make custom colored DS's that you can order brand new in any fucking color of the rainbow

613
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,300
that you want instead of having to wait for Nintendo to put it out.

614
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,740
You know, there's a conversation going on in chat right now that has me thinking a little

615
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
bit.

616
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,940
Do you think, do you think the black Wii will be a little bit bigger than the white Wii?

617
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,780
Yeah, and the yellow Wii is going to be super tiny.

618
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,180
Yeah, okay.

619
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,860
You can address those cards and letters to lowkey at orangelawnsradio.com.

620
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,740
Hey, you started it, okay.

621
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,660
Let's just move right along to talking about Halo 3.

622
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,180
Of course, we were talking about that a little bit.

623
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,640
And the beta testing, right?

624
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,580
You had everybody slam that site, try to get into the beta test.

625
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,380
And you'll find out this month if you got into the beta test.

626
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,780
But if you didn't get in that way, there is the rule of three.

627
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,860
And I don't know why else you would call it that unless you want people to say the rule

628
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:54,300
of three, the mysterious rule of three to get into the Halo 3 beta test.

629
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,340
What's going to happen is that if you play three hours worth of Halo 2 multiplayer between

630
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,940
Thursday the 1st of February and February 3rd, 2007, if you're among one of the first

631
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,780
13,333 to register at Halo3.com right after that, then you will be part of the Halo 3

632
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
beta.

633
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
The other way to get into it?

634
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
Buy Crackdown.

635
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,340
I just buy Crackdown.

636
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,020
I have to be honest, I'm kind of not caring anymore.

637
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,100
Like I know I should think this Halo 3 beta is a big deal and OMG I can be the first on

638
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
my block to play it.

639
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,200
But now I'm to the point where I'm like, you know what, I'll just play the damn thing.

640
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,700
It's going to be buggy, people are going to bitch, I'll just wait for it to...

641
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,100
It was cool when it was like a beta thing and you didn't know how many people were going

642
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,460
to get into it and you thought, oh hey, this is going to be only a couple thousand.

643
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,820
That's kind of cool, you're like in the cool club now.

644
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,260
Now where it's, oh anyone that buys this game will get into the beta, oh and this is another

645
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
way to get into the beta.

646
00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:00,700
Why the fuck is a beta test like fucking incentive to buy something or do something?

647
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,560
You're beta testing something and you don't realize that's actually work.

648
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:11,420
You're working, I mean you're playing a game to find bugs, that's not exactly fun.

649
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,460
Just wait, people, it's only a few more months away, shit.

650
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,460
I don't know, I'm kind of over it, I'll play it when I play it.

651
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,580
I don't have to be the first kid on the block to do it.

652
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,660
Somebody in chat, who said this, said that it would probably fill up within five hours.

653
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,820
Mike W. says that he predicts right here and now that the beta will fill up in five hours.

654
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
I give it three.

655
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:40,020
People will be on their consoles one minute after, play the three hours back to back to

656
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,020
back and then be on Halo 3 immediately.

657
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,620
There will be 13,333 people to do that.

658
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,260
So I don't know why Microsoft bothered to make such a big window, seriously.

659
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,540
I'm just going to buy Crackdown and play Crackdown.

660
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,660
I'm telling you right now, if you want to get in that way, if you're not on there at

661
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,900
midnight ready to play until 3am, forget it, write it off, you're not getting in.

662
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,060
I'm sorry, you know that's how it's going to work.

663
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,060
You know it.

664
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:07,220
There's some people who got to play it anyway.

665
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Oh, oh really?

666
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
Yep.

667
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Oh really?

668
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Yep.

669
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Who?

670
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Let's beat them up, take their lunch money.

671
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,980
I think they could actually beat anyone of us.

672
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,460
Oh really?

673
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,460
Bungie actually flew over copies of the beta to the troops overseas.

674
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,900
Oh yeah, they probably could keep my SCM.

675
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Yeah.

676
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,900
Nevermind.

677
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Hearts.

678
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,140
And basically let them have the free demo for Christmas, give it a try and I think that's

679
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,140
pretty cool.

680
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,140
That's kind of neat.

681
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,600
That's something kind of different and I think a very interesting way and I bet you a lot

682
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,580
of our troops are kind of into Halo 2 and 3 and all that stuff so I think that's kind

683
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
of cool.

684
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,900
And it's a good way I think to relieve some of the stress of having to be there.

685
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,340
I think it was a really good thing.

686
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Yeah.

687
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,340
That's neat.

688
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,340
Yeah.

689
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Good job Bungie.

690
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,300
Anyways, so more stuff for the 360.

691
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,500
You know how they always have themes and stuff on Xbox Live and you know they're so wonderful

692
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,820
how they don't show you what they look like before you buy them.

693
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,780
Well thankfully there is a website now that will show you what they look like called DashboardThemes.com

694
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:20,420
and you can go there before you buy a theme and check out what it looks like and possibly

695
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,380
save your Xbox Live points.

696
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,580
Unfortunately I would just save your Xbox Live points or the other thing you can do

697
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,140
if you have a memory unit just go to your local game store or whatever that has an Xbox

698
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:39,140
360 kiosk and download some of that shit for free because lots of it you pay for online

699
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,620
you can download for free from there.

700
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,740
Although from what I remember reading on this site the people were putting it together with

701
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,180
their own money.

702
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,580
So you know they do deserve some type of you know medallion or recognition from the community

703
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,740
for putting together that public service because for whatever reason Microsoft isn't on top

704
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
of it with their previews.

705
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,280
I mean you can preview some stuff on Xbox.com to be fair but they're not very current and

706
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,140
these guys you know they have it the day it comes out.

707
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:10,500
So I think they deserve a round of applause from the gaming community.

708
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Yay.

709
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Alright.

710
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,100
Well, other surprises that you might find.

711
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,080
What's interesting is that this 14 year old boy who lives in Utah claims that he purchased

712
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,820
a factory sealed copy of Madden 07 for the Xbox 360 and he put the disc in his system

713
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,060
and up came not John Madden but hardcore pornography.

714
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,780
That's a roster update.

715
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:41,500
The boy immediately notified his parents and they're backing up the claim and said this

716
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,560
is legit.

717
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:49,260
Now Electronic Arts was contacted and they're working with the store that the game was bought

718
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,340
from to see if maybe something funny went on here like maybe a disgruntled employee

719
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,700
put some porn in there you know because how easy would it be to print out a Madden label

720
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,900
like on your computer and then take a porn disc and like put it on there.

721
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,100
It's a little harder because those are actually you know silkscreened onto the discs so.

722
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Yeah but if you're 14 and you don't know to look for that kind of stuff I mean don't you

723
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,340
think someone could get away with that?

724
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,760
You'd have to be pretty retarded although he does look pretty retarded.

725
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
You're nice.

726
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,020
You would have to be pretty retarded if you're a 14 year old boy and you get porn and go

727
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,020
tell your parents.

728
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,240
What problem did I know I got porn?

729
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Fuck that shit.

730
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,900
You're hoarding that shit.

731
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
You are putting that in the safest spot.

732
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,960
That's like someone giving you diamonds you're like fuck that shit I'm going to hide this

733
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
shit and no one.

734
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
I'm playing Madden.

735
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Go away!

736
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,660
Keep the door shut I'm playing Madden.

737
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:50,340
Inviting all your friends over to play Madden.

738
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,740
Building a shrine to the Madden disc in your bedroom.

739
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,740
That's beautiful.

740
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,100
Carol dude you're going to see the coolest copy of Madden you've ever seen.

741
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:05,340
EA would quote regrets any embarrassment the matter has caused the family.

742
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,440
That's a way to learn a lesson early.

743
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,960
By the way one other quote that's so great here.

744
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,780
According to a paper in Utah the standard examiner when Mahoney looked at the pornographic

745
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,740
images his first thought was quote this is definitely not Madden.

746
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:27,220
No it's NHL 2000 on Dreamcast.

747
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,340
This looks more like Blitz League what the fuck.

748
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:35,420
Listen up 2K if you want to win this war going on in the football world here's how to do

749
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
it.

750
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,420
More porn.

751
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:43,580
Listen you don't need that's what they need to do NFL xxx just like BMX xxx except it

752
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,620
doesn't have any NFL in it it's more porn.

753
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:50,460
Okay very interesting Jeremy Todd one says Loki wouldn't you rather sue the game company

754
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,500
and get millions rather than keep some porn you can find for free.

755
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,100
You're 14 your parents are going to get that money fuck that shit keep the porn.

756
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:05,780
Ravens Dolphin one said I found porn on my PSP memory card from EB I told nobody.

757
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,060
Yeah was it a used game or a new one?

758
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,300
It's a used game oh that game that was a new factory sealed game.

759
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
That's fun.

760
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:19,600
Fireboma says he notified his parents quote under long review this is porn quote hold

761
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,060
on we have to go review got to go to the bathroom.

762
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:29,500
Well speaking of something that has nothing to do with porn okay it might have been but

763
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,700
that's not official.

764
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,340
Guess who's leaving rare for more porn I mean for for not porn.

765
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,140
The Pinatas.

766
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,580
The Stamper brothers are leaving leaving rare.

767
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,860
Wait didn't they like found it or something yep they were one of the well I guess two

768
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:53,700
of the main folks behind rare and now they're gone by that they've gone to a quote pursue

769
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
other opportunities.

770
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,580
They're like they're all fuck this shit we make no more fucking pinata games fuck this

771
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,780
we want killer instinct.

772
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,780
Well wait wait a damn minute though Viva Pinata was the best thing rares put out in a while

773
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,260
sadly they did put out didn't they.

774
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,460
We promise just make a pinata game and we'll let you make killer instinct.

775
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,300
What I want to know is what if Viva Pinata was not that bad I mean it's actually quite

776
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,420
good it's a pleasant surprise of a game so don't knock it till you've tried it it's pretty

777
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,420
fun game.

778
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,240
I had way more fun with Viva Pinata than cameo and perfect dark zero combined end of story

779
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
end of story.

780
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,900
Okay well perfect dark zero is like bald.

781
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,860
So if that's what yeah I know and I'm like if that's why they left was over Viva Pinata

782
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,460
then bye don't let the door hit your ass on the way out but you know I what I want to

783
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,860
know was did they leave this voluntary or is this one of those nice ways of saying they

784
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,500
were asked to leave because the community was not too receptive to some of the recent

785
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,420
games and I don't believe Viva Pinata is performing very well I don't think it's reaching the

786
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,540
target audience they want I mean critically it's doing well but that doesn't always translate

787
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,960
to money you know what I mean.

788
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,460
There's actually an interview but I have to look a little bit more further into that but

789
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,020
I think it's willing.

790
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,420
Interesting do you think they'll start a rival company?

791
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,180
I hope so.

792
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,420
They should make one called uncommon.

793
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:23,980
Wonder Dog Harold says they're just taking the money and running.

794
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,780
DJ Morpheus says thanks to Viva I can't play my 360 right now and I think that's because

795
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,500
I've seen his woman on there playing Viva Pinata non-stop because she's on my friends

796
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,220
list and I could be looking at my Xbox friends list at one in the afternoon and look who's

797
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,220
online playing Viva Pinata.

798
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,300
You know what would be hilarious is if you smacked that woman enough times that she like

799
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,260
locked up your system for like an hour or something like that.

800
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,260
What?

801
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,460
No I said that'd be funny if it happened you know in the game where you smack her.

802
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,220
Oh I thought you meant Travis's woman I was like that's not nice.

803
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,500
Oh you mean the woman in the game?

804
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Yeah in the game.

805
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
No okay yeah yeah.

806
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,620
No don't you weren't you there when I played that game the first time and I whacked her

807
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,620
with a shovel and she's like you don't want to do that again and so of course what I do

808
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,060
I whacked her in the face with a shovel again and she took my shovel away and I was fucked

809
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
I had to reset the game.

810
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,260
You fucking walk up behind her with a brick and smack her in the back of the head.

811
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,500
Rama says Sky the Viva Pinata cartoon isn't doing too well either.

812
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,620
The cartoon sucks ass I hate that thing.

813
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:26,100
Anyways so one thing that doesn't suck ass is katamari although what does suck ass is

814
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,100
that the fact that it's not coming to Xbox Live Arcade apparently that was a rumor that

815
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:39,940
was going around but of course defused by the worldwide Xbox Live Arcade games portfolio

816
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:47,700
manager Ross Erickson who basically said that the rumor is total crap and is not happening.

817
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:56,460
So yeah no katamari but I'm sure we'll see katamari come to the 360 some point.

818
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,460
You think?

819
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,460
I think so.

820
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,460
Really?

821
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:09,300
I don't know yet about what the future has in store for katamari to tell.

822
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,420
There's going to be more katamari games they registered trademarks already for them so

823
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:20,620
unless they're going to do some fucking katamari cartoon which would be even more cool.

824
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,860
We also have some other interesting rumors going around because the katamari thing started

825
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
as a rumor.

826
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,620
Well now they're saying that radiant silver gun 3 there was a report earlier this week

827
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:37,300
that radiant silver gun 3 was going to be on the Xbox 360.

828
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,820
Also knights is going to be coming to the Wii that would be very interesting knights

829
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
coming to the Wii.

830
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
Knights on the Wii would be fun.

831
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:50,220
Of course the radiant silver gun 3 did get basically confirmed not to be happening.

832
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,020
Yep unfortunately there was a follow up a little later in the week where treasure was

833
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:59,260
giving an interview about what's going on and unfortunately they denied the existence

834
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,020
of radiant silver gun 3.

835
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,940
Go cry a little more about that.

836
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,100
I would like to see radiant silver gun 3.

837
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,660
That's a good shooter.

838
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,100
Knights sounds pretty hot though.

839
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:17,020
At least we still have ikoruga that we can play if we want to get our fix.

840
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,940
Maybe we can get some virtual console games some old school shooters.

841
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,260
I don't know wishful thinking.

842
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,580
I'm still hunting down radiant silver gun for the Saturn.

843
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:31,420
Well if you want there's that one game radio allergy which is coming to gamecube and that

844
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:36,980
one is supposed to be a really good shooter kind of like ikoruga that was coming out this

845
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,780
month but now it's coming out in April I think.

846
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,780
I'm still thinking about getting that dreamcast one that's coming out.

847
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,900
Is it new hope or something?

848
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,940
My dreamcast is in a box sadly.

849
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:52,900
We used to have ours in an xbox kiosk one of those little demo stations we used to have

850
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,900
our dreamcast sitting in one.

851
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,900
What ever happened to your demo station you had?

852
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,180
How much does those things sell for?

853
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,620
I have no idea what we got for it.

854
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,780
Really what how much lucky?

855
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,860
They're like $500 and not more.

856
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,020
Were you looking at that on ebay or something?

857
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,100
I was for a customer they wanted to bring.

858
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,620
You know those things are so hard to get like for even like microsoft for example in order

859
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,900
to get a kiosk into your store you have to be buying lots of microsoft product and then

860
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,580
you get the privilege of buying one from them for like a couple grand it's like thank you

861
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,860
for giving me the privilege to buy one from you you fucking douche when I'm trying to

862
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:33,660
push your product you know and you just don't want to give me a kiosk or sell me a kiosk

863
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,180
I don't understand it but whatever.

864
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:45,220
We do have some news about a new MMO Battlestar Galactica.

865
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:52,340
It had been reported that it was going to be on Xbox 360 exclusively but Vivendi said

866
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:59,100
uh uh no they said that they actually have not announced a Battlestar Galactica game

867
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:07,220
and they cannot comment any more on it so I guess we don't know.

868
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,420
So it's kind of one of those things where it's like it's happening but we're not going

869
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,580
to tell you anything else.

870
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,300
Well they're saying that they might do it there's a rumor at least that there's going

871
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:21,700
to be a smaller one either for PC or something on Xbox Live Arcade but.

872
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,240
I mean like PC is MMO home though it'll be a little silly to not put it out on the PC

873
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,900
especially you know when the Xbox 360 is a PC according to you know something I read

874
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,460
just before we went live tonight you know according to what Bill Gates the Xbox 360

875
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:40,380
is a PC so it doesn't seem logical to put out Battlestar Galactica only on the 360 when

876
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,820
you know there's still the PC market to tap into unless they've signed something with

877
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,740
Microsoft and blood you know that there it's an exclusive thing.

878
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:56,620
Anywho, so we got some street dates for you guys and of course like every week we like

879
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,940
to bring you some exclusive stuff that you may not have heard.

880
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,220
This week I did have a few things on there of course you know being that we put this

881
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,980
show out on Sundays you know some of the stuff has come out during the week two of those

882
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,340
were brand new Ubisoft games whoopee doo.

883
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
First one's cause.

884
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,260
Hold on hold on I want to say before you start getting this stuff out we have to get a little

885
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,540
disclaimer about sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong right because you know

886
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,540
that we.

887
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,540
Hey listen.

888
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
New year new show.

889
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,260
So sometimes these dates are right sometimes they're wrong why are they wrong sometimes?

890
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,660
They're wrong sometimes because they change dates like daily so stuff changes all the

891
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:37,780
time and a company to announce a date initially and have that date stick is like a rarity.

892
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:42,740
This stuff shuffles around and the only reason it shuffles around is development cycles whether

893
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:49,420
they're in behind or headed in development or getting approval from like Sony Microsoft

894
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,460
and Nintendo.

895
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,380
For instance I just to kind of give an example this week actually I should say a long time

896
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,340
ago I want to say it was in like episode 195 or something it was a while ago a long time

897
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:06,680
ago about six months ago you said that Bioshock was coming out in April of 2007.

898
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,120
But then this week we heard that there was a 2K games rep that was posting on some forum

899
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,120
that said it's coming out in June you heard it here first.

900
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,060
So it's kind of like you were in the right ballpark but for whatever reason these developments

901
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,060
have got to push out.

902
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,060
No they changed it.

903
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,180
The same day well actually I think because I don't pay attention to some of these date

904
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,220
changes or don't bother repeating them again but like before the guy came out and said

905
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:32,800
oh yeah by the way this is we had a date change to you know the new new date now.

906
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,180
So I mean it does it it's just a change at all time it's just like trying to think for

907
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:43,620
example Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the PlayStation 3 first it was going to be a launch title

908
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,740
then it was January and then it was February now it's March.

909
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:52,500
So it's like you know some games are just push back and push back and push back.

910
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,700
So I mean I try to report them every time I see them change but you know it changes

911
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,700
a lot.

912
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,620
But what I notice you do get from out of this and you've gotten it right every time I can't

913
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,140
think of a time you've ever been wrong on this is when a new title comes in that hasn't

914
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,760
been announced yet like you know about Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 six months before anybody

915
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,140
ever announced it officially.

916
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,300
Whenever these titles drop in there it's always right.

917
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,300
And Oblivion.

918
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,300
That's what I've noticed.

919
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,300
And Oblivion on PSP.

920
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,300
That's right I remember that from last year.

921
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,340
And Full Auto 2 on PSP.

922
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,340
So is there anything in this list that's new that we don't know about yet?

923
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,340
Well yes.

924
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,340
I do know stuff.

925
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:34,020
Okay first off we mentioned last week driver parallel lines for the PSP which was actually

926
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,580
March 14th was when that was coming out.

927
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:41,900
Now it's being changed to driver 76 so because if you remember driver parallel lines start

928
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,100
off in 1976 and then it comes in the modern time.

929
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,420
So I'm guessing this game is going to be driver parallel lines but just set in 1976.

930
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,380
I didn't know that because the driver series sucks.

931
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,380
Yeah it does.

932
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,880
But that's just happening.

933
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,340
However though I do have a date for you this will make you happy.

934
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,860
Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 March 14th as well.

935
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,000
And we knew that was coming.

936
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,060
Definitely one that was not a big surprise but we don't have a date for that yet.

937
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,540
So that's kind of cool.

938
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,460
New games though that haven't been announced.

939
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,120
Dream Pinball 3D for the Wii coming out October 10th so still weighs off.

940
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,620
And not a huge surprise but Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is going to be coming

941
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:27,460
out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii at mandatory movie time.

942
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,620
PS2!

943
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,620
Not 3.

944
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,620
PS2.

945
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,500
Not a lot of stuff being developed for PlayStation 3.

946
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,340
PlayStation 2 though, lots of stuff.

947
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,340
Interesting.

948
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:42,140
And by the way those two Ubisoft games Cosmic Family and Spelling Spree.

949
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,860
Cosmic Family I hear is meant for really little kids because I guess it's based off a cartoon

950
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:53,860
series or something like that and then Spelling Spree I'm guessing some sort of DS type of

951
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,860
game.

952
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,140
It makes me think like Imagine People driving by in their cars rolling down the window and

953
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,740
like spelling at them to death.

954
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,700
Oh yeah?

955
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,900
Well PRICE DIE!

956
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,780
Well remember we mentioned last week and I haven't seen this anywhere yet but Driver

957
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,020
Parallel Alliance is on the Wii.

958
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,740
That was one of the ones that they didn't mention.

959
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:21,740
Not that I really care to play that on the Wii but I'm just saying letting it be known.

960
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,740
So you heard it here first.

961
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,740
Hopefully.

962
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,740
We think.

963
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:31,820
I can't check the whole internet but as far as I'm aware none of the major sites out there.

964
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,580
The ones backed by magazines and publishing companies.

965
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,420
What about regular release dates for the week?

966
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,560
This week of course January is pretty slow as far as stuff coming out.

967
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,980
Of course the big game this week is going to be Lost Planet which is coming out on the

968
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,900
12th so definitely worth picking up especially if you've played the demo.

969
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,900
Debatable.

970
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,300
I'm not, I'm passing.

971
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,980
I wasn't a fan of the demo sorry.

972
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,980
I'm passing too even though I liked it because I have too many things I'm playing right now

973
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,900
so that's it.

974
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,740
Now PlayStation 2 though not a whole lot coming out.

975
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:09,800
There's Arthur and the Invisibles woohoo and The Shield which sucked ass and was that based

976
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
on the TV show?

977
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Yes.

978
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
That's interesting.

979
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,340
So beyond that there's not a whole lot coming out.

980
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,900
I know there's some DS games, new Yu-Gi-Oh game.

981
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,940
It's pretty light.

982
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,980
Japanese release dates you have a couple big titles coming out.

983
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,300
Atsumare Piñata is coming out January 11th 2007 on 360.

984
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,460
That's the name of Viva Piñata localized for Japan.

985
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:43,660
For the PlayStation 3 you get NBA 07 over there and by the way they have Enchanted Arm

986
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,500
coming out January 25th over in Japan.

987
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,900
Just so you know that's coming up a little sooner but that makes sense.

988
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:56,800
Actually they call it Enchant Arm EM over in Japan too and that was released long before

989
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,980
it was over here last year on the 360.

990
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,180
GT Pro Series coming out for the Nintendo Wii.

991
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,800
I recommend you pass on that one.

992
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,920
Coming out on January 11th for the PlayStation 2.

993
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,960
Not a lot of new stuff.

994
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,380
You do get a couple things going into the best series from Koei including Warship Gunner

995
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,660
2 and Shin Sangoku Musou 3 Empires and Mushoden.

996
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,820
I should note though that.hack//G.U.

997
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,100
Volume 3 is out next week so I know a lot of folks are really into.hack//.

998
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,500
That's on its way out pretty soon.

999
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:40,700
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Zettai Onkan Training DS and DS Dengeki Bunko Ira

1000
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:47,380
no Sora UFO No Natsu is coming out this week January 11th and of course...

1001
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,380
That's funny.

1002
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,380
What?

1003
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,060
I guess UFO of Summer?

1004
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,060
Well I'm looking here.

1005
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:59,460
I'm looking at the box art and once again it's another freaking DS Japan game that has

1006
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,380
funny looking school girls on the cover, all anime style, and it looks like they're flying

1007
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,520
a ship.

1008
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,100
What was the name of the game?

1009
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:11,740
DS Dengeki Bunko Ira No Sora UFO No Natsu.

1010
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,740
Huh.

1011
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,420
That's what it's called.

1012
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,420
Okay.

1013
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,420
Yeah.

1014
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:22,380
But probably most people holding out for, oh never mind it's a US release, never mind.

1015
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,540
I have the sky color.

1016
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,540
Who cares?

1017
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,540
Are any of you really going to import it?

1018
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,540
I didn't think so.

1019
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,540
I will.

1020
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,540
Actually, I'm planning on getting, what was that other game that's not coming out, that

1021
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,740
one that we played for DDR?

1022
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,180
I'm going to import that.

1023
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Which one?

1024
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,180
The...

1025
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,180
They had the intro.

1026
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,180
Oh, Oz.

1027
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,180
Yeah.

1028
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,180
That's an old game.

1029
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,180
I know it's old, but I think I'm going to get it.

1030
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:50,620
Yeah, we played the Oz song, Polyvostian Dance and Chorus, and we played that today and Jamie

1031
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,820
was like, I want that game.

1032
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:59,420
Well, reading from that title, I think it's Ira of Sky something, summer, whatever.

1033
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:06,300
Anyway, we have our UK release dates, if anyone's interested, which I am.

1034
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,740
On the 12th is pretty much what's coming out.

1035
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:14,100
Bionicle Heroes, Children of Mana, both on DS, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition on Xbox

1036
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:23,780
360, Tokobot Plus Mysteries of the Karakuri on PS2, and Warioware Smooth Moves on Wii.

1037
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,860
Yeah, you can't wait for Warioware to come out next...

1038
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,860
I think it's...

1039
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,860
That's next week, isn't it?

1040
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,860
I think it's next week.

1041
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,860
Yeah.

1042
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,860
Cool.

1043
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,860
Yay!

1044
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,860
New game.

1045
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,860
Finally.

1046
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,860
Anyways.

1047
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,860
One new game, though, that we're probably not going to see, at least I hope that God

1048
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:44,100
of War, if you're not going to see this, is a new RPG based on Tingle, that really annoying

1049
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,420
gay fairy from Wind Waker.

1050
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,300
Now he hasn't come out yet, it's just people assuming.

1051
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:55,220
Okay, flaming gay fairy from Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.

1052
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,380
Not that there's anything wrong with that, Loki.

1053
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,100
Nothing wrong with that, he's just super homo flaming gay.

1054
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:08,060
Anyways, so apparently it's, oh God, it's possibly going to head to the US in 2007.

1055
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,420
I was going to say, there is no freaking way this game is not coming to the US at this

1056
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:13,420
point.

1057
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,820
If they're going out of their way to put it out in Europe, you know it's coming here.

1058
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,020
You know it's going to, because the English version will already exist, it's got to come

1059
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,020
here.

1060
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,020
What about Mother 3?

1061
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,020
Didn't that come out in the...

1062
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,060
I don't think it did come out over there.

1063
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,660
It came out in Japan, of course.

1064
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,020
But I thought there was one game that got translated for the UK but never came out over

1065
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,020
here.

1066
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,860
That's funny, it's not going to be Tingle RPG, it can't.

1067
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,420
That was Mother 3.

1068
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,220
Not with the freaking petition going on and everything.

1069
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,020
There's people out there that want their tingle.

1070
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,100
Tingle.

1071
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,420
You know you're going to want this game, Loki.

1072
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,420
You're going to buy it.

1073
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,420
Nellie's going to make you buy it.

1074
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,420
I'm not buying it.

1075
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,420
Nellie's going to make you buy it.

1076
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,420
She will not make me buy this stuff.

1077
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,860
I will show it to her and then she'll make you buy it.

1078
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,620
I want to play the Tingle RPG, it'll be fun.

1079
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,420
Jamie, will you play the Tingle RPG?

1080
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,420
Maybe.

1081
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,420
Alright.

1082
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,220
When I'm out of school.

1083
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:06,780
Nm64 would like to point out, Loki, Tingle was in Majora's Mask.

1084
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,300
JeremyTod1 says, fact, Rob tried to try out for the role of Tingle but Nintendo rejected

1085
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,300
him.

1086
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,300
Aw, sad.

1087
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,460
That is, you know it's true though that I do have this secret desire, I've always wanted

1088
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,220
to be a voice actor in a game, I think that would be fun.

1089
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,940
That would be a lot of fun, don't you?

1090
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,180
A voice actor in a game?

1091
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,460
Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?

1092
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,740
Well not Tingle, God no, but you know, something.

1093
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,700
We could be a soldier that gets shot in Halo 3 or something.

1094
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,740
I mean, I don't even know what the hell you'd do in that.

1095
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,740
Oh, Tingle!

1096
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,500
I'm like, I'll flame that game!

1097
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,860
Oh my God, Loki, you should do it!

1098
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:44,140
I'm not going to be Tingle.

1099
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:48,740
I want someone to create a petition right now on that site, whatever that petition site

1100
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,740
is.

1101
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,740
Loki for Tingle!

1102
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,820
Does Tingle have a hag in that game?

1103
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,820
I don't know.

1104
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,820
I don't remember.

1105
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:58,340
Holy God!

1106
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:03,220
Thank you, insider information says, thank God it's not coming.

1107
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,060
Holy Shonen says, Tingle funny, but I want him dead.

1108
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,980
I don't think he'd sell well over here, it's too annoying.

1109
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,860
People will say, fuck this Tingle shit, we want more Zelda.

1110
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,660
Well something else that won't come out over here is new music games for the PSP.

1111
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,660
Interesting huh?

1112
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:29,220
Sony is denying that a frequency sequel and a new music game called Traxion for the PSP

1113
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:35,100
were not denied by them, but apparently Harmonix spoke to IGN recently, and the team behind

1114
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:42,100
frequency said, this is what Sony did, Sony denied Traxion and the frequency sequel for

1115
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,100
the PSP.

1116
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:47,740
Traxion was killed months ago, months ago that thing was gone.

1117
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,100
Harmonix proposed the sequel on the handheld, but Sony said no.

1118
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,220
On top of that, LucasArts was going to bring that game Traxion, I'm sorry, it was LucasArts

1119
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:59,460
not Harmonix bringing Traxion, and that was also axed.

1120
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:05,740
I know for a fact, Sony likes to pass on games they should not be passing on.

1121
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:13,200
I'm shocked that they would, with all the fear that Red Octane is causing right now

1122
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:20,820
with Guitar Hero and everything, I'm shocked that they would deny them to make a music

1123
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,820
game on the PSP.

1124
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:26,020
Especially when you have frickin' Taiko no Tatujin, which is a stupid game.

1125
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,860
I don't understand Sony's logic with the games they're not allowing through, it doesn't make

1126
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,300
sense to me at all.

1127
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,020
Bad move Sony, because you know, if you do this enough times to Harmonix, and Microsoft

1128
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,820
who's going to probably be a little more welcoming, hey you want to develop for us, yeah great,

1129
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,580
we want games on the console, you know what, that's where that game's going to end up.

1130
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:49,340
And what about, well I guess Luminous isn't really a music game, I don't know.

1131
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,780
But it has happy music.

1132
00:56:51,780 --> 00:57:00,020
Well, there is a rumor floating around about another game coming out on Xbox 360 that's,

1133
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,020
I think it has a little bit to do with the announcement of Virtua Fighter 5 coming out

1134
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:11,360
on Xbox 360, but the rumor now is for Tekken 6 on Xbox 360.

1135
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:19,260
It was the same person, quote, IG an insider, who was also credited for letting the news

1136
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:26,500
out for Virtua Fighter 5, and so if it's out, I mean, it's not like it hasn't been done

1137
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,380
before, you know, that's come out on a non-Sony system.

1138
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:35,060
We've had the Game Boy Advance one, remember Tekken Advance?

1139
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,180
I try not to.

1140
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,540
I actually own that game, and I thought it was okay.

1141
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,580
And then I've got the Blingcast Tekken 3.

1142
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,580
So...

1143
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,580
Alright.

1144
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,700
Are you, what would you think being a Tekken fangirl that you are, what would you think

1145
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,740
about this coming to the 360?

1146
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,980
Is that good news, bad news?

1147
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,560
Because Tekken, I do always kind of put Tekken with Sony.

1148
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,380
I mean, you know, because think about Sony's version of Soul Calibur 2 had Heihachi as

1149
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,380
the bonus character.

1150
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,540
You know, Tekken's always been a very Sony thing.

1151
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:10,940
This, the timing and everything of this seems a little fanboy to me.

1152
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:15,780
I don't think, I think this is just the negative Sony ball keeps on rolling and people are

1153
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,780
saying this.

1154
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,780
I don't think this is legit.

1155
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,300
There was also, though, them saying, you remember Soul Calibur for the longest time was a Sony

1156
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,300
exclusive.

1157
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,300
Mm-hmm.

1158
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:29,860
Yeah, we had three releases of Soul Calibur, what was it, Soul Calibur 2 on various systems,

1159
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,700
each with their own bonus character.

1160
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,140
I'm not going to say yea or nay, but I don't think it's far-fetched.

1161
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,140
Alright.

1162
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:41,900
Well, it's just there's not a lot, even though, despite what Sony says, oh, we're meeting

1163
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,900
our numbers.

1164
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:46,060
I'm like, yeah, they're lower numbers that they keep saying.

1165
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,620
The meeting the numbers that they spew out of their ass.

1166
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,420
Going back to the previous story for a minute, I just want to say, God, I love the chatters.

1167
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:59,820
Took not even five minutes and look at this, Ipetitions.com slash petition slash Loki Tingle,

1168
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:05,820
all one word, and the petition reads, simply, Loki should be the Tingle in the next Legend

1169
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,820
of Zelda game.

1170
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,820
Beautiful.

1171
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,820
I'm going to sign it right now.

1172
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,260
I know, I'm going to go sign it as well while the next story is being read.

1173
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,260
Okie dokie.

1174
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:22,300
Anyways, so if you want to get your Tekken fix on the Playstation 3 right now, you can

1175
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,660
definitely if you're in Japan, because Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection is out there, but if you're

1176
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:33,180
in another region, fear not, there is a work around just like they have for the Xbox 360

1177
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,380
for their demos.

1178
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,020
You can actually do this.

1179
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,300
First what you need to do on your Playstation 3 is create a new user account for your Playstation

1180
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,300
3.

1181
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,060
It cannot be an existing new or existing user or sub-user.

1182
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,380
It has to be completely from scratch.

1183
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:52,140
Once you've done that, simply enter in all the credit card information and pick the country

1184
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,700
as Hong Kong and then choose any city.

1185
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:01,880
Once you've done all that stuff, what you do is you add money to your account, but you

1186
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:12,780
have to do it an amount below $50, and that's $50 I believe in Hong Kong dollars, so roughly

1187
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:17,740
add I believe $40 in Hong Kong twice.

1188
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:23,840
And once you've done that, I guess that is just under the radar for confirming your address

1189
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
or something like that.

1190
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:31,140
Once you've done that, you're able to purchase the Tekken Dark Resurrection game from Japan.

1191
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,900
You better hurry up and do it now because you know Sony is going to close the loophole

1192
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,460
on that within days.

1193
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:42,020
So if you really want to do that now or just wait for it to come out, because it will come

1194
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,020
out eventually.

1195
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:50,400
Speaking of older titles but things that you can download online, Major Nelson published

1196
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,300
this week the top Xbox Live games of 2006, and so since we were talking about downloadable

1197
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,700
titles, we'll talk first about the top arcade titles.

1198
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:05,700
So let's talk about the top purchased arcade titles according to Major Nelson's list, starting

1199
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:10,020
off with number 20 was Luminous Live, which I thought was kind of low on the list, 19

1200
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:17,180
Cloning Clyde, 18 Small Arms, 17 Feeding Frenzy, 16 Bejeweled 2, 15 Texas Hold'em, 14 Zuma,

1201
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:24,980
13 Contrast, 12 Smash TV, 11 Bankshot Billiards 2, 10 Frogger, 9 Gauntlet, 8 Galaga, 7 Ultimate

1202
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:36,500
Mortal Kombat 3, 6 Doom, 5 Pac-Man, 4 Marble Blast Ultra, 3 Geometry Wars Evolved, 2 Street

1203
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:42,140
Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting, and 1 was Uno, which isn't very surprising.

1204
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:50,900
Plus it was one of those ones that had porn and stuff, so not a huge surprise.

1205
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:58,700
As far as the top Xbox 360 titles, 20 Splinter Cell Double Agent, 19 Battlefield, 18 Tom

1206
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:05,380
Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, 17 Need for Speed Most Wanted, 16 Dead Rising, 15 Madden NFL

1207
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:10,540
07, 14 Texas Hold'em, 13 Dead or Alive 4, 12 Geometry Wars Evolved, because remember

1208
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:16,940
they are counting everything here, 11 Saints Row, 10 EA Sports Fight Night Round, 3, 9

1209
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:24,500
Uno, 8 Call of Duty 3, 7 Perfect Dark Zero, 6 Project Gotham Racing 3, 5 Oblivion, 4 Ghost

1210
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:31,540
Recon 3, 3 Call of Duty 2, 2 Hexic HD, because it was on all the hard drives, which is surprising

1211
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,660
because they left that off the arcade titles list, and I thought that was an arcade title,

1212
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:36,660
but never mind.

1213
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:42,380
And number one, Gears of War, of course, no big surprise there.

1214
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:48,460
Alright, well one thing we like to do every week here on Orange Launch Radio is we let

1215
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:52,980
Dark Sakura have a moment to surf the web up and down, back and forth, and share with

1216
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,260
you all the website that she believes was the best one she found all week long.

1217
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,180
We call it Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.

1218
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:09,700
Well, my website of the week goes back to my love of digital art, and this is photoshopsupport.com.

1219
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:18,420
Tutorials, tools, resources, there's a good link with lots of brushes, lots of good stuff

1220
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,420
on it.

1221
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:27,500
There's even free stock photos, there's flash resources, Dreamweaver resources, fonts, textures,

1222
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,500
you name it.

1223
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,060
That is really, really freaking cool.

1224
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:40,780
So I'm going to vote photoshopsupport.com as my website of the week.

1225
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,780
So surf there right now, one more time Dark Sakura.

1226
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,780
Photoshopsupport.com.

1227
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,060
If you can't spell it, I ain't spelling it out for you.

1228
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,060
There you go.

1229
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:54,020
Well, one thing that we're not spelling is lawsuit for-

1230
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:57,020
L-A-W-S-U-I-T lawsuit.

1231
01:03:57,020 --> 01:03:59,180
L-A-W-S-U-I-T-T-E-D.

1232
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,180
Is this spelled right?

1233
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:09,820
So yeah, the lawsuit between OverGuitarHero with, of course, guitars, and between Red

1234
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:15,740
Octane, Activision, and the Ant Commandos, well, they've decided to settle.

1235
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:22,500
And apparently what's happening now is they're just able to make the guitars, you know, they've

1236
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:28,100
kind of buried the hatchet, I guess, and allowing the Ant Commandos to still make their third

1237
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:33,220
party guitars, and yeah, that's pretty much it.

1238
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,620
Everyone's kind of going their own way.

1239
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,120
Which makes sense, since, well, you know, Red Octane, they fucking made third party

1240
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:44,980
guitars for a long time now, I mean, come on, this is like, I don't know, what's-

1241
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:48,760
It sounds to me like they kissed a mate up somehow, one way or another.

1242
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,740
Someone blew somebody, I think.

1243
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:58,580
But anyways, yeah, so all that's better now, it doesn't really matter anyways, because

1244
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:01,060
if you wanted to wire this guitar, you can always buy the official one, I guess.

1245
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,740
Did you see the Guitar Hero 2 360 box art?

1246
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:08,380
No, I didn't get to pull that up at work, I saw that.

1247
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,620
I think there's a story coming up on it later in Part B, at least specifically what's

1248
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:14,660
in the game, so I won't spoil that, but the box art's very interesting because it's

1249
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,380
all white, and it's so weird because you're just thinking, you know, you see the Guitar

1250
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:22,060
Hero boxes, they're black, but of course, this is more the Xbox 360's color scheme,

1251
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,060
so it's kind of interesting.

1252
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,820
They just look different to me.

1253
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,260
One other thing that looked kind of different to me when I first saw this was the screenshots

1254
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,060
for SimCity on the DS.

1255
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:35,760
Some screenshots were recently leaked to the internet from SimCity DS.

1256
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,540
What I thought was interesting is that the host of SimCity DS is Will Wright.

1257
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,820
Even in the Japanese version, there's this little cartoon character of Will Wright that's

1258
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,040
sort of your guide.

1259
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,320
I think the mayor in the old school SimCity on Super Nintendo, which is a virtual console

1260
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:53,460
game now, Will Wright is kind of performing that role.

1261
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:58,540
Now, SimCity DS is not based on the old SimCity, but it looks like it runs on, I think it's

1262
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,460
either the 2000 or the 3000 engine.

1263
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,780
I think it's SimCity 3, not 2000.

1264
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:09,400
It looks a little too in-depth, or they might have enhanced it a little bit, but either

1265
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:15,780
way, it's that more 3D ISO type of view than the old school SimCity was.

1266
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,680
I was only really a fan of the first SimCity game.

1267
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:24,380
I didn't really get into the series after that, but I know it's a very good simulation

1268
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,780
type game.

1269
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:28,700
I would like to see maybe old school Civilization on the DS.

1270
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:29,700
I don't know.

1271
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,700
Maybe.

1272
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,700
Maybe that's just me.

1273
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,380
Then again, there was old school Civilization, I think, on the Super Nintendo, and it kind

1274
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,380
of blew.

1275
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:36,380
We'll see.

1276
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:42,400
Well, as far as other things that remain to be seen, I don't know how much we're going

1277
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:50,700
to agree with this, but Eurogamer posted their top 50 games of 2006, and I've got the top

1278
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,700
10.

1279
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,180
So, if anyone would like to know, I'll read them off.

1280
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,180
Sure.

1281
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,180
Why not?

1282
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,260
I guess one more best of 06 list to close us out.

1283
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:08,740
Number 10 is Professor Kawashima's Brain Training, How Old Is Your Brain?

1284
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:12,220
Number 9 is Wii Sports.

1285
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,220
Wii Sports is good.

1286
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:14,900
Number 8 is Viva Pinata.

1287
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,700
I guess I need to actually play that, huh?

1288
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,860
Seven is Gears of War.

1289
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:23,940
Six is Lego Star Wars II.

1290
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:30,260
Those games are actually pretty fun, but I got really pissed off at the one that came

1291
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:33,700
out a year before.

1292
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:37,940
Five is Dead Rising, because there's something really awesome about running over zombies

1293
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:41,780
with a lawnmower and cutting their heads off with a scythe.

1294
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,500
Four is Final Fantasy XII.

1295
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:49,820
Three is The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which Dan and I are currently playing through.

1296
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,940
Two is Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

1297
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,500
And the number one game is...

1298
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,500
Your mom.

1299
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,500
Cooking Mama.

1300
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,500
No, Guitar Hero.

1301
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,500
Really?

1302
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,900
Yes, Guitar Hero won number one.

1303
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,180
Oh, because that just came out in Europe this year.

1304
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,580
Ah, okay, okay.

1305
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:06,580
I can see that.

1306
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:12,180
And to quote one of the folks from Eurogamer, Keza says, If you don't like Guitar Hero,

1307
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,620
you have no soul.

1308
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:18,340
I have to admit, though, I'm getting a little burned out on the guitar hero list.

1309
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:20,620
I'm a little burned out on it.

1310
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:24,860
It's not God's gift to video games like the media is portraying it to be.

1311
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,860
It's really not.

1312
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:28,200
I love Guitar Hero, but I found out I can't play it drunk.

1313
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:32,580
I feel like I've been playing music games for years, and not to sound elitist or anything,

1314
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:36,740
so I'm sorry if I sound that way, I understand Guitar Hero made the music game genre more

1315
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,740
accessible.

1316
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,740
Don't get me wrong.

1317
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,740
And I do think it's a good game.

1318
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,820
I think it's a great game, in fact.

1319
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:44,980
But I don't think it's like, you know, oh, sound the chorus of angels.

1320
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,380
Fucking Guitar Freaks 2DX, basically.

1321
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,100
I feel like I've kind of seen this before.

1322
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,100
What's so freaking great about it?

1323
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,620
But I guess it's just that it made it more accessible through the fact that as much as

1324
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:03,900
we have loved Konami's Bomani title, they've never really fully been Americanized, if that

1325
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,900
makes sense.

1326
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:07,780
Whenever they try to Americanize them, it doesn't always work, because I think they're

1327
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:14,420
letting the Japanese teams Americanize the games, and that doesn't work.

1328
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,940
Speaking of top tens, I never posted mine to the site, so I'm going to read it for you

1329
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:18,940
now.

1330
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:21,100
Would you like to know my top ten games of 2006?

1331
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,100
That's okay.

1332
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,100
Well, too bad.

1333
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,860
I'm going to tell you anyway.

1334
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:26,180
I did like Eurogamer's List, though.

1335
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:27,500
You know why I like Eurogamer's List?

1336
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,660
Because I like their reviews over there, because, you know, they will tell it like it is over

1337
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,660
there.

1338
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:34,660
So that was interesting to hear that.

1339
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,660
But now mine.

1340
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:40,040
And here's the ones that I thought were the ten best games of 2006.

1341
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,660
Number ten, I said Sneak King on the 360.

1342
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:47,320
And I know you might think I'm crazy, but get this.

1343
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:52,500
It was an original title, the game was four bucks, and it was probably better than most

1344
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,680
of the games that Xbox released in arcade for five or more.

1345
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,700
So if you think about it, it's one of the best gaming values of the year, and it absolutely

1346
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,820
deserves recognition.

1347
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,200
I think it came off better than anyone thought it would.

1348
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:08,340
So you know, Sneak King, I know it seems weird to put it on a top ten list, but I felt it

1349
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,000
needed some type of recognition for kind of what it did.

1350
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,420
It did something really, really original in many ways.

1351
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,900
Number nine, I said Phantasy Star Universe.

1352
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:21,780
And the reason why I said that is because you have massive replayability over previous

1353
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,740
versions of Phantasy Star Online in my mind.

1354
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:27,420
You have single player mode, and that would be the type of game that usually you'd think

1355
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,260
would be sold by itself, but on top of that you have the online mode, rationed unlocks

1356
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,980
that kind of keep the game going, and makes the world ever expanding, keeps online mode

1357
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,980
fresh.

1358
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,660
Number eight, I said Kingdom Hearts 2, which I think far too many people overlooked amongst

1359
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,140
the 2006 releases.

1360
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,660
It was an epic game in every sense of the word, made improvements to the original, kept

1361
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:51,980
a fresh storyline, and even if you consider that some of the old worlds from the first

1362
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:54,660
game return, I mean, they kept it fresh.

1363
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,660
It's amazing.

1364
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:59,660
Yes, it has a three hour opening, but the fact that it's got like the year's probably

1365
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:04,540
one of the best soundtracks of the year, amazing visuals, and fucking Tron World.

1366
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,540
Enough said.

1367
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,540
Tron World.

1368
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,920
One of the best games of the year.

1369
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,300
Number seven, I said Trauma Center Second Opinion, because you know, this is proof that

1370
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,260
games do not have to have great graphics to be fun.

1371
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:19,740
It was originally hailed as truly original on the DS, and it really feels like on the

1372
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,100
Wii, this is how the game always should have been, and it's probably the most grossly

1373
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,020
underlooked and underrated Wii launch title.

1374
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,420
It definitely deserved a place in the top ten of the year.

1375
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:31,380
Number six, I said New Super Mario Brothers on the DS.

1376
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:35,500
Nintendo certainly knows how to milk its retro franchises for all they are worth, but New

1377
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:39,360
Super Mario Brothers takes this old formula, gives it a kick in the pants.

1378
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,100
This is the game people wanted on the GameCube.

1379
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,100
Everybody wanted to see a game like this on the GameCube, and for whatever reason Nintendo

1380
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,900
said, now we'll put it on the DS.

1381
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:53,540
And it's like, people read our minds and they got it when, you know, we say that the next

1382
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:57,140
generation of gaming, you don't have to make everything in 3D.

1383
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:01,420
You can make visually appealing 2D games, and New Super Mario Brothers was it.

1384
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:05,380
So definitely it was one of the best titles of the year.

1385
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,940
Number five, I said Dead Rising on the 360, because it's an absolutely original concept

1386
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,100
for a game that just feels fun.

1387
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:16,020
You're running over zombies with a lawnmower, for God's sake.

1388
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,380
The greatest thing about the game to me is that you just kind of pick it up and have

1389
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:22,580
fun with it, and just like any sandbox type game, you can just say screw it to the stories

1390
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,300
and go decapitate zombies, and it's awesome.

1391
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:28,300
Number four would be Final Fantasy XII.

1392
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:32,840
The game is not aging at all, it's reinventing itself as many times as Madonna has, having

1393
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,140
a fresh story, and the battle system is phenomenal.

1394
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,300
It feels simple in the game's first hours, but as you play more, it gets so engaging,

1395
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,580
and it's great.

1396
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:48,260
16.99 widescreen support in the US helps the game kind of keep up with the next gen of

1397
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,260
gaming.

1398
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,460
Unfortunately, I think it was maybe released a little too late for enough people to notice

1399
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:58,940
this title, but it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy roleplaying games at all.

1400
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:02,040
Number three, I said Elite Beat Agents on the DS.

1401
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,580
It's probably, honestly, one of the best music video games of all time, period.

1402
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:10,020
There's no fancy controller that you have to embarrass yourself with, you just pick

1403
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:14,740
up the pen and you go, hilarious cutscenes, diverse soundtrack, it's an awesome game,

1404
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,260
and it's better than Oh and Don, sorry.

1405
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:21,380
Number two, I said Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, simply the good graphics.

1406
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,860
You go anywhere you want in a huge world, it's so big it's overwhelming, it's phenomenal,

1407
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:30,360
and then you have all these downloadable expansions to it that just keep the game freaking going

1408
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,060
and going and going.

1409
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,060
It's an incredible achievement.

1410
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,580
And then, of course, as I said last week, number one would be The Legend of Zelda Twilight

1411
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,540
Princess.

1412
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:42,980
Just the fact that you've got the new Wii controls on it, you have these clever new

1413
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:47,100
items added to the Zelda universe to kind of make use of that, and the story elements

1414
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,100
and everything.

1415
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,420
It's just a phenomenal title that was well worth the wait.

1416
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,420
There you have it.

1417
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,140
Those are my top ten of the year.

1418
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:57,420
Anyone else want to expand on what they thought were the best games of the year?

1419
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:01,540
I have my top ten list in your email, but I don't know what it was off the top of my

1420
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,540
head.

1421
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:03,540
Let me know what you want real quick.

1422
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,540
Jamie, anything you want to add?

1423
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:05,540
Cookie Mama!

1424
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:13,420
Loki, I'll read them off and you can explain your picks if you want.

1425
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,300
Well, you should read off what I put on there because it was funny.

1426
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,300
Fine, hold on.

1427
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,300
Let's see, what do we got?

1428
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,300
I have...

1429
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,860
Okay, here we go.

1430
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,220
Loki picked Final Fantasy XII.

1431
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:24,620
This is the number ten best game of the year.

1432
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:27,860
I'm sure somewhere in the video game top list guidelines it says we are required to put

1433
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,260
at least one Final Fantasy game in any top ten list.

1434
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,820
So this year it's Final Fantasy XII.

1435
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,940
It's sexy, new, and everyone wants to be it.

1436
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,300
It'll be its friends.

1437
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:39,540
That is until Final Fantasy XIII comes out, all fifty different versions of it.

1438
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,380
Loki said number nine was Dead Rising.

1439
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,380
Dawn of the Dead, the game, I mean Dead Rising was pretty awesome.

1440
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,640
Although I wish the save system wasn't thought up by brainless zombies.

1441
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,780
Loki said the number eight game of 2006 was Call of Duty 3.

1442
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:54,980
Call of Duty 2 was an incredible game and this one only improves on the formula even

1443
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:56,720
better if you have surround sound.

1444
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:01,180
Loki said the number seven game of the year was New Super Mario Bros.

1445
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:03,460
I think these are in no particular order also.

1446
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,460
Oh really?

1447
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,460
It's just my top ten.

1448
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,460
Oh, well too bad.

1449
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,540
I'm assuming this is the order.

1450
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:11,180
I didn't realize Super Mario Bros. 3 and a half could be so much fun.

1451
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,700
I guess you can't beat the old 2D platformer days.

1452
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,660
I just hope we get some more like this on every system.

1453
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:21,900
Number six was Gears of War, the killer app before Halo 3, a very intense and albeit hard

1454
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:22,900
game.

1455
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,180
Number five was Twilight Princess.

1456
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,740
We've waited so long for New Zelda.

1457
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,700
It's everything we could have wanted.

1458
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,940
Number four was Excite Truck.

1459
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,780
I guess that's why you said this is in no order.

1460
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:37,020
Who in their right mind would put Excite Truck above Twilight Princess, you idiot?

1461
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,020
Me?

1462
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:39,460
Okay, now read.

1463
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:43,920
It looks like Nintendo's BEA to the punch for a burnout off-road, a great launch game

1464
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,620
for the Wii that converted at least two non-gamers, my wife and extrovert, into full-fledged gamers.

1465
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,460
All right, that's a good point, good point.

1466
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,520
Number three, Saints Row.

1467
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,660
It's like Grand Theft Auto three and a half.

1468
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,820
I spent countless lunches hurling grenades and rockets at cops while speeding away on

1469
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,980
my riced-out minifan.

1470
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:05,260
I'll be playing this game until Saints Row 2 comes out or Grand Theft Auto 4.

1471
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,020
According to Loki, the number two best game of the year was Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

1472
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:12,620
I have to give props to a game that would let me rob a guild bear, punch a deer, and

1473
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:16,740
set fire to civilians in the course of one day and wearing nothing but a loincloth.

1474
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:19,420
Well said, well said.

1475
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:23,640
And the number one game according to Loki in 2006, and I totally disagree, Grand Theft

1476
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:25,860
Auto Vice City Stories.

1477
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,420
Despite its incredibly flawed targeting system and rather frustrating glitches, Grand Theft

1478
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:33,860
Auto Vice City Stories is the most fun you'll ever have on the PSP ad hoc multiplayer.

1479
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:37,820
I can only hope that GTA IV is up to this level of fun just for the love of God beta

1480
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,260
the multiplayer more than five minutes, and I think exactly for those reasons that the

1481
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:45,060
fact that it had some bad beta-ing, you should not have put that game anywhere near your

1482
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,060
top ten.

1483
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,340
It was in no particular order, that's why I put it there, so whatever.

1484
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,600
All right, there you go.

1485
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:54,700
And then NM64 says, Loki admitted his wife's a gamer.

1486
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,420
JV Mon says, Rob, I would put Excite Trek before Zelda.

1487
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:00,340
I don't know, you guys, it's a good game.

1488
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:05,380
I think Excite Trek is horribly underrated, and it probably would be in my top fifteen,

1489
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:09,180
but the worst part about Excite Trek is that it was too short.

1490
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,180
That's it.

1491
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,380
That was the worst part about it.

1492
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,740
All right, Jamie has a list she'd like to share.

1493
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:19,940
Okay, my number ten is actually DDR Supernova, just because it's bringing DDR back to the

1494
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:24,340
arcade, giving everybody what they want, and I think that's a good thing, it's sort of

1495
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:27,500
help rebuilding the whole community, and that makes me happy.

1496
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,580
And nine is the Super Mario Brothers, just because it's Super Mario Brothers, and that

1497
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,660
game's actually kind of hard.

1498
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:38,380
Eight is the Resistance Fall of Man, because it's pretty, and you explode heads and stuff.

1499
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:42,220
And I actually like Guitar Hero 2, so it's on there for my number seven.

1500
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:46,000
And number six is Trauma Center, because that game's fucking frustrating and evil and has

1501
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,220
people screaming loudly at their DS's.

1502
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:56,020
And then five is Wii Sports, because it's actually kind of fun.

1503
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,380
Four would be Zelda.

1504
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,060
Three is Pirates of the Caribbean Pinball.

1505
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:01,620
What?

1506
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,020
Okay.

1507
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:06,820
You really thought outside the box for your picks.

1508
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,860
Well, you are a pinball whore, I'll take it.

1509
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:11,380
No, I'm married to a pinball whore, that's a different story.

1510
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,380
I understand, I understand.

1511
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:16,580
Two is going to be all the Flash games on the Doctor Who website.

1512
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,740
Oh my god, you loser.

1513
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,460
Your list just lost all credibility.

1514
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,460
Hey!

1515
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:27,940
I like the game where he's the drawing and you have to walk through the thing.

1516
01:18:27,940 --> 01:18:28,940
Failed.

1517
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:29,940
Clank.

1518
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:33,500
And one is Cooking Mama, of course.

1519
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,320
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

1520
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:39,700
You're the only gamer girl I can think of that would put Cooking Mama at the top of

1521
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,600
her list with pride.

1522
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,600
Very well done.

1523
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,600
It's great!

1524
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,200
Cooking Mama is awesome!

1525
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,980
Next year, her number one game will be Driving Training.

1526
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:49,980
What?

1527
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:54,260
Because you know, you're a woman.

1528
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,260
This is good radio.

1529
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:58,380
Unless you can't see me flip you off.

1530
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:02,900
And on that note, we should probably go to break while Dark Sakura kicks my ass out in

1531
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,220
the parking lot.

1532
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:11,300
So we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio Part B.

1533
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:16,020
