1
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:24,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, January 7th, 2007, Xbox 360 upgrade rumors abound, Nintendo partners with an MMO developer, and prepared to waste even more time with Elder Scrolls Oblivion.

2
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:37,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back, live listeners, to a new year of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:41,052
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that radio program on the interweb dedicated...

4
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Video Games, Gamer Culture, and the Gamer Lifestyle

5
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:05,786
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR was fun today.

6
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:07,689
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good times.

7
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well to recently upgraded Techmaster Loki.

8
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with more anger and angst.

9
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:15,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,383
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

11
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:18,785
[SPEAKER_03]: You going to Macworld?

12
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, totally.

13
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:22,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm there.

14
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, welcome by the way if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

15
00:01:27,575 --> 00:01:31,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we got some new listeners while we were off on holiday for a little while.

16
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks as well to all the sites that joined us last week for the New Year's Eve special.

17
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:40,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they turned around and pimped us.

18
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,311
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:14,960
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all met up and we just decided, you know, because DarkSakura and I had kind of known each other a little bit before that.

20
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:20,847
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing another radio program under Station Live and we thought, hey, let's do a show about video games.

21
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:21,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

22
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:25,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, Loki joined us for that and here we are almost five years later and

23
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Still doing it.

24
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:27,573
[SPEAKER_03]: No life.

25
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:37,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The show started about music video games, so sometimes you hear Orange Lounge Radio, the Bobani radio station, which, you know, we still love our music-based games, but we like to think that we are gaming fans first.

26
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,876
[SPEAKER_03]: We just love video games in general, so that's what the show's all about now.

27
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:46,857
[SPEAKER_03]: The show we try to present to you guys here every week is that we go over the news, and yeah, you know, we only do a show once a week.

28
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:52,018
[SPEAKER_03]: We only do a show once a week, so you're not always going to get the latest and greatest here.

29
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:52,138
[SPEAKER_03]: We do...

30
00:02:53,098 --> 00:03:00,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the fortunate luck of having Loki working in the industry in an area that most media doesn't think to look in, which is distribution.

31
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes we get some pretty good exclusives that way.

32
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:11,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, you know, we're kind of like we imagine one thing we used to do when we were at the arcades is that, you know, remember when we did like the Wednesday night, we'd get together, play DDR.

33
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:12,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what do we do afterwards?

34
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Brookfields and just, you know, talk.

35
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we nerd.

36
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we ate a lot and then we nerded out talking about stuff.

37
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:21,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of what we are.

38
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:25,984
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the folks sitting around the dinner table at your local diner

39
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Talkin' about games and talkin' smack when appropriate and talkin' about good things.

40
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:35,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like to invite guests to our table once in a while from the gaming industry, hoping to have some good names on in 2007.

41
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,120
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like to invite all of you.

42
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,882
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to fill up the restaurant with our listeners.

43
00:03:39,423 --> 00:03:45,468
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that the majority of our listeners catch us on the audio blog, also known as podcast, which is released every Monday and Wednesday.

44
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:47,450
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have our live listeners.

45
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,435
[SPEAKER_03]: We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on Orange Lounge Radio, orangeloungeradio.com.

46
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:55,417
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:13,395
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Pump Up the Volume and then something unannounced that we'll be filling in the gaps on Tuesday in the interim.

48
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:17,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Wednesday nights we have Guys on a Show, which is kind of like pop culture, geek culture stuff.

49
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday nights, STFU, which is really like fast-paced game talk.

50
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:22,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like a sports show.

51
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:26,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday nights we have Club OLR, which is just strictly music.

52
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:30,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, if you missed this week's Club OLR, you did a fantastic job mixing music this week, Loki.

53
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:31,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just saying that.

54
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:32,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

55
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:32,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

56
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:33,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was great.

57
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you do a rip-off of something else?

58
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,331
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I didn't rip anything off.

59
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:37,291
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you did a great job.

60
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:42,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you hurried through it or something, but... A little bit of trivia for those folks out there.

61
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:47,455
[SPEAKER_02]: LiveWire from the first episode was actually the second episode I did.

62
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I flipped them.

63
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:50,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.

64
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I liked one of them better than the other one.

65
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:54,477
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I liked it.

66
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:54,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was good.

67
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:05,666
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Saturday nights, Travis Donovan Live, Geek, Sci-Fi, Gaming, 360, you know, whatever's on his mind, trying to bring a little dose of reality to you kids.

68
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, Sunday nights, we're here.

69
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,468
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, enough plugs for the Sci-Projects.

70
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:11,649
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to welcome all of our new and old listeners.

71
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Those have been with us for...

72
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:14,888
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

73
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:15,549
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing?

74
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:16,169
[SPEAKER_03]: You made me play DDR.

75
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:16,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, it was fun.

76
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:17,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was.

77
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:17,949
[SPEAKER_03]: I played also some...

78
00:05:42,838 --> 00:06:11,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatmania 3 was it the 6th I think yeah 6th mix played some Cooking Mama played some Pinball we got our Whodunit back which is now Trading Potter and I joined Guild Wars this week I didn't really care for it the last time I tried it but I gave it a go this time around it's a lot more fun I don't know if I'm going to stick with it but I figure at the very least if

79
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,391
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay the money for it.

80
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just play it whenever I want and don't have to worry about anything.

81
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:17,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking about it.

82
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:20,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing with my friend Heather.

83
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

84
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,260
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

85
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,241
[SPEAKER_03]: More Cooking Mama.

86
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:25,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you beat Cooking Mama yet?

87
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:26,002
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

88
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:28,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I came this close to buying Cooking Mama, but I'm holding out for the Wii version.

89
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:30,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Get them both!

90
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Completion!

91
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And to make a rebuttal to Holy Shonen, I think you're wrong.

92
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,931
[SPEAKER_03]: What did Holy Shonen say?

93
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,371
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft is better than Guild Wars.

94
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:58,133
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft is just more annoying than Guild Wars.

95
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,314
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just kind of depends.

96
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:00,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

97
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:03,176
[SPEAKER_01]: They're almost exactly the same game.

98
00:07:03,316 --> 00:07:04,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see what the point is.

99
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:05,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

100
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:07,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be playing them both.

101
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:08,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand, because...

102
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:23,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Guild Wars you kind of level up to 20 and pretty much the entire game is endgame but World of Warcraft has a little more in the interim because you know you're going all the way to 60 there's a lot more to do in the interim I guess if you're addicted to leveling that's fine but I think that Guild Wars takes a little bit more skill to play I don't know

103
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:24,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

104
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,790
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very similar in game structure to me.

105
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

106
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really prefer one to the other.

107
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:33,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the fact that Guild Wars I can go to whenever I want for free, like once I've bought it.

108
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know that the game still has not dropped in price.

109
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:40,474
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get the old school Guild Wars, you have to pay the full $50 for it, which is interesting.

110
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:43,655
[SPEAKER_01]: But keep in mind, you say you're paying $9.99 a month for World of Warcraft, right?

111
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:44,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it like $12 or $14.95?

112
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:46,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even remember.

113
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:47,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's more like $12.

114
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Final Fantasy is $12.95 and WoW is like

115
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:57,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

116
00:07:57,716 --> 00:08:03,639
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to end up paying more in a year for World of Warcraft than you are going to pay for Guild Wars.

117
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:10,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I did feel like the WoW universe was way more expansive though.

118
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,001
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot more to see in WoW.

119
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:15,263
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fundamental difference between the two, here's the fundamental difference between the two.

120
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,566
[SPEAKER_03]: In Guild Wars, the entire game is what you would call an instance in WoW.

121
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's alluring to some people, the fact that they play with exactly who they want and that's it.

122
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,231
[SPEAKER_03]: GhostSquad is freaking fun as hell.

123
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:26,851
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

124
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:26,951
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

125
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, GS68.

126
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about Ghost Squad.

127
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,904
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gun game in the arcades.

128
00:08:58,385 --> 00:08:59,686
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is freaking hot.

129
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that game.

130
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played a good gun game in a while.

131
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:06,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played it in ages, but Dan and I went and we just freaking played through every mission and it was great.

132
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I want to play Time Crisis 4, somebody's on it.

133
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:09,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

134
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

135
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:13,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty good.

136
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Full of lots of stuff.

137
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:16,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play Season 3.

138
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:16,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

139
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:24,767
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I've played lots of Resistance and that game is far better than Gears of War.

140
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:31,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that game and actually it's very pretty and looking at Resistance

141
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:40,311
[SPEAKER_02]: makes you actually kind of question, hey, you know, maybe the PlayStation 3 actually does look better than the 360, and it really looks good.

142
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:46,593
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I found myself literally, you know, between gunfights, you know, standing there going, wow, this looks really good, you know.

143
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:50,275
[SPEAKER_03]: What a fucking change for the year 2007 on this program.

144
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:51,996
[SPEAKER_03]: You are gushing about Sony tonight.

145
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:53,396
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

146
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:54,217
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, hold on.

147
00:09:54,237 --> 00:09:54,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he drinking?

148
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:57,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Resistance is good, okay?

149
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:58,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't I tell you?

150
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,539
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is hot.

151
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

152
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:01,700
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the problem, though.

153
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:02,913
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it.

154
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that's all that's out there.

155
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:07,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, back up.

156
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a PS3?

157
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:09,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got a PS3.

158
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,696
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm the only OLR host without a PS3?

159
00:10:11,716 --> 00:10:13,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got mine.

160
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:17,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I got hooked up, okay, for the PlayStation 3.

161
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:20,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the only one without the cool new toys.

162
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:20,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

163
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,519
[SPEAKER_04]: God hates me.

164
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Rob.

165
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:22,659
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

166
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:23,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

167
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,641
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not part of the PSWe60 club, so...

168
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:30,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I heart my Wii 60, screw you!

169
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:50,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so, no, seriously though, it's fun, it really is fun, and I just, I like it so much better than Gears of War, and the fact, you know, there's so many different difficulties you can play it on, so if you really aren't, you know, hardcore into it and stuff, you can, you know, have a good time with it, so it's very good, I like it.

170
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:52,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer 7.

171
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:56,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I bought Ridge Racer 7 because Nelly actually wanted to play it.

172
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I've played it and it's exactly the same as Ridge Racer 6.

173
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:03,483
[SPEAKER_02]: It pretty much is.

174
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:07,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now you said earlier, though, that you felt Resistance was better than anything you'd see on the 360.

175
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So because Ridge Racer 7 and 6 are so similar, did you think that graphically the PlayStation 3 one was superior?

176
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember a while back...

177
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:16,051
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

178
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Because folks were comparing the two and saying the 360 version looked better.

179
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:21,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say the 360 version.

180
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I couldn't pick up the differences.

181
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:31,344
[SPEAKER_02]: The only difference I saw was when you hit your nitro instead of the screen kind of turning white on the edges, it did this weird blur thing.

182
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:33,026
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's about it.

183
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:38,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do like Ridge Racer 7 on how they have different ways you can customize your cars and stuff.

184
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:39,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

185
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:41,593
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

186
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:45,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Full Auto 2 was another one I picked up on that as well.

187
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:47,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a huge fan of Full Auto 1.

188
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:49,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I sold back this week.

189
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Full Auto 2 is okay.

190
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like the first game.

191
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:56,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really notice any changes.

192
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:03,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the graphics look a little different, but it's pretty much the first game all over again, so that's kind of cool.

193
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:06,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do some chatroom comments, because the chatroom's on fire tonight.

194
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:10,859
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of new people in chat, and I think they've got three weeks of comments just penting up here.

195
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:14,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike W. says, Rob was also the only OLR host without a 360 for a while.

196
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

197
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get a 360 until March.

198
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:23,583
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, though... You eBayed it, or Craigslisted it or something and paid way too much for one, and she got the hookup because Dan was working it.

199
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:25,344
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I wouldn't have bought a PS3.

200
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:30,068
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

201
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:48,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob says, Hey Rob, you're not missing anything with the Doorstop 3.

202
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there really isn't anything.

203
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:56,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, what I would want most out of it right now is the Blu-ray player and fucking Tekken Dark Resurrection.

204
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that looks pretty badass.

205
00:12:58,392 --> 00:13:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't downloaded that because it's in another country and I don't like fighting games that much, so it's not a big deal for me.

206
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:10,161
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tried Grip Shift and that blows ass and I would not recommend it at all.

207
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,541
[SPEAKER_02]: MotorStorm is fucking awesome.

208
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:13,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the demo from MotorStorm.

209
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:14,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not like MotorStorm at all.

210
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I love MotorStorm.

211
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:17,783
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't think it was slow?

212
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was slow.

213
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:19,343
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's good.

214
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:19,763
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.

215
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:20,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

216
00:13:20,043 --> 00:13:21,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just maybe the target I was at?

217
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:21,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

218
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:28,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded says, next week, Loki takes back everything he said about Macs because he received a Mac and gloats about it.

219
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Could this be the year of change for Loki?

220
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:33,466
[SPEAKER_02]: No, listen, if I got a free Mac, I'd be selling that shit back.

221
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:35,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd actually probably smash it with a hammer.

222
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:36,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Or give it to Nelly.

223
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,207
[SPEAKER_02]: She'd probably want it.

224
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:38,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, no.

225
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:38,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

226
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:42,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than... Mac fans, don't turn us off, because I heart Macs, and so does Jamie.

227
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:43,764
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just crazy.

228
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:44,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like them.

229
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know... We're building a PC.

230
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:52,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if anyone's seen the new pictures of the new VAIO, but... My God, Sony's copying Apple now.

231
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:53,827
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty bad.

232
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:56,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, back in the games, real quick.

233
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:00,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I played that Gran Turismo HD.

234
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,131
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks better than the one at E3, but not by much.

235
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:08,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank God it's free, because I sure as hell wouldn't buy that piece of shit.

236
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:10,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Gran Turismo, so that's just me.

237
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty, I guess, but I don't know.

238
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:30,821
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me, and this is what I've noticed with a lot of the games on there, it seems to me a lot of these racing games, because that's mainly what I've been playing, have the kind of okay foreground stuff, and they have this really high-res background image that's kind of plastered on there.

239
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:35,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've noticed that in some of the pictures of Gran Turismo HD and Motorstorm and stuff.

240
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:35,304
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just

241
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to doing that, but I've been too busy playing the story mode in it, and I love...

242
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with no achievements to unlock, this is amazing to me.

243
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:14,707
[SPEAKER_02]: See, the thing that's kind of cool about those, they sort of have an achievement system for that one game.

244
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:20,092
[SPEAKER_02]: You unlock these skill points, they call them, and it actually unlocks different things like costumes and stuff.

245
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:23,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in Excite Truck and Burnout, you get trophies.

246
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:24,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.

247
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:36,113
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's kind of neat, though, is when you play through the whole game, it unlocks more weapons, and you can go back and play through again, and then you can unlock harder difficulties and stuff, and you get more skins for multiplayer.

248
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to try out 40-player multiplayer online with that.

249
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:41,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be crazy.

250
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:44,797
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, is that it for Gaming Week?

251
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:46,498
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it.

252
00:15:46,918 --> 00:15:53,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and by the way, just real quick, real quick, PlayStation 3, their download thing, okay, fucking sucks.

253
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:54,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Balls, okay?

254
00:15:54,721 --> 00:16:00,447
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that it takes like an hour to download something and you can't do anything while it's downloading.

255
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,549
[SPEAKER_02]: That fucking sucks and they need to fix that.

256
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:04,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now I'm done.

257
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick comment on the PlayStation 3 from Jared Joe in chat.

258
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:09,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the potential of my PS3 so far.

259
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for it to unleash itself.

260
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Resistance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance and both of those games are fantastic.

261
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:16,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Genji.

262
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice I said I had Genji.

263
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:23,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a demo, but I haven't played it yet.

264
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:47,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't sold mine back yet, but that's because I like going in every now and then punching animals.

265
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:10,943
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just me.

266
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:26,850
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

267
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:50,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week, once a week, we play Quake.

268
00:17:50,824 --> 00:17:56,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And we decided to try and bring that back a little bit and be in touch, because now we live all over.

269
00:17:56,065 --> 00:18:01,107
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy Garrett is in town, but Bill's off in New York City, and Matt's all traveling around the world.

270
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of tried to connect through Xbox Live.

271
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So we played Halo this week.

272
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:06,108
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's really funny, well, Halo 2.

273
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:07,849
[SPEAKER_03]: We were playing Halo 2 online.

274
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,009
[SPEAKER_03]: We all suck at it, right?

275
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,290
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the fun part of it, is that when you're playing against other people who suck at Halo, it's pretty fun.

276
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,651
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's really funny about what happened during it is that

277
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:17,249
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

278
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:25,641
[SPEAKER_03]: and somebody that joined the game was GamerAndy over, you know, because he has a site, GamerAndy.com, right?

279
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:32,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was signing on to kind of say, I'm sorry, we weren't able to, because he was, he got an invite to the New Year's show, but just scheduling conflicts, he wasn't able to make it on.

280
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:35,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was coming on to say, you know, oh, sorry, I couldn't make it, we'll have to make up.

281
00:18:35,704 --> 00:18:38,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll definitely have him on the show at some other time, because he's a really cool guy.

282
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:42,727
[SPEAKER_03]: But, oh my God, he kicked all our asses so horribly at Halo.

283
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:46,288
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh, I'm not any good, I haven't played, you know, he's very humble.

284
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,489
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I haven't played in a year and a half, I suck at Halo.

285
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just wiped all of us.

286
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,110
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Matt's pretty good, so he was giving him some competition.

287
00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:04,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to buy Halo 2 because, you know, I have... I think it was fun when I played, you know, briefly a long time ago, but I really... I'm not that great at first-person shooters sometimes.

288
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:12,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when we're playing Call of Duty 3, all I'm basically... All we play now is rocket launchers, sniper rifles... Yeah, that's actually what we were playing was the rockets.

289
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:15,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And that game was kind of fun because that's easy to kill someone in rockets, so...

290
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:18,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but, yeah, just rockets and just sniper rifles.

291
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:21,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we form a clan for, like, I suck at Halo?

292
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:26,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I realize we have the OL Army, but there's actually good players in the OL Army.

293
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,652
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some people that are, like, level 21.

294
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we get, like, level 1 for life, Joe?

295
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:32,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I... Level 1 for life.

296
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:37,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck completely... I suck ass at Halo, so... When Halo 3 comes out, I'm scared.

297
00:19:37,658 --> 00:19:38,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seriously scared.

298
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:40,380
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just play, because I'll buy Halo 3.

299
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you go.

300
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:44,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting a Legendary Edition, so I have a helmet at my desk, but that's about it.

301
00:19:45,505 --> 00:20:10,636
[SPEAKER_03]: and then otherwise I haven't been playing a lot I mean the arcade of course DDR and stuff but otherwise I got 200 of 200 achievement points in New Rally X thank you very much which is sadly the first arcade game I've gotten all the achievement points on and I'm the only one on my friends list that has played the damn game and I know that because I'm the only one with a high score on the list and I have like 70 something friends on Xbox Live and not a damn other person has played the game except me

302
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:15,406
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

303
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,388
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason I bought it, I remember from my childhood, okay?

304
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:17,929
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't hate.

305
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:19,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Rally X and the good old days.

306
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:20,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you're an old man.

307
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:21,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

308
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:22,434
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

309
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:24,105
[SPEAKER_03]: D.M.N.

310
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:24,425
[SPEAKER_03]: from STFU

311
00:20:53,908 --> 00:21:20,500
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't forget all our other live programming on Orange Lounge Radio again and of course we wanted to say take a moment to thank again all of our New Year's Eve people we had on this week we hope to incorporate guests not just from like the gaming industry but like other gaming podcasts and people you see out there in the gaming media we're trying to think of ways to incorporate that on into 2007 because the New Year's episode seemed to be really well received and you guys seemed to dig that so definitely we'll do stuff more like that in the future it was cool good times

312
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, how about some gaming news?

313
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:23,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk some smack about some gaming news.

314
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off.

315
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:34,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently there's a small little convention going on called CES, Consumer Electronics Show, that I completely forgot about.

316
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh yeah, CES is going on.

317
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:41,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so I'm kind of starting that all off.

318
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:47,861
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some rumors coming out about a brand new version of the Xbox 360, now with HDMI.

319
00:21:50,364 --> 00:21:51,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Code name the Zephyr.

320
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently there's been shots floating around from Engadget.

321
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there was some video on there from Xbox Scene.

322
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:06,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely something that's probably going to be out there at some point.

323
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:10,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Although a lot of people are bitching saying, oh, what about the early adopters?

324
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:11,172
[SPEAKER_02]: You screwed all of them.

325
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm just like, I don't need HDMI.

326
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:15,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

327
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:16,877
[SPEAKER_02]: My TV doesn't have HDMI.

328
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo does this shit all the time, no one seems to mind.

329
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:20,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

330
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:34,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, the DS Lite, I mean, sure, my panties were ruffled a little bit at the fact that, you know, the DS Lite comes out not even like a year after the DS is already on shelves, and I bought the first printing of the DS, but what can you do?

331
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this thing is inevitable.

332
00:22:35,947 --> 00:22:38,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really, I mean, for me, it's not a big deal.

333
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:43,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess later on down the line, if I really had an issue with this, I can just

334
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess buy another one or something.

335
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:50,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know, my TV doesn't have HDMI, so it's no good for me.

336
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:57,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my TV does, but, you know, I go back and I think about how long I was like, I have to get a component cable for the Wii.

337
00:22:57,975 --> 00:22:59,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get a component cable.

338
00:22:59,476 --> 00:23:00,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to have like the best video ever.

339
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it really wasn't that big a difference.

340
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:08,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think like, is it really going to be a deal breaker that I can't, I don't get HDMI right away?

341
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:13,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, chances are my 360 will break eventually anyway and I have to get a new one because

342
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'll just wait for that inevitability.

343
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

344
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:23,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people are saying also that the new 360 is going to... And I don't even know where they're pulling this info from.

345
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:27,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because I believe the HDMI part because, you know, we've seen pictures of it.

346
00:23:27,725 --> 00:23:30,647
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're saying, oh, it's going to have a 120 gig hard drive and all this stuff.

347
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:38,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's going to have the 65 nanometer chipsets in there and stuff.

348
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:41,652
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, really...

349
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:45,175
[SPEAKER_02]: The 120GB hard drive will be something that they add on later.

350
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:48,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's something that they'll have the offer that you can buy.

351
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:51,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be probably included with this.

352
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

353
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,039
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, all I think they're going to do is add this HDMI port.

354
00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:00,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be a brand new model of the 360.

355
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be, now the 360s are coming out with HDMI ports on them.

356
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,401
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it.

357
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:11,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll have the cooler processor in there, so lower the cost of the system, but

358
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're going to do anything above and beyond this.

359
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,571
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Dollar Bill says, HDMI don't care

360
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:09,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let's see, we have, um, I believe it was Paradox Vincent said, uh, DS Fat sucks!

361
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:16,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, NM64 says, uh, DS Lite is only worth it if you need a new DS or never had one.

362
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So some conflicting opinions there.

363
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:18,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Fat is fine.

364
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know the DS Fat is actually louder than the DS Lite?

365
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:25,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is good for games like Elite Beat Agents and stuff when you need to, you know, drown other people out.

366
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:26,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

367
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:28,095
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

368
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,154
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the top-loading one that looked like a Famicom later on.

369
00:25:57,275 --> 00:26:05,561
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, with, well, I guess not really the Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo, but the 64, they added Rumble later on.

370
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you could add the RAM pack later on.

371
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:08,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and they had the Pokemon 64.

372
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:11,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly, the Pokemon 64.

373
00:26:11,626 --> 00:26:14,028
[SPEAKER_02]: They always tried to pull this shit.

374
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:21,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't think that they don't know that later on, you know, people are going to buy an extra DS because it's in a specific color.

375
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:22,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, it doesn't,

376
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that hard to manufacture the DS in a different color.

377
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, ooh, I just thought though, Microsoft does that too.

378
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:29,251
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done it before.

379
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:30,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what kind of Xbox I have?

380
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:33,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the same Xbox most people have.

381
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:35,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a Halo Xbox that's the see-through green.

382
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:37,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Halo Xbox that's the see-through green.

383
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but most people don't have that.

384
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people have the big black brick, right?

385
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:42,854
[SPEAKER_01]: My big black brick died.

386
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:45,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft is not beyond redesigning their consoles.

387
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:45,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

388
00:26:46,994 --> 00:26:49,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think there will be a Halo 3 limited edition console?

389
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:51,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it'll just be a faceplate?

390
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega did it too, back with the Sega Support Streamcast.

391
00:26:55,124 --> 00:26:56,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the faceplates are what they're doing now.

392
00:26:56,924 --> 00:26:57,685
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big thing.

393
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,726
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wouldn't be surprised if we see a black console later.

394
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:03,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's something that's very possible.

395
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:05,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

396
00:27:05,828 --> 00:27:07,368
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know the Wii colors are coming.

397
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:08,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of time.

398
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:08,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

399
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are coming.

400
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the PlayStation 3 colors.

401
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,530
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see those as well.

402
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

403
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not... I mean, look at the PlayStation 2.

404
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:18,652
[SPEAKER_02]: They have silver, pink.

405
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:19,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

406
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:20,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

407
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:21,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody does it.

408
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:23,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I need something to match my cabinet that I got at Ikea.

409
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:28,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh my god, I gotta totally get a pink one for my girlfriend because she's going to totally appreciate it.

410
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you give it to her, she's like, wow, this is so pretty.

411
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,773
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck am I going to play on it?

412
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:39,559
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people, you know why they keep doing this, you guys?

413
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:43,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because people are retarded and they will buy this shit.

414
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,565
[SPEAKER_02]: They will buy a blue DS when it comes out because it's blue.

415
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:48,987
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll buy a pink DS when it comes out because it's pink.

416
00:27:49,892 --> 00:28:02,520
[SPEAKER_02]: because people are retarded and they don't understand there's websites out there that make custom color DSs that you can order brand new in any fucking color of the rainbow that you want instead of having to wait for Nintendo to put it out.

417
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:07,904
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a conversation going on in chat right now that has me thinking a little bit.

418
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:12,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think the black Wii will be a little bit bigger than the white Wii?

419
00:28:13,807 --> 00:28:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and the yellow Wii is going to be super tiny.

420
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:17,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

421
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:23,020
[SPEAKER_03]: You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeLawnsRadio.com Hey, you started it, okay?

422
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just move right along to talking about Halo 3.

423
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:29,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we were talking about that a little bit.

424
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beta testing, right?

425
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:34,666
[SPEAKER_03]: You had everybody slam that site trying to get into the beta test.

426
00:28:34,706 --> 00:28:36,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll find out this month if you got into the beta test.

427
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:41,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you didn't get in that way, there is the Rule of Three.

428
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:53,311
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't know why else you would call it that unless you want people to say the rule of three, the mysterious rule of three to get into the Halo 3 beta test.

429
00:28:54,191 --> 00:29:12,057
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to happen is that if you play three hours worth of Halo 2 multiplayer between Thursday the 1st of February and February 3rd, 2007, if you're among one of the first 13,333 to register at Halo3.com right after that, then you will be part of the Halo 3 beta.

430
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:14,628
[SPEAKER_03]: The other way to get into it, buy Crackdown.

431
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:43,660
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool when it was like a beta thing and you didn't know how many people were going to get into it and you thought, oh, hey, this is going to be only a couple thousand.

432
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

433
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,501
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in the cool club now.

434
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:50,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're, oh, anyone that buys this game will get into the beta.

435
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:52,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and this is another way to get into the beta.

436
00:29:53,202 --> 00:29:59,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the fuck is a beta test like fucking incentive to buy something or do something?

437
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:03,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're beta testing something and you don't realize that's actually work.

438
00:30:04,448 --> 00:30:05,468
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

439
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:41,882
[SPEAKER_03]: People will be on their consoles one minute after, play the three hours back to back to back, and then be on Halo 3 immediately.

440
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,122
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be 13,333 people to do that.

441
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:46,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know why Microsoft bothered to make such a big window.

442
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:47,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

443
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:51,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to buy Crackdown and play Crackdown.

444
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:57,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you right now, if you want to get in that way, if you're not on there at midnight ready to play until 3 a.m., forget it.

445
00:30:57,886 --> 00:30:58,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Write it off.

446
00:30:58,306 --> 00:30:58,886
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not getting in.

447
00:30:59,866 --> 00:31:00,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

448
00:31:00,866 --> 00:31:02,047
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that's how it's going to work.

449
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:03,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it.

450
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,676
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people who got to play it anyway.

451
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh really?

452
00:31:08,417 --> 00:31:08,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

453
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:09,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh really?

454
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:09,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

455
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:10,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

456
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:11,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's beat them up.

457
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:12,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Take their lunch money.

458
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they could actually beat any one of us.

459
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:16,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?

460
00:31:17,423 --> 00:31:22,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Bungie actually flew over copies of the beta to the troops overseas.

461
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:24,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, they probably could get my SCM.

462
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably could.

463
00:31:25,247 --> 00:31:26,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

464
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:27,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts.

465
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically let them have the free demo for Christmas.

466
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:31,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a try.

467
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:33,546
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that's pretty cool.

468
00:31:33,706 --> 00:31:34,467
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of neat.

469
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,569
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something kind of different.

470
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:38,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a very interesting way.

471
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:44,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And I bet you a lot of our troops are kind of into Halo 2 and 3 and all that stuff.

472
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:45,957
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's kind of cool.

473
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:50,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good way, I think, to relieve some of the stress of having to be there.

474
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:51,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a really good thing.

475
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:53,584
[SPEAKER_01]: That's neat.

476
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:54,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Bungie.

477
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:59,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so more stuff for the 360.

478
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:08,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how they always have themes and stuff on Xbox Live and they're so wonderful how they don't show you what they look like before you buy them.

479
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:22,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thankfully there is a website now that will show you what they look like called DashboardThemes.com and you can go there before you buy a theme and check out what it looks like and possibly save your Xbox Live points.

480
00:32:23,019 --> 00:32:29,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I would just save your Xbox Live points or the other thing you can do if you have a memory unit

481
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:30,304
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

482
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:46,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, from what I remember reading on this site, the people were putting it together with their own money.

483
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:58,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they do deserve some type of, you know, medallion or recognition from the community for putting together that public service because for whatever reason, Microsoft isn't on top of it with their previews.

484
00:32:58,617 --> 00:33:03,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can preview some stuff on Xbox.com to be fair, but they're not very current.

485
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys, you know, they have it the day it comes out.

486
00:33:06,101 --> 00:33:09,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think they deserve a round of applause from the gaming community.

487
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:10,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

488
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:12,342
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

489
00:33:13,383 --> 00:33:15,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, other surprises that you might find.

490
00:33:16,947 --> 00:33:33,724
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting is that this 14-year-old boy who lives in Utah claims that he purchased a factory-sealed copy of Madden 07 for the Xbox 360, and he put the disc in his system, and up came, not John Madden, but hardcore pornography.

491
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,006
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a roster update.

492
00:33:35,757 --> 00:33:42,100
[SPEAKER_03]: The boy immediately notified his parents and they're backing up the claim and said this is legit.

493
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:51,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Electronic Arts was contacted and they're working with the store that the game was bought from to see if maybe something funny went on here.

494
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:54,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe a disgruntled employee put some porn in there.

495
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:58,626
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because how easy would it be to print out a Madden label like on your computer?

496
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,800
[SPEAKER_03]: and then take a porn disc and put it on there?

497
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little harder because those are actually silk-screened onto the discs.

498
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:14,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but if you're 14 and you don't know to look for that kind of stuff, I mean, don't you think someone could get away with that?

499
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,447
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to be pretty retarded.

500
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Although he does look pretty retarded.

501
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:19,228
[SPEAKER_02]: You're nice.

502
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:26,131
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have to be pretty retarded if you're a 14-year-old boy and you get porn and go tell your parents.

503
00:34:27,977 --> 00:34:28,877
I'm playing Madden.

504
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:29,337
Go away!

505
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:30,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the door shut.

506
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:31,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing Madden.

507
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Inviting all your friends over to play Madden.

508
00:34:34,558 --> 00:34:36,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Building a shrine to the Madden disc in your bedroom.

509
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:37,899
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.

510
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,180
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see the coolest copy of Madden you've ever seen.

511
00:34:58,368 --> 00:35:02,631
[SPEAKER_03]: EA would, quote, regrets any embarrassment the matter has caused the family.

512
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:07,034
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a way to learn a lesson early.

513
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:09,295
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, one other quote that's great here.

514
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:18,781
[SPEAKER_03]: According to a paper in Utah, the Standard Examiner, when Mahoney looked at the pornographic images, his first thought was, quote, this is definitely not Madden.

515
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,723
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's NHL 2000.

516
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:26,864
[SPEAKER_01]: on Dreamcast.

517
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:53,256
[SPEAKER_03]: JeremyTodd1 says, Loki, wouldn't you rather sue the game company and get millions rather than keep some porn you can find for free?

518
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,200
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin1 said, I found porn on my PSP memory card from EB, I told nobody

519
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it a used game or a new one?

520
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:10,069
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a used... Oh, that game?

521
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:11,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a new factory-sealed game.

522
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,851
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fun.

523
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:18,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says he notified his parents, quote, under long review, this is porn.

524
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:22,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, hold on, we have to go review... Gotta go to the bathroom.

525
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:28,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of something that has nothing to do with porn... Okay.

526
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:30,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it might have been, but that's not official.

527
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:33,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess who's leaving Rare for more porn?

528
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:35,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for not porn.

529
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:37,012
[SPEAKER_03]: The pinatas?

530
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:41,319
[SPEAKER_01]: The Stamper Brothers are leaving Rare.

531
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:42,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, didn't they like found it or something?

532
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:43,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

533
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:49,352
[SPEAKER_01]: They were one of the, well, I guess two of the main folks behind Rare and now they're gone.

534
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:49,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.

535
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:54,788
[SPEAKER_01]: They've gone to, uh, quote, uh, pursue other opportunities.

536
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:56,449
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, they're all, fuck this shit!

537
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,891
[SPEAKER_02]: We ain't making no more fucking pinata games!

538
00:36:59,231 --> 00:37:00,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck this, we want Killer Instinct!

539
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:02,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, wait, wait a damn minute, though.

540
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:05,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Viva Pinata was the best thing Rare's put out in a while, sadly.

541
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:06,718
[SPEAKER_01]: They did put out, didn't they?

542
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn.

543
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:14,332
[SPEAKER_02]: We promise, just make the pinata game and we'll let you make Killer Instinct.

544
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:18,032
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to know is, Viva Pinata was not that bad.

545
00:37:18,092 --> 00:37:19,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's actually quite good.

546
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasant surprise of a game, so don't knock it until you've tried it.

547
00:37:23,093 --> 00:37:23,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty fun game.

548
00:37:24,393 --> 00:37:28,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I had way more fun with Viva Pinata than Cameo and Perfect Dark Zero combined.

549
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:29,114
[SPEAKER_03]: End of story.

550
00:37:29,354 --> 00:37:29,814
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

551
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, Perfect Dark Zero is like balls.

552
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:38,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So if that's why, yeah, I know, and I'm like, if that's why they left was over Viva Pinata, then bye, don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.

553
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,796
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I...

554
00:37:41,048 --> 00:37:50,694
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to know was, did they leave this voluntarily, or is this one of those nice ways of saying they were asked to leave because the community was not too receptive to some of the recent games?

555
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't believe Viva Pinata is performing very well.

556
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:55,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's reaching the target audience.

557
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, critically, it's doing well, but that doesn't always translate to money.

558
00:37:58,378 --> 00:37:58,838
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

559
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:05,722
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually an interview, but I have to look a little bit more further into that, but I think it's willing.

560
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:07,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

561
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:08,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they'll start a rival company?

562
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:10,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

563
00:38:12,122 --> 00:38:14,425
[SPEAKER_01]: They should make one called Uncommon.

564
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,210
[SPEAKER_03]: WonderDogHerald says... Oh, I get it.

565
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,853
[SPEAKER_03]: WonderDogHerald says they're just taking the money and running.

566
00:38:23,977 --> 00:38:26,580
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Morpheus says thanks to Viva I can't play my 360 right now.

567
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:33,734
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's because I've seen his woman on there playing Viva Pinata non-stop because she's on my friends list.

568
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:38,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be looking at my Xbox friends list at 1 in the afternoon and look who's online playing Viva Pinata.

569
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:44,942
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what would be hilarious is if you smack that woman enough times that she like locked up your system for like an hour or something like that.

570
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:45,463
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

571
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:49,165
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I said that'd be funny if that happened, you know, in the game where you smack her.

572
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:52,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you meant Travis's woman.

573
00:38:52,648 --> 00:38:53,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's not nice.

574
00:38:55,285 --> 00:38:55,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Catamari

575
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Although what does suck ass is the fact that it's not coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

576
00:39:29,193 --> 00:39:46,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently that was a rumor that was going around, but of course diffused by the worldwide Xbox Live Arcade games portfolio manager, Ross Erickson, who basically said that the rumor is total crap and is not happening.

577
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,869
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

578
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:52,118
[SPEAKER_02]: No Katamari.

579
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:55,961
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm sure we'll see Katamari come to the 360 some point.

580
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:56,902
[SPEAKER_02]: You think?

581
00:39:57,102 --> 00:39:57,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

582
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:58,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

583
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:00,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco likes remaking stuff.

584
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:02,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Rage Racer.

585
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:03,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

586
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know yet about what the future has in store for Katamari.

587
00:40:08,912 --> 00:40:10,493
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be more Katamari games.

588
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:12,515
[SPEAKER_02]: They registered trademarks already for them.

589
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:16,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're going to do some fucking Katamari cartoon, which would be even more cool.

590
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:18,620
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

591
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:20,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

592
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:24,217
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have some other interesting rumors going around.

593
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:26,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Katamari thing started as a rumor.

594
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:35,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now they're saying that Radiant Silvergun 3, there was a report earlier this week, that Radiant Silvergun 3 was going to be on the Xbox 360.

595
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:39,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Knights is going to be coming to the Wii.

596
00:40:39,988 --> 00:40:41,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be very interesting.

597
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:43,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Knights on the Wii would be fun.

598
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the Radiant Silvergun 3 did get basically...

599
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:49,671
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have Ikaruga.

600
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:17,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still thinking about getting that Dreamcast one that's coming out.

601
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it New Hope or something like that?

602
00:41:43,888 --> 00:41:45,748
[SPEAKER_03]: My Dreamcast is in a box, sadly.

603
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:49,529
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have ours in an Xbox kiosk.

604
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,090
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those little demo stations, the old ones.

605
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,750
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have our Dreamcast sitting in one.

606
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to your demo station you had?

607
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:56,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen it.

608
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:56,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

609
00:41:57,871 --> 00:41:58,952
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do those things sell for?

610
00:41:59,332 --> 00:42:00,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what we got for it.

611
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:01,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

612
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:01,932
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

613
00:42:01,992 --> 00:42:02,472
[SPEAKER_03]: How much, Loki?

614
00:42:03,233 --> 00:42:04,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Like $500, if not more.

615
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you looking at that on eBay or something?

616
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:07,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was for a customer.

617
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:08,754
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to bring it.

618
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:37,428
[SPEAKER_02]: you know those things are so hard to get like for even like Microsoft for example in order to get a kiosk into your store you have to be buying lots of Microsoft product and then you get the privilege of buying one from them for like a couple grand it's like thank you for giving me the privilege to buy one from you you fucking douche but I'm trying to push your product you know and you don't want to give me a kiosk or sell me a kiosk I don't understand it but whatever well

619
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:39,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess we don't know.

620
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:10,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of one of those things where it's like it's happening, but we're not going to tell you anything else.

621
00:43:11,418 --> 00:43:23,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're saying that they might do a... There's a rumor, at least, that there's going to be a smaller one, either for PC or something on Xbox Live Arcade, but... I mean, like, PC is MMO home, though.

622
00:43:24,364 --> 00:43:32,128
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a little silly to not put it out on the PC, especially, you know, when the Xbox 360 is a PC, according to, you know, something I read just before we went live tonight.

623
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:34,249
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, according to what Bill Gates, the Xbox 360 is a PC.

624
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:34,309
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

625
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,060
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

626
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:06,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Being that we put this show out on Sundays, some of the stuff has come out during the week.

627
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:11,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of those were brand new Ubisoft games, whoop-de-doo.

628
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, hold on.

629
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:17,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say before you start getting this stuff out, we have to get a little disclaimer about sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong.

630
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:18,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

631
00:44:19,174 --> 00:44:20,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen.

632
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:21,516
[SPEAKER_03]: New year, new show.

633
00:44:21,996 --> 00:44:24,018
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes these dates are right and sometimes they're wrong.

634
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:24,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they wrong sometimes?

635
00:44:25,138 --> 00:44:28,901
[SPEAKER_02]: They're wrong sometimes because they change dates daily.

636
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:31,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So stuff changes all the time.

637
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:35,967
[SPEAKER_02]: and a company to announce a date initially and have that date stick.

638
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:37,459
[SPEAKER_02]: is like a rarity.

639
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:38,739
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff shuffles around.

640
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:50,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only reason it shuffles around is development cycles, whether they're in behind or ahead in development or getting approval from like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.

641
00:44:50,427 --> 00:44:59,132
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, just to kind of give an example, this week, or actually I should say a long time ago, I want to say it was in like episode 195 or something.

642
00:44:59,152 --> 00:45:01,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a while ago, a long time ago, about six months ago.

643
00:45:01,594 --> 00:45:05,456
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that Bioshock was coming out in April of 2007.

644
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:05,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

645
00:45:06,597 --> 00:45:12,740
[SPEAKER_03]: But then this week we heard that there was a 2K Games rep that was posting on some forum that said, it's coming out in June, you heard it here first.

646
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like, you were in the right ballpark, but for whatever reason these developers... No, they changed it.

647
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:25,005
[SPEAKER_02]: The same day... Well, actually, I think... Because I don't pay attention to some of these date changes or don't bother repeating them again.

648
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:30,428
[SPEAKER_02]: But before the guy came out and said, oh yeah, by the way, this is... We had a date change to...

649
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:32,344
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

650
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:49,580
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

651
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:11,713
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew about Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 six months before anybody ever announced it officially.

652
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:14,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever these titles drop in, it's always right.

653
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:15,194
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've noticed.

654
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:16,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And Oblivion on PSP.

655
00:46:16,455 --> 00:46:16,815
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

656
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:17,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that from last year.

657
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:19,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And Full Auto 2 on PSP.

658
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:24,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there anything in this list that's new that we don't know about yet?

659
00:46:24,277 --> 00:46:24,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes.

660
00:46:25,117 --> 00:46:25,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have stuff.

661
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:35,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, first off, we mentioned it last week, Driver Parallel Lines for the PSP, which was actually March 14th was when that was coming out.

662
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's being changed to Driver 76.

663
00:46:38,682 --> 00:46:44,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you remember, Driver Parallel Alliance started off in 1976 and then it comes in the modern time.

664
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:48,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm guessing this game is going to be Driver Parallel Alliance, but just set in 1976.

665
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that because the Driver series sucks.

666
00:46:52,313 --> 00:46:54,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.

667
00:46:54,054 --> 00:46:55,515
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just happening.

668
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,417
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, I do have a date for you.

669
00:46:57,437 --> 00:46:58,277
[SPEAKER_02]: This will make you happy.

670
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:02,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3, March 14th as well.

671
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:05,523
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that was coming.

672
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely one that, you know, not a big surprise, but we don't have a date for that yet, so that's kind of cool.

673
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,147
[SPEAKER_02]: New games, though, that haven't been announced.

674
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:18,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Dream Pinball 3D for the Wii, coming out October 10th, so still ways off.

675
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:25,196
[SPEAKER_02]: And not a huge surprise, but Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii.

676
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:27,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Movie time, mandatory movie time.

677
00:47:27,437 --> 00:47:28,678
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2, not 3.

678
00:47:29,619 --> 00:47:30,040
[SPEAKER_02]: PS2.

679
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of stuff being developed for PlayStation 3.

680
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:35,364
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, though, lots of stuff.

681
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:36,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

682
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, by the way, those two Ubisoft games, uh, Cosmic Family and Spelling Spree.

683
00:47:42,103 --> 00:47:44,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Cosmic Family, I hear, is meant for really little kids.

684
00:47:45,426 --> 00:47:47,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I guess it's based off a cartoon series or something like that.

685
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:53,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Spelling Spree, um, I'm guessing some sort of, like, DS type of game.

686
00:47:54,172 --> 00:48:00,416
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me think, like, imagine people driving by in their cars, rolling down the window, and, like, spelling at them to death.

687
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:03,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well...

688
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,091
[SPEAKER_01]: P-R-I-Z-E, die!

689
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:12,114
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, we mentioned last week, and I haven't seen this anywhere yet, but Driver Parallel Alliance is on the Wii.

690
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:14,195
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the ones that they didn't mention.

691
00:48:14,636 --> 00:48:17,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I really care to play that on the Wii, but I'm just saying, you know.

692
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:19,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Letting it be known.

693
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:20,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

694
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:22,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So you heard it here first.

695
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:23,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.

696
00:48:25,021 --> 00:48:25,402
[SPEAKER_02]: We think.

697
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:29,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I can't check the whole internet, but as far as I'm aware, none of the

698
00:48:30,111 --> 00:48:30,631
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

699
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,491
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 2, Arthur, The Shield, New Yu-Gi-Oh!

700
00:49:24,992 --> 00:49:26,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Japanese release dates.

701
00:49:26,794 --> 00:49:28,796
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a couple big titles coming out.

702
00:49:28,956 --> 00:49:33,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Atsumare Pinata is coming out January 11, 2007 on 360.

703
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:36,364
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the name of Viva Pinata, localized for Japan.

704
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:40,269
[SPEAKER_03]: For the PlayStation 3, you get NBA 07 over there.

705
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:40,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

706
00:49:41,837 --> 00:49:42,317
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

707
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:02,889
[SPEAKER_03]: GT Pro Series coming out for the Nintendo Wii.

708
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend you pass on that one.

709
00:50:05,612 --> 00:50:08,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on January 11th for the PlayStation 2.

710
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:10,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of new stuff.

711
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:21,444
[SPEAKER_03]: You do get a couple things going into the best series from Koei, including Warship Gunner 2 and Shin Sangoku Musou 3 Empires and Mushoden.

712
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I should note, though, that .hack//G.U.

713
00:50:24,787 --> 00:50:28,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Volume 3 is out next week, so I know a lot of folks are really into .hack//G.U.

714
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,171
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on its way out pretty soon.

715
00:50:31,272 --> 00:50:46,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Zetai Onkan Training DS and DS Dengeki Bunko, Ira no Sora, UFO no Natsu is coming out this week, January 11th.

716
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,744
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course... That's funny.

717
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:48,345
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

718
00:50:49,806 --> 00:50:52,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess UFO of Summer?

719
00:50:52,932 --> 00:50:59,076
[SPEAKER_03]: DS Dengeki Bunko Ira no Sora UFO no Natsu Huh That's what it's called Okay But probably most people holding out for Oh, never mind, it's a US release, never mind

720
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:25,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

721
00:51:25,997 --> 00:51:27,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Are any of you really going to import it?

722
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:27,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't think so.

723
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:28,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I will.

724
00:51:29,622 --> 00:51:30,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm planning on getting it.

725
00:51:30,624 --> 00:51:32,967
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that other game that's not coming out?

726
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:34,730
[SPEAKER_01]: That one that we played for DDR?

727
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:36,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to import that.

728
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:38,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

729
00:51:38,636 --> 00:51:38,796
[SPEAKER_03]: The

730
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:40,435
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the intro.

731
00:51:40,615 --> 00:51:41,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh, Oz.

732
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:42,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

733
00:51:42,496 --> 00:51:43,176
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an old game.

734
00:51:43,336 --> 00:51:44,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's old, but I think I'm going to get it.

735
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:49,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we played the Oz song, the Plovastian dance and chorus.

736
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:51,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We played that today, and Jamie was like, I want that game.

737
00:51:52,218 --> 00:51:58,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading from that title, I think it's Ida of Sky something, summer, whatever.

738
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we have our UK release dates, if anyone's interested, which I am.

739
00:52:06,278 --> 00:52:08,380
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 12th is pretty much what's coming out.

740
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:23,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Bionicle Heroes, Children of Mana, both on DS, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition on Xbox 360, Tokobot Plus, Mysteries of the Karakuri on PS2, and WarioWare Smooth Moves on Wii.

741
00:52:25,853 --> 00:52:27,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't wait for WarioWare to come out next.

742
00:52:27,955 --> 00:52:30,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's next week.

743
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:31,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

744
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:32,559
[SPEAKER_02]: New game!

745
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:34,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally.

746
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

747
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:46,395
[SPEAKER_02]: One new game, though, that we're probably not going to see, at least I hope to God we're not going to see this, is a new RPG based on Tingle, that really annoying gay fairy from Wind Waker.

748
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:47,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, he hasn't come out yet.

749
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:49,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people assuming.

750
00:52:49,377 --> 00:52:55,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, flaming gay fairy from Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.

751
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that there's anything wrong with that, Loki.

752
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wrong with that.

753
00:52:58,361 --> 00:53:00,542
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just super homo flaming gay.

754
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:03,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so apparently it's...

755
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:07,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, it's possibly going to head to the US in 2017.

756
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:12,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, there is no freaking way this game is not coming to the US at this point.

757
00:53:12,978 --> 00:53:16,339
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going out of their way to put it out in Europe, you know it's coming here.

758
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's coming, because the English version will already exist.

759
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:20,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to come here.

760
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:20,842
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Mother 3?

761
00:53:20,882 --> 00:53:24,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't that come out in the... I don't think it did come out over there.

762
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:30,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out in Japan, of course, but... I thought there was one game that got translated for the UK, but never came out over here.

763
00:53:30,347 --> 00:53:32,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm telling you, it's not going to be Tingle RPG.

764
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:32,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't.

765
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,901
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Mother 3.

766
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:38,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Not with the freaking petition going on and everything.

767
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people out there that want their Tingle.

768
00:53:41,703 --> 00:53:42,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Tingle.

769
00:53:44,064 --> 00:53:45,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You know you're going to want this game, Loki.

770
00:53:45,344 --> 00:53:47,425
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to buy it.

771
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:48,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Nellie's going to make you buy it.

772
00:53:48,485 --> 00:53:50,066
[SPEAKER_03]: She will not make me buy this stuff.

773
00:53:50,106 --> 00:53:51,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I will show it to her and then she'll make you buy it.

774
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:55,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to play the Tingle RPG.

775
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:55,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

776
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:57,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, will you play the Tingle RPG?

777
00:53:58,348 --> 00:53:58,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

778
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:00,349
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm out of school.

779
00:54:01,623 --> 00:54:04,724
[SPEAKER_03]: NM64 would like to point out, Loki, Tingle was in Majora's Mask.

780
00:54:06,784 --> 00:54:11,345
[SPEAKER_03]: JeremyTodd1 says, fact, Rob tried to try out for the role of Tingle, but Nintendo rejected him.

781
00:54:11,906 --> 00:54:12,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, sad.

782
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:16,907
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, you know, it's true, though, that I do have this secret desire.

783
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:18,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always wanted to be a voice actor in a game.

784
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:19,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be fun.

785
00:54:19,587 --> 00:54:20,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a lot of fun, don't you?

786
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,148
[SPEAKER_02]: A voice actor in a game?

787
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:23,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?

788
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:25,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not Tingle, God no, but, you know, something.

789
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:29,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could be a soldier that gets shot in Halo 3 or something.

790
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:29,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

791
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:32,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the hell you're doing there.

792
00:54:32,533 --> 00:54:33,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Tingle!

793
00:54:35,133 --> 00:54:37,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, Loki!

794
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:38,835
[SPEAKER_02]: You should do it!

795
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna be Tingle.

796
00:54:44,236 --> 00:54:48,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I want someone to create a petition right now on that site, whatever that petition site is.

797
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:50,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki for Tingle!

798
00:54:50,778 --> 00:54:52,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Tingle have a hag in that game?

799
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:53,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

800
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:54,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

801
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy god!

802
00:54:58,121 --> 00:54:58,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you!

803
00:54:59,617 --> 00:55:02,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Insider Information says, Thank God it's not coming.

804
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Shonen says, Tingle funny, but I want him dead.

805
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he'd sell well over here.

806
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:10,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Too annoying.

807
00:55:11,772 --> 00:55:14,395
[SPEAKER_02]: People will say, fuck this Tingle shit, we want more Zelda.

808
00:55:14,796 --> 00:55:18,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something else that won't come out over here is new music games for the PSP.

809
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:19,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, huh?

810
00:55:20,323 --> 00:55:29,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Sony is denying that a frequency sequel and a new music game called Traxian for the PSP were not...

811
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:37,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Denied by them, but apparently Harmonix spoke to IGN recently, and the team behind Frequency said, this is what Sony did.

812
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:42,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony denied Traxian and the Frequency sequel for the PSP.

813
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Traxian was killed months ago.

814
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:47,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Months ago that thing was gone.

815
00:55:47,382 --> 00:55:50,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Harmonix proposed the sequel on the handheld, but Sony said no.

816
00:55:51,123 --> 00:55:53,984
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of that, LucasArts was going to bring that game Traxian.

817
00:55:54,004 --> 00:55:56,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it was LucasArts, not Harmonix, bringing Traxian.

818
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was also axed.

819
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:05,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I know for a fact Sony likes to pass on games they should not be passing on.

820
00:56:06,294 --> 00:56:16,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shocked that they would... With all the furor that Red Octane is causing right now with Guitar Hero and everything, I...

821
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:21,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shocked that they would deny them to make a music game on the PSP.

822
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you have freaking Taiko no Tatsujin, which is a stupid game.

823
00:56:26,103 --> 00:56:29,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand Sony's logic with the games they're not allowing through.

824
00:56:30,205 --> 00:56:31,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make sense to me at all.

825
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:33,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad move, Sony.

826
00:56:34,187 --> 00:56:41,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, do this enough times to Harmonix, and Microsoft, who's going to probably be a little more welcoming, hey, you want to develop for us?

827
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:42,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great, we want games on the console.

828
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:44,533
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, that's where that game's going to end up.

829
00:56:44,553 --> 00:56:45,034
[SPEAKER_02]: What about...

830
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,129
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

831
00:57:07,646 --> 00:57:10,248
[SPEAKER_01]: The rumor now is for Tekken 6 on Xbox 360.

832
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:22,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the same person, quote, IGN Insider, who was also credited for letting the news out for Virtua Fighter 5.

833
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's out, it's not like it hasn't been done before that's come out on a non-Sony system.

834
00:57:29,284 --> 00:57:33,007
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the Game Boy Advance one.

835
00:57:33,427 --> 00:57:34,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Tekken Advance?

836
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:36,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I try not to.

837
00:57:37,293 --> 00:57:40,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually own that game, and I thought it was okay.

838
00:57:41,476 --> 00:57:43,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got the Bleemcast Tekken 3.

839
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:45,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

840
00:57:46,979 --> 00:57:48,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

841
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,483
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you think, being a Tekken fangirl that you are, what would you think about this coming to the 360?

842
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,041
[SPEAKER_03]: is that good news, bad news?

843
00:57:56,302 --> 00:58:00,145
[SPEAKER_03]: I do always kind of put Tekken with Sony.

844
00:58:00,705 --> 00:58:05,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about Sony's version of Soul Calibur 2 had Heihachi as the bonus character.

845
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:06,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken's always been a very Sony thing.

846
00:58:07,411 --> 00:58:10,814
[SPEAKER_03]: The timing and everything of this seems a little fanboy to me.

847
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:16,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is just the negative Sony ball keeps on rolling and people are saying this.

848
00:58:16,098 --> 00:58:16,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this is legit.

849
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:21,763
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also them saying, you remember Soul Calibur for the longest time was a Sony exclusive.

850
00:58:22,944 --> 00:58:31,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet we had three releases of Soul Calibur 2 on various systems, each with their own bonus character.

851
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:35,916
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say yay or nay, but I don't think it's far-fetched.

852
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:42,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just there's not a lot, even though despite what Sony says, oh, we're meeting our numbers.

853
00:58:42,942 --> 00:58:45,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're lower numbers that they keep saying.

854
00:58:46,075 --> 00:58:46,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

855
00:59:16,215 --> 00:59:25,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to get your Tekken fix on the PlayStation 3 right now, you can definitely if you're in Japan because Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection is out there.

856
00:59:26,098 --> 00:59:28,359
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in another region, fear not.

857
00:59:28,479 --> 00:59:33,861
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a workaround just like they have for the Xbox 360 for their demos.

858
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,361
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually do this.

859
00:59:35,802 --> 00:59:40,223
[SPEAKER_02]: First, what you need to do on your PlayStation 3 is create a new user account for your PlayStation 3.

860
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:44,144
[SPEAKER_02]: It cannot be an existing user or a sub-user.

861
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:45,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be completely from scratch.

862
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:46,546
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

863
01:00:12,398 --> 01:00:17,181
[SPEAKER_02]: roughly at, I believe, $40 in Hong Kong twice.

864
01:00:17,642 --> 01:00:24,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you've done that, I guess that it's just under the radar for confirming your address or something like that.

865
01:00:24,686 --> 01:00:31,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've done that, you're able to purchase the Tekken Dark Resurrection game from Japan.

866
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,911
[SPEAKER_03]: You better hurry up and do it now because you know Sony's going to close the loophole on that within days.

867
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:35,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

868
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:40,995
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really want it... So do that now or just wait for it to come out.

869
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:42,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

870
01:00:59,654 --> 01:01:04,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about the top purchased arcade titles according to Major Nelson's list.

871
01:01:05,477 --> 01:01:09,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off with the number 20 was Luminous Live, which I thought was kind of low on the list.

872
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:25,626
[SPEAKER_03]: 19, Cloning Clyde, 18, Small Arms, 17, Feeding Frenzy, 16, Bejeweled 2, 15, Texas Hold'em, 14, Zuma, 13, Contra, 12, Smash TV, 11, Bankshot Billiards 2, 10, Frogger, 9, Gauntlet, 8, Galaga, 7, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, 6, Doom,

873
01:01:27,246 --> 01:01:30,848
[SPEAKER_03]: 5, Pac-Man, 4, Marble Blast Ultra, which seems a little high.

874
01:01:31,148 --> 01:01:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it's a good game, don't get me wrong, just I didn't think it would be that popular.

875
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:41,654
[SPEAKER_03]: 3, Geometry Wars Evolved, 2, Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting, and 1 was Uno, which isn't very surprising.

876
01:01:41,674 --> 01:01:42,014
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big duh.

877
01:01:43,374 --> 01:01:44,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they gave it out for free.

878
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:49,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, it was one of those ones that had porn and stuff, so not a huge surprise.

879
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:50,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

880
01:01:50,894 --> 01:02:07,281
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the top Xbox 360 titles, 20, Splinter Cell Double Agent, 19, Battlefield 18, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, 17, Need for Speed Most Wanted, 16, Dead Rising, 15, Madden NFL 07, 14, Texas Hold'em, 13, Dead or Alive 4, 12, Geometry Wars Evolved, 11, Saints Row,

881
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:33,913
[SPEAKER_03]: 10, EA Sports, Fight Night Round 3, 9, Uno, 8, Call of Duty 3, 7, Perfect Dark Zero, 6, Project Gotham Racing 3, 5, Oblivion, 4, Ghost Recon 3, 3, Call of Duty 2, 2, Hexic HD, because, you know, it was on all the hard drives, which is surprising because they left that off the arcade titles list.

882
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:36,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was an arcade title, but never mind.

883
01:02:36,594 --> 01:02:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And number one, Gears of War, of course.

884
01:02:40,196 --> 01:02:40,976
[SPEAKER_03]: No big surprise there.

885
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:43,657
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

886
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:45,426
[SPEAKER_03]: PhotoshopSupport.com

887
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:15,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, tutorials, tools, resources, there's a good link with lots of brushes.

888
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:18,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, lots of just good stuff on it.

889
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:21,231
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even, uh, free, uh, stock photos.

890
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:27,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's, uh, flash resources, Dreamweaver resources, fonts, textures, you name it.

891
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:30,337
[SPEAKER_01]: This site is really, really freaking cool.

892
01:03:30,998 --> 01:03:37,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I, I'm going to, to vote, uh, PhotoshopSupport.com as my, uh, website of the week.

893
01:03:40,731 --> 01:03:42,112
[SPEAKER_03]: So surf there right now.

894
01:03:42,392 --> 01:03:43,592
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time, DarkSakura.

895
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:47,915
[SPEAKER_01]: PhotoshopSupport.com If you can't spell it, I ain't spelling it out for you.

896
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:48,535
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

897
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:56,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing that we're not spelling is lawsuit for L-A-W-S-U-I-T lawsuit.

898
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:57,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dead!

899
01:03:59,140 --> 01:03:59,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it spelled by?

900
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:00,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

901
01:04:02,362 --> 01:04:02,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways.

902
01:04:03,102 --> 01:04:08,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, lawsuit between OverGuitarHero with, of course, guitars and

903
01:04:09,723 --> 01:04:11,986
[SPEAKER_02]: RedOctane, Activision, and the Ant Commandos

904
01:04:31,584 --> 01:04:32,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

905
01:04:32,985 --> 01:04:34,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's kind of going their own way.

906
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:40,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes sense since, well, you know, Red Octane, they've fucking made third-party guitars for a long time now.

907
01:04:40,828 --> 01:04:47,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, this is like, I don't know, what's... It sounds to me like they kissed a mate up somehow, one way or another.

908
01:04:48,531 --> 01:04:50,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone blew somebody, I think.

909
01:04:51,653 --> 01:04:52,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways...

910
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:57,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so all that's better now.

911
01:04:57,392 --> 01:05:00,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really matter anyways, because if you wanted a wireless guitar, you can always buy the official one, I guess.

912
01:05:01,014 --> 01:05:04,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the Guitar Hero 2 360 box art?

913
01:05:06,217 --> 01:05:07,738
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't get to pull that up at work.

914
01:05:07,978 --> 01:05:08,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.

915
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:12,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a story coming up on it later in Part B, at least specifically what's in the game, so I won't spoil that.

916
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:15,102
[SPEAKER_03]: But the box art's very interesting because it's all white.

917
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:22,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so weird because you're used to thinking, you know, you see the Guitar Hero boxes, they're black, but of course, this is more the Xbox 360's color scheme, so it's kind of interesting.

918
01:05:23,146 --> 01:05:24,607
[SPEAKER_03]: They just look different to me.

919
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:26,607
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

920
01:05:51,357 --> 01:05:53,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Will Wright is kind of performing that role.

921
01:05:53,498 --> 01:06:00,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, SimCity DS is not based on the old SimCity, but it looks like it runs on, I think it's either the 2000 or the 3000 engine.

922
01:06:00,501 --> 01:06:04,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's SimCity 3, not 2000.

923
01:06:04,763 --> 01:06:08,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks a little too in-depth, or they might have enhanced it a little bit.

924
01:06:09,124 --> 01:06:14,387
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way, it's that more 3D ISO type of view than the old school SimCity was.

925
01:06:15,891 --> 01:06:17,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much we're going to agree with this.

926
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:50,988
[SPEAKER_01]: But Eurogamer posted their top 50 games of 2006, and I've got the top 10.

927
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:54,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone would like to know, I'll read them off.

928
01:06:55,372 --> 01:06:56,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, why not?

929
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess one more best of 06 list to close us out.

930
01:07:00,155 --> 01:07:04,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 10 is Professor Kalashima's Brain Training, How Old Is Your Brain?

931
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And number 9 is Wii Sports.

932
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:14,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 8 is Viva Pinata.

933
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:16,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I need to actually play that, huh?

934
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,861
[SPEAKER_01]: 7 is Gears of War.

935
01:07:19,881 --> 01:07:23,343
[SPEAKER_01]: 6 is Lego Star Wars 2.

936
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:32,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Those games are actually pretty fun, but I got really pissed off at the one that came out a year before.

937
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:40,435
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 is Dead Rising, because there's something really awesome about running over zombies with a lawnmower and cutting their heads off with a scythe.

938
01:07:41,817 --> 01:07:43,078
[SPEAKER_01]: 4 is Final Fantasy XII.

939
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:49,062
[SPEAKER_01]: 3 is The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which Dan and I are currently playing through.

940
01:07:49,923 --> 01:07:51,544
[SPEAKER_01]: 2 is Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

941
01:07:52,825 --> 01:07:56,848
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number one game is... Your mom.

942
01:07:56,968 --> 01:07:57,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooking Mama.

943
01:07:57,789 --> 01:07:58,589
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Guitar Hero.

944
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

945
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Guitar Hero won number one.

946
01:08:02,072 --> 01:08:03,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because that just came out in Europe this year.

947
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay, okay, I can see that.

948
01:08:06,463 --> 01:08:12,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And to quote one of the folks from Eurogamer, Keza, it says, if you don't like Guitar Hero, you have no soul.

949
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:18,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, though, I'm getting a little... I'm a little burned out on Guitar Hero.

950
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:19,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little burned out on it.

951
01:08:19,725 --> 01:08:24,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not God's gift to video games like the media is portraying it to be.

952
01:08:24,787 --> 01:08:25,528
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not.

953
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:28,089
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Guitar Hero, but I found out I can't play it drunk.

954
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:33,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I've been playing music games for years, and not to sound elitist or anything, so I'm sorry if I sound that way.

955
01:08:34,192 --> 01:08:37,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand Guitar Hero made the music game genre more accessible.

956
01:08:37,194 --> 01:08:37,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.

957
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:39,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think it's a good game.

958
01:08:39,135 --> 01:08:40,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great game, in fact.

959
01:08:40,776 --> 01:08:41,997
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think it's like, you know, aww.

960
01:08:43,197 --> 01:08:44,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Sound the chorus of angels.

961
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:47,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking Guitar Freaks 2DX, basically.

962
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

963
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:50,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I've kind of seen this before.

964
01:08:50,983 --> 01:08:52,083
[SPEAKER_03]: What's so freaking great about it?

965
01:08:52,103 --> 01:09:04,251
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it's just that it made it more accessible through the fact that as much as we have loved Konami's Bomani title, they've never really fully been Americanized, if that makes sense.

966
01:09:04,291 --> 01:09:06,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So whenever they try to Americanize them, it doesn't always work.

967
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:10,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think they're letting the Japanese teams Americanize the games, and that doesn't work.

968
01:09:14,373 --> 01:09:18,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of top 10s, I never posted mine to the site, so I'm going to read it for you now.

969
01:09:18,475 --> 01:09:19,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to know my top 10 games of 2006?

970
01:09:19,976 --> 01:09:21,437
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

971
01:09:21,878 --> 01:09:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, too bad.

972
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:23,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to tell you anyway.

973
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I did like Eurogamer's List, though.

974
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:27,221
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why I like Eurogamer's List?

975
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:32,725
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because I like their reviews over there, because they will tell it like it is over there.

976
01:09:32,765 --> 01:09:33,966
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was interesting to hear that.

977
01:09:34,406 --> 01:09:38,849
[SPEAKER_03]: But now mine, and here's the ones that I thought were the 10 best games of 2006.

978
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:42,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 10, I said Sneak King on the 360.

979
01:09:43,573 --> 01:09:47,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you might think I'm crazy, but get this.

980
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:55,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an original title, the game was four bucks, and it was probably better than most of the games that Xbox released in arcade for five or more.

981
01:09:55,622 --> 01:09:59,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think about it, it's one of the best gaming values of the year, and it absolutely deserves recognition.

982
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it came off better than anyone thought it would.

983
01:10:03,147 --> 01:10:10,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Sneak King, I know it seems weird to put it on a top ten list, but I felt it needed some type of recognition for kind of what it did.

984
01:10:10,993 --> 01:10:12,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It did something really, really original.

985
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:16,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 9, I said Phantasy Star Universe

986
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:23,626
[SPEAKER_03]: and the reason why I said that is because you have massive replayability over previous versions of Phantasy Star Online in my mind.

987
01:10:23,726 --> 01:10:37,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You have single player mode and that would be the type of game that usually you'd think would be sold by itself but on top of that you have the online mode, rationed unlocks that kind of keep the game going and makes the world ever expanding, keeps online mode fresh.

988
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:43,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Number eight, I said Kingdom Hearts 2 which I think far too many people overlooked amongst the 2006 releases.

989
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:45,272
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an epic game in every sense of the word.

990
01:10:45,832 --> 01:10:54,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Make improvements to the original, kept a fresh storyline, and even if you consider that some of the old worlds from the first game return, I mean, they kept it fresh.

991
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

992
01:10:55,301 --> 01:11:03,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it has a three-hour opening, but the fact that it's got, like, the year's probably one of the best soundtracks of the year, amazing visuals, and fucking Tron World.

993
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:05,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough said.

994
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Tron World.

995
01:11:06,651 --> 01:11:07,432
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the best games of the year.

996
01:11:07,832 --> 01:11:09,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Number seven, I said Trauma Center Second Opinion.

997
01:11:10,834 --> 01:11:13,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo certainly knows how to milk its retro franchises for all they are worth.

998
01:11:35,363 --> 01:11:36,363
[SPEAKER_03]: but New Super Mario Bros.

999
01:11:36,403 --> 01:12:00,727
[SPEAKER_03]: takes this old formula gives it a kick in the pants this is the game people wanted on the GameCube everybody wanted to see a game like this on the GameCube and for whatever reason Nintendo said now we'll put it on the DS and it's like people read our minds and they got it when you know we say that the next generation of gaming you don't have to make everything in 3D you can make visually appealing 2D games and New Super Mario Bros.

1000
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: was it so definitely it was one of the best titles of the year

1001
01:12:05,282 --> 01:12:06,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising Dead Rising

1002
01:12:32,725 --> 01:12:35,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Having a fresh story, and the battle system is phenomenal.

1003
01:12:36,547 --> 01:12:42,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And it feels simple in the game's first hours, but as you play more, it gets so engaging, and it's great.

1004
01:12:42,769 --> 01:12:44,290
[SPEAKER_03]: 16.99 widescreen support in the U.S.

1005
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:48,492
[SPEAKER_03]: helps the game kind of keep up with the next gen of gaming.

1006
01:12:49,312 --> 01:12:57,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I think it was maybe released a little too late for enough people to notice this title, but it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy role-playing games at all.

1007
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents

1008
01:13:17,882 --> 01:13:20,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess

1009
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: CookieMama!

1010
01:13:38,717 --> 01:13:39,138
[SPEAKER_03]: CookieMama!

1011
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:39,478
[SPEAKER_03]: CookieMama!

1012
01:14:09,788 --> 01:14:13,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I'll read them off and you can explain your picks if you want.

1013
01:14:13,629 --> 01:14:15,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you should read off what I put on there because it was funny.

1014
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:17,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, hold on.

1015
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:17,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1016
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:17,831
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got?

1017
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:20,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I have... Okay, here we go.

1018
01:14:20,852 --> 01:14:22,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki picked Final Fantasy XII.

1019
01:14:22,413 --> 01:14:24,234
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the number 10 best game of the year.

1020
01:14:24,674 --> 01:14:29,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure somewhere in the video game top list guidelines it says we are required to put at least one Final Fantasy game in any top 10 list.

1021
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:31,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year it's Final Fantasy XII.

1022
01:14:31,757 --> 01:14:33,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sexy, new, and everyone wants to be it.

1023
01:14:33,938 --> 01:14:34,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be its friends.

1024
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:38,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That is until Final Fantasy XIII comes out, all 50 different versions of it.

1025
01:14:39,278 --> 01:14:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these are in no particular order also.

1026
01:14:40,539 --> 01:14:40,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

1027
01:14:41,099 --> 01:14:41,740
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just my top ten.

1028
01:15:05,713 --> 01:15:06,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, too bad.

1029
01:15:06,434 --> 01:15:07,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming this is the order.

1030
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:09,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize Super Mario Bros.

1031
01:15:09,816 --> 01:15:10,997
[SPEAKER_03]: 3.5 could be so much fun.

1032
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:13,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you can't beat the old 2D platformer days.

1033
01:15:13,919 --> 01:15:15,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hope we get some more like this on every system.

1034
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:18,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 6 was Gears of War.

1035
01:15:18,503 --> 01:15:19,904
[SPEAKER_03]: The killer app before Halo 3.

1036
01:15:20,264 --> 01:15:21,966
[SPEAKER_03]: A very intense and albeit hard game.

1037
01:15:22,626 --> 01:15:24,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 5 was Twilight Princess.

1038
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:25,608
[SPEAKER_03]: We've waited so long for a new Zelda.

1039
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:27,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything we could have wanted.

1040
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:30,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 4 was Excite Truck.

1041
01:15:31,033 --> 01:15:32,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's why you said this is no order.

1042
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:36,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Who in their right mind would put Excite Truck above Twilight Princess, you idiot?

1043
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:37,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Me?

1044
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, read.

1045
01:15:39,422 --> 01:15:42,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like Nintendo's BEA to the punch for a burnout off-road.

1046
01:15:43,086 --> 01:15:48,332
[SPEAKER_03]: A great launch game for the Wii that converted at least two non-gamers, my wife and extrovert, into full-fledged gamers.

1047
01:15:49,013 --> 01:15:49,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's a good point.

1048
01:15:50,435 --> 01:15:50,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

1049
01:15:51,376 --> 01:15:52,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, Saints Row.

1050
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:55,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Grand Theft Auto 3.5.

1051
01:15:55,730 --> 01:16:00,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent countless lunches hurling grenades and rockets at cops while speeding away in my riced-out minifan.

1052
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:03,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be playing this game until Saints Row 2 comes out, or Grand Theft Auto 4.

1053
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:08,636
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Loki, the number two best game of the year was Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

1054
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to give props to a game that would let me rob a guild bear, punch a deer, and set fire to civilians in the course of one day and wearing nothing but a loincloth.

1055
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:17,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said.

1056
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said.

1057
01:16:19,383 --> 01:16:24,927
[SPEAKER_03]: and the number one game according to Loki in 2006, and I totally disagree, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

1058
01:16:25,568 --> 01:16:33,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite its incredibly flawed targeting system and rather frustrating glitches, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories is the most fun you'll ever have on the PSP ad hoc multiplayer.

1059
01:16:34,194 --> 01:16:39,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only hope that GTA 4 is up to this level of fun, just for the love of God, beta the multiplayer more than five minutes.

1060
01:16:39,578 --> 01:16:45,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think exactly for those reasons, the fact that it had some bad beta-ing, you should not have put that game anywhere near your top ten.

1061
01:16:45,983 --> 01:16:47,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in no particular order, that's why I put it there.

1062
01:16:48,462 --> 01:17:16,873
[SPEAKER_03]: so, whatever alright, there you go and then NM64 says Loki admitted his wife's a gamer JVmon says Rob, I would put Excite Truck before Zelda I don't know you guys it's a good game I think Excite Truck is horribly underrated and it probably would be in my top 15 but the worst part about Excite Truck is it was too short that's it that's the worst part about it alright, Jamie has a list she'd like to share my number 10 is actually DDR Supernova

1063
01:17:17,628 --> 01:17:22,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's bringing DDR back to the arcade, giving everybody what they want.

1064
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:23,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a good thing.

1065
01:17:23,812 --> 01:17:26,474
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of helped rebuilding the whole community, and that makes me happy.

1066
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:31,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And 9 is the Super Mario Bros., just because it's Super Mario Bros., and that game's actually kind of hard.

1067
01:17:31,437 --> 01:17:37,281
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 is Resistance Fall of Man, because it's pretty, and you explode heads and stuff.

1068
01:17:38,277 --> 01:18:02,751
[SPEAKER_01]: and I actually like Guitar Hero 2 so it's on there for my number 7 and number 6 is Trauma Center because that game is fucking frustrating and evil and has people screaming loudly at their DS's and then 5 is Wii Sports because it's actually kind of fun 4 would be Zelda 3 is Pirates of the Caribbean Pinball What?

1069
01:18:03,232 --> 01:18:03,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay

1070
01:18:04,674 --> 01:18:06,715
[SPEAKER_03]: You really thought outside the box for your picks.

1071
01:18:07,036 --> 01:18:08,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you are a pinball whore, I'll take it.

1072
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:10,378
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm married to a pinball whore.

1073
01:18:11,118 --> 01:18:11,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand, I understand.

1074
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:16,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Two is going to be all the Flash games on the Doctor Who website.

1075
01:18:16,782 --> 01:18:19,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, you loser.

1076
01:18:19,664 --> 01:18:21,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Your list just lost all credibility.

1077
01:18:21,485 --> 01:18:21,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

1078
01:18:22,886 --> 01:18:27,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the game where he's the drawing and you have to walk him through the thing.

1079
01:18:27,429 --> 01:18:27,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Failed.

1080
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:28,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Clank.

1081
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:31,111
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is Cooking Mama.

1082
01:18:31,812 --> 01:18:32,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

1083
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:34,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

1084
01:18:36,214 --> 01:18:40,716
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the only gamer girl I can think of that would put Cooking Mama at the top of her list with pride.

1085
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:42,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Very well done.

1086
01:18:42,397 --> 01:18:43,137
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great!

1087
01:18:43,597 --> 01:18:44,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooking Mama is awesome!

1088
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:48,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year, her number one game will be driving training.

1089
01:18:49,019 --> 01:18:49,280
[SPEAKER_01]: What?!

1090
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, you're a woman.

1091
01:18:54,182 --> 01:18:55,062
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good radio.

1092
01:18:56,185 --> 01:19:21,242
[SPEAKER_03]: and on that note we should probably go to break while DarkSakura kicks my ass out in the parking lot so we'll be back after this with we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio Part B Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
