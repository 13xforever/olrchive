14000	19000	Tonight, January 7th, 2007, Xbox 360 upgrade rumors abound,
19000	25000	Nintendo partners with an MMO developer, and prepare to waste even more time with Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
25000	33000	Music
33000	37000	Welcome back, live listeners, to a new year of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	44000	We are that radio program on the interweb dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
51000	54000	You will be like us, of greatest compulsory.
54000	56000	One of us, one of us.
56000	58000	How are you, my dear?
58000	59000	Upgraded.
59000	60000	Upgraded.
60000	63000	I heard because you made me play DDR, you bitch.
63000	65000	DDR was fun today.
65000	66000	It was fun.
66000	67000	Good times.
67000	68000	It was fun.
68000	72000	Say hello as well to recently upgraded tech master, Loki.
72000	73000	Hello.
73000	74000	Now with more anger and angst.
74000	75000	It's great.
75000	76000	Sure.
76000	77000	Yeah, all right.
77000	78000	Now how you doing?
78000	79000	Good.
79000	80000	You going to Macworld?
80000	81000	Oh yeah, totally.
81000	83000	I'm there.
83000	84000	All right.
84000	87000	Welcome, by the way, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
87000	91000	I know we got some new listeners while we were off on holiday for a little while.
91000	97000	Thanks as well to all the sites that joined us last week for the New Year's Eve special.
97000	102000	And then they turned around and pimped us out on their respective sites.
102000	103000	We really appreciate you guys doing that.
103000	105000	So I know we got some new listeners from that.
105000	110000	So just to kind of set the stage, since it is a new year, let's do the whole spiel about what we're all about.
110000	112000	Again, since it is new year, 2007.
112000	115000	So Orange Lounge Radio, we formed in the year 2002.
115000	117000	And we actually all met playing DDR.
117000	118000	Go figure.
118000	122000	But you know, you remember when arcades were actually kind of cool and like a lot of people went there.
122000	127000	And you know, it wasn't just about the little ticket spitting games and the place was riddled with children.
127000	131000	When arcades were cool, Dark Soccer, myself and Loki all met up.
131000	135000	And we just decided, you know, because Dark Soccer and I had kind of known each other a little bit before that.
135000	138000	We were doing another radio program under station live.
138000	140000	And we thought, hey, let's do a show about video games.
140000	142000	Okay. And then, you know, Loki joined us for that.
142000	146000	And here we are almost five years later, still doing it.
146000	149000	So the show started about music video games.
149000	154000	So sometimes you hear Orange Lounge Radio, the Bobani radio station, which, you know, we still love our music based games.
154000	157000	But we like to think that we are gaming fans first.
157000	158000	We just love video games in general.
158000	159000	So that's what the show is all about now.
159000	164000	So the show we try to present to you guys here every week is that we go over the news.
164000	166000	And yeah, you know, we only do a show once a week.
166000	168000	We only do a show once a week.
168000	172000	So you're not always going to get the latest and greatest here.
172000	180000	We do have the fortunate luck of having Loki working in the industry in an area that most media doesn't think to look in, which is distribution.
180000	182000	So sometimes we get some pretty good exclusives that way.
182000	191000	But otherwise, you know, we're kind of like we imagine one thing we used to do when we were at the arcades is that, you know, remember when we did like the Wednesday night, we'd get together, play DDR.
191000	192000	And then what do we do afterwards?
192000	195000	We went to Brookfield's and just, you know, talk.
195000	196000	Pinned out?
196000	200000	Yeah, well, we ate a lot and then we nerded out talking about stuff.
200000	201000	So that's kind of what we are.
201000	210000	We're the folks sitting around the dinner table at, you know, your local diner talking about games and talking smack when appropriate and talking about good things.
210000	215000	And we like to invite guests to our table once in a while from the gaming industry, hoping to have some good names on in 2007.
215000	217000	And we like to invite all of you.
217000	219000	We like to fill up the restaurant with our listeners.
219000	225000	We know that the majority of our listeners catch us on the audio blog, also known as podcast, which is released every Monday and Wednesday.
225000	227000	But we also have our live listeners.
227000	233000	We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on Orange Lounge Radio, orangeloungeradio.com.
233000	236000	We have a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week station.
236000	237000	We're not the only show on it.
237000	242000	In fact, every weeknight but Monday, you can hear some type of nerd program on the station.
242000	246000	Tuesday nights, at least for right now, just the first Tuesday of every month.
246000	248000	But we're hoping to have something to fill in the gaps in the interim.
248000	253000	We have pump up the volume and then something unannounced that will be filling in the gaps on Tuesday in the interim.
253000	258000	And then Wednesday nights, we have Guys on a Show, which is kind of like pop culture, geek culture stuff.
258000	261000	Thursday nights, STFU, which is really fast-paced game talk.
261000	263000	It's more like a sports show.
263000	266000	Friday nights, we have Club OLR, which is just strictly music.
266000	270000	And by the way, if you missed this week's Club OLR, you did a fantastic job mixing music this week, Loki.
270000	271000	I'm not just saying that.
271000	272000	It was awesome.
272000	273000	I loved it.
273000	274000	I thought it was great.
274000	275000	Would you do a rip-off of something else?
275000	276000	No, no.
276000	277000	I didn't rip anything off.
277000	278000	I thought you did a great job.
278000	280000	Maybe you hurried through it or something.
280000	282000	A little bit of trivia for those folks out there.
282000	287000	Live Wire from the first episode was actually the second episode I did.
287000	290000	And then I flipped them.
290000	291000	I see.
291000	294000	Because I liked one of them better than the other one.
294000	295000	Oh, I liked it.
295000	296000	That was good.
296000	300000	So, Saturday nights, Travis Donovan Live, geek sci-fi gaming 360.
300000	305000	You know, whatever's on his mind, trying to bring a little dose of reality to you kids.
305000	307000	And of course, Sunday nights, we're here.
307000	309000	All right, enough plugs for the side projects.
309000	312000	We want to welcome all of our new and old listeners.
312000	314000	Those have been with us for so many years.
314000	316000	And those that are just joining us, new this week.
316000	317000	We had some noobs in chat tonight.
317000	319000	So, we want to say hi to the noobs.
319000	321000	I think I saw NZ Gamer said he was a noob.
321000	322000	Hi, noob.
322000	324000	And somebody else said they were a noob, too.
324000	326000	We had PH Alfan was a noob.
326000	327000	Hi, noob.
327000	328000	Welcome.
328000	332000	So, and okay, let's get into how we like to start off every show.
332000	334000	A little bit of how was your gaming week?
334000	336000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
336000	337000	What have you been playing?
337000	338000	You made me play DDR.
338000	339000	I did.
339000	340000	It was fun.
340000	341000	Yeah, it was.
341000	347000	I played also some BeatMania 3, was it the sixth, I think?
347000	349000	Yeah, sixth mix.
349000	352000	Played some Cooking Mama.
352000	353000	Played some Pinball.
353000	360000	We got our Who Done It back, which is now Trading Potter.
360000	362000	And I joined Guild Wars this week.
362000	366000	I didn't really care for it the last time I tried it, but I gave it a go this time around.
366000	368000	It was more fun.
368000	373000	I don't know if I'm going to stick with it, but I figure at the very least, if I pay the
373000	376000	money for it, I can just play it whenever I want and don't have to worry about anything,
376000	378000	so I'm thinking about it.
378000	381000	I've been playing with my friend Heather.
381000	383000	It's pretty cool.
383000	384000	All right.
384000	385000	More Cooking Mama, huh?
385000	386000	Have you beat Cooking Mama yet?
386000	387000	No.
387000	389000	I came this close to buying Cooking Mama, but I'm holding out for the Wii version.
389000	391000	Yeah, I'm both.
391000	392000	Well, but the thing was-
392000	393000	Completion!
393000	397000	I think Trauma Center was that much better on the Wii because I kind of just didn't get
397000	399000	around to playing the DS version.
399000	403000	It was so awesome when I played it on the Wii, so I'm kind of holding off for my Mama
403000	404000	until the Wii version.
404000	405000	Don't worry.
405000	406000	I'll be showing Mama some love.
406000	407000	Don't worry.
407000	413000	And to make a rebuttal to Holy Shonen, I think you're wrong.
413000	414000	What did Holy Shonen say?
414000	416000	World of Warcraft is better than Guild Wars.
416000	418000	World of Warcraft is just more annoying than Guild Wars.
418000	420000	You know, it just kind of depends.
420000	421000	I don't know.
421000	423000	They're almost exactly the same game.
423000	425000	I don't see what the point is.
425000	426000	I don't care.
426000	427000	You don't-
427000	428000	I'm going to be playing them both.
428000	433000	I understand because Guild Wars, you kind of level up to 20 and pretty much the entire
433000	437000	game is end game, but World of Warcraft has a little more in the interim because you know
437000	438000	you're going all the way to 60.
438000	439000	There's a lot more to do in the interim.
439000	442000	I guess if you're addicted to leveling, that's fine, but I think that Guild Wars takes a
442000	443000	little bit more skill to play.
443000	444000	I don't know.
444000	445000	I don't know.
445000	448000	They're just very similar in game structure to me.
448000	449000	I don't know.
449000	450000	I don't really prefer one to the other.
450000	453000	I like the fact that Guild Wars I can go to whenever I want for free, like once I've bought
453000	456000	it, but you know that the game still has not dropped in price.
456000	459000	If you want to get the old school Guild Wars, you have to pay the full 50 bucks for it,
459000	460000	which is interesting.
460000	465000	Yeah, but keep in mind, say you're paying, what is it, $9.99 a month for-
465000	466000	Wow?
466000	467000	For World of Warcraft, right?
467000	469000	Isn't it like $12 or $14.95?
469000	470000	I can't even remember.
470000	471000	Yeah, it's more like $12, but just-
471000	475000	I think Final Fantasy is $12.95 and WoW is like $14.
475000	476000	I can't remember.
476000	477000	Something like that.
477000	482000	Anyway, you're going to end up paying more in a year for World of Warcraft than you are
482000	487000	going to pay for Guild Wars.
487000	490000	I did feel like the WoW universe was way more expansive, though.
490000	492000	There was a lot more to see in WoW.
492000	495000	But the fundamental difference between the two, here's the fundamental difference between
495000	496000	the two.
496000	500000	In Guild Wars, the entire game is what you would call an instance in WoW.
500000	504000	That's alluring to some people, the fact that they play with exactly who they want
504000	505000	and that's it.
505000	506000	You know what I mean?
506000	510000	It's like when you go out into the world, it's your world with your friends, and that's
510000	513000	either the upside to Guild Wars or it's the downside.
513000	517000	If you like to meet new people, then Guild Wars may not be the better name.
517000	518000	Well, that's why you have their talent.
518000	520000	So you meet people there.
520000	523000	Well, anyway, before we get into further argument, you know what?
523000	524000	Just play Final Fantasy XI.
524000	527000	Then you just wait all day for a party and never get anything done.
527000	531000	Oh, and I have to also tell GS68 that Ghost Squad is freaking fun as hell.
531000	532000	What are you talking about?
532000	533000	What?
533000	534000	GS68.
534000	536000	I was talking about Ghost Squad.
536000	538000	It's a gun game in the arcades.
538000	540000	That game is freaking hot.
540000	541000	I love that game.
541000	542000	I haven't played a good gun game in a while.
542000	545000	I haven't played it in ages, but Dan and I went and we just freaking played through
545000	546000	every mission and it was great.
546000	549000	Every time I want to play Time Crisis 4, somebody's on it.
549000	550000	Oh well.
550000	552000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
552000	554000	It was pretty good.
554000	555000	Full of lots of stuff.
555000	563000	I got a PlayStation 3, and so I played lots of Resistance, and that game is far better
563000	565000	than Gears of War.
565000	568000	I love that game.
568000	570000	It's very pretty.
570000	577000	Looking at Resistance makes you question, hey, maybe the PlayStation 3 actually does
577000	580000	look better than the 360, and it really looks good.
580000	585000	In fact, I found myself literally, between gunfights, standing there going, wow, this
585000	587000	looks really good.
587000	590000	What a fucking change for the year 2007 on this program.
590000	592000	You are gushing about Sony tonight.
592000	593000	What the hell?
593000	594000	No, no, no.
594000	595000	Hold on, hold on.
595000	596000	Is he drinking?
596000	597000	Resistance is good, okay?
597000	598000	Now...
598000	599000	Didn't I tell you?
599000	600000	That game is hot.
600000	601000	It's awesome.
601000	602000	That's it.
602000	603000	But here's the problem, though.
603000	604000	That is it.
604000	606000	Unfortunately, that's all that's out there.
606000	607000	I mean...
607000	608000	Whoa, back up.
608000	609000	You got a PS3?
609000	610000	Yeah, I got a PS3.
610000	612000	So I'm the only OLR host without a PS3?
612000	613000	Well, I got mine.
613000	616000	I got hooked up, okay, for the PlayStation 3.
616000	617000	Hey, hey.
617000	620000	I'm the only one without the cool new toys.
620000	621000	Yeah, I know.
621000	622000	Hey, Ron.
622000	623000	What?
623000	624000	Hi.
624000	628000	You're just not part of the PS Wii 60 club, so whatever.
628000	630000	I heart my Wii 60.
630000	631000	Screw you.
631000	633000	Anyway, so, no, seriously, though.
633000	634000	It's fun.
634000	640000	It really is fun, and I like it so much better than Gears of War.
640000	645000	And the fact there's so many different difficulties you can play it on, so if you really aren't
645000	649000	all hardcore into it and stuff, you can have a good time with it.
649000	650000	So it's very good.
650000	651000	I like it.
651000	653000	Um, Ridge Racer 7.
653000	657000	Yes, I bought Ridge Racer 7 because Nelly actually wanted to play it.
657000	662000	You know, and to be honest, I've played it, and it's exactly the same as Ridge Racer 6.
662000	663500	It pretty much is.
663500	667000	Well, now, you said earlier, though, that you felt Resistance was better than anything
667000	668000	you'd see on the 360.
668000	673500	So, because Ridge Racer 7 and 6 are so similar, did you think that, graphically, the PlayStation
673500	674500	3 one was superior?
674500	675500	No.
675500	676500	Because I remember a while back, no.
676500	680000	Both were comparing the two and saying the 360 version looked better.
680000	682000	I shouldn't say the 360 version, but you know what I mean.
682000	683000	Honestly, I couldn't pick up the differences.
683000	688500	The only difference I saw was when you hit your Nitro, instead of the screen kind of
688500	691500	turning white on the edges, it did this weird blur thing.
691500	693000	But that's about it.
693000	698500	So, I do like Ridge Racer 7 and how they have different ways you can customize your cars
698500	699500	and stuff.
699500	700500	That's kind of cool.
700500	701500	So, yeah.
701500	705500	Full Auto 2 was another one I picked up on that as well.
705500	707500	I mean, I was a huge fan of Full Auto 1.
707500	709500	Which is sold back this week.
709500	712500	And, Full Auto 2 is, it's okay.
712500	714500	It's just like the first game.
714500	716500	I didn't really notice any differences.
716500	722000	I mean, the graphics look a little different, but it's pretty much the first game all over
722000	723000	again.
723000	724000	So, that's kind of cool.
724000	726500	Let's do some chat room comments, because the chat room is on fire tonight.
726500	730060	We've got a lot of new people in chat, and I think they've got three weeks of comments
730060	731260	just penting up here.
731260	735140	Mike W. says, Rob was also the only OLR host without a 360 for a while.
735140	736140	That's true.
736140	737140	I didn't get a 360 until March.
737140	738140	To be honest, though.
738140	742220	You eBayed it, or Craigslisted it or something and paid way too much for one, and she got
742220	743780	the hookup because Dan was looking at it.
743780	748380	To be honest, though, I wouldn't have bought a PS3 if I hadn't, you know.
748380	749380	Yeah, you got a hookup.
749380	750380	I know.
750380	751380	You got a...
751380	752380	Do you have to put out for that?
752380	753380	No.
753380	754380	Oh, that's good.
754380	755380	Let's see.
755380	756380	What else do we have here?
756380	757380	We have...
757380	758620	Jeremy Todd 1 says, Loki, I don't care what you say.
758620	759620	Nellie is a gamer now.
759620	762380	Nellie, of course, being Loki's wife.
762380	763380	She's now reading.
763380	766140	She's reading a new Harry Potter.
766140	769340	Rama says, hey Rob, you're not missing anything with the Doorstop 3.
769340	771060	You know, there really isn't anything...
771060	772060	I actually...
772060	775300	What I would want most out of it right now is the Blu-ray player, and fucking Tekken
775300	777300	Dark Resurrection.
777300	778300	That looks pretty badass.
778300	782420	I haven't downloaded that, because it's in another country, and I don't like fighting
782420	785100	games that much, so it's not a big deal for me.
785100	791140	But I tried Grip Shift, and that blows ass, and I would not recommend it at all.
791140	792580	Motorstorm is fucking awesome.
792580	793580	I love the demo for Motorstorm.
793580	794980	I did not like Motorstorm at all.
794980	795980	Oh, I love Motorstorm.
795980	797860	You didn't think it was slow?
797860	798860	I thought it was slow.
798860	799860	No, it's good.
799860	800860	It's good.
800860	801860	I like it.
801860	802860	Is it just maybe the target?
802860	803860	I don't know.
803860	806580	Jaden says, next week, Loki takes back everything he said about Max, because he received a Mac
806580	808540	and gloats about it.
808540	810260	Could this be the year of change for Loki?
810260	813980	No, listen, if I got a free Mac, I would be selling that shit back.
813980	816620	I'd actually probably smash it with a hammer, or give it to Nellie.
816620	817620	She'd probably want it.
817620	820260	But no, other than...
820260	823020	Mac fans, don't turn us off, because I heart Max, and so does Jamie.
823020	824020	He's just crazy.
824020	825020	I just don't like them.
825020	826700	I'm sure we're building a PC.
826700	831540	And I don't know if anyone's seen the new pictures of the new VAIO, but my god, Sony's
831540	833380	copying Apple now.
833380	834380	That's pretty bad.
834380	837840	Anyways, so back in the games, real quick.
837840	840840	So yeah, I played that Gran Turismo HD.
840840	844500	It actually looks better than the one at E3, but not by much.
844500	849100	So thank god it's free, because I sure as hell wouldn't buy that piece of shit.
849100	851620	I don't like Gran Turismo, so that's just me.
851620	856320	It looks pretty, I guess, but I don't know.
856320	860780	It seems to me, and this is what I've noticed with a lot of the games on there, seems to
860780	865260	be a lot of these racing games, because that's mainly what I've been playing, have the kind
865260	869700	of okay foreground stuff, and they have this really high-res background image that's kind
869700	870980	of plastered on there.
870980	874340	I don't know if you've noticed that in some of the pictures of Gran Turismo HD and Motor
874340	875340	Storm and stuff.
875340	879740	It's kind of simple than this big high-res thing that looks really pretty, and people
879740	884740	are thinking that it's rendered, but it's not.
884740	886060	Is that it for your gaming week?
886060	888900	Call of Duty 3 multiplayer on the 360 was awesome.
888900	894000	I love that game, but I think I'm going to play Resistance instead, and of course, Grand
894000	895000	Theft Auto Vices.
895000	896500	Have you played Resistance online?
896500	899420	I haven't played it online yet.
899420	903940	I'm looking forward to doing that, but I've been too busy playing the story mode in it,
903940	906580	and I love the story mode.
906580	910620	Even with no achievements to unlock, this is amazing to me.
910620	913840	The thing that's kind of cool about those, they sort of have an achievement system for
913840	914840	that one game.
914840	919040	You unlock these skill points, they call them, and it actually unlocks different things like
919040	920380	costumes and stuff.
920380	923260	So like in Excite Truck and Burnout, you get trophies.
923260	927660	Yeah, something like that, but what's kind of neat though is when you play through the
927660	931540	whole game, it unlocks more weapons, and you can go back and play through again, and then
931540	936900	you can unlock harder difficulties and stuff, and you get more skins for multiplayer.
936900	940740	But I do want to try out 40 player multiplayer online with that.
940740	942740	I think that'd be crazy.
942740	946100	Alright, is that it for your gaming week?
946100	947100	That is it.
947100	951580	Oh, and by the way, just real quick, real quick, Playstation 3, their download thing,
951580	954740	okay, fucking sucks, balls, okay?
954740	959680	The fact that it takes like an hour to download something, and you can't do anything while
959680	964300	it's downloading, that fucking sucks, and they need to fix that, okay, now I'm done.
964300	969460	Quick comment on the Playstation 3 from Jared Joe in chat, I love the potential of my PS3
969460	973940	so far, I can't wait for it to unleash itself, I have Resistance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance,
973940	975520	and both of those games are fantastic.
975520	981540	I had Genji, notice I said I had Genji, so, couldn't stand the enemy crabs, I'm sure.
981540	983660	I have the demo, but I haven't played it yet.
983660	988540	Alright, my gaming week, okay, when I sat down a couple weeks ago to think about my
988540	994360	top ten games of 2006, I came to the realization that Oblivion really was probably, I think,
994360	998180	the second best game of 2006, I did name Zelda Twilight Princess number one, but I really
998180	1003260	thought Oblivion was number two, but then I realized, like, I hadn't really fully immersed
1003260	1008540	myself into Oblivion, I'm not sure why, like I played it, and I kind of did the whole sandbox
1008540	1011500	thing, but I just kind of always fucked around in that game, I never really sat down and
1011500	1015820	played the story, oh my god, I have wasted so much time on Oblivion this week, it's not
1015820	1020780	even funny, like, I allowed myself to totally get immersed in it, and just, oh my heck,
1020780	1024920	I think I'm like six months late from everybody else, but I can't stop playing it, it's crazy.
1024920	1029260	I haven't sold mine back yet, but that's because I like going in every now and then, punching
1029260	1031460	animals, that's just me.
1031460	1035300	It's fun to just sign on once in a while, and I say sign on because the game to me,
1035300	1039980	it really feels like an MMO, just with the people acting like real people, it's crazy,
1039980	1044500	it's so weird, it would be really interesting if Bethesda made an Elder Scrolls MMO, that
1044500	1047540	would be craziness, I don't know, it would be very interesting.
1047540	1052140	Anyway, so Oblivion, hours and hours sucked into that game this week, because I'm just
1052140	1058500	a late bloomer in that regard, but I played Halo 2 of all things, some of my college buddies,
1058500	1062760	way back in the day, like when we were all at college, I was off at Chico and they were
1062760	1069560	at Sonoma State, we used to sign online and play Quake over the modem every week, once
1069560	1074140	a week we played Quake, and we decided to try and bring that back a little bit and be
1074140	1078180	in touch, because now we live all over, my buddy Garret is in town, but Bill's off in
1078180	1082540	New York City, and Matt's all traveling around the world, so we kind of tried to connect
1082540	1084900	through Xbox Live, so we played Halo this week.
1084900	1089300	But what's really funny, well Halo 2, we were playing Halo 2 online, we all suck at it,
1089300	1092780	but that's the fun part of it, when you're playing against other people who suck at Halo,
1092780	1093780	it's pretty fun.
1093780	1098700	But what's really funny about what happened during it is that we left it on so that anybody
1098700	1102660	from our friends list could join the game, and somebody that joined the game was gamer
1102660	1108980	Andy, because he has his site, gamerandy.com, and he was signing on to say, I'm sorry, because
1108980	1111900	he got an invite to the New Year's show, but just scheduling conflicts, he wasn't able
1111900	1115620	to make it on, so he was coming on to say, sorry, I couldn't make it, we'll have to make
1115620	1118340	up, and we'll definitely have him on the show some other time, because he's a really cool
1118340	1124620	guy, but oh my god, he kicked all our asses horribly at Halo, he's like, oh, I'm not any
1124620	1128900	good, he's very humble, he's like, I haven't played in a year and a half, I suck at Halo,
1128900	1130500	and he just wiped all of us.
1130500	1133300	My friend Matt's pretty good, so he was giving him some competition, but we, oh god.
1133300	1138540	I really need to buy Halo 2, because, you know, I have, I think it was fun when I played,
1138540	1143660	you know, briefly, a long time ago, but I really, I'm not that great at first person
1143660	1149180	shooters sometimes, I mean, when we're playing Call of Duty 3, all we played out is rocket
1149180	1150580	launchers, sniper rifles.
1150580	1153100	Yeah, that's actually what we were playing was the rockets, and that game was kind of
1153100	1155940	fun, because that's easy to kill someone in rockets, so.
1155940	1158940	Yeah, but, yeah, just rockets and just sniper rifles.
1158940	1163740	Can we form a clan for, like, I suck at Halo, I mean, I realize we have the OL Army, but
1163740	1167580	I, there's actually good players in the OL Army, we have some people that are, like,
1167580	1170660	level 21, can we get, like, level 1 for life, Joe?
1170660	1176060	Dude, I suck completely, I suck ass at Halo, so.
1176060	1178660	When Halo 3 comes out, I'm scared, I'm seriously scared.
1178660	1180420	We'll just play, because I'll buy Halo 3.
1180420	1181420	Okay, there you go.
1181420	1185060	I'm getting a legendary edition, so I have a helmet at my desk, but that's about it.
1185060	1189060	And then otherwise, I haven't been playing a lot, I mean, the arcade, of course, DDR
1189060	1193580	and stuff, but otherwise, I got, oh, I got 200 of 200 achievement points in New Rally
1193580	1196380	X, thank you very much.
1196380	1200940	Which is sadly the first arcade game I've gotten all the achievement points on, and
1200940	1204660	I'm the only one on my friends list that has played the damn game, and I know that because
1204660	1208100	I'm the only one with a high score on the list, and I have, like, 70-something friends
1208100	1211980	on Xbox Live and not a damn other person's played the game except me.
1211980	1217500	But you know what, the only reason I bought it, I remember from my childhood, okay, so
1217500	1218500	don't hate.
1218500	1219980	I remember Rally X in the good old days.
1219980	1220980	Now that you're an old man.
1220980	1221980	I know.
1221980	1226740	All right, let's get into some housekeeping for tonight real quick, since we're done with
1226740	1228140	our gaming week.
1228140	1233140	DMN over from STFU, our Thursday night program on Orange Launch Radio, wanted me to mention,
1233140	1236140	they're going to have the dude from VG Cats on this week.
1236140	1237140	Lucky bastard.
1237140	1238140	How are they?
1238140	1241740	Their show's like five weeks old, and they're already landing these people.
1241740	1244540	We've been around for five fucking years, and people are like, who are you?
1244540	1246620	Why should I come on your program?
1246620	1251100	What's Orange Lounge have to do with video games?
1251100	1254140	So I say STFU to all of you.
1254140	1257020	Don't forget all our other live programming on Orange Lounge Radio again, and of course
1257020	1260220	we wanted to say, take a moment to thank, again, all of our New Year's Eve people we
1260220	1261820	had on this week.
1261820	1267300	We hope to incorporate guests, not just from the gaming industry, but other gaming podcasts
1267300	1269180	and people you see out there in the gaming media.
1269180	1273100	We're trying to think of ways to incorporate that on into 2007, because the New Year's
1273100	1277360	episodes seem to be really well received, and you guys seem to dig that, so definitely
1277360	1279580	we'll do stuff more like that in the future.
1279580	1280580	It was cool.
1280580	1281580	Good times.
1281580	1282580	All right, how about some gaming news?
1282580	1284140	Let's talk some smack about some gaming news.
1284140	1285980	Loki, start us off.
1285980	1292460	Well, apparently there's a small little convention going on called CES, Consumer Electronics
1292460	1297740	Show, that I completely forgot about, and I was like, oh yeah, CES is going on.
1297740	1303620	Anyways, so I'm kind of, you know, starting that all off, there's been some rumors coming
1303620	1312860	out about a brand new version of the Xbox 360, now with HDMI, codenamed the Zephyr,
1312860	1316740	and apparently there's been shots floating around from Engadget.
1316740	1323900	I know there was some video on there from Xbox scene, so definitely something that's
1323900	1328380	probably going to be out there at some point, although a lot of people are bitching, saying,
1328380	1330220	oh, what about the early adopters?
1330220	1335100	You screwed all them, but you know, I'm just like, I don't need HDMI.
1335100	1336100	Whatever.
1336100	1337100	My TV doesn't have HDMI.
1337100	1338620	What, Nintendo does this shit all the time?
1338620	1339620	No one seems to mind.
1339620	1340620	Yeah, exactly.
1340620	1345580	I mean, seriously, I mean, you know, with the DS Lite, I mean, sure, my panties were
1345580	1349380	ruffled a little bit at the fact that, you know, the DS Lite comes out not even like
1349380	1353380	a year after the DS is already on shelves and I bought the first printing of the DS,
1353380	1354380	but what can you do?
1354380	1355780	I mean, this thing is inevitable.
1355780	1359180	Yeah, really, I mean, for me, it's not a big deal.
1359180	1364300	I mean, I guess later on down the line, if I really had an issue with this, I can just,
1364300	1370180	I guess, buy another one or something, but I don't know, my TV doesn't have HDMI, so
1370180	1371180	it's no good for me.
1371180	1376500	I think my TV does, but, you know, I go back and I think about how long I was like, I have
1376500	1379980	to get a component cable for the Wii, I have to get a component cable, I have to have like
1379980	1382980	the best video ever, and then it really wasn't that big a difference.
1382980	1387980	So I think like, is it really going to be a deal breaker that I can't, I don't get HDMI
1387980	1388980	right away?
1388980	1395260	I mean, chances are my 360 will break eventually anyway and I have to get a new one, so I'll
1395260	1396820	just wait for that inevitability.
1396820	1402260	Exactly, and a lot of people are saying also that the new 360 is going to, and I don't
1402260	1406180	even know where they're pulling this info from, I mean, because I believe the HDMI part
1406180	1409580	because we've seen pictures of it, but they're saying, oh, it's going to have a 120 gig hard
1409580	1416940	drive and all this stuff, and the, you know, it's going to have the, you know, 65 nanometer
1416940	1420380	chip sets in there and stuff.
1420380	1425420	You know, really, the 120 gig hard drive will be something that they add on later.
1425420	1429860	I mean, that's something that they'll have, you know, the offer that you can buy.
1429860	1432500	It's not going to be probably included with this.
1432500	1435060	I mean, I don't know.
1435060	1438180	To be honest, all I think they're going to do is add this HDMI port.
1438180	1442260	It's not going to be a brand new model of the 360, it's just going to be, now the 360s
1442260	1445020	are coming out with HDMI ports on them.
1445020	1446260	That is it.
1446260	1450420	And they'll have the, you know, cooler processor in there, so, you know, lower the cost of
1450420	1455180	the system, but I don't think they're going to do anything above and beyond this.
1455180	1458980	The O, they could prove me wrong because I know there is one thing actually that's coming
1458980	1466140	out of CS that they're talking about using the 360 as an ITV box, so that's going to
1466140	1468300	be some stuff that's going to come out this week.
1468300	1474380	Or they're talking about to be able to use it to watch web TV, so that's interesting.
1474380	1478700	But I don't know, it's just, I don't think they're really going to try to do anything
1478700	1479700	different.
1479700	1483740	And also the other rumor was HD DVD drive built in, which I don't, that's not going
1483740	1484740	to happen.
1484740	1489660	I don't know, it's not a huge deal, I think, for me.
1489660	1494620	And all those people that are really HDMI was important or something, buy a new system.
1494620	1498500	Know your old one off, people will buy it, just buy a new system, I mean, just quit your
1498500	1499500	bitching.
1499500	1504860	Comments from our chat room, DDR Dollar Bill says, HDMI, don't care.
1504860	1510740	Let's see, we have, I believe it was Paradox Vincent said, DS Fat sucks.
1510740	1516420	And NM64 says, DS Lite is only worth it if you need a new DS or never had one.
1516420	1517940	So some conflicting opinions there.
1517940	1518940	I think the fat is fine.
1518940	1522700	Did you know the DS fat is actually louder than the DS Lite, which is good for games
1522700	1527100	like Elite Beat Agents and stuff when you need to drown other people out?
1527100	1531780	But I do think overall I kind of prefer the Lite, and I'll probably get one eventually.
1531780	1536580	But knowing Nintendo, there'll be some new color or some new redo they're going to do
1536580	1540200	before the span of the DS Lite, or the DS in general, is over.
1540200	1541200	So I'm waiting for that.
1541200	1542980	Just like when the Game Boy Advance came out.
1542980	1547680	I had the Game Boy Advance, the original one, and then they did the SP, and you know, fuck
1547680	1548680	that shit.
1548680	1550300	I am not buying another system all over again.
1550300	1553300	Nintendo has done this with almost every single one of their consoles, I think.
1553300	1554300	Remember the Nintendo?
1554300	1559660	They did the top-loading one that looked like the Famicom later on, and then with, well
1559660	1565040	I guess not really the Nintendo 64 or the Super Nintendo, but the 64 they had a rumble
1565040	1567900	later on, and then you could add the RAM pack later on.
1567900	1569420	Oh, and they had the Pokemon 64.
1569420	1570420	Yeah, exactly.
1570420	1571640	The Pokemon 64.
1571640	1573020	They always try to pull this shit.
1573020	1574620	With the little cheek slide up when you turn it on too.
1574620	1577900	And don't think that they don't know that later on, you know, people are going to buy
1577900	1581020	an extra DS because it's in a specific color.
1581020	1585900	I mean, come on, it doesn't, it's not that hard to manufacture the DS in a different
1585900	1586900	color.
1586900	1588580	Ooh, ooh, I just thought though, Microsoft does that too.
1588580	1589580	They've done it before.
1589580	1591000	You know what kind of Xbox I have?
1591000	1592000	I don't have them.
1592000	1593000	Yeah.
1593000	1594000	I don't have the same Xbox most people have.
1594000	1595000	I have a Halo Xbox.
1595000	1596000	That's the see-through green.
1596000	1597000	I have a Halo Xbox.
1597000	1598000	That's the see-through green.
1598000	1599240	Yeah, but most people don't have that though.
1599240	1601700	Most people have the big black brick, right?
1601700	1603400	My big black brick died.
1603400	1605820	Microsoft is not beyond redesigning their consoles.
1605820	1606820	Exactly.
1606820	1610900	Don't you think there will be a Halo 3 limited edition console, or do you think there will
1610900	1611900	just be a faceplate?
1611900	1615100	They can get it too, back with the Sega support streamcast.
1615100	1617060	I think the faceplates are what they're doing now.
1617060	1622020	That's a big thing, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a black console later, you know.
1622020	1625340	I think that's something that's very possible.
1625340	1626340	I don't know.
1626340	1627500	We all know the Wii colors are coming.
1627500	1628500	It's just a matter of time.
1628500	1629500	Oh, yeah, yeah.
1629500	1630500	Those are coming.
1630500	1631500	Same with the PlayStation 3 colors.
1631500	1632500	You're going to see those as well.
1632500	1633500	I mean, come on.
1633500	1636780	It's just, this is not, I mean, look at the PlayStation 2.
1636780	1639780	They have silver, pink, I mean, come on.
1639780	1640780	It's just, everybody does it.
1640780	1643580	Because I need something to match my cabinet that I got at IKEA.
1643580	1647500	Like, oh my God, I got to totally get a pink one for my girlfriend because she's going
1647500	1648500	to totally appreciate it.
1648500	1651260	And when you give it to her, she's like, wow, this is so pretty.
1651260	1657460	What the fuck am I going to play on it?
1657460	1659980	You know why they keep doing this, you guys?
1659980	1663980	It's because people are retarded and they will buy this shit.
1663980	1666660	They will buy a blue DS when it comes out because it's blue.
1666660	1670020	They'll buy a pink DS when it comes out because it's pink.
1670020	1672940	Because people are retarded and they don't understand there's websites out there that
1672940	1679100	make custom colored DS's that you can order brand new in any fucking color of the rainbow
1679100	1684300	that you want instead of having to wait for Nintendo to put it out.
1684300	1687740	You know, there's a conversation going on in chat right now that has me thinking a little
1687740	1688740	bit.
1688740	1692940	Do you think, do you think the black Wii will be a little bit bigger than the white Wii?
1692940	1696780	Yeah, and the yellow Wii is going to be super tiny.
1696780	1699180	Yeah, okay.
1699180	1701860	You can address those cards and letters to lowkey at orangelawnsradio.com.
1701860	1704740	Hey, you started it, okay.
1704740	1707660	Let's just move right along to talking about Halo 3.
1707660	1710180	Of course, we were talking about that a little bit.
1710180	1711640	And the beta testing, right?
1711640	1714580	You had everybody slam that site, try to get into the beta test.
1714580	1717380	And you'll find out this month if you got into the beta test.
1717380	1722780	But if you didn't get in that way, there is the rule of three.
1722780	1727860	And I don't know why else you would call it that unless you want people to say the rule
1727860	1734300	of three, the mysterious rule of three to get into the Halo 3 beta test.
1734300	1739340	What's going to happen is that if you play three hours worth of Halo 2 multiplayer between
1739340	1745940	Thursday the 1st of February and February 3rd, 2007, if you're among one of the first
1745940	1752780	13,333 to register at Halo3.com right after that, then you will be part of the Halo 3
1752780	1753780	beta.
1753780	1754780	The other way to get into it?
1754780	1755780	Buy Crackdown.
1755780	1758340	I just buy Crackdown.
1758340	1762020	I have to be honest, I'm kind of not caring anymore.
1762020	1767100	Like I know I should think this Halo 3 beta is a big deal and OMG I can be the first on
1767100	1768100	my block to play it.
1768100	1772200	But now I'm to the point where I'm like, you know what, I'll just play the damn thing.
1772200	1776700	It's going to be buggy, people are going to bitch, I'll just wait for it to...
1776700	1780100	It was cool when it was like a beta thing and you didn't know how many people were going
1780100	1784460	to get into it and you thought, oh hey, this is going to be only a couple thousand.
1784460	1786820	That's kind of cool, you're like in the cool club now.
1786820	1791260	Now where it's, oh anyone that buys this game will get into the beta, oh and this is another
1791260	1793260	way to get into the beta.
1793260	1800700	Why the fuck is a beta test like fucking incentive to buy something or do something?
1800700	1804560	You're beta testing something and you don't realize that's actually work.
1804560	1811420	You're working, I mean you're playing a game to find bugs, that's not exactly fun.
1811420	1817460	Just wait, people, it's only a few more months away, shit.
1817460	1821460	I don't know, I'm kind of over it, I'll play it when I play it.
1821460	1824580	I don't have to be the first kid on the block to do it.
1824580	1828660	Somebody in chat, who said this, said that it would probably fill up within five hours.
1828660	1832820	Mike W. says that he predicts right here and now that the beta will fill up in five hours.
1832820	1834820	I give it three.
1834820	1840020	People will be on their consoles one minute after, play the three hours back to back to
1840020	1842020	back and then be on Halo 3 immediately.
1842020	1844620	There will be 13,333 people to do that.
1844620	1848260	So I don't know why Microsoft bothered to make such a big window, seriously.
1848260	1851540	I'm just going to buy Crackdown and play Crackdown.
1851540	1855660	I'm telling you right now, if you want to get in that way, if you're not on there at
1855660	1858900	midnight ready to play until 3am, forget it, write it off, you're not getting in.
1858900	1863060	I'm sorry, you know that's how it's going to work.
1863060	1864060	You know it.
1864060	1867220	There's some people who got to play it anyway.
1867220	1868220	Oh, oh really?
1868220	1869220	Yep.
1869220	1870220	Oh really?
1870220	1871220	Yep.
1871220	1872220	Who?
1872220	1873220	Let's beat them up, take their lunch money.
1873220	1875980	I think they could actually beat anyone of us.
1875980	1877460	Oh really?
1877460	1882460	Bungie actually flew over copies of the beta to the troops overseas.
1882460	1884900	Oh yeah, they probably could keep my SCM.
1884900	1885900	Yeah.
1885900	1886900	Nevermind.
1886900	1887900	Hearts.
1887900	1893140	And basically let them have the free demo for Christmas, give it a try and I think that's
1893140	1894140	pretty cool.
1894140	1895140	That's kind of neat.
1895140	1900600	That's something kind of different and I think a very interesting way and I bet you a lot
1900600	1905580	of our troops are kind of into Halo 2 and 3 and all that stuff so I think that's kind
1905580	1906580	of cool.
1906580	1910900	And it's a good way I think to relieve some of the stress of having to be there.
1910900	1912340	I think it was a really good thing.
1912340	1913340	Yeah.
1913340	1914340	That's neat.
1914340	1915340	Yeah.
1915340	1916340	Good job Bungie.
1916340	1920300	Anyways, so more stuff for the 360.
1920300	1925500	You know how they always have themes and stuff on Xbox Live and you know they're so wonderful
1925500	1928820	how they don't show you what they look like before you buy them.
1928820	1934780	Well thankfully there is a website now that will show you what they look like called DashboardThemes.com
1934780	1940420	and you can go there before you buy a theme and check out what it looks like and possibly
1940420	1943380	save your Xbox Live points.
1943380	1948580	Unfortunately I would just save your Xbox Live points or the other thing you can do
1948580	1953140	if you have a memory unit just go to your local game store or whatever that has an Xbox
1953140	1959140	360 kiosk and download some of that shit for free because lots of it you pay for online
1959140	1961620	you can download for free from there.
1961620	1965740	Although from what I remember reading on this site the people were putting it together with
1965740	1967180	their own money.
1967180	1972580	So you know they do deserve some type of you know medallion or recognition from the community
1972580	1977740	for putting together that public service because for whatever reason Microsoft isn't on top
1977740	1978740	of it with their previews.
1978740	1983280	I mean you can preview some stuff on Xbox.com to be fair but they're not very current and
1983280	1986140	these guys you know they have it the day it comes out.
1986140	1990500	So I think they deserve a round of applause from the gaming community.
1990500	1991500	Yay.
1991500	1992500	Alright.
1992500	1997100	Well, other surprises that you might find.
1997100	2002080	What's interesting is that this 14 year old boy who lives in Utah claims that he purchased
2002080	2008820	a factory sealed copy of Madden 07 for the Xbox 360 and he put the disc in his system
2008820	2014060	and up came not John Madden but hardcore pornography.
2014060	2015780	That's a roster update.
2015780	2021500	The boy immediately notified his parents and they're backing up the claim and said this
2021500	2022560	is legit.
2022560	2029260	Now Electronic Arts was contacted and they're working with the store that the game was bought
2029260	2033340	from to see if maybe something funny went on here like maybe a disgruntled employee
2033340	2037700	put some porn in there you know because how easy would it be to print out a Madden label
2037700	2040900	like on your computer and then take a porn disc and like put it on there.
2040900	2046100	It's a little harder because those are actually you know silkscreened onto the discs so.
2046100	2053100	Yeah but if you're 14 and you don't know to look for that kind of stuff I mean don't you
2053100	2055340	think someone could get away with that?
2055340	2058760	You'd have to be pretty retarded although he does look pretty retarded.
2058760	2059760	You're nice.
2059760	2065020	You would have to be pretty retarded if you're a 14 year old boy and you get porn and go
2065020	2066020	tell your parents.
2066020	2070240	What problem did I know I got porn?
2070240	2071240	Fuck that shit.
2071240	2072900	You're hoarding that shit.
2072900	2074900	You are putting that in the safest spot.
2074900	2078960	That's like someone giving you diamonds you're like fuck that shit I'm going to hide this
2078960	2079960	shit and no one.
2079960	2080960	I'm playing Madden.
2080960	2081960	Go away!
2081960	2086660	Keep the door shut I'm playing Madden.
2086660	2090340	Inviting all your friends over to play Madden.
2090340	2093740	Building a shrine to the Madden disc in your bedroom.
2093740	2094740	That's beautiful.
2094740	2098100	Carol dude you're going to see the coolest copy of Madden you've ever seen.
2098100	2105340	EA would quote regrets any embarrassment the matter has caused the family.
2105340	2107440	That's a way to learn a lesson early.
2107440	2109960	By the way one other quote that's so great here.
2109960	2114780	According to a paper in Utah the standard examiner when Mahoney looked at the pornographic
2114780	2119740	images his first thought was quote this is definitely not Madden.
2119740	2127220	No it's NHL 2000 on Dreamcast.
2127220	2129340	This looks more like Blitz League what the fuck.
2129340	2135420	Listen up 2K if you want to win this war going on in the football world here's how to do
2135420	2136420	it.
2136420	2137420	More porn.
2137420	2143580	Listen you don't need that's what they need to do NFL xxx just like BMX xxx except it
2143580	2145620	doesn't have any NFL in it it's more porn.
2145620	2150460	Okay very interesting Jeremy Todd one says Loki wouldn't you rather sue the game company
2150460	2153500	and get millions rather than keep some porn you can find for free.
2153500	2158100	You're 14 your parents are going to get that money fuck that shit keep the porn.
2158100	2165780	Ravens Dolphin one said I found porn on my PSP memory card from EB I told nobody.
2165780	2168060	Yeah was it a used game or a new one?
2168060	2172300	It's a used game oh that game that was a new factory sealed game.
2172300	2173300	That's fun.
2173300	2179600	Fireboma says he notified his parents quote under long review this is porn quote hold
2179600	2185060	on we have to go review got to go to the bathroom.
2185060	2189500	Well speaking of something that has nothing to do with porn okay it might have been but
2189500	2191700	that's not official.
2191700	2196340	Guess who's leaving rare for more porn I mean for for not porn.
2196340	2198140	The Pinatas.
2198140	2201580	The Stamper brothers are leaving leaving rare.
2201580	2206860	Wait didn't they like found it or something yep they were one of the well I guess two
2206860	2213700	of the main folks behind rare and now they're gone by that they've gone to a quote pursue
2213700	2214700	other opportunities.
2214700	2219580	They're like they're all fuck this shit we make no more fucking pinata games fuck this
2219580	2220780	we want killer instinct.
2220780	2224780	Well wait wait a damn minute though Viva Pinata was the best thing rares put out in a while
2224780	2229260	sadly they did put out didn't they.
2229260	2234460	We promise just make a pinata game and we'll let you make killer instinct.
2234460	2239300	What I want to know is what if Viva Pinata was not that bad I mean it's actually quite
2239300	2243420	good it's a pleasant surprise of a game so don't knock it till you've tried it it's pretty
2243420	2244420	fun game.
2244420	2249240	I had way more fun with Viva Pinata than cameo and perfect dark zero combined end of story
2249240	2250240	end of story.
2250240	2251900	Okay well perfect dark zero is like bald.
2251900	2255860	So if that's what yeah I know and I'm like if that's why they left was over Viva Pinata
2255860	2261460	then bye don't let the door hit your ass on the way out but you know I what I want to
2261460	2265860	know was did they leave this voluntary or is this one of those nice ways of saying they
2265860	2270500	were asked to leave because the community was not too receptive to some of the recent
2270500	2274420	games and I don't believe Viva Pinata is performing very well I don't think it's reaching the
2274420	2277540	target audience they want I mean critically it's doing well but that doesn't always translate
2277540	2280960	to money you know what I mean.
2280960	2284460	There's actually an interview but I have to look a little bit more further into that but
2284460	2286020	I think it's willing.
2286020	2289420	Interesting do you think they'll start a rival company?
2289420	2292180	I hope so.
2292180	2296420	They should make one called uncommon.
2296420	2303980	Wonder Dog Harold says they're just taking the money and running.
2303980	2309780	DJ Morpheus says thanks to Viva I can't play my 360 right now and I think that's because
2309780	2313500	I've seen his woman on there playing Viva Pinata non-stop because she's on my friends
2313500	2317220	list and I could be looking at my Xbox friends list at one in the afternoon and look who's
2317220	2318220	online playing Viva Pinata.
2318220	2322300	You know what would be hilarious is if you smacked that woman enough times that she like
2322300	2325260	locked up your system for like an hour or something like that.
2325260	2326260	What?
2326260	2329460	No I said that'd be funny if it happened you know in the game where you smack her.
2329460	2334220	Oh I thought you meant Travis's woman I was like that's not nice.
2334220	2336500	Oh you mean the woman in the game?
2336500	2337500	Yeah in the game.
2337500	2338500	No okay yeah yeah.
2338500	2341620	No don't you weren't you there when I played that game the first time and I whacked her
2341620	2344620	with a shovel and she's like you don't want to do that again and so of course what I do
2344620	2348060	I whacked her in the face with a shovel again and she took my shovel away and I was fucked
2348060	2349060	I had to reset the game.
2349060	2353260	You fucking walk up behind her with a brick and smack her in the back of the head.
2353260	2357500	Rama says Sky the Viva Pinata cartoon isn't doing too well either.
2357500	2360620	The cartoon sucks ass I hate that thing.
2360620	2366100	Anyways so one thing that doesn't suck ass is katamari although what does suck ass is
2366100	2371100	that the fact that it's not coming to Xbox Live Arcade apparently that was a rumor that
2371100	2379940	was going around but of course defused by the worldwide Xbox Live Arcade games portfolio
2379940	2387700	manager Ross Erickson who basically said that the rumor is total crap and is not happening.
2387700	2396460	So yeah no katamari but I'm sure we'll see katamari come to the 360 some point.
2396460	2397460	You think?
2397460	2398460	I think so.
2398460	2399460	Really?
2399460	2409300	I don't know yet about what the future has in store for katamari to tell.
2409300	2412420	There's going to be more katamari games they registered trademarks already for them so
2412420	2420620	unless they're going to do some fucking katamari cartoon which would be even more cool.
2420620	2425860	We also have some other interesting rumors going around because the katamari thing started
2425860	2426860	as a rumor.
2426860	2431620	Well now they're saying that radiant silver gun 3 there was a report earlier this week
2431620	2437300	that radiant silver gun 3 was going to be on the Xbox 360.
2437300	2441820	Also knights is going to be coming to the Wii that would be very interesting knights
2441820	2442820	coming to the Wii.
2442820	2443820	Knights on the Wii would be fun.
2443820	2450220	Of course the radiant silver gun 3 did get basically confirmed not to be happening.
2450220	2454020	Yep unfortunately there was a follow up a little later in the week where treasure was
2454020	2459260	giving an interview about what's going on and unfortunately they denied the existence
2459260	2462020	of radiant silver gun 3.
2462020	2464940	Go cry a little more about that.
2464940	2467100	I would like to see radiant silver gun 3.
2467100	2468660	That's a good shooter.
2468660	2471100	Knights sounds pretty hot though.
2471100	2477020	At least we still have ikoruga that we can play if we want to get our fix.
2477020	2479940	Maybe we can get some virtual console games some old school shooters.
2479940	2481260	I don't know wishful thinking.
2481260	2484580	I'm still hunting down radiant silver gun for the Saturn.
2484580	2491420	Well if you want there's that one game radio allergy which is coming to gamecube and that
2491420	2496980	one is supposed to be a really good shooter kind of like ikoruga that was coming out this
2496980	2498780	month but now it's coming out in April I think.
2498780	2501780	I'm still thinking about getting that dreamcast one that's coming out.
2501780	2503900	Is it new hope or something?
2503900	2506940	My dreamcast is in a box sadly.
2506940	2512900	We used to have ours in an xbox kiosk one of those little demo stations we used to have
2512900	2513900	our dreamcast sitting in one.
2513900	2517900	What ever happened to your demo station you had?
2517900	2519180	How much does those things sell for?
2519180	2521620	I have no idea what we got for it.
2521620	2522780	Really what how much lucky?
2522780	2524860	They're like $500 and not more.
2524860	2527020	Were you looking at that on ebay or something?
2527020	2529100	I was for a customer they wanted to bring.
2529100	2534620	You know those things are so hard to get like for even like microsoft for example in order
2534620	2538900	to get a kiosk into your store you have to be buying lots of microsoft product and then
2538900	2543580	you get the privilege of buying one from them for like a couple grand it's like thank you
2543580	2547860	for giving me the privilege to buy one from you you fucking douche when I'm trying to
2547860	2553660	push your product you know and you just don't want to give me a kiosk or sell me a kiosk
2553660	2558180	I don't understand it but whatever.
2558180	2565220	We do have some news about a new MMO Battlestar Galactica.
2565220	2572340	It had been reported that it was going to be on Xbox 360 exclusively but Vivendi said
2572340	2579100	uh uh no they said that they actually have not announced a Battlestar Galactica game
2579100	2587220	and they cannot comment any more on it so I guess we don't know.
2587220	2589420	So it's kind of one of those things where it's like it's happening but we're not going
2589420	2591580	to tell you anything else.
2591580	2595300	Well they're saying that they might do it there's a rumor at least that there's going
2595300	2601700	to be a smaller one either for PC or something on Xbox Live Arcade but.
2601700	2606240	I mean like PC is MMO home though it'll be a little silly to not put it out on the PC
2606240	2610900	especially you know when the Xbox 360 is a PC according to you know something I read
2610900	2614460	just before we went live tonight you know according to what Bill Gates the Xbox 360
2614460	2620380	is a PC so it doesn't seem logical to put out Battlestar Galactica only on the 360 when
2620380	2623820	you know there's still the PC market to tap into unless they've signed something with
2623820	2628740	Microsoft and blood you know that there it's an exclusive thing.
2628740	2636620	Anywho, so we got some street dates for you guys and of course like every week we like
2636620	2639940	to bring you some exclusive stuff that you may not have heard.
2639940	2643220	This week I did have a few things on there of course you know being that we put this
2643220	2647980	show out on Sundays you know some of the stuff has come out during the week two of those
2647980	2651340	were brand new Ubisoft games whoopee doo.
2651340	2652340	First one's cause.
2652340	2655260	Hold on hold on I want to say before you start getting this stuff out we have to get a little
2655260	2659540	disclaimer about sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong right because you know
2659540	2660540	that we.
2660540	2661540	Hey listen.
2661540	2662540	New year new show.
2662540	2665260	So sometimes these dates are right sometimes they're wrong why are they wrong sometimes?
2665260	2670660	They're wrong sometimes because they change dates like daily so stuff changes all the
2670660	2677780	time and a company to announce a date initially and have that date stick is like a rarity.
2677780	2682740	This stuff shuffles around and the only reason it shuffles around is development cycles whether
2682740	2689420	they're in behind or headed in development or getting approval from like Sony Microsoft
2689420	2690460	and Nintendo.
2690460	2696380	For instance I just to kind of give an example this week actually I should say a long time
2696380	2700340	ago I want to say it was in like episode 195 or something it was a while ago a long time
2700340	2706680	ago about six months ago you said that Bioshock was coming out in April of 2007.
2706680	2710120	But then this week we heard that there was a 2K games rep that was posting on some forum
2710120	2713120	that said it's coming out in June you heard it here first.
2713120	2716060	So it's kind of like you were in the right ballpark but for whatever reason these developments
2716060	2717060	have got to push out.
2717060	2718060	No they changed it.
2718060	2723180	The same day well actually I think because I don't pay attention to some of these date
2723180	2727220	changes or don't bother repeating them again but like before the guy came out and said
2727220	2732800	oh yeah by the way this is we had a date change to you know the new new date now.
2732800	2738180	So I mean it does it it's just a change at all time it's just like trying to think for
2738180	2743620	example Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the PlayStation 3 first it was going to be a launch title
2743620	2747740	then it was January and then it was February now it's March.
2747740	2752500	So it's like you know some games are just push back and push back and push back.
2752500	2757700	So I mean I try to report them every time I see them change but you know it changes
2757700	2758700	a lot.
2758700	2762620	But what I notice you do get from out of this and you've gotten it right every time I can't
2762620	2766140	think of a time you've ever been wrong on this is when a new title comes in that hasn't
2766140	2770760	been announced yet like you know about Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 six months before anybody
2770760	2772140	ever announced it officially.
2772140	2774300	Whenever these titles drop in there it's always right.
2774300	2775300	And Oblivion.
2775300	2776300	That's what I've noticed.
2776300	2777300	And Oblivion on PSP.
2777300	2778300	That's right I remember that from last year.
2778300	2781340	And Full Auto 2 on PSP.
2781340	2784340	So is there anything in this list that's new that we don't know about yet?
2784340	2785340	Well yes.
2785340	2786340	I do know stuff.
2786340	2794020	Okay first off we mentioned last week driver parallel lines for the PSP which was actually
2794020	2796580	March 14th was when that was coming out.
2796580	2801900	Now it's being changed to driver 76 so because if you remember driver parallel lines start
2801900	2805100	off in 1976 and then it comes in the modern time.
2805100	2809420	So I'm guessing this game is going to be driver parallel lines but just set in 1976.
2809420	2812380	I didn't know that because the driver series sucks.
2812380	2813380	Yeah it does.
2813380	2815880	But that's just happening.
2815880	2818340	However though I do have a date for you this will make you happy.
2818340	2822860	Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3 March 14th as well.
2822860	2827000	And we knew that was coming.
2827000	2831060	Definitely one that was not a big surprise but we don't have a date for that yet.
2831060	2832540	So that's kind of cool.
2832540	2834460	New games though that haven't been announced.
2834460	2839120	Dream Pinball 3D for the Wii coming out October 10th so still weighs off.
2839120	2842620	And not a huge surprise but Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is going to be coming
2842620	2847460	out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii at mandatory movie time.
2847460	2848620	PS2!
2848620	2849620	Not 3.
2849620	2850620	PS2.
2850620	2853500	Not a lot of stuff being developed for PlayStation 3.
2853500	2856340	PlayStation 2 though, lots of stuff.
2856340	2857340	Interesting.
2857340	2862140	And by the way those two Ubisoft games Cosmic Family and Spelling Spree.
2862140	2866860	Cosmic Family I hear is meant for really little kids because I guess it's based off a cartoon
2866860	2873860	series or something like that and then Spelling Spree I'm guessing some sort of DS type of
2873860	2874860	game.
2874860	2879140	It makes me think like Imagine People driving by in their cars rolling down the window and
2879140	2881740	like spelling at them to death.
2881740	2883700	Oh yeah?
2883700	2886900	Well PRICE DIE!
2886900	2890780	Well remember we mentioned last week and I haven't seen this anywhere yet but Driver
2890780	2892020	Parallel Alliance is on the Wii.
2892020	2894740	That was one of the ones that they didn't mention.
2894740	2901740	Not that I really care to play that on the Wii but I'm just saying letting it be known.
2901740	2903740	So you heard it here first.
2903740	2904740	Hopefully.
2904740	2905740	We think.
2905740	2911820	I can't check the whole internet but as far as I'm aware none of the major sites out there.
2911820	2915580	The ones backed by magazines and publishing companies.
2915580	2918420	What about regular release dates for the week?
2918420	2922560	This week of course January is pretty slow as far as stuff coming out.
2922560	2926980	Of course the big game this week is going to be Lost Planet which is coming out on the
2926980	2930900	12th so definitely worth picking up especially if you've played the demo.
2930900	2931900	Debatable.
2931900	2933300	I'm not, I'm passing.
2933300	2934980	I wasn't a fan of the demo sorry.
2934980	2937980	I'm passing too even though I liked it because I have too many things I'm playing right now
2937980	2939900	so that's it.
2939900	2942740	Now PlayStation 2 though not a whole lot coming out.
2942740	2949800	There's Arthur and the Invisibles woohoo and The Shield which sucked ass and was that based
2949800	2950800	on the TV show?
2950800	2951800	Yes.
2951800	2952800	That's interesting.
2952800	2957340	So beyond that there's not a whole lot coming out.
2957340	2962900	I know there's some DS games, new Yu-Gi-Oh game.
2962900	2964940	It's pretty light.
2964940	2968980	Japanese release dates you have a couple big titles coming out.
2968980	2973300	Atsumare Piñata is coming out January 11th 2007 on 360.
2973300	2976460	That's the name of Viva Piñata localized for Japan.
2976460	2983660	For the PlayStation 3 you get NBA 07 over there and by the way they have Enchanted Arm
2983660	2987500	coming out January 25th over in Japan.
2987500	2990900	Just so you know that's coming up a little sooner but that makes sense.
2990900	2996800	Actually they call it Enchant Arm EM over in Japan too and that was released long before
2996800	2999980	it was over here last year on the 360.
2999980	3003180	GT Pro Series coming out for the Nintendo Wii.
3003180	3005800	I recommend you pass on that one.
3005800	3009920	Coming out on January 11th for the PlayStation 2.
3009920	3010960	Not a lot of new stuff.
3010960	3016380	You do get a couple things going into the best series from Koei including Warship Gunner
3016380	3021660	2 and Shin Sangoku Musou 3 Empires and Mushoden.
3021660	3024820	I should note though that.hack//G.U.
3024820	3029100	Volume 3 is out next week so I know a lot of folks are really into.hack//.
3029100	3031500	That's on its way out pretty soon.
3031500	3040700	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Zettai Onkan Training DS and DS Dengeki Bunko Ira
3040700	3047380	no Sora UFO No Natsu is coming out this week January 11th and of course...
3047380	3048380	That's funny.
3048380	3049380	What?
3049380	3053060	I guess UFO of Summer?
3053060	3054060	Well I'm looking here.
3054060	3059460	I'm looking at the box art and once again it's another freaking DS Japan game that has
3059460	3063380	funny looking school girls on the cover, all anime style, and it looks like they're flying
3063380	3064520	a ship.
3064520	3066100	What was the name of the game?
3066100	3071740	DS Dengeki Bunko Ira No Sora UFO No Natsu.
3071740	3072740	Huh.
3072740	3074420	That's what it's called.
3074420	3075420	Okay.
3075420	3076420	Yeah.
3076420	3082380	But probably most people holding out for, oh never mind it's a US release, never mind.
3082380	3085540	I have the sky color.
3085540	3086540	Who cares?
3086540	3087540	Are any of you really going to import it?
3087540	3088540	I didn't think so.
3088540	3089540	I will.
3089540	3093540	Actually, I'm planning on getting, what was that other game that's not coming out, that
3093540	3095740	one that we played for DDR?
3095740	3098180	I'm going to import that.
3098180	3099180	Which one?
3099180	3100180	The...
3100180	3101180	They had the intro.
3101180	3102180	Oh, Oz.
3102180	3103180	Yeah.
3103180	3104180	That's an old game.
3104180	3105180	I know it's old, but I think I'm going to get it.
3105180	3110620	Yeah, we played the Oz song, Polyvostian Dance and Chorus, and we played that today and Jamie
3110620	3111820	was like, I want that game.
3111820	3119420	Well, reading from that title, I think it's Ira of Sky something, summer, whatever.
3119420	3126300	Anyway, we have our UK release dates, if anyone's interested, which I am.
3126300	3128740	On the 12th is pretty much what's coming out.
3128740	3134100	Bionicle Heroes, Children of Mana, both on DS, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition on Xbox
3134100	3143780	360, Tokobot Plus Mysteries of the Karakuri on PS2, and Warioware Smooth Moves on Wii.
3143780	3147860	Yeah, you can't wait for Warioware to come out next...
3147860	3148860	I think it's...
3148860	3149860	That's next week, isn't it?
3149860	3150860	I think it's next week.
3150860	3151860	Yeah.
3151860	3152860	Cool.
3152860	3153860	Yay!
3153860	3154860	New game.
3154860	3155860	Finally.
3155860	3156860	Anyways.
3156860	3157860	One new game, though, that we're probably not going to see, at least I hope that God
3157860	3164100	of War, if you're not going to see this, is a new RPG based on Tingle, that really annoying
3164100	3166420	gay fairy from Wind Waker.
3166420	3169300	Now he hasn't come out yet, it's just people assuming.
3169300	3175220	Okay, flaming gay fairy from Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
3175220	3177380	Not that there's anything wrong with that, Loki.
3177380	3181100	Nothing wrong with that, he's just super homo flaming gay.
3181100	3188060	Anyways, so apparently it's, oh God, it's possibly going to head to the US in 2007.
3188060	3192420	I was going to say, there is no freaking way this game is not coming to the US at this
3192420	3193420	point.
3193420	3196820	If they're going out of their way to put it out in Europe, you know it's coming here.
3196820	3200020	You know it's going to, because the English version will already exist, it's got to come
3200020	3201020	here.
3201020	3202020	What about Mother 3?
3202020	3203020	Didn't that come out in the...
3203020	3204060	I don't think it did come out over there.
3204060	3205660	It came out in Japan, of course.
3205660	3210020	But I thought there was one game that got translated for the UK but never came out over
3210020	3211020	here.
3211020	3213860	That's funny, it's not going to be Tingle RPG, it can't.
3213860	3215420	That was Mother 3.
3215420	3219220	Not with the freaking petition going on and everything.
3219220	3222020	There's people out there that want their tingle.
3222020	3224100	Tingle.
3224100	3225420	You know you're going to want this game, Loki.
3225420	3226420	You're going to buy it.
3226420	3227420	Nellie's going to make you buy it.
3227420	3228420	I'm not buying it.
3228420	3229420	Nellie's going to make you buy it.
3229420	3230420	She will not make me buy this stuff.
3230420	3233860	I will show it to her and then she'll make you buy it.
3233860	3235620	I want to play the Tingle RPG, it'll be fun.
3235620	3237420	Jamie, will you play the Tingle RPG?
3237420	3238420	Maybe.
3238420	3239420	Alright.
3239420	3241220	When I'm out of school.
3241220	3246780	Nm64 would like to point out, Loki, Tingle was in Majora's Mask.
3246780	3251300	JeremyTod1 says, fact, Rob tried to try out for the role of Tingle but Nintendo rejected
3251300	3252300	him.
3252300	3254300	Aw, sad.
3254300	3257460	That is, you know it's true though that I do have this secret desire, I've always wanted
3257460	3259220	to be a voice actor in a game, I think that would be fun.
3259220	3260940	That would be a lot of fun, don't you?
3260940	3262180	A voice actor in a game?
3262180	3263460	Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?
3263460	3266740	Well not Tingle, God no, but you know, something.
3266740	3269700	We could be a soldier that gets shot in Halo 3 or something.
3269700	3272740	I mean, I don't even know what the hell you'd do in that.
3272740	3273740	Oh, Tingle!
3273740	3276500	I'm like, I'll flame that game!
3276500	3280860	Oh my God, Loki, you should do it!
3280860	3284140	I'm not going to be Tingle.
3284140	3288740	I want someone to create a petition right now on that site, whatever that petition site
3288740	3289740	is.
3289740	3290740	Loki for Tingle!
3290740	3292820	Does Tingle have a hag in that game?
3292820	3293820	I don't know.
3293820	3294820	I don't remember.
3294820	3298340	Holy God!
3298340	3303220	Thank you, insider information says, thank God it's not coming.
3303220	3308060	Holy Shonen says, Tingle funny, but I want him dead.
3308060	3311980	I don't think he'd sell well over here, it's too annoying.
3311980	3314860	People will say, fuck this Tingle shit, we want more Zelda.
3314860	3319660	Well something else that won't come out over here is new music games for the PSP.
3319660	3320660	Interesting huh?
3320660	3329220	Sony is denying that a frequency sequel and a new music game called Traxion for the PSP
3329220	3335100	were not denied by them, but apparently Harmonix spoke to IGN recently, and the team behind
3335100	3342100	frequency said, this is what Sony did, Sony denied Traxion and the frequency sequel for
3342100	3343100	the PSP.
3343100	3347740	Traxion was killed months ago, months ago that thing was gone.
3347740	3351100	Harmonix proposed the sequel on the handheld, but Sony said no.
3351100	3355220	On top of that, LucasArts was going to bring that game Traxion, I'm sorry, it was LucasArts
3355220	3359460	not Harmonix bringing Traxion, and that was also axed.
3359460	3365740	I know for a fact, Sony likes to pass on games they should not be passing on.
3365740	3373200	I'm shocked that they would, with all the fear that Red Octane is causing right now
3373200	3380820	with Guitar Hero and everything, I'm shocked that they would deny them to make a music
3380820	3381820	game on the PSP.
3381820	3386020	Especially when you have frickin' Taiko no Tatujin, which is a stupid game.
3386020	3390860	I don't understand Sony's logic with the games they're not allowing through, it doesn't make
3390860	3393300	sense to me at all.
3393300	3398020	Bad move Sony, because you know, if you do this enough times to Harmonix, and Microsoft
3398020	3401820	who's going to probably be a little more welcoming, hey you want to develop for us, yeah great,
3401820	3404580	we want games on the console, you know what, that's where that game's going to end up.
3404580	3409340	And what about, well I guess Luminous isn't really a music game, I don't know.
3409340	3411780	But it has happy music.
3411780	3420020	Well, there is a rumor floating around about another game coming out on Xbox 360 that's,
3420020	3424020	I think it has a little bit to do with the announcement of Virtua Fighter 5 coming out
3424020	3431360	on Xbox 360, but the rumor now is for Tekken 6 on Xbox 360.
3431360	3439260	It was the same person, quote, IG an insider, who was also credited for letting the news
3439260	3446500	out for Virtua Fighter 5, and so if it's out, I mean, it's not like it hasn't been done
3446500	3449380	before, you know, that's come out on a non-Sony system.
3449380	3455060	We've had the Game Boy Advance one, remember Tekken Advance?
3455060	3457180	I try not to.
3457180	3461540	I actually own that game, and I thought it was okay.
3461540	3465580	And then I've got the Blingcast Tekken 3.
3465580	3466580	So...
3466580	3467580	Alright.
3467580	3471700	Are you, what would you think being a Tekken fangirl that you are, what would you think
3471700	3473740	about this coming to the 360?
3473740	3475980	Is that good news, bad news?
3475980	3479560	Because Tekken, I do always kind of put Tekken with Sony.
3479560	3484380	I mean, you know, because think about Sony's version of Soul Calibur 2 had Heihachi as
3484380	3485380	the bonus character.
3485380	3487540	You know, Tekken's always been a very Sony thing.
3487540	3490940	This, the timing and everything of this seems a little fanboy to me.
3490940	3495780	I don't think, I think this is just the negative Sony ball keeps on rolling and people are
3495780	3496780	saying this.
3496780	3497780	I don't think this is legit.
3497780	3501300	There was also, though, them saying, you remember Soul Calibur for the longest time was a Sony
3501300	3502300	exclusive.
3502300	3503300	Mm-hmm.
3503300	3509860	Yeah, we had three releases of Soul Calibur, what was it, Soul Calibur 2 on various systems,
3509860	3513700	each with their own bonus character.
3513700	3516140	I'm not going to say yea or nay, but I don't think it's far-fetched.
3516140	3517140	Alright.
3517140	3521900	Well, it's just there's not a lot, even though, despite what Sony says, oh, we're meeting
3521900	3522900	our numbers.
3522900	3526060	I'm like, yeah, they're lower numbers that they keep saying.
3526060	3528620	The meeting the numbers that they spew out of their ass.
3528620	3532420	Going back to the previous story for a minute, I just want to say, God, I love the chatters.
3532420	3539820	Took not even five minutes and look at this, Ipetitions.com slash petition slash Loki Tingle,
3539820	3545820	all one word, and the petition reads, simply, Loki should be the Tingle in the next Legend
3545820	3546820	of Zelda game.
3546820	3547820	Beautiful.
3547820	3548820	I'm going to sign it right now.
3548820	3552260	I know, I'm going to go sign it as well while the next story is being read.
3552260	3554260	Okie dokie.
3554260	3562300	Anyways, so if you want to get your Tekken fix on the Playstation 3 right now, you can
3562300	3566660	definitely if you're in Japan, because Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection is out there, but if you're
3566660	3573180	in another region, fear not, there is a work around just like they have for the Xbox 360
3573180	3574380	for their demos.
3574380	3576020	You can actually do this.
3576020	3580300	First what you need to do on your Playstation 3 is create a new user account for your Playstation
3580300	3581300	3.
3581300	3584060	It cannot be an existing new or existing user or sub-user.
3584060	3586380	It has to be completely from scratch.
3586380	3592140	Once you've done that, simply enter in all the credit card information and pick the country
3592140	3595700	as Hong Kong and then choose any city.
3595700	3601880	Once you've done all that stuff, what you do is you add money to your account, but you
3601880	3612780	have to do it an amount below $50, and that's $50 I believe in Hong Kong dollars, so roughly
3612780	3617740	add I believe $40 in Hong Kong twice.
3617740	3623840	And once you've done that, I guess that is just under the radar for confirming your address
3623840	3624840	or something like that.
3624840	3631140	Once you've done that, you're able to purchase the Tekken Dark Resurrection game from Japan.
3631140	3633900	You better hurry up and do it now because you know Sony is going to close the loophole
3633900	3636460	on that within days.
3636460	3642020	So if you really want to do that now or just wait for it to come out, because it will come
3642020	3645020	out eventually.
3645020	3650400	Speaking of older titles but things that you can download online, Major Nelson published
3650400	3656300	this week the top Xbox Live games of 2006, and so since we were talking about downloadable
3656300	3659700	titles, we'll talk first about the top arcade titles.
3659700	3665700	So let's talk about the top purchased arcade titles according to Major Nelson's list, starting
3665700	3670020	off with number 20 was Luminous Live, which I thought was kind of low on the list, 19
3670020	3677180	Cloning Clyde, 18 Small Arms, 17 Feeding Frenzy, 16 Bejeweled 2, 15 Texas Hold'em, 14 Zuma,
3677180	3684980	13 Contrast, 12 Smash TV, 11 Bankshot Billiards 2, 10 Frogger, 9 Gauntlet, 8 Galaga, 7 Ultimate
3684980	3696500	Mortal Kombat 3, 6 Doom, 5 Pac-Man, 4 Marble Blast Ultra, 3 Geometry Wars Evolved, 2 Street
3696500	3702140	Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting, and 1 was Uno, which isn't very surprising.
3702140	3710900	Plus it was one of those ones that had porn and stuff, so not a huge surprise.
3710900	3718700	As far as the top Xbox 360 titles, 20 Splinter Cell Double Agent, 19 Battlefield, 18 Tom
3718700	3725380	Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, 17 Need for Speed Most Wanted, 16 Dead Rising, 15 Madden NFL
3725380	3730540	07, 14 Texas Hold'em, 13 Dead or Alive 4, 12 Geometry Wars Evolved, because remember
3730540	3736940	they are counting everything here, 11 Saints Row, 10 EA Sports Fight Night Round, 3, 9
3736940	3744500	Uno, 8 Call of Duty 3, 7 Perfect Dark Zero, 6 Project Gotham Racing 3, 5 Oblivion, 4 Ghost
3744500	3751540	Recon 3, 3 Call of Duty 2, 2 Hexic HD, because it was on all the hard drives, which is surprising
3751540	3755660	because they left that off the arcade titles list, and I thought that was an arcade title,
3755660	3756660	but never mind.
3756660	3762380	And number one, Gears of War, of course, no big surprise there.
3762380	3768460	Alright, well one thing we like to do every week here on Orange Launch Radio is we let
3768460	3772980	Dark Sakura have a moment to surf the web up and down, back and forth, and share with
3772980	3777260	you all the website that she believes was the best one she found all week long.
3777260	3780180	We call it Dark Sakura's Website of the Week.
3780180	3789700	Well, my website of the week goes back to my love of digital art, and this is photoshopsupport.com.
3789700	3798420	Tutorials, tools, resources, there's a good link with lots of brushes, lots of good stuff
3798420	3799420	on it.
3799420	3807500	There's even free stock photos, there's flash resources, Dreamweaver resources, fonts, textures,
3807500	3808500	you name it.
3808500	3811060	That is really, really freaking cool.
3811060	3820780	So I'm going to vote photoshopsupport.com as my website of the week.
3820780	3824780	So surf there right now, one more time Dark Sakura.
3824780	3825780	Photoshopsupport.com.
3825780	3829060	If you can't spell it, I ain't spelling it out for you.
3829060	3830060	There you go.
3830060	3834020	Well, one thing that we're not spelling is lawsuit for-
3834020	3837020	L-A-W-S-U-I-T lawsuit.
3837020	3839180	L-A-W-S-U-I-T-T-E-D.
3839180	3843180	Is this spelled right?
3843180	3849820	So yeah, the lawsuit between OverGuitarHero with, of course, guitars, and between Red
3849820	3855740	Octane, Activision, and the Ant Commandos, well, they've decided to settle.
3855740	3862500	And apparently what's happening now is they're just able to make the guitars, you know, they've
3862500	3868100	kind of buried the hatchet, I guess, and allowing the Ant Commandos to still make their third
3868100	3873220	party guitars, and yeah, that's pretty much it.
3873220	3874620	Everyone's kind of going their own way.
3874620	3879120	Which makes sense, since, well, you know, Red Octane, they fucking made third party
3879120	3884980	guitars for a long time now, I mean, come on, this is like, I don't know, what's-
3884980	3888760	It sounds to me like they kissed a mate up somehow, one way or another.
3888760	3891740	Someone blew somebody, I think.
3891740	3898580	But anyways, yeah, so all that's better now, it doesn't really matter anyways, because
3898580	3901060	if you wanted to wire this guitar, you can always buy the official one, I guess.
3901060	3904740	Did you see the Guitar Hero 2 360 box art?
3904740	3908380	No, I didn't get to pull that up at work, I saw that.
3908380	3911620	I think there's a story coming up on it later in Part B, at least specifically what's
3911620	3914660	in the game, so I won't spoil that, but the box art's very interesting because it's
3914660	3918380	all white, and it's so weird because you're just thinking, you know, you see the Guitar
3918380	3922060	Hero boxes, they're black, but of course, this is more the Xbox 360's color scheme,
3922060	3923060	so it's kind of interesting.
3923060	3925820	They just look different to me.
3925820	3929260	One other thing that looked kind of different to me when I first saw this was the screenshots
3929260	3932060	for SimCity on the DS.
3932060	3935760	Some screenshots were recently leaked to the internet from SimCity DS.
3935760	3940540	What I thought was interesting is that the host of SimCity DS is Will Wright.
3940540	3943820	Even in the Japanese version, there's this little cartoon character of Will Wright that's
3943820	3945040	sort of your guide.
3945040	3949320	I think the mayor in the old school SimCity on Super Nintendo, which is a virtual console
3949320	3953460	game now, Will Wright is kind of performing that role.
3953460	3958540	Now, SimCity DS is not based on the old SimCity, but it looks like it runs on, I think it's
3958540	3960460	either the 2000 or the 3000 engine.
3960460	3964780	I think it's SimCity 3, not 2000.
3964780	3969400	It looks a little too in-depth, or they might have enhanced it a little bit, but either
3969400	3975780	way, it's that more 3D ISO type of view than the old school SimCity was.
3975780	3978680	I was only really a fan of the first SimCity game.
3978680	3984380	I didn't really get into the series after that, but I know it's a very good simulation
3984380	3985780	type game.
3985780	3988700	I would like to see maybe old school Civilization on the DS.
3988700	3989700	I don't know.
3989700	3990700	Maybe.
3990700	3991700	Maybe that's just me.
3991700	3994380	Then again, there was old school Civilization, I think, on the Super Nintendo, and it kind
3994380	3995380	of blew.
3995380	3996380	We'll see.
3996380	4002400	Well, as far as other things that remain to be seen, I don't know how much we're going
4002400	4010700	to agree with this, but Eurogamer posted their top 50 games of 2006, and I've got the top
4010700	4011700	10.
4011700	4015180	So, if anyone would like to know, I'll read them off.
4015180	4016180	Sure.
4016180	4017180	Why not?
4017180	4020260	I guess one more best of 06 list to close us out.
4020260	4028740	Number 10 is Professor Kawashima's Brain Training, How Old Is Your Brain?
4028740	4032220	Number 9 is Wii Sports.
4032220	4033220	Wii Sports is good.
4033220	4034900	Number 8 is Viva Pinata.
4034900	4037700	I guess I need to actually play that, huh?
4037700	4041860	Seven is Gears of War.
4041860	4043940	Six is Lego Star Wars II.
4043940	4050260	Those games are actually pretty fun, but I got really pissed off at the one that came
4050260	4053700	out a year before.
4053700	4057940	Five is Dead Rising, because there's something really awesome about running over zombies
4057940	4061780	with a lawnmower and cutting their heads off with a scythe.
4061780	4064500	Four is Final Fantasy XII.
4064500	4069820	Three is The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which Dan and I are currently playing through.
4069820	4072940	Two is Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
4072940	4076500	And the number one game is...
4076500	4077500	Your mom.
4077500	4078500	Cooking Mama.
4078500	4079500	No, Guitar Hero.
4079500	4080500	Really?
4080500	4081900	Yes, Guitar Hero won number one.
4081900	4084180	Oh, because that just came out in Europe this year.
4084180	4085580	Ah, okay, okay.
4085580	4086580	I can see that.
4086580	4092180	And to quote one of the folks from Eurogamer, Keza says, If you don't like Guitar Hero,
4092180	4094620	you have no soul.
4094620	4098340	I have to admit, though, I'm getting a little burned out on the guitar hero list.
4098340	4100620	I'm a little burned out on it.
4100620	4104860	It's not God's gift to video games like the media is portraying it to be.
4104860	4105860	It's really not.
4105860	4108200	I love Guitar Hero, but I found out I can't play it drunk.
4108200	4112580	I feel like I've been playing music games for years, and not to sound elitist or anything,
4112580	4116740	so I'm sorry if I sound that way, I understand Guitar Hero made the music game genre more
4116740	4117740	accessible.
4117740	4118740	Don't get me wrong.
4118740	4119740	And I do think it's a good game.
4119740	4120820	I think it's a great game, in fact.
4120820	4124980	But I don't think it's like, you know, oh, sound the chorus of angels.
4124980	4128380	Fucking Guitar Freaks 2DX, basically.
4128380	4131100	I feel like I've kind of seen this before.
4131100	4132100	What's so freaking great about it?
4132100	4136620	But I guess it's just that it made it more accessible through the fact that as much as
4136620	4143900	we have loved Konami's Bomani title, they've never really fully been Americanized, if that
4143900	4144900	makes sense.
4144900	4147780	Whenever they try to Americanize them, it doesn't always work, because I think they're
4147780	4154420	letting the Japanese teams Americanize the games, and that doesn't work.
4154420	4157940	Speaking of top tens, I never posted mine to the site, so I'm going to read it for you
4157940	4158940	now.
4158940	4161100	Would you like to know my top ten games of 2006?
4161100	4162100	That's okay.
4162100	4163100	Well, too bad.
4163100	4164860	I'm going to tell you anyway.
4164860	4166180	I did like Eurogamer's List, though.
4166180	4167500	You know why I like Eurogamer's List?
4167500	4172660	Because I like their reviews over there, because, you know, they will tell it like it is over
4172660	4173660	there.
4173660	4174660	So that was interesting to hear that.
4174660	4175660	But now mine.
4175660	4180040	And here's the ones that I thought were the ten best games of 2006.
4180040	4183660	Number ten, I said Sneak King on the 360.
4183660	4187320	And I know you might think I'm crazy, but get this.
4187320	4192500	It was an original title, the game was four bucks, and it was probably better than most
4192500	4195680	of the games that Xbox released in arcade for five or more.
4195680	4198700	So if you think about it, it's one of the best gaming values of the year, and it absolutely
4198700	4200820	deserves recognition.
4200820	4203200	I think it came off better than anyone thought it would.
4203200	4208340	So you know, Sneak King, I know it seems weird to put it on a top ten list, but I felt it
4208340	4211000	needed some type of recognition for kind of what it did.
4211000	4214420	It did something really, really original in many ways.
4214420	4216900	Number nine, I said Phantasy Star Universe.
4216900	4221780	And the reason why I said that is because you have massive replayability over previous
4221780	4223740	versions of Phantasy Star Online in my mind.
4223740	4227420	You have single player mode, and that would be the type of game that usually you'd think
4227420	4232260	would be sold by itself, but on top of that you have the online mode, rationed unlocks
4232260	4236980	that kind of keep the game going, and makes the world ever expanding, keeps online mode
4236980	4237980	fresh.
4237980	4241660	Number eight, I said Kingdom Hearts 2, which I think far too many people overlooked amongst
4241660	4243140	the 2006 releases.
4243140	4247660	It was an epic game in every sense of the word, made improvements to the original, kept
4247660	4251980	a fresh storyline, and even if you consider that some of the old worlds from the first
4251980	4254660	game return, I mean, they kept it fresh.
4254660	4255660	It's amazing.
4255660	4259660	Yes, it has a three hour opening, but the fact that it's got like the year's probably
4259660	4264540	one of the best soundtracks of the year, amazing visuals, and fucking Tron World.
4264540	4265540	Enough said.
4265540	4266540	Tron World.
4266540	4267920	One of the best games of the year.
4267920	4272300	Number seven, I said Trauma Center Second Opinion, because you know, this is proof that
4272300	4275260	games do not have to have great graphics to be fun.
4275260	4279740	It was originally hailed as truly original on the DS, and it really feels like on the
4279740	4284100	Wii, this is how the game always should have been, and it's probably the most grossly
4284100	4286020	underlooked and underrated Wii launch title.
4286020	4288420	It definitely deserved a place in the top ten of the year.
4288420	4291380	Number six, I said New Super Mario Brothers on the DS.
4291380	4295500	Nintendo certainly knows how to milk its retro franchises for all they are worth, but New
4295500	4299360	Super Mario Brothers takes this old formula, gives it a kick in the pants.
4299360	4302100	This is the game people wanted on the GameCube.
4302100	4305100	Everybody wanted to see a game like this on the GameCube, and for whatever reason Nintendo
4305100	4306900	said, now we'll put it on the DS.
4306900	4313540	And it's like, people read our minds and they got it when, you know, we say that the next
4313540	4317140	generation of gaming, you don't have to make everything in 3D.
4317140	4321420	You can make visually appealing 2D games, and New Super Mario Brothers was it.
4321420	4325380	So definitely it was one of the best titles of the year.
4325380	4329940	Number five, I said Dead Rising on the 360, because it's an absolutely original concept
4329940	4332100	for a game that just feels fun.
4332100	4336020	You're running over zombies with a lawnmower, for God's sake.
4336020	4338380	The greatest thing about the game to me is that you just kind of pick it up and have
4338380	4342580	fun with it, and just like any sandbox type game, you can just say screw it to the stories
4342580	4345300	and go decapitate zombies, and it's awesome.
4345300	4348300	Number four would be Final Fantasy XII.
4348300	4352840	The game is not aging at all, it's reinventing itself as many times as Madonna has, having
4352840	4357140	a fresh story, and the battle system is phenomenal.
4357140	4361300	It feels simple in the game's first hours, but as you play more, it gets so engaging,
4361300	4362580	and it's great.
4362580	4368260	16.99 widescreen support in the US helps the game kind of keep up with the next gen of
4368260	4369260	gaming.
4369260	4373460	Unfortunately, I think it was maybe released a little too late for enough people to notice
4373460	4378940	this title, but it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy roleplaying games at all.
4378940	4382040	Number three, I said Elite Beat Agents on the DS.
4382040	4386580	It's probably, honestly, one of the best music video games of all time, period.
4386580	4390020	There's no fancy controller that you have to embarrass yourself with, you just pick
4390020	4394740	up the pen and you go, hilarious cutscenes, diverse soundtrack, it's an awesome game,
4394740	4397260	and it's better than Oh and Don, sorry.
4397260	4401380	Number two, I said Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, simply the good graphics.
4401380	4405860	You go anywhere you want in a huge world, it's so big it's overwhelming, it's phenomenal,
4405860	4410360	and then you have all these downloadable expansions to it that just keep the game freaking going
4410360	4412060	and going and going.
4412060	4413060	It's an incredible achievement.
4413060	4416580	And then, of course, as I said last week, number one would be The Legend of Zelda Twilight
4416580	4418540	Princess.
4418540	4422980	Just the fact that you've got the new Wii controls on it, you have these clever new
4422980	4427100	items added to the Zelda universe to kind of make use of that, and the story elements
4427100	4428100	and everything.
4428100	4431420	It's just a phenomenal title that was well worth the wait.
4431420	4432420	There you have it.
4432420	4434140	Those are my top ten of the year.
4434140	4437420	Anyone else want to expand on what they thought were the best games of the year?
4437420	4441540	I have my top ten list in your email, but I don't know what it was off the top of my
4441540	4442540	head.
4442540	4443540	Let me know what you want real quick.
4443540	4444540	Jamie, anything you want to add?
4444540	4445540	Cookie Mama!
4445540	4453420	Loki, I'll read them off and you can explain your picks if you want.
4453420	4456300	Well, you should read off what I put on there because it was funny.
4456300	4457300	Fine, hold on.
4457300	4458300	Let's see, what do we got?
4458300	4459300	I have...
4459300	4460860	Okay, here we go.
4460860	4462220	Loki picked Final Fantasy XII.
4462220	4464620	This is the number ten best game of the year.
4464620	4467860	I'm sure somewhere in the video game top list guidelines it says we are required to put
4467860	4470260	at least one Final Fantasy game in any top ten list.
4470260	4471820	So this year it's Final Fantasy XII.
4471820	4473940	It's sexy, new, and everyone wants to be it.
4473940	4475300	It'll be its friends.
4475300	4479540	That is until Final Fantasy XIII comes out, all fifty different versions of it.
4479540	4481380	Loki said number nine was Dead Rising.
4481380	4484380	Dawn of the Dead, the game, I mean Dead Rising was pretty awesome.
4484380	4488640	Although I wish the save system wasn't thought up by brainless zombies.
4488640	4491780	Loki said the number eight game of 2006 was Call of Duty 3.
4491780	4494980	Call of Duty 2 was an incredible game and this one only improves on the formula even
4494980	4496720	better if you have surround sound.
4496720	4501180	Loki said the number seven game of the year was New Super Mario Bros.
4501180	4503460	I think these are in no particular order also.
4503460	4504460	Oh really?
4504460	4505460	It's just my top ten.
4505460	4506460	Oh, well too bad.
4506460	4507540	I'm assuming this is the order.
4507540	4511180	I didn't realize Super Mario Bros. 3 and a half could be so much fun.
4511180	4513700	I guess you can't beat the old 2D platformer days.
4513700	4516660	I just hope we get some more like this on every system.
4516660	4521900	Number six was Gears of War, the killer app before Halo 3, a very intense and albeit hard
4521900	4522900	game.
4522900	4524180	Number five was Twilight Princess.
4524180	4525740	We've waited so long for New Zelda.
4525740	4528700	It's everything we could have wanted.
4528700	4530940	Number four was Excite Truck.
4530940	4532780	I guess that's why you said this is in no order.
4532780	4537020	Who in their right mind would put Excite Truck above Twilight Princess, you idiot?
4537020	4538020	Me?
4538020	4539460	Okay, now read.
4539460	4543920	It looks like Nintendo's BEA to the punch for a burnout off-road, a great launch game
4543920	4548620	for the Wii that converted at least two non-gamers, my wife and extrovert, into full-fledged gamers.
4548620	4551460	All right, that's a good point, good point.
4551460	4553520	Number three, Saints Row.
4553520	4555660	It's like Grand Theft Auto three and a half.
4555660	4559820	I spent countless lunches hurling grenades and rockets at cops while speeding away on
4559820	4560980	my riced-out minifan.
4560980	4565260	I'll be playing this game until Saints Row 2 comes out or Grand Theft Auto 4.
4565260	4569020	According to Loki, the number two best game of the year was Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
4569020	4572620	I have to give props to a game that would let me rob a guild bear, punch a deer, and
4572620	4576740	set fire to civilians in the course of one day and wearing nothing but a loincloth.
4576740	4579420	Well said, well said.
4579420	4583640	And the number one game according to Loki in 2006, and I totally disagree, Grand Theft
4583640	4585860	Auto Vice City Stories.
4585860	4589420	Despite its incredibly flawed targeting system and rather frustrating glitches, Grand Theft
4589420	4593860	Auto Vice City Stories is the most fun you'll ever have on the PSP ad hoc multiplayer.
4593860	4597820	I can only hope that GTA IV is up to this level of fun just for the love of God beta
4597820	4601260	the multiplayer more than five minutes, and I think exactly for those reasons that the
4601260	4605060	fact that it had some bad beta-ing, you should not have put that game anywhere near your
4605060	4606060	top ten.
4606060	4609340	It was in no particular order, that's why I put it there, so whatever.
4609340	4610600	All right, there you go.
4610600	4614700	And then NM64 says, Loki admitted his wife's a gamer.
4614700	4617420	JV Mon says, Rob, I would put Excite Trek before Zelda.
4617420	4620340	I don't know, you guys, it's a good game.
4620340	4625380	I think Excite Trek is horribly underrated, and it probably would be in my top fifteen,
4625380	4629180	but the worst part about Excite Trek is that it was too short.
4629180	4630180	That's it.
4630180	4632380	That was the worst part about it.
4632380	4634740	All right, Jamie has a list she'd like to share.
4634740	4639940	Okay, my number ten is actually DDR Supernova, just because it's bringing DDR back to the
4639940	4644340	arcade, giving everybody what they want, and I think that's a good thing, it's sort of
4644340	4647500	help rebuilding the whole community, and that makes me happy.
4647500	4650580	And nine is the Super Mario Brothers, just because it's Super Mario Brothers, and that
4650580	4652660	game's actually kind of hard.
4652660	4658380	Eight is the Resistance Fall of Man, because it's pretty, and you explode heads and stuff.
4658380	4662220	And I actually like Guitar Hero 2, so it's on there for my number seven.
4662220	4666000	And number six is Trauma Center, because that game's fucking frustrating and evil and has
4666000	4670220	people screaming loudly at their DS's.
4670220	4676020	And then five is Wii Sports, because it's actually kind of fun.
4676020	4677380	Four would be Zelda.
4677380	4680060	Three is Pirates of the Caribbean Pinball.
4680060	4681620	What?
4681620	4683020	Okay.
4683020	4686820	You really thought outside the box for your picks.
4686820	4688860	Well, you are a pinball whore, I'll take it.
4688860	4691380	No, I'm married to a pinball whore, that's a different story.
4691380	4693380	I understand, I understand.
4693380	4696580	Two is going to be all the Flash games on the Doctor Who website.
4696580	4699740	Oh my god, you loser.
4699740	4701460	Your list just lost all credibility.
4701460	4702460	Hey!
4702460	4707940	I like the game where he's the drawing and you have to walk through the thing.
4707940	4708940	Failed.
4708940	4709940	Clank.
4709940	4713500	And one is Cooking Mama, of course.
4713500	4716320	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
4716320	4719700	You're the only gamer girl I can think of that would put Cooking Mama at the top of
4719700	4721600	her list with pride.
4721600	4722600	Very well done.
4722600	4723600	It's great!
4723600	4726200	Cooking Mama is awesome!
4726200	4728980	Next year, her number one game will be Driving Training.
4728980	4729980	What?
4729980	4734260	Because you know, you're a woman.
4734260	4735260	This is good radio.
4735260	4738380	Unless you can't see me flip you off.
4738380	4742900	And on that note, we should probably go to break while Dark Sakura kicks my ass out in
4742900	4744220	the parking lot.
4744220	4751300	So we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio Part B.
4751300	4756020	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
4756020	4757020	a week.
4757020	4761300	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
