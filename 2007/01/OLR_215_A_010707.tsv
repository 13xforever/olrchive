14123	24846	Tonight, January 7th, 2007, Xbox 360 upgrade rumors abound, Nintendo partners with an MMO developer, and prepared to waste even more time with Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
27727	37491	Orange Lounge Radio Welcome back, live listeners, to a new year of Orange Lounge Radio.
37551	41052	We are that radio program on the interweb dedicated...
41574	44277	Video Games, Gamer Culture, and the Gamer Lifestyle
64745	65786	DDR was fun today.
65867	67689	It was good times.
68230	71655	Say hello as well to recently upgraded Techmaster Loki.
72616	74299	Now with more anger and angst.
74659	75060	It's great.
75080	77383	How are you doing?
78044	78785	You going to Macworld?
80206	81348	Oh yeah, totally.
81828	82489	I'm there.
83330	87535	Alright, welcome by the way if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
87575	91059	I know we got some new listeners while we were off on holiday for a little while.
92060	97287	Thanks as well to all the sites that joined us last week for the New Year's Eve special.
98228	100050	And then they turned around and pimped us.
100330	101311	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
129392	134960	DarkSakura, myself, and Loki all met up and we just decided, you know, because DarkSakura and I had kind of known each other a little bit before that.
135821	140847	We were doing another radio program under Station Live and we thought, hey, let's do a show about video games.
140987	141288	Okay.
141448	145173	And then, you know, Loki joined us for that and here we are almost five years later and
145573	146193	Still doing it.
146913	147573	No life.
147793	157195	The show started about music video games, so sometimes you hear Orange Lounge Radio, the Bobani radio station, which, you know, we still love our music-based games, but we like to think that we are gaming fans first.
157215	159876	We just love video games in general, so that's what the show's all about now.
160896	166857	The show we try to present to you guys here every week is that we go over the news, and yeah, you know, we only do a show once a week.
167657	172018	We only do a show once a week, so you're not always going to get the latest and greatest here.
172038	172138	We do...
173098	180021	I have the fortunate luck of having Loki working in the industry in an area that most media doesn't think to look in, which is distribution.
180341	182381	So sometimes we get some pretty good exclusives that way.
182441	191305	But otherwise, you know, we're kind of like we imagine one thing we used to do when we were at the arcades is that, you know, remember when we did like the Wednesday night, we'd get together, play DDR.
191545	192665	And then what do we do afterwards?
192745	195566	We went to Brookfields and just, you know, talk.
196046	197407	Yeah, we nerd.
197467	200528	Well, we ate a lot and then we nerded out talking about stuff.
200808	201711	So that's kind of what we are.
201751	205984	We're the folks sitting around the dinner table at your local diner
206331	210254	Talkin' about games and talkin' smack when appropriate and talkin' about good things.
210575	215139	And we like to invite guests to our table once in a while from the gaming industry, hoping to have some good names on in 2007.
215399	217120	And we like to invite all of you.
217161	218882	We like to fill up the restaurant with our listeners.
219423	225468	We know that the majority of our listeners catch us on the audio blog, also known as podcast, which is released every Monday and Wednesday.
225588	227450	But we also have our live listeners.
227510	233435	We tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on Orange Lounge Radio, orangeloungeradio.com.
233955	235417	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
248972	253395	We have Pump Up the Volume and then something unannounced that we'll be filling in the gaps on Tuesday in the interim.
253856	257859	And then Wednesday nights we have Guys on a Show, which is kind of like pop culture, geek culture stuff.
258139	261341	Thursday nights, STFU, which is really like fast-paced game talk.
261381	262522	It's more like a sports show.
263343	266005	Friday nights we have Club OLR, which is just strictly music.
266045	270568	And by the way, if you missed this week's Club OLR, you did a fantastic job mixing music this week, Loki.
270648	271389	I'm not just saying that.
271429	272169	It was awesome.
272189	272529	I loved it.
272549	273130	I thought it was great.
273390	274650	Would you do a rip-off of something else?
274750	276331	No, no, I didn't rip anything off.
276351	277291	I thought you did a great job.
277991	282073	Maybe you hurried through it or something, but... A little bit of trivia for those folks out there.
283053	287455	LiveWire from the first episode was actually the second episode I did.
287715	289755	And then I flipped them.
290175	290436	I see.
290456	293757	Because I liked one of them better than the other one.
293937	294477	No, I liked it.
294497	294997	I thought it was good.
295720	305666	So, Saturday nights, Travis Donovan Live, Geek, Sci-Fi, Gaming, 360, you know, whatever's on his mind, trying to bring a little dose of reality to you kids.
306066	307226	And, of course, Sunday nights, we're here.
307467	309468	All right, enough plugs for the Sci-Projects.
309488	311649	We want to welcome all of our new and old listeners.
312009	313030	Those have been with us for...
313908	314888	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
314908	315549	What have you been playing?
315569	316169	You made me play DDR.
316189	316609	I did, it was fun.
316669	317209	Yeah, it was.
317269	317949	I played also some...
342838	371441	Beatmania 3 was it the 6th I think yeah 6th mix played some Cooking Mama played some Pinball we got our Whodunit back which is now Trading Potter and I joined Guild Wars this week I didn't really care for it the last time I tried it but I gave it a go this time around it's a lot more fun I don't know if I'm going to stick with it but I figure at the very least if
372210	373391	I pay the money for it.
373491	375893	I can just play it whenever I want and don't have to worry about anything.
376013	377415	So I'm thinking about it.
378556	380437	I've been playing with my friend Heather.
380678	381218	It's pretty cool.
382860	383260	All right.
383480	384241	More Cooking Mama.
384341	385442	Have you beat Cooking Mama yet?
385722	386002	No.
386022	388805	I came this close to buying Cooking Mama, but I'm holding out for the Wii version.
389469	390090	Get them both!
390450	391371	Completion!
391411	393833	And to make a rebuttal to Holy Shonen, I think you're wrong.
412850	413931	What did Holy Shonen say?
413951	415371	World of Warcraft is better than Guild Wars.
416172	418133	World of Warcraft is just more annoying than Guild Wars.
418653	420314	You know, it just kind of depends.
420394	420814	I don't know.
421495	423176	They're almost exactly the same game.
423316	424336	I don't see what the point is.
425097	425657	I don't care.
426378	427478	I'm going to be playing them both.
427598	428779	I understand, because...
429511	443868	Guild Wars you kind of level up to 20 and pretty much the entire game is endgame but World of Warcraft has a little more in the interim because you know you're going all the way to 60 there's a lot more to do in the interim I guess if you're addicted to leveling that's fine but I think that Guild Wars takes a little bit more skill to play I don't know
444209	444489	I don't know.
444509	447790	They're very similar in game structure to me.
447990	448310	I don't know.
448390	450151	I don't really prefer one to the other.
450431	453892	I like the fact that Guild Wars I can go to whenever I want for free, like once I've bought it.
454192	456673	But you know that the game still has not dropped in price.
456713	460474	If you want to get the old school Guild Wars, you have to pay the full $50 for it, which is interesting.
460754	463655	But keep in mind, you say you're paying $9.99 a month for World of Warcraft, right?
463675	464435	Isn't it like $12 or $14.95?
464655	466956	I can't even remember.
466976	467376	Yeah, it's more like $12.
467416	468316	I think Final Fantasy is $12.95 and WoW is like
474954	477476	I can't remember.
477716	483639	You're going to end up paying more in a year for World of Warcraft than you are going to pay for Guild Wars.
486817	490259	I don't know, I did feel like the WoW universe was way more expansive though.
490280	492001	There was a lot more to see in WoW.
492261	495263	But the fundamental difference between the two, here's the fundamental difference between the two.
495703	499566	In Guild Wars, the entire game is what you would call an instance in WoW.
499967	504550	And that's alluring to some people, the fact that they play with exactly who they want and that's it.
504910	506231	GhostSquad is freaking fun as hell.
506251	506851	What are you talking about?
506871	506951	What?
533320	533941	Um, GS68.
534001	535242	I was talking about Ghost Squad.
536063	537904	It's a gun game in the arcades.
538385	539686	That game is freaking hot.
539906	540487	I love that game.
540747	542088	I haven't played a good gun game in a while.
542108	546272	I haven't played it in ages, but Dan and I went and we just freaking played through every mission and it was great.
546472	548514	Every time I want to play Time Crisis 4, somebody's on it.
549275	549515	Oh well.
550316	551657	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
552338	553199	It was pretty good.
553959	555180	Full of lots of stuff.
555581	556482	I got to play Season 3.
556522	556562	Um,
558596	564767	and so I've played lots of Resistance and that game is far better than Gears of War.
565689	571580	I love that game and actually it's very pretty and looking at Resistance
572467	580311	makes you actually kind of question, hey, you know, maybe the PlayStation 3 actually does look better than the 360, and it really looks good.
580451	586593	In fact, I found myself literally, you know, between gunfights, you know, standing there going, wow, this looks really good, you know.
586913	590275	What a fucking change for the year 2007 on this program.
590295	591996	You are gushing about Sony tonight.
592036	593396	What the hell?
593576	594217	No, no, no, hold on.
594237	594757	Is he drinking?
595537	597358	Resistance is good, okay?
597438	598058	Didn't I tell you?
598539	599539	That game is hot.
599679	600439	It's awesome.
600579	601700	But here's the problem, though.
602353	602913	That is it.
604494	606494	Unfortunately, that's all that's out there.
606654	607655	Whoa, back up.
607695	608295	You got a PS3?
608335	609535	Yeah, I got a PS3.
609875	611696	So I'm the only OLR host without a PS3?
611716	613136	Well, I got mine.
613156	617358	I got hooked up, okay, for the PlayStation 3.
617518	620179	I'm the only one without the cool new toys.
620219	620739	Yeah, I know.
620759	621519	God hates me.
621559	622179	Hey, Rob.
622419	622659	What?
622739	623180	Hi.
624060	627641	You're just not part of the PSWe60 club, so...
628863	630584	I heart my Wii 60, screw you!
631205	650406	Anyway, so, no, seriously though, it's fun, it really is fun, and I just, I like it so much better than Gears of War, and the fact, you know, there's so many different difficulties you can play it on, so if you really aren't, you know, hardcore into it and stuff, you can, you know, have a good time with it, so it's very good, I like it.
651795	652335	Ridge Racer 7.
652975	656878	Yes, I bought Ridge Racer 7 because Nelly actually wanted to play it.
657579	661301	And to be honest, I've played it and it's exactly the same as Ridge Racer 6.
661581	663483	It pretty much is.
663823	667485	Well, now you said earlier, though, that you felt Resistance was better than anything you'd see on the 360.
668146	674330	So because Ridge Racer 7 and 6 are so similar, did you think that graphically the PlayStation 3 one was superior?
674390	675531	Because I remember a while back...
675931	676051	No.
676351	679694	Because folks were comparing the two and saying the 360 version looked better.
680775	681896	I shouldn't say the 360 version.
681916	683337	Honestly, I couldn't pick up the differences.
683357	691344	The only difference I saw was when you hit your nitro instead of the screen kind of turning white on the edges, it did this weird blur thing.
692245	693026	But that's about it.
693226	698811	So I do like Ridge Racer 7 on how they have different ways you can customize your cars and stuff.
699091	699912	That's kind of cool.
701173	701593	So, yeah.
702383	705327	Full Auto 2 was another one I picked up on that as well.
705868	707351	I was a huge fan of Full Auto 1.
708112	709734	Which I sold back this week.
709834	712298	Full Auto 2 is okay.
712399	714402	It's just like the first game.
715063	716325	I didn't really notice any changes.
716875	723237	I mean, the graphics look a little different, but it's pretty much the first game all over again, so that's kind of cool.
723537	726478	Let's do some chatroom comments, because the chatroom's on fire tonight.
726498	730859	We've got a lot of new people in chat, and I think they've got three weeks of comments just penting up here.
731219	734920	Mike W. says, Rob was also the only OLR host without a 360 for a while.
734980	735481	That's true.
735901	736761	I didn't get a 360 until March.
736801	743583	To be honest, though... You eBayed it, or Craigslisted it or something and paid way too much for one, and she got the hookup because Dan was working it.
743783	745344	To be honest, I wouldn't have bought a PS3.
747305	750068	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
766102	768624	Rob says, Hey Rob, you're not missing anything with the Doorstop 3.
769305	771206	You know, there really isn't anything.
771326	776130	Actually, what I would want most out of it right now is the Blu-ray player and fucking Tekken Dark Resurrection.
776750	778372	Yeah, that looks pretty badass.
778392	784577	I haven't downloaded that because it's in another country and I don't like fighting games that much, so it's not a big deal for me.
784977	790161	But I tried Grip Shift and that blows ass and I would not recommend it at all.
791121	792541	MotorStorm is fucking awesome.
792601	793542	I love the demo from MotorStorm.
793562	794902	I did not like MotorStorm at all.
795082	796042	Oh, I love MotorStorm.
796802	797783	You didn't think it was slow?
797863	798663	I thought it was slow.
798703	799343	No, it's good.
799423	799763	It's good.
799783	800003	I like it.
800043	801223	Was it just maybe the target I was at?
801243	801943	I don't know.
802003	808185	Jaded says, next week, Loki takes back everything he said about Macs because he received a Mac and gloats about it.
808465	810265	Could this be the year of change for Loki?
810285	813466	No, listen, if I got a free Mac, I'd be selling that shit back.
814066	815606	I'd actually probably smash it with a hammer.
815866	816546	Or give it to Nelly.
816566	817207	She'd probably want it.
817487	818247	But, um, no.
818767	818907	Um...
819562	822883	Other than... Mac fans, don't turn us off, because I heart Macs, and so does Jamie.
822923	823764	He's just crazy.
823924	824764	I just don't like them.
825164	826245	And, you know... We're building a PC.
826605	832907	And I don't know if anyone's seen the new pictures of the new VAIO, but... My God, Sony's copying Apple now.
833287	833827	That's pretty bad.
834388	836729	Anyways, so, back in the games, real quick.
837789	840290	So, yeah, I played that Gran Turismo HD.
840810	844131	It actually looks better than the one at E3, but not by much.
844452	848113	So, thank God it's free, because I sure as hell wouldn't buy that piece of shit.
849188	850869	I don't like Gran Turismo, so that's just me.
851590	855012	It looks pretty, I guess, but I don't know.
855072	870821	It seems to me, and this is what I've noticed with a lot of the games on there, it seems to me a lot of these racing games, because that's mainly what I've been playing, have the kind of okay foreground stuff, and they have this really high-res background image that's kind of plastered on there.
871121	875024	I don't know if you've noticed that in some of the pictures of Gran Turismo HD and Motorstorm and stuff.
875084	875304	It's just
875791	878272	I'm looking forward to doing that, but I've been too busy playing the story mode in it, and I love...
906441	908983	Even with no achievements to unlock, this is amazing to me.
910344	914707	See, the thing that's kind of cool about those, they sort of have an achievement system for that one game.
914747	920092	You unlock these skill points, they call them, and it actually unlocks different things like costumes and stuff.
920332	923154	So like in Excite Truck and Burnout, you get trophies.
923314	924155	Yeah, something like that.
924608	936113	But what's kind of neat, though, is when you play through the whole game, it unlocks more weapons, and you can go back and play through again, and then you can unlock harder difficulties and stuff, and you get more skins for multiplayer.
936833	940555	But I do want to try out 40-player multiplayer online with that.
940915	941716	I think that'd be crazy.
943756	944797	All right, is that it for Gaming Week?
945997	946498	That is it.
946918	953341	Oh, and by the way, just real quick, real quick, PlayStation 3, their download thing, okay, fucking sucks.
953481	954141	Balls, okay?
954721	960447	The fact that it takes like an hour to download something and you can't do anything while it's downloading.
960767	962549	That fucking sucks and they need to fix that.
962689	964150	Okay, now I'm done.
964190	967193	Quick comment on the PlayStation 3 from Jared Joe in chat.
967674	969836	I love the potential of my PS3 so far.
970176	971738	I can't wait for it to unleash itself.
971818	975441	I have Resistance and Marvel Ultimate Alliance and both of those games are fantastic.
975621	976402	I had Genji.
976742	978704	Notice I said I had Genji.
980652	983275	I have a demo, but I haven't played it yet.
1002575	1007336	I haven't sold mine back yet, but that's because I like going in every now and then punching animals.
1030483	1030943	That's just me.
1045709	1046850	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1068623	1070604	Every week, once a week, we play Quake.
1070824	1076005	And we decided to try and bring that back a little bit and be in touch, because now we live all over.
1076065	1081107	My buddy Garrett is in town, but Bill's off in New York City, and Matt's all traveling around the world.
1081147	1083187	So we kind of tried to connect through Xbox Live.
1083207	1084328	So we played Halo this week.
1084828	1086108	But what's really funny, well, Halo 2.
1086288	1087849	We were playing Halo 2 online.
1087889	1089009	We all suck at it, right?
1089269	1093290	But that's the fun part of it, is that when you're playing against other people who suck at Halo, it's pretty fun.
1093630	1095651	But what's really funny about what happened during it is that
1096546	1097249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1100879	1105641	and somebody that joined the game was GamerAndy over, you know, because he has a site, GamerAndy.com, right?
1105901	1112443	And he was signing on to kind of say, I'm sorry, we weren't able to, because he was, he got an invite to the New Year's show, but just scheduling conflicts, he wasn't able to make it on.
1112723	1115664	So he was coming on to say, you know, oh, sorry, I couldn't make it, we'll have to make up.
1115704	1118505	And we'll definitely have him on the show at some other time, because he's a really cool guy.
1118865	1122727	But, oh my God, he kicked all our asses so horribly at Halo.
1123487	1126288	He's like, oh, I'm not any good, I haven't played, you know, he's very humble.
1126308	1128489	He's like, I haven't played in a year and a half, I suck at Halo.
1128849	1130289	And he just wiped all of us.
1130309	1133110	My friend Matt's pretty good, so he was giving him some competition.
1133230	1144272	I really need to buy Halo 2 because, you know, I have... I think it was fun when I played, you know, briefly a long time ago, but I really... I'm not that great at first-person shooters sometimes.
1144332	1152274	I mean, when we're playing Call of Duty 3, all I'm basically... All we play now is rocket launchers, sniper rifles... Yeah, that's actually what we were playing was the rockets.
1152394	1155395	And that game was kind of fun because that's easy to kill someone in rockets, so...
1156485	1158907	Yeah, but, yeah, just rockets and just sniper rifles.
1158927	1161508	Can we form a clan for, like, I suck at Halo?
1161548	1166211	I mean, I realize we have the OL Army, but there's actually good players in the OL Army.
1166231	1167652	We have some people that are, like, level 21.
1168272	1170634	Can we get, like, level 1 for life, Joe?
1170674	1172435	Dude, I... Level 1 for life.
1172495	1177618	I suck completely... I suck ass at Halo, so... When Halo 3 comes out, I'm scared.
1177658	1178499	I'm seriously scared.
1178939	1180380	We'll just play, because I'll buy Halo 3.
1180420	1181021	Okay, there you go.
1181321	1184683	I'm getting a Legendary Edition, so I have a helmet at my desk, but that's about it.
1185505	1210636	and then otherwise I haven't been playing a lot I mean the arcade of course DDR and stuff but otherwise I got 200 of 200 achievement points in New Rally X thank you very much which is sadly the first arcade game I've gotten all the achievement points on and I'm the only one on my friends list that has played the damn game and I know that because I'm the only one with a high score on the list and I have like 70 something friends on Xbox Live and not a damn other person has played the game except me
1214685	1215406	But you know what?
1215446	1217388	The only reason I bought it, I remember from my childhood, okay?
1217428	1217929	So don't hate.
1218489	1219811	I remember Rally X and the good old days.
1219831	1220732	Now that you're an old man.
1221013	1221253	I know.
1222094	1222434	All right.
1223965	1224105	D.M.N.
1224145	1224425	from STFU
1253908	1280500	and don't forget all our other live programming on Orange Lounge Radio again and of course we wanted to say take a moment to thank again all of our New Year's Eve people we had on this week we hope to incorporate guests not just from like the gaming industry but like other gaming podcasts and people you see out there in the gaming media we're trying to think of ways to incorporate that on into 2007 because the New Year's episode seemed to be really well received and you guys seemed to dig that so definitely we'll do stuff more like that in the future it was cool good times
1281218	1282159	Alright, how about some gaming news?
1282379	1283940	Let's talk some smack about some gaming news.
1284040	1285402	Loki, start us off.
1285762	1294649	Well, apparently there's a small little convention going on called CES, Consumer Electronics Show, that I completely forgot about.
1294669	1297152	And I was like, oh yeah, CES is going on.
1297592	1301796	Anyways, so I'm kind of starting that all off.
1302476	1307861	There's been some rumors coming out about a brand new version of the Xbox 360, now with HDMI.
1310364	1311805	Code name the Zephyr.
1312725	1316386	And apparently there's been shots floating around from Engadget.
1317067	1320648	I know there was some video on there from Xbox Scene.
1321808	1326090	So definitely something that's probably going to be out there at some point.
1326590	1330111	Although a lot of people are bitching saying, oh, what about the early adopters?
1330171	1331172	You screwed all of them.
1331292	1334353	But, you know, I'm just like, I don't need HDMI.
1335236	1335576	Whatever.
1335696	1336877	My TV doesn't have HDMI.
1336917	1339398	Well, Nintendo does this shit all the time, no one seems to mind.
1339578	1340419	Yeah, exactly.
1340539	1354006	I mean, you know, the DS Lite, I mean, sure, my panties were ruffled a little bit at the fact that, you know, the DS Lite comes out not even like a year after the DS is already on shelves, and I bought the first printing of the DS, but what can you do?
1354086	1355767	I mean, this thing is inevitable.
1355947	1358968	Yeah, really, I mean, for me, it's not a big deal.
1359249	1363931	I mean, I guess later on down the line, if I really had an issue with this, I can just
1364406	1365707	I guess buy another one or something.
1366087	1370970	But, I don't know, my TV doesn't have HDMI, so it's no good for me.
1371050	1377675	I think my TV does, but, you know, I go back and I think about how long I was like, I have to get a component cable for the Wii.
1377975	1379256	I have to get a component cable.
1379476	1380837	I have to have like the best video ever.
1380877	1382418	And then it really wasn't that big a difference.
1382938	1388502	So I think like, is it really going to be a deal breaker that I can't, I don't get HDMI right away?
1388962	1393285	I mean, chances are my 360 will break eventually anyway and I have to get a new one because
1394039	1397461	So, I'll just wait for that inevitability.
1397721	1398141	Exactly.
1398521	1403804	And a lot of people are saying also that the new 360 is going to... And I don't even know where they're pulling this info from.
1403924	1407705	I mean, because I believe the HDMI part because, you know, we've seen pictures of it.
1407725	1410647	But they're saying, oh, it's going to have a 120 gig hard drive and all this stuff.
1411227	1418450	And, you know, it's going to have the 65 nanometer chipsets in there and stuff.
1420351	1421652	You know, really...
1423014	1425175	The 120GB hard drive will be something that they add on later.
1425575	1428816	I mean, that's something that they'll have the offer that you can buy.
1429816	1431697	It's not going to be probably included with this.
1432557	1434478	I mean, I don't know.
1435038	1438039	To be honest, all I think they're going to do is add this HDMI port.
1438139	1440019	It's not going to be a brand new model of the 360.
1440220	1443941	It's just going to be, now the 360s are coming out with HDMI ports on them.
1444901	1445401	That is it.
1446181	1451223	And they'll have the cooler processor in there, so lower the cost of the system, but
1451658	1454620	I don't think they're going to do anything above and beyond this.
1476530	1477571	DDR Dollar Bill says, HDMI don't care
1504541	1509144	Uh, let's see, we have, um, I believe it was Paradox Vincent said, uh, DS Fat sucks!
1510625	1516028	And, uh, NM64 says, uh, DS Lite is only worth it if you need a new DS or never had one.
1516348	1517789	So some conflicting opinions there.
1518069	1518890	I think the Fat is fine.
1518910	1521731	Did you know the DS Fat is actually louder than the DS Lite?
1521971	1525373	Which is good for games like Elite Beat Agents and stuff when you need to, you know, drown other people out.
1525914	1526014	Um...
1526894	1528095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1554252	1557154	They did the top-loading one that looked like a Famicom later on.
1557275	1565561	And then, you know, with, well, I guess not really the Nintendo 64, the Super Nintendo, but the 64, they added Rumble later on.
1565661	1567923	Then you could add the RAM pack later on.
1567983	1568904	Oh, and they had the Pokemon 64.
1569184	1571566	Yeah, exactly, the Pokemon 64.
1571626	1574028	They always tried to pull this shit.
1574088	1581014	And don't think that they don't know that later on, you know, people are going to buy an extra DS because it's in a specific color.
1581034	1582215	I mean, come on, it doesn't,
1582990	1585971	It's not that hard to manufacture the DS in a different color.
1586011	1588231	Ooh, ooh, I just thought though, Microsoft does that too.
1588511	1589251	They've done it before.
1589431	1590831	You know what kind of Xbox I have?
1591532	1593272	I don't have the same Xbox most people have.
1593312	1595452	I have a Halo Xbox that's the see-through green.
1595472	1597213	I have a Halo Xbox that's the see-through green.
1597293	1598973	Yeah, but most people don't have that.
1599133	1600953	Most people have the big black brick, right?
1601653	1602854	My big black brick died.
1602914	1605154	Microsoft is not beyond redesigning their consoles.
1605394	1605894	Exactly.
1606994	1609575	Don't you think there will be a Halo 3 limited edition console?
1610362	1611422	Or do you think it'll just be a faceplate?
1611442	1613683	Sega did it too, back with the Sega Support Streamcast.
1615124	1616864	I think the faceplates are what they're doing now.
1616924	1617685	That's a big thing.
1617825	1620726	But I wouldn't be surprised if we see a black console later.
1622066	1623567	I think that's something that's very possible.
1624367	1625808	I don't know.
1625828	1627368	We all know the Wii colors are coming.
1627428	1628489	It's just a matter of time.
1628509	1628989	Oh, yeah.
1629029	1629809	Those are coming.
1629929	1631350	Same with the PlayStation 3 colors.
1631370	1632530	You're going to see those as well.
1632570	1633190	I mean, come on.
1633210	1636912	This is not... I mean, look at the PlayStation 2.
1637172	1638652	They have silver, pink.
1638752	1639473	I mean, come on.
1639693	1640033	It's just...
1640623	1641083	Everybody does it.
1641104	1643846	Because I need something to match my cabinet that I got at Ikea.
1644086	1648390	It's like, oh my god, I gotta totally get a pink one for my girlfriend because she's going to totally appreciate it.
1648610	1650571	And when you give it to her, she's like, wow, this is so pretty.
1651192	1652773	What the fuck am I going to play on it?
1654615	1659559	So, you know, people, you know why they keep doing this, you guys?
1659899	1663622	It's because people are retarded and they will buy this shit.
1663943	1666565	They will buy a blue DS when it comes out because it's blue.
1666605	1668987	They'll buy a pink DS when it comes out because it's pink.
1669892	1682520	because people are retarded and they don't understand there's websites out there that make custom color DSs that you can order brand new in any fucking color of the rainbow that you want instead of having to wait for Nintendo to put it out.
1684241	1687904	You know, there's a conversation going on in chat right now that has me thinking a little bit.
1687944	1692286	Do you think the black Wii will be a little bit bigger than the white Wii?
1693807	1695689	Yeah, and the yellow Wii is going to be super tiny.
1697250	1697830	Yeah, okay.
1699138	1703020	You can address those cards and letters to Loki at OrangeLawnsRadio.com Hey, you started it, okay?
1704621	1707202	Let's just move right along to talking about Halo 3.
1707242	1709643	Of course, we were talking about that a little bit.
1710084	1711584	And the beta testing, right?
1711604	1714666	You had everybody slam that site trying to get into the beta test.
1714706	1716987	And you'll find out this month if you got into the beta test.
1717307	1721730	But if you didn't get in that way, there is the Rule of Three.
1722708	1733311	and I don't know why else you would call it that unless you want people to say the rule of three, the mysterious rule of three to get into the Halo 3 beta test.
1734191	1752057	What's going to happen is that if you play three hours worth of Halo 2 multiplayer between Thursday the 1st of February and February 3rd, 2007, if you're among one of the first 13,333 to register at Halo3.com right after that, then you will be part of the Halo 3 beta.
1752827	1754628	The other way to get into it, buy Crackdown.
1776238	1783660	It was cool when it was like a beta thing and you didn't know how many people were going to get into it and you thought, oh, hey, this is going to be only a couple thousand.
1784320	1785100	That's kind of cool.
1785120	1786501	You're in the cool club now.
1786781	1790442	Now we're, oh, anyone that buys this game will get into the beta.
1790562	1792302	Oh, and this is another way to get into the beta.
1793202	1799364	Why the fuck is a beta test like fucking incentive to buy something or do something?
1799424	1803705	I mean, you're beta testing something and you don't realize that's actually work.
1804448	1805468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1834560	1841882	People will be on their consoles one minute after, play the three hours back to back to back, and then be on Halo 3 immediately.
1841942	1844122	There will be 13,333 people to do that.
1844582	1846903	So I don't know why Microsoft bothered to make such a big window.
1847123	1847503	Seriously.
1848483	1851524	I'm just going to buy Crackdown and play Crackdown.
1851564	1857806	I'm telling you right now, if you want to get in that way, if you're not on there at midnight ready to play until 3 a.m., forget it.
1857886	1858286	Write it off.
1858306	1858886	You're not getting in.
1859866	1860326	I'm sorry.
1860866	1862047	You know that's how it's going to work.
1863007	1863347	You know it.
1864275	1865676	There's some people who got to play it anyway.
1867457	1868157	Oh, oh really?
1868417	1868678	Yeah.
1868778	1869198	Oh really?
1869718	1869938	Yep.
1870078	1870459	Ooh.
1871019	1871699	Let's beat them up.
1871739	1872800	Take their lunch money.
1872820	1875402	I think that they could actually beat any one of us.
1875522	1876042	Oh really?
1877423	1882806	Bungie actually flew over copies of the beta to the troops overseas.
1883026	1884447	Oh yeah, they probably could get my SCM.
1884727	1885127	Probably could.
1885247	1886928	Never mind.
1887108	1887369	Hearts.
1887829	1890370	And basically let them have the free demo for Christmas.
1890691	1891231	Give it a try.
1892325	1893546	and I think that's pretty cool.
1893706	1894467	That's kind of neat.
1894687	1896569	That's something kind of different.
1897289	1898991	I think a very interesting way.
1899031	1904656	And I bet you a lot of our troops are kind of into Halo 2 and 3 and all that stuff.
1904696	1905957	So I think that's kind of cool.
1906397	1910941	And it's a good way, I think, to relieve some of the stress of having to be there.
1910961	1911942	I think it was a really good thing.
1913223	1913584	That's neat.
1914324	1914905	Good job, Bungie.
1916546	1919088	Anyways, so more stuff for the 360.
1920230	1928193	You know how they always have themes and stuff on Xbox Live and they're so wonderful how they don't show you what they look like before you buy them.
1928613	1942739	Well, thankfully there is a website now that will show you what they look like called DashboardThemes.com and you can go there before you buy a theme and check out what it looks like and possibly save your Xbox Live points.
1943019	1949542	Personally, I would just save your Xbox Live points or the other thing you can do if you have a memory unit
1949923	1950304	DarkSakura.com
1961588	1966491	Although, from what I remember reading on this site, the people were putting it together with their own money.
1967131	1978597	So, you know, they do deserve some type of, you know, medallion or recognition from the community for putting together that public service because for whatever reason, Microsoft isn't on top of it with their previews.
1978617	1983100	I mean, you can preview some stuff on Xbox.com to be fair, but they're not very current.
1983200	1985621	And these guys, you know, they have it the day it comes out.
1986101	1989983	So, I think they deserve a round of applause from the gaming community.
1990444	1990804	Yay.
1992082	1992342	All right.
1993383	1995766	Well, other surprises that you might find.
1996947	2013724	What's interesting is that this 14-year-old boy who lives in Utah claims that he purchased a factory-sealed copy of Madden 07 for the Xbox 360, and he put the disc in his system, and up came, not John Madden, but hardcore pornography.
2013924	2015006	That's a roster update.
2015757	2022100	The boy immediately notified his parents and they're backing up the claim and said this is legit.
2022520	2031463	Now, Electronic Arts was contacted and they're working with the store that the game was bought from to see if maybe something funny went on here.
2031503	2034965	Like maybe a disgruntled employee put some porn in there.
2035005	2038626	You know, because how easy would it be to print out a Madden label like on your computer?
2039039	2040800	and then take a porn disc and put it on there?
2040840	2045602	It's a little harder because those are actually silk-screened onto the discs.
2046042	2054146	Yeah, but if you're 14 and you don't know to look for that kind of stuff, I mean, don't you think someone could get away with that?
2055206	2056447	You'd have to be pretty retarded.
2056687	2058007	Although he does look pretty retarded.
2058648	2059228	You're nice.
2060989	2066131	You would have to be pretty retarded if you're a 14-year-old boy and you get porn and go tell your parents.
2067977	2068877	I'm playing Madden.
2068917	2069337	Go away!
2069397	2070698	Keep the door shut.
2071038	2071938	I'm playing Madden.
2072018	2074518	Inviting all your friends over to play Madden.
2074558	2076899	Building a shrine to the Madden disc in your bedroom.
2077219	2077899	That's beautiful.
2077919	2083180	You're going to see the coolest copy of Madden you've ever seen.
2098368	2102631	EA would, quote, regrets any embarrassment the matter has caused the family.
2105092	2107034	That's a way to learn a lesson early.
2107414	2109295	By the way, one other quote that's great here.
2109615	2118781	According to a paper in Utah, the Standard Examiner, when Mahoney looked at the pornographic images, his first thought was, quote, this is definitely not Madden.
2120662	2122723	No, it's NHL 2000.
2126283	2126864	on Dreamcast.
2145946	2153256	JeremyTodd1 says, Loki, wouldn't you rather sue the game company and get millions rather than keep some porn you can find for free?
2153416	2156200	RavensDolphin1 said, I found porn on my PSP memory card from EB, I told nobody
2166266	2167547	Was it a used game or a new one?
2167927	2170069	That's a used... Oh, that game?
2170189	2171850	That was a new factory-sealed game.
2172090	2172851	That's fun.
2173271	2178634	Fireboma says he notified his parents, quote, under long review, this is porn.
2178814	2182477	Quote, hold on, we have to go review... Gotta go to the bathroom.
2184998	2188161	Well, speaking of something that has nothing to do with porn... Okay.
2188181	2190302	I don't know, it might have been, but that's not official.
2191563	2193524	Guess who's leaving Rare for more porn?
2193564	2195065	I mean, for not porn.
2196331	2197012	The pinatas?
2198094	2201319	The Stamper Brothers are leaving Rare.
2201459	2202982	Wait, didn't they like found it or something?
2203363	2203563	Yep.
2204605	2209352	They were one of the, well, I guess two of the main folks behind Rare and now they're gone.
2209372	2209633	Bye-bye.
2210424	2214788	They've gone to, uh, quote, uh, pursue other opportunities.
2214808	2216449	They're like, they're all, fuck this shit!
2216549	2218891	We ain't making no more fucking pinata games!
2219231	2220793	Fuck this, we want Killer Instinct!
2220813	2222214	Well, wait, wait a damn minute, though.
2222234	2225457	Viva Pinata was the best thing Rare's put out in a while, sadly.
2225597	2226718	They did put out, didn't they?
2228980	2229300	Porn.
2231071	2234332	We promise, just make the pinata game and we'll let you make Killer Instinct.
2234352	2238032	What I want to know is, Viva Pinata was not that bad.
2238092	2239632	I mean, it's actually quite good.
2239933	2242933	It's a pleasant surprise of a game, so don't knock it until you've tried it.
2243093	2243973	It's a pretty fun game.
2244393	2248434	I had way more fun with Viva Pinata than Cameo and Perfect Dark Zero combined.
2248614	2249114	End of story.
2249354	2249814	End of story.
2249834	2251875	Okay, well, Perfect Dark Zero is like balls.
2251895	2258396	So if that's why, yeah, I know, and I'm like, if that's why they left was over Viva Pinata, then bye, don't let the door hit your ass on the way out.
2258856	2259796	But, you know, I...
2261048	2270694	What I want to know was, did they leave this voluntarily, or is this one of those nice ways of saying they were asked to leave because the community was not too receptive to some of the recent games?
2270934	2273335	And I don't believe Viva Pinata is performing very well.
2273475	2275056	I don't think it's reaching the target audience.
2275316	2277898	I mean, critically, it's doing well, but that doesn't always translate to money.
2278378	2278838	You know what I mean?
2280359	2285722	There's actually an interview, but I have to look a little bit more further into that, but I think it's willing.
2287363	2287704	Interesting.
2287764	2288944	Do you think they'll start a rival company?
2289485	2290045	I hope so.
2292122	2294425	They should make one called Uncommon.
2296307	2298210	WonderDogHerald says... Oh, I get it.
2298650	2300853	WonderDogHerald says they're just taking the money and running.
2303977	2306580	DJ Morpheus says thanks to Viva I can't play my 360 right now.
2309111	2313734	and I think that's because I've seen his woman on there playing Viva Pinata non-stop because she's on my friends list.
2314275	2318578	I could be looking at my Xbox friends list at 1 in the afternoon and look who's online playing Viva Pinata.
2318598	2324942	You know what would be hilarious is if you smack that woman enough times that she like locked up your system for like an hour or something like that.
2325203	2325463	What?
2326003	2329165	No, I said that'd be funny if that happened, you know, in the game where you smack her.
2329406	2332568	Oh, I thought you meant Travis's woman.
2332648	2333889	I was like, that's not nice.
2335285	2335485	Catamari
2364850	2368473	Although what does suck ass is the fact that it's not coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2369193	2386847	Apparently that was a rumor that was going around, but of course diffused by the worldwide Xbox Live Arcade games portfolio manager, Ross Erickson, who basically said that the rumor is total crap and is not happening.
2387667	2389869	So, yeah.
2390777	2392118	No Katamari.
2392258	2395961	But I'm sure we'll see Katamari come to the 360 some point.
2396462	2396902	You think?
2397102	2397543	I think so.
2398063	2398383	Really?
2399084	2400605	Namco likes remaking stuff.
2401306	2402006	Look at Rage Racer.
2403287	2403708	I don't know.
2405669	2408892	I don't know yet about what the future has in store for Katamari.
2408912	2410493	There's going to be more Katamari games.
2410513	2412515	They registered trademarks already for them.
2412915	2416338	Unless they're going to do some fucking Katamari cartoon, which would be even more cool.
2416818	2418620	All right.
2420054	2420455	Let's see.
2420555	2424217	We also have some other interesting rumors going around.
2424237	2426399	Because the Katamari thing started as a rumor.
2426759	2435986	Well, now they're saying that Radiant Silvergun 3, there was a report earlier this week, that Radiant Silvergun 3 was going to be on the Xbox 360.
2437106	2439588	Also, Knights is going to be coming to the Wii.
2439988	2441069	That would be very interesting.
2441389	2443030	Knights on the Wii would be fun.
2443050	2447614	Of course, the Radiant Silvergun 3 did get basically...
2448871	2449671	We still have Ikaruga.
2475103	2477405	I'm still thinking about getting that Dreamcast one that's coming out.
2477425	2478445	Is it New Hope or something like that?
2503888	2505748	My Dreamcast is in a box, sadly.
2506889	2509529	We used to have ours in an Xbox kiosk.
2510510	2512090	One of those little demo stations, the old ones.
2512450	2513750	We used to have our Dreamcast sitting in one.
2513770	2515751	Whatever happened to your demo station you had?
2515791	2516391	I've never seen it.
2516431	2516631	Really?
2517871	2518952	How much do those things sell for?
2519332	2520592	I have no idea what we got for it.
2521452	2521672	Really?
2521752	2521932	What?
2521992	2522472	How much, Loki?
2523233	2524713	Like $500, if not more.
2524773	2526033	Were you looking at that on eBay or something?
2526914	2527914	Well, I was for a customer.
2527934	2528754	They wanted to bring it.
2529042	2557428	you know those things are so hard to get like for even like Microsoft for example in order to get a kiosk into your store you have to be buying lots of Microsoft product and then you get the privilege of buying one from them for like a couple grand it's like thank you for giving me the privilege to buy one from you you fucking douche but I'm trying to push your product you know and you don't want to give me a kiosk or sell me a kiosk I don't understand it but whatever well
2558084	2559045	So, I guess we don't know.
2587136	2590538	So it's kind of one of those things where it's like it's happening, but we're not going to tell you anything else.
2591418	2603944	Well, they're saying that they might do a... There's a rumor, at least, that there's going to be a smaller one, either for PC or something on Xbox Live Arcade, but... I mean, like, PC is MMO home, though.
2604364	2612128	It would be a little silly to not put it out on the PC, especially, you know, when the Xbox 360 is a PC, according to, you know, something I read just before we went live tonight.
2612548	2614249	You know, according to what Bill Gates, the Xbox 360 is a PC.
2614269	2614309	So...
2616340	2617060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2642681	2646904	Being that we put this show out on Sundays, some of the stuff has come out during the week.
2647405	2651048	Two of those were brand new Ubisoft games, whoop-de-doo.
2651068	2652449	Hold on, hold on.
2652529	2657312	I want to say before you start getting this stuff out, we have to get a little disclaimer about sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong.
2658193	2658433	Right?
2659174	2660695	Hey, listen.
2660755	2661516	New year, new show.
2661996	2664018	So sometimes these dates are right and sometimes they're wrong.
2664058	2664998	Why are they wrong sometimes?
2665138	2668901	They're wrong sometimes because they change dates daily.
2669161	2671123	So stuff changes all the time.
2671901	2675967	and a company to announce a date initially and have that date stick.
2676658	2677459	is like a rarity.
2677719	2678739	This stuff shuffles around.
2678980	2690087	And the only reason it shuffles around is development cycles, whether they're in behind or ahead in development or getting approval from like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.
2690427	2699132	For instance, just to kind of give an example, this week, or actually I should say a long time ago, I want to say it was in like episode 195 or something.
2699152	2701534	It was a while ago, a long time ago, about six months ago.
2701594	2705456	You said that Bioshock was coming out in April of 2007.
2705516	2705677	Yeah.
2706597	2712740	But then this week we heard that there was a 2K Games rep that was posting on some forum that said, it's coming out in June, you heard it here first.
2713080	2717382	So it's kind of like, you were in the right ballpark, but for whatever reason these developers... No, they changed it.
2718002	2725005	The same day... Well, actually, I think... Because I don't pay attention to some of these date changes or don't bother repeating them again.
2725426	2730428	But before the guy came out and said, oh yeah, by the way, this is... We had a date change to...
2731223	2732344	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2747879	2749580	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
2767592	2771713	You knew about Oblivion on the PlayStation 3 six months before anybody ever announced it officially.
2772073	2774294	Whenever these titles drop in, it's always right.
2774314	2775194	That's what I've noticed.
2775334	2776435	And Oblivion on PSP.
2776455	2776815	That's right.
2776855	2777795	I remember that from last year.
2777955	2779255	And Full Auto 2 on PSP.
2781296	2784097	So is there anything in this list that's new that we don't know about yet?
2784277	2784697	Well, yes.
2785117	2785757	I do have stuff.
2785997	2795920	Okay, first off, we mentioned it last week, Driver Parallel Lines for the PSP, which was actually March 14th was when that was coming out.
2796540	2798482	Now it's being changed to Driver 76.
2798682	2804707	Because if you remember, Driver Parallel Alliance started off in 1976 and then it comes in the modern time.
2805047	2808550	So I'm guessing this game is going to be Driver Parallel Alliance, but just set in 1976.
2808670	2811472	I didn't know that because the Driver series sucks.
2812313	2814034	Yeah, it does.
2814054	2815515	But that's just happening.
2815855	2817417	However, though, I do have a date for you.
2817437	2818277	This will make you happy.
2818357	2822240	Enchanted Arms for the PlayStation 3, March 14th as well.
2824502	2825523	We knew that was coming.
2826680	2831725	Definitely one that, you know, not a big surprise, but we don't have a date for that yet, so that's kind of cool.
2832525	2834147	New games, though, that haven't been announced.
2834247	2838490	Dream Pinball 3D for the Wii, coming out October 10th, so still ways off.
2839011	2845196	And not a huge surprise, but Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii.
2845276	2847397	Movie time, mandatory movie time.
2847437	2848678	PS2, not 3.
2849619	2850040	PS2.
2851181	2852882	Not a lot of stuff being developed for PlayStation 3.
2853082	2855364	PlayStation 2, though, lots of stuff.
2855959	2856399	Interesting.
2857140	2861183	And, uh, by the way, those two Ubisoft games, uh, Cosmic Family and Spelling Spree.
2862103	2864445	Cosmic Family, I hear, is meant for really little kids.
2865426	2867928	Because I guess it's based off a cartoon series or something like that.
2868228	2873952	And then Spelling Spree, um, I'm guessing some sort of, like, DS type of game.
2874172	2880416	It makes me think, like, imagine people driving by in their cars, rolling down the window, and, like, spelling at them to death.
2882978	2883799	Yeah, well...
2884850	2886091	P-R-I-Z-E, die!
2886791	2892114	But remember, we mentioned last week, and I haven't seen this anywhere yet, but Driver Parallel Alliance is on the Wii.
2892254	2894195	That was one of the ones that they didn't mention.
2894636	2897517	Not that I really care to play that on the Wii, but I'm just saying, you know.
2899018	2899818	Letting it be known.
2900139	2900519	Alright.
2900679	2902560	So you heard it here first.
2903440	2903781	Hopefully.
2905021	2905402	We think.
2906322	2909604	Hey, I can't check the whole internet, but as far as I'm aware, none of the
2910111	2910631	DarkSakura.com
2940070	2941491	PlayStation 2, Arthur, The Shield, New Yu-Gi-Oh!
2964992	2966593	Japanese release dates.
2966794	2968796	You have a couple big titles coming out.
2968956	2973061	Atsumare Pinata is coming out January 11, 2007 on 360.
2973121	2976364	That's the name of Viva Pinata, localized for Japan.
2976885	2980269	For the PlayStation 3, you get NBA 07 over there.
2980829	2980949	And...
2981837	2982317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3000347	3002889	GT Pro Series coming out for the Nintendo Wii.
3003690	3004851	I recommend you pass on that one.
3005612	3008854	Coming out on January 11th for the PlayStation 2.
3009735	3010856	Not a lot of new stuff.
3010876	3021444	You do get a couple things going into the best series from Koei, including Warship Gunner 2 and Shin Sangoku Musou 3 Empires and Mushoden.
3022105	3024727	I should note, though, that .hack//G.U.
3024787	3028310	Volume 3 is out next week, so I know a lot of folks are really into .hack//G.U.
3028910	3030171	That's on its way out pretty soon.
3031272	3046023	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Zetai Onkan Training DS and DS Dengeki Bunko, Ira no Sora, UFO no Natsu is coming out this week, January 11th.
3046443	3047744	And of course... That's funny.
3048125	3048345	What?
3049806	3052388	I guess UFO of Summer?
3052932	3059076	DS Dengeki Bunko Ira no Sora UFO no Natsu Huh That's what it's called Okay But probably most people holding out for Oh, never mind, it's a US release, never mind
3085516	3085937	Who cares?
3085997	3087219	Are any of you really going to import it?
3087279	3087860	I didn't think so.
3088200	3088921	I think I will.
3089622	3090584	Actually, I'm planning on getting it.
3090624	3092967	What was that other game that's not coming out?
3093268	3094730	That one that we played for DDR?
3095811	3096993	I'm going to import that.
3098095	3098555	Which one?
3098636	3098796	The
3099875	3100435	They had the intro.
3100615	3101895	Oh, oh, Oz.
3102116	3102376	Yeah.
3102496	3103176	That's an old game.
3103336	3104796	I know it's old, but I think I'm going to get it.
3104896	3109037	Yeah, we played the Oz song, the Plovastian dance and chorus.
3109437	3111418	We played that today, and Jamie was like, I want that game.
3112218	3118899	Reading from that title, I think it's Ida of Sky something, summer, whatever.
3119420	3124281	Anyway, we have our UK release dates, if anyone's interested, which I am.
3126278	3128380	On the 12th is pretty much what's coming out.
3128680	3143211	Bionicle Heroes, Children of Mana, both on DS, Lost Planet, Extreme Condition on Xbox 360, Tokobot Plus, Mysteries of the Karakuri on PS2, and WarioWare Smooth Moves on Wii.
3145853	3147675	Yeah, I can't wait for WarioWare to come out next.
3147955	3150697	I think it's next week.
3151157	3151518	Yay!
3151838	3152559	New game!
3153539	3154000	Finally.
3154200	3154440	Anyways.
3155430	3166395	One new game, though, that we're probably not going to see, at least I hope to God we're not going to see this, is a new RPG based on Tingle, that really annoying gay fairy from Wind Waker.
3166435	3167836	Now, he hasn't come out yet.
3167896	3169116	It's just people assuming.
3169377	3175039	Okay, flaming gay fairy from Legend of Zelda Wind Waker.
3175079	3176900	Not that there's anything wrong with that, Loki.
3177040	3178281	Nothing wrong with that.
3178361	3180542	He's just super homo flaming gay.
3180842	3183483	Anyways, so apparently it's...
3184153	3187875	Oh god, it's possibly going to head to the US in 2017.
3188295	3192757	I was going to say, there is no freaking way this game is not coming to the US at this point.
3192978	3196339	If they're going out of their way to put it out in Europe, you know it's coming here.
3196800	3199261	You know it's coming, because the English version will already exist.
3199501	3200261	It's got to come here.
3200301	3200842	What about Mother 3?
3200882	3204023	Didn't that come out in the... I don't think it did come out over there.
3204083	3210327	It came out in Japan, of course, but... I thought there was one game that got translated for the UK, but never came out over here.
3210347	3212248	Well, I'm telling you, it's not going to be Tingle RPG.
3212288	3212568	It can't.
3213720	3214901	That was Mother 3.
3215281	3218222	Not with the freaking petition going on and everything.
3219082	3220562	There's people out there that want their Tingle.
3221703	3222103	Tingle.
3224064	3225324	You know you're going to want this game, Loki.
3225344	3227425	You're going to buy it.
3227465	3228465	Nellie's going to make you buy it.
3228485	3230066	She will not make me buy this stuff.
3230106	3231926	I will show it to her and then she'll make you buy it.
3233927	3235107	I want to play the Tingle RPG.
3235127	3235547	It'll be fun.
3235587	3237148	Jamie, will you play the Tingle RPG?
3238348	3238748	Maybe.
3239669	3240349	When I'm out of school.
3241623	3244724	NM64 would like to point out, Loki, Tingle was in Majora's Mask.
3246784	3251345	JeremyTodd1 says, fact, Rob tried to try out for the role of Tingle, but Nintendo rejected him.
3251906	3252606	Aw, sad.
3254186	3256907	That is, you know, it's true, though, that I do have this secret desire.
3256927	3258467	I've always wanted to be a voice actor in a game.
3258487	3259227	I think that would be fun.
3259587	3260688	That would be a lot of fun, don't you?
3261008	3262148	A voice actor in a game?
3262308	3263048	Yeah, wouldn't that be fun?
3263668	3265769	Well, not Tingle, God no, but, you know, something.
3266569	3269610	Maybe we could be a soldier that gets shot in Halo 3 or something.
3269750	3269990	I mean...
3270652	3272293	I don't even know what the hell you're doing there.
3272533	3273573	Oh, Tingle!
3275133	3277554	Oh my god, Loki!
3278194	3278835	You should do it!
3280955	3281816	I'm not gonna be Tingle.
3284236	3288798	I want someone to create a petition right now on that site, whatever that petition site is.
3289218	3290378	Loki for Tingle!
3290778	3292219	Does Tingle have a hag in that game?
3292899	3293399	I don't know.
3293639	3294820	I don't remember.
3296580	3297420	Holy god!
3298121	3298681	Thank you!
3299617	3302958	Insider Information says, Thank God it's not coming.
3303359	3306280	Holy Shonen says, Tingle funny, but I want him dead.
3308121	3309581	I don't think he'd sell well over here.
3310482	3310962	Too annoying.
3311772	3314395	People will say, fuck this Tingle shit, we want more Zelda.
3314796	3318801	Well, something else that won't come out over here is new music games for the PSP.
3319201	3319962	Interesting, huh?
3320323	3329054	Now, Sony is denying that a frequency sequel and a new music game called Traxian for the PSP were not...
3330035	3337918	Denied by them, but apparently Harmonix spoke to IGN recently, and the team behind Frequency said, this is what Sony did.
3338218	3342760	Sony denied Traxian and the Frequency sequel for the PSP.
3342800	3345081	Traxian was killed months ago.
3345721	3347022	Months ago that thing was gone.
3347382	3350243	Harmonix proposed the sequel on the handheld, but Sony said no.
3351123	3353984	On top of that, LucasArts was going to bring that game Traxian.
3354004	3356565	I'm sorry, it was LucasArts, not Harmonix, bringing Traxian.
3357005	3358566	And that was also axed.
3359585	3365172	I know for a fact Sony likes to pass on games they should not be passing on.
3366294	3376128	I'm shocked that they would... With all the furor that Red Octane is causing right now with Guitar Hero and everything, I...
3377798	3381200	I'm shocked that they would deny them to make a music game on the PSP.
3381220	3385723	Especially when you have freaking Taiko no Tatsujin, which is a stupid game.
3386103	3389605	I don't understand Sony's logic with the games they're not allowing through.
3390205	3391566	It doesn't make sense to me at all.
3393087	3393947	Bad move, Sony.
3394187	3401291	Because, you know, do this enough times to Harmonix, and Microsoft, who's going to probably be a little more welcoming, hey, you want to develop for us?
3401331	3402852	Yeah, great, we want games on the console.
3403153	3404533	You know what, that's where that game's going to end up.
3404553	3405034	What about...
3406369	3407129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3427646	3430248	The rumor now is for Tekken 6 on Xbox 360.
3431349	3442178	It was the same person, quote, IGN Insider, who was also credited for letting the news out for Virtua Fighter 5.
3444500	3448824	So if it's out, it's not like it hasn't been done before that's come out on a non-Sony system.
3449284	3453007	We've had the Game Boy Advance one.
3453427	3454388	Remember Tekken Advance?
3456050	3456550	I try not to.
3457293	3460015	I actually own that game, and I thought it was okay.
3461476	3463357	And then I've got the Bleemcast Tekken 3.
3465498	3465738	So.
3466979	3468240	Alright.
3468480	3472483	What would you think, being a Tekken fangirl that you are, what would you think about this coming to the 360?
3474440	3476041	is that good news, bad news?
3476302	3480145	I do always kind of put Tekken with Sony.
3480705	3485269	Think about Sony's version of Soul Calibur 2 had Heihachi as the bonus character.
3485589	3486991	Tekken's always been a very Sony thing.
3487411	3490814	The timing and everything of this seems a little fanboy to me.
3491034	3496058	I think this is just the negative Sony ball keeps on rolling and people are saying this.
3496098	3496979	I don't think this is legit.
3496999	3501763	There was also them saying, you remember Soul Calibur for the longest time was a Sony exclusive.
3502944	3511452	Yet we had three releases of Soul Calibur 2 on various systems, each with their own bonus character.
3512273	3515916	I'm not going to say yay or nay, but I don't think it's far-fetched.
3518078	3522482	Well, it's just there's not a lot, even though despite what Sony says, oh, we're meeting our numbers.
3522942	3525805	Yeah, they're lower numbers that they keep saying.
3526075	3526655	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3556215	3565718	So if you want to get your Tekken fix on the PlayStation 3 right now, you can definitely if you're in Japan because Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection is out there.
3566098	3568359	But if you're in another region, fear not.
3568479	3573861	There is a workaround just like they have for the Xbox 360 for their demos.
3574341	3575361	You can actually do this.
3575802	3580223	First, what you need to do on your PlayStation 3 is create a new user account for your PlayStation 3.
3580443	3584144	It cannot be an existing user or a sub-user.
3584385	3585745	It has to be completely from scratch.
3586206	3586546	www.DarkSakura.com
3612398	3617181	roughly at, I believe, $40 in Hong Kong twice.
3617642	3624626	And once you've done that, I guess that it's just under the radar for confirming your address or something like that.
3624686	3631049	Once you've done that, you're able to purchase the Tekken Dark Resurrection game from Japan.
3631089	3634911	You better hurry up and do it now because you know Sony's going to close the loophole on that within days.
3635292	3635452	Yeah.
3636432	3640995	So if you really want it... So do that now or just wait for it to come out.
3641638	3642419	Thanks for watching!
3659654	3664916	So let's talk about the top purchased arcade titles according to Major Nelson's list.
3665477	3669038	Starting off with the number 20 was Luminous Live, which I thought was kind of low on the list.
3669839	3685626	19, Cloning Clyde, 18, Small Arms, 17, Feeding Frenzy, 16, Bejeweled 2, 15, Texas Hold'em, 14, Zuma, 13, Contra, 12, Smash TV, 11, Bankshot Billiards 2, 10, Frogger, 9, Gauntlet, 8, Galaga, 7, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, 6, Doom,
3687246	3690848	5, Pac-Man, 4, Marble Blast Ultra, which seems a little high.
3691148	3693629	Although it's a good game, don't get me wrong, just I didn't think it would be that popular.
3694530	3701654	3, Geometry Wars Evolved, 2, Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting, and 1 was Uno, which isn't very surprising.
3701674	3702014	That's a big duh.
3703374	3704555	Well, they gave it out for free.
3705756	3709858	Plus, it was one of those ones that had porn and stuff, so not a huge surprise.
3710038	3710318	Gotcha.
3710894	3727281	As far as the top Xbox 360 titles, 20, Splinter Cell Double Agent, 19, Battlefield 18, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, 17, Need for Speed Most Wanted, 16, Dead Rising, 15, Madden NFL 07, 14, Texas Hold'em, 13, Dead or Alive 4, 12, Geometry Wars Evolved, 11, Saints Row,
3734165	3753913	10, EA Sports, Fight Night Round 3, 9, Uno, 8, Call of Duty 3, 7, Perfect Dark Zero, 6, Project Gotham Racing 3, 5, Oblivion, 4, Ghost Recon 3, 3, Call of Duty 2, 2, Hexic HD, because, you know, it was on all the hard drives, which is surprising because they left that off the arcade titles list.
3753933	3756154	I thought that was an arcade title, but never mind.
3756594	3759155	And number one, Gears of War, of course.
3760196	3760976	No big surprise there.
3763317	3763657	All right.
3764025	3765426	PhotoshopSupport.com
3792004	3795787	Um, tutorials, tools, resources, there's a good link with lots of brushes.
3796788	3798729	Um, lots of just good stuff on it.
3798769	3801231	There's even, uh, free, uh, stock photos.
3802132	3807936	Um, there's, uh, flash resources, Dreamweaver resources, fonts, textures, you name it.
3807976	3810337	This site is really, really freaking cool.
3810998	3817983	So, um, I, I'm going to, to vote, uh, PhotoshopSupport.com as my, uh, website of the week.
3820731	3822112	So surf there right now.
3822392	3823592	One more time, DarkSakura.
3823833	3827915	PhotoshopSupport.com If you can't spell it, I ain't spelling it out for you.
3828075	3828535	There you go.
3829796	3836899	Well, one thing that we're not spelling is lawsuit for L-A-W-S-U-I-T lawsuit.
3837039	3837439	I'm dead!
3839140	3839780	Is it spelled by?
3840541	3840861	Anyways.
3842362	3842742	So anyways.
3843102	3848905	So yeah, lawsuit between OverGuitarHero with, of course, guitars and
3849723	3851986	RedOctane, Activision, and the Ant Commandos
3871584	3872664	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
3872985	3874165	Everyone's kind of going their own way.
3874505	3880808	Which makes sense since, well, you know, Red Octane, they've fucking made third-party guitars for a long time now.
3880828	3887891	I mean, come on, this is like, I don't know, what's... It sounds to me like they kissed a mate up somehow, one way or another.
3888531	3890132	Someone blew somebody, I think.
3891653	3892233	But anyways...
3894690	3897232	Yeah, so all that's better now.
3897392	3900994	It doesn't really matter anyways, because if you wanted a wireless guitar, you can always buy the official one, I guess.
3901014	3904116	Did you see the Guitar Hero 2 360 box art?
3906217	3907738	No, I didn't get to pull that up at work.
3907978	3908378	I saw that.
3908438	3912941	I think there's a story coming up on it later in Part B, at least specifically what's in the game, so I won't spoil that.
3912961	3915102	But the box art's very interesting because it's all white.
3916181	3922806	And it's so weird because you're used to thinking, you know, you see the Guitar Hero boxes, they're black, but of course, this is more the Xbox 360's color scheme, so it's kind of interesting.
3923146	3924607	They just look different to me.
3925506	3926607	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3951357	3953178	Will Wright is kind of performing that role.
3953498	3960461	Now, SimCity DS is not based on the old SimCity, but it looks like it runs on, I think it's either the 2000 or the 3000 engine.
3960501	3964062	I think it's SimCity 3, not 2000.
3964763	3968844	It looks a little too in-depth, or they might have enhanced it a little bit.
3969124	3974387	But either way, it's that more 3D ISO type of view than the old school SimCity was.
3975891	3977712	I don't know how much we're going to agree with this.
4003903	4010988	But Eurogamer posted their top 50 games of 2006, and I've got the top 10.
4011949	4014491	So if anyone would like to know, I'll read them off.
4015372	4016252	Sure, why not?
4016613	4019795	I guess one more best of 06 list to close us out.
4020155	4024879	Number 10 is Professor Kalashima's Brain Training, How Old Is Your Brain?
4026780	4030323	And number 9 is Wii Sports.
4032957	4034257	Number 8 is Viva Pinata.
4034998	4036519	I guess I need to actually play that, huh?
4038020	4039861	7 is Gears of War.
4039881	4043343	6 is Lego Star Wars 2.
4044885	4052590	Those games are actually pretty fun, but I got really pissed off at the one that came out a year before.
4052610	4060435	5 is Dead Rising, because there's something really awesome about running over zombies with a lawnmower and cutting their heads off with a scythe.
4061817	4063078	4 is Final Fantasy XII.
4064679	4069062	3 is The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, which Dan and I are currently playing through.
4069923	4071544	2 is Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
4072825	4076848	And the number one game is... Your mom.
4076968	4077568	Cooking Mama.
4077789	4078589	No, Guitar Hero.
4079650	4080030	Really?
4080230	4081691	Yes, Guitar Hero won number one.
4082072	4083813	Oh, because that just came out in Europe this year.
4084640	4086102	Ah, okay, okay, I can see that.
4086463	4092911	And to quote one of the folks from Eurogamer, Keza, it says, if you don't like Guitar Hero, you have no soul.
4095042	4098284	I have to admit, though, I'm getting a little... I'm a little burned out on Guitar Hero.
4098544	4099625	I'm a little burned out on it.
4099725	4104727	I mean, it's not God's gift to video games like the media is portraying it to be.
4104787	4105528	It's really not.
4105688	4108089	I love Guitar Hero, but I found out I can't play it drunk.
4108289	4113412	I feel like I've been playing music games for years, and not to sound elitist or anything, so I'm sorry if I sound that way.
4114192	4117154	I understand Guitar Hero made the music game genre more accessible.
4117194	4117774	Don't get me wrong.
4117814	4119115	And I do think it's a good game.
4119135	4120416	I think it's a great game, in fact.
4120776	4121997	But I don't think it's like, you know, aww.
4123197	4124738	Sound the chorus of angels.
4124758	4127300	Fucking Guitar Freaks 2DX, basically.
4127720	4128281	That's what it is.
4128461	4130622	I feel like I've kind of seen this before.
4130983	4132083	What's so freaking great about it?
4132103	4144251	But I guess it's just that it made it more accessible through the fact that as much as we have loved Konami's Bomani title, they've never really fully been Americanized, if that makes sense.
4144291	4146913	So whenever they try to Americanize them, it doesn't always work.
4147273	4150996	Because I think they're letting the Japanese teams Americanize the games, and that doesn't work.
4154373	4158115	Speaking of top 10s, I never posted mine to the site, so I'm going to read it for you now.
4158475	4159836	Would you like to know my top 10 games of 2006?
4159976	4161437	That's okay.
4161878	4162318	Well, too bad.
4162338	4163839	I'm going to tell you anyway.
4164940	4166141	I did like Eurogamer's List, though.
4166161	4167221	You know why I like Eurogamer's List?
4167241	4172725	It's because I like their reviews over there, because they will tell it like it is over there.
4172765	4173966	So that was interesting to hear that.
4174406	4178849	But now mine, and here's the ones that I thought were the 10 best games of 2006.
4179890	4182171	Number 10, I said Sneak King on the 360.
4183573	4187076	And I know you might think I'm crazy, but get this.
4187316	4195282	It was an original title, the game was four bucks, and it was probably better than most of the games that Xbox released in arcade for five or more.
4195622	4199905	So if you think about it, it's one of the best gaming values of the year, and it absolutely deserves recognition.
4200946	4203047	I think it came off better than anyone thought it would.
4203147	4210713	So, you know, Sneak King, I know it seems weird to put it on a top ten list, but I felt it needed some type of recognition for kind of what it did.
4210993	4212414	It did something really, really original.
4213551	4216130	Number 9, I said Phantasy Star Universe
4216784	4223626	and the reason why I said that is because you have massive replayability over previous versions of Phantasy Star Online in my mind.
4223726	4237370	You have single player mode and that would be the type of game that usually you'd think would be sold by itself but on top of that you have the online mode, rationed unlocks that kind of keep the game going and makes the world ever expanding, keeps online mode fresh.
4237450	4243031	Number eight, I said Kingdom Hearts 2 which I think far too many people overlooked amongst the 2006 releases.
4243151	4245272	It was an epic game in every sense of the word.
4245832	4254600	Make improvements to the original, kept a fresh storyline, and even if you consider that some of the old worlds from the first game return, I mean, they kept it fresh.
4254640	4255201	It's amazing.
4255301	4263748	Yes, it has a three-hour opening, but the fact that it's got, like, the year's probably one of the best soundtracks of the year, amazing visuals, and fucking Tron World.
4264569	4265029	Enough said.
4265430	4265970	Tron World.
4266651	4267432	One of the best games of the year.
4267832	4269894	Number seven, I said Trauma Center Second Opinion.
4270834	4273196	Nintendo certainly knows how to milk its retro franchises for all they are worth.
4295363	4296363	but New Super Mario Bros.
4296403	4320727	takes this old formula gives it a kick in the pants this is the game people wanted on the GameCube everybody wanted to see a game like this on the GameCube and for whatever reason Nintendo said now we'll put it on the DS and it's like people read our minds and they got it when you know we say that the next generation of gaming you don't have to make everything in 3D you can make visually appealing 2D games and New Super Mario Bros.
4320767	4323768	was it so definitely it was one of the best titles of the year
4325282	4326603	Dead Rising Dead Rising
4352725	4355966	Having a fresh story, and the battle system is phenomenal.
4356547	4362049	And it feels simple in the game's first hours, but as you play more, it gets so engaging, and it's great.
4362769	4364290	16.99 widescreen support in the U.S.
4364370	4368492	helps the game kind of keep up with the next gen of gaming.
4369312	4377616	Unfortunately, I think it was maybe released a little too late for enough people to notice this title, but it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy role-playing games at all.
4378960	4380601	Elite Beat Agents Elite Beat Agents
4397882	4400764	Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess
4418377	4418677	CookieMama!
4418717	4419138	CookieMama!
4419178	4419478	CookieMama!
4449788	4453309	Loki, I'll read them off and you can explain your picks if you want.
4453629	4455890	Well, you should read off what I put on there because it was funny.
4456470	4457051	Fine, hold on.
4457091	4457371	Let's see.
4457391	4457831	What do we got?
4458431	4460092	I have... Okay, here we go.
4460852	4462373	Loki picked Final Fantasy XII.
4462413	4464234	It's the number 10 best game of the year.
4464674	4469936	I'm sure somewhere in the video game top list guidelines it says we are required to put at least one Final Fantasy game in any top 10 list.
4470217	4471657	So this year it's Final Fantasy XII.
4471757	4473618	It's sexy, new, and everyone wants to be it.
4473938	4474779	It'll be its friends.
4475219	4478020	That is until Final Fantasy XIII comes out, all 50 different versions of it.
4479278	4480519	I think these are in no particular order also.
4480539	4480999	Oh, really?
4481099	4481740	It's just my top ten.
4505713	4506194	Well, too bad.
4506434	4507335	I'm assuming this is the order.
4507875	4509396	I didn't realize Super Mario Bros.
4509816	4510997	3.5 could be so much fun.
4511358	4513519	I guess you can't beat the old 2D platformer days.
4513919	4515961	I just hope we get some more like this on every system.
4516541	4518023	Number 6 was Gears of War.
4518503	4519904	The killer app before Halo 3.
4520264	4521966	A very intense and albeit hard game.
4522626	4524047	Number 5 was Twilight Princess.
4524127	4525608	We've waited so long for a new Zelda.
4525668	4527049	It's everything we could have wanted.
4528551	4530252	Number 4 was Excite Truck.
4531033	4532475	I guess that's why you said this is no order.
4532735	4536139	Who in their right mind would put Excite Truck above Twilight Princess, you idiot?
4536940	4537260	Me?
4537640	4538742	Okay, read.
4539422	4542966	It looks like Nintendo's BEA to the punch for a burnout off-road.
4543086	4548332	A great launch game for the Wii that converted at least two non-gamers, my wife and extrovert, into full-fledged gamers.
4549013	4549934	Alright, that's a good point.
4550435	4550755	Good point.
4551376	4552497	Number three, Saints Row.
4553429	4555050	It's like Grand Theft Auto 3.5.
4555730	4560892	I've spent countless lunches hurling grenades and rockets at cops while speeding away in my riced-out minifan.
4561133	4563994	I'll be playing this game until Saints Row 2 comes out, or Grand Theft Auto 4.
4565014	4568636	According to Loki, the number two best game of the year was Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
4569136	4576459	I have to give props to a game that would let me rob a guild bear, punch a deer, and set fire to civilians in the course of one day and wearing nothing but a loincloth.
4576639	4577220	Well said.
4577440	4578080	Well said.
4579383	4584927	and the number one game according to Loki in 2006, and I totally disagree, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
4585568	4593453	Despite its incredibly flawed targeting system and rather frustrating glitches, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories is the most fun you'll ever have on the PSP ad hoc multiplayer.
4594194	4599258	I can only hope that GTA 4 is up to this level of fun, just for the love of God, beta the multiplayer more than five minutes.
4599578	4605522	And I think exactly for those reasons, the fact that it had some bad beta-ing, you should not have put that game anywhere near your top ten.
4605983	4607904	It was in no particular order, that's why I put it there.
4608462	4636873	so, whatever alright, there you go and then NM64 says Loki admitted his wife's a gamer JVmon says Rob, I would put Excite Truck before Zelda I don't know you guys it's a good game I think Excite Truck is horribly underrated and it probably would be in my top 15 but the worst part about Excite Truck is it was too short that's it that's the worst part about it alright, Jamie has a list she'd like to share my number 10 is actually DDR Supernova
4637628	4642051	Just because it's bringing DDR back to the arcade, giving everybody what they want.
4642791	4643752	And I think that's a good thing.
4643812	4646474	It's sort of helped rebuilding the whole community, and that makes me happy.
4647414	4651417	And 9 is the Super Mario Bros., just because it's Super Mario Bros., and that game's actually kind of hard.
4651437	4657281	8 is Resistance Fall of Man, because it's pretty, and you explode heads and stuff.
4658277	4682751	and I actually like Guitar Hero 2 so it's on there for my number 7 and number 6 is Trauma Center because that game is fucking frustrating and evil and has people screaming loudly at their DS's and then 5 is Wii Sports because it's actually kind of fun 4 would be Zelda 3 is Pirates of the Caribbean Pinball What?
4683232	4683532	Okay
4684674	4686715	You really thought outside the box for your picks.
4687036	4688677	Well, you are a pinball whore, I'll take it.
4688977	4690378	No, I'm married to a pinball whore.
4691118	4691959	I understand, I understand.
4693300	4696542	Two is going to be all the Flash games on the Doctor Who website.
4696782	4699404	Oh my god, you loser.
4699664	4701465	Your list just lost all credibility.
4701485	4701545	Hey!
4702886	4707229	I like the game where he's the drawing and you have to walk him through the thing.
4707429	4707849	Failed.
4708530	4708830	Clank.
4709290	4711111	And one is Cooking Mama.
4711812	4712172	Of course.
4713373	4714594	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
4716214	4720716	You're the only gamer girl I can think of that would put Cooking Mama at the top of her list with pride.
4721416	4722157	Very well done.
4722397	4723137	It's great!
4723597	4724958	Cooking Mama is awesome!
4725958	4728439	Next year, her number one game will be driving training.
4729019	4729280	What?!
4730080	4731000	Because, you know, you're a woman.
4734182	4735062	This is good radio.
4736185	4761242	and on that note we should probably go to break while DarkSakura kicks my ass out in the parking lot so we'll be back after this with we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio Part B Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
