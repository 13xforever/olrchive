Tonight, January 28th, 2007, Wii gets a new channel and rumors circulate of another, Sony gets confused about its own game, and a new PC release shatters sales records.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, the gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
I'm here to help you through the next few hours.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Roar.
How you doing?
Roar!
Roar!
and DarkSakura.com.
I know, but I was saying it for the sake of the noise that it was making.
It was pretty bad.
The death noise.
You want to know what death metal is?
Just let your brakes grind.
I thought her tire was flat, actually, is what I thought it was.
And then I got out of the car and I poked all the tires and they were fine.
I said, oh, you're fucked.
Rob probed my car.
I did.
It was great.
You're the one who had the probe.
Say hello as well to the always probing Techmaster Loki.
You might want to turn that mic on so you can talk to us tonight.
Hello.
Hey, how you doing?
Good.
217 weeks, we're still having difficulty turning on our microphone.
Yeah, I don't check these things.
And I turned it off, too.
I was the one that did that, so.
How was your week?
You had a pretty good week?
Yeah, it was okay.
That was good.
I apologize in advance.
I've kind of lost my voice somewhat tonight.
You're going to hear that my voice is kind of scratchy, and I'm doing my best trying to drink some tea and coffee, but...
Those folks that have emailed us or posted on web forums that Rob talks too much on the show.
Rob should shut up once in a while.
You're probably going to get your wish tonight because, as you can hear, I'm strained a little bit.
We've got some emergency for you.
I know.
I'm probably going to drink some a little later, but I need hot drinks for the throat, so I've been drinking some green tea.
Boil it.
We'll make some coffee later.
Boil it.
It'll be lovely and nasty.
I might try it.
We'll see.
I can drink whatever.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
Um, I played a little bit more Cooking Mama, um, I haven't really had time to play much of anything as far as actual games go, um, although I'm really thinking I'm gonna actually, um, stick with Guild Wars for my game of choice, um, I might play, um, World of Warcraft, but right now I really don't have time with school, my education really is, is the focus, but last night I was over here while Rob was off in, uh, Rocky Land, and, uh, I was watching, uh,
and Miklatov played through Silent Hill 2, which was awesome, but it wasn't scary to me.
There's only, like, one thing that really freaked me out, and I don't even remember what that... I think it was climbing down the ladder and having, you know, Pyramid Head just be there, and that spooked me a little bit, so... That was really it.
Oh, and I played some pinball.
I downloaded a game for my phone, though.
I downloaded Pac-Man pinball, and it's ass.
What's wrong with it?
It's just boring.
It's not very...
It's two fields and that's it.
Is it just a normal pinball game?
Yeah.
Stupid.
Sounds boring.
They should do virtual pinball for the phones.
I can play Black Knight.
Are there cell phone games you enjoy?
Because there's only one or two I enjoy.
I have two that I play and that's Luminous and Bejeweled.
The only two I play are Luminous and Super Pac-Man.
You know, Super Pac-Man is really hard to play on my phone.
I would much rather play it on an arcade machine or something, but it's not bad for on the go.
I did delete virtual pinball off of my computer because it turned out that I had no space left and I managed to free up 17 gig.
Jesus.
Oh yeah.
On a 250 gigabyte hard drive.
It's all the TV I'm downloading.
Thanks to certain people who are trying to get me into watching Heroes.
It worked.
Bite my ass.
I'm going to also introduce our invisible fourth guest who's always here with us every week.
That's the chat room because Orange Lounge Radio, we believe in letting you guys be a part of our program.
So if you're listening live to us here on this Sunday evening, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on chat or I believe you can also just go to chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
I think our lovely webmaster VX Jason XV set that up quite some time ago and I keep forgetting to announce it that way.
I want to say hi to the noobs.
I know Godlike93 introduced himself as a chatroom noob tonight.
So hi noob!
I think I recognize all the other names.
If I missed any other noobs in chat tonight, I apologize.
The chatroom is pretty much being very foul as to why I have no voice tonight.
NM64 said Sky ate too many dicks.
Screw you.
Screw you.
I just screamed a lot.
I said the F word repeatedly very loudly and that's why I have no voice today.
Of course that doesn't really help, that story does.
No, it does not.
Never mind.
I think I want to edit that out of the show, but we don't do that.
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was fun.
We played, I actually finished Resistance finally, and it's, the end's kind of okay.
They're definitely making another one.
Didn't get a chance to play multiplayer though, I should have done that, but I was too busy playing Crackdown, the demo, and I played that about
Oh, six or seven times all the way through, so, you know, that's over three hours of crackdown, and it's a fun game.
That's exactly what I was hoping it would be.
I mean, it's the perfect game for me because you're this overpowered, like, almost like a superhero type character, just abusing the crap out of the citizens that live in this, you know, one city.
And then I did get to play last night a multiplayer with JeremyTodd100, and it was...
That was fun.
We just kept busting up just how retarded things got.
I kind of couldn't get into the Crackdown demo, but I played it when I didn't have a lot of time to spend with it.
But you and I need to set a time so you can show me what the hell I'm supposed to do in that game.
Because it looks like it's pretty.
It looks like it might be fun.
When you actually sit down and look at some of the detail in it, I mean, there's a lot of cars and people in that, which is a lot more than, say, Saints Row or something like that.
I do like just the amount of detail in it.
and just the fact that when you're not going around and trying to kill people you can climb a lot of stuff in there and that's actually kind of fun also it's kind of a different aspect of the game they reward you for that too in fact one of the achievements is climbing the tower that you start off in and that thing is high I managed to get up about 20, 30, 40 stories and they jumped off of it and landed on a cop to my enjoyment we both exploded once I hit the ground
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
gang leaders in this already in 30 minutes.
Wasn't there some footnote in the demo, though, that said it was moving at an accelerated pace, like the skills was accelerated?
Yeah, the skills were moving, you know, a bit faster, but, you know, if you spend enough time with it leveling up, you just kick the crap out of everybody later on, which is fine, you know, because it's fun.
But co-op is definitely where it's at, and just, I really wish there was more than two players, but even what was kind of weird, though, when you're playing co-op, there was lag, but there was lag on, like,
My end.
Like, I would move and it would be delayed on my screen, which is kind of weird.
But it was fun.
I liked it.
So I can't wait to check out the full game.
All right.
Is that it?
I think that's it, yeah.
All right.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I think it kind of proves that putting Heavenly Star in the game was a bit of an afterthought I think it's kind of weird that Heavenly Star is the only song available right now too like don't you remember at E3 there was supposed to be Madonna and they were talking about they were getting together Warner Brothers Records to get all these you know songs you know where did those show up because I think it would have been better if they released a few of those for you know I don't know 400 points or whatever released several of those and had a mode for that like music video mode because the only place that Heavenly Star really works for me is using it in skin edit mode
and when I'm playing it in skin edit mode I don't really play the whole song because you move on to the next skin after four levels and I'm actually getting better at Luminous so I can usually get through four levels in about half the song.
But I can't complain.
It's free.
And I think I applaud Microsoft and Q Entertainment for trying to correct some of the micro transaction mistakes they made by making this content so cheap right now and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Let's see, the other game I played was World of Warcraft.
Honestly, I've been getting sucked back into World of Warcraft.
I'm a little 20-torn druid now, which I know some people are probably like, I can do that in no time flat.
Well, you know what?
I have a job.
I have other stuff to do.
I'm having a lot of fun with it.
We've got a guild growing.
We have some OLR listeners in it.
We're over on the Ravencrest server.
If you want to join us, check out the forums for more details.
We're not called OL Army, though.
It's a Silent Hill-based name, actually, for whatever reason.
Shane's running the guild, and that's what he picked.
Miklatov.
You know him as Miklatov on the show.
That's what he picked.
And it's a good name for a Horde guild.
So Horde side, Ravencrest.
Visit the
Orange Launch Radio forums for more detail at OrangeLaunchRadio.com And that's it.
That's pretty much all my gaming week.
Not anything else major.
Just some other little bits here and there.
I think I might have played a game of Heavy Weapon.
That's about it.
Oh yeah, I played Heavy Weapon.
Lame.
You didn't like it?
No, I thought it was stupid.
I thought it was way better than most of the stuff they've been releasing lately.
Oh, that was dumb.
Really?
I'm glad I didn't buy it.
You know what I didn't?
Zeldon Virtual Console
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and I tried to play Gradius the other night.
That is one of the gameplays.
I played Gradius on the Wii and I sucked.
I couldn't get past the volcanoes in the first level because I swore I was going to do it without cheating.
I can't go back and play Nintendo Gradius though.
I have to play one of the later releases of it.
Does my hand-eye coordination get that bad with age?
You're just old, Rob.
I guess so.
uh comments from chat room JeremyTodd1 says everyone has to buy a link to the past I don't care who you are what you do buy it anyway this game is the best game ever I agree it's probably one of the top five games of all time um HitStun says Heavy Weapon is nice by PopCap standards but that doesn't make it a good game I disagree um
XBS Kid adds on to that saying the PopCap standard is the bottom of the barrel next to Flash games.
I don't know.
There's some pretty crappy stuff on Xbox Live outside the PopCap stuff.
At least there's some playability there.
I don't know.
I disagree.
I don't think PopCap's the best thing ever, OMG, but I think some of the stuff they put out is pretty decent.
Bob Coffee says, don't give in to World of Warcraft.
Too late.
Alpha Canogram says, Sky, I love Heavenly Star.
I'm just annoyed that I can't turn off the sound effects because sometimes I want to hear the actual song while playing.
Yeah, you know how on Luminous, you know, with the songs in the background, the little, like, rotating the shapes will make a noise, and clearing a block off the screen will make a noise?
Some of that does get in the way of the song.
But I don't mind.
And for Shinin', though, wow.
Yeah, and Shinin', it was incredible.
I don't mind it in Heavily Star.
And I think, like, in Hollaback Girl, it's funny, if you have the PSP one.
By the way, I saw Luminous Plus on PS2 for sale the other day, and I remember what you were telling me about how it's, like, it went down in price, right?
Luminous Plus on PS2?
Um, yeah, it's $19.99.
It should be out, though.
It's not coming out until, like, way later.
No, they had it on shelves at a place I went to at a GameStop, which you're usually pretty good about.
Yeah, Luminous Plus doesn't come out until the end of next month.
For real?
I should have bought it.
I swear, they had, like, 40 copies sitting right there on the shelf behind the little thing.
Luminous Plus.
Huh.
Maybe something happened.
Yeah, they shouldn't have that yet.
That's weird.
I'm going to check the web and see if it...
Maybe if they change the price, they bumped up the release date.
I don't really want to get it on PS2, though.
That's too many versions.
I have Xbox Live.
That's good enough.
Then again, it would depend on the songs.
Do they have some good licensed song in Luminous Plus, or is it just a port of the PSP version?
I think it's just a port of the PSP version.
Then forget it.
Forget it.
I don't care, then.
All right.
and DarkSakura.com
So, if you want to vote for an alternative, I suppose you can always vote for Travis.
So, if you want more details, listen to his show.
Saturday nights at 7 o'clock, but not this upcoming week.
DMN's going to call us later in the show because they scored a huge interview for this week.
I'm pretty jealous.
And, Jamie, you are going to be pissed when you find out who it is.
That's all I have to say.
I will.
You're going to be pissed that they're not on this show.
Okay.
Yeah, you're going to want to reach to the screen and punch DMN.
Okay.
It's pretty good.
He'll call in later in the program.
Okay.
DarkSakura wanted to start off tonight's program a little bit, and we promised we wouldn't bring this story up again, but
DarkSakura had something she wanted to say.
She wanted to talk about last week and us talking about it.
And I'll just turn it over to her.
So, DarkSakura, what do you want to say?
Yeah, about the whole two-gallon water drowning lady.
Jennifer Strange, yes?
Yeah, sorry.
Hold your wee for a wee?
KDND?
I can only remember her last name for some reason.
Well, it was pretty strange.
I got all of three emails about it.
One of them was just stupid, and I immediately disregarded it because...
If you want to make a valid point, don't start off by calling people names and being an idiot, because then I don't respect you, and I will never pay attention to anything you say.
Was it like a fuck you, you fucking fuck type of email?
Yeah, I'm like, you're an idiot, next.
I did, however, receive one that really, I want to say it was a well thought out letter, and I appreciate it.
And just because, and I'm going to go ahead and say this, I am, God, chat room, knock it off, shit.
What I was going to say before the chat room started acting like they had Tourette's is that I even went back and said, yeah, I don't think it was necessarily a matter of deserving it, but I come from the point of view of accountability for what you do.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
that it was my choice to get on the roller coaster in the first place.
But what a way to go.
I know, wouldn't that be awesome?
But a friend of mine equated it though with, you know, if you go out, if you're a woman going out at midnight to 7-11, there's a chance that you can get pounced in the alleyway and raped.
Well, that's the difference.
She wasn't forced down onto the ground and forced water down her throat.
She actually chose to do it after there was a warning calling in, after they were saying, do you feel sick?
Do you need to stop?
People
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I just think that she had a choice, and that's what I'm saying.
I just don't think people should discount the fact that she did have free will involved.
And that's what people are doing.
Hopefully we can all get past this story, because I know I'm kind of sick of hearing about it, especially living here.
Because keep in mind, this was in our backyard, and we are hearing about this nonstop.
It's in our paper every day, some type of new development.
On top of that, I talked it over with several of my coworkers, lots of my friends, and everyone's saying, did we learn about this in middle school?
If you saturate your body with water without replacing sodium, your brain's not going to function.
That you learn in middle school.
And for me, my whole thing is just that I don't... Yeah, the radio station fully, they are fully responsible.
Well, not I'd say fully responsible, but they should be the ones punished for the event, not her.
I think that what happened to her is a horrible tragedy.
But I think that people should just not say...
She had no part in the blame.
I hate the word blame.
I just think that people should understand she did choose to participate.
I don't think this should have happened to her.
I don't think any of that should have happened.
But just let her be accountable.
Let her be posthumously accountable and not the big bad victim.
Because we're a country of victims and it's sickening.
All right.
Well, I'm going to try and keep the show moving, but I do want to say this, just kind of a friendly reminder that Orange on Radio, part of the reason why we're here is to let gamers all have their voice, whether you may agree with it or not.
And sometimes it's on a very superficial level, where it's Nintendo versus Sony versus Microsoft.
And sometimes we call Sony executives names, and you may not agree with that.
And sometimes...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Blunt opinions and controversial opinions sometimes, and you may not always agree with it, but we do have the right to have that voice nevertheless.
I don't agree with Jamie 100% on this particular thing, but she has the right to say it, and I defend her right to say it.
So I also want to kind of get that out, because if you're going to email me saying Jamie should be off the show, that's not going to do any good.
Did somebody do that?
You were CC'd on it.
Oh, was it that?
Yeah, we'll talk later.
But it was...
Yeah, I'm going to be off of the show that I helped make.
That's not going to happen.
That's stupid.
Because she, you know, even if I disagree with her, I think part of the lure of the show is that I can hear her thoughts.
Firebomb had pointed it out.
It said, but she's a woman and she therefore has no opinion.
Why is it?
And the only complaints I got were from men.
Well...
To be fair, we probably have just more men than women that listen to this show, and that's just the culture we're in.
I notice, though, in general, that any time I could say something and Matt could say the exact same thing, but I'm the one that gets the emails about it, that I should be quiet.
You know what?
Hello, universe.
I'm a woman.
I have an opinion, and you're going to fucking shut up and listen to it, so fuck you.
And that's how I feel.
But at the same time, you have the right to express your rebuttal arguments with your intelligent emails and phone calls we do later in this program.
Jamie's not totally shut off to hearing what else you guys might have to say.
No, seriously.
You present your rebuttal to me in an intelligent way.
I'm more than happy to discuss it with you.
I think we can agree to disagree, but I love to hear.
I invite anybody.
If you've got an opposite opinion to what I have, I love debate.
Oh, my God.
So prove it.
Bring it.
I will discuss with you until the cows come home.
Yeah, we had a bunch of stories, and not just, you know, release dates and stuff.
For example, we had a follow-up to, you know, a game we talked about we announced originally on episode 206, High School Musical the Game, which, you know, to me, I mean, I wasn't too interested about this.
It is coming out for the Wii and PlayStation 2.
It's based on the Disney Channel, like, musical that they're apparently selling very well on DVD and stuff.
But what's actually kind of made it more interesting for me, and as we put on the website earlier this week, High School Musical The Game is actually going to be featuring a microphone peripheral for the Wii, which is kind of neat.
So apparently you're going to be singing karaoke.
I'm not sure if it's going to be an actual, you know, its own unit, like its own controller, or if it's going to be something that plugs into the bottom of the Wiimote.
But either way, you're going to be singing karaoke with this thing.
It is going to be coming out now.
In August, $69.99 for the bundle.
And that's kind of interesting to see some actual companies making some attachments for the Wii other than, say, some stupid steering wheel like the Ubisoft games.
But that was kind of neat.
Other stuff we announced this week, including...
There's going to be a brand new PSP game coming out based on the Girls Gone Wild franchise and it's actually a pool themed game.
Originally it was going to be called Pocket Pool by itself and then they picked up the Girls Gone Wild license and now Eidos is producing it and basically it's going to be your standard billiards game but you unlock nudie pictures so who doesn't like some good nudie pictures?
Which is hilarious.
I think that's a great name for the game by the way.
It's hilarious.
And then finally we've got
Well, actually, some other stuff.
Ubisoft, they announced Brothers in Arms War Stories for the DS.
Now, I've been reading some other sites out there saying that they've heard the same thing, but they're getting their info from the ESRB website because it was listed on there.
But either way, it is coming for the DS.
It's going to be coming out on June 13th for $29.99 and should be some interesting stuff.
Also, there was a little bit of elaboration for Driver 76, as I mentioned a few episodes back.
And then, of course, um...
Sega's Virtua Fighter 5, and this is also, you know, the street dates have been listed on other sites.
But according to Sega themselves, they signed a six-month exclusive contract with Sony for the PlayStation exclusivity of it.
Where did you hear this?
Because I haven't heard this anywhere else about this six-month deal.
I heard this actually from Sega because they came into our Dallas office yesterday.
to do, you know, kind of their lineup of stuff, and I was questioning them about, you know, dates and stuff.
At least I was emailing our buyer about dates, and she said that they're on a six-month exclusive deal.
So, and that, I know GameStop had a tentative date on their website as, what was it, August something.
It was towards the end of August, but it would be six months from when it's actually released in February for the PlayStation 3.
So, but, um,
Yeah, so that's kind of interesting.
And, yeah, as far as, that was the exclusive news we had.
Oh, I'm sorry, and then of course my favorite one here.
The two Konami Wii titles that are going to be coming out in March.
They announced Wing Island and Kororinpa Marble Mania is going to be coming out as well for the Wii.
Both are going to be pretty reasonably priced, only $39.99 for each.
Both coming out on the 28th.
of March.
So I'm sure we'll have more info about that next week after Konami's Gamer's Day.
But that was some interesting stuff.
Wait, was that Koro as in like C-H-O-R-O or Koro as in... K-O-R-O.
Okay.
Because I want another Koro game.
Anyways, there was some other stuff, other announcements regarding dates as well.
This one, Rob, you're going to like.
Elevator Action for the Wii.
It's coming out on June 13th.
That's a pretty rad arcade game.
I'd be curious to see what they do with it.
Yeah.
And, of course, Bladestorm's been delayed on the PlayStation 3 to June 15th as well.
Call of Juarez for the Xbox 360 is coming out on June 15th.
And Turok for the PlayStation 3 and 360 also going to be coming out in September on the 12th.
So, lots of good stuff.
And I'll, of course, be posting more dates to our under-the-radar thread that we have on the forums.
So, keep an eye on that.
I will.
All right, well, speaking of the Wii, I guess we're getting elevator action pretty soon, and now we're getting rumors about new channels that could be coming to the Wii.
I mean, when the Wii went out and they first announced the Wii, we all knew we were going to be getting, you know, the forecast channel, the news channel, the internet channel at some point.
Well, now there are rumors of a game channel, and this was spurred by remarks that were made by John Lee, who is the Hudson Entertainment Director of Marketing.
He didn't say anything too specific about it, but when he was asked about downloadable games for the Wii, this was his quote, quote, however, in the future, you should rephrase that question to, are there any plans to launch original content on some downloadable service on the Wii, and you might get a different answer.
Now, Nintendo, of course, said, you know, we cannot confirm what format the new content will be delivered.
There will be original games at the Wii Shop eventually.
But it could be interesting because this is launching speculation.
It might be just a whole new channel to separate classic Nintendo titles and these, you know, downloadable titles in a new channel by itself.
Why couldn't he just not be a jackass about the whole thing?
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
I can't answer your question because you didn't ask me the correct question.
Riddle me this!
You know, there are NDAs and things, so I think he's trying to think of a clever way around it.
I don't think he's a jackass.
But then, I mean, there's just like, it's like, you know, if you're asking, say, for example, imagine you're asking Sony when the PlayStation 3 is going to be coming out in the UK or something like that.
You're like, so, when are you guys going to be releasing the PlayStation 3 in the UK?
I'm sorry, you did not ask the correct question.
Misquestion in the form of a walrus.
Like Jeopardy
Firebomb asks an interesting question out of left field here a little bit.
It says, weren't we supposed to have different colors for Wii consoles by now?
I want to say I read a story.
It's not in our show world tonight, but I want to say I read a story somewhere on the internet earlier this week about that, yeah, they were going to do different colors, but since they're having trouble keeping the gray ones on shelves as it is, that the new colors are going to be quite some ways off.
New colors will be something they do when they want to sell more systems.
They're not going to do it right now.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Dually shit that you don't need for it.
It's very interesting to see how the Wii is.
You know, I'm just thinking about this because I read it today.
One of my friends on LiveJournal, my old roommate, who wasn't much of a gamer.
Remember the very first OLR studio, my roommate there?
He wasn't that super into games.
He always kind of thought the show he did was kind of weird, but he thought it was cool, right?
Well, he made this post in LiveJournal today about how he wants a Wii because he played one over the weekend.
He thought it was awesome.
He says, I don't really get into video games, but the Wii was fun.
It's very interesting to read things like that.
It's so interesting to read from the not...
Take some time away from the game blogs once in a while to read what other people have to say.
It's just very interesting.
I think Nintendo's very, very happy at a reaction like that.
That was their goal, was it not?
I suppose it was.
Well, we have actually a little bit more coming from Nintendo, specifically about the channels.
The news channel, there's a pretty good review of it, I found.
Have you... I've played with the news channel.
I played with that a little bit this week.
It was fun.
Well, basically, the news channel, and this is a couple things that I like about it.
It seems like it's got pretty easy browsing to it.
It brings up your local news based on your area.
You can click on Globe, though, and it shows you where you are in relation to the rest of the world.
That's pretty cool.
You can also, there's a slideshow.
You can see the headlines come through at the bottom half, and you pick wherever.
You bring up any of the stories that come up on the slideshow by pressing A. It's pretty easy to follow, I think.
It's looking like, they said that the relaunch of it is going to be later this year and it's going to be free and offer more regions available for viewing.
But so far it seems so, you know, so far so good pretty much.
I actually like it quite a bit.
I like it more than I like the forecast channel.
But my only suggestion for the news channel would be that, you know how the forecast channel has the temperature and things in the Wii browser?
Like you don't have to launch the forecast channel just to see the temperature, although it's horribly out of date, at least for this region.
Like it never updates after midnight or 6 a.m.
Like it never updates for the rest of the day.

You have links to news articles usually or RSS feeds that run kind of along the side of your email.
And sometimes that's what makes me stop and go, oh, that sounds interesting.
That's actually why I stopped using most of those because my email is through my friend Julie's server and I don't have to worry about any of that.
But I don't mind it.
That's why I have a Yahoo page.
That's why I use Firefox ad block and stuff.
But yeah, when you use Yahoo Mail, it shows you some of the top headlines.
I stopped using Yahoo Mail just because of that.
I like to have my news where I can, you know, if I'm going for news, I'm going specifically for news.
That's why the first thing that I have pull up is my Yahoo page and I have my world events and all that listing.
I would really, though, this is my hope.
I'm not quite sure what their news source is.
But I hope that they don't go with... Associated Press.
They have a two-year agreement with Associated Press.
Okay.
Well, I still... I'm very leery about most of our press publications just because there's a lot of bias, a lot of...
Well, you know what I thought was hilarious is, you know, of course, one of the first places I went to look for stories locally once I got to the globe was Sacramento.
And guess what the top news story was in the Sacramento region on the news channel was about the, you know, again, here's more news in the hold your wee for a wee thing as if we could have more.
I was reading BBC News and saw crap on it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So it was interesting that that was on the news channel.
And you could even see a picture of a PlayStation 3, and it was kind of one of those moments.
It was like the very first time you see the Nintendo and Sega logos on the screen together, like when you boot up F-Zero.
It was one of those moments, like looking at a picture of a PlayStation 3 on your Wii.
It was weird.
It was very awkward.
Or like you with your Elebits icon on Xbox Live.
That's true.
My Friends list icon on Xbox Live is an Elebit, so I guess it's not the first time.
And you know, at one time, my background was a picture of Mario Kart.
Because that was when I was playing around with using backgrounds from the computer.
So, just fun to do little things like that, I suppose.
I like irony.
Anyways, speaking about the Wii, there's going to be some fun stuff coming to the Virtual Console soon.
And one of the biggest games coming to the Virtual Console, and only to Trump, was it last week's Link to the Past?
Legend of Zelda The Ocarina of Time is going to be heading to at least the Japanese Virtual Console in February.
It's going to be slated for 1,200 points and of course is going to make it to the United States shortly after the Japanese one, if not the same day.
That's awesome.
Not interested.
Okay, well that's awesome for other people.
I'm not interested either because I had it on GameCube for the longest time.
Exactly.
And the Wii can play GameCube games.
So what's the point?
Like, I, you know, I understand.
Sometimes people go like, well, Rob, then why do you bother downloading anything on there at all when you can just use emulators?
Okay, because I can't use emulators on my TV with a wireless remote.
I'm just too lazy to set that thing up.
And I like the authentic experience.
But using that little GameCube disc with the Zelda game on it is a pretty authentic experience.
Yeah.
So...
I don't get the point of downloading it.
I'm going to be downloading Mario Kart.
But here's the best part, though.
When this game does come out, it's going to be great, and people are going to download it and stuff.
Then later on down the line, remember how they were talking about, oh, yeah, well, we can do a line of games, and thank the Game Boy Advance here when they released the old Nintendo games for it again.
We can do a line of games that are just GameCube and maybe Nintendo 64 games ported over with the controls for the Wii.
So you'd have Mario Kart Double Dash or whatever ported over and being sold for $29.99 or something like that with just no changes whatsoever other than the controls for the Wii.
Watch this kind of happen or they release some sort of collector's edition of all the Zelda games or something again.
I'm reading what the chat room has to say on this.
Jeremy Todd 1 says, I have played and beat Ocarina of Time a few too many times now.
I beat it on 64, I beat it on the GameCube, I beat it on the computer, whistles, and like OLR said, I have the GameCube game so I can just play that.
GS68 would like to point out, you know, playing the Ocarina is kind of hell with the C-stick, which doesn't make sense because you didn't have the buttons on the GameCube, you had that stick.
So, well...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Kama Itachi no Yoru, Megami Tensei, Super Goals and Ghosts, Sango Kushi 4, Bare Knuckles, Streets of Rage, Beyond Oasis, Vector Man, Sword of Vermilion,
Vigilante on TurboGrafx-16, Chu Man Fu, Yokai Doshuki, and Wonder Momo also all coming out on TurboGrafx-16 so sounds like there's a lot of cool stuff coming out on your Japanese Virtual Console and many of those titles that do have American versions will probably be seeing those before too long Bare Knuckle, that brings back memories because we picked up the Japanese cart and used a converter on it to play on our Nomad and it played it as Street to Rage and it was a Bare Knuckle cart
That's weird.
How did it know that?
Sometimes they'll do that.
Actually, a lot of the Neo Geo games will have a Switch, so you can play them in either version.
Our Japanese Samurai Spirits 2 is Samurai Shodown 2, and it'll play depending on what mode we have it in.
You know what I'd like to see Nintendo do, and this is going to seem completely out of left field, but I would like to see them release some Japanese games that never got released here.
You know, and just, I mean, I guess local Freaking Panorama Cotton, hi Well, okay, that's a little obscure, but I'm thinking Earthbound on the NES, Mother Zero or whatever it's, or no, the original Mother, which we call Earthbound Zero on that translated ROM No, it wasn't a translated ROM, it was a ROM that somebody bought on eBay, which is a prototype So it's like that game is floating around there, half done Wouldn't that be awesome if that, like, came out on the virtual console?
I agree I don't know
Maybe that's just too much work, but I can't believe that Nintendo isn't making an arm and a leg off a lot of these Virtual Console games.
We need the freaking TurboGrafx Twinbee.
Oh, we'll see.
And Parodius.
We need Parodius.
We'll see.
Anyway.
Well, something that will make a lot of people happy, speaking of Virtual Console, is Mario Kart 64 is going to be on Virtual Console in Europe.
It's actually the second Nintendo 64 title to be on the European Virtual Console.
Um...
It's really, it's Mario Kart.
There's really not much else to be said about it, but there's also a notice that Soldier Blade, which is a TurboGrafx-16 game, is also going to be available for 600 points.
Well, everybody's getting in on the Mario Kart love now.
It's nice to see another Nintendo 64 title get up there, though.
And I'll tell you, Mario Kart on the 64 was the best version next to the original.
All you need is Pokemon Snap.
Toad's Highway.
End of story.
Pokemon Snap.
I would agree.
Pokemon Snap would be pretty awesome.
How about Superman 64?
Oh, fuck no.
That was so funny.
That'd be kind of cool.
Blast Corpse or something like that.
Pokemon Puzzle League Actually, GoldenEye64 You know what you'd probably like?
Dream on, it's a rare game Once they start doing the light gun games and stuff They should do... Super Scope Well, Super Scope would be awesome But the Pokemon Snap or something like that
How awesome was the Super Scope?
It was a bazooka for God's sake.
It was awesome.
I know, I think it was hard.
I remember sitting playing, because I had a Super Scope when they came out, sitting there playing freaking Blastress for long enough to wear out the battery in the Super Scope.
It was six hours.
Ooh, I have some folks agreeing with me in chat room.
Alex says, Pokemon Puzzle League FTW.
Rama says, I like Pokemon Puzzle League.
I know what's up.
I want a Super Scope just to put on my desk.
I have one.
You can probably get one at the auction.
I have one.
Do you want it?
Sure.
I'll take it.
I'll see if we can find it.
We actually have a Menacer somewhere, too.
The attachment that hooks onto the Master System gun.
JVmon's leading a chant in the chatroom for Yoshi's Safari with the Wii remote.
That might be kind of fun.
We need more Metal Slug.
What are you talking about?
There's the fucking anthologies out on Wii.
I know.
I have it.
But we need more Metal Slug anyway.
No, we don't.
I like how we did that in unison.
Great minds think like me.
Okay, no, Wrestlemania 2000 should definitely be on virtual console.
Anyways.
So, speaking of the Wii, there's one website that's actually creating sculptures of Miis, which is kind of cool.
AllisonQMcCarthy.com She's actually, well, obviously her name's not .com, but you know what I mean.
Thank you for watching.
I'll see you next time.
They should totally have a service like that.
I mean, think about it.
They're doing the same thing for Spore, where you can create your own custom stuff.
That made me think of the exact same thing, like you can print your monsters for Spore.
Dude, I'm looking at this.
I can do these.
So, I mean, I think... Well, then do it.
Make me one.
I still have to do... I have two more Dolphys to face up on.
You're a woman.
You can make things, right?
Hey, Rob, bite my ass.
But anyways... Are they like little bobbleheads?
Sort of.
I mean, they sort of look like a bobblehead.
They look like they're made from stuff at Michael's.
I think it looks cute.
They are cute, but... Make me one.
Yeah, the stuff that's on these, you can buy them at Michael's.
Why don't you put up a shut-up, Jamie?
No, seriously, I'll do one once I have time between classes.
Awesome.
I got free stuff.
So definitely keep an eye on AllisonQMcCarthy.com and maybe square yourself your own me.
How much are they charging for the Miis?
Not saying yet because I think she's just starting off with this and got picked up by everywhere and now they're getting inundated with requests.
Poor thing.
One of the downsides to getting digged.
Was that on dig?
I'm pretty sure it was.
I think it probably was.
All right.
Well, Nintendo's really digging the recent sales of the Wii.
I mean, the Wii has just been selling like crazy.
3.2 million Wiis sold is what Nintendo announced earlier this week.
That's pretty crazy.
There's not a lot else.
I mean, what else can you say about that?
They sold 3.2 million Wiis.
That's a lot.
And certainly interesting.
Now, I don't mean to sound anti-Sony.
That's not what I'm trying to do here.
But it is interesting when you see a thing like this.
Nintendo DS
I wonder if Sony is going to start pissing their pants.
I don't know.
No, they'll have some creative little press release for this.
It'll be all the drugs that Kutaragi's taking.
Blackboy in chat sums it up, says, God, Nintendo is making money hand over fist.
Nintendo is selling in a month and a half with 360 cells in a quarter.
Interesting.
Also, we have something, a comment on a story we did a little bit ago.
Cutie Honey is in chat and says, the only Metal Slug America is missing is Metal Slug 3D, which isn't terribly good.
And I think that's to go along with your comment on we need more Metal Slug.
And now I said, no, we don't.
Metal Slug has to stay two-dimensional.
That's just the awesomeness of it.
I give Metal Slug a lot of crap.
It is kind of fun.
I mean, I just give Jamie crap for it because she never shuts up about it.
But 3D, no, no, no.
Metal Slug 3D, no, no, no.
I haven't played it, but I'm not interested.
If you want to play Metal Slug going the other direction, just play Shock Troopers.
Okay.
Anyways, off the topic of Metal Slug, but still an awesome game.
Scarface is coming out.
For the Wii, and that's awesome, because apparently, I was reading on some of the features of this, you're going to be able to wield a chainsaw and use the Wiimote to chop off limbs.
Thank God, this is what we needed.
This is awesome, what are you talking about?
No, I'm serious, this really is what we needed.
Like, you know, come on.
Ever since we heard the Wii is like GameCube with a Nitro boost in it, it's like, well, then where's my fucking Resident Evil 4 with my chainsaw?
Come on.
I mean, it's just, I don't know.
Words cannot describe how happy I am.
And to be honest, I mean, I was kind of interested in the Godfather game coming out in March, but... Do you get to whack people with the Wiimote?
You do get to manhandle people, though, with the Wiimote.
Could you say that again?
Manhandle people with the Wiimote That sounds pretty fun
Well, while we wait for Scarface to come out on the Wii, he could go to a completely different genre, yet on another Nintendo system.
Remember the Game Boy Advance?
Final Fantasy 6 Advance Release
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
That's interesting because this website that I'm looking at the story on, SiliconEra.com, actually poses the same question.
Is Terra going to be Tina?
Why did they change that?
I have no idea.
Because Tina is such a bad word.
Maybe is it because Tina sounds more American than Terra?
I don't know.
Yeah, for anyone who doesn't know, Terra's original name in the Japanese Final Fantasy VI was Tina.
Oh, wait, no, I guess that's the other way around.
That's right.
I've played the Japanese one.
So I'm sorry, yeah, I guess it was Terra here.
Were they going for maybe the double entendre, where Terra's kind of like Earth?
I don't... Maybe.
I don't know.
Seems a little silly.
It's just like the whole Eris, Aerith thing.
Isn't it?
Aerith makes more sense, but then again, if you translate it by the kana, it would kind of... Aerith would also make sense for translation purposes.
Hmm.
Well, one thing that Jamie probably uses to do her translation is several websites out there on the internet.
And certainly she likes to surf the internet up and down and back and forth every week finding her favorites of the internet.
And it makes up DarkSakura's website of the week.
DarkSakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers this week?
You should actually be going to PayPal and send me money.
No, really.
And it's not a Doctor Who site.
Okay, I'll do one next week.
Okay.
The website of the week is MassageTherapy.com I've been spending a lot of time there because I'm in school to be a massage therapist.
It's really good though because it has a lot about learning about massage, finding a massage therapist for your own needs, media.
One thing that I really think is cool in here is there's a body work glossary in here.
that lists out a lot of different things you might hear as far as naturopathy, different type of health-related things.
I think it's really cool.
I've learned actually a lot of different modalities just reading through the freaking glossary.
So if anyone is into, even if you're not a massage therapist, even if you don't receive massage, if you're into natural health, it's really worth looking through, and it's been very, very educational to me.
SSJ100 Matt says, Jamie, there's no happy ending section.
Okay.
People who give happy endings are not real massage therapists.
Now, is that MassageTherapist.com or MassageTheRapist.com?
It's Massage Therapy.
I don't think that's very funny since this is, you know, my chosen profession.
A joke.
Jamie, it's a little joke.
A little humor.
I know, but I don't think it's a funny joke because it's... I thought it was funny.
He thought it was funny.
Have a little humor.
Are either of you massage therapists?
No.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
No, all kidding aside, you may think at first glance that this has nothing to do with gaming, but I say, you know what, if your ass starts to feel numb from so much hardcore gaming, or your back starts, maybe massage therapy's for you.
You know what I've noticed?
I, actually, since I've started doing massage, as in giving massage, my endurance in cardiovascular work, aerobics, has greatly improved.
So, giving a massage is just as healthy as receiving one if you do it the right way.
It's good for everybody.
Alright.
Anyways.
Speaking of unhappy endings, apparently there's actually going to be a price increase, sort of, in the Canadian PlayStation 3s.
Wait, a price increase for the PlayStation 3?
Somebody screwed up somewhere, big time.
Someone apparently listened to our contest that we had, you know, with the...
PlayStation 3, and more.
99.99.
It says both Best Buy and Future Shop have the console listed at the new price.
And it says the old list price used to be 659.99.
Hasn't the console already been out there for some time?
I guess that they're increasing price.
But here's my thing though.
If
I don't know if they're having the same situation as we are here, but if they're like, you know, the consoles are rare there, maybe they're just raising prices because they can probably sell them for that.
At least throw in a free game, jeez.
I don't know.
That's silly.
Because, you know, Canada sometimes gets bundle packs that we don't get here.
So, but yeah, I guess whatever the case is, they're getting hosed over there, so.
Well, you know, we don't mean to keep picking on Sony, but look, guys, they just
Keep giving us material, what can we say?
And Major Nelson over from Microsoft's camp was very quick to point out this week that Sony made a big fat boo-boo on one of their sites.
There was a PSP site touting video downloads, and one of the video downloads was for Gran Turismo HD Concept.
It was one of the things you could download, try to get people psyched about the PlayStation 3.
Well, they had a screenshot on the website from Gran Turismo HD, but, oops, it wasn't actually a screenshot of Gran Turismo HD.
It was a screenshot of Project Gotham Racing 3 on Xbox 360.
I mean, talk about a fuck-up.
I mean, that is... You know that that's just some tiny little mistake some intern probably made somewhere, but still, I mean, not... Where was the QA on that?
Something got screwed up big time.
And to kind of follow up with that story I was just talking about, according to a Sony rep...
That is the actual case.
It says, although the suggested retail price of the PlayStation 3 in Canada has not changed, some Canadian retailers have chosen to increase their retail price as a result of the weaker Canadian dollar.
This increase is solely at the discretion of the retailer, as Sony Computer Entertainment Canada has not issued a price increase.
Thank you for the clarification.
That makes more sense.
Thank you.
I like our chatroom comments.
GS68 pokes fun at the Ridge Racer phenomenon going, it's Project Gotham!
Project Gotham!
Get it?
I know, it doesn't have the same thing to it, but I see what he did there.
That's pretty good.
Well, Sony's still, though.
They still have something shoved up their ass, I think.
Yeah, you remember us talking about that Ghostbusters game?
I do!
Well, Zoofly did confirm that they wore
Preliminary working on one for Xbox 360.
Sony Pictures, however, has pretty much told Zootfly to shut up, pretty much.
They've removed the content from their website because of Sony.
Any of the content on YouTube has been removed.
Maybe that just was a breach of NDA, I think.
Heaven forbid someone put something out there that got people excited for Sony.
Or it could be the fact that Sony owns the rights to the Ghostbusters movies.
Well, I don't know, whatever.
Wasn't the game being created for Sony?
No, it was being created by Zootfly, and they have to get everyone's permission, or they hadn't gotten the permission from any of the actors.
But wasn't it being created by them for a Sony console?
No, it's just being created by them because they like Ghostbusters.
Oh, I totally misread that story the first time.
That's all right.
Interesting.
Well, yeah, okay, then I guess Sony was just protecting their rights.
They're well within their rights.
I get it.
Well, still, it's never fun to hear about games going away that we were a little bit excited for.
In fact, it makes us a little bit angsty.
I don't know about you guys, but I get pretty pissed off when games I get excited for get cancelled.
And that calls for some FUs of the week.
Right, boys and girls?
Oh yeah.
I guess.
The first FU of the week that I have goes towards the...
We're in terror on my car.
I mean, really, it's not anything that I didn't expect.
You know, you drive your car on road trips, it's gonna wear out.
But just, it was really kind of freaking me out last night.
I didn't expect it to just start grinding that suddenly.
And of course, we shelled out $150 for parts.
Thankfully, we have a friend who can replace brakes.
And brakes on the Mitsubishi Lancer are very thick and easy to replace.
What, Robb?
I'm not you.
I'm thinking about something else.
It's not related.
Am I not allowed to laugh and have a good time at this show?
Not when I'm talking about my car.
No, he can laugh.
So yeah, a big, big, major Uber FU goes to my car not being immortal, I guess.
And another one goes to Rob for parking like an asshole.
You know what?
Because I had to pick your ass up because your car was in the shop.
Had I not had to pick your ass up, I wouldn't have had to repark the car.
Rob, tell me, how many times have you been in the car with me when I pulled into a spot and then backed up and adjusted my parking?
I don't give a fuck!
I had to contort myself to get out of your damn car.
And no thank you for the ride or anything like that.
You park like an asshole, you jerk.
I thanked you for the ride when you picked me up and I gave you cookies.
I gave you cookies!
Okay, the cookie was good.
My cookies are great.
My cookies bring all the rubs to my house.
I'm bringing more cookies next week, too.
Loki.
Fuck, you did a superwoman that was in front of me when I was trying to get out of my apartment complex today because she saw us behind her and she walked slower because she's a jackass.
Also, another thing, what the hell's the point?
I'm looking at decalgirl.com and they have a skin that you can buy for your PlayStation 3 that's black.
That's like stupid.
Why the hell would I cover my PlayStation 3 with a skin that's the same color as the goddamn PlayStation 3?
I don't know.
Why?
I don't know.
Because you're an idiot, I guess.
So fuck them.
I just want to give an FU of the week to my Saturday, because it kind of sucked, because I had a migraine, which sucks.
Like, they really suck.
I don't get them very often.
When I do, it really sucks.
And so I had that, and then I got sick off of dinner, and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All those music game franchises, they're so old.
Anyways, so to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Bomani, Konami is holding a pop and music culture festival at Tokyo's Lafayette Museum.
So that's pretty awesome.
Lots of festivities going along with that.
Artists performing, DJs, etc.
And I'm sure I, like most people, had similar reactions where it's like, 10 years?
It's been 10 freaking years?
God, I'm old.
I know, seriously.
I don't know about you guys, but that's my reaction.
I remember, you know, when I first saw Bomani, you know, I remember it was at Fanime, and we went up to one of the rooms that was there, and they were playing Beatmania on a PlayStation 3.
and they were playing, I remember the song too, it was the Metal Gear Solid theme and I was just like, fucking A, that's awesome.
I was like, I gotta buy this.
So I did and I played it and I stopped playing it and then next time I saw DDR4th Mix and I was like, ooh, I gotta get that too.
And then next thing you know, I'm going to the arcades and I meet these crazy people and they're doing a radio show and my life just spiraled downhill.
And here you are, yes, it's all downhill from there.
What was your first Bimani?
The very first time I saw Bimani, I went to Milpitas Golf Land to play golf, and I saw a bunch of people dancing on the machine.
It looked like fun, because I was playing Busta Groove 2 on the PlayStation at the time.
I did not know anything about Japanese imports at the time, so I was playing Busta Groove 2.
I'm forgiving you.
Part of me is.
The other part of my heart is breaking.
Well, let it break.
You're too sassy tonight.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
in Las Vegas.
I played at Circus Circus with a guana girl who ended up going on to be some big admin over at that DDR Freak site.
But I don't think she really plays much anymore.
So that was my first game.
She doesn't admin much anymore either.
But my first was, and you're going to laugh at this, was when I still lived in Alabama playing BM98.
You remember BM98?
Loki left the room.
I'm stealing a french fry.
Give me one too.
You want one too?
Okay.
Give me his toast.
You want his toast?
Here you go.
Here's a fry.
Don't tell.
Okay, yes, BM98, yeah?
Uh-huh.
BM98 was awesome because it was customizable.
It was one of... I think it was honestly one of the precursors to many of our simulators today.
And, you know, so I got to play a lot of the early Beatmania songs probably right around...
Actually, yeah, 1998.
And then my first DDR was playing the first Mix Home one when I moved out here from Alabama.
And then I played my first actual machine at... Don't glare at me.
She took one, too.
Rob took it for me, though.
Is that my 7-up?
Is that my 7-up?
Then I get a fry.
Oh, I don't care if you're eating my food.
Rob, go get me a root beer.
Do I look like your bitch?
Yes.
Rob wants to go get me a root beer.
That's awesome.
But I honestly think that the simulators like BM98 got a lot of people in the very early days of Bimani into these games who might not have otherwise had access to them.
I remember trying to make
Make a file a long ass time ago for BM98 and I just couldn't do it because I got really bored doing it.
And from what I understand, actually, it's sort of seeing a resurgence in fan communities.
I think that's kind of cool.
My favorite, though, has to be Delight Delight Reduplication.
I still have that.
Somewhere.
I remember how awesome it was when Dance with Intensity came out, and it was just like, wow, this is so much better, and then Step Media came out, and that was pretty cool too, but who'd have thought?
Although, slightly related to the family of Bimani games is one, the really horrid game that I think Konami should disavow any knowledge of, and that's Dance Dance Dance.
It was shitty.
In my professional opinion, as an internet celebrity.
Don't you hate it when you think of good ideas, like right when you get back in the chair and somebody in the chat room actually said it.
Bandit says, bet he shakes the can.
That would have been an awesome idea.
No, it didn't.
Especially because Jamie's working on her laptop.
She would have cried.
No, I would have picked up my destroyed laptop and thrown it at your PC.
That would have been a fun show.
Suddenly we're knocked off air.
And then JeremyTodd1 would like to point this out.
He sent this to me in a message there in the chat room.
And he's sent me a little slip from youparklikeanasshole.com.
Although I'd like to point out he didn't even see it, JeremyTodd1.
He checked off two spots, one car, a little too close, over the painted lines, diagonal parking, cool car, diagonal parking, not so cool car.
And then he checked off other for sucking.
For sucking.
DMN agrees with me and JeremyTodd1, by the way.
For this, JeremyTodd1 gets a kick from the chatroom.
We'll just do that.
Control, kick.
There we go.
Nice good kick from the chatroom.
DMN wanted me to punch you in the arm, and he gave me a heart if I did it.
So, I'm gonna punch Robin.
No!
I got you a gut!
Ow!
You're a real bitch tonight.
I am not!
I'm nice.
I gave you cookies.
It's always the cookies.
It always comes back to the cookies.
I know.
You did it all for the cookie.
All right.
Did everybody have fun reminiscing about the Bimani?
Yes, and thank you for my root beer.
You're welcome.
All right.
Harmonix talked this week a little bit about something that's not Bimani related because, you know, Harmonix didn't make Bimani, but certainly they're a huge, huge player in the music video game franchise, and they are talking about the guitar.
Well, technically they did kind of.
DarkSakura,
One of the folks that works over at Harmonix, and that would be Daniel Sussman, who is a producer over Harmonix, quote, Here's the official line.
Harmonix can confirm that we are not developing Guitar Hero 3.
And that backs up the story from last week about Neversoft, who did the Tony Hawk games, are taking over that.
He also said this, quote, We are instead working on a different music game project, one that is bigger and more ambitious endeavor than we felt we could pursue with the balance of the Guitar Hero franchise.
Further specific details on the exact subject and publisher for the game are not yet released.
We'll see.
You know what I'm thinking, though?
A lot of people are going, Oh, it's Guitar Hero, or it's Guitar Villain, or it's Drum Hero, or it's Keyboard Hero, or it's a sequel to Amplitude or Frequency.
I think when this guy uses terms like we are working on a different music game project that is bigger and more ambitious, I think it's bigger than all that.
I think it's different.
I think it's something brand new you haven't even thought of yet.
I think it's called Hugh Jass Symphony the game.
I think it's just some new concept we don't even know yet until we hear it.
I think it's Oonga Boonga.
It's Guns N' Roses the game, an ego bigger than Axl Rose.
Well, speaking of Guitar Hero, at least Guitar Hero 2 for Xbox Live...
The multiplayer dream has crashed and burned.
The guitar still has the microphone in it, too, but there's no online multiplayer.
All of the modes, co-op face-off, pro face-off modes, are offline only.
Because of lag, probably.
Sorry, y'all.
Yeah, it's gotta be lag.
I'm pretty much thinking so.
But I still think it's cool, though.
You know, the downloadable packs, because it really gives the experience very similar, I think, to Karaoke Revolution on Xbox, but it really gives the game a really, I'd say, a lot of replayability.
They should just add, well, I'm sure they'll have a leaderboard of some sort.
They need the war pack.
So that's what they just need to do, is stick with the leaderboards.
I've given Guitar Hero a little bit of crap on this show just because I don't foam at the mouth over it like everyone else does.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love Guitar Hero.
It's so awesome.
And I actually prefer it to Guitar Freaks.
I really do.
Which for somebody with a Bomani, you know, a heart Konami type thing is a huge thing to say.
I know.
It bypasses your Bomani boner.
Kind of.
In the guitar region it does.
I would have five hard-ons somehow if they would make a keyboard game like they did Guitar Hero.
I really would because I love keyboard mania.
If you had five hard-ons, you would probably be Edward Penishands.
Probably.
I don't know how it would happen.
That's a reference I hadn't heard in forever.
I would totally be happy if they would do that, but
I am getting more and more excited about its release on the 360.
I'm pumped for it.
I'm going to definitely pick it up when it comes out.
What about DDR on 360?
You know what?
There's some new videos that hit the internet this week, and I think it looks great.
I'm really excited about it.
I think it's going to be an awesome game.
I think my neighbors are going to hate me.
Mine are going to hate me too, and I finally need to get my dance pad back from Jamie.
She's had it for like a year and a half.
I gave it back to you.
One of the steps didn't work.
No, no, that was the old dance pad.
You took my other one, because remember when there was a Guitar Hero story?
It was in the background.
No, you took that back with you.
I gave it back to you.
No, I don't have it.
Well, then it's probably in the vault.
She forgot to tell you that she sold it for pinball.
She probably did.
No, Dan sold it for pinball.
She sold it for a pinball.
Dude, we got another freaking pinball machine, by the way.
We got an earth shaker.
Anyway.
I haven't even fucking heard of that.
The Rosie O'Donnell pinball machine, the Earthshaker.
Actually, Earthshaker is in the same family as Whirlwind.
It's pretty old school and awesome.
One of those machines that collectors want.
Anyway, I still want my Doctor Who pinball machine and Dan hasn't accommodated me.
Joshi16 has an interesting line in chat.
What would Brian Boitano do?
Get all the developers in town and make a game to amaze the noobs.
That's what Brian Boitano would do.
I tried to sing it.
That's fantastic.
It failed miserably because I had no voice.
That's okay.
You have an excuse this time.
I do.
Oh, this is exciting when DarkSakura is letting me have not just one but two buys tonight.
I got one for Busta Groove 2 and I got another for my voice.
I'm excited.
And you were calling me a bitch.
If the shoe fits.
Very accommodating, Rob.
I only punched you because DMN told me to.
Well, DMN's a bitch too.
He is, but we like his bitchiness.
You know there's nothing but heart for the Jamie.
Nothing but heart.
A bleeding heart.
There's a heart.
With a knife through it.
We're going to go to a quick break here and come back in a little bit with Orange Lounge Radio Part B because Jamie and I have to have a hug-a-thon to make up for all the fighting we're doing tonight.
So we're going to have a hug-a-thon during the break.
So we'll be back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
For those of you guys listening on our audio archive, also known as podcasting, we'll be back in a couple days, probably about Wednesday-ish, with Part B.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
